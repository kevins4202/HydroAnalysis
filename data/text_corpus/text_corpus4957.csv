comparative investigations on their ecological adaptations with bacteria in the hot spring environment have been rather limited eme et al 2018 hot springs as natural water environments distributed all over the world are characterized by diverse physicochemical conditions including some extreme conditions of temperature acidic or alkaline phs concentrations of salts and metals and etc lópez lópez et

2016 barns et al 1994 1996 stetter 2013 the microbial community structures at geothermal environments strongly depend on physicochemical factors of the geographical sites a number of existing studies suggested that temperature and ph directly or indirectly affect the microbial composition and biodiversity in hot springs for example some studies on the hot springs in the yellowstone national park ynp of the usa which is one of the largest and most diverse hydrothermal areas on earth with more than 10000 thermal springs showing broad ranges of temperature ph and geochemical properties found that archaea of the order sulfolobales and thermoproteales mainly inhabited high temperature acidic springs while bacteria of the order aquificales like living in alkaline springs inskeep et al 2010 2013b more recently jiang and takacsvesbach 2017 investigated microbial communities of highly acidic ph 4 hot springs in the ynp and revealed that the microbial compositions varied among the sites with similar ph values they assumed that temperature and geochemistry of the waters could have contributed to the variability of the microbial composition jiang and takacsvesbach 2017 temperature has also been shown to influence the microbial composition in hot springs sharp et al 2014 collected 165 microbial samples from 36 geothermal areas from both northern and southern hemispheres with the temperature range of 7 5 99 c and the ph range of 1 8 9 0 they found that temperature plays a more important role than ph in influencing microbial diversity and the structures of microbiome shifted with temperature and ph sharp et al 2014 some studies found that in hot springs with higher temperature 75 c the bacterial communities mainly consisted of the phyla firmicutes and proteobacteria and archaeal communities mainly consisted of the phyla crenarchaeota euryarchaeota and parvarchaeota song et al 2013 hou et al 2013 chan et al 2015 2017 badhai et al 2015 found that in hot springs with 40 58 c majority of the classified microbiome were bacteria and only 1 7 were archaea in addition the phyla cyanobacteria and chloroflexiwere the main bacteria population badhai et al 2015 the tolerance to acid and alkali may be different between bacteria and archaea in geothermal environments therefore the ratios of bacteria to archaea of acidic and alkaline springs may have significant differences of course the influences of ph and extreme temperatures to the bacteria and archaea are usually mixed with each other bacteria are predominant in most of the alkaline springs which often included the phyla chloroflexi and cyanobacteria inskeep et al 2010 2013b poddar and das 2018 in contrast the archaea in alkaline springs are usually a smaller fraction of the total biomass inskeep et al 2013b badhai et al 2015 the dominance of bacterial community over archaeal community has been observed in most hot springs investigated in india all of which are alkaline springs ph ranged 6 8 10 poddar and das 2018 on the contrary archaea particularly the phyla of crenarchaeota and euryarchaeota appear to predominate the microbial communities in acidic vapor dominated and higher temperature hot springs inskeep et al 2013a jiang et al 2017 colman et al 2018 recently colman et al 2018 studied 72 hyperacidic ph 3 0 hydrothermal hot springs in the ynp and discovered that there were more archaea species than bacteria species in these hyperacidic hydrothermal environments the dominant residents are a limited number of archaeal lineages these thermoacidophilicarchaea were thought to possess the ability to respire o2 the dominance of archaeal population over bacteria has also been observed in an acidic ph 2 5 new zealand hot spring when temperatures exceed 65 c ward et al 2017 and in the hottest and most acidic of 20 ynp hot spring metagenomes inskeep et al 2013a valentine 2007 suggested that archaea are better adapted than bacteria in acidic thermal habitats xie et al 2015 hypothesized that the high adaptation of archaea to low ph is achieved by altering the composition of membrane lipids additionally the archaeal community structure has also been observed to be associated with the archaea dominance of hyperacidic hydrothermal hot springs pearson et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 xie et al 2015 beside ph and temperature the influences of other physico chemical conditions on shaping the hot spring microbiome have also been reported e g chiriacet al 2017 valerianiet al 2018 besides summarizing the effects of environmental factors especially temperatures and ph on the hot spring microbiome one additional characteristic we can see from the previous brief review is that most studies have been focused on species composition and community diversity and the methodology was primarily ecological analysis in particular the diversity analysis one aspect that is largely missing in existing studies on hot spring microbiome is the species interaction as well as the interactions between environmental factors and individual species in the microbiome complex network analysis offers a powerful tool to investigate such interactions faust raes 2012 faust et al 2012 ma et al 2015 2016a

networks such as deng et al 2012 and kurtz et al 2015 which we do not used in this study indeed ecological network analysis has been successfully applied to the study of microbial networks in the human microbiome and also in other microbiome habitats e g steele et al 2011 faust et al 2012 fernandez et al 2015 ma et al 2015 2016a 2016b ramayo caldas et al 2016 layeghifard et al 2017 claussen et al 2017 leung et al 2018 for example the network analysis was applied to investigate a progression of marine microbial communities through time and found possibly symbiotic or parasitic relationships steele et al 2011 faust et al 2012 constructed microbial networks from the hmp human microbiome project hmp datasets and they found that most of the human microbiome was highly localized with co occurrence patterns within specific body site suggesting that the human microbiome has strong niche specialization faust et al 2012 ma et al 2015 analyzed milk microbiome network and they found that there was an evil alliance between opportunistic pathogens in the network and the alliance were inhibited by the alliance of harmless microbiome they suggested that the mastitis might be caused by the inability of the good alliance to inhibit the bad alliance claussenet al 2017 applied boolean analysis for studying the interactions between low abundance species in the human gut microbiome the network approaches have also been used to study the influence of host and lifestyle factors on the structure of skin microbial networks over time leung et al 2018 in the field of research on hot spring microbiomes bolduc et al 2015 investigation on the virome network in the acidic hydrothermal hot springs in ynp appears to be the only study that applied network analysis their investigation identified viral groups which may represent viral families in the viral assemblage they studied bolduc et al 2015 quantitative analyses on how archaea and bacteria may adapt to different geothermal environments different temperatures in a complex network setting have not been conducted to the best of our knowledge we aim to fill this gap by applying complex network analysis for analyzing the 165 hot spring microbiome samples originally taken globally by sharp et al 2014 given the large datasets as well as the wide range of the temperature 7 5 c 99 c and ph value 1 8 9 0 we have an ideal dataset to conduct the analysis specifically we aim to investigate the species interactions and species temperature interactions species ph interactions in hot spring microbiomes with complex network analysis techniques we further aim to investigate possible ecological guilds as well as the possible niche differentiation between archaea and bacteria along the spectrum of the temperature and or ph as a side note although we use the terms including ecological networks complex networks or network analyses interchangeably through the article there are subtle differences between these terms although the term complex network appears to be more widely used in current scientific literatures ecologists and also social scientists had been exploring network analyses since the 1970s or even earlier well before the complex network analysis became well established in the 1990s perhaps due to highly data demanding nature of ecological network analyses especially in the fields of food webs and species interactions e g fathet al 2007 ma et al 2016a ma ellison 2019 studies of ecological networks particular microbial ecological networks with traditional ecological network approaches seem more difficult to perform this may explain the currently general lacking of ecological network analyses of hot spring microbiomes in the following sections our approaches are largely drawn from the complex network analysis specifically correlation network which uses relatively simple correlation relationship between microbial species abundances to infer species co occurrence relationships as well as species interactions obviously species occurrences are not equivalent to species interactions therefore constrained by the state of the art data collection techniques in microbiome research i e metagenomic sequencing technology the results we reported may have limitations compared with the inferences from traditional ecological networks such as those constructed from sophisticated trophic experiments material and methods the hot spring microbiome datasets the datasets of hot spring microbiomes are from a large scale amplicon sequencing study originally performed and reported by sharp et al 2014 which included 165 samples from 36 hot springs in canada 121 samples and new zealand 44 samples in those 165 hot spring samples the temperatures ranged between 7 5 c and 99 c and ph values ranged between 1 8 and 9 0 the 16s rrna sequencing data were obtained through amplicon sequencing and the otu tables for bacteria and archaea were computed with qiime software package 16s rrna genes were amplified using flx titanium amplicon primers 926fw and 1392r which encompass the v8 variable region of the 16s rrna gene from bacteria and archaea taxonomic identification of each otu was determined using nucleotide blast against the silva 108 core set detailed sampling sequencing and computational procedures are referred to sharp et al 2014 the network analysis approach we utilized a standard approach for correlation network analysis e g junker schreiber 2018 ma et al 2015 2016a 2016b to reconstruct and analyze the hot spring microbiome network with the 16s rrna datasets originally reported in sharp et al 2014 to cancel the noise effect of the otus with extremely low abundance and potentially spurious otu reads we removed the otus whose total reads in all 165 samples were less than 300 i e with an average abundance per sample less than 2 in the whole datasets a total of 560 otus remain after the removal operation and their abundances were utilized to calculate spearman s rank correlation coefficient r and to construct species correlation network the correlation relationships with p value 0 05 significance level after fdr false discovery rate adjustment were set as criteria for selecting the network edges links cytoscape software version 2 8 3 shannon et al 2003 junker schreiber 2008 was adopted to visualize the network and the mcode plug in bader and hogue 2003 for cytoscape was utilized to detect network clusters modules in addition we used igraph r package csardi and nepusz 2005 to compute the basic network properties the following formula was used to calculate the spearman rank correlation best and roberts 1975 in igraph r package r 1 6 d i 2 n n 2 1 where r is spearman rank correlation d is the difference between the ranks of corresponding pair variables n is the number of data points p value 0 05 was set as the level for determining the significance level of the correlation relationship between otus or between otus and environmental factors temperature and ph all correlation relationships that passed the significance level test were admitted to the networks and fed into the above mentioned cytoscape software mcode plug in and igraph r package for visualizing the complex networks detecting network modules and computing network properties to investigate the relationship between the environmental factors specifically temperature and ph with individual microbial species we simply treated both the factors as if they were special microbial otus and hence could be included in the complex networks constructed with the microbial otu abundance data it should be noted that the inferences of microbial species interactions from the correlation relationship among species are imperfect since correlations in terms of species abundances do not necessarily imply causal relationships similarly our usage of terms such as competitive vs cooperative relationships inferred from negative vs positive correlations is not perfect either results and discussion network properties and species interactions of hot spring microbiome network table 1 listed the basic network properties of the global hot spring microbiome network we constructed based on the computational procedure and criteria described in the previous section and fig 1 plotted the network graph the network contained 560 nodes the otu at the species level and 24113 edges links including 23323 positive links collaborative correlations and 790 negative links competitive correlations the ratio of positive to negative correlation relationships or the p n ratio was approximately 30 which suggests that the hot spring network is predominantly mutualistic ma 2017 table 2 summarized the species interactions correlations within archaea within bacteria as well as between archaea and bacteria respectively as shown in table 2 in the hot spring microbiome network nearly 62 of the negative links occurred within bacteria and 37 were between the two domains there were only 6 negative links occurred within archaea the p n ratios of intra archaea intra bacteria and inter archaea bacteria archaeavs bacteria relationships were 268 7 33 6 and 17 9 respectively that is the negative interactions occurred predominantly within the species of bacteria or between the species from bacteria and the species from archaea particularly in the former the negative interactions were extremely rare within the species of archaea less than 1 the averages of the correlation coefficients r of intra archaea intra bacteria inter archaea bacteria of their respective negative links were close to each other all approximately 0 2 the above results suggest that the competition is extremely rare within archaea which could be attributed to the longer evolutionary history of archaea than that of bacteria that is competitions within archaea were selected against in the long evolutionary process species ph interactions the relationship between species abundance and ph as shown in table 3 ph held 13 positive and 29 negative links with archaea respectively and held 101 positive and 9 negative links with bacteria respectively that is ph preferred connecting with negative links to connecting with positive links within archaea but the preference was opposite within bacteria table 3 also listed the inventory of ph negatively connected links these results showed that there were more acid tolerant archaea species 29 than acid tolerant bacteria species 9 and there were fewer alkaline tolerant archaea species 13 than alkaline tolerant bacteria species 101 indicating the niche differentiation between archaea and bacteria in addition table 3 showed that the average link strengths measured in r were similar between ph archaea links and ph bacteria links although the numbers of links between the two types of links were significantly different the above finding is supported by several existing studies e g inskeep et al 2013a 2013b badhai et al 2015 jiang and takacsvesbach 2017 colman et al 2018 poddar and das 2018 archaea predominate in the hyperacidic hydrothermal hot springs inskeep et al 2013a jiang and takacsvesbach 2017 colman et al 2018 sharp et al 2014 but there are usually very few in the alkaline springs inskeep et al 2013b badhai et al 2015 the phyla ofcrenarchaeota and euryarchaeotamainly consisted of the archaeal communities of acidic hydrothermal hot springs inskeep et al 2013a jiang and takacsvesbach 2017 colman et al 2018 the distribution of bacteria is usually opposite with that of archaea inskeepet al 2010 2013b poddar and das 2018 i e bacteria dominated in the alkaline hot springs poddar and das 2018 the special structures of membrane lipids pearson et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 xie et al 2015 and the ability to integrate o2 into respiration colman et al 2018 can also explain the acid tolerance of archaea in acid hot springs besides geothermal environments some studies have also found that ph is the most influential factor in shaping the archaeal community of other environments such as the coastal mangrove wetlands soils zhou et al 2017 tripathi et al 2013 this has also been observed in thaumarchaea abundant in virtually environments e g lehtovirta morley et al 2016 nicol et al 2008 herbold et al 2017 prosser and nicol 2012 species temperature interactions the relationship between species abundance and temperatures as shown in table 4 temperature held 4 positive links and 13 negative links with bacteria there were 3 positive correlations and no negative correlations between temperature and archaea the results show that absolute majority of bacteria and archaea are not sensitive to the temperature and only a handful of species are sensitive to temperatures bacteria have slightly more species 13 who are thermo phobic and no archaea are thermo phobic all studied crenarchaeota which is one of the main phyla of the archaea in the hot spring another main phylum is the euryarchaeota had been thermophilic or hyper thermophilic the euryarchaeotaalso include some extremely thermophiles inskeep et al 2013a jiang and takacsvesbach 2017 colman et al 2018 the overall lack of temperature sensitivity of hot spring microbes suggest most bacterial species are well adapted to hot spring environments and only a handful bacteria struggle with extreme high temperatures furthermore all archaea species are well adapted to higher temperatures and none of archaea species are thermo phobic analyzing niche differentiation between archaea and bacteria by searching for ecological guilds in the hot spring microbiome network using the mcode plug in for cytoscape we detected 15 clusters in the hot spring microbiome network table 5 listed the 15 clusters we detected with mcode including the cluster number cluster score number of nodes and number of edges links for each cluster the cluster score is a measure of the cluster density strength the higher the cluster score is and the stronger the corresponding cluster is except for clusters 3 and 4 the top 6 strongest clusters score 5 mostly consisted of the otus from bacteria fig s1 s6 in clusters 3 and 4 archaea species are in majority furthermore archaea species within cluster 3 or within cluster 4 form sub clusters in cluster 4 both sub clusters consisted of archaea mostly in cluster 3 one sub cluster is dominated by archaea and the other is a mixture of archaea bacteria the ph was classified into the bacteria dominant 1 cluster holding positive links with almost all of the otus in this cluster fig s1 but the temperature did not appear in any of the top 6 clusters figs 2 3 illustrated the relationships among top 4 clusters in the hot spring microbiome network fig 3 was drawn to emphasize the primarily negative links between cluster 1 and other 3 clusters by hiding the central cluster 1 the relationships between clusters 1 and 4 are worthy of particular mentioning fig 4 in fig 4 the semicircle shaped cluster 1 is bacteria dominant and the top two circles formed the archaea dominantcluster 4 the two circles represents for the two sub clusters of cluster 4 the relationship between cluster 1 and 4 can be characterized by the following features i cluster 4 is an internally fully cooperative network without any negative interactions and both sub clusters are dominated by archaea species there was only one link positive connecting both sub clusters and therefore the two sub clusters were rather independent with each other ii all of the positive links between the bacteria dominant cluster 1 and archaea dominant cluster 4 occurred in the larger left sub cluster and there was no positive links between cluster 1 and the other sub cluster of cluster 4 iii there are 20 5 15 out of 73 negative links between cluster 1 and left sub cluster of cluster 4 most of the negative links 79 5 58 out of 73 between 1 and 4 occurred with the right smaller sub cluster of 4 in which 45 26 out of 58 negative links occurred via ph seetable s2 v while ph belonging to bacteria dominant cluster 1 held exclusively positive links within its home cluster it held exclusively negative links with archaea dominant cluster 4 also see table s2 the above explained results suggest that in the hot spring microbiome network archaea and bacteria form their own guilds and occupy their own niches the division of niche may be accomplished through environmental factor ph bacteria prefer the alkaline side and archaea prefer acid side of the spectrum of ph values as further shown in table s2 in the osi and table 6 below there were approximately 46 46 101 of otus from the phylum proteobacteria in cluster 1 and 29 out of the 46 otus from proteobacteria held negative links with 4 cluster this indicates the critical importance of proteobacteria in shaping the structure and niche differentiations in the hot spring microbiome network conclusions and limitations of the study this study was aimed to investigate the ecologically adaptive differences between archaea and bacteria as well as their relationships with the two hallmark environmental factors of the hot spring i e temperature and ph we summarize the following findings from our attempt first archaea and bacteria differ in their internal interactions archaea seem to lack internal competitions or competitions are extremely rare while competitions appear to be abundant within bacteria species second archaea and bacteria can form their own guilds and occupy their respective niches furthermore ph seems to play an important role in the niche differentiations third the abundances of most bacteria and archaea species may not be correlated to the temperature this of course does not exclude the existence of small number of species whose abundances are strongly correlated with temperatures bacteria have slightly more species that are thermo phobic and no archaea are thermo phobic fourth the temperature may have far more significant influences on species compositions than on species abundance in other words most resident species can prosper in a wide range of temperatures but some nonresidents may encounter difficulties to survive which is consistent with the classic biogeography dogma of microbes microbes may reach everywhere but environment selects who can stay since to the best of our knowledge this study should be the first study of hot spring microbiomes with network analysis we could not perform direct comparative analysis with existing studies in the previous section we have discussed the comparisons with the results from non network analyses in existing studies limitations of our study include the lack of consideration of the physicochemical properties as well as the failure to analyze the interaction effects of temperature and ph we hope future investigations will fill the gaps in our study in addition network analysis is not silver bullet either and should be supplemented with other ecological analysis approaches such as demonstrated in our other studies li ma 2019a 2019b 2019c 2020 declaration of competing interest

spring microbiomes bolduc et al 2015 investigation on the virome network in the acidic hydrothermal hot springs in ynp appears to be the only study that applied network analysis their investigation identified viral groups which may represent viral families in the viral assemblage they studied bolduc et al 2015 quantitative analyses on how archaea and bacteria may adapt to different geothermal environments different temperatures in a complex network setting have not been conducted to the best of our knowledge we aim to fill this gap by applying complex network analysis for analyzing the 165 hot spring microbiome samples originally taken globally by sharp et al 2014 given the large datasets as well as the wide range of the temperature 7 5 c 99 c and ph value 1 8 9 0 we have an ideal dataset to conduct the analysis specifically we aim to investigate the species interactions and species temperature interactions species ph interactions in hot spring microbiomes with complex network analysis techniques we further aim to investigate possible ecological guilds as well as the possible niche differentiation between archaea and bacteria along the spectrum of the temperature and or ph as a side note although we use the terms including ecological networks complex networks or network analyses interchangeably through the article there are subtle differences between these terms although the term complex network appears to be more widely used in current scientific literatures ecologists and also social scientists had been exploring network analyses since the 1970s or even earlier well before the complex network analysis became well established in the 1990s perhaps due to highly data demanding nature of ecological network analyses especially in the fields of food webs and species interactions e g fathet al 2007 ma et al 2016a ma ellison 2019 studies of ecological networks particular microbial ecological networks with traditional ecological network approaches seem more difficult to perform this may explain the currently general lacking of ecological network analyses of hot spring microbiomes in the following sections our approaches are largely drawn from the complex network analysis specifically correlation network which uses relatively simple correlation relationship between microbial species abundances to infer species co occurrence relationships as well as species interactions obviously species occurrences are not equivalent to species interactions therefore constrained by the state of the art data collection techniques in microbiome research i e metagenomic sequencing technology the results we reported may have limitations compared with the inferences from traditional ecological networks such as those constructed from sophisticated trophic experiments material and methods the hot spring microbiome datasets the datasets of hot spring microbiomes are from a large scale amplicon sequencing study originally performed and reported by sharp et al 2014 which included 165 samples from 36 hot springs in canada 121 samples and new zealand 44 samples in those 165 hot spring samples the temperatures ranged between 7 5 c and 99 c and ph values ranged between 1 8 and 9 0 the 16s rrna sequencing data were obtained through amplicon sequencing and the otu tables for bacteria and archaea were computed with qiime software package 16s rrna genes were amplified using flx titanium amplicon primers 926fw and 1392r which encompass the v8 variable region of the 16s rrna gene from bacteria and archaea taxonomic identification of each otu was determined using nucleotide blast against the silva 108 core set detailed sampling sequencing and computational procedures are referred to sharp et al 2014 the network analysis approach we utilized a standard approach for correlation network analysis e g junker schreiber 2018 ma et al 2015 2016a 2016b to reconstruct and analyze the hot spring microbiome network with the 16s rrna datasets originally reported in sharp et al 2014 to cancel the noise effect of the otus with extremely low abundance and potentially spurious otu reads we removed the otus whose total reads in all 165 samples were less than 300 i e with an average abundance per sample less than 2 in the whole datasets a total of 560 otus remain after the removal operation and their abundances were utilized to calculate spearman s rank correlation coefficient r and to construct species correlation network the correlation relationships with p value 0 05 significance level after fdr false discovery rate adjustment were set as criteria for selecting the network edges links cytoscape software version 2 8 3 shannon et al 2003 junker schreiber 2008 was adopted to visualize the network and the mcode plug in bader and hogue 2003 for cytoscape was utilized to detect network clusters modules in addition we used igraph r package csardi and nepusz 2005 to compute the basic network properties the following formula was used to calculate the spearman rank correlation best and roberts 1975 in igraph r package r 1 6 d i 2 n n 2 1 where r is spearman rank correlation d is the difference between the ranks of corresponding pair variables n is the number of data points p value 0 05 was set as the level for determining the significance level of the correlation relationship between otus or between otus and environmental factors temperature and ph all correlation relationships that passed the significance level test were admitted to the networks and fed into the above mentioned cytoscape software mcode plug in and igraph r package for visualizing the complex networks detecting network modules and computing network properties to investigate the relationship between the environmental factors specifically temperature and ph with individual microbial species we simply treated both the factors as if they were special microbial otus and hence could be included in the complex networks constructed with the microbial otu abundance data it should be noted that the inferences of microbial species interactions from the correlation relationship among species are imperfect since correlations in terms of species abundances do not necessarily imply causal relationships similarly our usage of terms such as competitive vs cooperative relationships inferred from negative vs positive correlations is not perfect either results and discussion network properties and species interactions of hot spring microbiome network table 1 listed the basic network properties of the global hot spring microbiome network we constructed based on the computational procedure and criteria described in the previous section and fig 1 plotted the network graph the network contained 560 nodes the otu at the species level and 24113 edges links including 23323 positive links collaborative correlations and 790 negative links competitive correlations the ratio of positive to negative correlation relationships or the p n ratio was approximately 30 which suggests that the hot spring network is predominantly mutualistic ma 2017 table 2 summarized the species interactions correlations within archaea within bacteria as well as between archaea and bacteria respectively as shown in table 2 in the hot spring microbiome network nearly 62 of the negative links occurred within bacteria and 37 were between the two domains there were only 6 negative links occurred within archaea the p n ratios of intra archaea intra bacteria and inter archaea bacteria archaeavs bacteria relationships were 268 7 33 6 and 17 9 respectively that is the negative interactions occurred predominantly within the species of bacteria or between the species from bacteria and the species from archaea particularly in the former the negative interactions were extremely rare within the species of archaea less than 1 the averages of the correlation coefficients r of intra archaea intra bacteria inter archaea bacteria of their respective negative links were close to each other all approximately 0 2 the above results suggest that the competition is extremely rare within archaea which could be attributed to the longer evolutionary history of archaea than that of bacteria that is competitions within archaea were selected against in the long evolutionary process species ph interactions the relationship between species abundance and ph as shown in table 3 ph held 13 positive and 29 negative links with archaea respectively and held 101 positive and 9 negative links with bacteria respectively that is ph preferred connecting with negative links to connecting with positive links within archaea but the preference was opposite within bacteria table 3 also listed the inventory of ph negatively connected links these results showed that there were more acid tolerant archaea species 29 than acid tolerant bacteria species 9 and there were fewer alkaline tolerant archaea species 13 than alkaline tolerant bacteria species 101 indicating the niche differentiation between archaea and bacteria in addition table 3 showed that the average link strengths measured in r were similar between ph archaea links and ph bacteria links although the numbers of links between the two types of links were significantly different the above finding is supported by several existing studies e g inskeep et al 2013a 2013b badhai et al 2015 jiang and takacsvesbach 2017 colman et al 2018 poddar and das 2018 archaea predominate in the hyperacidic hydrothermal hot springs inskeep et al 2013a jiang and takacsvesbach 2017 colman et al 2018 sharp et al 2014 but there are usually very few in the alkaline springs inskeep et al 2013b badhai et al 2015 the phyla ofcrenarchaeota and euryarchaeotamainly consisted of the archaeal communities of acidic hydrothermal hot springs inskeep et al 2013a jiang and takacsvesbach 2017 colman et al 2018 the distribution of bacteria is usually opposite with that of archaea inskeepet al 2010 2013b poddar and das 2018 i e bacteria dominated in the alkaline hot springs poddar and das 2018 the special structures of membrane lipids pearson et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 xie et al 2015 and the ability to integrate o2 into respiration colman et al 2018 can also explain the acid tolerance of archaea in acid hot springs besides geothermal environments some studies have also found that ph is the most influential factor in shaping the archaeal community of other environments such as the coastal mangrove wetlands soils zhou et al 2017 tripathi et al 2013 this has also been observed in thaumarchaea abundant in virtually environments e g lehtovirta morley et al 2016 nicol et al 2008 herbold et al 2017 prosser and nicol 2012 species temperature interactions the relationship between species abundance and temperatures as shown in table 4 temperature held 4 positive links and 13 negative links with bacteria there were 3 positive correlations and no negative correlations between temperature and archaea the results show that absolute majority of bacteria and archaea are not sensitive to the temperature and only a handful of species are sensitive to temperatures bacteria have slightly more species 13 who are thermo phobic and no archaea are thermo phobic all studied crenarchaeota which is one of the main phyla of the archaea in the hot spring another main phylum is the euryarchaeota had been thermophilic or hyper thermophilic the euryarchaeotaalso include some extremely thermophiles inskeep et al 2013a jiang and takacsvesbach 2017 colman et al 2018 the overall lack of temperature sensitivity of hot spring microbes suggest most bacterial species are well adapted to hot spring environments and only a handful bacteria struggle with extreme high temperatures furthermore all archaea species are well adapted to higher temperatures and none of archaea species are thermo phobic analyzing niche differentiation between archaea and bacteria by searching for ecological guilds in the hot spring microbiome network using the mcode plug in for cytoscape we detected 15 clusters in the hot spring microbiome network table 5 listed the 15 clusters we detected with mcode including the cluster number cluster score number of nodes and number of edges links for each cluster the cluster score is a measure of the cluster density strength the higher the cluster score is and the stronger the corresponding cluster is except for clusters 3 and 4 the top 6 strongest clusters score 5 mostly consisted of the otus from bacteria fig s1 s6 in clusters 3 and 4 archaea species are in majority furthermore archaea species within cluster 3 or within cluster 4 form sub clusters in cluster 4 both sub clusters consisted of archaea mostly in cluster 3 one sub cluster is dominated by archaea and the other is a mixture of archaea bacteria the ph was classified into the bacteria dominant 1 cluster holding positive links with almost all of the otus in this cluster fig s1 but the temperature did not appear in any of the top 6 clusters figs 2 3 illustrated the relationships among top 4 clusters in the hot spring microbiome network fig 3 was drawn to emphasize the primarily negative links between cluster 1 and other 3 clusters by hiding the central cluster 1 the relationships between clusters 1 and 4 are worthy of particular mentioning fig 4 in fig 4 the semicircle shaped cluster 1 is bacteria dominant and the top two circles formed the archaea dominantcluster 4 the two circles represents for the two sub clusters of cluster 4 the relationship between cluster 1 and 4 can be characterized by the following features i cluster 4 is an internally fully cooperative network without any negative interactions and both sub clusters are dominated by archaea species there was only one link positive connecting both sub clusters and therefore the two sub clusters were rather independent with each other ii all of the positive links between the bacteria dominant cluster 1 and archaea dominant cluster 4 occurred in the larger left sub cluster and there was no positive links between cluster 1 and the other sub cluster of cluster 4 iii there are 20 5 15 out of 73 negative links between cluster 1 and left sub cluster of cluster 4 most of the negative links 79 5 58 out of 73 between 1 and 4 occurred with the right smaller sub cluster of 4 in which 45 26 out of 58 negative links occurred via ph seetable s2 v while ph belonging to bacteria dominant cluster 1 held exclusively positive links within its home cluster it held exclusively negative links with archaea dominant cluster 4 also see table s2 the above explained results suggest that in the hot spring microbiome network archaea and bacteria form their own guilds and occupy their own niches the division of niche may be accomplished through environmental factor ph bacteria prefer the alkaline side and archaea prefer acid side of the spectrum of ph values as further shown in table s2 in the osi and table 6 below there were approximately 46 46 101 of otus from the phylum proteobacteria in cluster 1 and 29 out of the 46 otus from proteobacteria held negative links with 4 cluster this indicates the critical importance of proteobacteria in shaping the structure and niche differentiations in the hot spring microbiome network conclusions and limitations of the study this study was aimed to investigate the ecologically adaptive differences between archaea and bacteria as well as their relationships with the two hallmark environmental factors of the hot spring i e temperature and ph we summarize the following findings from our attempt first archaea and bacteria differ in their internal interactions archaea seem to lack internal competitions or competitions are extremely rare while competitions appear to be abundant within bacteria species second archaea and bacteria can form their own guilds and occupy their respective niches furthermore ph seems to play an important role in the niche differentiations third the abundances of most bacteria and archaea species may not be correlated to the temperature this of course does not exclude the existence of small number of species whose abundances are strongly correlated with temperatures bacteria have slightly more species that are thermo phobic and no archaea are thermo phobic fourth the temperature may have far more significant influences on species compositions than on species abundance in other words most resident species can prosper in a wide range of temperatures but some nonresidents may encounter difficulties to survive which is consistent with the classic biogeography dogma of microbes microbes may reach everywhere but environment selects who can stay since to the best of our knowledge this study should be the first study of hot spring microbiomes with network analysis we could not perform direct comparative analysis with existing studies in the previous section we have discussed the comparisons with the results from non network analyses in existing studies limitations of our study include the lack of consideration of the physicochemical properties as well as the failure to analyze the interaction effects of temperature and ph we hope future investigations will fill the gaps in our study in addition network analysis is not silver bullet either and should be supplemented with other ecological analysis approaches such as demonstrated in our other studies li ma 2019a 2019b 2019c 2020 declaration of competing interest

24786,the degree of biological variability within a population is an important factor for its ecological success yet individual based population models ibms that utilize the dynamic energy budget deb theory as a mechanistic basis to simulate an individual s life history largely rely on rule of thumb estimates of inter individual variability of their parameter values in this study we explored how data from previous life history experiments with the copepod nitocra spinipes could be used to make realistic estimates of variability in deb parameter values for this species we specifically investigated to which one of 12 possible parameters variability should be added and what shape and scale its probability distribution should have to most accurately reproduce the experimental data s variation with model simulations the best result was achieved by drawing the parameter surface area specific maximum assimilation rate from a log normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0 15 or by drawing the maturity thresholds for birth and puberty assuming proportionality between the two from a log normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0 40 in both cases the model not only accurately reproduced the variation observed in development time data which had been used in the fitting process but also gave adequate predictions of the variation observed in brood size data which had not been used for fitting although the findings of this study apply to one species only the methods presented here are a proof of principle for how the question of intra specific variability in a deb model for any species can be addressed in a simple yet purposeful manner graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords copepod nitocra spinipes dynamic energy budget individual based variability life history parameter estimation 1 introduction no two organisms are alike even among individuals of the same species genetic and phenotypic differences exist while researchers often aim to link variations in observable traits to the fitness and the performance of individual organisms a growing body of research has focused on how inter individual variation affects the ecological success of a population as a whole agashe 2009 gamfeldt and källström 2007 gonzález suárez and revilla 2013 in a comprehensive review on this subject forsman and wennersten 2016 evaluated 45 experimental and comparative studies 42 of which found a positive relationship between inter individual variability and the ecological success of a population or species indicators of ecological success included lower vulnerability to environmental changes reduced population fluctuations higher colonization success larger geographic range distributions and lower risk of extinction furthermore multiple studies indicate that the population benefits of genetic and phenotypic variability were more prominent under more stressful conditions caesar et al 2010 ganz and ebert 2010 randall hughes and stachowicz 2011 despite the apparent importance of inter individual variability for the performance of a population it is often disregarded in mathematical population models such models are used to simulate the population dynamics of a species under conditions that are impracticable to set up experimentally in environmental decision making this can be helpful to assess untested and potentially harmful scenarios that may occur in the future e g due to chemical contamination or climatic changes a model type that is particularly suitable to incorporate inter individual variability is the individual based model ibm railsback and grimm 2019 compared to other population models ibms have the advantage to keep track of individual organisms each with its own set of parameters and state variables nevertheless realistically reproducing variation found in life history data of a species such as the size and age at maturation or the number of offspring per brood in an ibm is not always straightforward especially if one life history process is controlled by more than one model parameter or if conversely one model parameter influences several life history processes estimating the variability of each individual parameter from life history data can be intricate in ibms that employ the dynamic energy budget deb theory the life history trajectory of an organism depends on at least 12 physiological parameters within a set of fixed model equations that describe general rules of metabolic organization common to all organisms these parameters account for all species specific manifestations of life history processes such as food uptake growth development and reproduction kooijman 2010b given a set of experimental life history data for a species the software package debtool marques et al 2018 which implements the covariation method presented by lika et al 2011 can be used to estimate the optimal parameters to reproduce this species life history in a deb model however this optimal set of parameters only represents an average animal of the species and does not take into account inter individual variability in recent years many researchers from different disciplines have undergone training in deb theory and parameter estimation e g during the biannual deb tele courses symposia and thematic schools which has led to many new entries in the add my pet amp data collection 2033 entries as of april 15 2020 amp 2020 while for some entries data of multiple individual organisms were used to estimate a species deb parameters it is important to notice that all inter individual variation was simply treated as data uncertainty even though it is likely that at least part of this variation is attributed to actual biological variability within the species for applications of deb theory in which the average performance of an organism is the main focus this is no point of concern for deb based ibms however knowledge of how the physiological parameters vary among individuals of the same species is essential to realistically portray the variability within a population in model simulations based on suggestions by kooijman et al 1989 martin et al 2012 introduced variability in deb ibms by applying scatter to a single primary parameter namely the surface area specific maximum assimilation rate p a m and consequently all secondary parameters that depend on p a m the scatter was added via a random number log normally distributed around a mean value of 1 drawn for each animal individually and multiplied with the default p a m this method requires only one new model parameter i e the standard deviation of the log normal distribution and introduces inter individual variability in numerous life history traits simultaneously while we embrace this one parameter approach for its simplicity and practicability a sound rationale for why p a m and no other parameter instead should be subject to variation is currently lacking furthermore other probability distribution types apart from the log normal distribution could be considered lastly no clear recommendations were made for how narrow or broad the probability distribution should be or for how this information could potentially be derived from experimental data which has entailed the use of rule of thumb estimates such as 0 1 for the standard deviation of log p a m galic et al 2017 martin et al 2012 as a common practice in this study it was our aim to use experimental data on life history observables of the copepod nitocra spinipes reared under control conditions to make realistic estimates of the variability in deb parameter values for this species a thorough parameter estimation for n spinipes was recently performed in debtool koch and de schamphelaere 2019 a deb ibm for this copepod is currently under development in our group and is expected to strongly benefit from a realistic implementation of inter individual variability for the sake of model simplicity alike the approach chosen by martin et al 2012 we sought to add variability to only one i e the most suited parameter the goals of this study were a to identify the parameter that if sampled from a suitable probability distribution while keeping all other parameters constant would reproduce the variation observed in the experimental data with the highest accuracy b to determine the most appropriate probability distribution for this parameter to be sampled from and c to estimate the optimal scale parameter value for this probability distribution from the data 2 materials and methods 2 1 model organism and deb parameters as a model organism we selected the harpacticoid copepod n spinipes preferring mainly brackish environments this euryhaline bottom dweller can be found in different water bodies around the world lang 1948 as part of the meiofauna n spinipes serves as a trophic link between the microphytobenthos and higher organisms such as fish coull 1990 in the past this species has been used frequently in ecotoxicological studies and has become the subject of multiple standardized testing guidelines iso 1999 2016 oecd 2014 an empirical ibm for this species was firstly developed by preuss et al 2011 and was expanded by koch et al 2017 a deb model based on differential equations describing the life history of individuals specifically females more mechanistically while adhering to the law of conservation of energy was parametrized by koch and de schamphelaere 2019 in fact two slightly different models were parametrized each making different assumptions about the metabolic behavior of n spinipes the first model denoted sbp which stands for standard as in the standard deb model metabolic behavior from birth to puberty assumes the widely prevalent von bertalanffy growth pattern from birth until puberty whereas the model denoted abp assumes a metabolic acceleration see kooijman 2014 which has been found in some closely related species a defining property of both models is that unlike with the standard deb model the animal stops growing at puberty and subsequently all available energy that is not required for maintenance is invested in reproduction a full definition of the abp and sbp models for copepods can be found in the comments document for the deb book kooijman 2010a despite their intrinsic difference both models showed reasonable fits when parametrized individually to the same set of experimental data by koch and de schamphelaere 2019 therefore the methods presented in this study were applied to both models while in this manuscript we only report our work with the sbp model repeating the calculations with the abp model led to very similar results which can be found in the supplementary material the 12 primary deb parameters of the sbp model can be found in table 1 it should be noted that the parameters f m κx κr and k j were not estimated from experimental data by koch and de schamphelaere 2019 but instead were fixed at typical default values this approach is commonly used if the available data do not contain sufficient information to make reliable estimates for certain parameters marques et al 2018 moreover the surface area specific somatic maintenance rate p t was fixed at zero which is typically done for ectotherms kooijman 2010b 2 2 experimental data and model simulations for the assessment of variability of life history traits in n spinipes we made use of data from multiple life history experiments of very similar design that were carried out in the past dahl and breitholtz 2008 koch et al 2017 lundström et al 2010 oecd 2007 preuss et al 2011 data on two endpoints i e a the time from hatching until reaching the reproductive state hereafter referred to as development time sample size n 610 and b the number of offspring per brood of a reproducing female hereafter referred to as brood size n 606 were deemed fit for purpose since their sample sizes were considered large enough to provide insight into their respective distributions shape moreover both endpoints are closely linked to the population growth rate and are thus of high ecological relevance hansen et al 1999 all data on animals that had been exposed to chemical stressors were filtered out for this study while not all studies used the same food source food was always offered in abundance due to the relatively small size of the experimental setups in microwell plates high consistency in exposure temperatures among individuals from the same experiment could be ensured this gives us reason to believe that inter individual variation observed within each experiment was mainly caused by physiological differences among the animals instead of differences in their environment to account for minor temperature differences between the experiments all data were normalized this was done by dividing all data points by the mean of their respective data set and subsequently multiplying them by the average development time or brood size at optimal conditions of temperature 20 c and food functional response f 1 predicted by the model density histograms of the experimental data are presented in fig 1 in the present study all model simulations of the endpoints development time and brood size at different parameter values were done using the functions provided in the free software package debtool http www bio vu nl thb deb deblab since the deb model keeps track of the maturity energy eh i e the cumulative energy which has been invested by the organism to build up maturity over time the development time from birth e h e h b until puberty e h e h p is an endpoint that could be directly predicted by the deb model the reproduction rate r of a reproducing female was calculated via r κ r p r e 0 with the reproduction efficiency κr see table 1 the energy flux to reproduction p r which in the sbp type model at puberty equates to the assimilation flux p a minus the energy fluxes to somatic maintenance p s and maturity maintenance p j and the energy cost per egg e 0 consequently reproduction output was predicted as the number of offspring per day instead of offspring per brood therefore additional information about the timing per brood would be needed to properly link the model output to the experimental data since this information was missing for most of the brood size data we assumed a constant release time of 3 17 days per brood i e the average of all the available data unfortunately this assumption unavoidably led to more uncertainty when linking the model outputs to the data for this reason we decided not to include the brood size data when fitting parametric distributions to the data in subsection 2 4 but instead use it for preliminary model validation 2 3 parameter screening our objective was to identify individual model parameters that if drawn from an appropriate probability distribution while keeping all other parameters at their nominal values as in table 1 would produce variation in the model output that is a good approximation of the variation that was observed in the experimental data as the first step in the search for such a parameter a one at a time sensitivity analysis oat was performed in accordance with the experimental conditions the model simulations were executed under optimal conditions of temperature 20 c and food functional response f 1 each parameter from table 1 for the exceptions see below was moved stepwise from extremely low to extremely high values while the produced model outputs for development time and brood size were recorded in each step extreme parameter values here are defined as a parameter boundaries such as 0 and 1 for ratio parameters b values around which the model outputs converged toward stable values or c parameter values below or above which simulations failed due to unrealistic parameter combinations for each parameter that was moved between its extreme values the range of model output data on development time and brood size was then compared to the experimental data only if the range of model output data encompassed the 5th and 95th percentile of the experimental data a parameter was considered a plausible candidate to explain the variation observed in the experimental data in the case of the parameters e h b and e h p which are the maturity thresholds for birth and puberty respectively we supposed proportionality these parameters indicate how much cumulative energy needs to be invested by the organism in maturity before birth i e the moment the organism starts feeding and later on puberty is reached inter individual variations in these two parameters may be explained by differences in how efficiently organisms can use energy for maturation we assumed that individuals that require above average energy investment in maturity to reach birth also need more energy to reach puberty therefore these two parameters were not moved individually but instead were multiplied by a newly introduced factor x e h which in turn was moved from low to high values around a default of 1 in further analyses x e h itself instead of e h b and e h p individually was treated as a potentially variable deb parameter recent studies have suggested that multiple deb parameters may covary among individuals of the same species following the same general rules that govern covariation in mean parameter values among different species stavrakidis zachou et al 2019 these inter specific rules also referred to as body size scaling relationships have been discussed in great detail in the past kooijman 2010b carrying over these rules from the inter species to the intra species level implies that when p a m is modified relative to its default value by a factor ζ both e h b and e h p must be multiplied by ζ 3 notably this approach also assumes proportionality between e h b and e h p to further explore this idea we also included ζ which modifies p a m e h b and e h p simultaneously in our parameter screening furthermore some parameters were excluded from the parameter screening firstly the specific searching rate f m which is used to calculate the animal s feeding rate as a function of food density was excluded since high food concentrations were present in all experiments and a functional response of f 1 was assumed for all simulations strictly speaking despite being defined as a primary deb parameter the maximum assimilation rate p a m is the product of the maximum ingestion rate p x m not a primary parameter and the assimilation efficiency κx hence potential variability in κx is also contained in p a m since the data used in this study did not allow to differentiate between variability in p x m versus κx as the source for variability in p a m κx was excluded from the screening likewise the reproduction efficiency κr was excluded since it does not affect any processes other than reproduction lastly the surface area specific somatic maintenance rate p t which is typically zero for ectotherms kooijman 2010b was also excluded from the parameter screening 2 4 fitting parametric distributions as a next step we aimed to find an appropriate parametric probability distribution for each of the parameter candidates which passed the screening to be sampled from we used the curves generated in the oat fig 2 to deduce the exact values of each parameter candidate that would be needed to replicate the experimental data on development time one by one in model simulations the thus obtained parameter distributions were then analyzed by means of skewness kurtosis plots cullen and frey 1999 descdist function in r package fitdistrplus such plots make use of an empirical distribution s skewness and kurtosis as two shape defining properties to investigate its similarity to commonly used parametric distributions the idea behind this is that the closer the distance between the empirical distribution and a parametric one in a plot of kurtosis versus squared skewness the better the fit that can be expected the most plausible parametric distributions were then fitted to the data by means of the fitdist function in the same r package lastly akaike information criteria aic were used to identify the most suited parametric distribution for each parameter 2 5 model implementation and validation in this final step variability was added to the deb model for n spinipes by for each new simulation drawing one particular model parameter from its optimal probability distribution and keeping all other parameters fixed this procedure was implemented separately for all parameters that had passed the parameter screening in section 2 3 to test the different implementations for each one 105 life history simulations were executed while development time and brood size were recorded as endpoints the thus obtained distributions of both endpoints were then compared to the experimental data distributions in consideration of their shape and scale as the development time data had been used to fit the parameter distributions a comparison of simulations versus the experimental data should only serve as a sanity check for the fitting method the brood sizes in contrast had not been included in the fitting process and were used as an independent data set to validate the model 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameter screening the results of the parameter screening are presented in fig 2 besides the simulation data from each parameter in the oat the figure shows the range of experimental data full range as well as 5th and 95th percentiles overlaps are shaded in light blue whereas discrepancies are shaded in pink it can be seen that p a m and x e h were the only parameters that if varied while keeping all other parameters constant could reproduce the 5th 95th percentile range of measured data on both development time and brood size although changes in eg could explain the range of measured development times they could not explain the range of brood sizes by contrast varying p m led to the observed brood sizes but the lower 5 of development time data could not be reached by changes in this parameter alone all other parameters failed to reproduce short development times and high brood sizes even if changed individually to extremely low or high parameter values this also includes the factor ζ which modifies p a m e h b and e h p simultaneously following the principle of body size scaling relationships therefore we conclude that despite its applicability on the inter species level this principle is not suitable to explain all variation observed on the intra species level ultimately only p a m and x e h were left as parameters to move forward with 3 2 fitting parametric distributions hypothetical distributions of the parameters p a m and x e h that with all other parameters fixed would be needed to accurately replicate the experimental development time data are presented in fig 3 both distributions are presented as points in a plot of kurtosis versus squared skewness to illustrate their proximity to commonly used parametric probability distributions which depending on the shapes they can take are displayed as points lines or areas the distribution of x e h is distinctly skewed and may presumably be approximated by distributions that allow for asymmetry such as the log normal the gamma the exponential and the beta distribution the latter however is confined to the range 0 1 and therefore was excluded the distribution of p a m is much less skewed and may also be approximated by symmetric distributions such as the normal and the logistic distribution an overview of all conducted distributions fits with goodness of fit criteria can be found in the supplementary material for both distributions a log normal distribution was found to give the best fit closely followed by the gamma distribution we consider both these theoretical distributions appropriate approximations of the parameter distributions of p a m and x e h for this study we decided to proceed with the log normal distribution due to its slightly better fit whereas both parameters distributions could be approximated by the same theoretical distributions the distributions scale parameters were found to be distinctly different with a standard deviation of 0 40 the scale of x e h s log normal distribution is wider than that of p a m s d 0 15 meaning that larger relative changes in x e h are needed to produce the same changes in the model output at this point we can not make any judgment about what variability in each respective parameter is biologically reasonable or not additional case studies on variability in deb parameters which consider multiple species and endpoints should be performed in the future to develop a broader understanding of this matter 3 3 model implementation and validation results of 105 repeated model simulations with the best fitting parameter distributions of p a m and x e h respectively are presented in fig 4 histograms of the experimental data same as in fig 1 are shown for comparison notably regardless of whether p a m or x e h was subject to variation the simulation results for the considered observables were virtually identical a closer inspection revealed close to perfect linearity r 2 0 998 between the natural logarithm of the values of p a m and x e h that lead to the same output in development time within the range of realistic i e experimentally measured values hence drawing both parameters from log normal distributions fitted to the same data could be expected to deliver equivalent results in the model outputs for this endpoint the fact that the same phenomenon also appears to be true for the brood sizes points towards a close mechanistic link between the two endpoints in the model structure for further elaborations see section 3 4 the distributions of simulated development times correspond well with the distribution of the experimental data both in terms of shape and scale while development times of 15 17 and 18 days were slightly less frequent in relation to the full sample in model simulations versus the experimental data development times of 16 21 and 22 days occurred slightly more often this can likely be explained by the limited sample size of the experimental data as we would expect a more smooth density distribution at a higher n the overall convincing fit of simulated versus experimental data for this endpoint could be expected since the parameter distributions had been fitted although indirectly to the data next when looking at brood size the simulated data again correspond fairly well with the experimental data in terms of their spread the model however failed to reproduce the left sided skewness of the experimental data by sampling either of the parameters p a m or x e h from a log normal distribution the produced model output for brood size suggests to follow a distribution similar to the log normal which is likewise right skewed it can be noted that the experimental data do not follow a perfectly smooth distribution but instead have a little hump at particularly small brood sizes between 1 and 6 from the curvilinear relationships of individually varied parameters versus the model outputs in the oat fig 2 it could be expected that this unevenness in the brood size histogram could not be reproduced by varying only one single physiological parameter with a two parameter probability distribution the data suggest that more than one process may have an effect on the brood size and this cannot be fully explained by variation in one physiological parameter alone however it must also be noted that the experimental data to an unknown degree suffer from multiple sources of uncertainty such as non ideal experimental setups handling of the test animals data collection and data normalization furthermore as stated above the model presumed a constant brood release rate which was independent of any parameter variations it can be speculated that in reality the release rate is positively or negatively correlated with the brood size good quality data on this are currently lacking considering the uncertainties in both the experimental data and the model output we find the overall match of the two satisfactory the realistic coverage of variability in both the development time until the onset of reproduction and the reproductive output per female makes the deb model very useful as a component in an individual based population model since the two are fundamental drivers of population growth hansen et al 1999 data on other life history observables of n spinipes may be collected in the future to further validate the model and more specifically its implementation of inter individual variability in different life history traits having access to more data however may also lead to a case in which not all variation observed in different endpoints can be explained well by variability in one parameter alone since deb parameter values emerge from complex physiological systems which for a large part may be variable among individuals it seems natural that in an ideal model more than one of these parameters should be subject to some degree of variation this hypothesis is supported by the fact that various deb parameters also differ widely among different species in the animal kingdom whereas others appear to be more universally consistent lika et al 2011 from an evolutionary perspective inter individual variability of multiple deb parameters within a species is a fundamental requirement for new species with different deb parameters to emerge that being said depending on the scientific question that a model aims to answer reducing the variability to just one parameter may be an appropriate simplification of reality 3 4 parameter considerations although one goal of this study was to identify a single i e the most suitable parameter that should be varied to produce realistic variation in the model outputs ultimately the two parameters p a m and x e h were found to be equally suitable the explanation for this can be found in the model structure an increase in the maximum assimilation rate p a m which goes along with a higher energy uptake leads to higher energy investment in maturity and consequently an earlier achievement of the maturity threshold for puberty after puberty more energy is available for reproduction which leads to the production of more offspring the same result can be achieved by lowering x e h which translates to lowering both the maturity thresholds for birth e h b and puberty e h p by the same proportion in this scenario less energy is needed to reach the maturity thresholds which again leads to faster maturation a lower e h b leads to lower energetic costs per produced egg and again leads to the production of more offspring the opposite is the case if p a m is decreased or x e h is increased interestingly the just described results of increasing p a m or decreasing x e h or vice versa are not only equivalent in terms of quality but also approximately in terms of quantity a positive change in p a m and a negative change in x e h that would each lead to the same reduction in development time would also each lead to the almost exact same increase in brood size this relationship appears to be a special property of the typified copepod models abp and sbp in which growth ends at puberty and does not hold true e g for the standard deb model although at this point it may seem irrelevant for the model outputs whether p a m or x e h is subject to variability the situation changes if we take other endpoints into consideration if for example we consider the body size at puberty as an additional model output we find that an increase in p a m leads to a larger body size whereas a decrease in x e h leads to a smaller one despite the similar development time and brood size per female this may have important ecological implications when considering factors such as food competition as larger animals consume more food and size selective predation which should be further explored in future simulation studies overall variation in either p a m or x e h appears ecologically meaningful since they both promote the desynchronization of a population in terms of its life stages which in turn makes it less vulnerable to environmental stress and catastrophic mortality events that affect only specific fractions of the population ohlberger and langangen 2015 additional experimental work investigating correlations between either the development time or brood size on the one hand and the body size at puberty on the other hand could inform the prioritization of one parameter over the other when it comes to the implementation of variability in the model for now we prefer the use of p a m as an individually variable parameter over x e h since using x e h as a surrogate parameter for e h b and e h p is slightly more cumbersome furthermore it is based on the untested model assumption that e h b and e h p covary proportionally among individuals which should be further explored in the future 3 5 extrapolation to other species a striking convenience of the deb theory is that it is highly generic in the sense that virtually any species life history can be reproduced by the same model or slightly modified derivates thereof kooijman 2010a the differences between two species are primarily explained by differences in their parameter values dealing with intra specific variability of deb parameters raises the question if it is transferrable from one species to another it can be assumed that individuals of closely related species vary in the same parameters the extent to which parameters vary may however be highly heterogeneous and likely depends on a species ecology furthermore the role and interpretation of a deb parameter can be slightly different when comparing e g the standard deb model to a model derivate such as abp or sbp nonetheless it can be noted that the optimal approach found in this study i e varying p a m with a log normal distribution coincides with the approach chosen in earlier studies galic et al 2017 martin et al 2012 we therefore assume that the existing approach although to our knowledge not based on real observations but rather implemented as a pragmatic solution may in fact be quite accurate at 0 15 the ideal standard deviation of log p a m calibrated in this study was slightly higher than the commonly applied default of 0 1 but again we expect this value to differ on a species to species base this is also why we advise against one to one extrapolations of our results to other species unless this can be supported with experimental data nevertheless the methods presented in this study may certainly be applied to other species for which similar data exist this study should first and foremost be seen as a proof of principle for how the very complex question of intra specific variability in a deb model can be addressed in a simple and straightforward manner 4 conclusions in this study we presented a novel approach for how the inter individual variability of deb model parameters can be estimated from experimental data using the copepod n spinipes as a model species the initial choice to add variability to only one model parameter while keeping all others at their default greatly facilitated dealing with this otherwise very complex task yet the one parameter approach delivered satisfactory results by recycling experimental data from previous studies we were able to find the most plausible parameters that may be subject to variability to identify suitable parametric probability distributions and to fit those distributions to the data in the end two parameters were found to be equally suitable to reproduce the variability observed in the experimental data additional data in the future may tell which of the two parameters is the most biologically plausible the variability of two life history traits that are closely related to population growth was predicted well by the model supporting its potential use in ibms although we advise against extrapolating the results of this study to other deb organisms one to one we hope that the methods established in this study inspire other researchers to carry out similar studies with different species credit authorship contribution statement josef

24786,the degree of biological variability within a population is an important factor for its ecological success yet individual based population models ibms that utilize the dynamic energy budget deb theory as a mechanistic basis to simulate an individual s life history largely rely on rule of thumb estimates of inter individual variability of their parameter values in this study we explored how data from previous life history experiments with the copepod nitocra spinipes could be used to make realistic estimates of variability in deb parameter values for this species we specifically investigated to which one of 12 possible parameters variability should be added and what shape and scale its probability distribution should have to most accurately reproduce the experimental data s variation with model simulations the best result was achieved by drawing the parameter surface area specific maximum assimilation rate from a log normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0 15 or by drawing the maturity thresholds for birth and puberty assuming proportionality between the two from a log normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0 40 in both cases the model not only accurately reproduced the variation observed in development time data which had been used in the fitting process but also gave adequate predictions of the variation observed in brood size data which had not been used for fitting although the findings of this study apply to one species only the methods presented here are a proof of principle for how the question of intra specific variability in a deb model for any species can be addressed in a simple yet purposeful manner graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords copepod nitocra spinipes dynamic energy budget individual based variability life history parameter estimation 1 introduction no two organisms are alike even among individuals of the same species genetic and phenotypic differences exist while researchers often aim to link variations in observable traits to the fitness and the performance of individual organisms a growing body of research has focused on how inter individual variation affects the ecological success of a population as a whole agashe 2009 gamfeldt and källström 2007 gonzález suárez and revilla 2013 in a comprehensive review on this subject forsman and wennersten 2016 evaluated 45 experimental and comparative studies 42 of which found a positive relationship between inter individual variability and the ecological success of a population or species indicators of ecological success included lower vulnerability to environmental changes reduced population fluctuations higher colonization success larger geographic range distributions and lower risk of extinction furthermore multiple studies indicate that the population benefits of genetic and phenotypic variability were more prominent under more stressful conditions caesar et al 2010 ganz and ebert 2010 randall hughes and stachowicz 2011 despite the apparent importance of inter individual variability for the performance of a population it is often disregarded in mathematical population models such models are used to simulate the population dynamics of a species under conditions that are impracticable to set up experimentally in environmental decision making this can be helpful to assess untested and potentially harmful scenarios that may occur in the future e g due to chemical contamination or climatic changes a model type that is particularly suitable to incorporate inter individual variability is the individual based model ibm railsback and grimm 2019 compared to other population models ibms have the advantage to keep track of individual organisms each with its own set of parameters and state variables nevertheless realistically reproducing variation found in life history data of a species such as the size and age at maturation or the number of offspring per brood in an ibm is not always straightforward especially if one life history process is controlled by more than one model parameter or if conversely one model parameter influences several life history processes estimating the variability of each individual parameter from life history data can be intricate in ibms that employ the dynamic energy budget deb theory the life history trajectory of an organism depends on at least 12 physiological parameters within a set of fixed model equations that describe general rules of metabolic organization common to all organisms these parameters account for all species specific manifestations of life history processes such as food uptake growth development and reproduction kooijman 2010b given a set of experimental life history data for a species the software package debtool marques et al 2018 which implements the covariation method presented by lika et al 2011 can be used to estimate the optimal parameters to reproduce this species life history in a deb model however this optimal set of parameters only represents an average animal of the species and does not take into account inter individual variability in recent years many researchers from different disciplines have undergone training in deb theory and parameter estimation e g during the biannual deb tele courses symposia and thematic schools which has led to many new entries in the add my pet amp data collection 2033 entries as of april 15 2020 amp 2020 while for some entries data of multiple individual organisms were used to estimate a species deb parameters it is important to notice that all inter individual variation was simply treated as data uncertainty even though it is likely that at least part of this variation is attributed to actual biological variability within the species for applications of deb theory in which the average performance of an organism is the main focus this is no point of concern for deb based ibms however knowledge of how the physiological parameters vary among individuals of the same species is essential to realistically portray the variability within a population in model simulations based on suggestions by kooijman et al 1989 martin et al 2012 introduced variability in deb ibms by applying scatter to a single primary parameter namely the surface area specific maximum assimilation rate p a m and consequently all secondary parameters that depend on p a m the scatter was added via a random number log normally distributed around a mean value of 1 drawn for each animal individually and multiplied with the default p a m this method requires only one new model parameter i e the standard deviation of the log normal distribution and introduces inter individual variability in numerous life history traits simultaneously while we embrace this one parameter approach for its simplicity and practicability a sound rationale for why p a m and no other parameter instead should be subject to variation is currently lacking furthermore other probability distribution types apart from the log normal distribution could be considered lastly no clear recommendations were made for how narrow or broad the probability distribution should be or for how this information could potentially be derived from experimental data which has entailed the use of rule of thumb estimates such as 0 1 for the standard deviation of log p a m galic et al 2017 martin et al 2012 as a common practice in this study it was our aim to use experimental data on life history observables of the copepod nitocra spinipes reared under control conditions to make realistic estimates of the variability in deb parameter values for this species a thorough parameter estimation for n spinipes was recently performed in debtool koch and de schamphelaere 2019 a deb ibm for this copepod is currently under development in our group and is expected to strongly benefit from a realistic implementation of inter individual variability for the sake of model simplicity alike the approach chosen by martin et al 2012 we sought to add variability to only one i e the most suited parameter the goals of this study were a to identify the parameter that if sampled from a suitable probability distribution while keeping all other parameters constant would reproduce the variation observed in the experimental data with the highest accuracy b to determine the most appropriate probability distribution for this parameter to be sampled from and c to estimate the optimal scale parameter value for this probability distribution from the data 2 materials and methods 2 1 model organism and deb parameters as a model organism we selected the harpacticoid copepod n spinipes preferring mainly brackish environments this euryhaline bottom dweller can be found in different water bodies around the world lang 1948 as part of the meiofauna n spinipes serves as a trophic link between the microphytobenthos and higher organisms such as fish coull 1990 in the past this species has been used frequently in ecotoxicological studies and has become the subject of multiple standardized testing guidelines iso 1999 2016 oecd 2014 an empirical ibm for this species was firstly developed by preuss et al 2011 and was expanded by koch et al 2017 a deb model based on differential equations describing the life history of individuals specifically females more mechanistically while adhering to the law of conservation of energy was parametrized by koch and de schamphelaere 2019 in fact two slightly different models were parametrized each making different assumptions about the metabolic behavior of n spinipes the first model denoted sbp which stands for standard as in the standard deb model metabolic behavior from birth to puberty assumes the widely prevalent von bertalanffy growth pattern from birth until puberty whereas the model denoted abp assumes a metabolic acceleration see kooijman 2014 which has been found in some closely related species a defining property of both models is that unlike with the standard deb model the animal stops growing at puberty and subsequently all available energy that is not required for maintenance is invested in reproduction a full definition of the abp and sbp models for copepods can be found in the comments document for the deb book kooijman 2010a despite their intrinsic difference both models showed reasonable fits when parametrized individually to the same set of experimental data by koch and de schamphelaere 2019 therefore the methods presented in this study were applied to both models while in this manuscript we only report our work with the sbp model repeating the calculations with the abp model led to very similar results which can be found in the supplementary material the 12 primary deb parameters of the sbp model can be found in table 1 it should be noted that the parameters f m κx κr and k j were not estimated from experimental data by koch and de schamphelaere 2019 but instead were fixed at typical default values this approach is commonly used if the available data do not contain sufficient information to make reliable estimates for certain parameters marques et al 2018 moreover the surface area specific somatic maintenance rate p t was fixed at zero which is typically done for ectotherms kooijman 2010b 2 2 experimental data and model simulations for the assessment of variability of life history traits in n spinipes we made use of data from multiple life history experiments of very similar design that were carried out in the past dahl and breitholtz 2008 koch et al 2017 lundström et al 2010 oecd 2007 preuss et al 2011 data on two endpoints i e a the time from hatching until reaching the reproductive state hereafter referred to as development time sample size n 610 and b the number of offspring per brood of a reproducing female hereafter referred to as brood size n 606 were deemed fit for purpose since their sample sizes were considered large enough to provide insight into their respective distributions shape moreover both endpoints are closely linked to the population growth rate and are thus of high ecological relevance hansen et al 1999 all data on animals that had been exposed to chemical stressors were filtered out for this study while not all studies used the same food source food was always offered in abundance due to the relatively small size of the experimental setups in microwell plates high consistency in exposure temperatures among individuals from the same experiment could be ensured this gives us reason to believe that inter individual variation observed within each experiment was mainly caused by physiological differences among the animals instead of differences in their environment to account for minor temperature differences between the experiments all data were normalized this was done by dividing all data points by the mean of their respective data set and subsequently multiplying them by the average development time or brood size at optimal conditions of temperature 20 c and food functional response f 1 predicted by the model density histograms of the experimental data are presented in fig 1 in the present study all model simulations of the endpoints development time and brood size at different parameter values were done using the functions provided in the free software package debtool http www bio vu nl thb deb deblab since the deb model keeps track of the maturity energy eh i e the cumulative energy which has been invested by the organism to build up maturity over time the development time from birth e h e h b until puberty e h e h p is an endpoint that could be directly predicted by the deb model the reproduction rate r of a reproducing female was calculated via r κ r p r e 0 with the reproduction efficiency κr see table 1 the energy flux to reproduction p r which in the sbp type model at puberty equates to the assimilation flux p a minus the energy fluxes to somatic maintenance p s and maturity maintenance p j and the energy cost per egg e 0 consequently reproduction output was predicted as the number of offspring per day instead of offspring per brood therefore additional information about the timing per brood would be needed to properly link the model output to the experimental data since this information was missing for most of the brood size data we assumed a constant release time of 3 17 days per brood i e the average of all the available data unfortunately this assumption unavoidably led to more uncertainty when linking the model outputs to the data for this reason we decided not to include the brood size data when fitting parametric distributions to the data in subsection 2 4 but instead use it for preliminary model validation 2 3 parameter screening our objective was to identify individual model parameters that if drawn from an appropriate probability distribution while keeping all other parameters at their nominal values as in table 1 would produce variation in the model output that is a good approximation of the variation that was observed in the experimental data as the first step in the search for such a parameter a one at a time sensitivity analysis oat was performed in accordance with the experimental conditions the model simulations were executed under optimal conditions of temperature 20 c and food functional response f 1 each parameter from table 1 for the exceptions see below was moved stepwise from extremely low to extremely high values while the produced model outputs for development time and brood size were recorded in each step extreme parameter values here are defined as a parameter boundaries such as 0 and 1 for ratio parameters b values around which the model outputs converged toward stable values or c parameter values below or above which simulations failed due to unrealistic parameter combinations for each parameter that was moved between its extreme values the range of model output data on development time and brood size was then compared to the experimental data only if the range of model output data encompassed the 5th and 95th percentile of the experimental data a parameter was considered a plausible candidate to explain the variation observed in the experimental data in the case of the parameters e h b and e h p which are the maturity thresholds for birth and puberty respectively we supposed proportionality these parameters indicate how much cumulative energy needs to be invested by the organism in maturity before birth i e the moment the organism starts feeding and later on puberty is reached inter individual variations in these two parameters may be explained by differences in how efficiently organisms can use energy for maturation we assumed that individuals that require above average energy investment in maturity to reach birth also need more energy to reach puberty therefore these two parameters were not moved individually but instead were multiplied by a newly introduced factor x e h which in turn was moved from low to high values around a default of 1 in further analyses x e h itself instead of e h b and e h p individually was treated as a potentially variable deb parameter recent studies have suggested that multiple deb parameters may covary among individuals of the same species following the same general rules that govern covariation in mean parameter values among different species stavrakidis zachou et al 2019 these inter specific rules also referred to as body size scaling relationships have been discussed in great detail in the past kooijman 2010b carrying over these rules from the inter species to the intra species level implies that when p a m is modified relative to its default value by a factor ζ both e h b and e h p must be multiplied by ζ 3 notably this approach also assumes proportionality between e h b and e h p to further explore this idea we also included ζ which modifies p a m e h b and e h p simultaneously in our parameter screening furthermore some parameters were excluded from the parameter screening firstly the specific searching rate f m which is used to calculate the animal s feeding rate as a function of food density was excluded since high food concentrations were present in all experiments and a functional response of f 1 was assumed for all simulations strictly speaking despite being defined as a primary deb parameter the maximum assimilation rate p a m is the product of the maximum ingestion rate p x m not a primary parameter and the assimilation efficiency κx hence potential variability in κx is also contained in p a m since the data used in this study did not allow to differentiate between variability in p x m versus κx as the source for variability in p a m κx was excluded from the screening likewise the reproduction efficiency κr was excluded since it does not affect any processes other than reproduction lastly the surface area specific somatic maintenance rate p t which is typically zero for ectotherms kooijman 2010b was also excluded from the parameter screening 2 4 fitting parametric distributions as a next step we aimed to find an appropriate parametric probability distribution for each of the parameter candidates which passed the screening to be sampled from we used the curves generated in the oat fig 2 to deduce the exact values of each parameter candidate that would be needed to replicate the experimental data on development time one by one in model simulations the thus obtained parameter distributions were then analyzed by means of skewness kurtosis plots cullen and frey 1999 descdist function in r package fitdistrplus such plots make use of an empirical distribution s skewness and kurtosis as two shape defining properties to investigate its similarity to commonly used parametric distributions the idea behind this is that the closer the distance between the empirical distribution and a parametric one in a plot of kurtosis versus squared skewness the better the fit that can be expected the most plausible parametric distributions were then fitted to the data by means of the fitdist function in the same r package lastly akaike information criteria aic were used to identify the most suited parametric distribution for each parameter 2 5 model implementation and validation in this final step variability was added to the deb model for n spinipes by for each new simulation drawing one particular model parameter from its optimal probability distribution and keeping all other parameters fixed this procedure was implemented separately for all parameters that had passed the parameter screening in section 2 3 to test the different implementations for each one 105 life history simulations were executed while development time and brood size were recorded as endpoints the thus obtained distributions of both endpoints were then compared to the experimental data distributions in consideration of their shape and scale as the development time data had been used to fit the parameter distributions a comparison of simulations versus the experimental data should only serve as a sanity check for the fitting method the brood sizes in contrast had not been included in the fitting process and were used as an independent data set to validate the model 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameter screening the results of the parameter screening are presented in fig 2 besides the simulation data from each parameter in the oat the figure shows the range of experimental data full range as well as 5th and 95th percentiles overlaps are shaded in light blue whereas discrepancies are shaded in pink it can be seen that p a m and x e h were the only parameters that if varied while keeping all other parameters constant could reproduce the 5th 95th percentile range of measured data on both development time and brood size although changes in eg could explain the range of measured development times they could not explain the range of brood sizes by contrast varying p m led to the observed brood sizes but the lower 5 of development time data could not be reached by changes in this parameter alone all other parameters failed to reproduce short development times and high brood sizes even if changed individually to extremely low or high parameter values this also includes the factor ζ which modifies p a m e h b and e h p simultaneously following the principle of body size scaling relationships therefore we conclude that despite its applicability on the inter species level this principle is not suitable to explain all variation observed on the intra species level ultimately only p a m and x e h were left as parameters to move forward with 3 2 fitting parametric distributions hypothetical distributions of the parameters p a m and x e h that with all other parameters fixed would be needed to accurately replicate the experimental development time data are presented in fig 3 both distributions are presented as points in a plot of kurtosis versus squared skewness to illustrate their proximity to commonly used parametric probability distributions which depending on the shapes they can take are displayed as points lines or areas the distribution of x e h is distinctly skewed and may presumably be approximated by distributions that allow for asymmetry such as the log normal the gamma the exponential and the beta distribution the latter however is confined to the range 0 1 and therefore was excluded the distribution of p a m is much less skewed and may also be approximated by symmetric distributions such as the normal and the logistic distribution an overview of all conducted distributions fits with goodness of fit criteria can be found in the supplementary material for both distributions a log normal distribution was found to give the best fit closely followed by the gamma distribution we consider both these theoretical distributions appropriate approximations of the parameter distributions of p a m and x e h for this study we decided to proceed with the log normal distribution due to its slightly better fit whereas both parameters distributions could be approximated by the same theoretical distributions the distributions scale parameters were found to be distinctly different with a standard deviation of 0 40 the scale of x e h s log normal distribution is wider than that of p a m s d 0 15 meaning that larger relative changes in x e h are needed to produce the same changes in the model output at this point we can not make any judgment about what variability in each respective parameter is biologically reasonable or not additional case studies on variability in deb parameters which consider multiple species and endpoints should be performed in the future to develop a broader understanding of this matter 3 3 model implementation and validation results of 105 repeated model simulations with the best fitting parameter distributions of p a m and x e h respectively are presented in fig 4 histograms of the experimental data same as in fig 1 are shown for comparison notably regardless of whether p a m or x e h was subject to variation the simulation results for the considered observables were virtually identical a closer inspection revealed close to perfect linearity r 2 0 998 between the natural logarithm of the values of p a m and x e h that lead to the same output in development time within the range of realistic i e experimentally measured values hence drawing both parameters from log normal distributions fitted to the same data could be expected to deliver equivalent results in the model outputs for this endpoint the fact that the same phenomenon also appears to be true for the brood sizes points towards a close mechanistic link between the two endpoints in the model structure for further elaborations see section 3 4 the distributions of simulated development times correspond well with the distribution of the experimental data both in terms of shape and scale while development times of 15 17 and 18 days were slightly less frequent in relation to the full sample in model simulations versus the experimental data development times of 16 21 and 22 days occurred slightly more often this can likely be explained by the limited sample size of the experimental data as we would expect a more smooth density distribution at a higher n the overall convincing fit of simulated versus experimental data for this endpoint could be expected since the parameter distributions had been fitted although indirectly to the data next when looking at brood size the simulated data again correspond fairly well with the experimental data in terms of their spread the model however failed to reproduce the left sided skewness of the experimental data by sampling either of the parameters p a m or x e h from a log normal distribution the produced model output for brood size suggests to follow a distribution similar to the log normal which is likewise right skewed it can be noted that the experimental data do not follow a perfectly smooth distribution but instead have a little hump at particularly small brood sizes between 1 and 6 from the curvilinear relationships of individually varied parameters versus the model outputs in the oat fig 2 it could be expected that this unevenness in the brood size histogram could not be reproduced by varying only one single physiological parameter with a two parameter probability distribution the data suggest that more than one process may have an effect on the brood size and this cannot be fully explained by variation in one physiological parameter alone however it must also be noted that the experimental data to an unknown degree suffer from multiple sources of uncertainty such as non ideal experimental setups handling of the test animals data collection and data normalization furthermore as stated above the model presumed a constant brood release rate which was independent of any parameter variations it can be speculated that in reality the release rate is positively or negatively correlated with the brood size good quality data on this are currently lacking considering the uncertainties in both the experimental data and the model output we find the overall match of the two satisfactory the realistic coverage of variability in both the development time until the onset of reproduction and the reproductive output per female makes the deb model very useful as a component in an individual based population model since the two are fundamental drivers of population growth hansen et al 1999 data on other life history observables of n spinipes may be collected in the future to further validate the model and more specifically its implementation of inter individual variability in different life history traits having access to more data however may also lead to a case in which not all variation observed in different endpoints can be explained well by variability in one parameter alone since deb parameter values emerge from complex physiological systems which for a large part may be variable among individuals it seems natural that in an ideal model more than one of these parameters should be subject to some degree of variation this hypothesis is supported by the fact that various deb parameters also differ widely among different species in the animal kingdom whereas others appear to be more universally consistent lika et al 2011 from an evolutionary perspective inter individual variability of multiple deb parameters within a species is a fundamental requirement for new species with different deb parameters to emerge that being said depending on the scientific question that a model aims to answer reducing the variability to just one parameter may be an appropriate simplification of reality 3 4 parameter considerations although one goal of this study was to identify a single i e the most suitable parameter that should be varied to produce realistic variation in the model outputs ultimately the two parameters p a m and x e h were found to be equally suitable the explanation for this can be found in the model structure an increase in the maximum assimilation rate p a m which goes along with a higher energy uptake leads to higher energy investment in maturity and consequently an earlier achievement of the maturity threshold for puberty after puberty more energy is available for reproduction which leads to the production of more offspring the same result can be achieved by lowering x e h which translates to lowering both the maturity thresholds for birth e h b and puberty e h p by the same proportion in this scenario less energy is needed to reach the maturity thresholds which again leads to faster maturation a lower e h b leads to lower energetic costs per produced egg and again leads to the production of more offspring the opposite is the case if p a m is decreased or x e h is increased interestingly the just described results of increasing p a m or decreasing x e h or vice versa are not only equivalent in terms of quality but also approximately in terms of quantity a positive change in p a m and a negative change in x e h that would each lead to the same reduction in development time would also each lead to the almost exact same increase in brood size this relationship appears to be a special property of the typified copepod models abp and sbp in which growth ends at puberty and does not hold true e g for the standard deb model although at this point it may seem irrelevant for the model outputs whether p a m or x e h is subject to variability the situation changes if we take other endpoints into consideration if for example we consider the body size at puberty as an additional model output we find that an increase in p a m leads to a larger body size whereas a decrease in x e h leads to a smaller one despite the similar development time and brood size per female this may have important ecological implications when considering factors such as food competition as larger animals consume more food and size selective predation which should be further explored in future simulation studies overall variation in either p a m or x e h appears ecologically meaningful since they both promote the desynchronization of a population in terms of its life stages which in turn makes it less vulnerable to environmental stress and catastrophic mortality events that affect only specific fractions of the population ohlberger and langangen 2015 additional experimental work investigating correlations between either the development time or brood size on the one hand and the body size at puberty on the other hand could inform the prioritization of one parameter over the other when it comes to the implementation of variability in the model for now we prefer the use of p a m as an individually variable parameter over x e h since using x e h as a surrogate parameter for e h b and e h p is slightly more cumbersome furthermore it is based on the untested model assumption that e h b and e h p covary proportionally among individuals which should be further explored in the future 3 5 extrapolation to other species a striking convenience of the deb theory is that it is highly generic in the sense that virtually any species life history can be reproduced by the same model or slightly modified derivates thereof kooijman 2010a the differences between two species are primarily explained by differences in their parameter values dealing with intra specific variability of deb parameters raises the question if it is transferrable from one species to another it can be assumed that individuals of closely related species vary in the same parameters the extent to which parameters vary may however be highly heterogeneous and likely depends on a species ecology furthermore the role and interpretation of a deb parameter can be slightly different when comparing e g the standard deb model to a model derivate such as abp or sbp nonetheless it can be noted that the optimal approach found in this study i e varying p a m with a log normal distribution coincides with the approach chosen in earlier studies galic et al 2017 martin et al 2012 we therefore assume that the existing approach although to our knowledge not based on real observations but rather implemented as a pragmatic solution may in fact be quite accurate at 0 15 the ideal standard deviation of log p a m calibrated in this study was slightly higher than the commonly applied default of 0 1 but again we expect this value to differ on a species to species base this is also why we advise against one to one extrapolations of our results to other species unless this can be supported with experimental data nevertheless the methods presented in this study may certainly be applied to other species for which similar data exist this study should first and foremost be seen as a proof of principle for how the very complex question of intra specific variability in a deb model can be addressed in a simple and straightforward manner 4 conclusions in this study we presented a novel approach for how the inter individual variability of deb model parameters can be estimated from experimental data using the copepod n spinipes as a model species the initial choice to add variability to only one model parameter while keeping all others at their default greatly facilitated dealing with this otherwise very complex task yet the one parameter approach delivered satisfactory results by recycling experimental data from previous studies we were able to find the most plausible parameters that may be subject to variability to identify suitable parametric probability distributions and to fit those distributions to the data in the end two parameters were found to be equally suitable to reproduce the variability observed in the experimental data additional data in the future may tell which of the two parameters is the most biologically plausible the variability of two life history traits that are closely related to population growth was predicted well by the model supporting its potential use in ibms although we advise against extrapolating the results of this study to other deb organisms one to one we hope that the methods established in this study inspire other researchers to carry out similar studies with different species credit authorship contribution statement josef

24787,there is growing interest in using mechanistic ecosystem models for ecosystem based management as they have the advantage of capturing both bottom up and top down processes as well as system interactions from food web structure spatial constraints and human activities however they have the disadvantage of requiring many parameters many of which are unknown and must be estimated or calibrated to available data sensitivity analysis sa is an important part of simulation model development in order to understand model uncertainty and which parameters are more or less influential but has been relatively neglected with atlantis models due to the large number of parameters and long simulation run time the atlantis eastern english channel atlantis eec model has been applied to investigate ecosystem dynamics and processes as well as fishery management scenarios here we present the results of a sa of growth mortality and recruitment parameters which are parameters particularly difficult to measure and thus commonly tuned through model calibration to manage the large number of parameters in the model we used a morris screening approach this method can efficiently provide information on parameter main effects and interactions non linear effects with relatively few simulations we performed an initial sa including all groups on 90 parameters where we found that the most important drivers of system dynamics and biomass across groups were 1 plankton growth and mortality rates and 2 top predator s fixed recruitment and juvenile mortality rates we then performed a follow up sa on a subset of 61 parameters excluding top predators and plankton groups from the analysis we found that all parameters were important for system stability while individual groups biomass were generally most influenced by their own parameters and a subset of benthic invertebrates nonlinear interaction effects were widespread demonstrating the prevalence of feedback loops in the trophic structure and the importance of bottom up effects and to a lesser extent top down effects the information gained from this sa provided a better understanding of the model structure it also allowed us to make recommendations on the general atlantis model calibration process as well as suggesting which parameters may be most important for propagation of uncertainty in model scenarios keywords sensitivity analysis morris screening atlantis eastern english channel ecosystem model marine food web 1 introduction ecosystem models are growing in popularity in fisheries management in tandem with the rise of ecosystem based management ebm in recognition of the complex ecosystem interactions that are rarely or only partially incorporated into traditional single species models curtin and prellezo 2010 garcia et al 2003 pikitch et al 2004 skern mauritzen et al 2016 in particular end to end ecosystem models strive to include all major relevant processes ranging from mechanistic processes like hydrodynamics and nutrient cycling to food web interactions to human activity in one modeling framework fulton 2010 one particular end to end ecosystem model is atlantis fulton et al 2011 audzijonyte et al 2019 which has been implemented across at least 25 ecosystems around the globe with more in development weijerman et al 2016a atlantis models have been used to investigate different management strategies fulton et al 2014 kaplan et al 2012 weijerman et al 2016b potential impacts of climate change on ecosystems griffith et al 2012 marshall et al 2017 nye et al 2013 ortega cisneros et al 2018 and impacts of extreme events such as oil spills ainsworth et al 2018 morzaria luna et al 2018 however a drawback of end to end ecosystem models in general and atlantis models in particular is the sheer number of parameters combined with the long running time which makes robust calibration and evaluation of the model difficult arhonditsis and brett 2004 fulton 2010 rose et al 2010 due to these challenges sensitivity analyses sas of atlantis models are rare and have tended to be local rather than global meaning they explore small changes around the nominal values of parameters e g the calibrated model rather than a more complete exploration of the parameters space iooss and lemaître 2015 for example ortega cisnerosa et al 2017 utilized a full factorial design but changed only the growth rate parameter for three plankton groups to three different values sturludottir et al 2018 likewise examined parameters for plankton growth as well as vertebrate recruitment and oceanographic regime kaplan et al 2012 modified the fishing mortalities across all fleets and all species by five values as well as tested removing spatial management a more comprehensive sa was undertaken by hansen et al 2019 involving four parameters for nine different groups utilizing primarily a one at a time oat design centered on baseline values however problems with a simple oat approach of varying one parameter while holding the rest constant at baseline values are that is a local approach thus it presumes model linearity and has also been shown to inadequately explore the parameter space particularly as the number of parameters increases saltelli and annoni 2010 additionally a simple oat sa cannot identify interactions among parameters on the other hand the full factorial designs used for few parameters and groups are not scalable to a comprehensive sa of an atlantis model pantus 2007 used a precursor to atlantis to examine adaptive screening where the experimental design is not pre specified rather information from each experiment is used to design the next thus adaptively exploring the parameter space however adaptive screening generally assumes relatively few parameters i e 10 20 of the total are responsible for most of the response variance and that the effects of parameter interactions are small which are increasingly violated the longer the model is run for and thus was not successful when running the model beyond 10 years in this paper we take a global screening approach to perform a more comprehensive sa of an atlantis model for growth recruitment and mortality parameters we chose a morris analysis morris 1991 the most complete screening method iooss and lemaître 2015 and a recommended alternative to a simple oat sa for models with long run times that preclude more expensive variance based methods saltelli and annoni 2010 we propose that this approach could be used for existing atlantis models as well as facilitate performing a sa as part of model development for new atlantis implementations we performed the sa on the atlantis eastern english channel atlantis eec model which was developed to investigate the ecosystem dynamics and effects of fisheries in that system girardin et al 2018 located between england and france the eastern english channel is a shallow temperate continental shelf sea characterized by strong megatidal hydrodynamics vertical mixing present throughout the year resuspension of particulate matter and significant freshwater and nutrient inputs from rivers particularly the seine river bailly du bois and dumas 2005 korotenko et al 2013 ecologically the system is characterized by both high benthic productivity and a strong bentho pelagic coupling desroy et al 2003 giraldo et al 2017 kopp et al 2015 the species assemblages are structured by the abiotic habitat and constitute a diversity of species pelagic flatfish gadoids skates catsharks crustaceans and cephalopods exploited by different fishing fleets vaz et al 2007 carpentier et al 2009 our goals for the sa are 1 to better understand the internal structure and dynamics of the atlantis eec model in particular the effect on atlantis model outputs of a change in parameter inputs 2 to provide information to aid calibration of new atlantis models and potential future automatic calibration efforts e g fennel et al 2001 and 3 to determine which parameters are most influential on atlantis model output however a set of non influential parameters that can be fixed to nominal values is unlikely to be found for two reasons we evaluate parameters frequently tuned during calibration and thus already known to be sensitive and models with feedback loops such as the trophic network in complex ecological models have high levels of interactions and thus all parameters can potentially influence outputs pantus 2007 we hypothesize that the strong bentho pelagic coupling in the eec may be reflected in the sa through bottom up effects of parameters for benthic producers influencing benthic and pelagic consumers 2 methods 2 1 model we performed the sa on the atlantis eec model girardin et al 2018 an implementation of the atlantis framework audzijonyte et al 2019 fulton et al 2011 atlantis is an end to end ecosystem model comprising of biophysical trophic food web and fisheries components which uses a set of deterministic mechanistic equations to represent the underlying processes of ecosystem dynamics and tracks nitrogen through the system fig 1 the atlantis eec model covers approximately 35 000 km2 and is spatially structured by 35 polygons hydrodynamic forcing is from the integrated output of the mars3d model for applications at regional scales numerical coastal hydrodynamic model baily du bois and dumas 2005 and freshwater and nutrient inputs from rivers were also included the trophic network is represented by 40 functional groups 21 vertebrate groups 16 invertebrate groups including 4 plankton groups and 3 detrital groups table a 1 vertebrate groups are each subdivided into 10 age classes while invertebrate groups are considered as biomass pools with the exception of cephalopods that have juvenile and adult stages while the original model considered multiple fishing fleets organized by fishing activities or métiers we opted to simplify this portion of the model by utilizing a single fishing fleet with constant fishing mortality per functional group 2 2 selected parameters from the thousands of possible atlantis parameters we focused our efforts on the parameters most frequently tuned during the model calibration process audzijonyte et al 2019 those governing growth c mum mortality ml mq and recruitment bhalpha bhbeta kdenr applied across the vertebrate and invertebrate plankton groups table 1 even with this restricted list of parameters the total number was still over 500 parameters across functional groups and age classes due to the long simulation running time 4 h with an intel i5 6440hq 2 60 ghz processor we thus examined ways to further reduce the number of parameters examined we now briefly describe how the parameters we selected function in the atlantis model and we direct the interested reader to audzijonyte et al 2019 particularly supplement 1 for a more complete description of atlantis model equations to girardin et al 2018 for how baseline parameter values were determined and to appendix a for more details on the parameters in the sa 2 2 1 growth consumption parameters the parameters c and mum are used in the model to describe how much prey biomass is consumed by each predator relative to what is available atlantis eec uses a modified holling type ii functional response murray and parslow 1997 to describe predation and the amount of biomass for each prey group i consumed by a predator j is expressed as a consumption term crij 1 c r i j c j a i j b i 1 c j m u m j k a k j b k e k j where bi is the biomass of prey i aij is the availability of prey i to predator j and ekj is the assimilation efficiency of prey k for predator j specifically for predator j cj is the clearance rate or volume of water searched by an active predator or filtered by a filter feeder and mumj is the maximum consumption rate or growth rate which can be thought of as the inverse of the handling time the values for the parameters c and mum are strongly correlated as a consequence of model construction where an initial relationship between c and mum was assumed and only adjusted slightly for some groups as necessary during the model calibration process audzijonyte et al 2019 we therefore opted to move these parameters together using the linear relationship mum 3 c for vertebrate groups and the baseline mum value for invertebrate groups appendix a this means that we are running sa on the growth parameter i e the combined effects of c and mum for phytoplankton the growth equation is different mum is the maximum specific growth rate and is multiplied by the biomass and a light limitation factor thus we varied mum directly in this case appendix a for vertebrate groups with growth parameters defined per age classes changing them independently would result in ecologically unrealistic values and require many parameters instead for each vertebrate group i we used a function of a single hyperparameter ai based on allometric relationships between the clearance rate at age x ci x and the nitrogen dry weight at age of an average individual wi x as suggested by audzijonyte et al 2019 2 c i x a i w i x 0 7 where the age x is n 1 10 we estimated ai by fitting the function to the existing baseline values for c using least squares fig b 1 table a 2 and manipulated ai in the sa thereby reducing 20 parameters per group 10 age class values for c and 10 age class values for mum parameters per group to 1 2 2 2 asymptotic recruitment two stock recruitment relations are used in atlantis eec beverton holt bh for all the fish functional groups and fixed recruitment a fixed number of pups per adult for mammals and birds the bh stock recruit relationship is given by 3 r s p b h a l p h a b b h b e t a where sp is the spawn produced b is the group s total biomass and bhalpha and bhbeta are the bh α and β parameters to examine its sensitivity we chose to constrain the sa to the asymptotic part of the equation see appendix a and investigate only the asymptotic recruitment parameter bhalpha leaving bhbeta fixed for mammals and birds recruitment is defined as 4 r k d e n r ρ n where kdenr specifies the number of pups per adult ρ is the proportion of mature individuals and n is the total number of individuals in this case recruits are calculated as a number of individuals and an initial size is specified to convert into biomass 2 2 3 natural mortalities most atlantis model are calibrated to capture mortality through fishing and predation mortality however for some functional groups additional mortality can be used to mimic other processes not explicitly modeled for vertebrate groups this additional mortality is represented as 5 m m l m q n n based on their numbers n and uses stage specific juvenile and adult values while for invertebrate groups it is instead based on biomass b 6 m m l m q b b where in both cases ml represents linear additional mortality and mq represents quadratic additional mortality non zero mortality is classically used for invertebrate groups to enforce density dependence due to space limitation therefore a quadratic mortality term suitable for density dependent processes is defined for invertebrates groups while the linear mortality is set to zero conversely for top predators e g large fish marine mammals sea birds and a few other fish groups with sources of mortality that are not included in the model through predation and fishing non zero linear mortality and rarely quadratic mortality are used table 1 appendix a for the 13 groups that have a value of zero for mortality in the calibrated model meaning all mortality is already accounted for by fishing and predation the outcome of changing the value to a non zero value would be testing the effect of the parameter outside the range of meaningful values or in effect testing the impact of decreasing the biomass of that group on the ecosystem thus we did not include mortality parameters with a baseline value of zero in the sa and left their value fixed at zero 2 3 defining parameter bounds the approach described above thus allowed us to reduce the number of parameters to examine in the sa to 90 to determine upper and lower bounds for each parameter in the sa we first considered if there were any data available to inform our choice of parameter bounds for the bhalpha parameter we compiled 2018 ices international council for the exploration of the sea stock assessment data for all species in the model for which stock distributions in the assessment encompassed the eec table a 3 and assembled the time series of estimated recruitment and spawning stock biomass ssb for each species for each species only the years with ssb above blim were retained as we focused on the asymptotic part of the stock recruitment relationship then for each year we calculated the recruitment error or the percentage difference in recruitment relative to the average recruitment over the entire time series the 5th and 95th percentiles across all the years were used as the upper and lower bounds for the percent change from the baseline bhalpha value in the calibrated atlantis eec model for functional groups with no assessment available the same method was applied using the ices data for all species combined for other parameters i e growth mortality and non beverton holt recruitment data to set parameter bounds was unavailable and we used the upper and lower bounds of 50 and 100 around the baseline parameter value girardin et al 2018 table a 4 these bounds were based on an examination of parameter ranges used in the small number of existing sas for atlantis models hansen et al 2019 kaplan et al 2012 ortega cisnerosa et al 2017 sturludottir et al 2018 as well as a small series of test simulations on key groups identified by girardin et al 2018 to explore model outcomes of different magnitudes of parameter value changes in particular we wanted to avoid parameter values that would frequently lead to group extinctions which was a problem with larger decreases from parameter baseline values like 75 the doubling and halving of these values allows us to account for the asymmetric nature of increasing and decreasing by a fixed percentage and was verified in some preliminary simulations 2 4 sensitivity analysis plan we used a morris screening analysis morris 1991 as a feasible approach given the number of parameters we had to analyze the long running time of the simulation and our access to datarmor ifremer s supercomputer the advantage of the morris method is that one obtains information for both the main effects linear effects and the non linear effects and or interactions although one is not able to distinguish between non linear effects and interactions like more comprehensive decomposition of variance methods with the morris method the parameter space is turned into a grid by discretizing the space into a user defined number of subintervals the more subintervals the finer the evaluation of non linearities will be though possibly at the cost of a thorough exploration of the space one follows a set of trajectories through parameter space each trajectory starts with a random point in parameter space and then each step consists of moving one parameter in turn from a set of trajectories the elementary effects ee can be calculated that is the changes in the output measure for a relative change in the input parameter the standard set of metrics calculated from the elementary effects morris 1991 are µi the mean of the ee the average change in output across all changes to the parameter i which gives the sensitivity of output to input i due to all first and higher order effects and σi the standard deviation of ee the variance in how much the output changes in response to changes in the parameter i which indicates interactions and or non linearities in addition the metric µi is similar to µi except the absolute value is first applied to the ee before the mean is taken i e the average absolute value of change in output across all changes to parameter i which is useful for the sensitivity of the parameter independent of cancelling out effects if the direction of the change in output is not always consistent campolongo et al 2007 furthermore we used the intervals of σ µ established by sanchez et al 2014 to classify parameter effects into different zones almost linear σ µ 0 1 monotonic 0 1 σ µ 0 5 almost monotonic 0 5 σ µ 1 and markedly non monotonic or with interactions σ µ 1 and these zones are demarcated in the figures we performed two morris sas both of which used 50 trajectories at the high end of recommended ranges for the number of trajectories saltelli et al 2004 campolongo et al 2007 8 levels for each parameter including upper and lower bounds with values uniformly distributed between them and the recommended grid jump of 4 how many levels the parameter changes for a step in the trajectory the 50 trajectories were selected from a candidate set of 200 trajectories as the most orthogonal and thereby best spanning the parameter space campolongo et al 2007 because computing resources are often limited and other models have even longer running times we also considered the impact of using fewer trajectories 10 20 30 and 40 trajectories by performing a bootstrap test with 100 sampled trajectory sets for each size to compare with the results from all 50 trajectories we compared the estimation of µ and σ for the top five parameters for as well as the agreement in order of the top ten parameters between each subset and the full trajectory set we created the sa plan and calculated the resulting ee using the morris method in the sensitivity r package iooss et al 2019 we ran the full set of simulations on the datarmor supercomputer we performed an initial sa sa1 with the full parameter set of 90 parameters with 4550 simulations from the results of sa1 we first investigated the crashing simulations 9 trajectories then analyzed the morris metrics µ µ σ for the non crashing i e complete trajectories 41 trajectories based on the results of that analysis we determined that the parameters implicated in the crashing simulations and those with the most important effects were the parameters of the fixed recruitment top predator groups and the plankton groups see table a 4 for a complete list of parameters in each analysis and values for each level thus the complete sa is described in three steps 1 analysis of parameter values and combinations with extreme effect i e those that crash the model in sa1 2 analysis of parameter effects for the trajectories without crashing simulations for sa1 and 3 analysis of parameter effects in sa2 for the core food web excluding top predator and plankton groups for all the analyses we ran the simulations for 100 years enough time for the calibrated model to reach a steady state and then took as outputs the average biomass for the last 10 years of the simulation years 91 100 for the 40 groups in the model note that not all parameter combinations in the sa allow the system to reach a steady state and we also analyzed the system stability as discussed below for the 21 vertebrate groups we also examined the average number of individuals for the last 10 years of the simulation these outputs are used during calibration and offer good insight into the system state in order to summarize the effects of a parameter for the system in addition to its effect on each group individually we examined total biomass excluding detrital and bacteria groups and total numbers for vertebrates note that this does weight more massive or abundant groups higher but total biomass numbers is a commonly used metric and we also report results for individual groups finally we also looked at the stability of the system by examining how many groups achieved equilibrium in the last ten years of the simulation an important criterion for model calibration any group that had a biomass 0 1 t functionally extinct in the last ten years was defined to be non stable as well as all groups in crashing simulations for the rest we fit a linear model to the last ten years of biomass values for each group and defined stability as the regression line staying within 5 of the mean biomass of the last ten years this criteria is more flexible than simply examining the significance of the slope coefficient possibly significant even for very small changes in biomass or a strict window approach frequently not met by plankton and recycling groups which exhibit cyclic behavior even at equilibrium but still detects groups that continue to increase or decrease at the end of the simulation note that we are simply looking for any steady state not that the groups reach equilibrium at a specific value as in model calibration we examined the influence of parameters on system stability by calculating the morris metrics on the output of the percent of groups stable in the simulations all analysis was performed using r 3 6 0 r core team 2019 we used atlantis version trunk rev 6290 3 results 3 1 step 1 crashing simulations and stability in sa1 crashing simulations of the 4550 simulations in sa1 244 simulations crashed affecting 9 of the trajectories in atlantis simulations crash when any flux reaches a fixed threshold in our simulations the cause of the crash was the same in all cases an accumulation of too much detrital matter to be processed in the epibenthic layer which was due to a population explosion in some groups and extinction in others we determined that the crashes were due to a combination of low juvenile linear mortality rate and high reproduction rate for toothed cetaceans cet appendix b with no density dependence or trophic control for this top predator which uses fixed recruitment this leads to a population explosion stability an average of 69 range 0 95 of groups were stable across all simulations including those that crashed which were considered unstable and in 6 of simulations there were no groups stable fig 2 like with the results for the crashing simulations cetacean juvenile mortality and recruitment rates were extremely influential for determining system stability fig 3 c the juvenile mortality and recruitments rates for seabirds sb and seals sxx were also influential for system stability as were phytoplankton pp and zooplankton zoo growth rates 3 2 step 2 trajectories without crashes in sa1 parameters that had strong main effects high µ values also tended to have strong interaction and or nonlinear effects high σ values both for total biomass and numbers fig 3 and for individual groups fig b 2 generally seabirds seals and especially toothed cetacean parameters as well as those of phytoplankton and zooplankton had the strongest effects fig 3 including important effects across many groups figs 4 b 2 while all parameters influenced at least one group s biomass most groups biomass was strongly affected by a small subset of parameters figs 4 b 2 recruitment parameters generally that of the same group were also important to explain individual vertebrate groups numbers fig b 3 b 4 appendix b we next discuss the effects of the most influential parameters those of plankton and fixed recruitment top predators on biomass for all other groups the parameter effects can be broadly divided into three categories 1 those with moderate to strong effects across many groups biomass primarily consisting of the growth and mortality rates for benthic invertebrates 2 those with strong effects on their own group but no other groups which was true for many parameters generally growth and mortality rates for invertebrates and growth and recruitment rates for vertebrates and finally 3 those with weak or little effect mostly vertebrate mortality rates other than top predators with fixed recruitment top predator growth and adult mortality rates and some primary production parameters fig 4 these other groups are examined in more detail in sa2 3 2 1 plankton production parameters the growth rate parameters of phytoplankton and zooplankton had strong effects on nearly all groups biomass demonstrating bottom up effects fig 4 fig b 2 the direction of the effect was consistent increasing the phytoplankton growth rate had a strong positive effect and that of zooplankton a strong negative effect fig 4 center panel in fact the only groups biomass not strongly influenced were the bird and mammal top predators using fixed recruitment that were driven solely by their own parameters as well as cephalopods cep and refractory detritus dr biomass which were mostly affected by seabird and cetacean parameters the effects of zooplankton mortality rates on biomass were also broad though less consistent in direction of effect within some groups i e µ small compared to µ indicating the sign of the effect varied across simulations for that group carnivorous zoc and gelatinous zog zooplankton parameters as well as phytoplankton s mortality parameter generally had little effect across groups biomass the effects of lower trophic level parameters on was stronger on biomass than vertebrate numbers appendix b 3 2 2 top predator parameters the recruitment and mortality parameters of top predators with fixed recruitment seabirds seals and particularly toothed cetaceans strongly influenced the biomass of nearly all groups fig 4 b 2 the only groups relatively unaffected by these parameters were each other s biomass and that of planktons and scallops sce furthermore these effects are likely understated due to the removal of trajectories with crashing simulations which were found to be due to specific toothed cetacean parameter combinations this interplay between parameters could play a role in the strong interaction nonlinear effects large σ observed the direction of the effect µ varied by group while model crashes were only observed from toothed cetacean parameters with low mortality and high recruitment some combinations of sea bird and seal parameters also caused their biomass to increase exponentially in some simulations and correspondingly many of their prey species went extinct the juvenile mortality parameter appears to be the most sensitive in the case of juvenile toothed cetacean mortality parameters any increase above the baseline value always resulted in their own extinction while decreases from the baseline value resulted in a range of outcomes from extinction to exponential growth the situation was similar but less extreme for sea bird and seal parameters and the direction of the effect was less consistent the effects of these population explosions and resulting extinctions can also be seen through the importance of top predator recruitment and mortality parameters on vertebrate numbers appendix b 3 3 step 3 core food web in sa2 removing the most influential parameters from sa1 those of top predators with fixed recruitment and plankton table 1 focused the sa on the parameters for the core of the food web with the system generally in a stable state i e without the extinctions and exponential growth that characterized many simulations in sa1 for total biomass of the system the growth rates and to a lesser extent mortality rates of benthic invertebrates had the strongest influence while total vertebrate numbers were primarily driven by the parameters of the most numerous groups fig 5 we next discuss the influential parameters for system stability and groups biomass in more detail there were fewer influential parameters for vertebrate numbers than for biomass and a group s own recruitment rate was the most important appendix b 3 3 1 stability stability was considerably higher in sa2 than sa1 with an average of 95 range 80 100 groups stable and all 40 groups were stable in12 of simulations fig 2 with the narrower range of stability in sa2 there was a gradient of effect of the various parameters on the system stability though deposit feeder mortality was the most influential while clupeidae clu quadratic mortality the least fig 5 thus all the parameters had some influence on the stability of the system in non linear and or interacting ways 3 3 2 biomass the most influential parameters on total biomass were the growth rates of benthic invertebrates such as echinoderms ech bivalves biv deposit feeders dep scallops and suspension feeders sus and to a lesser extent some of these groups mortality rates fig 5 and these same parameters are also important across numerous individual groups biomass figs 6 b 5 the biomasses of plankton and recycling groups which did not have their parameters modified in sa2 were strongly influenced by nearly every parameter while the direction of effect for these parameters was generally inconsistent fig 6 and with strong non linear interaction effects fig b 5 groups differed in how linear or non linear the impact of influential parameters was on their biomass likely due to different positions in the food web fig b 5 for example the impact of most parameters was clearly non monotonic or with interactions non linearities for the biomass of cephalopods echinoderms lobsters lbe pollack pol suspension feeders and whelk whe on the contrary the biomass of pelagics and their predators that is clupeids mackerels sparidae cetaceans sea birds and seals responded to parameters in a more linear way probably because of the weaker influence of benthic compartments most groups biomass was primarily influenced by between two and ten parameters their own and those of several other groups figs 6 and b 5 the other group s parameters were generally those of the more abundant vertebrate and invertebrate groups and were frequently but not always prey of the affected group groups biomass being influenced by their predators parameters on the other hand was more rare and only tended to occur with the biomass of groups at the lowest tropic level finally there were a handful of groups affected almost solely by their own parameters clupeidae mackerels mac scallops and sharks shk these groups except for sharks have a plankton detritus diet in common the parameters of which were not changed in sa2 however suspension feeders share a similar diet but their biomass was also influenced by their predators parameters the food web interactions can be seen through the direction of the effect fig 6 µ columns for example bivalve s growth rate had a generally positive impact on other groups biomass except for phytoplankton prey and suspension feeders competition similarly deposit feeder s growth rate had a generally positive effect on other groups biomass except for their prey and competitors while the growth rate of echinoderms almost universally negatively affected other groups biomass except phytoplankton for nearly all vertebrate groups biomass as well as larger invertebrates like shrimp shp lobsters and cephalopods the groups parameters strongly influenced that same group s biomass but had little effect on the biomass of other groups excepting plankton and recycling groups influenced by all or most parameters as noted above the parameters for clupeidae and to a lesser extent whiting whg both of which are numerous in the system had a strong influence on the biomass of top bird and mammal predators for which they are an important food source but little influence on their benthic prey interestingly only seal biomass was also influenced by a number of other fish groups parameters reflecting diet differences mortality parameters were generally less influential than growth rate 3 4 sa1 and sa2 summary to summarize the most important results of the sa strong main effects of parameters tended to go hand in hand with strong interaction and or nonlinear effects and all parameters influenced system stability the strongest effects were due to fixed recruitment top predators particularly the juvenile mortality and reproduction rates and plankton particularly phytoplankton and zooplankton growth rates there was also high sensitivity to benthos parameters particularly growth rate across nearly all groups each group s biomass tended to be highly sensitive to 2 10 parameters their own and more commonly their prey than their predators vertebrate numbers were most often linearly influenced by a group s own recruitment rate 3 5 number of trajectories 3 5 1 sa1 in general µ and σ estimates for the most influential parameters for most groups in sa1 were robust with respect to the number of trajectories figs b 8 b 9 exceptions were parameters affecting fixed recruitment top predators phytoplankton bacteria and detrital groups where smaller estimations of effect size were likely with fewer trajectories furthermore interaction nonlinear effects of the recruitment and mortality parameters of fixed recruitment top predators were smaller for numerous groups perhaps more important is the relative ordering of the most important parameters which was in agreement on average of 82 for µ and 72 for σ even for only 10 trajectories across all groups and numbers of trajectories the agreement in ordering the most influential parameters was higher for µ than σ demonstrating the increased difficulty in estimating the non linear interaction effects fig b 10 3 5 2 sa2 the error with estimating sa metrics with fewer trajectories was greatly reduced in sa2 with greater system stability figs b 11 b 12 the agreement for ordering the most influential parameters was generally quite good except for some bacteria detrital and plankton groups whose parameters were not included in sa2 fig b 15 across all groups the agreement averaged 87 for µ and 80 for σ for 10 trajectories increasing to 95 and 93 respectively for 40 trajectories 4 discussion while sa has long been recognized as an important part of ecological model development scott 1996 shaeffer d l 1980 thornton et al 1979 it has generally been neglected for atlantis models but see hansen et al 2019 kaplan et al 2012 ortega cisnerosa et al 2017 sturludottir et al 2018 due to computational challenges with long run times and technical challenges with the large number of parameters we demonstrate the feasibility of a large scale sa on a complex ecosystem model and illustrate a number of ways to accommodate a large number of parameters first even if computationally feasible the sheer number of parameters in atlantis means a complete sa on all parameters would be uninterpretable and thus some pre selection of parameters must take place in this paper we focused on the growth recruitment and mortality parameters most frequently adjusted during calibration but other approaches are possible such as examining the diet matrix morzaria luna et al 2018 choosing parameters to determine where the most improvement could be found through improved data collection lebauer et al 2013 or with an eye to uncertainty analysis to quantify the impact of parameter uncertainty on output variability cariboni et al 2007 another important technique we utilized was collapsing many valued age structured parameters with a function utilizing a hyperparameter that was manipulated in the sa additionally we moved correlated parameters together which both reduced the number of parameters to consider in the sa and maintained ecological coherence among the set of parameters using a morris screening sa allowed us to perform a global analysis with relatively few simulations and thus differentiate effects as approximately linear monotonic or nonlinear interactions finally like morzaria luna et al 2018 our analysis would not have been possible without access to supercomputer resources and we suggest these resources are generally essential to carrying out sas of complex ecosystem models furthermore we suggest that these advances imply that new atlantis model implementations should incorporate sa in the model development as suggested by modeling guidelines cariboni et al 2007 and which have already started being carried out hansen et al 2019 4 1 interesting insights about the atlantis eec model our results highlight a difficulty raised by patus 2007 that finding parameters that are less sensitive and thus can be ignored in models that contain cyclic feedbacks like atlantis is perhaps unrealistic our results generally confirm this bearing in mind that we selected the parameters most frequently tuned during calibration and thus already known to be sensitive there could certainly be insensitive parameters among the many remaining parameters in atlantis while there are perhaps only a handful of more influential parameters for any given group the effects were almost never strictly linear and frequently show evidence of nonlinear interaction effects in addition every parameter was influential for at least one group illustrating why all parameters were important for system stability although in sa1 there were some growth and mortality parameters that had little effect on biomass across all groups fig 4 and a subset of those that had little effect on numbers fig b 3 these parameters did still affect system stability furthermore for those parameters that were also included in sa2 all appear to influence biomass at least interact with numbers and especially contribute to system stability fig 5 with that caveat the least influential parameters were adult mortality and growth rates for vertebrates with fixed recruitment juvenile mortality rate for some vertebrates with bh recruitment cephalopod growth rate growth and mortality rates for gelatinous zooplankton and phytoplankton mortality rate the lack of influence of the phytoplankton mortality rate was particularly striking given the strong effects of phytoplankton growth rates and of both growth and mortality rates for zooplankton the importance of both top down and bottom up effects is evident with the most influential parameters these include those of top predators with fixed recruitment i e toothed cetaceans sea birds seals and illustrate a structural issue with the atlantis eec model these top predators are not density dependent either through their recruitment or mortality allowing them to increase exponentially that is they reproduce through pups rather than a self limiting bh recruitment function and like other vertebrates in the model with the exception of clupeidae they have no quadratic mortality furthermore they are not impacted by the fishery and experience little predation themselves these groups are thus very sensitive to their parameterization particularly the reproduction rate and the juvenile mortality rate which can quickly shift the population from extinction to unrealistic exponential growth to dampen these effects different values of starvation mortality currently underutilized in atlantis models pethybridge et al 2019 should be explored in the atlantis eec model to better represent competition among top predators and the effects of limited food in addition unfished top predators modeled with atlantis could be controlled by a quadratic mortality term and or a modified fecundity using the ratio of reserve to structural nitrogen additionally the lack of starvation mortality likely explains the decoupling observed between biomass and numbers in vertebrates biomass and number do not react the same way numbers are primarily determined by a group s own reproduction parameter and top predator parameters in sa1 which drove extinctions while biomass is determined by individual weights that depend on growth rates and prey abundance thus it is possible to have large numbers of individuals at below normal weights who do not die at increased rates this makes numbers less sensitive to trophic network effects than biomass bottom up control was emphasized by the other extremely sensitive parameters the growth rates of phytoplankton and zooplankton hansen et al 2019 also found the strongest effects in response to changing the growth rates for zooplankton groups while the sa performed by ortega cisneros et al 2017 only included the growth rate of phytoplankton and zooplankton they also observed large effects throughout the food web particularly on phytoplankton and zooplankton themselves and small pelagic fish though large pelagic fish were less sensitive sturludottir et al 2018 found a strong response to phytoplankton growth rate but not macrozooplankton growth rate though other zooplankton groups were not included this sensitivity to plankton dynamics has also been found in other ecosystem models steele and ruzicka 2011 reflecting the importance of both primary producers to bottom up forcing as well as the role of zooplankton in linking trophic levels carlotti and poggiale 2010 rose et al 2010 however this importance of plankton dynamics also highlights a challenge of parameterizing end to end ecosystem models given data limitations for plankton communities this is further complicated by the fact that for reasons of the relatively coarse spatiotemporal scale the plankton dynamics are represented with less detail in comparison with existing npz models baretta et al 1995 butenschön et al 2016 kishi et al 2007 schrum et al 2006 the universal positive effect of a higher phytoplankton growth rate on all groups is unsurprising but the opposite universally negative effect of a higher zooplankton growth rate even for zooplankton itself is striking and counterintuitive there are several possible reasons first atlantis does not explicitly model the larval stage for fish the option for phytoplankton and or zooplankton abundance to affect recruitment is not utilized in the atlantis eec model which depend heavily on zooplankton last 1978a 1978b however zooplankton makes up the majority of the diet 80 99 for mackerels clupeidae which both migrate outside the system carnivorous zooplankton and gelatinous zooplankton as well as a significant portion of the diet 5 20 for mulgilidae shrimps and zooplankton itself more likely a higher zooplankton growth rate causes the zooplankton to increase and consume all the phytoplankton which then cannot regrow i e the extreme case of lotka voltera dynamics no oscillation this would cut off the pelagic pathway and could cut off the benthic pathway in the ecosystem as many benthic invertebrates are planktivores and phytoplankton is particularly important in the diet of suspension feeders and scallops finally an increase in the zooplankton growth rate might divert energy from the detrital benthic pathway by consuming plankton that would otherwise die and so could contribute the negative response seen across groups even in relatively simple npz models where multiple functional forms are used for zooplankton grazing e g eq 1 this relationship is known to be problematic and a strong determinant of system dynamics franks 2002 examining the direction of the effects µ of different parameters elucidates the complex food web dynamics captured in the atlantis eec model the inconsistent direction of effects of top predator parameters demonstrates indirect effects that is negative effects on their prey s biomass but positive effects on the biomass of their prey s prey while fixed recruitment top predators do appear to structure the entire ecosystem in the sense of a trophic cascade paine 1980 ripple et al 2016 in sa1 this is not the case under more stable conditions in sa2 where we saw weaker effects of upper trophic level predators parameters on other groups biomass in the system for example the parameters of the more abundant predators such as whiting and other gadidae gad had little effect on their benthic prey s biomass rather the most influential parameters were those of the invertebrate benthic groups particularly the growth rates thus confirming the bottom up dynamics of the system the sa thus supported our hypothesis of important effect from benthic parameters based on the strong bentho pelagic coupling in the system and this would be interesting to confirm with a more thorough validation analysis of the model the eec ecosystem is a shallow continental shelf sea driven by benthic productivity dauvin and desroy 2005 desroy et al 2003 garcia et al 2011 the food web structure is comprised of benthic and pelagic pathways and the bentho pelagic coupling increases in shallow coastal areas where both benthic and pelagic sources are easily available kopp et al 2015 benthic sources make up the majority of the diet for all trophic groups ranging from just over 50 for even pelagic piscivorous fish to 100 for groups such as benthic predators and demersal piscivorous fish giraldo et al 2017 furthermore this importance of benthos to eec ecosystem functioning has also been found with a variety of modeling approaches daskalov et al 2011 girardin et al 2018 travers trolet et al 2019 4 2 implications for other atlantis models although some insights are specific to the precise formulation of the atlantis eec model girardin et al 2018 such as its trophic and physical structure there is also learning that could apply to other atlantis implementations new atlantis implementations continue to be developed weijerman et al 2016a and calibration of these models is a challenging undertaking the results of this sa can provide additional information to complement existing advice for how to approach calibration audzijonyte et al 2019 pethybridge et al 2019 while we were unable to find a simple list of parameters with minimal effects across all groups this is unsurprising given that we focused on a subset of the most frequently calibrated parameters pethybridge et al 2019 and the known feedback interactions present in atlantis through the trophic structure pantus 2007 however there were still differences in the strength of effect among parameters one important distinction particularly when calibrating models is that between parameters that have a strong main effect on the outcomes of many or nearly all groups versus those parameters whose main effect is primarily on the group itself while the ubiquity of nonlinear interaction effects means there are no parameters that are strictly limited to only influencing their own groups there are clear differences in the degree of interactions the strong contribution of the plankton parameters to system stability and the determination of most groups biomass suggests a useful approach is to first calibrate a simplified npz model pethybridge et al 2019 which was successfully applied for the calibration of the atlantis eec model girardin et al 2018 while the representation of lower trophic levels in atlantis is necessarily coarse given its spatial and temporal resolution pethybridge et al 2019 it is still likely that a subset of these groups will be highly influential for the entire system though which subset appears to be model dependent ortega cisneros et al 2017 hansen et al 2019 sturludottir et al 2018 further the large influence of fixed recruitment top predator parameters on system stability despite those groups comparatively small biomass suggests that it is essential to set parameters for these groups approximately correctly early in the calibration process there was hardly any interaction between fixed recruitment top predator and plankton parameters suggesting the lowest and highest trophic levels could be calibrated sequentially once the highest and lowest trophic levels are stabilized i e sa2 many parameter interactions fall into the monotonic or almost monotonic zone for individual outputs though not total system biomass or stability one surprising discovery was the relatively localized and monotonic effect of manipulating bh recruitment bhalpha with only the group itself affected and no other parameters contributing in most cases in these groups generally fish nonlinear interaction effects were more prevalent with growth and mortality parameters in general growth rates were more important than mortality rates for determining biomass though mortality rates appeared important for controlling system stability for vertebrate groups this may be because most mortality is captured through predation and fishing mortality while mortality rates were more important for invertebrate groups they were still less important than growth rates and this may be due to natural mortality rates being low for invertebrates in the baseline model for context nearly all vertebrate mortality rates that were not zero were above the 1e 5 day 1 threshold pethybridge et al 2019 consider high additional mortality while nearly all invertebrate mortality rates other than plankton were below the threshold groups whose parameters were important to other groups tended to be the most abundant benthic invertebrates and planktivorous fish while it is unclear how much these results depend on the specific trophic network and environment of the atlantis eec model we can make some preliminary suggestions on the order in which to tackle groups within the context of other advice on calibrating atlantis models audzijonyte et al 2019 pethybridge et al 2019 that is 1 calibrate the plankton and recycling groups perhaps as a simplified npz model 2 ensure reasonable avoiding extinction or exponential growth mortality and recruitment rates of fixed or constant recruitment groups generally top predators 3 adjust growth rates of non age structured groups 4 adjust growth rates of age structured groups focusing on high abundance groups 5 adjust mortality rates as needed for stability 6 adjust bh recruitment to match numbers 7 continue to iteratively fine tune groups furthermore if resources are available we suggest that once reasonable starting points for parameters are identified a sa even with few trajectories can be very useful for calibration efforts an important consideration for performing a sa on an atlantis model is what resources are available given the long simulation running times our results indicate that useful information can still be obtained even from many fewer trajectories than the 50 we used here while some form of parallelization would still be essential this may not necessarily require access to a supercomputer there are several considerations with using relatively few trajectories in a highly parameterized and complex model suggested by our analysis most importantly interaction nonlinear effects are likely to be underestimated particularly with very small trajectory samples in general while the effect sizes may vary with smaller numbers of trajectories the approximate ordering of parameters was still fairly accurate these issues may be accentuated if the system frequently becomes unstable in the sa simulations i e groups exploding or going extinct crashes so that repeating the sa in that context may not give consistent results while a sa generally provides information on how much each parameter influences the output an uncertainty analysis ua focuses rather on how much the results are influenced by the uncertainty of the inputs ua comprises a broader context than a sa for example link et al 2012 list six major categories of uncertainty in ecosystem models natural variability observation error inadequate communication among scientists decision makers and stakeholders model structural complexity outcome uncertainty and unclear management objectives uas of complex ecosystem models are also relatively rare uas can highlight how uncertainty in parameter specification translates to uncertainty in model outputs morzaria luna et al 2018 and cross model comparisons can give insight into the effects of uncertainty in process specification fulton et al 2003 smith et al 2015 investigating model uncertainty is a current focus of the atlantis community weijerman et al 2016a our results suggest that one possible starting point would be to include uncertainty in the plankton dynamics as these tend to be data poor particularly zooplankton dynamics and phytoplankton species composition but also influential to system stability and dynamics zooplankton are a key feature of end to end ecosystem models linking lower and upper trophic levels as compared to npz models which focus on biogeochemical cycling or multispecies fish models with simplified representations rose et al 2010 other parameters to consider in a ua scenario could be determined from uncertainty based on the data pedigree pethybridge et al 2019 combined with information from a sa like the one presented here this analysis could be limited to or weighted by the key groups depending on the scenario investigated e g commercially important or threatened species this would allow comparing the magnitude of impact on output of model uncertainties and management alternatives as well as propagating uncertainty in the analysis 4 3 future directions while comprehensive the current sa is still only a first step in understanding the sensitivity of the atlantis eec model to its input parameters here we covered the most frequently calibrated growth mortality and recruitment parameters which are not known precisely but for which some insight is available other parameters which could be crucial but which are rarely changed in atlantis models such as assimilation efficiency or environmental response functions like temperature dependent growth would be interesting to explore future analyses could also take into account how the fishing fleets are parameterized and how the predator prey diet availability matrix is defined earlier work has already demonstrated how species life history traits drive responses to fishing pressure kaplan et al 2012 furthermore an uncertainty analysis of the diet availability matrix showed great variation in the biomass and catch predicted as well as provided a possible framework for conducting a sa of the diet availability matrix morzaria luna et al 2018 finally the sensitivity to model structure such as which functional response or recruitment relationship is used could be important we considered the direct outputs of biomass and vertebrate numbers as well as system stability but future analyses could also include additional outputs like size at age for vertebrates realized diet or consider the outputs spatially rather than aggregated here our aim was two fold to gain insight into model functioning and to provide guidance for calibration therefore we used biomass and numbers as our outputs of interest in order to more precisely inform an automated calibration the sensitivity of the objective function of could also be investigated indeed 1 depending on the formulation of the of other parameters than those affecting absolute biomass and numbers may be shown to be influential and 2 it is worth exploring the sensitivity of alternative formulations of the of beforehand to ensure responsiveness automatic calibration has been successfully implemented for other ecosystem models such as osmose duboz et al 2010 and nemuro rose et al 2007 but has not yet been attempted for an atlantis model a successful automatic calibration framework for atlantis models would provide advantages such as reducing the time necessary to calibrate the model and providing an objective common ground for calibrating different implementations of the model given the complexity and highly parameterized nature of atlantis substantial uncertainty may remain in the parameters that should be characterized and a unique set of parameter values may not be obtained janssen and heuberger 1995 furthermore a sequential calibration approach like that used with osmose may be helpful conducting sas across other atlantis model implementations would allow better understanding of whether parameter sensitivities are due to structural design of the atlantis model locale specific environmental or trophic network effects or perhaps even common trophic structures across models sas of atlantis models including this one have consistently found plankton growth parameters to be important drivers of biomass across groups hansen et al 2019 ortega cisneros et al 2017 sturludottir et al 2018 in particular we recommend the morris screening method morris 1991 as well suited to the complexity and long running time of atlantis models it provides the ability to gain information on nonlinear interaction effects with no linearity assumptions of the model but with the number of simulations required still on the order of a simple oat analysis saltelli and annoni 2010 and has been successfully applied to other end to end marine ecosystem models morris et al 2014 more and more thorough sas across a variety of atlantis models may also allow the simplification of some model processes fulton et al 2003 van nes and scheffer 2005 credit authorship contribution statement chloe bracis conceptualization

24787,there is growing interest in using mechanistic ecosystem models for ecosystem based management as they have the advantage of capturing both bottom up and top down processes as well as system interactions from food web structure spatial constraints and human activities however they have the disadvantage of requiring many parameters many of which are unknown and must be estimated or calibrated to available data sensitivity analysis sa is an important part of simulation model development in order to understand model uncertainty and which parameters are more or less influential but has been relatively neglected with atlantis models due to the large number of parameters and long simulation run time the atlantis eastern english channel atlantis eec model has been applied to investigate ecosystem dynamics and processes as well as fishery management scenarios here we present the results of a sa of growth mortality and recruitment parameters which are parameters particularly difficult to measure and thus commonly tuned through model calibration to manage the large number of parameters in the model we used a morris screening approach this method can efficiently provide information on parameter main effects and interactions non linear effects with relatively few simulations we performed an initial sa including all groups on 90 parameters where we found that the most important drivers of system dynamics and biomass across groups were 1 plankton growth and mortality rates and 2 top predator s fixed recruitment and juvenile mortality rates we then performed a follow up sa on a subset of 61 parameters excluding top predators and plankton groups from the analysis we found that all parameters were important for system stability while individual groups biomass were generally most influenced by their own parameters and a subset of benthic invertebrates nonlinear interaction effects were widespread demonstrating the prevalence of feedback loops in the trophic structure and the importance of bottom up effects and to a lesser extent top down effects the information gained from this sa provided a better understanding of the model structure it also allowed us to make recommendations on the general atlantis model calibration process as well as suggesting which parameters may be most important for propagation of uncertainty in model scenarios keywords sensitivity analysis morris screening atlantis eastern english channel ecosystem model marine food web 1 introduction ecosystem models are growing in popularity in fisheries management in tandem with the rise of ecosystem based management ebm in recognition of the complex ecosystem interactions that are rarely or only partially incorporated into traditional single species models curtin and prellezo 2010 garcia et al 2003 pikitch et al 2004 skern mauritzen et al 2016 in particular end to end ecosystem models strive to include all major relevant processes ranging from mechanistic processes like hydrodynamics and nutrient cycling to food web interactions to human activity in one modeling framework fulton 2010 one particular end to end ecosystem model is atlantis fulton et al 2011 audzijonyte et al 2019 which has been implemented across at least 25 ecosystems around the globe with more in development weijerman et al 2016a atlantis models have been used to investigate different management strategies fulton et al 2014 kaplan et al 2012 weijerman et al 2016b potential impacts of climate change on ecosystems griffith et al 2012 marshall et al 2017 nye et al 2013 ortega cisneros et al 2018 and impacts of extreme events such as oil spills ainsworth et al 2018 morzaria luna et al 2018 however a drawback of end to end ecosystem models in general and atlantis models in particular is the sheer number of parameters combined with the long running time which makes robust calibration and evaluation of the model difficult arhonditsis and brett 2004 fulton 2010 rose et al 2010 due to these challenges sensitivity analyses sas of atlantis models are rare and have tended to be local rather than global meaning they explore small changes around the nominal values of parameters e g the calibrated model rather than a more complete exploration of the parameters space iooss and lemaître 2015 for example ortega cisnerosa et al 2017 utilized a full factorial design but changed only the growth rate parameter for three plankton groups to three different values sturludottir et al 2018 likewise examined parameters for plankton growth as well as vertebrate recruitment and oceanographic regime kaplan et al 2012 modified the fishing mortalities across all fleets and all species by five values as well as tested removing spatial management a more comprehensive sa was undertaken by hansen et al 2019 involving four parameters for nine different groups utilizing primarily a one at a time oat design centered on baseline values however problems with a simple oat approach of varying one parameter while holding the rest constant at baseline values are that is a local approach thus it presumes model linearity and has also been shown to inadequately explore the parameter space particularly as the number of parameters increases saltelli and annoni 2010 additionally a simple oat sa cannot identify interactions among parameters on the other hand the full factorial designs used for few parameters and groups are not scalable to a comprehensive sa of an atlantis model pantus 2007 used a precursor to atlantis to examine adaptive screening where the experimental design is not pre specified rather information from each experiment is used to design the next thus adaptively exploring the parameter space however adaptive screening generally assumes relatively few parameters i e 10 20 of the total are responsible for most of the response variance and that the effects of parameter interactions are small which are increasingly violated the longer the model is run for and thus was not successful when running the model beyond 10 years in this paper we take a global screening approach to perform a more comprehensive sa of an atlantis model for growth recruitment and mortality parameters we chose a morris analysis morris 1991 the most complete screening method iooss and lemaître 2015 and a recommended alternative to a simple oat sa for models with long run times that preclude more expensive variance based methods saltelli and annoni 2010 we propose that this approach could be used for existing atlantis models as well as facilitate performing a sa as part of model development for new atlantis implementations we performed the sa on the atlantis eastern english channel atlantis eec model which was developed to investigate the ecosystem dynamics and effects of fisheries in that system girardin et al 2018 located between england and france the eastern english channel is a shallow temperate continental shelf sea characterized by strong megatidal hydrodynamics vertical mixing present throughout the year resuspension of particulate matter and significant freshwater and nutrient inputs from rivers particularly the seine river bailly du bois and dumas 2005 korotenko et al 2013 ecologically the system is characterized by both high benthic productivity and a strong bentho pelagic coupling desroy et al 2003 giraldo et al 2017 kopp et al 2015 the species assemblages are structured by the abiotic habitat and constitute a diversity of species pelagic flatfish gadoids skates catsharks crustaceans and cephalopods exploited by different fishing fleets vaz et al 2007 carpentier et al 2009 our goals for the sa are 1 to better understand the internal structure and dynamics of the atlantis eec model in particular the effect on atlantis model outputs of a change in parameter inputs 2 to provide information to aid calibration of new atlantis models and potential future automatic calibration efforts e g fennel et al 2001 and 3 to determine which parameters are most influential on atlantis model output however a set of non influential parameters that can be fixed to nominal values is unlikely to be found for two reasons we evaluate parameters frequently tuned during calibration and thus already known to be sensitive and models with feedback loops such as the trophic network in complex ecological models have high levels of interactions and thus all parameters can potentially influence outputs pantus 2007 we hypothesize that the strong bentho pelagic coupling in the eec may be reflected in the sa through bottom up effects of parameters for benthic producers influencing benthic and pelagic consumers 2 methods 2 1 model we performed the sa on the atlantis eec model girardin et al 2018 an implementation of the atlantis framework audzijonyte et al 2019 fulton et al 2011 atlantis is an end to end ecosystem model comprising of biophysical trophic food web and fisheries components which uses a set of deterministic mechanistic equations to represent the underlying processes of ecosystem dynamics and tracks nitrogen through the system fig 1 the atlantis eec model covers approximately 35 000 km2 and is spatially structured by 35 polygons hydrodynamic forcing is from the integrated output of the mars3d model for applications at regional scales numerical coastal hydrodynamic model baily du bois and dumas 2005 and freshwater and nutrient inputs from rivers were also included the trophic network is represented by 40 functional groups 21 vertebrate groups 16 invertebrate groups including 4 plankton groups and 3 detrital groups table a 1 vertebrate groups are each subdivided into 10 age classes while invertebrate groups are considered as biomass pools with the exception of cephalopods that have juvenile and adult stages while the original model considered multiple fishing fleets organized by fishing activities or métiers we opted to simplify this portion of the model by utilizing a single fishing fleet with constant fishing mortality per functional group 2 2 selected parameters from the thousands of possible atlantis parameters we focused our efforts on the parameters most frequently tuned during the model calibration process audzijonyte et al 2019 those governing growth c mum mortality ml mq and recruitment bhalpha bhbeta kdenr applied across the vertebrate and invertebrate plankton groups table 1 even with this restricted list of parameters the total number was still over 500 parameters across functional groups and age classes due to the long simulation running time 4 h with an intel i5 6440hq 2 60 ghz processor we thus examined ways to further reduce the number of parameters examined we now briefly describe how the parameters we selected function in the atlantis model and we direct the interested reader to audzijonyte et al 2019 particularly supplement 1 for a more complete description of atlantis model equations to girardin et al 2018 for how baseline parameter values were determined and to appendix a for more details on the parameters in the sa 2 2 1 growth consumption parameters the parameters c and mum are used in the model to describe how much prey biomass is consumed by each predator relative to what is available atlantis eec uses a modified holling type ii functional response murray and parslow 1997 to describe predation and the amount of biomass for each prey group i consumed by a predator j is expressed as a consumption term crij 1 c r i j c j a i j b i 1 c j m u m j k a k j b k e k j where bi is the biomass of prey i aij is the availability of prey i to predator j and ekj is the assimilation efficiency of prey k for predator j specifically for predator j cj is the clearance rate or volume of water searched by an active predator or filtered by a filter feeder and mumj is the maximum consumption rate or growth rate which can be thought of as the inverse of the handling time the values for the parameters c and mum are strongly correlated as a consequence of model construction where an initial relationship between c and mum was assumed and only adjusted slightly for some groups as necessary during the model calibration process audzijonyte et al 2019 we therefore opted to move these parameters together using the linear relationship mum 3 c for vertebrate groups and the baseline mum value for invertebrate groups appendix a this means that we are running sa on the growth parameter i e the combined effects of c and mum for phytoplankton the growth equation is different mum is the maximum specific growth rate and is multiplied by the biomass and a light limitation factor thus we varied mum directly in this case appendix a for vertebrate groups with growth parameters defined per age classes changing them independently would result in ecologically unrealistic values and require many parameters instead for each vertebrate group i we used a function of a single hyperparameter ai based on allometric relationships between the clearance rate at age x ci x and the nitrogen dry weight at age of an average individual wi x as suggested by audzijonyte et al 2019 2 c i x a i w i x 0 7 where the age x is n 1 10 we estimated ai by fitting the function to the existing baseline values for c using least squares fig b 1 table a 2 and manipulated ai in the sa thereby reducing 20 parameters per group 10 age class values for c and 10 age class values for mum parameters per group to 1 2 2 2 asymptotic recruitment two stock recruitment relations are used in atlantis eec beverton holt bh for all the fish functional groups and fixed recruitment a fixed number of pups per adult for mammals and birds the bh stock recruit relationship is given by 3 r s p b h a l p h a b b h b e t a where sp is the spawn produced b is the group s total biomass and bhalpha and bhbeta are the bh α and β parameters to examine its sensitivity we chose to constrain the sa to the asymptotic part of the equation see appendix a and investigate only the asymptotic recruitment parameter bhalpha leaving bhbeta fixed for mammals and birds recruitment is defined as 4 r k d e n r ρ n where kdenr specifies the number of pups per adult ρ is the proportion of mature individuals and n is the total number of individuals in this case recruits are calculated as a number of individuals and an initial size is specified to convert into biomass 2 2 3 natural mortalities most atlantis model are calibrated to capture mortality through fishing and predation mortality however for some functional groups additional mortality can be used to mimic other processes not explicitly modeled for vertebrate groups this additional mortality is represented as 5 m m l m q n n based on their numbers n and uses stage specific juvenile and adult values while for invertebrate groups it is instead based on biomass b 6 m m l m q b b where in both cases ml represents linear additional mortality and mq represents quadratic additional mortality non zero mortality is classically used for invertebrate groups to enforce density dependence due to space limitation therefore a quadratic mortality term suitable for density dependent processes is defined for invertebrates groups while the linear mortality is set to zero conversely for top predators e g large fish marine mammals sea birds and a few other fish groups with sources of mortality that are not included in the model through predation and fishing non zero linear mortality and rarely quadratic mortality are used table 1 appendix a for the 13 groups that have a value of zero for mortality in the calibrated model meaning all mortality is already accounted for by fishing and predation the outcome of changing the value to a non zero value would be testing the effect of the parameter outside the range of meaningful values or in effect testing the impact of decreasing the biomass of that group on the ecosystem thus we did not include mortality parameters with a baseline value of zero in the sa and left their value fixed at zero 2 3 defining parameter bounds the approach described above thus allowed us to reduce the number of parameters to examine in the sa to 90 to determine upper and lower bounds for each parameter in the sa we first considered if there were any data available to inform our choice of parameter bounds for the bhalpha parameter we compiled 2018 ices international council for the exploration of the sea stock assessment data for all species in the model for which stock distributions in the assessment encompassed the eec table a 3 and assembled the time series of estimated recruitment and spawning stock biomass ssb for each species for each species only the years with ssb above blim were retained as we focused on the asymptotic part of the stock recruitment relationship then for each year we calculated the recruitment error or the percentage difference in recruitment relative to the average recruitment over the entire time series the 5th and 95th percentiles across all the years were used as the upper and lower bounds for the percent change from the baseline bhalpha value in the calibrated atlantis eec model for functional groups with no assessment available the same method was applied using the ices data for all species combined for other parameters i e growth mortality and non beverton holt recruitment data to set parameter bounds was unavailable and we used the upper and lower bounds of 50 and 100 around the baseline parameter value girardin et al 2018 table a 4 these bounds were based on an examination of parameter ranges used in the small number of existing sas for atlantis models hansen et al 2019 kaplan et al 2012 ortega cisnerosa et al 2017 sturludottir et al 2018 as well as a small series of test simulations on key groups identified by girardin et al 2018 to explore model outcomes of different magnitudes of parameter value changes in particular we wanted to avoid parameter values that would frequently lead to group extinctions which was a problem with larger decreases from parameter baseline values like 75 the doubling and halving of these values allows us to account for the asymmetric nature of increasing and decreasing by a fixed percentage and was verified in some preliminary simulations 2 4 sensitivity analysis plan we used a morris screening analysis morris 1991 as a feasible approach given the number of parameters we had to analyze the long running time of the simulation and our access to datarmor ifremer s supercomputer the advantage of the morris method is that one obtains information for both the main effects linear effects and the non linear effects and or interactions although one is not able to distinguish between non linear effects and interactions like more comprehensive decomposition of variance methods with the morris method the parameter space is turned into a grid by discretizing the space into a user defined number of subintervals the more subintervals the finer the evaluation of non linearities will be though possibly at the cost of a thorough exploration of the space one follows a set of trajectories through parameter space each trajectory starts with a random point in parameter space and then each step consists of moving one parameter in turn from a set of trajectories the elementary effects ee can be calculated that is the changes in the output measure for a relative change in the input parameter the standard set of metrics calculated from the elementary effects morris 1991 are µi the mean of the ee the average change in output across all changes to the parameter i which gives the sensitivity of output to input i due to all first and higher order effects and σi the standard deviation of ee the variance in how much the output changes in response to changes in the parameter i which indicates interactions and or non linearities in addition the metric µi is similar to µi except the absolute value is first applied to the ee before the mean is taken i e the average absolute value of change in output across all changes to parameter i which is useful for the sensitivity of the parameter independent of cancelling out effects if the direction of the change in output is not always consistent campolongo et al 2007 furthermore we used the intervals of σ µ established by sanchez et al 2014 to classify parameter effects into different zones almost linear σ µ 0 1 monotonic 0 1 σ µ 0 5 almost monotonic 0 5 σ µ 1 and markedly non monotonic or with interactions σ µ 1 and these zones are demarcated in the figures we performed two morris sas both of which used 50 trajectories at the high end of recommended ranges for the number of trajectories saltelli et al 2004 campolongo et al 2007 8 levels for each parameter including upper and lower bounds with values uniformly distributed between them and the recommended grid jump of 4 how many levels the parameter changes for a step in the trajectory the 50 trajectories were selected from a candidate set of 200 trajectories as the most orthogonal and thereby best spanning the parameter space campolongo et al 2007 because computing resources are often limited and other models have even longer running times we also considered the impact of using fewer trajectories 10 20 30 and 40 trajectories by performing a bootstrap test with 100 sampled trajectory sets for each size to compare with the results from all 50 trajectories we compared the estimation of µ and σ for the top five parameters for as well as the agreement in order of the top ten parameters between each subset and the full trajectory set we created the sa plan and calculated the resulting ee using the morris method in the sensitivity r package iooss et al 2019 we ran the full set of simulations on the datarmor supercomputer we performed an initial sa sa1 with the full parameter set of 90 parameters with 4550 simulations from the results of sa1 we first investigated the crashing simulations 9 trajectories then analyzed the morris metrics µ µ σ for the non crashing i e complete trajectories 41 trajectories based on the results of that analysis we determined that the parameters implicated in the crashing simulations and those with the most important effects were the parameters of the fixed recruitment top predator groups and the plankton groups see table a 4 for a complete list of parameters in each analysis and values for each level thus the complete sa is described in three steps 1 analysis of parameter values and combinations with extreme effect i e those that crash the model in sa1 2 analysis of parameter effects for the trajectories without crashing simulations for sa1 and 3 analysis of parameter effects in sa2 for the core food web excluding top predator and plankton groups for all the analyses we ran the simulations for 100 years enough time for the calibrated model to reach a steady state and then took as outputs the average biomass for the last 10 years of the simulation years 91 100 for the 40 groups in the model note that not all parameter combinations in the sa allow the system to reach a steady state and we also analyzed the system stability as discussed below for the 21 vertebrate groups we also examined the average number of individuals for the last 10 years of the simulation these outputs are used during calibration and offer good insight into the system state in order to summarize the effects of a parameter for the system in addition to its effect on each group individually we examined total biomass excluding detrital and bacteria groups and total numbers for vertebrates note that this does weight more massive or abundant groups higher but total biomass numbers is a commonly used metric and we also report results for individual groups finally we also looked at the stability of the system by examining how many groups achieved equilibrium in the last ten years of the simulation an important criterion for model calibration any group that had a biomass 0 1 t functionally extinct in the last ten years was defined to be non stable as well as all groups in crashing simulations for the rest we fit a linear model to the last ten years of biomass values for each group and defined stability as the regression line staying within 5 of the mean biomass of the last ten years this criteria is more flexible than simply examining the significance of the slope coefficient possibly significant even for very small changes in biomass or a strict window approach frequently not met by plankton and recycling groups which exhibit cyclic behavior even at equilibrium but still detects groups that continue to increase or decrease at the end of the simulation note that we are simply looking for any steady state not that the groups reach equilibrium at a specific value as in model calibration we examined the influence of parameters on system stability by calculating the morris metrics on the output of the percent of groups stable in the simulations all analysis was performed using r 3 6 0 r core team 2019 we used atlantis version trunk rev 6290 3 results 3 1 step 1 crashing simulations and stability in sa1 crashing simulations of the 4550 simulations in sa1 244 simulations crashed affecting 9 of the trajectories in atlantis simulations crash when any flux reaches a fixed threshold in our simulations the cause of the crash was the same in all cases an accumulation of too much detrital matter to be processed in the epibenthic layer which was due to a population explosion in some groups and extinction in others we determined that the crashes were due to a combination of low juvenile linear mortality rate and high reproduction rate for toothed cetaceans cet appendix b with no density dependence or trophic control for this top predator which uses fixed recruitment this leads to a population explosion stability an average of 69 range 0 95 of groups were stable across all simulations including those that crashed which were considered unstable and in 6 of simulations there were no groups stable fig 2 like with the results for the crashing simulations cetacean juvenile mortality and recruitment rates were extremely influential for determining system stability fig 3 c the juvenile mortality and recruitments rates for seabirds sb and seals sxx were also influential for system stability as were phytoplankton pp and zooplankton zoo growth rates 3 2 step 2 trajectories without crashes in sa1 parameters that had strong main effects high µ values also tended to have strong interaction and or nonlinear effects high σ values both for total biomass and numbers fig 3 and for individual groups fig b 2 generally seabirds seals and especially toothed cetacean parameters as well as those of phytoplankton and zooplankton had the strongest effects fig 3 including important effects across many groups figs 4 b 2 while all parameters influenced at least one group s biomass most groups biomass was strongly affected by a small subset of parameters figs 4 b 2 recruitment parameters generally that of the same group were also important to explain individual vertebrate groups numbers fig b 3 b 4 appendix b we next discuss the effects of the most influential parameters those of plankton and fixed recruitment top predators on biomass for all other groups the parameter effects can be broadly divided into three categories 1 those with moderate to strong effects across many groups biomass primarily consisting of the growth and mortality rates for benthic invertebrates 2 those with strong effects on their own group but no other groups which was true for many parameters generally growth and mortality rates for invertebrates and growth and recruitment rates for vertebrates and finally 3 those with weak or little effect mostly vertebrate mortality rates other than top predators with fixed recruitment top predator growth and adult mortality rates and some primary production parameters fig 4 these other groups are examined in more detail in sa2 3 2 1 plankton production parameters the growth rate parameters of phytoplankton and zooplankton had strong effects on nearly all groups biomass demonstrating bottom up effects fig 4 fig b 2 the direction of the effect was consistent increasing the phytoplankton growth rate had a strong positive effect and that of zooplankton a strong negative effect fig 4 center panel in fact the only groups biomass not strongly influenced were the bird and mammal top predators using fixed recruitment that were driven solely by their own parameters as well as cephalopods cep and refractory detritus dr biomass which were mostly affected by seabird and cetacean parameters the effects of zooplankton mortality rates on biomass were also broad though less consistent in direction of effect within some groups i e µ small compared to µ indicating the sign of the effect varied across simulations for that group carnivorous zoc and gelatinous zog zooplankton parameters as well as phytoplankton s mortality parameter generally had little effect across groups biomass the effects of lower trophic level parameters on was stronger on biomass than vertebrate numbers appendix b 3 2 2 top predator parameters the recruitment and mortality parameters of top predators with fixed recruitment seabirds seals and particularly toothed cetaceans strongly influenced the biomass of nearly all groups fig 4 b 2 the only groups relatively unaffected by these parameters were each other s biomass and that of planktons and scallops sce furthermore these effects are likely understated due to the removal of trajectories with crashing simulations which were found to be due to specific toothed cetacean parameter combinations this interplay between parameters could play a role in the strong interaction nonlinear effects large σ observed the direction of the effect µ varied by group while model crashes were only observed from toothed cetacean parameters with low mortality and high recruitment some combinations of sea bird and seal parameters also caused their biomass to increase exponentially in some simulations and correspondingly many of their prey species went extinct the juvenile mortality parameter appears to be the most sensitive in the case of juvenile toothed cetacean mortality parameters any increase above the baseline value always resulted in their own extinction while decreases from the baseline value resulted in a range of outcomes from extinction to exponential growth the situation was similar but less extreme for sea bird and seal parameters and the direction of the effect was less consistent the effects of these population explosions and resulting extinctions can also be seen through the importance of top predator recruitment and mortality parameters on vertebrate numbers appendix b 3 3 step 3 core food web in sa2 removing the most influential parameters from sa1 those of top predators with fixed recruitment and plankton table 1 focused the sa on the parameters for the core of the food web with the system generally in a stable state i e without the extinctions and exponential growth that characterized many simulations in sa1 for total biomass of the system the growth rates and to a lesser extent mortality rates of benthic invertebrates had the strongest influence while total vertebrate numbers were primarily driven by the parameters of the most numerous groups fig 5 we next discuss the influential parameters for system stability and groups biomass in more detail there were fewer influential parameters for vertebrate numbers than for biomass and a group s own recruitment rate was the most important appendix b 3 3 1 stability stability was considerably higher in sa2 than sa1 with an average of 95 range 80 100 groups stable and all 40 groups were stable in12 of simulations fig 2 with the narrower range of stability in sa2 there was a gradient of effect of the various parameters on the system stability though deposit feeder mortality was the most influential while clupeidae clu quadratic mortality the least fig 5 thus all the parameters had some influence on the stability of the system in non linear and or interacting ways 3 3 2 biomass the most influential parameters on total biomass were the growth rates of benthic invertebrates such as echinoderms ech bivalves biv deposit feeders dep scallops and suspension feeders sus and to a lesser extent some of these groups mortality rates fig 5 and these same parameters are also important across numerous individual groups biomass figs 6 b 5 the biomasses of plankton and recycling groups which did not have their parameters modified in sa2 were strongly influenced by nearly every parameter while the direction of effect for these parameters was generally inconsistent fig 6 and with strong non linear interaction effects fig b 5 groups differed in how linear or non linear the impact of influential parameters was on their biomass likely due to different positions in the food web fig b 5 for example the impact of most parameters was clearly non monotonic or with interactions non linearities for the biomass of cephalopods echinoderms lobsters lbe pollack pol suspension feeders and whelk whe on the contrary the biomass of pelagics and their predators that is clupeids mackerels sparidae cetaceans sea birds and seals responded to parameters in a more linear way probably because of the weaker influence of benthic compartments most groups biomass was primarily influenced by between two and ten parameters their own and those of several other groups figs 6 and b 5 the other group s parameters were generally those of the more abundant vertebrate and invertebrate groups and were frequently but not always prey of the affected group groups biomass being influenced by their predators parameters on the other hand was more rare and only tended to occur with the biomass of groups at the lowest tropic level finally there were a handful of groups affected almost solely by their own parameters clupeidae mackerels mac scallops and sharks shk these groups except for sharks have a plankton detritus diet in common the parameters of which were not changed in sa2 however suspension feeders share a similar diet but their biomass was also influenced by their predators parameters the food web interactions can be seen through the direction of the effect fig 6 µ columns for example bivalve s growth rate had a generally positive impact on other groups biomass except for phytoplankton prey and suspension feeders competition similarly deposit feeder s growth rate had a generally positive effect on other groups biomass except for their prey and competitors while the growth rate of echinoderms almost universally negatively affected other groups biomass except phytoplankton for nearly all vertebrate groups biomass as well as larger invertebrates like shrimp shp lobsters and cephalopods the groups parameters strongly influenced that same group s biomass but had little effect on the biomass of other groups excepting plankton and recycling groups influenced by all or most parameters as noted above the parameters for clupeidae and to a lesser extent whiting whg both of which are numerous in the system had a strong influence on the biomass of top bird and mammal predators for which they are an important food source but little influence on their benthic prey interestingly only seal biomass was also influenced by a number of other fish groups parameters reflecting diet differences mortality parameters were generally less influential than growth rate 3 4 sa1 and sa2 summary to summarize the most important results of the sa strong main effects of parameters tended to go hand in hand with strong interaction and or nonlinear effects and all parameters influenced system stability the strongest effects were due to fixed recruitment top predators particularly the juvenile mortality and reproduction rates and plankton particularly phytoplankton and zooplankton growth rates there was also high sensitivity to benthos parameters particularly growth rate across nearly all groups each group s biomass tended to be highly sensitive to 2 10 parameters their own and more commonly their prey than their predators vertebrate numbers were most often linearly influenced by a group s own recruitment rate 3 5 number of trajectories 3 5 1 sa1 in general µ and σ estimates for the most influential parameters for most groups in sa1 were robust with respect to the number of trajectories figs b 8 b 9 exceptions were parameters affecting fixed recruitment top predators phytoplankton bacteria and detrital groups where smaller estimations of effect size were likely with fewer trajectories furthermore interaction nonlinear effects of the recruitment and mortality parameters of fixed recruitment top predators were smaller for numerous groups perhaps more important is the relative ordering of the most important parameters which was in agreement on average of 82 for µ and 72 for σ even for only 10 trajectories across all groups and numbers of trajectories the agreement in ordering the most influential parameters was higher for µ than σ demonstrating the increased difficulty in estimating the non linear interaction effects fig b 10 3 5 2 sa2 the error with estimating sa metrics with fewer trajectories was greatly reduced in sa2 with greater system stability figs b 11 b 12 the agreement for ordering the most influential parameters was generally quite good except for some bacteria detrital and plankton groups whose parameters were not included in sa2 fig b 15 across all groups the agreement averaged 87 for µ and 80 for σ for 10 trajectories increasing to 95 and 93 respectively for 40 trajectories 4 discussion while sa has long been recognized as an important part of ecological model development scott 1996 shaeffer d l 1980 thornton et al 1979 it has generally been neglected for atlantis models but see hansen et al 2019 kaplan et al 2012 ortega cisnerosa et al 2017 sturludottir et al 2018 due to computational challenges with long run times and technical challenges with the large number of parameters we demonstrate the feasibility of a large scale sa on a complex ecosystem model and illustrate a number of ways to accommodate a large number of parameters first even if computationally feasible the sheer number of parameters in atlantis means a complete sa on all parameters would be uninterpretable and thus some pre selection of parameters must take place in this paper we focused on the growth recruitment and mortality parameters most frequently adjusted during calibration but other approaches are possible such as examining the diet matrix morzaria luna et al 2018 choosing parameters to determine where the most improvement could be found through improved data collection lebauer et al 2013 or with an eye to uncertainty analysis to quantify the impact of parameter uncertainty on output variability cariboni et al 2007 another important technique we utilized was collapsing many valued age structured parameters with a function utilizing a hyperparameter that was manipulated in the sa additionally we moved correlated parameters together which both reduced the number of parameters to consider in the sa and maintained ecological coherence among the set of parameters using a morris screening sa allowed us to perform a global analysis with relatively few simulations and thus differentiate effects as approximately linear monotonic or nonlinear interactions finally like morzaria luna et al 2018 our analysis would not have been possible without access to supercomputer resources and we suggest these resources are generally essential to carrying out sas of complex ecosystem models furthermore we suggest that these advances imply that new atlantis model implementations should incorporate sa in the model development as suggested by modeling guidelines cariboni et al 2007 and which have already started being carried out hansen et al 2019 4 1 interesting insights about the atlantis eec model our results highlight a difficulty raised by patus 2007 that finding parameters that are less sensitive and thus can be ignored in models that contain cyclic feedbacks like atlantis is perhaps unrealistic our results generally confirm this bearing in mind that we selected the parameters most frequently tuned during calibration and thus already known to be sensitive there could certainly be insensitive parameters among the many remaining parameters in atlantis while there are perhaps only a handful of more influential parameters for any given group the effects were almost never strictly linear and frequently show evidence of nonlinear interaction effects in addition every parameter was influential for at least one group illustrating why all parameters were important for system stability although in sa1 there were some growth and mortality parameters that had little effect on biomass across all groups fig 4 and a subset of those that had little effect on numbers fig b 3 these parameters did still affect system stability furthermore for those parameters that were also included in sa2 all appear to influence biomass at least interact with numbers and especially contribute to system stability fig 5 with that caveat the least influential parameters were adult mortality and growth rates for vertebrates with fixed recruitment juvenile mortality rate for some vertebrates with bh recruitment cephalopod growth rate growth and mortality rates for gelatinous zooplankton and phytoplankton mortality rate the lack of influence of the phytoplankton mortality rate was particularly striking given the strong effects of phytoplankton growth rates and of both growth and mortality rates for zooplankton the importance of both top down and bottom up effects is evident with the most influential parameters these include those of top predators with fixed recruitment i e toothed cetaceans sea birds seals and illustrate a structural issue with the atlantis eec model these top predators are not density dependent either through their recruitment or mortality allowing them to increase exponentially that is they reproduce through pups rather than a self limiting bh recruitment function and like other vertebrates in the model with the exception of clupeidae they have no quadratic mortality furthermore they are not impacted by the fishery and experience little predation themselves these groups are thus very sensitive to their parameterization particularly the reproduction rate and the juvenile mortality rate which can quickly shift the population from extinction to unrealistic exponential growth to dampen these effects different values of starvation mortality currently underutilized in atlantis models pethybridge et al 2019 should be explored in the atlantis eec model to better represent competition among top predators and the effects of limited food in addition unfished top predators modeled with atlantis could be controlled by a quadratic mortality term and or a modified fecundity using the ratio of reserve to structural nitrogen additionally the lack of starvation mortality likely explains the decoupling observed between biomass and numbers in vertebrates biomass and number do not react the same way numbers are primarily determined by a group s own reproduction parameter and top predator parameters in sa1 which drove extinctions while biomass is determined by individual weights that depend on growth rates and prey abundance thus it is possible to have large numbers of individuals at below normal weights who do not die at increased rates this makes numbers less sensitive to trophic network effects than biomass bottom up control was emphasized by the other extremely sensitive parameters the growth rates of phytoplankton and zooplankton hansen et al 2019 also found the strongest effects in response to changing the growth rates for zooplankton groups while the sa performed by ortega cisneros et al 2017 only included the growth rate of phytoplankton and zooplankton they also observed large effects throughout the food web particularly on phytoplankton and zooplankton themselves and small pelagic fish though large pelagic fish were less sensitive sturludottir et al 2018 found a strong response to phytoplankton growth rate but not macrozooplankton growth rate though other zooplankton groups were not included this sensitivity to plankton dynamics has also been found in other ecosystem models steele and ruzicka 2011 reflecting the importance of both primary producers to bottom up forcing as well as the role of zooplankton in linking trophic levels carlotti and poggiale 2010 rose et al 2010 however this importance of plankton dynamics also highlights a challenge of parameterizing end to end ecosystem models given data limitations for plankton communities this is further complicated by the fact that for reasons of the relatively coarse spatiotemporal scale the plankton dynamics are represented with less detail in comparison with existing npz models baretta et al 1995 butenschön et al 2016 kishi et al 2007 schrum et al 2006 the universal positive effect of a higher phytoplankton growth rate on all groups is unsurprising but the opposite universally negative effect of a higher zooplankton growth rate even for zooplankton itself is striking and counterintuitive there are several possible reasons first atlantis does not explicitly model the larval stage for fish the option for phytoplankton and or zooplankton abundance to affect recruitment is not utilized in the atlantis eec model which depend heavily on zooplankton last 1978a 1978b however zooplankton makes up the majority of the diet 80 99 for mackerels clupeidae which both migrate outside the system carnivorous zooplankton and gelatinous zooplankton as well as a significant portion of the diet 5 20 for mulgilidae shrimps and zooplankton itself more likely a higher zooplankton growth rate causes the zooplankton to increase and consume all the phytoplankton which then cannot regrow i e the extreme case of lotka voltera dynamics no oscillation this would cut off the pelagic pathway and could cut off the benthic pathway in the ecosystem as many benthic invertebrates are planktivores and phytoplankton is particularly important in the diet of suspension feeders and scallops finally an increase in the zooplankton growth rate might divert energy from the detrital benthic pathway by consuming plankton that would otherwise die and so could contribute the negative response seen across groups even in relatively simple npz models where multiple functional forms are used for zooplankton grazing e g eq 1 this relationship is known to be problematic and a strong determinant of system dynamics franks 2002 examining the direction of the effects µ of different parameters elucidates the complex food web dynamics captured in the atlantis eec model the inconsistent direction of effects of top predator parameters demonstrates indirect effects that is negative effects on their prey s biomass but positive effects on the biomass of their prey s prey while fixed recruitment top predators do appear to structure the entire ecosystem in the sense of a trophic cascade paine 1980 ripple et al 2016 in sa1 this is not the case under more stable conditions in sa2 where we saw weaker effects of upper trophic level predators parameters on other groups biomass in the system for example the parameters of the more abundant predators such as whiting and other gadidae gad had little effect on their benthic prey s biomass rather the most influential parameters were those of the invertebrate benthic groups particularly the growth rates thus confirming the bottom up dynamics of the system the sa thus supported our hypothesis of important effect from benthic parameters based on the strong bentho pelagic coupling in the system and this would be interesting to confirm with a more thorough validation analysis of the model the eec ecosystem is a shallow continental shelf sea driven by benthic productivity dauvin and desroy 2005 desroy et al 2003 garcia et al 2011 the food web structure is comprised of benthic and pelagic pathways and the bentho pelagic coupling increases in shallow coastal areas where both benthic and pelagic sources are easily available kopp et al 2015 benthic sources make up the majority of the diet for all trophic groups ranging from just over 50 for even pelagic piscivorous fish to 100 for groups such as benthic predators and demersal piscivorous fish giraldo et al 2017 furthermore this importance of benthos to eec ecosystem functioning has also been found with a variety of modeling approaches daskalov et al 2011 girardin et al 2018 travers trolet et al 2019 4 2 implications for other atlantis models although some insights are specific to the precise formulation of the atlantis eec model girardin et al 2018 such as its trophic and physical structure there is also learning that could apply to other atlantis implementations new atlantis implementations continue to be developed weijerman et al 2016a and calibration of these models is a challenging undertaking the results of this sa can provide additional information to complement existing advice for how to approach calibration audzijonyte et al 2019 pethybridge et al 2019 while we were unable to find a simple list of parameters with minimal effects across all groups this is unsurprising given that we focused on a subset of the most frequently calibrated parameters pethybridge et al 2019 and the known feedback interactions present in atlantis through the trophic structure pantus 2007 however there were still differences in the strength of effect among parameters one important distinction particularly when calibrating models is that between parameters that have a strong main effect on the outcomes of many or nearly all groups versus those parameters whose main effect is primarily on the group itself while the ubiquity of nonlinear interaction effects means there are no parameters that are strictly limited to only influencing their own groups there are clear differences in the degree of interactions the strong contribution of the plankton parameters to system stability and the determination of most groups biomass suggests a useful approach is to first calibrate a simplified npz model pethybridge et al 2019 which was successfully applied for the calibration of the atlantis eec model girardin et al 2018 while the representation of lower trophic levels in atlantis is necessarily coarse given its spatial and temporal resolution pethybridge et al 2019 it is still likely that a subset of these groups will be highly influential for the entire system though which subset appears to be model dependent ortega cisneros et al 2017 hansen et al 2019 sturludottir et al 2018 further the large influence of fixed recruitment top predator parameters on system stability despite those groups comparatively small biomass suggests that it is essential to set parameters for these groups approximately correctly early in the calibration process there was hardly any interaction between fixed recruitment top predator and plankton parameters suggesting the lowest and highest trophic levels could be calibrated sequentially once the highest and lowest trophic levels are stabilized i e sa2 many parameter interactions fall into the monotonic or almost monotonic zone for individual outputs though not total system biomass or stability one surprising discovery was the relatively localized and monotonic effect of manipulating bh recruitment bhalpha with only the group itself affected and no other parameters contributing in most cases in these groups generally fish nonlinear interaction effects were more prevalent with growth and mortality parameters in general growth rates were more important than mortality rates for determining biomass though mortality rates appeared important for controlling system stability for vertebrate groups this may be because most mortality is captured through predation and fishing mortality while mortality rates were more important for invertebrate groups they were still less important than growth rates and this may be due to natural mortality rates being low for invertebrates in the baseline model for context nearly all vertebrate mortality rates that were not zero were above the 1e 5 day 1 threshold pethybridge et al 2019 consider high additional mortality while nearly all invertebrate mortality rates other than plankton were below the threshold groups whose parameters were important to other groups tended to be the most abundant benthic invertebrates and planktivorous fish while it is unclear how much these results depend on the specific trophic network and environment of the atlantis eec model we can make some preliminary suggestions on the order in which to tackle groups within the context of other advice on calibrating atlantis models audzijonyte et al 2019 pethybridge et al 2019 that is 1 calibrate the plankton and recycling groups perhaps as a simplified npz model 2 ensure reasonable avoiding extinction or exponential growth mortality and recruitment rates of fixed or constant recruitment groups generally top predators 3 adjust growth rates of non age structured groups 4 adjust growth rates of age structured groups focusing on high abundance groups 5 adjust mortality rates as needed for stability 6 adjust bh recruitment to match numbers 7 continue to iteratively fine tune groups furthermore if resources are available we suggest that once reasonable starting points for parameters are identified a sa even with few trajectories can be very useful for calibration efforts an important consideration for performing a sa on an atlantis model is what resources are available given the long simulation running times our results indicate that useful information can still be obtained even from many fewer trajectories than the 50 we used here while some form of parallelization would still be essential this may not necessarily require access to a supercomputer there are several considerations with using relatively few trajectories in a highly parameterized and complex model suggested by our analysis most importantly interaction nonlinear effects are likely to be underestimated particularly with very small trajectory samples in general while the effect sizes may vary with smaller numbers of trajectories the approximate ordering of parameters was still fairly accurate these issues may be accentuated if the system frequently becomes unstable in the sa simulations i e groups exploding or going extinct crashes so that repeating the sa in that context may not give consistent results while a sa generally provides information on how much each parameter influences the output an uncertainty analysis ua focuses rather on how much the results are influenced by the uncertainty of the inputs ua comprises a broader context than a sa for example link et al 2012 list six major categories of uncertainty in ecosystem models natural variability observation error inadequate communication among scientists decision makers and stakeholders model structural complexity outcome uncertainty and unclear management objectives uas of complex ecosystem models are also relatively rare uas can highlight how uncertainty in parameter specification translates to uncertainty in model outputs morzaria luna et al 2018 and cross model comparisons can give insight into the effects of uncertainty in process specification fulton et al 2003 smith et al 2015 investigating model uncertainty is a current focus of the atlantis community weijerman et al 2016a our results suggest that one possible starting point would be to include uncertainty in the plankton dynamics as these tend to be data poor particularly zooplankton dynamics and phytoplankton species composition but also influential to system stability and dynamics zooplankton are a key feature of end to end ecosystem models linking lower and upper trophic levels as compared to npz models which focus on biogeochemical cycling or multispecies fish models with simplified representations rose et al 2010 other parameters to consider in a ua scenario could be determined from uncertainty based on the data pedigree pethybridge et al 2019 combined with information from a sa like the one presented here this analysis could be limited to or weighted by the key groups depending on the scenario investigated e g commercially important or threatened species this would allow comparing the magnitude of impact on output of model uncertainties and management alternatives as well as propagating uncertainty in the analysis 4 3 future directions while comprehensive the current sa is still only a first step in understanding the sensitivity of the atlantis eec model to its input parameters here we covered the most frequently calibrated growth mortality and recruitment parameters which are not known precisely but for which some insight is available other parameters which could be crucial but which are rarely changed in atlantis models such as assimilation efficiency or environmental response functions like temperature dependent growth would be interesting to explore future analyses could also take into account how the fishing fleets are parameterized and how the predator prey diet availability matrix is defined earlier work has already demonstrated how species life history traits drive responses to fishing pressure kaplan et al 2012 furthermore an uncertainty analysis of the diet availability matrix showed great variation in the biomass and catch predicted as well as provided a possible framework for conducting a sa of the diet availability matrix morzaria luna et al 2018 finally the sensitivity to model structure such as which functional response or recruitment relationship is used could be important we considered the direct outputs of biomass and vertebrate numbers as well as system stability but future analyses could also include additional outputs like size at age for vertebrates realized diet or consider the outputs spatially rather than aggregated here our aim was two fold to gain insight into model functioning and to provide guidance for calibration therefore we used biomass and numbers as our outputs of interest in order to more precisely inform an automated calibration the sensitivity of the objective function of could also be investigated indeed 1 depending on the formulation of the of other parameters than those affecting absolute biomass and numbers may be shown to be influential and 2 it is worth exploring the sensitivity of alternative formulations of the of beforehand to ensure responsiveness automatic calibration has been successfully implemented for other ecosystem models such as osmose duboz et al 2010 and nemuro rose et al 2007 but has not yet been attempted for an atlantis model a successful automatic calibration framework for atlantis models would provide advantages such as reducing the time necessary to calibrate the model and providing an objective common ground for calibrating different implementations of the model given the complexity and highly parameterized nature of atlantis substantial uncertainty may remain in the parameters that should be characterized and a unique set of parameter values may not be obtained janssen and heuberger 1995 furthermore a sequential calibration approach like that used with osmose may be helpful conducting sas across other atlantis model implementations would allow better understanding of whether parameter sensitivities are due to structural design of the atlantis model locale specific environmental or trophic network effects or perhaps even common trophic structures across models sas of atlantis models including this one have consistently found plankton growth parameters to be important drivers of biomass across groups hansen et al 2019 ortega cisneros et al 2017 sturludottir et al 2018 in particular we recommend the morris screening method morris 1991 as well suited to the complexity and long running time of atlantis models it provides the ability to gain information on nonlinear interaction effects with no linearity assumptions of the model but with the number of simulations required still on the order of a simple oat analysis saltelli and annoni 2010 and has been successfully applied to other end to end marine ecosystem models morris et al 2014 more and more thorough sas across a variety of atlantis models may also allow the simplification of some model processes fulton et al 2003 van nes and scheffer 2005 credit authorship contribution statement chloe bracis conceptualization

24788,the q10 temperature coefficient which is widely used in scientific literature is a measure of the temperature sensitivity of chemical reaction rates or biological processes however the conclusions drawn from applying this coefficient to experimental data obtained from biological processes are not universal in many biological processes q10 values are often discordant with the results predicted by the arrhenius law the hypothesis tested in the present study is that this problem arises mainly from the fact that the q10 coefficient is defined by the ratio between rates described by

1953 blehrádek hegarty has been widely described in the literature as a measure of the degree of temperature dependence of a given chemical or biological process it is usually defined as the rate ratio of a given process taking place at temperatures differing by 10 units or k however conclusions drawn by different researchers from the use of this coefficient are not universal wang et al 2006 carey and are not always consistent with each other abele et al 2002 alcaraz et al 2012 barclay 2005 bennett 1984 carrasquel ursulaez et al 2015 chang et al 2013 clark et al 2013 clarke 2004 clarke

2017 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 park et al davidson et al kramshøj et al wood et al therefore it is reasonable to presume that this problem arises from the fact that the q 10 coefficient is defined by the ratio between rates described by exponential laws instead of power laws which leads to deviations from linearity in the arrhenius plots this hypothesis may be tested in experiments conducted by several research groups abdelsayed et al 2018 barton and yvon durocher 2019 han and jin 2018 hoyt et al 2019 magnabosco et al 2018 makhnykina et al 2018 wudarski et al 2019 in these cases a temperature increase by 10 units does not entail the doubling or tripling of the rate of a given process as is usually assumed in the relevant literature heskel et al 2016 based on this hypothesis an alternative model is proposed that generalises the q 10 coefficient and unifies the conflicting results obtained by researchers overall the primary objective of the present study was to demonstrate that the rates of chemical or biological processes do not obey exponential laws arrhenius law therefore a review of the standard definition of the q 10 coefficient is required 2 methodology 2 1 usual arrhenius model the usual model for the q 10 coefficient is expressed by the following equation 1 q 10 k t 2 k t 1 10 t 2 t 1 where t is the temperature in celsius degrees or kelvin and k is the rate constant expressed as exponential decay with temperature commonly expressed by the arrhenius equation k a e e o r t where a eo and r are the frequency factor activation energy of a reaction and ideal gas constant respectively 2 2 deformed arrhenius model the proposed mathematical model is based on the theory of deformed exponential functions aquilanti et al 2010 wikipedia 2019 following this definition the new arrhenius rate equation is defined as following 2 k d t a 1 d e o r t 1 d it is straightforward to verify that using eq 2 and in according to the iupac definition the new activation energy equation is given by 3 e a e o 1 d e o r t 1 using eqs 1 and 2 the new q d10 coefficient is given by 4 q d 10 k d t 2 k d t 1 10 t 2 t 1 k t lim d 0 k d t and q 10 lim d 0 q d 10 which render a possible generalisation of rates and q 10 coefficients the algebraic sign of the d parameter controls the functional behaviour of the generalized arrhenius law d 0 gives rise to a concave or sub arrhenius behaviour d 0 to a convex or super arrhenius and at d 0 the conventional linear arrhenius form is attained fig 1 a shows the behaviour of the q d10 coefficient as a function of the deformation parameter assuming that the activation energy eo is a constant in the limit case in which d 0 k t 10 k t 2 i e the rate doubles with every 10 degree variation in temperature as predicted by the usual theory tveit et al but in general d 0 non arrhenius see fig 1 the rate ratio can take any value chen and chen 2018 nottingham et al 2019 wang et al watanabe et al huey et al marsay et al terhzaz et al in this new model the q d10 values are also a function of the activation energy eo as shown in fig 1 b these deviations from arrhenius like behaviour is intimately linked to the development of new technologies that enabled the investigation of natural phenomena within a wide range of temperature between 10 k and 600 k aquilanti et al 2018 gao et al 2018 limbach et al 2006 van dishoeck 2017 which was not possible in past decades additionally we propose a new code with a user friendly graphical interface fig 2 able to perform different procedures for computing q 10 and others properties as temperature dependent the code is referred to as q d10gsa that works with concepts relates to the diffusion process or rates eq 2 activation energy eq 3 and q 10 coefficient eq 4 written in python it is a free open source code compatible with windows linux and macos platforms it offers the possibility of estimating phenomenological parameters from arrhenius and d arrhenius plots using the stochastic optimization method generalized simulated annealing gsa dall igna júnior et al 2004 de andrade et al 2008 mundim and tsallis 1996 simulated annealing methods have been used successfully in the description of a variety of global extremization problems simulated annealing methods have attracted significant attention due to their suitability for large scale optimization problems especially for those in which a desired global minimum is hidden among many local minima the basic aspect of the simulated annealing method is that it is analogous to thermodynamics especially concerning the way that liquids freeze and crystallize or that metals cool and anneal the first nontrivial solution along this line was provided by kirkpatrick et al kirkpatrick 1984 kirkpatrick et al for classical systems and also extended by ceperley and alder to quantum systems it strictly follows the quasi equilibrium boltzmann gibbs statistics using a gaussian visiting distribution and is sometimes referred to as classical simulated annealing csa or boltzmann machine the next interesting step in this subject was szu and hartley proposal szu and hartley 1987 to use a cauchy lorentz visiting distribution instead of a gaussian distribution this algorithm is referred to as fast simulated annealing fsa or cauchy machine in 1996 mundim and tsallis 1996 proposed a generalization approach referred to as generalized simulated annealing gsa moret et al 1998 2001 2002 used in this code we expect that this code serve as a quick and practical tool for data characterization from experimental data and different proposed models it presents a very intuitive graphical interface fig 2 which we believe to provide an excellent working tool for emphasize the need to generalize the usual q 10 approach 3 results and applications considering that the q 10 coefficient is widely used to describe a variety of phenomena including chemical kinetics aquilanti et

valid and q10 coefficient values are not consistent with the experimental data moreover it was shown that the theory proposed herein is in line with the experimental data especially in temperature ranges precluding the use of the ordinary formulation the cases addressed in the present study described below involve studying the effect of temperature on metabolic processes in living organisms soil carbon decomposition heart beat and consumption of oxygen and other chemical substances by plants and animals deformed arrhenius plots and activation energy in kj mol were used to standardise the distinct cases addressed in this study the ideal gas constant is r 8 314472 j k 1 m o l 1 3 1 effect of temperature on the metabolism of arctic zooplankton for the first application of the proposed model the results obtained by alcaraz et al 2012 were analysed these authors studied the effect of temperature on the metabolism of arctic zooplankton based on these experimental data the deformed rates kd were fitted to calculate the q d10 coefficient and the activation energy at different temperatures the results are shown in fig 3 a more specifically we assessed the temperature dependence with the rates of respiration and of phosphate and ammonia excretion as shown in fig 4 of reference alcaraz et al 2012 our model returned a sub arrhenius behaviour d 0 associated with the rates of respiration and ammonia excretion whereas the rate of phosphate excretion had a slightly super arrhenius behaviour with d 0 but close to zero because the values of the deformation parameters were not zero the activation energy ea of the reactions was temperature dependent fig 3b d unlike in the ordinary case in which ea is assumed to be constant for respiration and ammonia excretion processes the activation energy increased with increasing temperature fig 3b and 3c whereas in the phosphate excretion the scenario was inverted as the activation energy decreased with increasing temperature super arrhenius behaviour fig 3d additionally unlike the case of respiration process the activation energy in the excretion processes became practically constant at temperatures higher than 300 k and changed abruptly at low temperatures consequently the q d10 coefficients for the three rates decreased with increasing temperature in a non exponential manner d 0 as shown in fig 3a these results demonstrated that the metabolic rates of arctic zooplankton exhibit a nonlinear relationship with temperature in ln k 1 t moreover the metabolism of arctic zooplankton is highly sensitive to changes in temperature d 0 for both respiration and excretion thus nonlinear abrupt responses changes in regime and complex trajectories are to be expected during the evolution of these species the value of activation energy in the case of respiration fig 3b was not constant indicating a high sensitivity of the respiration process to changes in temperature contrastingly in the excretion processes fig 3c and 3d the activation energy was weakly dependent on temperature d 0 in the case of ammonia ne excretion increased with increasing temperature d 0 or sub arrhenius whereas in the case of phosphate the activation energy decreased with increasing temperature d 0 or super arrhenius in the small range of temperatures 273 k to 280 k used in the analysis temperature sensitivity given by the q d10 parameter exhibited an almost linear behaviour in the cases of respiration cr ammonia excretion ne and phosphate excretion pe as shown in fig 3e f 3 2 temperature sensitivity of processes in soil organic carbon soc decomposition several studies eswaran et al 1993 hararuk et al 2015 kirschbaum 2006 lal 2004 lloyd and taylor 1994 mukherjee et al 2013 tang et al 2017 wang et al 2005 yan et al 2017 yang et al 2017 davidson et al kramshøj et al koven et al have recently raised questions regarding the reliability of the usual methods to characterise the temperature sensitivity of processes occurring during soil organic carbon soc decomposition currently the q 10 coefficient is frequently used as a measure to infer the effect of temperature on soc decomposition considering soc decomposition as a multifactorial problem and focusing solely on the influence of temperature on this phenomenon the q 10 coefficient in its usual form is not an adequate measuring parameter because it is defined as the ratio between rates that are assumed a priori as being exponential functions of temperature k a e e o r t therefore ln k 1 t should be linear which contradicts the experimental data obtained by yan et al 2017 and tang et al 2017 these experimental data were reviewed within the q d10 model and the results are shown in fig 4 and 5 to contribute to a better understanding of these problems the influence of temperature on soc decomposition was studied using the proposed model eqs 2 4 which is essential to predict the impact of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems this is because soc contains approximately three times as much carbon as the terrestrial vegetation and twice as much as the atmosphere and because global warming has already noticeably affected the environment yan et al 2017 as previously mentioned the usual form of assessing the importance of temperature in the degradation process is via the q 10 coefficient moreover the results obtained through the standard model are uncertain one of the major factors causing this uncertainty is the temperature sensitivity q 10 t in the process of soc decomposition this was observed in the cases addressed below which required a reformulation of the q 10 t coefficient calculation method this was also one of the main objectives of this study the present study was based on the results obtained by yan et al 2017 and by tang et al 2017 to which the new q 10 model was fitted in these studies the authors estimated the differences in soc decomposition and temperature sensitivity between different soil samples in forested areas as well as between superficial soils and subsoil layers in cropland systems the application of the proposed model to soc decomposition showed that the soil respiration rates analysed by yan et al 2017 did not vary exponentially with temperature see fig 4d this implies a deviation from the usual arrhenius model because the deformation coefficients d were not zero in all the systems assessed in the study noticeably in the case of tl2 topsoil layer upland site 2 the process was of super arrhenius type or convex d 0 fig 4a and 4b and the activation energy was highly sensitive to temperature variations as shown in fig 4c in this process the behaviour of the new q d10 coefficient indicates a strong influence of temperature on soc decomposition this case is a classic example in which the standard definition of the q 10 coefficient does not apply the other three cases tl1 sl1 and sl2 exhibited almost linear sub arrhenius behaviour d 0 these results indicated that the respiration rate soc in the topsoil layer tl is more sensitive to temperature variations than that in the subsoil layer sl the q d10 coefficient in the upland tl case establishes a rate ratio of 3 5 k d t 2 k d t 1 9 0 between 7 30 c the fitting parameters are shown in table 1 3 3 temperature sensitivity in processes of soc decomposition in different types of soil in the same context tang et al 2017 investigated temperature sensitivity of soc decomposition in different types of soil surface of deciduous forest surface of semi arid grassland evergreen forest and tropical rainforest revisiting of these experimental results within the deformed arrhenius model eqs 2 4 demonstrated that the deformation coefficients were d 0 in all cases and were therefore characterised as being of the sub arrhenius type fig 5a c the obtained q d10 coefficients led to rate ratios of 1 95 k d t 2 k d t 1 2 40 between 12 32 c fig 5b these variations in decomposition rates induced a change in the activation energy to be temperature dependent as opposed to the standard model that assumes activation energy as being constant 3 4 temperature sensitivity in physiological reactions of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems physiological reaction rates particularly those of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems are strongly affected by body temperature schmidt nielsen 1984 stahl 1967 streicher et al 2012 weibel et al 1996 in the present study the influence of temperature on heart rate was investigated in the cockroach gromphadorhina portentosa using the new model for rates as proposed by streicher et al 2012 heart rates among this species do not vary exponentially with temperature and therefore the arrhenius plot does not apply in this case see fig 6 fig 6 shows respiration rate behaviour a the q d10 coefficient b and activation energy c the analysed reactions in this case can be classified as super arrhenius type d 0 and the activation energy was highly sensitive to temperature variation the q d10 coefficients exhibited a weakly nonlinear dependence on body temperature heart rate was less sensitive to temperature changes in the adult stage than in the other instars this is because the deformation parameter d is lower in the adult stage than in other phases of development the q d10 coefficient in both cases yielded a rate ratio of 2 k d t 2 k d t 1 2 2 between 280 305 k the rate variation with temperature fig 6d indicated a super arrhenius behaviour d 0 the fitting parameters are shown in table 2 3 5 convergence in the temperature response of leaf respiration across biomes and plant functional types plant respiration involves a massive flow of carbon to the atmosphere and a great control over the global carbon cycle heskel and collaborators heskel et al 2016 recently studied respiration in 231 plant species in seven biomes and concluded that the exponential models of respiration rates k t do not correctly describe the temperature sensitivity of k this means that ln k 1 t is not a linear function therefore the q10 coefficient must be reviewed in similar cases fig 7 a based on the results obtained by heskel et al 2016 this hypothesis was confirmed and ln k 1 t was shown to be of the super arrhenius type d 0 in both cases analysed by those authors in addition the q d10 coefficient fig 7b and activation energies fig 6c in the 0 20 c range changed abruptly with temperature temperate woodland biomes d 0 2257 were more sensitive to temperature changes than broadleaf deciduous temperate forests d 0 2173 in both the analysed cases the rate ratio was 1 6 k d t 2 k d t 1 2 6 between 15 40 c as shown in fig 7b these results indicate that the deformation parameter d is an indicator of thermal sensitivity in plant respiration i e sensitivity increases with increasing d 3 6 rate of oxygen consumption in mitochondria of the eurythermal killifish fundulus heteroclitus environmental temperature is an extremely important factor in processes involved in the metabolism of living organisms abele et al 2002 chang et al 2013 clark et al 2013 clarke 2004 clarke and fraser 2004 deban and lappin 2011 dell et al 2013 fangue et al 2009 gillooly et al 2006 halsey et al 2015 lake et al 2013 mccullough et al 1999 reyes et al 2008 schulte 2015 stanley 2010 wood et al raes et al in particular temperature plays an important role in the distribution and abundance of a species by affecting aerobic metabolism based on data obtained by schulte 2015 and fangue et al 2009 we now demonstrate that the rate of oxygen consumption in mitochondria of the eurythermal killifish fundulus heteroclitus cannot be described using the arrhenius law see fig 8 a in this case a deformation parameter d 0 indicates that ln k 1 t must be a nonlinear function of temperature and therefore the respiration rate does not decrease exponentially fig 8a shows the experimental data solid points the standard arrhenius plot dashed line and the model proposed herein solid line the respiration rate described by eq 2 fits perfectly to the experimental data with a deformation parameter of d 0 1982 which implies a rate of the super arrhenius type the q d10 coefficient indicates a rate ratio of 1 5 k d t 2 k d t 1 4 5 between 0 35 c as shown in fig 8b the activation energy changed abruptly below 0 c fig 8c these results indicated that the arrhenius law does not apply and is not predictive in the temperature region outside that established by the experimental data 4 discussion and conclusions the fitting quality of the new model in the analysed cases strengthens the initial hypothesis that the rates used in the definition of the q 10 temperature coefficient are described by power laws instead of exponential laws as established by the standard model the standard q 10 coefficient model is a particular case of the proposed model and validates its overall rationale however its applications and differentiated contexts require fitting the fitting quality of the new model to the experimental data is partly due to the flexibility of the deformed exponential function accomplished by the deformation parameter d in extreme cases at which d 0 then k t 10 k t 2 i e the rate doubles as the temperature increase by 10 units as predicted by the ordinary theory nevertheless in general cases d 0 and non arrhenius the rate ratio can be any positive value a consequence of this new model is that activation energy ea is temperature dependent unlike in the conventional models where ea is defined as constant the model proposed in the present study was successfully validated using data from experiments in which the usual arrhenius theory was shown to be insufficient considering that the ordinary model is a particular case of the proposed model and the quality of the results obtained in the various analysed cases it is suggested that there is a wider range of application for q d10 in the description of

carey and are not always consistent with each other abele et al 2002 alcaraz et al 2012 barclay 2005 bennett 1984 carrasquel ursulaez et al 2015 chang et al 2013 clark et al 2013 clarke 2004 clarke and fraser 2004 deban and lappin 2011 dell et al 2013 ding et al 2018 donley et al 2007 eswaran et al 1993 fangue et al 2009 gillooly et al 2006 halsey et al 2015 held et al 2015 helmuth et al 2004 holland and klein 1958 ito et al 2015 king et al 2006 kirschbaum 2006 lake et al 2013 lal 2004 laursen et al 2015 lin et al 2007 liu et al 2018 lloyd and taylor 1994 lombard1 et al 2009 mccullough et al 1999 raddatz et al 2014 reyes et al 2008 schulte 2015 stanley 2010 streicher et al 2012 tang et al 2017 taylor et al 1996 wang et al 2005 weibel et al 1996 wythers et al 2013 xiao 2000 yan et al 2017 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 park et al davidson et al kramshøj et al wood et al therefore it is reasonable to presume that this problem arises from the fact that the q 10 coefficient is defined by the ratio between rates described by exponential laws instead of power laws which leads to deviations from linearity in the arrhenius plots this hypothesis may be tested in experiments conducted by several research groups abdelsayed et al 2018 barton and yvon durocher 2019 han and jin 2018 hoyt et al 2019 magnabosco et al 2018 makhnykina et al 2018 wudarski et al 2019 in these cases a temperature increase by 10 units does not entail the doubling or tripling of the rate of a given process as is usually assumed in the relevant literature heskel et al 2016 based on this hypothesis an alternative model is proposed that generalises the q 10 coefficient and unifies the conflicting results obtained by researchers overall the primary objective of the present study was to demonstrate that the rates of chemical or biological processes do not obey exponential laws arrhenius law therefore a review of the standard definition of the q 10 coefficient is required 2 methodology 2 1 usual arrhenius model the usual model for the q 10 coefficient is expressed by the following equation 1 q 10 k t 2 k t 1 10 t 2 t 1 where t is the temperature in celsius degrees or kelvin and k is the rate constant expressed as exponential decay with temperature commonly expressed by the arrhenius equation k a e e o r t where a eo and r are the frequency factor activation energy of a reaction and ideal gas constant respectively 2 2 deformed arrhenius model the proposed mathematical model is based on the theory of deformed exponential functions aquilanti et al 2010 wikipedia 2019 following this definition the new arrhenius rate equation is defined as following 2 k d t a 1 d e o r t 1 d it is straightforward to verify that using eq 2 and in according to the iupac definition the new activation energy equation is given by 3 e a e o 1 d e o r t 1 using eqs 1 and 2 the new q d10 coefficient is given by 4 q d 10 k d t 2 k d t 1 10 t 2 t 1 k t lim d 0 k d t and q 10 lim d 0 q d 10 which render a possible generalisation of rates and q 10 coefficients the algebraic sign of the d parameter controls the functional behaviour of the generalized arrhenius law d 0 gives rise to a concave or sub arrhenius behaviour d 0 to a convex or super arrhenius and at d 0 the conventional linear arrhenius form is attained fig 1 a shows the behaviour of the q d10 coefficient as a function of the deformation parameter assuming that the activation energy eo is a constant in the limit case in which d 0 k t 10 k t 2 i e the rate doubles with every 10 degree variation in temperature as predicted by the usual theory tveit et al but in general d 0 non arrhenius see fig 1 the rate ratio can take any value chen and chen 2018 nottingham et al 2019 wang et al watanabe et al huey et al marsay et al terhzaz et al in this new model the q d10 values are also a function of the activation energy eo as shown in fig 1 b these deviations from arrhenius like behaviour is intimately linked to the development of new technologies that enabled the investigation of natural phenomena within a wide range of temperature between 10 k and 600 k aquilanti et al 2018 gao et al 2018 limbach et al 2006 van dishoeck 2017 which was not possible in past decades additionally we propose a new code with a user friendly graphical interface fig 2 able to perform different procedures for computing q 10 and others properties as temperature dependent the code is referred to as q d10gsa that works with concepts relates to the diffusion process or rates eq 2 activation energy eq 3 and q 10 coefficient eq 4 written in python it is a free open source code compatible with windows linux and macos platforms it offers the possibility of estimating phenomenological parameters from arrhenius and d arrhenius plots using the stochastic optimization method generalized simulated annealing gsa dall igna júnior et al 2004 de andrade et al 2008 mundim and tsallis 1996 simulated annealing methods have been used successfully in the description of a variety of global extremization problems simulated annealing methods have attracted significant attention due to their suitability for large scale optimization problems especially for those in which a desired global minimum is hidden among many local minima the basic aspect of the simulated annealing method is that it is analogous to thermodynamics especially concerning the way that liquids freeze and crystallize or that metals cool and anneal the first nontrivial solution along this line was provided by kirkpatrick et al kirkpatrick 1984 kirkpatrick et al for classical systems and also extended by ceperley and alder to quantum systems it strictly follows the quasi equilibrium boltzmann gibbs statistics using a gaussian visiting distribution and is sometimes referred to as classical simulated annealing csa or boltzmann machine the next interesting step in this subject was szu and hartley proposal szu and hartley 1987 to use a cauchy lorentz visiting distribution instead of a gaussian distribution this algorithm is referred to as fast simulated annealing fsa or cauchy machine in 1996 mundim and tsallis 1996 proposed a generalization approach referred to as generalized simulated annealing gsa moret et al 1998 2001 2002 used in this code we expect that this code serve as a quick and practical tool for data characterization from experimental data and different proposed models it presents a very intuitive graphical interface fig 2 which we believe to provide an excellent working tool for emphasize the need to generalize the usual q 10 approach 3 results and applications considering that the q 10 coefficient is widely used to describe a variety of phenomena including chemical kinetics aquilanti et al 2010 respiration in living organisms alcaraz et al 2012 gillooly et al 2006 king et al 2006 lin et al 2007 lombard1 et al 2009 streicher et al 2012 wythers et al 2013 xiao 2000 zhang et al 2015

valid and q10 coefficient values are not consistent with the experimental data moreover it was shown that the theory proposed herein is in line with the experimental data especially in temperature ranges precluding the use of the ordinary formulation the cases addressed in the present study described below involve studying the effect of temperature on metabolic processes in living organisms soil carbon decomposition heart beat and consumption of oxygen and other chemical substances by plants and animals deformed arrhenius plots and activation energy in kj mol were used to standardise the distinct cases addressed in this study the ideal gas constant is r 8 314472 j k 1 m o l 1 3 1 effect of temperature on the metabolism of arctic zooplankton for the first application of the proposed model the results obtained by alcaraz et al 2012 were analysed these authors studied the effect of temperature on the metabolism of arctic zooplankton based on these experimental data the deformed rates kd were fitted to calculate the q d10 coefficient and the activation energy at different temperatures the results are shown in fig 3 a more specifically we assessed the temperature dependence with the rates of respiration and of phosphate and ammonia excretion as shown in fig 4 of reference alcaraz et al 2012 our model returned a sub arrhenius behaviour d 0 associated with the rates of respiration and ammonia excretion whereas the rate of phosphate excretion had a slightly super arrhenius behaviour with d 0 but close to zero because the values of the deformation parameters were not zero the activation energy ea of the reactions was temperature dependent fig 3b d unlike in the ordinary case in which ea is assumed to be constant for respiration and ammonia excretion processes the activation energy increased with increasing temperature fig 3b and 3c whereas in the phosphate excretion the scenario was inverted as the activation energy decreased with increasing temperature super arrhenius behaviour fig 3d additionally unlike the case of respiration process the activation energy in the excretion processes became practically constant at temperatures higher than 300 k and changed abruptly at low temperatures consequently the q d10 coefficients for the three rates decreased with increasing temperature in a non exponential manner d 0 as shown in fig 3a these results demonstrated that the metabolic rates of arctic zooplankton exhibit a nonlinear relationship with temperature in ln k 1 t moreover the metabolism of arctic zooplankton is highly sensitive to changes in temperature d 0 for both respiration and excretion thus nonlinear abrupt responses changes in regime and complex trajectories are to be expected during the evolution of these species the value of activation energy in the case of respiration fig 3b was not constant indicating a high sensitivity of the respiration process to changes in temperature contrastingly in the excretion processes fig 3c and 3d the activation energy was weakly dependent on temperature d 0 in the case of ammonia ne excretion increased with increasing temperature d 0 or sub arrhenius whereas in the case of phosphate the activation energy decreased with increasing temperature d 0 or super arrhenius in the small range of temperatures 273 k to 280 k used in the analysis temperature sensitivity given by the q d10 parameter exhibited an almost linear behaviour in the cases of respiration cr ammonia excretion ne and phosphate excretion pe as shown in fig 3e f 3 2 temperature sensitivity of processes in soil organic carbon soc decomposition several studies eswaran et al 1993 hararuk et al 2015 kirschbaum 2006 lal 2004 lloyd and taylor 1994 mukherjee et al 2013 tang et al 2017 wang et al 2005 yan et al 2017 yang et al 2017 davidson et al kramshøj et al koven et al have recently raised questions regarding the reliability of the usual methods to characterise the temperature sensitivity of processes occurring during soil organic carbon soc decomposition currently the q 10 coefficient is frequently used as a measure to infer the effect of temperature on soc decomposition considering soc decomposition as a multifactorial problem and focusing solely on the influence of temperature on this phenomenon the q 10 coefficient in its usual form is not an adequate measuring parameter because it is defined as the ratio between rates that are assumed a priori as being exponential functions of temperature k a e e o r t therefore ln k 1 t should be linear which contradicts the experimental data obtained by yan et al 2017 and tang et al 2017 these experimental data were reviewed within the q d10 model and the results are shown in fig 4 and 5 to contribute to a better understanding of these problems the influence of temperature on soc decomposition was studied using the proposed model eqs 2 4 which is essential to predict the impact of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems this is because soc contains approximately three times as much carbon as the terrestrial vegetation and twice as much as the atmosphere and because global warming has already noticeably affected the environment yan et al 2017 as previously mentioned the usual form of assessing the importance of temperature in the degradation process is via the q 10 coefficient moreover the results obtained through the standard model are uncertain one of the major factors causing this uncertainty is the temperature sensitivity q 10 t in the process of soc decomposition this was observed in the cases addressed below which required a reformulation of the q 10 t coefficient calculation method this was also one of the main objectives of this study the present study was based on the results obtained by yan et al 2017 and by tang et al 2017 to which the new q 10 model was fitted in these studies the authors estimated the differences in soc decomposition and temperature sensitivity between different soil samples in forested areas as well as between superficial soils and subsoil layers in cropland systems the application of the proposed model to soc decomposition showed that the soil respiration rates analysed by yan et al 2017 did not vary exponentially with temperature see fig 4d this implies a deviation from the usual arrhenius model because the deformation coefficients d were not zero in all the systems assessed in the study noticeably in the case of tl2 topsoil layer upland site 2 the process was of super arrhenius type or convex d 0 fig 4a and 4b and the activation energy was highly sensitive to temperature variations as shown in fig 4c in this process the behaviour of the new q d10 coefficient indicates a strong influence of temperature on soc decomposition this case is a classic example in which the standard definition of the q 10 coefficient does not apply the other three cases tl1 sl1 and sl2 exhibited almost linear sub arrhenius behaviour d 0 these results indicated that the respiration rate soc in the topsoil layer tl is more sensitive to temperature variations than that in the subsoil layer sl the q d10 coefficient in the upland tl case establishes a rate ratio of 3 5 k d t 2 k d t 1 9 0 between 7 30 c the fitting parameters are shown in table 1 3 3 temperature sensitivity in processes of soc decomposition in different types of soil in the same context tang et al 2017 investigated temperature sensitivity of soc decomposition in different types of soil surface of deciduous forest surface of semi arid grassland evergreen forest and tropical rainforest revisiting of these experimental results within the deformed arrhenius model eqs 2 4 demonstrated that the deformation coefficients were d 0 in all cases and were therefore characterised as being of the sub arrhenius type fig 5a c the obtained q d10 coefficients led to rate ratios of 1 95 k d t 2 k d t 1 2 40 between 12 32 c fig 5b these variations in decomposition rates induced a change in the activation energy to be temperature dependent as opposed to the standard model that assumes activation energy as being constant 3 4 temperature sensitivity in physiological reactions of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems physiological reaction rates particularly those of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems are strongly affected by body temperature schmidt nielsen 1984 stahl 1967 streicher et al 2012 weibel et al 1996 in the present study the influence of temperature on heart rate was investigated in the cockroach gromphadorhina portentosa using the new model for rates as proposed by streicher et al 2012 heart rates among this species do not vary exponentially with temperature and therefore the arrhenius plot does not apply in this case see fig 6 fig 6 shows respiration rate behaviour a the q d10 coefficient b and activation energy c the analysed reactions in this case can be classified as super arrhenius type d 0 and the activation energy was highly sensitive to temperature variation the q d10 coefficients exhibited a weakly nonlinear dependence on body temperature heart rate was less sensitive to temperature changes in the adult stage than in the other instars this is because the deformation parameter d is lower in the adult stage than in other phases of development the q d10 coefficient in both cases yielded a rate ratio of 2 k d t 2 k d t 1 2 2 between 280 305 k the rate variation with temperature fig 6d indicated a super arrhenius behaviour d 0 the fitting parameters are shown in table 2 3 5 convergence in the temperature response of leaf respiration across biomes and plant functional types plant respiration involves a massive flow of carbon to the atmosphere and a great control over the global carbon cycle heskel and collaborators heskel et al 2016 recently studied respiration in 231 plant species in seven biomes and concluded that the exponential models of respiration rates k t do not correctly describe the temperature sensitivity of k this means that ln k 1 t is not a linear function therefore the q10 coefficient must be reviewed in similar cases fig 7 a based on the results obtained by heskel et al 2016 this hypothesis was confirmed and ln k 1 t was shown to be of the super arrhenius type d 0 in both cases analysed by those authors in addition the q d10 coefficient fig 7b and activation energies fig 6c in the 0 20 c range changed abruptly with temperature temperate woodland biomes d 0 2257 were more sensitive to temperature changes than broadleaf deciduous temperate forests d 0 2173 in both the analysed cases the rate ratio was 1 6 k d t 2 k d t 1 2 6 between 15 40 c as shown in fig 7b these results indicate that the deformation parameter d is an indicator of thermal sensitivity in plant respiration i e sensitivity increases with increasing d 3 6 rate of oxygen consumption in mitochondria of the eurythermal killifish fundulus heteroclitus environmental temperature is an extremely important factor in processes involved in the metabolism of living organisms abele et al 2002 chang et al 2013 clark et al 2013 clarke 2004 clarke and fraser 2004 deban and lappin 2011 dell et al 2013 fangue et al 2009 gillooly et al 2006 halsey et al 2015 lake et al 2013 mccullough et al 1999 reyes et al 2008 schulte 2015 stanley 2010 wood et al raes et al in particular temperature plays an important role in the distribution and abundance of a species by affecting aerobic metabolism based on data obtained by schulte 2015 and fangue et al 2009 we now demonstrate that the rate of oxygen consumption in mitochondria of the eurythermal killifish fundulus heteroclitus cannot be described using the arrhenius law see fig 8 a in this case a deformation parameter d 0 indicates that ln k 1 t must be a nonlinear function of temperature and therefore the respiration rate does not decrease exponentially fig 8a shows the experimental data solid points the standard arrhenius plot dashed line and the model proposed herein solid line the respiration rate described by eq 2 fits perfectly to the experimental data with a deformation parameter of d 0 1982 which implies a rate of the super arrhenius type the q d10 coefficient indicates a rate ratio of 1 5 k d t 2 k d t 1 4 5 between 0 35 c as shown in fig 8b the activation energy changed abruptly below 0 c fig 8c these results indicated that the arrhenius law does not apply and is not predictive in the temperature region outside that established by the experimental data 4 discussion and conclusions the fitting quality of the new model in the analysed cases strengthens the initial hypothesis that the rates used in the definition of the q 10 temperature coefficient are described by power laws instead of exponential laws as established by the standard model the standard q 10 coefficient model is a particular case of the proposed model and validates its overall rationale however its applications and differentiated contexts require fitting the fitting quality of the new model to the experimental data is partly due to the flexibility of the deformed exponential function accomplished by the deformation parameter d in extreme cases at which d 0 then k t 10 k t 2 i e the rate doubles as the temperature increase by 10 units as predicted by the ordinary theory nevertheless in general cases d 0 and non arrhenius the rate ratio can be any positive value a consequence of this new model is that activation energy ea is temperature dependent unlike in the conventional models where ea is defined as constant the model proposed in the present study was successfully validated using data from experiments in which the usual arrhenius theory was shown to be insufficient considering that the ordinary model is a particular case of the proposed model and the quality of the results obtained in the various analysed cases it is suggested that there is a wider range of application for q d10 in the description of

24789,pre fishing season june and july pacific saury cololabis saira occur offshore east of japan before migrating west to nearshore waters where they are exploited by japanese fishers in the autumn september november to forecast the location of these fishing grounds we develop a migration model using oceanographic temperature and current velocity and fisheries pre fishing pacific saury distribution obtained from stock assessment surveys data and migration characteristics determined from fishery data analysis we speculate that pacific saury migrate seasonally first north staying within a certain temperature zone from may to july then west remaining within a preferred but gradually increasing temperature zone we tune our model using hindcast calculation to reproduce actual fishing grounds around japan in july 2018 we forecast the locations of early pacific saury fishing grounds from august to september our forecast fishing grounds were subsequently validated by actual positions of the fishing grounds our model successfully forecast the locations of early fishing grounds along the kuril islands archipelago and forecast particles that reached an offshore region roughly predicted offshore fishing grounds this model also identified pacific saury migration route trajectories in detail and that these two fishing grounds in 2018 were formed from geographically separated pre fishing season shoals via different migration routes we believe that applying our model will improve the efficiency of the pacific saury fishery and fleet operation through savings in vessel fuel and time spent searching for shoals keywords pacific saury migration model early fishing ground pre fishing distribution fra roms 1 introduction pacific saury cololabis saira is a small fish that is widely distributed throughout subtropical to subarctic regions of the north pacific hubbs and wisner 1980 this species caught primarily by stick held dip nets is of commercial importance to japan russia korea taiwan and china whereas both japan and russia fish for this species mainly within their exclusive economic zones eezs other countries exploit it within the north pacific high seas huang et al 2007 tseng et al 2014 the life span of pacific saury is short approximately 2 years suyama et al 2006 with fish of 1 year age being the main fishing target its total catch has varied greatly from 18 1 104 tons in 1998 to 63 1 104 tons in 2014 http www fao org fishery species 3001 en until 2000 japan caught more than 70 of the global catch but after 2010 with catch in other countries increasing japan s proportional take of the total catch decreased to less than 50 during their short life cycle pacific saury migrate over a wide area fig 1 their primary spawning ground is in the kuroshio region in the winter watanabe and lo 1989 from here hatched larvae and juveniles are transported east along the kuroshio extension oozeki et al 2015 before migrating north from subtropical regions into subarctic waters from may to july for feeding fukushima 1979 after sufficient growth they commence a return migration towards subtropical spawning grounds in august or september ito et al 2004 tseng et al 2014 during which time the japanese pacific saury fishery starts early fishing grounds for japanese vessels occur mainly along the kuril islands archipelago or around the southeast coast of hokkaido depending on the distribution of the oyashio current fig 1 fukushima 1979 yasuda and kitagawa 1996 it is known that the oyashio forms two tongue shaped intrusions the nearshore oyashio first o1 and the offshore oyashio second o2 intrusion sekine 1988 because fishing grounds around o1 are closer to japanese fishing ports than those of o2 fishing there reduces vessel fuel costs and leads to the landing of fresher fish interannual geographical shifts in the offshore oyashio front correspond with those of pacific saury fishing grounds yasuda and watanabe 1994 previous studies have suggested that the spatial and temporal distributions and migration routes of pacific saury are linked to environmental conditions fukushima 1979 tian et al 2003 watanabe et al 2006 yasuda and watanabe 1994 yasuda and kitagawa 1996 tseng et al 2014 accordingly the areas where early fishing grounds form off japan vary from year to year the primary factor affecting the horizontal distribution of these fish is considered to be temperature watanabe et al 1999 2006 tian et al 2003 tseng et al 2014 with 15 c regarded as preferred huang et al 2007 in addition food density is also important for growth and migration ito et al 2004 oozeki et al 2004 and likely influences the horizontal distribution of these fish since 2003 the tohoku national fisheries research institute tnfri has conducted stock assessment surveys using surface trawls from june to july pre fishing season between 143 e and 165 w tnfri 2018 pre fishing season nearshore pacific saury abundance is low because fish are mainly distributed east of 150 e miyamoto et al 2019 fish later migrate west to recruit into japanese nearshore waters during the main september november fishing season a similar western movement is found in taiwanese fishery data tseng et al 2014 because taiwanese fishing vessels mainly operate in the high seas post august fishing grounds tend to occur along the russian eez boundary from 42 4 n 151 e to 41 5 n 165 e black line in fig 1 therefore migration characteristics discerned from territorial fisheries statistics represent an incomplete picture of the entire life history of this species tnfri stock assessment surveys also reveal fish abundance in waters west of 162 e to have decreased drastically after 2010 which resulted in poor early fishing season catches and delays in formation of early nearshore fishing grounds in japan tnfri 2018 most pacific saury fishermen concern themselves with the time and location of early fishery grounds because initial seasonal products trade at higher prices to this end predictions as to when and where early fishing grounds will form are commercially important and are provided at https www jfa maff go jp j press sigen 190731 html forecasts have historically been made qualitatively based on empirical knowledge when pre fishing season pacific saury occurred nearer to the japanese coast pacific saury reached the main japanese fishing area earlier suyama et al 2012 and vice versa with fishing grounds formed along the oyashio fukushima 1979 yasuda and watanabe 1994 yasuda and kitagawa 1996 until ocean circulation models were developed the future oyashio distribution was determined using a persistence forecast method based on observed hydrographic conditions that is the observed oyashio distribution was assumed to be maintained for 1 2 months this resulted in the forecast tending to fail when the oyashio distribution changed abruptly since 2012 the oyashio distribution has been forecast using fra roms a regional ocean modeling system roms developed by the japan fisheries research and education agency fra kuroda et al 2017 by using the forecast based on physical processes the forecast accuracy of the oyashio distribution has improved forecasts of the timing of the pacific saury fishing ground formation in nearshore japanese waters had been conducted empirically based on the pre fishing fish distribution until miyamoto et al 2019 proposed a new method based on the radius of otolith annual rings using this method we became able to forecast migration dates however this method enable us to determine migration dates regardless of oceanic conditions that vary every year the ability to forecast both the time and location of early fishing grounds taking oceanographic conditions into consideration would represent a considerable improvement on existing forecast methods recent numerical models have simulated the migration of various fish species such as sardine and herring e g megrey et al 2007 okunishi et al 2009 moriarty et al 2016 pacific saury transport processes during their early life stages have also been examined with particle tracking models using observed current velocity fields iwahashi et al 2006 oozeki et al 2015 for adult pacific saury mechanisms controlling growth were examined using a bioenergetics model nemuro fish north pacific ecosystem model for understanding regional oceanography for including saury and herring ito et al 2007 kishi et al 2007 mukai et al 2007 accounting for growth of pacific saury throughout their life history ito et al 2004 for which the influence of ocean warming on fish migration patterns is discussed ito et al 2013 in this model pacific saury migrate among three meridionally distributed oceanographic domains in which the temperature of each is assumed to be constant spatially but to change over time with spatial differences in temperature considered to represent differences among domains this model does not take zonal temperature distributions into consideration and pacific saury migrate south during their spawning migration models including the western migration of fish in two dimensional horizontal temperature and current velocity fields would improve forecasts of early fishing ground times and locations to develop a migration model knowledge about migration characteristics of a target fish is necessary for pacific saury while approximate migration patterns can be estimated fig 1 detailed trajectories of migration routes and the environments experienced during migration are unknown the reason is that tag and recapture methods e g schwarz et al 1993 block et al 2005 and biologging technologies e g cooke et al 2016 are difficult to apply to pacific saury because of their small size and delicate nature for this reason migration model parameters must be estimated from limited data relating to pacific saury distributions and be incorporated into migration model properly therefore the modelling of migration characteristics is an important key to reproduce a plausible migration route because our goal is to improve the accuracy of forecast times and locations of the early pacific saury fishing grounds modelling specialized for forecast migration from pre fishing to early fishing seasons would be effective we endeavor to develop a migration model for pacific saury from pre fishing to early fishing seasons using pre fishing season pacific saury distributions fishery data and oceanic conditions temperature and velocity fields obtained from an ocean circulation model fra roms for the initial distribution of pacific saury we use data on the distribution of age 1 fish obtained from pre fishing season stock assessment surveys we determined migration characteristics from analysis of actual fishing grounds for oceanic conditions we incorporate two dimensional temperature and velocity fields calculated by fra roms then using reanalysis data and 2 month forecasts from fra roms in july 2018 after completing stock assessment surveys we forecast pacific saury distributions 2 months in advance to predict the location of early fishing grounds from august to september our forecast fishing grounds were validated using fishery data on the actual fishing grounds for that year 2 materials methods 2 1 outline of models our migration model for pacific saury uses pre fishing distributions obtained from stock assessment surveys as the initial distribution of pacific saury and two dimensional temperature and velocity fields calculated by fra roms for oceanic conditions as the horizontal resolution of fra roms is 0 1 n 0 1 e the horizontal resolution of our model is the same because the eastern boundary of the fra roms calculation area is 180 our model was also run up to 180 although stock assessment surveys were conducted from 143 e to 165 w daily temperature and velocity fields at the sea surface from 30 n 130 e to 60 n 180 are downloaded from the fra roms web site http fm dc affrc go jp fra roms index html the fra roms output comprises reanalysis and 2 month forecast data reanalysis data are produced using observed meteorological forcing variables assimilating observed temperature salinity and sea surface height the 2 month forecast data are produced under climatological values of meteorological forcing variables without assimilation using the latest reanalysis data as initial oceanographic conditions data are updated weekly our model is developed for simulating age 1 pacific saury migration we assume that pacific saury of body length bl 27 cm represent age 1 fish we assume the averaged bl of age 1 fish is 0 3 m and use this as a standard to calculate swimming speed kurita 2003 reported that the in situ swimming speed is 1 2 2 2 bl s 1 we estimate swimming speed using fishery data and from hindcast calculation using fra roms reanalysis data to forecast the distribution of fishing grounds in 2018 we used pre fishing season survey data and fra roms reanalysis and forecast data forecast results were validated by observed fishery grounds of age 1 pacific saury in that year 2 2 migration model we reproduce the migration of age 1 pacific saury from their pre fishing season june july locations to those of the early fishing season in japan august september using particle tracking with time integration based on lagrangian transport particle trajectories were calculated based on a two dimensional current velocity field at the sea surface generated by fra roms as follows 1 x t d t x t u t u s d t y t d t y t v t v s d t α where x and y represent the eastern and northern locations of a particle at time t respectively and u and v represent the eastern and northern components of current velocity determined by fra roms at a grid including x y respectively eastern us and northern v s fish swimming speeds were determined from analysis of fishery data during the northern migration and hindcast calculation during the spawning migration speeds differed between the northern and spawning migrations the time step dt was set to 30 min and the leap frog scheme was implemented α is a meridional shift term that limits pacific saury to a temperature zone because our calculation area is west of 180 particles reaching the eastern boundary were eliminated from analysis pacific saury seldom occur in the bering and okhotsk seas therefore we use bathymetry in which we treat the depth of these two seas as 0 m treated as land to limit pacific saury to a temperature zone which we assume is preferred we use a two dimensional temperature field at the sea surface in fra roms and incorporate this preferred temperature tp into our model an individual tp value is given to each particle set to the temperature at which particles are released as follows 2 t p i t x 0 i y 0 i t 0 i where i denotes an individual particle t x y t represents the temperature at the sea surface determined by fra roms at a grid including x y in time t x 0 i and y 0 i represent the horizontal coordinates where particle i was released and t 0 i represents the time when particle i was released to restrict pacific saury to a temperature zone we regulate α in eq 1 as follows first we calculate eq 1 setting α 0 and obtain the forecast horizontal coordinate xt yt if t xt yt t tp 0 2 c we search for the nearest y coordinate latitude where tp equals a subdivided point between t xt yt m t and t xt yt m 1 t m is the number of grid units for searching a subdivided point then we shift the particle meridionally to the subdivided point the shift corresponds to α when we search the subdivided point meridionally we set m as 5 to 4 that is the maximum search range as 0 5 n from the northward coordinate of the forecast particle yt this compulsory meridional shift scheme was executed once a day in time integration therefore the maximum shift is 0 5 n day 1 the meridional shift of 0 5 n day 1 is approximately equal to our calculated pacific saury swimming speed of 2 1 bl s 1 comparable to the in situ swimming speed kurita 2003 in most cases the subdivided point occurred within 0 5 n from yt if a point did not exist we set α 0 that is a meridional shift did not occur such cases occurred for particles distributed adjacent to the coast our migration model calculation started from the first date when pacific saury were caught in stock assessment surveys for hindcast calculation trajectories from june to september were calculated using fra roms reanalysis data for forecast calculation we used reanalysis data and 2 month forecast data from fra roms the initial distribution of pacific saury was set according to pre fishing distributions of fish obtained from stock assessment surveys we released particles for tracking at locations where trawl observations were conducted on dates when age 1 pacific saury were caught x 0 i y 0 i at t 0 i 2 3 estimation of migration speed and preferred temperature during the northern migration catch per unit effort cpue data for pacific saury tons day 1 and temperature data at the sea surface in high seas from may to july in 2007 2015 fig 2 a obtained by the marine fisheries research and development center jamarc of the japan fisheries research and education agency were analyzed we calculated the locations of fishing centers weighted by cpue for every 10 days from early may to late july as mentioned in our results fishing center latitudes were significantly correlated with date revealing the northern migration of fish from may to july to compare this northern migration of the fishing center to temporal change in temperature we estimated the latitudes of the 11 14 c isothermal lines in the pre fishing season distribution of pacific saury 155 170 e for 2007 2015 using daily two dimensional temperature fields at the sea surface from fra roms the latitudes of these isothermal lines were averaged zonally for every 10 days the rate of northern movement of pacific saury fishery centers 0 1 m s 1 fig 2b coincided with the rate of northern movement of sea surface water of 13 c fig 3 approximately 0 3 bl s 1 which is considerably below the swimming speed of age 1 pacific saury reported by kurita 2003 based on this we assume that pacific saury migrate within a certain temperature zone tp following the northward movement of an isotherm until the end of july rather than swimming continuously in a fixed direction accordingly we set us and v s at zero and held tp constant during the northern migration although swimming speed is zero particles move north and remain within a certain temperature zone through α 2 4 estimating migration speed and preferred temperature during the spawning migration we analyzed japanese fishing vessel using stick held dip nets data from august to november 2003 2017 to investigate tp during the spawning migration we estimated the centers of fishing grounds and temperature weighted by cpue for every 10 days temperature at the center of fishing grounds from august to november increased linearly at 0 295 c every 10 days as the fishing center moved south fig 4 b from this result we assume the spawning migration starts after 1 august and tp increases at this rate during the spawning migration because pacific saury migrate from far offshore east of 150 e to nearshore japan westward migration occurs miyamoto et al 2019 to migrate west staying within a temperature zone we assume that pacific saury swim along a predominantly zonally distributed isotherm swimming direction along an isotherm was calculated from the two dimensional temperature field of fra roms temperature gradients at particles were calculated using adjacent grid point temperature values and swimming direction us v s was set to a direction orthogonal to this temperature gradient towards the west a conceptual diagram of our migration model is presented in fig 5 absolute swimming speed u s 2 v s 2 in the spawning migration is an unknown parameter we determined this by hindcast calculation for which modeled particles accurately predicted the actual centers of early japanese fishing grounds in mid september from 2010 to 2017 when pacific saury were distributed further east than before 2010 to evaluate the model s reproducibility we calculated the fishing center weighted by cpue using the top 20 of the fishing ground locations closest to the southwest the top 20 of hindcast particles closest to the southwestern area were used for comparison we evaluated the reproducibility of hindcast calculation by the averaged distance between this fishing center and these particles in mid september of each year for hindcast calculation we conducted case studies in which swimming speeds were set at 1 5 3 0 bl s 1 at 0 5 bl s 1 increments because the actual fishing grounds and hindcast particles were closest at a swimming speed of 2 5 bl s 1 fig 6 we set a swimming speed of 0 75 m s 1 for the spawning migration 2 5 forecast calculation in mid july 2018 after completion of stock assessment surveys with our migration model we forecast the location of early fishing grounds from august to mid september in 2018 from june to 14 july we used fra roms reanalysis temperature and current velocity fields followed by through to 15 september 2 month forecast data in our model we released 26 particles that correspond to surface trawl survey dates swimming speed was that estimated from fishery data analysis and hindcast calculations zero for the northern migration until 31 july and 2 5 bl s 1 for the spawning migration after 1 august after 1 august we increased tp by 0 295 c every 10 days forecast results were validated by the locations of actual early fishery grounds in that year to quantitatively evaluate our forecast results we calculated the distance between the center of the actual fishery grounds and the top 20 of particles that were closest to the southwestern area comparable to our hindcast calculations section 2 4 3 results 3 1 northern and spawning migration characteristics the spatial and temporal distributions of fishery grounds in may circles june crosses and july triangles from 2007 to 2015 jamarc data are depicted in fig 2a fishing grounds are distributed widely and discontinuously between 146 e and 173 e because fisheries operated in the high seas a distribution limited by the boundary with the russian eez is apparent fishing vessels could pursue a fish shoal to the eez boundary but once a shoal moved into russia s eez then vessels ceased fishing and had to search for another high seas shoal when weather was severe fishing vessels also had to leave fishing grounds and find new grounds when the weather improved therefore data represent an incomplete account of pacific saury migration the center of the fishing grounds moved from 39 0 41 6 n in may to 42 5 45 8 n in july fig 2b the fishing center latitude was significantly positively related to date r 0 89 p 0 001 fishing center longitude and the temperature at the sea surface varied considerably fig 2c 2d and did not significantly correlate with date r 0 07 and 0 13 respectively p 0 7 while the fishing center latitude increased from may to july there was no significant relationship between temperature at the sea surface and the fishing center r 0 31 p 0 3 fig 2e the latitudes of the 11 14 c isotherms estimated from two dimensional temperature fields at the sea surface of fra roms in the pre fishing season distribution of pacific saury are shown in figs 3a d with the latitude of the center of the fishing grounds lines in fig 2b isotherms moved north from may to july movement of the 13 c isotherm was most consistently related to the northward movement of the fishing center fig 3c the rate of northward movement of the isotherm is estimated at 0 1 m s 1 because the rate is slower than the swimming speed of age 1 pacific saury kurita 2003 we assume that pacific saury migrate north within a certain temperature zone tp rather than swimming continuously in a fixed direction fishing center 10 day averaged latitudes and the temperature at the sea surface during the spawning migration were estimated from japanese fishery data between the months of august and november for the years spanning 2003 2017 fig 4 for some years there were no or limited data in early august and late november the fishing center latitude gradually decreased from mid august to mid november while the temperature at the sea surface at the fishing center gradually increased from early august to mid november fig 4b from this result we assume the spawning migration started after 1 august based on least square fit analysis the increase rate of temperature at the sea surface from august to november was estimated at 0 295 c every 10 days indicating preferred temperature increased with the pacific saury southern migration swimming speed during the spawning migration was determined from hindcast calculation the top 20 of hindcast particles reaching the southwestern area were compared with the top 20 of fishing grounds closest to the southwest fig 6 the estimated location of the fishing center in mid september 2014 was 42 5 n 145 9 e cross symbols in figs 6a c hindcast particles at a swimming speed of 2 0 bl s 1 occurred around 147 e not reaching this center fig 6a those of swimming speed 2 5 bl s 1 occurred around the fishing center fig 6b some particles at a swimming speed of 3 0 bl s 1 overshot the fishing center and were transported west of 144 e fig 6c in other years between 2010 and 2017 hindcast particles at a swimming speed 2 5 bl s 1 closely approximated the actual positions of the fishing grounds averaged distances between fishing centers and the top 20 of hindcast particles reaching the southwestern area in 2010 2017 were 303 7 181 7 134 4 and 150 4 km for swimming speeds of 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 bl s 1 respectively fig 6d accordingly we assume the swimming speed during the spawning migration to be 2 5 bl s 1 corresponding to 0 75 m s 1 3 2 forecasting early fishing grounds forecast particle distributions for 20 and 31 august and 15 september 2018 are shown in fig 7 on 20 august the westernmost particle reached 45 0 n 149 4 e other particles occurred along the kuril islands archipelago from 46 6 n 151 9 e to 48 5 n 155 5 e fig 7a the temperature where these particles occurred ranged 11 13 c at the sea surface with this lower temperature corresponding to the oyashio current fig 8 a the initial distributions crosses in fig 7 of these particles were at 155 e or 159 e relatively nearshore western stations from the japanese coast trajectories revealed these particles migrated north to around the kamchatka peninsula then southwest along the kuril islands archipelago on 31 august westernmost forecast particles occurred along the kuril islands archipelago from 45 5 n 149 5 e to 47 2 n 152 5 e fig 7b at sea surface temperatures ranging 11 13 c fig 8b these particles are the same as those found along the kuril islands archipelago on 20 august which indicates a southwestern movement of fish shoals on 15 september some particles occurred along the kuril islands archipelago and two particles occurred about 300 km offshore off etorofu island 41 8 n 148 0 e fig 7c the former were initially distributed in relatively nearshore stations as before 20 and 31 august but the latter two particles migrated from stations further offshore 171 e the initial release latitudes of these two particles were about 40 n and were the southernmost stations at which pacific saury were caught in 2018 stock assessment surveys initial tp where these two particles were released 14 3 c and 15 1 c were the highest for all released particles their trajectories revealed that they had migrated zonally west to east through a high temperature area in contrast to particles distributed along the kuril islands archipelago fig 8c of the particles released east of 160 e 60 did not travel westward across 160 e until mid september 3 3 forecast validation japanese stick held dip net fishing grounds in mid august 2018 formed in two areas along the kuril islands archipelago around 45 n 149 e black squares in fig 9 a and 47 n 153 e gray squares in fig 9a the first of these areas the southwest corresponded to our forecast westernmost particle on 20 august 45 0 n 149 4 e red circle in fig 9a the distance between the location of this particle and the fishing center in the southwest fishing area black cross in fig 9a was 20 4 km the second northeast area corresponded to the remainder of the top 20 of particles closest to southwestern area orange circles in fig 9a the average distance between these subsequent particles and the fishing center gray cross in fig 9a was 110 4 km late august fishing grounds formed from 45 0 47 6 n and 152 8 154 1 e similar to mid august northeastern fishing grounds along the kuril islands archipelago squares in fig 9b the top 20 of particles closest to the southwestern area were also distributed along the archipelago red circles in fig 9b the westernmost two of these reached west of 152 e where no fishing grounds occurred four forecast particles including one of the remaining 80 of particles black circles corresponded to fishing grounds the average distance between the centers of fishing grounds cross in fig 9b and the top 20 of particles closest to the southwestern area red circles in fig 9b was 135 6 km except for the two preceding particles the average distance was 70 6 km in mid september fishing grounds formed in the southwest 40 7 42 5 n 149 4 152 5 e black squares in fig 9c and northeast 45 7 46 6 n and 154 0 155 0 e gray squares in fig 9c areas the southwest fishing grounds occurred offshore and formed here for the first time that year two particles red circles in fig 9c were distributed west of this southwest fishing area the average distance between these two particles and the southwestern center of fishing grounds black cross in fig 9c was 301 2 km except for these two particles the top 20 of particles closest to the southwestern area orange circles in fig 9c were distributed west of the northeast fishing area the average distance between these particles and the fishing center gray cross in fig 9c was 372 2 km however the locations of several particles found between 45 9 n and 47 8 n and 152 0 e and 155 4 e were almost consistent with northeastern fishing grounds the average distance between the fishing center in the northeast area and forecast particles around it blue circles in fig 9c was 103 7 km 4 discussion our migration model forecasts the distributions of early fishing grounds for pacific saury in nearshore japanese waters using two dimensional temperature and velocity fields derived from fra roms our initial distributions of pacific saury were based on observed pre fishing season distributions obtained by tnfri northern and spawning migration characteristics were estimated from analysis of actual fishing grounds we estimated swimming speed of pacific saury during the spawning migration based on hindcast calculations that faithfully reproduced actual fishing grounds thus our migration model is based on actual pacific saury migration characteristics and hydrographic conditions with high reproducibility our migration model represents progress on that of miyamoto et al 2019 for which predicted migration dates of pacific saury were based on relationships between pre fishing distribution longitude and western fish migration velocity only regardless of oceanic conditions we believe application of our model will improve the efficiency of the pacific saury fishery and fleet operation by saving vessel fuel and the time spent searching for fish shoals we tested our model in 2018 by predicting the locations of early fishing grounds these predictions were validated by actual fishing ground positions fig 9 in the 2018 fishing season in mid august our forecast particles were distributed around two fishing grounds along the kuril islands archipelago fig 9a differences between fishing centers and the forecast particles around them were 20 4 and 110 4 km for the southwest and northeast fishing areas respectively in late august two preceding forecast particles reached west of 152 e fig 9b where no fishing grounds occurred the locations of subsequent particles were consistent with actual fishing grounds separated from its center by an average distance of 70 6 km the westernmost particles along the kuril islands archipelago in mid september orange circles in fig 9c were located at an average distance of 372 2 km from the northeast fishing center gray cross in fig 9c however subsequent forecast particles blue circles in fig 9c were distributed around the fishing ground separated from its center by an average distance of 103 7 km thus after mid august the average distance between the centers of fishing grounds and the locations of forecast particles along the kuril islands archipelago ranged 20 4 110 4 km similar to or lower than distances estimated from hindcast calculation for 2010 2017 ranging 77 1 187 9 km averaging 134 4 km fig 6d given these results we consider our migration model successfully forecast fishing grounds that formed along this archipelago early in the fishing season because forecast particles reproduce actual fishing grounds we regard the migration trajectories obtained from our model to be plausible and that our model successfully identified detailed migration routes of pacific saury from pre fishing to early fishing grounds our model s migration trajectories revealed pacific saury along the kuril islands archipelago originated from areas relatively near to the coast of japan 155 e or 159 e our forecast identified fishing grounds would occur in mid september about 300 km off etorofu island red circles in fig 9c although these forecast particles proved to be located 301 2 km west of the actual fishing center black cross in fig 9c at a swimming speed of 0 75 m s 1 64 8 km day 1 during the spawning migration fish could travel this distance in 4 6 days if constantly migrating westward because our analysis is based primarily on 10 day averaged data we deemed our forecast for offshore fishing grounds to be a success possible reasons for differences between forecast and actual fishing positions are discussed below forecast trajectories revealed these offshore fishing grounds were formed by pacific saury that had migrated from stations further offshore in 171 e we consider that it would have been impossible to forecast the location of fishing grounds off etorofu island using traditional empirical forecast methods pacific saury that were initially distributed around 171 e reached japanese nearshore waters earlier than those that were distributed in more western areas in mid september indicating the former had migrated west faster than the latter this observation is consistent with miyamoto et al 2019 wherein it was reported that the migration speed of pacific saury in the western area during the pre fishing season had a slower migration speed than those further east although swimming speed is constant at 2 5 bl s 1 during the spawning migration in our migration model they reached the nearshore area earlier most likely because they migrated directly west to east without a northward detour their northern migration route is shorter than for other fish these fish were initially distributed in higher temperature 14 15 c waters during the pre fishing season their northern migration route was relatively short because the 14 15 c isotherm had not moved as far north as had lower isothermal lines that year the majority 60 of particles released east of 160 e did not travel westward across 160 e until mid september fig 7c hindcast calculation from june to november revealed that approximately 80 of released particles reached the coast of japan by late november this suggests that pacific saury shoals distributed in offshore regions subsequently migrate to nearshore waters of japan as the fishing season progresses the remaining 20 of particles migrated southward in offshore regions previous studies have reported that pacific saury spawning grounds are distributed from nearshore to offshore regions along the kuroshio and the kuroshio extension iwahashi et al 2006 baitaliuk et al 2013 oozeki et al 2015 we consider these 20 of southward migrating particles to have contributed to spawning in offshore waters while our predictions successfully identified early fishing grounds there were minor discrepancies in the forecast positions of fish shoals and the actual centers of fishing grounds several particles were found southwest of actual fishing grounds in late august fig 9b and mid september orange circles in fig 9c along the kuril islands archipelago assuming pacific saury abundance represented by each particle is proportional to stock assessment survey trawl catch and that abundance does not change between the pre and early fishing seasons the abundance of pacific saury represented by these particles was lower than that of other particles along the kuril islands archipelago accordingly we feel that pacific saury abundance was higher in actual fishing grounds than it was in the southwestern area alternatively preceding shoals these particles were considered to have been caught by mid august causing decreased abundance because fishing grounds formed in mid august for these reasons the area around 46 47 n 153 154 e is considered to have been selected as the fishing grounds after late august fishery data does not cover the entire distribution of pacific saury and fishing grounds are not only selected by pacific saury abundance but artificial factors also more accurate validation of forecasts requires scientific surveys to determine pacific saury abundance in areas in which forecast particles occur the locations of mid september forecast particles off etorofu island were 301 2 km west of the actual offshore fishing grounds red circles and black cross in fig 9c because the fra roms forecast calculation is driven by climatological data of meteorological conditions the 2 month forecast temperatures and current velocities are less accurate than those of reanalysis data the decreased accuracy in our model s oceanographic conditions may contribute to differences in forecast and actual fishing fleet positions to clarify the influence of 2 month fra roms forecast data we conducted hindcast calculations using reanalysis data for 2018 two particles reached 42 n 149 e approximately 200 km west of the center of the offshore fishing ground the accuracy in oceanic conditions influence accuracy of forecast migration but room for improvement remains the timing of the switch from northern to spawning migration we use 1 august based on fishery data also contributes to differences in the distributions of forecast particles and actual fishing grounds the switching time probably varies with fish body size and condition with larger or more mature pacific saury possibly commencing their spawning migration earlier than smaller thinner or less mature fish forecast calculation with a spawning migration commencing on 5 august had the shortest average distance 78 6 km between the center of offshore fishing grounds and the forecast particle locations therefore when the spawning migration commences strongly influences the accuracy of the forecast the proportion of age 1 fish in the two shoals from off etorofu island was approximately 40 which means that shoals comprised mainly age 0 fish therefore a spawning migration commencement delay may occur swimming speed during the spawning migration might also affect forecasts while we used a speed of 2 5 bl s 1 in our model slight differences in this can contribute to large differences in particle location over long periods of integration time the centers of offshore fishing grounds and forecast particle locations were shortest average distance 64 8 km at a swimming speed of 2 3 bl s 1 which indicates that swimming speed does strongly influence the accuracy of a forecast if swimming speed is proportional to bl differences in average bl between different shoals would affect dispersal differences we used an average bl for age 1 fish of 30 cm for example a shoal which consists of relatively larger age 1 pacific saury body length 32 33 cm may move faster than one which consists of relatively smaller individuals body length 27 28 cm the average bl of age 1 pacific saury in the two shoals to reach waters off etorofu island was same as for other shoals however because these shoals comprised largely age 0 fish a reduced swimming speed may occur although the estimated time delay 4 days and reduction of swimming speed 0 2 bl s 1 are quite small a difference of hundreds of km in distance traveled results it is presently difficult to detail migration characteristics for each shoal but if we could do so and incorporate this information into our model then its forecast accuracy would be improved further investigation into the cues that pacific saury use to switch from northern to spawning migrations and the swimming speed during the spawning migration is needed another limitation of our model is the small number of particles that we could release because the initial distributions of particles were based on pre fishing season stock assessment surveys shoals that were not identified in surveys likely contribute to the formation of fishing grounds in nearshore japanese waters therefore our model does not have the accuracy that fishing grounds will not form where forecast particles are not distributed it is difficult to increase the number of surface trawl stations because of limitations in ship time to adopt actual august fishing ground positions as data on the initial distribution of pacific saury for our model would improve forecast distributions for and beyond september additionally by repeatedly updating our initial pacific saury distributions and forecast oceanographic conditions our model could forecast fishing ground positions for the entire fishing season august november analysis of fishing grounds reveals pacific saury swim within a temperature zone during their northern and spawning migrations during the northern migration fish move at about 0 3 bl s 1 0 1 m s 1 a rate differing from their actual instantaneous swimming speed pacific saury probably swim faster e g 1 2 bl s 1 during this migration but because they do not continuously swim in a fixed direction their temporally averaged swimming rate migration speed is slower than their instantaneous swimming speed the daily ration of pacific saury is high during their northern migration kurita and sugisaki 2004 so they likely swim in search of food further slowing their migration speed during the spawning migration pacific saury move west remaining within a preferred temperature zone to incorporate this process in our migration model we assumed pacific saury swam along an isotherm celestial cues and magnetic fields can assist the migration orientation for many species e g northcote 1984 sandberg et al 2000 migration along an isotherm can be achieved without special sensory organs because isotherms tend to be distributed zonally on a large scale migration following them is probably an efficient means to migrate in an east west direction doing so also minimally stresses a fish because environmental temperature remains constant migration along an isotherm may apply to migration of other species especially poikilothermic animals because the mechanism by which they can swim along an isotherm is unknown further investigation into the mechanisms and ways pacific saury swim within temperature zones is needed to more accurately validate and improve our migration model the migration routes of individual pacific saury must be measured we validated our model by comparing forecast particle distributions with actual fishing grounds rather than by examining actual pacific saury migrations from pre fishing season particle release points as earlier mentioned tag and recapture methods and biologging technologies would be difficult to apply to pacific saury given their small size and fragility while sakamoto et al 2019 used otolith δ18o to identify migration routes of small japanese sardine bl about 100 mm it may be difficult to apply this method to pacific saury because their otolith is relatively small about 1 130 of its bl compared with that of other fish 1 30 1 50 bl in general iizuka and katayama 2008 once a method can be established and the mechanisms by which pacific saury migrate within preferred temperatures and the speeds at which they migrate determined our migration model could be improved to calculate particle trajectories without a compulsory meridional shift α in eq 1 5 conclusion we developed a migration model for pacific saury that extends from the pre fishing to early fishing seasons based on observed distributions of age 1 fish and their migration characteristics we trialed this model in july 2018 by forecasting locations of early fishing grounds extending into august through to september our migration model successfully forecast the locations of early fishing grounds along the kuril islands archipelago the locations of forecast particles that reached an offshore region approximated actual offshore fishing grounds with any differences between them potentially attributable to slight differences in migration parameters for the first time using our model pacific saury migration routes could be forecast using pre fishing to early fishing season data no previous model had been able to forecast specific locations of fishing grounds we believe that applying our model will improve the efficiency of the pacific saury fishery and operation of its fleet which would reduce fuel costs

24789,pre fishing season june and july pacific saury cololabis saira occur offshore east of japan before migrating west to nearshore waters where they are exploited by japanese fishers in the autumn september november to forecast the location of these fishing grounds we develop a migration model using oceanographic temperature and current velocity and fisheries pre fishing pacific saury distribution obtained from stock assessment surveys data and migration characteristics determined from fishery data analysis we speculate that pacific saury migrate seasonally first north staying within a certain temperature zone from may to july then west remaining within a preferred but gradually increasing temperature zone we tune our model using hindcast calculation to reproduce actual fishing grounds around japan in july 2018 we forecast the locations of early pacific saury fishing grounds from august to september our forecast fishing grounds were subsequently validated by actual positions of the fishing grounds our model successfully forecast the locations of early fishing grounds along the kuril islands archipelago and forecast particles that reached an offshore region roughly predicted offshore fishing grounds this model also identified pacific saury migration route trajectories in detail and that these two fishing grounds in 2018 were formed from geographically separated pre fishing season shoals via different migration routes we believe that applying our model will improve the efficiency of the pacific saury fishery and fleet operation through savings in vessel fuel and time spent searching for shoals keywords pacific saury migration model early fishing ground pre fishing distribution fra roms 1 introduction pacific saury cololabis saira is a small fish that is widely distributed throughout subtropical to subarctic regions of the north pacific hubbs and wisner 1980 this species caught primarily by stick held dip nets is of commercial importance to japan russia korea taiwan and china whereas both japan and russia fish for this species mainly within their exclusive economic zones eezs other countries exploit it within the north pacific high seas huang et al 2007 tseng et al 2014 the life span of pacific saury is short approximately 2 years suyama et al 2006 with fish of 1 year age being the main fishing target its total catch has varied greatly from 18 1 104 tons in 1998 to 63 1 104 tons in 2014 http www fao org fishery species 3001 en until 2000 japan caught more than 70 of the global catch but after 2010 with catch in other countries increasing japan s proportional take of the total catch decreased to less than 50 during their short life cycle pacific saury migrate over a wide area fig 1 their primary spawning ground is in the kuroshio region in the winter watanabe and lo 1989 from here hatched larvae and juveniles are transported east along the kuroshio extension oozeki et al 2015 before migrating north from subtropical regions into subarctic waters from may to july for feeding fukushima 1979 after sufficient growth they commence a return migration towards subtropical spawning grounds in august or september ito et al 2004 tseng et al 2014 during which time the japanese pacific saury fishery starts early fishing grounds for japanese vessels occur mainly along the kuril islands archipelago or around the southeast coast of hokkaido depending on the distribution of the oyashio current fig 1 fukushima 1979 yasuda and kitagawa 1996 it is known that the oyashio forms two tongue shaped intrusions the nearshore oyashio first o1 and the offshore oyashio second o2 intrusion sekine 1988 because fishing grounds around o1 are closer to japanese fishing ports than those of o2 fishing there reduces vessel fuel costs and leads to the landing of fresher fish interannual geographical shifts in the offshore oyashio front correspond with those of pacific saury fishing grounds yasuda and watanabe 1994 previous studies have suggested that the spatial and temporal distributions and migration routes of pacific saury are linked to environmental conditions fukushima 1979 tian et al 2003 watanabe et al 2006 yasuda and watanabe 1994 yasuda and kitagawa 1996 tseng et al 2014 accordingly the areas where early fishing grounds form off japan vary from year to year the primary factor affecting the horizontal distribution of these fish is considered to be temperature watanabe et al 1999 2006 tian et al 2003 tseng et al 2014 with 15 c regarded as preferred huang et al 2007 in addition food density is also important for growth and migration ito et al 2004 oozeki et al 2004 and likely influences the horizontal distribution of these fish since 2003 the tohoku national fisheries research institute tnfri has conducted stock assessment surveys using surface trawls from june to july pre fishing season between 143 e and 165 w tnfri 2018 pre fishing season nearshore pacific saury abundance is low because fish are mainly distributed east of 150 e miyamoto et al 2019 fish later migrate west to recruit into japanese nearshore waters during the main september november fishing season a similar western movement is found in taiwanese fishery data tseng et al 2014 because taiwanese fishing vessels mainly operate in the high seas post august fishing grounds tend to occur along the russian eez boundary from 42 4 n 151 e to 41 5 n 165 e black line in fig 1 therefore migration characteristics discerned from territorial fisheries statistics represent an incomplete picture of the entire life history of this species tnfri stock assessment surveys also reveal fish abundance in waters west of 162 e to have decreased drastically after 2010 which resulted in poor early fishing season catches and delays in formation of early nearshore fishing grounds in japan tnfri 2018 most pacific saury fishermen concern themselves with the time and location of early fishery grounds because initial seasonal products trade at higher prices to this end predictions as to when and where early fishing grounds will form are commercially important and are provided at https www jfa maff go jp j press sigen 190731 html forecasts have historically been made qualitatively based on empirical knowledge when pre fishing season pacific saury occurred nearer to the japanese coast pacific saury reached the main japanese fishing area earlier suyama et al 2012 and vice versa with fishing grounds formed along the oyashio fukushima 1979 yasuda and watanabe 1994 yasuda and kitagawa 1996 until ocean circulation models were developed the future oyashio distribution was determined using a persistence forecast method based on observed hydrographic conditions that is the observed oyashio distribution was assumed to be maintained for 1 2 months this resulted in the forecast tending to fail when the oyashio distribution changed abruptly since 2012 the oyashio distribution has been forecast using fra roms a regional ocean modeling system roms developed by the japan fisheries research and education agency fra kuroda et al 2017 by using the forecast based on physical processes the forecast accuracy of the oyashio distribution has improved forecasts of the timing of the pacific saury fishing ground formation in nearshore japanese waters had been conducted empirically based on the pre fishing fish distribution until miyamoto et al 2019 proposed a new method based on the radius of otolith annual rings using this method we became able to forecast migration dates however this method enable us to determine migration dates regardless of oceanic conditions that vary every year the ability to forecast both the time and location of early fishing grounds taking oceanographic conditions into consideration would represent a considerable improvement on existing forecast methods recent numerical models have simulated the migration of various fish species such as sardine and herring e g megrey et al 2007 okunishi et al 2009 moriarty et al 2016 pacific saury transport processes during their early life stages have also been examined with particle tracking models using observed current velocity fields iwahashi et al 2006 oozeki et al 2015 for adult pacific saury mechanisms controlling growth were examined using a bioenergetics model nemuro fish north pacific ecosystem model for understanding regional oceanography for including saury and herring ito et al 2007 kishi et al 2007 mukai et al 2007 accounting for growth of pacific saury throughout their life history ito et al 2004 for which the influence of ocean warming on fish migration patterns is discussed ito et al 2013 in this model pacific saury migrate among three meridionally distributed oceanographic domains in which the temperature of each is assumed to be constant spatially but to change over time with spatial differences in temperature considered to represent differences among domains this model does not take zonal temperature distributions into consideration and pacific saury migrate south during their spawning migration models including the western migration of fish in two dimensional horizontal temperature and current velocity fields would improve forecasts of early fishing ground times and locations to develop a migration model knowledge about migration characteristics of a target fish is necessary for pacific saury while approximate migration patterns can be estimated fig 1 detailed trajectories of migration routes and the environments experienced during migration are unknown the reason is that tag and recapture methods e g schwarz et al 1993 block et al 2005 and biologging technologies e g cooke et al 2016 are difficult to apply to pacific saury because of their small size and delicate nature for this reason migration model parameters must be estimated from limited data relating to pacific saury distributions and be incorporated into migration model properly therefore the modelling of migration characteristics is an important key to reproduce a plausible migration route because our goal is to improve the accuracy of forecast times and locations of the early pacific saury fishing grounds modelling specialized for forecast migration from pre fishing to early fishing seasons would be effective we endeavor to develop a migration model for pacific saury from pre fishing to early fishing seasons using pre fishing season pacific saury distributions fishery data and oceanic conditions temperature and velocity fields obtained from an ocean circulation model fra roms for the initial distribution of pacific saury we use data on the distribution of age 1 fish obtained from pre fishing season stock assessment surveys we determined migration characteristics from analysis of actual fishing grounds for oceanic conditions we incorporate two dimensional temperature and velocity fields calculated by fra roms then using reanalysis data and 2 month forecasts from fra roms in july 2018 after completing stock assessment surveys we forecast pacific saury distributions 2 months in advance to predict the location of early fishing grounds from august to september our forecast fishing grounds were validated using fishery data on the actual fishing grounds for that year 2 materials methods 2 1 outline of models our migration model for pacific saury uses pre fishing distributions obtained from stock assessment surveys as the initial distribution of pacific saury and two dimensional temperature and velocity fields calculated by fra roms for oceanic conditions as the horizontal resolution of fra roms is 0 1 n 0 1 e the horizontal resolution of our model is the same because the eastern boundary of the fra roms calculation area is 180 our model was also run up to 180 although stock assessment surveys were conducted from 143 e to 165 w daily temperature and velocity fields at the sea surface from 30 n 130 e to 60 n 180 are downloaded from the fra roms web site http fm dc affrc go jp fra roms index html the fra roms output comprises reanalysis and 2 month forecast data reanalysis data are produced using observed meteorological forcing variables assimilating observed temperature salinity and sea surface height the 2 month forecast data are produced under climatological values of meteorological forcing variables without assimilation using the latest reanalysis data as initial oceanographic conditions data are updated weekly our model is developed for simulating age 1 pacific saury migration we assume that pacific saury of body length bl 27 cm represent age 1 fish we assume the averaged bl of age 1 fish is 0 3 m and use this as a standard to calculate swimming speed kurita 2003 reported that the in situ swimming speed is 1 2 2 2 bl s 1 we estimate swimming speed using fishery data and from hindcast calculation using fra roms reanalysis data to forecast the distribution of fishing grounds in 2018 we used pre fishing season survey data and fra roms reanalysis and forecast data forecast results were validated by observed fishery grounds of age 1 pacific saury in that year 2 2 migration model we reproduce the migration of age 1 pacific saury from their pre fishing season june july locations to those of the early fishing season in japan august september using particle tracking with time integration based on lagrangian transport particle trajectories were calculated based on a two dimensional current velocity field at the sea surface generated by fra roms as follows 1 x t d t x t u t u s d t y t d t y t v t v s d t α where x and y represent the eastern and northern locations of a particle at time t respectively and u and v represent the eastern and northern components of current velocity determined by fra roms at a grid including x y respectively eastern us and northern v s fish swimming speeds were determined from analysis of fishery data during the northern migration and hindcast calculation during the spawning migration speeds differed between the northern and spawning migrations the time step dt was set to 30 min and the leap frog scheme was implemented α is a meridional shift term that limits pacific saury to a temperature zone because our calculation area is west of 180 particles reaching the eastern boundary were eliminated from analysis pacific saury seldom occur in the bering and okhotsk seas therefore we use bathymetry in which we treat the depth of these two seas as 0 m treated as land to limit pacific saury to a temperature zone which we assume is preferred we use a two dimensional temperature field at the sea surface in fra roms and incorporate this preferred temperature tp into our model an individual tp value is given to each particle set to the temperature at which particles are released as follows 2 t p i t x 0 i y 0 i t 0 i where i denotes an individual particle t x y t represents the temperature at the sea surface determined by fra roms at a grid including x y in time t x 0 i and y 0 i represent the horizontal coordinates where particle i was released and t 0 i represents the time when particle i was released to restrict pacific saury to a temperature zone we regulate α in eq 1 as follows first we calculate eq 1 setting α 0 and obtain the forecast horizontal coordinate xt yt if t xt yt t tp 0 2 c we search for the nearest y coordinate latitude where tp equals a subdivided point between t xt yt m t and t xt yt m 1 t m is the number of grid units for searching a subdivided point then we shift the particle meridionally to the subdivided point the shift corresponds to α when we search the subdivided point meridionally we set m as 5 to 4 that is the maximum search range as 0 5 n from the northward coordinate of the forecast particle yt this compulsory meridional shift scheme was executed once a day in time integration therefore the maximum shift is 0 5 n day 1 the meridional shift of 0 5 n day 1 is approximately equal to our calculated pacific saury swimming speed of 2 1 bl s 1 comparable to the in situ swimming speed kurita 2003 in most cases the subdivided point occurred within 0 5 n from yt if a point did not exist we set α 0 that is a meridional shift did not occur such cases occurred for particles distributed adjacent to the coast our migration model calculation started from the first date when pacific saury were caught in stock assessment surveys for hindcast calculation trajectories from june to september were calculated using fra roms reanalysis data for forecast calculation we used reanalysis data and 2 month forecast data from fra roms the initial distribution of pacific saury was set according to pre fishing distributions of fish obtained from stock assessment surveys we released particles for tracking at locations where trawl observations were conducted on dates when age 1 pacific saury were caught x 0 i y 0 i at t 0 i 2 3 estimation of migration speed and preferred temperature during the northern migration catch per unit effort cpue data for pacific saury tons day 1 and temperature data at the sea surface in high seas from may to july in 2007 2015 fig 2 a obtained by the marine fisheries research and development center jamarc of the japan fisheries research and education agency were analyzed we calculated the locations of fishing centers weighted by cpue for every 10 days from early may to late july as mentioned in our results fishing center latitudes were significantly correlated with date revealing the northern migration of fish from may to july to compare this northern migration of the fishing center to temporal change in temperature we estimated the latitudes of the 11 14 c isothermal lines in the pre fishing season distribution of pacific saury 155 170 e for 2007 2015 using daily two dimensional temperature fields at the sea surface from fra roms the latitudes of these isothermal lines were averaged zonally for every 10 days the rate of northern movement of pacific saury fishery centers 0 1 m s 1 fig 2b coincided with the rate of northern movement of sea surface water of 13 c fig 3 approximately 0 3 bl s 1 which is considerably below the swimming speed of age 1 pacific saury reported by kurita 2003 based on this we assume that pacific saury migrate within a certain temperature zone tp following the northward movement of an isotherm until the end of july rather than swimming continuously in a fixed direction accordingly we set us and v s at zero and held tp constant during the northern migration although swimming speed is zero particles move north and remain within a certain temperature zone through α 2 4 estimating migration speed and preferred temperature during the spawning migration we analyzed japanese fishing vessel using stick held dip nets data from august to november 2003 2017 to investigate tp during the spawning migration we estimated the centers of fishing grounds and temperature weighted by cpue for every 10 days temperature at the center of fishing grounds from august to november increased linearly at 0 295 c every 10 days as the fishing center moved south fig 4 b from this result we assume the spawning migration starts after 1 august and tp increases at this rate during the spawning migration because pacific saury migrate from far offshore east of 150 e to nearshore japan westward migration occurs miyamoto et al 2019 to migrate west staying within a temperature zone we assume that pacific saury swim along a predominantly zonally distributed isotherm swimming direction along an isotherm was calculated from the two dimensional temperature field of fra roms temperature gradients at particles were calculated using adjacent grid point temperature values and swimming direction us v s was set to a direction orthogonal to this temperature gradient towards the west a conceptual diagram of our migration model is presented in fig 5 absolute swimming speed u s 2 v s 2 in the spawning migration is an unknown parameter we determined this by hindcast calculation for which modeled particles accurately predicted the actual centers of early japanese fishing grounds in mid september from 2010 to 2017 when pacific saury were distributed further east than before 2010 to evaluate the model s reproducibility we calculated the fishing center weighted by cpue using the top 20 of the fishing ground locations closest to the southwest the top 20 of hindcast particles closest to the southwestern area were used for comparison we evaluated the reproducibility of hindcast calculation by the averaged distance between this fishing center and these particles in mid september of each year for hindcast calculation we conducted case studies in which swimming speeds were set at 1 5 3 0 bl s 1 at 0 5 bl s 1 increments because the actual fishing grounds and hindcast particles were closest at a swimming speed of 2 5 bl s 1 fig 6 we set a swimming speed of 0 75 m s 1 for the spawning migration 2 5 forecast calculation in mid july 2018 after completion of stock assessment surveys with our migration model we forecast the location of early fishing grounds from august to mid september in 2018 from june to 14 july we used fra roms reanalysis temperature and current velocity fields followed by through to 15 september 2 month forecast data in our model we released 26 particles that correspond to surface trawl survey dates swimming speed was that estimated from fishery data analysis and hindcast calculations zero for the northern migration until 31 july and 2 5 bl s 1 for the spawning migration after 1 august after 1 august we increased tp by 0 295 c every 10 days forecast results were validated by the locations of actual early fishery grounds in that year to quantitatively evaluate our forecast results we calculated the distance between the center of the actual fishery grounds and the top 20 of particles that were closest to the southwestern area comparable to our hindcast calculations section 2 4 3 results 3 1 northern and spawning migration characteristics the spatial and temporal distributions of fishery grounds in may circles june crosses and july triangles from 2007 to 2015 jamarc data are depicted in fig 2a fishing grounds are distributed widely and discontinuously between 146 e and 173 e because fisheries operated in the high seas a distribution limited by the boundary with the russian eez is apparent fishing vessels could pursue a fish shoal to the eez boundary but once a shoal moved into russia s eez then vessels ceased fishing and had to search for another high seas shoal when weather was severe fishing vessels also had to leave fishing grounds and find new grounds when the weather improved therefore data represent an incomplete account of pacific saury migration the center of the fishing grounds moved from 39 0 41 6 n in may to 42 5 45 8 n in july fig 2b the fishing center latitude was significantly positively related to date r 0 89 p 0 001 fishing center longitude and the temperature at the sea surface varied considerably fig 2c 2d and did not significantly correlate with date r 0 07 and 0 13 respectively p 0 7 while the fishing center latitude increased from may to july there was no significant relationship between temperature at the sea surface and the fishing center r 0 31 p 0 3 fig 2e the latitudes of the 11 14 c isotherms estimated from two dimensional temperature fields at the sea surface of fra roms in the pre fishing season distribution of pacific saury are shown in figs 3a d with the latitude of the center of the fishing grounds lines in fig 2b isotherms moved north from may to july movement of the 13 c isotherm was most consistently related to the northward movement of the fishing center fig 3c the rate of northward movement of the isotherm is estimated at 0 1 m s 1 because the rate is slower than the swimming speed of age 1 pacific saury kurita 2003 we assume that pacific saury migrate north within a certain temperature zone tp rather than swimming continuously in a fixed direction fishing center 10 day averaged latitudes and the temperature at the sea surface during the spawning migration were estimated from japanese fishery data between the months of august and november for the years spanning 2003 2017 fig 4 for some years there were no or limited data in early august and late november the fishing center latitude gradually decreased from mid august to mid november while the temperature at the sea surface at the fishing center gradually increased from early august to mid november fig 4b from this result we assume the spawning migration started after 1 august based on least square fit analysis the increase rate of temperature at the sea surface from august to november was estimated at 0 295 c every 10 days indicating preferred temperature increased with the pacific saury southern migration swimming speed during the spawning migration was determined from hindcast calculation the top 20 of hindcast particles reaching the southwestern area were compared with the top 20 of fishing grounds closest to the southwest fig 6 the estimated location of the fishing center in mid september 2014 was 42 5 n 145 9 e cross symbols in figs 6a c hindcast particles at a swimming speed of 2 0 bl s 1 occurred around 147 e not reaching this center fig 6a those of swimming speed 2 5 bl s 1 occurred around the fishing center fig 6b some particles at a swimming speed of 3 0 bl s 1 overshot the fishing center and were transported west of 144 e fig 6c in other years between 2010 and 2017 hindcast particles at a swimming speed 2 5 bl s 1 closely approximated the actual positions of the fishing grounds averaged distances between fishing centers and the top 20 of hindcast particles reaching the southwestern area in 2010 2017 were 303 7 181 7 134 4 and 150 4 km for swimming speeds of 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 bl s 1 respectively fig 6d accordingly we assume the swimming speed during the spawning migration to be 2 5 bl s 1 corresponding to 0 75 m s 1 3 2 forecasting early fishing grounds forecast particle distributions for 20 and 31 august and 15 september 2018 are shown in fig 7 on 20 august the westernmost particle reached 45 0 n 149 4 e other particles occurred along the kuril islands archipelago from 46 6 n 151 9 e to 48 5 n 155 5 e fig 7a the temperature where these particles occurred ranged 11 13 c at the sea surface with this lower temperature corresponding to the oyashio current fig 8 a the initial distributions crosses in fig 7 of these particles were at 155 e or 159 e relatively nearshore western stations from the japanese coast trajectories revealed these particles migrated north to around the kamchatka peninsula then southwest along the kuril islands archipelago on 31 august westernmost forecast particles occurred along the kuril islands archipelago from 45 5 n 149 5 e to 47 2 n 152 5 e fig 7b at sea surface temperatures ranging 11 13 c fig 8b these particles are the same as those found along the kuril islands archipelago on 20 august which indicates a southwestern movement of fish shoals on 15 september some particles occurred along the kuril islands archipelago and two particles occurred about 300 km offshore off etorofu island 41 8 n 148 0 e fig 7c the former were initially distributed in relatively nearshore stations as before 20 and 31 august but the latter two particles migrated from stations further offshore 171 e the initial release latitudes of these two particles were about 40 n and were the southernmost stations at which pacific saury were caught in 2018 stock assessment surveys initial tp where these two particles were released 14 3 c and 15 1 c were the highest for all released particles their trajectories revealed that they had migrated zonally west to east through a high temperature area in contrast to particles distributed along the kuril islands archipelago fig 8c of the particles released east of 160 e 60 did not travel westward across 160 e until mid september 3 3 forecast validation japanese stick held dip net fishing grounds in mid august 2018 formed in two areas along the kuril islands archipelago around 45 n 149 e black squares in fig 9 a and 47 n 153 e gray squares in fig 9a the first of these areas the southwest corresponded to our forecast westernmost particle on 20 august 45 0 n 149 4 e red circle in fig 9a the distance between the location of this particle and the fishing center in the southwest fishing area black cross in fig 9a was 20 4 km the second northeast area corresponded to the remainder of the top 20 of particles closest to southwestern area orange circles in fig 9a the average distance between these subsequent particles and the fishing center gray cross in fig 9a was 110 4 km late august fishing grounds formed from 45 0 47 6 n and 152 8 154 1 e similar to mid august northeastern fishing grounds along the kuril islands archipelago squares in fig 9b the top 20 of particles closest to the southwestern area were also distributed along the archipelago red circles in fig 9b the westernmost two of these reached west of 152 e where no fishing grounds occurred four forecast particles including one of the remaining 80 of particles black circles corresponded to fishing grounds the average distance between the centers of fishing grounds cross in fig 9b and the top 20 of particles closest to the southwestern area red circles in fig 9b was 135 6 km except for the two preceding particles the average distance was 70 6 km in mid september fishing grounds formed in the southwest 40 7 42 5 n 149 4 152 5 e black squares in fig 9c and northeast 45 7 46 6 n and 154 0 155 0 e gray squares in fig 9c areas the southwest fishing grounds occurred offshore and formed here for the first time that year two particles red circles in fig 9c were distributed west of this southwest fishing area the average distance between these two particles and the southwestern center of fishing grounds black cross in fig 9c was 301 2 km except for these two particles the top 20 of particles closest to the southwestern area orange circles in fig 9c were distributed west of the northeast fishing area the average distance between these particles and the fishing center gray cross in fig 9c was 372 2 km however the locations of several particles found between 45 9 n and 47 8 n and 152 0 e and 155 4 e were almost consistent with northeastern fishing grounds the average distance between the fishing center in the northeast area and forecast particles around it blue circles in fig 9c was 103 7 km 4 discussion our migration model forecasts the distributions of early fishing grounds for pacific saury in nearshore japanese waters using two dimensional temperature and velocity fields derived from fra roms our initial distributions of pacific saury were based on observed pre fishing season distributions obtained by tnfri northern and spawning migration characteristics were estimated from analysis of actual fishing grounds we estimated swimming speed of pacific saury during the spawning migration based on hindcast calculations that faithfully reproduced actual fishing grounds thus our migration model is based on actual pacific saury migration characteristics and hydrographic conditions with high reproducibility our migration model represents progress on that of miyamoto et al 2019 for which predicted migration dates of pacific saury were based on relationships between pre fishing distribution longitude and western fish migration velocity only regardless of oceanic conditions we believe application of our model will improve the efficiency of the pacific saury fishery and fleet operation by saving vessel fuel and the time spent searching for fish shoals we tested our model in 2018 by predicting the locations of early fishing grounds these predictions were validated by actual fishing ground positions fig 9 in the 2018 fishing season in mid august our forecast particles were distributed around two fishing grounds along the kuril islands archipelago fig 9a differences between fishing centers and the forecast particles around them were 20 4 and 110 4 km for the southwest and northeast fishing areas respectively in late august two preceding forecast particles reached west of 152 e fig 9b where no fishing grounds occurred the locations of subsequent particles were consistent with actual fishing grounds separated from its center by an average distance of 70 6 km the westernmost particles along the kuril islands archipelago in mid september orange circles in fig 9c were located at an average distance of 372 2 km from the northeast fishing center gray cross in fig 9c however subsequent forecast particles blue circles in fig 9c were distributed around the fishing ground separated from its center by an average distance of 103 7 km thus after mid august the average distance between the centers of fishing grounds and the locations of forecast particles along the kuril islands archipelago ranged 20 4 110 4 km similar to or lower than distances estimated from hindcast calculation for 2010 2017 ranging 77 1 187 9 km averaging 134 4 km fig 6d given these results we consider our migration model successfully forecast fishing grounds that formed along this archipelago early in the fishing season because forecast particles reproduce actual fishing grounds we regard the migration trajectories obtained from our model to be plausible and that our model successfully identified detailed migration routes of pacific saury from pre fishing to early fishing grounds our model s migration trajectories revealed pacific saury along the kuril islands archipelago originated from areas relatively near to the coast of japan 155 e or 159 e our forecast identified fishing grounds would occur in mid september about 300 km off etorofu island red circles in fig 9c although these forecast particles proved to be located 301 2 km west of the actual fishing center black cross in fig 9c at a swimming speed of 0 75 m s 1 64 8 km day 1 during the spawning migration fish could travel this distance in 4 6 days if constantly migrating westward because our analysis is based primarily on 10 day averaged data we deemed our forecast for offshore fishing grounds to be a success possible reasons for differences between forecast and actual fishing positions are discussed below forecast trajectories revealed these offshore fishing grounds were formed by pacific saury that had migrated from stations further offshore in 171 e we consider that it would have been impossible to forecast the location of fishing grounds off etorofu island using traditional empirical forecast methods pacific saury that were initially distributed around 171 e reached japanese nearshore waters earlier than those that were distributed in more western areas in mid september indicating the former had migrated west faster than the latter this observation is consistent with miyamoto et al 2019 wherein it was reported that the migration speed of pacific saury in the western area during the pre fishing season had a slower migration speed than those further east although swimming speed is constant at 2 5 bl s 1 during the spawning migration in our migration model they reached the nearshore area earlier most likely because they migrated directly west to east without a northward detour their northern migration route is shorter than for other fish these fish were initially distributed in higher temperature 14 15 c waters during the pre fishing season their northern migration route was relatively short because the 14 15 c isotherm had not moved as far north as had lower isothermal lines that year the majority 60 of particles released east of 160 e did not travel westward across 160 e until mid september fig 7c hindcast calculation from june to november revealed that approximately 80 of released particles reached the coast of japan by late november this suggests that pacific saury shoals distributed in offshore regions subsequently migrate to nearshore waters of japan as the fishing season progresses the remaining 20 of particles migrated southward in offshore regions previous studies have reported that pacific saury spawning grounds are distributed from nearshore to offshore regions along the kuroshio and the kuroshio extension iwahashi et al 2006 baitaliuk et al 2013 oozeki et al 2015 we consider these 20 of southward migrating particles to have contributed to spawning in offshore waters while our predictions successfully identified early fishing grounds there were minor discrepancies in the forecast positions of fish shoals and the actual centers of fishing grounds several particles were found southwest of actual fishing grounds in late august fig 9b and mid september orange circles in fig 9c along the kuril islands archipelago assuming pacific saury abundance represented by each particle is proportional to stock assessment survey trawl catch and that abundance does not change between the pre and early fishing seasons the abundance of pacific saury represented by these particles was lower than that of other particles along the kuril islands archipelago accordingly we feel that pacific saury abundance was higher in actual fishing grounds than it was in the southwestern area alternatively preceding shoals these particles were considered to have been caught by mid august causing decreased abundance because fishing grounds formed in mid august for these reasons the area around 46 47 n 153 154 e is considered to have been selected as the fishing grounds after late august fishery data does not cover the entire distribution of pacific saury and fishing grounds are not only selected by pacific saury abundance but artificial factors also more accurate validation of forecasts requires scientific surveys to determine pacific saury abundance in areas in which forecast particles occur the locations of mid september forecast particles off etorofu island were 301 2 km west of the actual offshore fishing grounds red circles and black cross in fig 9c because the fra roms forecast calculation is driven by climatological data of meteorological conditions the 2 month forecast temperatures and current velocities are less accurate than those of reanalysis data the decreased accuracy in our model s oceanographic conditions may contribute to differences in forecast and actual fishing fleet positions to clarify the influence of 2 month fra roms forecast data we conducted hindcast calculations using reanalysis data for 2018 two particles reached 42 n 149 e approximately 200 km west of the center of the offshore fishing ground the accuracy in oceanic conditions influence accuracy of forecast migration but room for improvement remains the timing of the switch from northern to spawning migration we use 1 august based on fishery data also contributes to differences in the distributions of forecast particles and actual fishing grounds the switching time probably varies with fish body size and condition with larger or more mature pacific saury possibly commencing their spawning migration earlier than smaller thinner or less mature fish forecast calculation with a spawning migration commencing on 5 august had the shortest average distance 78 6 km between the center of offshore fishing grounds and the forecast particle locations therefore when the spawning migration commences strongly influences the accuracy of the forecast the proportion of age 1 fish in the two shoals from off etorofu island was approximately 40 which means that shoals comprised mainly age 0 fish therefore a spawning migration commencement delay may occur swimming speed during the spawning migration might also affect forecasts while we used a speed of 2 5 bl s 1 in our model slight differences in this can contribute to large differences in particle location over long periods of integration time the centers of offshore fishing grounds and forecast particle locations were shortest average distance 64 8 km at a swimming speed of 2 3 bl s 1 which indicates that swimming speed does strongly influence the accuracy of a forecast if swimming speed is proportional to bl differences in average bl between different shoals would affect dispersal differences we used an average bl for age 1 fish of 30 cm for example a shoal which consists of relatively larger age 1 pacific saury body length 32 33 cm may move faster than one which consists of relatively smaller individuals body length 27 28 cm the average bl of age 1 pacific saury in the two shoals to reach waters off etorofu island was same as for other shoals however because these shoals comprised largely age 0 fish a reduced swimming speed may occur although the estimated time delay 4 days and reduction of swimming speed 0 2 bl s 1 are quite small a difference of hundreds of km in distance traveled results it is presently difficult to detail migration characteristics for each shoal but if we could do so and incorporate this information into our model then its forecast accuracy would be improved further investigation into the cues that pacific saury use to switch from northern to spawning migrations and the swimming speed during the spawning migration is needed another limitation of our model is the small number of particles that we could release because the initial distributions of particles were based on pre fishing season stock assessment surveys shoals that were not identified in surveys likely contribute to the formation of fishing grounds in nearshore japanese waters therefore our model does not have the accuracy that fishing grounds will not form where forecast particles are not distributed it is difficult to increase the number of surface trawl stations because of limitations in ship time to adopt actual august fishing ground positions as data on the initial distribution of pacific saury for our model would improve forecast distributions for and beyond september additionally by repeatedly updating our initial pacific saury distributions and forecast oceanographic conditions our model could forecast fishing ground positions for the entire fishing season august november analysis of fishing grounds reveals pacific saury swim within a temperature zone during their northern and spawning migrations during the northern migration fish move at about 0 3 bl s 1 0 1 m s 1 a rate differing from their actual instantaneous swimming speed pacific saury probably swim faster e g 1 2 bl s 1 during this migration but because they do not continuously swim in a fixed direction their temporally averaged swimming rate migration speed is slower than their instantaneous swimming speed the daily ration of pacific saury is high during their northern migration kurita and sugisaki 2004 so they likely swim in search of food further slowing their migration speed during the spawning migration pacific saury move west remaining within a preferred temperature zone to incorporate this process in our migration model we assumed pacific saury swam along an isotherm celestial cues and magnetic fields can assist the migration orientation for many species e g northcote 1984 sandberg et al 2000 migration along an isotherm can be achieved without special sensory organs because isotherms tend to be distributed zonally on a large scale migration following them is probably an efficient means to migrate in an east west direction doing so also minimally stresses a fish because environmental temperature remains constant migration along an isotherm may apply to migration of other species especially poikilothermic animals because the mechanism by which they can swim along an isotherm is unknown further investigation into the mechanisms and ways pacific saury swim within temperature zones is needed to more accurately validate and improve our migration model the migration routes of individual pacific saury must be measured we validated our model by comparing forecast particle distributions with actual fishing grounds rather than by examining actual pacific saury migrations from pre fishing season particle release points as earlier mentioned tag and recapture methods and biologging technologies would be difficult to apply to pacific saury given their small size and fragility while sakamoto et al 2019 used otolith δ18o to identify migration routes of small japanese sardine bl about 100 mm it may be difficult to apply this method to pacific saury because their otolith is relatively small about 1 130 of its bl compared with that of other fish 1 30 1 50 bl in general iizuka and katayama 2008 once a method can be established and the mechanisms by which pacific saury migrate within preferred temperatures and the speeds at which they migrate determined our migration model could be improved to calculate particle trajectories without a compulsory meridional shift α in eq 1 5 conclusion we developed a migration model for pacific saury that extends from the pre fishing to early fishing seasons based on observed distributions of age 1 fish and their migration characteristics we trialed this model in july 2018 by forecasting locations of early fishing grounds extending into august through to september our migration model successfully forecast the locations of early fishing grounds along the kuril islands archipelago the locations of forecast particles that reached an offshore region approximated actual offshore fishing grounds with any differences between them potentially attributable to slight differences in migration parameters for the first time using our model pacific saury migration routes could be forecast using pre fishing to early fishing season data no previous model had been able to forecast specific locations of fishing grounds we believe that applying our model will improve the efficiency of the pacific saury fishery and operation of its fleet which would reduce fuel costs
