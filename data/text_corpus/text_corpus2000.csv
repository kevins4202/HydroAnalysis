10000,laser land levelling is expanding rapidly in the rice wheat rw and maize wheat mw systems of the indo gangetic plains of india and pakistan current practice is to level to zero 0 gradient whereas a small gradient e g 0 1 is typically used in developed countries therefore experiments were conducted in farmers plots 15 m x 40 m in the eastern gangetic plains to evaluate laser levelling with a 0 1 gradient in comparison with 0 and farmer levelling practice fl the study was conducted over two years in rw and mw systems in the mw system raised beds in plots lasered with 0 and 0 1 gradients were also evaluated laser levelling with 0 gradient significantly reduced irrigation amount and or increased irrigation water productivity wpi in all crops systems grown on the flat compared to fl except for wheat in the mw system while there was a consistent trend for higher yield with a 0 gradient compared with fl the differences were not significant in any crop system for the rw system the results suggest no to marginal benefits in irrigation amount and wpi from levelling with a 0 1 gradient in comparison with 0 gradient in that system by far the bigger gains were from changing from fl to laser levelling with 0 gradient this resulted in substantial reductions in irrigation amount which greatly increased wpi in both crops by 40 while yield was not affected rice grown with fl was not profitable but lasering with 0 gradient significantly increased gross margin for rice wheat and the total rw system as for the rw system levelling to 0 with a flat configuration significantly increased wpi of both crops in the mw system compared to fl but by a lesser proportion raised beds significantly increased yield of maize by 8 0 5 t ha 1 reduced irrigation amount by 20 40 mm and increased wpi by 34 1 0 kg m 3 in comparison with the laser levelled flat plots gross margin of the mw system on beds was 17 20 higher than fl and gross margin with beds on a 0 1 gradient was significantly higher than either gradient on the flat the results suggest that the gains from levelling with a 0 1 gradient compared to 0 are marginal however this may change if the goal of consolidation of small farmer plots into larger fields becomes a reality provided there is a proportionate increase in irrigation flow rates and ability to drain keywords raised beds slope advance time intake opportunity time mechanical transplanting bihar 1 introduction sustainability of the annual growth in rice and wheat production is one of the prime concerns for india to feed its fast growing population given the limited prospects for substantial and sustainable increases in crop production in northwest india the home of the green revolution the country has policies and or programs for a second green revolution in eastern india pathak et al 2019 key attributes of eastern india are large yield gaps and large and untapped groundwater resources suggesting high potential to greatly increase crop productivity to help feed the nation mohanty et al 2017 laser assisted land levelling laser levelling is one technology helping to reduce the yield gap and its use is expanding rapidly in the indo gangetic plains igp of south asia with 1 5 mha laser levelled by 2015 jat et al 2015 in the igp irrigated rice wheat rw systems predominate while maize wheat mw systems are becoming increasingly important especially in the eastern igp the reasons for the popularity of laser levelling include i reduced irrigation amount mathankar et al 2005 abdullaev et al 2007 and improved uniformity of water application and consequently yield aryal et al 2015 jat et al 2015 ii increased cultivable land area through the reduction of bunds and channels naresh et al 2014 iii reduced weed density in rice rickman 2002 iv increased input use fertilizer pesticide etc efficiency jat et al 2011 and v more efficient machinery operations and improved crop establishment jat et al 2006 in the rw systems of pakistan adoption of laser land levelling has been shown to have positive impacts on wheat and rice yields and household income ali et al 2018 in the igp the fields are laser levelled to create a zero gradient both across and down from head to tail the field in contrast in developed countries a small gradient e g 0 08 0 2 in 100 700 m long fields in parts of australia is common for irrigated upland crops grown in both flat border check and bed layouts carroll et al 1995 khanna et al 2003 hamilton et al 2005 for rice upland systems in australia lasered contour layouts with a small gradient 0 4 0 5 across the plots perpendicular to the contours are often used to facilitate drainage a gradient from head to tail produces more rapid advance of the waterfront down the field reducing the duration of each irrigation drainage beyond the bottom of the root zone deep drainage and waterlogging an optimal gradient can reduce irrigation amount in upland crops by up to 20 walker et al 2006 bautista et al 2009 gonzález et al 2011 irrigation duration and drainage losses are also strongly influenced by inlet flow rate cut off time length and area of the field and soil type smith and uddin 2020 all these factors need to be considered in designing layouts and irrigation management that provide sufficient irrigation water intake opportunity time to wet the root zone across the field as uniformly as possible while minimizing deep drainage losses playan et al 1996 playán and mateos 2006 walker et al 2006 while the benefits of laser levelling with zero gradient in both directions have been well established in the small irrigation plots used by farmers in the igp jat et al 2015 whether levelling with a small gradient would confer further benefits in terms of yield and or irrigation water productivity wpi has not been considered in the study area of bihar state in eastern india field size is typically 1 acre 64 m 64 m for rice the field is divided into irrigation plots separated by earthen bunds of width typically ranging from 10 to 30 m and length from 20 to 60 m for wheat the rice plots are sub divided into shorter and narrower bunded plots aiming for more efficient irrigation in the eastern gangetic plains rice wheat and maize are the major food and fodder crops rice and maize are grown during the monsoon season june to september mostly on rainfall but with supplemental irrigation maize is also grown in the relatively dry rabi winter season in some pockets of the region unreliable amounts and distribution of rainfall adversely affect the timeliness of establishment of rice and thus the subsequent wheat crop grown in winter reducing the yield of both crops balwinder singh et al 2019 in addition periods of water deficit stress especially increased terminal drought stress resulting from delayed transplanting reduce yield in rice balwinder singh et al 2019 in this region rainfall has decreased during the period of rice establishment july and august and rainfall variability has increased over the past 30 years subash et al 2011 naidu et al 2017 puddling and transplanting of rice are delayed until the start of the monsoon rains due to the late arrival after the start of the monsoon of low cost canal water and the high cost of pumping groundwater farmers are faced with the choice of late transplanting with old seedlings and thus reduced yield or leaving the field fallow options for more timely establishment of crops and lower irrigation amount for crop establishment include mechanical transplanting of rice into non puddled soil np mtr yadav et al 2017 kar et al 2018 and switching to maize kumar et al 2018 it is also well established that the use of safe alternate wetting and drying water management for rice awd reduces irrigation amount while maintaining yield noting that a short period e g 10 15 days of ponding immediately after transplanting is recommended rejesus et al 2011 lampayan et al 2015 zero tillage zt and planting of both wheat and maize on raised beds have also been shown to reduce irrigation amount while maintaining or increasing yield in the eastern igp jat et al 2019 singh et al 2020 as in other parts of the igp ladha et al 2008 given the above a study was conducted to determine whether laser levelling with a small gradient would confer additional benefits in rw and mw systems implemented using the most promising technologies for the region i e zt for wheat in both systems np mtr grown with awd in the rw system and raised beds in the mw system the hypotheses were i laser levelling with a small 0 1 gradient will increase the rate of advance of the wetting front and reduce irrigation input to all crops compared with zero gradient ii laser levelling with 0 1 gradient will not affect rice yield iii laser levelling with 0 1 gradient will increase the yield of maize and wheat crops grown in flat configurations because of reduced waterlogging iv raised beds will increase the yield of maize and wheat and reduce irrigation input and v laser levelling with 0 1 gradient will not affect the yield of crops grown on beds thus the objectives of this study were to determine the effects of land gradient slope and configuration bed and flat on the intake opportunity time irrigation amount yield and irrigation water productivity wpi of rice wheat and maize crops grown in rw and mw cropping systems in eastern india 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites and soil on farm experiments were conducted from 2014 to 2016 in three neighbouring villages vaishali chak ramdas and bania in vaishali district of bihar state in india fig 1 the villages are located around 26 00 n latitude and 85 06 e longitude the experiments were conducted in collaboration with the local non government organization vaishali area small farmers association vasfa which was engaged in installing deep tubewells and promoting laser land levelling and improved crop establishment methods vaishali district is located within an extensive alluvial plain deposited by the ganga and the gandak rivers ash grey silt silt clay clayey silt soils predominate and can be broadly grouped into two categories entisols and inceptisols the texture of the soil in the experimental plots is clay loam with varying contents of sand and silt table s1 mean volumetric soil water content of the top soil 0 30 cm at field capacity 10 kpa is 32 cm3 cm 3 the climate of the region is sub tropical to sub humid with a rainy season from mid june to the end of september during which about 85 of annual rainfall is received tarafdar and agrawal 2013 all fields had a long history of growing puddled transplanted rice followed by conventional tillage wheat 2 2 experimental design and treatments two researcher led on farm experiments one each for the rw and mw systems were conducted for two years 2014 2016 commencing with rice or maize grown during the rainy season in 2014 each treatment was replicated three times an individual farmer s field serving as one replicate in the rw system three land gradient treatments 0 0 and 0 1 gradient created by laser levelling and farmers practice of levelling fl were compared fig 2 in the mw system four treatments with combinations of two laser levelled gradients 0 and 0 1 and two configurations raised beds flat were compared with fl the fields were re levelled prior to each rainy season crop to ensure that slope was retained 2 3 crop management 2 3 1 land preparation and crop establishment the fields to be laser levelled were dry ploughed three times using tyne cultivators before creating the land gradients all implements were drawn by a 55 hp 4 wheel tractor the gradient was verified using a laser land leveller receiver and transmitter after completion of land levelling plot size varied across replicates i e farmers fields 32 46 m long 14 16 m wide so the 0 1 gradient resulted in 3 2 4 6 cm difference in elevation between the head irrigation inlet and the tail ends of individual plots laser levelling was done each year prior to establishment of the rice or maize for the mw system raised beds 67 cm between the centres of adjacent beds width across the flat bed top 37 cm furrow width 30 cm furrow depth 15 cm were formed after laser levelling using a bed shaper preparation of fields for fl rice and maize typically involved two dry soil ploughings using a tyne cultivator with a trailing wooden plank drawn by a 55 hp 4 wheel tractor there was no puddling in any of the rice treatments and there was no tillage prior to sowing wheat in any treatment in both systems details of field layout crop establishment and management in the lasered treatments are provided in fig 2 and table s2 and briefly summarized here within each crop the method of establishment was the same across all treatments both laser levelled and fl in both the rw and mw systems row direction in all plots was from head to tail i e in the direction of the slope for rice the fields were irrigated and 15 day old seedlings were planted in the shallow flooded soil using a six row transplanter with 20 cm 20 cm spacing wheat was sown at 120 kg ha 1 using an 11 row seed cum fertilizer zero till drill with row spacing of 18 cm in both flat and bed plots the t openers sowing in the slopes of the beds were adjusted so that the seed was also buried the maize was dibbled manually following a pre sowing irrigation and a pre sowing application of glyphosate row spacing was 67 5 cm plant spacing 20 cm and in the bed plots the maize was planted in the middle of the bed tops a spade was used to create a slot in the moist soil into which the seed was dropped and the slot was closed by gently pressing with foot or spade 2 3 2 crop management for rice and maize hybrid varieties were used while a long duration inbred variety of wheat was used in both systems table s2 the same variety and recommended fertilizer rates and sowing transplanting weed and pest management were used in all treatments within each crop all the phosphorus p and potassium k fertilizer were applied at the time of transplanting rice or sowing maize and wheat except that the k fertilizer was broadcast with the 1st topdressing of nitrogen n fertilizer in wheat the p was applied as dap and the top dressed n was applied as urea in 3 splits in rice and two splits in wheat and maize weeds were well controlled through the use of herbicides and manual weeding in rice and maize in wheat one application of the herbicide sulfosulfuron metsulfuron methyl total controlled most of weed species including phalaris minor broadleaf weeds and other narrow leaf weeds and sedges including cyperus species the crops were irrigated by pumping groundwater from a supply canal at the head of the plots through a pipe diameter 75 mm in the centre of the bund the pumping rate was adjusted during each irrigation of individual plots to achieve a constant flow rate during and across irrigations the discharge rate of the pump was higher during irrigation of rice 12 6 4 0 l s 1 than wheat 7 1 1 8 l s 1 in the rw system in the mw system discharge rates were similar for maize 5 9 1 9 l s 1 and wheat 6 6 1 9 l s 1 irrigations were scheduled according to soil water tension one tensiometer was installed near the centre of the head mid and tail sections of each plot fig 2 at 15 cm soil depth in rice and at 32 5 cm in wheat and maize the tensiometers were read daily the crops were irrigated within 1 2 days after average soil water tension had increased to 10 35 and 50 kpa in rice wheat and maize respectively fig s1 irrigation was ceased cut off as soon the irrigation front the water flowing over the soil surface reached a peg at the mid point of the bottom edge of the plot the same criteria for irrigation scheduling and cut off were applied to all treatments within each crop each year there was no back up of drainage water in the ditch at the tail end of the experimental plots as the water was able to drain freely into the end of the adjacent farmers field at each site which was 10 50 cm lower in the landscape in typical farmers practice irrigation plot size for rice in this region ranges from 20 to 60 m length and 10 30 m width and the fields are puddled then levelled with wooden plank drawn by a tractor for wheat the rice plots are sub divided into 4 sections the plots are typically flood irrigated using groundwater delivered to individual plots using flexible pipe the groundwater is pumped using 6 5 hp diesel operated pumps giving discharge rates into plots of 4 17 l s 1 depending on the distance from the plot and hydraulic head generally farmers re irrigate rice depending on water availability and affordability when the soil surface begins to crack i e the cracks could be larger than hairline and add enough water to achieve a standing water depth of 5 15 cm three to five 3 5 irrigations are common for rice for wheat 2 4 irrigations are common applied at crown root initiation n fertilizer topdressing twice and flowering if four with plots flooded to a depth of 3 5 cm for rainy season maize 1 2 irrigations are generally applied at seedling and tassling silking the need for the later irrigation based on temporary wilting of the upper leaf with the soil flooded to 3 5 cm depth 2 4 measurements and observations 2 4 1 weather data daily rainfall and air temperature were extracted from era5 daily aggregates using the google earth engine gee rain gauges were installed in 3 locations but gaps in the data necessitated an alternative approach this approach provides data at 0 25 arc degrees equivalent to 25 km resolution at the latitude of vaishali daily climate reanalysis parameters on total precipitation and mean 2 m air temperature both at 0 25 arc degree of era5 which is the fifth generation atmospheric reanalysis of ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasts global climate were extracted using the gee in gee image collection for precipitation and temperature layers from era5 was defined a geographical location of the study area was assigned with date range filter and data were extracted as csv files daily solar radiation data of the same time range were downloaded from the nasa power national aeronautics and space administration prediction of worldwide energy resources website which provides data at 1 arc degree spatial resolution 2 4 2 grain yield grain yield was determined from areas harvested at six locations in each plot two within each of the head middle and tail sections rice and wheat were harvested from 4 m2 quadrats and maize from 9 m2 at each of the 6 locations for all crops grain yield was expressed in t ha 1 at 14 moisture content determined by oven drying the grain at 65 c for 72 h 2 4 3 water advance recession and intake opportunity time 2 4 3 1 rice and maize twelve bamboo sticks were installed to form a rectangular grid in each plot for monitoring the advance and recession of the irrigation water the plots were divided into three sections head middle tail of equal length and three sticks were placed at positions ¼ ½ and ¾ the way across the middle of each section an additional row of three sticks was placed near the end of the plots 1 m from the bund one hobo pendant temp alarm pendant was also placed at each grid point spot fig 2 for bed plots the pendants were placed in the furrows in addition two pendants were placed on the bund of each plot to determine air temperature control temperature all pendants and the stopwatch for manual determination used for determining time when the water reached or receded from each monitoring spot were synchronized for time with the same computer the hobo pendant used in this study measures temperature and the observation interval was set to one minute min during the rice maize season the air temperature is high as the water touches the pendant its temperature decreases when the water drains away recedes from the pendant its temperature comes closer to air temperature the times of advance and recession were thus determined based on the temperature difference between the pendants in the irrigated plot and the pendants on the bund to reduce the influence of soil temperature on the pendants a thin and pendant sized piece of plywood was attached tightly with a rubber band to ensure that the determination of the advance and recession was based solely on the difference in the water and air temperatures in all plots inlet time the time water first entered the plot was recorded manually the water advance and recession times computed using the pendant were checked against visual observations using the bamboo grid marks and stopwatch the average of the three pendants across the plot was used to determine both advance and recession times at each of the four locations along the plot head middle tail end 2 4 3 2 wheat visual observations were used to determine advance and recession times during irrigation of the wheat crops as air temperature was lower than the water temperature in winter the water advance rate was computed for all irrigations of all crops in both years the time of recession was also determined for all irrigations of wheat and maize and for 7 irrigations of rice each year intake opportunity time was computed by subtracting the time for water advance from the time of recession at each of the four locations along each plot as plot length varied from 32 to 46 m the advance and recession data were normalized for a plot length of 40 m with the centres of the head middle tail and end at 6 7 20 33 3 and 39 m respectively this was done by calculating the advance and recession rates at the 4 locations in each plot in metres per minute metres from the top edge of the plot m min 1 the normalized advance and recession times at each location were then calculated by multiplying the rates by the distance of the location from the top of a 40 m long plot 2 4 4 irrigation amount the amount of irrigation applied to each plot was determined for all irrigations except the first three using a stingray 2 0 portable level velocity logger flow metre placed in the inlet pipe to each plot for the first three irrigations of the first crop the amount of irrigation water was computed from the duration of the irrigation and the flow rate of the tubewell assuming conveyance losses negligible as the pump was less than 10 m away each year the rice replicates received 13 18 irrigations it was not possible to complete the irrigation of all three replicates farmers fields on the one day therefore the number of irrigations of rice replicates varied as it sometimes rained after 1 or 2 replicates had been irrigated and remaining replicates did not need irrigation the 2014 maize crop was not irrigated as rainfall was adequate to maintain soil water tension above the threshold for irrigation throughout the season but the 2015 crop received 2 post sowing irrigations all wheat crops received 5 irrigations except for the 2015 16 crop in the rw system which received 4 irrigations table s2 irrigation water productivity wpi was computed as kg grain m 3 of water applied 2 4 5 volumetric soil water content volumetric soil water content vwc was determined near the centre of the head middle and tail sections of every lasered plot by a pr2 profile probe measurements were made at 10 20 30 40 60 and 100 cm soil depth in tubes installed mid way between the plant rows in the flat plots and in the centre of the beds with soil depth taken from the tops of the beds a total of 93 days of readings in rice 63 in 2014 and 30 in 2015 54 days in wheat 29 in 2014 15 and 25 in 2015 16 and 72 days in maize 59 in 2014 and 13 in 2015 were taken in both years in all crops readings were made 1 2 h before irrigation bi and 1 2 days after irrigation ai as soon as the plots could be accessed without damaging the soil crop and otherwise approximately twice weekly 2 5 economic analysis gross return total cost of production excluding land rent and gross margin for rice wheat and maize crops were determined for each treatment each year the costs of production considered were total labour hired plus family labour inputs seed fertilizer herbicide and machinery hire for tillage land levelling bed formation rice transplanting threshing winnowing the cost of laser land levelling for each gradient and for bed formation were based on the time taken for each plot and converted into h ha 1 and custom hire charges for these operations the cost of custom hire laser land levelling was used for 0 gradient and the cost for 0 1 gradient was calculated from this by multiplying by the proportionate change in time to achieve 0 1 gradient tables s5 and s6 the cost of laser land levelling was assigned to the first crop rice maize each year the cost for irrigation water was computed for each treatment from the duration hours of each irrigation in each plot and the current rental charge of 100 inr h 1 for the 6 5 hp motorized pump the labour requirement and costs of inputs and machinery hire for each crop were based on the findings of recall surveys of participating farmers key informant surveys of agricultural input supplier and machinery service providers government fixed prices for grain and straw were used as the price of outputs gross margin was computed from the difference between gross return and total cost of production costs were converted to usd using an exchange rate of 62 inr 1 usd it is likely that the determination of gross margin is conservative because farmers supply their own labour in addition to hiring labour 2 6 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova with a general linear model glm by segregating the sampling error from the experimental error was conducted using the agricolae package of r version 3 6 1 analysis of variance for a randomized complete block design was used to compare the effects of treatment three in rw five in mw year and section in the case of yield and their interactions on grain yield irrigation amount and wpi for each crop within each system for the mw system anova was also used to check for interactions between land gradient configuration and section each year none of the interactions were significant apart from a significant interaction between gradient and section on grain yield of wheat in the mw system in 2014 2015 therefore the year and treatment means for grain yield irrigation amount and wpi plus the section means for grain yield are presented tables 1 2 4 5 the effects of treatment on the water advance recession intake opportunity and vwc were determined using anova for each sampling repeated point and the differences between individual treatments were analyzed using fisher s protected least significant difference lsd 3 results 3 1 weather solar radiation was higher in 2015 16 than 2014 15 during most of the reproductive and grain filling period for rice and maize sep oct for wheat solar radiation in 2016 was higher than in 2015 during the vegetative nov dec and the reproductive and grain filling period feb mar fig 3a in the rice maize season june october average temperature was about 0 5 c higher in 2015 than in 2014 fig 3b for wheat nov april the average temperature was 2 1 c higher in 2015 16 than 2014 15 with the biggest difference 4 2 c in april towards the end of the grain filling period total rainfall was 1176 mm and 969 mm in 2014 15 and 2015 16 respectively with about 90 falling during the rice maize season each year fig 3c although total rainfall was higher in the first year the amount of rainfall received in july 2015 285 mm soon after establishment of rice and maize was 49 higher in 2015 than in july 2014 3 2 grain yield of rice maize and wheat as affected by gradient and configuration in the both the rw and mw systems there was a consistent trend for higher yield in the 0 flat treatments than in fl in all crops but the differences were never significant table 1 within land configuration flats or beds there was no significant effect of gradient on the yield of wheat both systems or maize but yield of rice with 0 1 gradient was significantly higher by 10 than yield with 0 gradient yield of maize and wheat on beds was higher than yield on the flat by 0 44 t ha 1 or 8 in maize and 0 32 t ha 1 or 7 in wheat for maize there was a general trend for yield to decline with distance from the top of the plots each year fig s2 but the differences were never significant table s3 there were no consistent trends for the effect of section on yield of wheat in either system however in 2014 15 there was a significant interaction between gradient and section on yield of wheat in the mw system table 2 with 0 gradient yield declined significantly between the head and tail sections whereas with 0 1 gradient yield in the tail section was significantly higher than in the head section there was a consistent trend for higher yields of all crops in the first year than the second year table 1 rice yield in 2014 was higher by 23 1 3 t ha 1 than in 2015 maize yield by 14 0 90 t ha 1 and wheat yield by 13 0 69 t ha 1 and 7 0 33 t ha 1 not significant in the mw and rw systems respectively 3 3 advance recession and intake opportunity time in rice wheat and maize wheat systems 3 3 1 water advance for the rw system the average time for the irrigation water to reach the end of the rice plots 40 m was 39 min for 0 1 49 min for 0 and 59 min for fl fig 4a the water advance time was thus decreased by 17 and 34 with 0 and 0 1 land gradient respectively compared to fl similarly in wheat the advance time was decreased by 17 and 30 in 0 and 0 1 gradients compared with fl fig 4b the faster advance in rice than wheat within respective treatments was probably due to both the higher flow rates used for rice and wetter soil lower irrigation threshold at the time of irrigation in the mw system the time for water to reach the end of the plots ranged from 85 to 105 min the advance was faster in bed than flat plots regardless of gradient and slowest in fl fig 4c d in both the maize and wheat crops on the beds there was no significant difference in advance time between 0 and 0 1 gradients throughout the length of the plots however on the flat the advance was faster with 0 1 than 0 gradient in the tail section and in either the middle section maize or at the end of the plots wheat as for the rw system the advance was slower in fl than any other treatment combination 3 3 2 water recession the recession time was longer in rice than the non rice crops and ranged from about 300 550 min across treatments and plot sections in rice fig 5 in both the rw and mw systems the recession time for wheat ranged from about 200 400 min while for maize it ranged from about 150 350 min there were few clear treatment trends in recession time in the 0 1 flat plots the water recession time tended to increase towards the end of the plots in the mw system recession times in wheat were shorter in the 0 1 beds than in the 0 beds however in maize recession times were longer in the 0 1 beds in the tail and end of the plots within the same gradient water recession times were generally shorter in flat plots than beds 3 3 3 intake opportunity time trends in intake opportunity time were generally similar to trends in recession time because recession times were much longer than advance times fig 6 mean section intake opportunity times ranged from 300 to 500 min in rice 100 300 min in maize 200 300 min in wheat in the rw system and 200 375 min in wheat in the mw system in rice mean intake opportunity time in 0 1 flat and fl was similar 400 min and significantly higher by 30 than in 0 flat table 3 in the rw system there was no effect of levelling treatment on mean intake opportunity time in wheat but in the mw system intake opportunity time in fl was significantly lower than in all other treatments in the mw system intake opportunity time was increased on the beds in comparison with flats there was a trend for 0 1 gradient on the flat to reduce intake opportunity time in comparison with 0 in both crops and in wheat on beds however the gradient did not affect intake opportunity time for maize on beds 3 4 irrigation amount and irrigation water productivity 3 4 1 irrigation amount land gradient and configuration significantly affected irrigation amount in all crops table 4 in the rw system 0 gradient on the flat reduced the amount in both rice and wheat by about 25 compared with fl although the magnitude of the reduction was much larger in rice 313 mm than wheat 71 mm changing to 0 1 gradient did not further reduce irrigation amount to either crop in the mw system there was no significant interaction between gradient and configuration table s4 the flat treatment with 0 gradient reduced irrigation amount in maize by 42 148 mm compared with fl and a 0 1 gradient further reduced irrigation amount by 23 mm while there was also a declining trend with laser levelling and increased gradient irrigation amount to wheat was similar in fl and 0 and 0 1 flat plots beds further decreased irrigation amount to maize with reductions of 54 and 58 with 0 and 0 1 gradient respectively compared with fl irrigation amount to wheat on beds was reduced by about 25 in comparison with fl and was not affected by gradient irrigation amount to rice and wheat was significantly lower in 2014 5 than in 2015 6 table 4 while maize did not require irrigation in the first year 3 4 2 irrigation water productivity irrigation water productivity was significantly lower in fl than in all gradient x configuration treatment combinations in all crops except for similar values on 0 flat in the mw system table 5 within land configuration there was a trend for higher wpi with 0 1 than 0 gradient but the difference was only significant for wheat on the flat in the rw system in the mw system there was no significant interaction between gradient and configuration table s4 wpi of maize was significantly higher by 34 on beds than flats and by 21 in wheat irrigation water productivity of both crops in the rw system was similar each year however in the mw system wpi of wheat was higher in 2015 than in 2014 3 5 soil water content in rice wheat and maize wheat systems volumetric soil water content varied during the crop growing period to a depth of about 30 cm during rice 100 cm during maize and 80 cm during wheat figs s3 and s4 average vwc content averaged over all measurements over both years was similar within depth in all treatments in the rw system within each crop fig 7a b in the mw system average vwc in the topsoil at 10 and 20 cm of fl was lower than in the other treatments fig 7c a 0 1 gradient in the beds had almost no effect on average vwc in wheat except for a lower value at 10 cm fig 7d in maize vwc of the topsoil 10 and 20 cm and at 60 cm was lower on beds than flats with the same gradient 3 6 economic analysis with farmer levelling fl the average over two years total cost of rice production was usd 1167 ha 1 more than double that of maize production and roughly double the cost of wheat production in each system table 6 the higher production cost of rice was mainly due to much higher irrigation cost which was 53 of the total rice production cost tables s5 s7 laser levelling slightly decreased the cost of production of rice over fl due to reduced irrigation cost more than offsetting the increased levelling cost laser levelling and beds increased the production cost of maize by usd 150 210 ha 1 and decreased the production cost of wheat slightly the returns from maize were higher than from all other crops within treatment similarly the returns from rice were higher than those from wheat more so in the rw system table 6 laser levelling with 0 gradient and flat configuration gave similar returns to fl in all crops except for wheat in the rw system which had higher returns in the lasered treatment laser levelling with 0 1 gradient and flat configuration significantly increased returns from all crops in comparison with fl beds with either gradient further increased returns of both maize and wheat relative to fl rice was by far the least profitable crop fl rice had a small negative gross margin while rice with laser levelling gave relatively small gross margins usd 121 223 ha 1 table 6 maize was the most profitable crop with gross margins ranging from usd 770 880 ha 1 wheat was also profitable with gross margins ranging from usd 560 640 ha 1 using fl gross margin of the annual mw system was 4 times that of the rw system table 6 in the lasered treatments with flat configuration gross margin of the mw system was 2 3 times that of the rw system a 0 gradient with flat configuration significantly increased gross margin of the rw system over fl but not the mw system a 0 1 gradient on the flat significantly increased the gross margin of both systems above systems with 0 gradient the use of beds in the mw system further increased gross margin over the flat treatments with no effect of slope 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of farmer practice levelling fl and laser levelling with 0 gradient and flat configuration the lower irrigation amounts and higher wpi of the 0 lasered flat treatments in comparison with fl are consistent with the findings of other studies in small farmers fields in south asia jat et al 2006 2015 aryal et al 2015 these studies also often show yield benefits when comparing 0 laser levelling on the flat with farmer practice the lack of a significant effect on yield of any crop in our study is probably because the same best management practices were used in both the lasered and fl treatments in our study the only differences between fl and the 0 laser levelled treatments in our study were the use of farmer levelling methods farmers practice in other studies often involves a range of typical sub optimal farmer management practices other than levelling rice grown with fl was not profitable slightly negative gross margin because of the high irrigation cost but laser levelling gave a small profit in contrast laser levelling with 0 gradient and flat configuration did not increase the profitability of maize because the reduction in irrigation cost was too small to offset the cost of laser levelling 4 2 effect of gradient 0 0 versus 0 1 4 2 1 irrigation advance and amount laser levelling with a 0 1 gradient increased the advance rate of the irrigation water along the flat plots in all crops in both cropping systems as hypothesized the time taken for the water to reach the end of the plots was decreased by 9 min or 12 in 0 1 flat treatments compared with 0 while there was also a trend for more rapid advance in the beds with 0 1 than 0 gradient the effect was very small the more rapid advance with 0 1 gradient resulted in a consistent trend for lower irrigation amount than with 0 gradient but the difference was never significant except for maize grown on flats and on beds plot size was probably too small for the effect of gradient on irrigation amount to be significant on the clay loam soil the potential for a small gradient to reduce irrigation amount increases with plot size and on more permeable soils gonzález et al 2011 on a highly permeable clay loam soil in the philippines a 0 1 gradient resulted in a 22 irrigation reduction for dry seeded rice in comparison with 0 gradient evangelista 2019 the latter study was conducted in 50 m x 32 m plots and used the same irrigation scheduling rules as our study in a simulation study using the winsrfr and pozal models to optimize basin irrigation design gonzález et al 2011 found a 20 reduction in irrigation amount for rice with a gradient of 0 04 in comparison with 0 gradient in 200 m x 50 m plots with a flow rate of 100 l s 1 in a similar study in brazil winkler et al 2018 compared 0 0 20 0 25 0 28 and 0 40 gradients on the flat for rice they recommended using 0 1 gradient to improve drainage and soil drying and thus ability to establish the next upland crop after rice harvest in addition to gradient the water advance rate depends on several other factors including the discharge rate of the irrigation pump surface roughness infiltration rate and plot geometry walker et al 2006 bautista et al 2009 a higher discharge rate increases the water advance rate and reduces irrigation time thus reducing deep drainage losses and irrigation amount smith et al 2005 similarly optimizing the cut off time for irrigation can increase irrigation water productivity smith and uddin 2020 further experimental and simulation studies are needed to optimize the system for farmers fields in the igp such studies should consider management factors which farmers can manipulate including gradient plot geometry flow rate cut off time and the use of beds variation in seasonal conditions especially rainfall also needs to be considered 4 2 2 grain yield laser levelling with a 0 1 gradient increased rice yield by 10 0 5 t ha 1 in comparison with 0 gradient this was an unexpected result which is difficult to explain and further studies are needed to validate this finding a similar study done on a highly permeable clay loam soil of philippines reported no effect of gradient 0 vs 0 1 on grain yield evangelista 2019 the average intake opportunity time in our study was about 30 longer with 0 1 gradient compared with 0 suggesting that the plots were waterlogged for longer after each irrigation which could have been beneficial to the rice crop but the increased intake opportunity time only occurred in the tail section of the plots fig 6 whereas yields in all three sections were similar there was a consistent trend for higher yields of maize and wheat with 0 1 gradient compared with 0 within both bed and flat configurations but the differences were never significant in wheat and maize on the flat and in wheat on beds intake opportunity time decreased with 0 1 gradient compared with 0 gradient suggesting the possibility of reduced irrigation induced waterlogging and leaching the higher wheat yield in the tail end of the 0 1 treatment in the mw system could have been due to higher water availability as a result of the longer intake opportunity time in this section fig 5d average soil volumetric water content of the top 30 cm during the crop growing period was significantly higher by 10 in the tail end 25 9 cm3 cm 3 than the head end 23 7 cm3 cm 3 in contrast with 0 gradient wheat yield was higher in the head section than the tail section this was also associated with higher intake opportunity time in the head section and higher average soil water content the higher wheat yields in the first year than the second year were probably due to the much later sowing table s2 leading to later flowering 10 20 feb 2015 20 feb 1 mar 2016 pushing grain filling inter warmer weather added to that temperatures were higher in the latter part of the second wheat season than the first season fig 3 the yield difference across years was much greater for wheat in the mw system than the rw system this is likely due to a synergy in the first year between the cooler grain filling period and more favourable soil conditions in the mw system while the soil was not puddled for rice it remained at or near saturation throughout the season prolonged periods of waterlogging can affect the availability of nutrients in subsequent upland crops especially phosphorus willett 1979 willett and higgins 1978 waterlogging can also lead to soil structural decline and adverse effects on upland crops bazzoffi and nieddu 2011 4 2 3 irrigation water productivity wpi there was a consistent trend for higher wpi with 0 1 than 0 gradient within the same configuration in all crops in both systems but the differences were not significant except for wheat in the rw system in the latter case wpi was increased by 23 or 0 42 kg m 3 in the mw system the effect of gradient on wpi was never significant due to the lack of significant or substantial effects on both irrigation amount and yield 4 2 4 overall benefits 0 1 versus 0 gradient for the rw system the results suggest no to marginal benefits in irrigation amount and wpi from laser levelling with a 0 1 gradient in comparison with 0 gradient in farmers irrigation plots of the size 15 m x 40 m typical of those found in the study region and indeed in much of bihar eastern india in the rw system by far the bigger biophysical gains were from changing from farmer levelling practice to laser levelling with 0 gradient on the flat those gains came in the form of substantial reductions in irrigation amount which led to greatly increased wpi in both crops by 40 while yield was not affected the saving in irrigation cost with laser levelling with 0 gradient more than offset the cost of levelling resulting in a small profit for rice and also increased the profitability of wheat and the rw system the yield increase with 0 1 gradient over 0 and fl further increased gross margin for both rice and the total rw system with 0 1 gradient this rice yield increase warrants further investigation given the large and increasing rw area currently being laser levelled with 0 gradient as for the rw system laser levelling to 0 with a flat configuration significantly increased wpi of both crops in the mw system in comparison with fl but by a lesser proportion 17 increase for both crops this was due to trends for higher yield and lower irrigation amount the latter small but significant in the case of maize while there were trends for higher yield and lower irrigation amount the latter significant in the case of maize in changing from 0 to 0 1 gradient this did not lead to a significant increase in wpi the gains in wpi were much bigger when changing from fl to beds regardless of gradient and slightly more so in beds with a 0 1 gradient in comparison with fl section 4 2 below whether laser levelling prior to bed formation confers additional benefits in comparison with farmer levelling prior to bed formation cannot be ascertained from this study laser levelling with a small gradient is common practice for irrigated crops grown on beds in large fields in developed countries to reduce irrigation time and deep drainage losses and facilitate surface drainage lasering with a 0 1 gradient and flat configuration did not increase gross margin of maize or wheat in comparison with 0 gradient but it did significantly increase gross margin of the mw system this demonstrates the importance of considering the total system rather than individual crops alone we repeated laser levelling each year to ensure that the desired gradients were maintained as our primary focus was on the effect of gradient on irrigation amount and however lasering each year is probably not needed especially when there is no puddling and even less so if zero till is used to established all crops in this case profitability of the laser levelled and bed treatments would be considerably higher for the maize and rice crops as the current analysis includes the cost of tillage prior to laser levelling in addition to the cost of levelling itself and bed formation 4 3 effect of raised beds on irrigation amount yield and wpi in the maize wheat system in laser levelled plots raised beds significantly increased yield of maize by 8 0 5 t ha 1 reduced irrigation amount by 20 40 mm and thus increased wpi by 34 1 0 kg m 3 in comparison with the laser levelled flat plots and the gains were even greater in comparison with fl the results are consistent with the findings of other studies in the region which compared raised beds with farmers practice choudhary et al 2018 jat et al 2019 while the same trends occurred in comparisons of wheat on laser levelled beds and flats the differences were not significant except for higher wpi of wheat on 0 1 beds compared with flats the yield increases in maize on beds occurred in 2014 when no irrigation was required as well as in 2015 2 post sowing irrigations there could be several reasons for the higher yield of maize but not wheat on beds bed formation involves shifting of topsoil from the furrows to the bed tops and the maize was planted in the middle of the beds thus the maize could have benefited from increased nutrient availability in the beds on the other hand the wheat was planted across the beds topsoil enriched and furrows topsoil depleted with no potential benefit to average yield across the plots and benefitted from the increased water availability in the tail section reduction in waterlogging is another potential benefit of beds walker et al 2006 bautista et al 2009 especially on clayey soils such as in vaishali the duration of irrigation induced waterlogging is influenced by intake opportunity time regression of intake opportunity time against maize yield in 2015 and wheat yield in 2014 15 showed no significant relationship between intake opportunity time and yield on either flats or beds data not presented suggesting no significant benefits of beds in terms of irrigation induced waterlogging in these crops years however in 2015 16 wheat there was a significant decline in yield with intake opportunity time on both flats and beds fig 8 the rate of decline was similar for both configurations 235 kg ha 1 h 1 but the intercept was about 0 5 t ha 1 higher on beds than flats the similar rate of decline suggests that irrigation induced waterlogging affected yield in that year but to the same degree on both flats and beds why that may have been the case in only one crop year system is unclear waterlogging affects physiological processes growth and yield of many annual crops and the yield reduction in annual crops ranges from 15 to 20 herzog et al 2016 yield of winter wheat and barley declined by 25 under poorly drained conditions in denmark jensen et al 2021 waterlogging can also have adverse effects on the yield of maize tian et al 2020 however our results do not suggest reduced irrigation induced waterlogging in the maize in 2015 other studies have also shown that bed planting of wheat and maize increased the water advance rate reduced irrigation amount and increased yield and wpi in comparison with farmers practice sayre and moreno ramos 1997 jat et al 2011 araya et al 2012 in the mw system beds resulted in significant increases in gross margin of maize and wheat over flats across gradients and in gross margin of the mw system regardless of gradient this further increased the total mw system gross margin to 116 120 of that of fl 4 4 field consolidation the small size of farmers plots is seen as one of the major constraints to the modernization of agriculture in india including the adoption of mechanization chand 2017 to address the challenge of small plot size land consolidation and collective action have been promoted to farming communities in recent times the small farmer large field sflf model has been recently introduced in eastern india to enable small farmers to benefit from economies of scale by integrating their small plots into one large field mohanty et al 2018 the model encourages consolidation of plots within the landholding of a farmer to facilitate the adoption of modern technologies the sflf concept gained immense popularity in vietnam mohanty et al 2017 ba et al 2019 with larger plots under the sflf model irrigations will take longer if supply flow rates are not increased proportionate to the increase in field size with potential negative effects on yield and wpi from increased waterlogging and longer irrigation time the study conducted by lybbert et al 2013 in eastern uttar pradesh a neighbouring state of bihar with similar agricultural landscape including plot size highlighted an interesting perspective on willingness to pay as the main driver for the adoption of laser land levelling rather than plot size the smallest plot size in their study was 800 m2 compared with 600 m2 in our study under the sflf model the introduction of a small e g 0 1 gradient may be more beneficial in bigger fields provided that irrigation supply rates increase proportionately and that drainage infrastructure allows adequate surface drainage from the field to prevent backup of water however the prevailing lack of drainage systems to take water away from farmers fields will likely diminish the benefits of slope in larger fields for upland crops unless this is also addressed 4 5 effect of cropping system on wheat yield wheat yield was 10 higher in the mw system than the rw system despite the fact that site history was similar for both systems puddled transplanted rice conventional till wheat this is consistent with the findings of several other studies comparing rw and mw systems where the soil was puddled prior to rice transplanting choudhary et al 2018 kumar et al 2018 however in our study the soil was not puddled prior to rice transplanting and both rw and mw fields had a long history of puddling for rice prior to commencement of the experiment the reasons for the higher wheat yield in the mw system cannot be elucidated from our study but could include the effects of the much wetter soil conditions in rice than maize in the rw system affecting nutrient availability in the succeeding wheat crop in particular phosphorus willett 1982 and soil structure bazzoffi et al 2011 5 conclusions this study showed that laser levelling with a small 0 1 gradient in farmers plots 15 m x 40 m produced a consistent trend for reduced irrigation amount in rice wheat and maize crops in comparison with 0 gradient however the effect was not significant except for a very small 14 mm but significant reduction in irrigation amount to maize on beds there was also a consistent trend for higher grain yield and wpi of all crops with 0 1 gradient but the increase was never significant except for grain yield of rice the latter is an unexpected result which needs to be validated explained the results suggest no to marginal biophysical benefits of laser levelling with a 0 1 gradient in the rw system in comparison with 0 by far the bigger irrigation and wpi benefits in the rw system came from changing from farmer levelling practice to laser levelling with 0 gradient as is currently practised this led to substantial reductions in irrigation amount by 25 in rice and 23 in wheat increases in wpi by 43 in rice and 41 in wheat and increases in gross margin of both crops and the total rw system gross margin of the rw system was greatest with lasering with a 0 1 slope because of higher rice and wheat yields in contrast to the rw system there were only small gains from lasering to zero gradient on the flat in the mw system by far the bigger gains were from changing to beds regardless of gradient in terms of increased grain yield by 8 in maize and 7 in wheat wpi by 34 in maize and 22 in wheat and gross margin by 17 20 and decreased irrigation amount by 20 in maize and 11 in wheat therefore the findings to date suggest that with current farmer plot size laser levelling with 0 1 gradient is probably the best option for rw fields while beds are the best option for mw fields whether laser levelling of the fields prior to bed formation is beneficial for the mw system cannot be ascertained from our study and needs to be investigated while there was a consistent trend for higher yields and wpi and lower irrigation amount with beds on a 0 1 gradient in comparison with 0 in both maize and wheat crops the effect of gradient was never significant if the current push for consolidation of farmers small plots into larger fields is realized the benefits of laser levelling with a small gradient instead of zero gradient will need to be reconsidered as larger plots will increase irrigation times however to fully realize the benefits supply flow rates will need to be increased proportionate to the increase in field size and appropriate drainage infrastructure will be

10000,laser land levelling is expanding rapidly in the rice wheat rw and maize wheat mw systems of the indo gangetic plains of india and pakistan current practice is to level to zero 0 gradient whereas a small gradient e g 0 1 is typically used in developed countries therefore experiments were conducted in farmers plots 15 m x 40 m in the eastern gangetic plains to evaluate laser levelling with a 0 1 gradient in comparison with 0 and farmer levelling practice fl the study was conducted over two years in rw and mw systems in the mw system raised beds in plots lasered with 0 and 0 1 gradients were also evaluated laser levelling with 0 gradient significantly reduced irrigation amount and or increased irrigation water productivity wpi in all crops systems grown on the flat compared to fl except for wheat in the mw system while there was a consistent trend for higher yield with a 0 gradient compared with fl the differences were not significant in any crop system for the rw system the results suggest no to marginal benefits in irrigation amount and wpi from levelling with a 0 1 gradient in comparison with 0 gradient in that system by far the bigger gains were from changing from fl to laser levelling with 0 gradient this resulted in substantial reductions in irrigation amount which greatly increased wpi in both crops by 40 while yield was not affected rice grown with fl was not profitable but lasering with 0 gradient significantly increased gross margin for rice wheat and the total rw system as for the rw system levelling to 0 with a flat configuration significantly increased wpi of both crops in the mw system compared to fl but by a lesser proportion raised beds significantly increased yield of maize by 8 0 5 t ha 1 reduced irrigation amount by 20 40 mm and increased wpi by 34 1 0 kg m 3 in comparison with the laser levelled flat plots gross margin of the mw system on beds was 17 20 higher than fl and gross margin with beds on a 0 1 gradient was significantly higher than either gradient on the flat the results suggest that the gains from levelling with a 0 1 gradient compared to 0 are marginal however this may change if the goal of consolidation of small farmer plots into larger fields becomes a reality provided there is a proportionate increase in irrigation flow rates and ability to drain keywords raised beds slope advance time intake opportunity time mechanical transplanting bihar 1 introduction sustainability of the annual growth in rice and wheat production is one of the prime concerns for india to feed its fast growing population given the limited prospects for substantial and sustainable increases in crop production in northwest india the home of the green revolution the country has policies and or programs for a second green revolution in eastern india pathak et al 2019 key attributes of eastern india are large yield gaps and large and untapped groundwater resources suggesting high potential to greatly increase crop productivity to help feed the nation mohanty et al 2017 laser assisted land levelling laser levelling is one technology helping to reduce the yield gap and its use is expanding rapidly in the indo gangetic plains igp of south asia with 1 5 mha laser levelled by 2015 jat et al 2015 in the igp irrigated rice wheat rw systems predominate while maize wheat mw systems are becoming increasingly important especially in the eastern igp the reasons for the popularity of laser levelling include i reduced irrigation amount mathankar et al 2005 abdullaev et al 2007 and improved uniformity of water application and consequently yield aryal et al 2015 jat et al 2015 ii increased cultivable land area through the reduction of bunds and channels naresh et al 2014 iii reduced weed density in rice rickman 2002 iv increased input use fertilizer pesticide etc efficiency jat et al 2011 and v more efficient machinery operations and improved crop establishment jat et al 2006 in the rw systems of pakistan adoption of laser land levelling has been shown to have positive impacts on wheat and rice yields and household income ali et al 2018 in the igp the fields are laser levelled to create a zero gradient both across and down from head to tail the field in contrast in developed countries a small gradient e g 0 08 0 2 in 100 700 m long fields in parts of australia is common for irrigated upland crops grown in both flat border check and bed layouts carroll et al 1995 khanna et al 2003 hamilton et al 2005 for rice upland systems in australia lasered contour layouts with a small gradient 0 4 0 5 across the plots perpendicular to the contours are often used to facilitate drainage a gradient from head to tail produces more rapid advance of the waterfront down the field reducing the duration of each irrigation drainage beyond the bottom of the root zone deep drainage and waterlogging an optimal gradient can reduce irrigation amount in upland crops by up to 20 walker et al 2006 bautista et al 2009 gonzález et al 2011 irrigation duration and drainage losses are also strongly influenced by inlet flow rate cut off time length and area of the field and soil type smith and uddin 2020 all these factors need to be considered in designing layouts and irrigation management that provide sufficient irrigation water intake opportunity time to wet the root zone across the field as uniformly as possible while minimizing deep drainage losses playan et al 1996 playán and mateos 2006 walker et al 2006 while the benefits of laser levelling with zero gradient in both directions have been well established in the small irrigation plots used by farmers in the igp jat et al 2015 whether levelling with a small gradient would confer further benefits in terms of yield and or irrigation water productivity wpi has not been considered in the study area of bihar state in eastern india field size is typically 1 acre 64 m 64 m for rice the field is divided into irrigation plots separated by earthen bunds of width typically ranging from 10 to 30 m and length from 20 to 60 m for wheat the rice plots are sub divided into shorter and narrower bunded plots aiming for more efficient irrigation in the eastern gangetic plains rice wheat and maize are the major food and fodder crops rice and maize are grown during the monsoon season june to september mostly on rainfall but with supplemental irrigation maize is also grown in the relatively dry rabi winter season in some pockets of the region unreliable amounts and distribution of rainfall adversely affect the timeliness of establishment of rice and thus the subsequent wheat crop grown in winter reducing the yield of both crops balwinder singh et al 2019 in addition periods of water deficit stress especially increased terminal drought stress resulting from delayed transplanting reduce yield in rice balwinder singh et al 2019 in this region rainfall has decreased during the period of rice establishment july and august and rainfall variability has increased over the past 30 years subash et al 2011 naidu et al 2017 puddling and transplanting of rice are delayed until the start of the monsoon rains due to the late arrival after the start of the monsoon of low cost canal water and the high cost of pumping groundwater farmers are faced with the choice of late transplanting with old seedlings and thus reduced yield or leaving the field fallow options for more timely establishment of crops and lower irrigation amount for crop establishment include mechanical transplanting of rice into non puddled soil np mtr yadav et al 2017 kar et al 2018 and switching to maize kumar et al 2018 it is also well established that the use of safe alternate wetting and drying water management for rice awd reduces irrigation amount while maintaining yield noting that a short period e g 10 15 days of ponding immediately after transplanting is recommended rejesus et al 2011 lampayan et al 2015 zero tillage zt and planting of both wheat and maize on raised beds have also been shown to reduce irrigation amount while maintaining or increasing yield in the eastern igp jat et al 2019 singh et al 2020 as in other parts of the igp ladha et al 2008 given the above a study was conducted to determine whether laser levelling with a small gradient would confer additional benefits in rw and mw systems implemented using the most promising technologies for the region i e zt for wheat in both systems np mtr grown with awd in the rw system and raised beds in the mw system the hypotheses were i laser levelling with a small 0 1 gradient will increase the rate of advance of the wetting front and reduce irrigation input to all crops compared with zero gradient ii laser levelling with 0 1 gradient will not affect rice yield iii laser levelling with 0 1 gradient will increase the yield of maize and wheat crops grown in flat configurations because of reduced waterlogging iv raised beds will increase the yield of maize and wheat and reduce irrigation input and v laser levelling with 0 1 gradient will not affect the yield of crops grown on beds thus the objectives of this study were to determine the effects of land gradient slope and configuration bed and flat on the intake opportunity time irrigation amount yield and irrigation water productivity wpi of rice wheat and maize crops grown in rw and mw cropping systems in eastern india 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites and soil on farm experiments were conducted from 2014 to 2016 in three neighbouring villages vaishali chak ramdas and bania in vaishali district of bihar state in india fig 1 the villages are located around 26 00 n latitude and 85 06 e longitude the experiments were conducted in collaboration with the local non government organization vaishali area small farmers association vasfa which was engaged in installing deep tubewells and promoting laser land levelling and improved crop establishment methods vaishali district is located within an extensive alluvial plain deposited by the ganga and the gandak rivers ash grey silt silt clay clayey silt soils predominate and can be broadly grouped into two categories entisols and inceptisols the texture of the soil in the experimental plots is clay loam with varying contents of sand and silt table s1 mean volumetric soil water content of the top soil 0 30 cm at field capacity 10 kpa is 32 cm3 cm 3 the climate of the region is sub tropical to sub humid with a rainy season from mid june to the end of september during which about 85 of annual rainfall is received tarafdar and agrawal 2013 all fields had a long history of growing puddled transplanted rice followed by conventional tillage wheat 2 2 experimental design and treatments two researcher led on farm experiments one each for the rw and mw systems were conducted for two years 2014 2016 commencing with rice or maize grown during the rainy season in 2014 each treatment was replicated three times an individual farmer s field serving as one replicate in the rw system three land gradient treatments 0 0 and 0 1 gradient created by laser levelling and farmers practice of levelling fl were compared fig 2 in the mw system four treatments with combinations of two laser levelled gradients 0 and 0 1 and two configurations raised beds flat were compared with fl the fields were re levelled prior to each rainy season crop to ensure that slope was retained 2 3 crop management 2 3 1 land preparation and crop establishment the fields to be laser levelled were dry ploughed three times using tyne cultivators before creating the land gradients all implements were drawn by a 55 hp 4 wheel tractor the gradient was verified using a laser land leveller receiver and transmitter after completion of land levelling plot size varied across replicates i e farmers fields 32 46 m long 14 16 m wide so the 0 1 gradient resulted in 3 2 4 6 cm difference in elevation between the head irrigation inlet and the tail ends of individual plots laser levelling was done each year prior to establishment of the rice or maize for the mw system raised beds 67 cm between the centres of adjacent beds width across the flat bed top 37 cm furrow width 30 cm furrow depth 15 cm were formed after laser levelling using a bed shaper preparation of fields for fl rice and maize typically involved two dry soil ploughings using a tyne cultivator with a trailing wooden plank drawn by a 55 hp 4 wheel tractor there was no puddling in any of the rice treatments and there was no tillage prior to sowing wheat in any treatment in both systems details of field layout crop establishment and management in the lasered treatments are provided in fig 2 and table s2 and briefly summarized here within each crop the method of establishment was the same across all treatments both laser levelled and fl in both the rw and mw systems row direction in all plots was from head to tail i e in the direction of the slope for rice the fields were irrigated and 15 day old seedlings were planted in the shallow flooded soil using a six row transplanter with 20 cm 20 cm spacing wheat was sown at 120 kg ha 1 using an 11 row seed cum fertilizer zero till drill with row spacing of 18 cm in both flat and bed plots the t openers sowing in the slopes of the beds were adjusted so that the seed was also buried the maize was dibbled manually following a pre sowing irrigation and a pre sowing application of glyphosate row spacing was 67 5 cm plant spacing 20 cm and in the bed plots the maize was planted in the middle of the bed tops a spade was used to create a slot in the moist soil into which the seed was dropped and the slot was closed by gently pressing with foot or spade 2 3 2 crop management for rice and maize hybrid varieties were used while a long duration inbred variety of wheat was used in both systems table s2 the same variety and recommended fertilizer rates and sowing transplanting weed and pest management were used in all treatments within each crop all the phosphorus p and potassium k fertilizer were applied at the time of transplanting rice or sowing maize and wheat except that the k fertilizer was broadcast with the 1st topdressing of nitrogen n fertilizer in wheat the p was applied as dap and the top dressed n was applied as urea in 3 splits in rice and two splits in wheat and maize weeds were well controlled through the use of herbicides and manual weeding in rice and maize in wheat one application of the herbicide sulfosulfuron metsulfuron methyl total controlled most of weed species including phalaris minor broadleaf weeds and other narrow leaf weeds and sedges including cyperus species the crops were irrigated by pumping groundwater from a supply canal at the head of the plots through a pipe diameter 75 mm in the centre of the bund the pumping rate was adjusted during each irrigation of individual plots to achieve a constant flow rate during and across irrigations the discharge rate of the pump was higher during irrigation of rice 12 6 4 0 l s 1 than wheat 7 1 1 8 l s 1 in the rw system in the mw system discharge rates were similar for maize 5 9 1 9 l s 1 and wheat 6 6 1 9 l s 1 irrigations were scheduled according to soil water tension one tensiometer was installed near the centre of the head mid and tail sections of each plot fig 2 at 15 cm soil depth in rice and at 32 5 cm in wheat and maize the tensiometers were read daily the crops were irrigated within 1 2 days after average soil water tension had increased to 10 35 and 50 kpa in rice wheat and maize respectively fig s1 irrigation was ceased cut off as soon the irrigation front the water flowing over the soil surface reached a peg at the mid point of the bottom edge of the plot the same criteria for irrigation scheduling and cut off were applied to all treatments within each crop each year there was no back up of drainage water in the ditch at the tail end of the experimental plots as the water was able to drain freely into the end of the adjacent farmers field at each site which was 10 50 cm lower in the landscape in typical farmers practice irrigation plot size for rice in this region ranges from 20 to 60 m length and 10 30 m width and the fields are puddled then levelled with wooden plank drawn by a tractor for wheat the rice plots are sub divided into 4 sections the plots are typically flood irrigated using groundwater delivered to individual plots using flexible pipe the groundwater is pumped using 6 5 hp diesel operated pumps giving discharge rates into plots of 4 17 l s 1 depending on the distance from the plot and hydraulic head generally farmers re irrigate rice depending on water availability and affordability when the soil surface begins to crack i e the cracks could be larger than hairline and add enough water to achieve a standing water depth of 5 15 cm three to five 3 5 irrigations are common for rice for wheat 2 4 irrigations are common applied at crown root initiation n fertilizer topdressing twice and flowering if four with plots flooded to a depth of 3 5 cm for rainy season maize 1 2 irrigations are generally applied at seedling and tassling silking the need for the later irrigation based on temporary wilting of the upper leaf with the soil flooded to 3 5 cm depth 2 4 measurements and observations 2 4 1 weather data daily rainfall and air temperature were extracted from era5 daily aggregates using the google earth engine gee rain gauges were installed in 3 locations but gaps in the data necessitated an alternative approach this approach provides data at 0 25 arc degrees equivalent to 25 km resolution at the latitude of vaishali daily climate reanalysis parameters on total precipitation and mean 2 m air temperature both at 0 25 arc degree of era5 which is the fifth generation atmospheric reanalysis of ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasts global climate were extracted using the gee in gee image collection for precipitation and temperature layers from era5 was defined a geographical location of the study area was assigned with date range filter and data were extracted as csv files daily solar radiation data of the same time range were downloaded from the nasa power national aeronautics and space administration prediction of worldwide energy resources website which provides data at 1 arc degree spatial resolution 2 4 2 grain yield grain yield was determined from areas harvested at six locations in each plot two within each of the head middle and tail sections rice and wheat were harvested from 4 m2 quadrats and maize from 9 m2 at each of the 6 locations for all crops grain yield was expressed in t ha 1 at 14 moisture content determined by oven drying the grain at 65 c for 72 h 2 4 3 water advance recession and intake opportunity time 2 4 3 1 rice and maize twelve bamboo sticks were installed to form a rectangular grid in each plot for monitoring the advance and recession of the irrigation water the plots were divided into three sections head middle tail of equal length and three sticks were placed at positions ¼ ½ and ¾ the way across the middle of each section an additional row of three sticks was placed near the end of the plots 1 m from the bund one hobo pendant temp alarm pendant was also placed at each grid point spot fig 2 for bed plots the pendants were placed in the furrows in addition two pendants were placed on the bund of each plot to determine air temperature control temperature all pendants and the stopwatch for manual determination used for determining time when the water reached or receded from each monitoring spot were synchronized for time with the same computer the hobo pendant used in this study measures temperature and the observation interval was set to one minute min during the rice maize season the air temperature is high as the water touches the pendant its temperature decreases when the water drains away recedes from the pendant its temperature comes closer to air temperature the times of advance and recession were thus determined based on the temperature difference between the pendants in the irrigated plot and the pendants on the bund to reduce the influence of soil temperature on the pendants a thin and pendant sized piece of plywood was attached tightly with a rubber band to ensure that the determination of the advance and recession was based solely on the difference in the water and air temperatures in all plots inlet time the time water first entered the plot was recorded manually the water advance and recession times computed using the pendant were checked against visual observations using the bamboo grid marks and stopwatch the average of the three pendants across the plot was used to determine both advance and recession times at each of the four locations along the plot head middle tail end 2 4 3 2 wheat visual observations were used to determine advance and recession times during irrigation of the wheat crops as air temperature was lower than the water temperature in winter the water advance rate was computed for all irrigations of all crops in both years the time of recession was also determined for all irrigations of wheat and maize and for 7 irrigations of rice each year intake opportunity time was computed by subtracting the time for water advance from the time of recession at each of the four locations along each plot as plot length varied from 32 to 46 m the advance and recession data were normalized for a plot length of 40 m with the centres of the head middle tail and end at 6 7 20 33 3 and 39 m respectively this was done by calculating the advance and recession rates at the 4 locations in each plot in metres per minute metres from the top edge of the plot m min 1 the normalized advance and recession times at each location were then calculated by multiplying the rates by the distance of the location from the top of a 40 m long plot 2 4 4 irrigation amount the amount of irrigation applied to each plot was determined for all irrigations except the first three using a stingray 2 0 portable level velocity logger flow metre placed in the inlet pipe to each plot for the first three irrigations of the first crop the amount of irrigation water was computed from the duration of the irrigation and the flow rate of the tubewell assuming conveyance losses negligible as the pump was less than 10 m away each year the rice replicates received 13 18 irrigations it was not possible to complete the irrigation of all three replicates farmers fields on the one day therefore the number of irrigations of rice replicates varied as it sometimes rained after 1 or 2 replicates had been irrigated and remaining replicates did not need irrigation the 2014 maize crop was not irrigated as rainfall was adequate to maintain soil water tension above the threshold for irrigation throughout the season but the 2015 crop received 2 post sowing irrigations all wheat crops received 5 irrigations except for the 2015 16 crop in the rw system which received 4 irrigations table s2 irrigation water productivity wpi was computed as kg grain m 3 of water applied 2 4 5 volumetric soil water content volumetric soil water content vwc was determined near the centre of the head middle and tail sections of every lasered plot by a pr2 profile probe measurements were made at 10 20 30 40 60 and 100 cm soil depth in tubes installed mid way between the plant rows in the flat plots and in the centre of the beds with soil depth taken from the tops of the beds a total of 93 days of readings in rice 63 in 2014 and 30 in 2015 54 days in wheat 29 in 2014 15 and 25 in 2015 16 and 72 days in maize 59 in 2014 and 13 in 2015 were taken in both years in all crops readings were made 1 2 h before irrigation bi and 1 2 days after irrigation ai as soon as the plots could be accessed without damaging the soil crop and otherwise approximately twice weekly 2 5 economic analysis gross return total cost of production excluding land rent and gross margin for rice wheat and maize crops were determined for each treatment each year the costs of production considered were total labour hired plus family labour inputs seed fertilizer herbicide and machinery hire for tillage land levelling bed formation rice transplanting threshing winnowing the cost of laser land levelling for each gradient and for bed formation were based on the time taken for each plot and converted into h ha 1 and custom hire charges for these operations the cost of custom hire laser land levelling was used for 0 gradient and the cost for 0 1 gradient was calculated from this by multiplying by the proportionate change in time to achieve 0 1 gradient tables s5 and s6 the cost of laser land levelling was assigned to the first crop rice maize each year the cost for irrigation water was computed for each treatment from the duration hours of each irrigation in each plot and the current rental charge of 100 inr h 1 for the 6 5 hp motorized pump the labour requirement and costs of inputs and machinery hire for each crop were based on the findings of recall surveys of participating farmers key informant surveys of agricultural input supplier and machinery service providers government fixed prices for grain and straw were used as the price of outputs gross margin was computed from the difference between gross return and total cost of production costs were converted to usd using an exchange rate of 62 inr 1 usd it is likely that the determination of gross margin is conservative because farmers supply their own labour in addition to hiring labour 2 6 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova with a general linear model glm by segregating the sampling error from the experimental error was conducted using the agricolae package of r version 3 6 1 analysis of variance for a randomized complete block design was used to compare the effects of treatment three in rw five in mw year and section in the case of yield and their interactions on grain yield irrigation amount and wpi for each crop within each system for the mw system anova was also used to check for interactions between land gradient configuration and section each year none of the interactions were significant apart from a significant interaction between gradient and section on grain yield of wheat in the mw system in 2014 2015 therefore the year and treatment means for grain yield irrigation amount and wpi plus the section means for grain yield are presented tables 1 2 4 5 the effects of treatment on the water advance recession intake opportunity and vwc were determined using anova for each sampling repeated point and the differences between individual treatments were analyzed using fisher s protected least significant difference lsd 3 results 3 1 weather solar radiation was higher in 2015 16 than 2014 15 during most of the reproductive and grain filling period for rice and maize sep oct for wheat solar radiation in 2016 was higher than in 2015 during the vegetative nov dec and the reproductive and grain filling period feb mar fig 3a in the rice maize season june october average temperature was about 0 5 c higher in 2015 than in 2014 fig 3b for wheat nov april the average temperature was 2 1 c higher in 2015 16 than 2014 15 with the biggest difference 4 2 c in april towards the end of the grain filling period total rainfall was 1176 mm and 969 mm in 2014 15 and 2015 16 respectively with about 90 falling during the rice maize season each year fig 3c although total rainfall was higher in the first year the amount of rainfall received in july 2015 285 mm soon after establishment of rice and maize was 49 higher in 2015 than in july 2014 3 2 grain yield of rice maize and wheat as affected by gradient and configuration in the both the rw and mw systems there was a consistent trend for higher yield in the 0 flat treatments than in fl in all crops but the differences were never significant table 1 within land configuration flats or beds there was no significant effect of gradient on the yield of wheat both systems or maize but yield of rice with 0 1 gradient was significantly higher by 10 than yield with 0 gradient yield of maize and wheat on beds was higher than yield on the flat by 0 44 t ha 1 or 8 in maize and 0 32 t ha 1 or 7 in wheat for maize there was a general trend for yield to decline with distance from the top of the plots each year fig s2 but the differences were never significant table s3 there were no consistent trends for the effect of section on yield of wheat in either system however in 2014 15 there was a significant interaction between gradient and section on yield of wheat in the mw system table 2 with 0 gradient yield declined significantly between the head and tail sections whereas with 0 1 gradient yield in the tail section was significantly higher than in the head section there was a consistent trend for higher yields of all crops in the first year than the second year table 1 rice yield in 2014 was higher by 23 1 3 t ha 1 than in 2015 maize yield by 14 0 90 t ha 1 and wheat yield by 13 0 69 t ha 1 and 7 0 33 t ha 1 not significant in the mw and rw systems respectively 3 3 advance recession and intake opportunity time in rice wheat and maize wheat systems 3 3 1 water advance for the rw system the average time for the irrigation water to reach the end of the rice plots 40 m was 39 min for 0 1 49 min for 0 and 59 min for fl fig 4a the water advance time was thus decreased by 17 and 34 with 0 and 0 1 land gradient respectively compared to fl similarly in wheat the advance time was decreased by 17 and 30 in 0 and 0 1 gradients compared with fl fig 4b the faster advance in rice than wheat within respective treatments was probably due to both the higher flow rates used for rice and wetter soil lower irrigation threshold at the time of irrigation in the mw system the time for water to reach the end of the plots ranged from 85 to 105 min the advance was faster in bed than flat plots regardless of gradient and slowest in fl fig 4c d in both the maize and wheat crops on the beds there was no significant difference in advance time between 0 and 0 1 gradients throughout the length of the plots however on the flat the advance was faster with 0 1 than 0 gradient in the tail section and in either the middle section maize or at the end of the plots wheat as for the rw system the advance was slower in fl than any other treatment combination 3 3 2 water recession the recession time was longer in rice than the non rice crops and ranged from about 300 550 min across treatments and plot sections in rice fig 5 in both the rw and mw systems the recession time for wheat ranged from about 200 400 min while for maize it ranged from about 150 350 min there were few clear treatment trends in recession time in the 0 1 flat plots the water recession time tended to increase towards the end of the plots in the mw system recession times in wheat were shorter in the 0 1 beds than in the 0 beds however in maize recession times were longer in the 0 1 beds in the tail and end of the plots within the same gradient water recession times were generally shorter in flat plots than beds 3 3 3 intake opportunity time trends in intake opportunity time were generally similar to trends in recession time because recession times were much longer than advance times fig 6 mean section intake opportunity times ranged from 300 to 500 min in rice 100 300 min in maize 200 300 min in wheat in the rw system and 200 375 min in wheat in the mw system in rice mean intake opportunity time in 0 1 flat and fl was similar 400 min and significantly higher by 30 than in 0 flat table 3 in the rw system there was no effect of levelling treatment on mean intake opportunity time in wheat but in the mw system intake opportunity time in fl was significantly lower than in all other treatments in the mw system intake opportunity time was increased on the beds in comparison with flats there was a trend for 0 1 gradient on the flat to reduce intake opportunity time in comparison with 0 in both crops and in wheat on beds however the gradient did not affect intake opportunity time for maize on beds 3 4 irrigation amount and irrigation water productivity 3 4 1 irrigation amount land gradient and configuration significantly affected irrigation amount in all crops table 4 in the rw system 0 gradient on the flat reduced the amount in both rice and wheat by about 25 compared with fl although the magnitude of the reduction was much larger in rice 313 mm than wheat 71 mm changing to 0 1 gradient did not further reduce irrigation amount to either crop in the mw system there was no significant interaction between gradient and configuration table s4 the flat treatment with 0 gradient reduced irrigation amount in maize by 42 148 mm compared with fl and a 0 1 gradient further reduced irrigation amount by 23 mm while there was also a declining trend with laser levelling and increased gradient irrigation amount to wheat was similar in fl and 0 and 0 1 flat plots beds further decreased irrigation amount to maize with reductions of 54 and 58 with 0 and 0 1 gradient respectively compared with fl irrigation amount to wheat on beds was reduced by about 25 in comparison with fl and was not affected by gradient irrigation amount to rice and wheat was significantly lower in 2014 5 than in 2015 6 table 4 while maize did not require irrigation in the first year 3 4 2 irrigation water productivity irrigation water productivity was significantly lower in fl than in all gradient x configuration treatment combinations in all crops except for similar values on 0 flat in the mw system table 5 within land configuration there was a trend for higher wpi with 0 1 than 0 gradient but the difference was only significant for wheat on the flat in the rw system in the mw system there was no significant interaction between gradient and configuration table s4 wpi of maize was significantly higher by 34 on beds than flats and by 21 in wheat irrigation water productivity of both crops in the rw system was similar each year however in the mw system wpi of wheat was higher in 2015 than in 2014 3 5 soil water content in rice wheat and maize wheat systems volumetric soil water content varied during the crop growing period to a depth of about 30 cm during rice 100 cm during maize and 80 cm during wheat figs s3 and s4 average vwc content averaged over all measurements over both years was similar within depth in all treatments in the rw system within each crop fig 7a b in the mw system average vwc in the topsoil at 10 and 20 cm of fl was lower than in the other treatments fig 7c a 0 1 gradient in the beds had almost no effect on average vwc in wheat except for a lower value at 10 cm fig 7d in maize vwc of the topsoil 10 and 20 cm and at 60 cm was lower on beds than flats with the same gradient 3 6 economic analysis with farmer levelling fl the average over two years total cost of rice production was usd 1167 ha 1 more than double that of maize production and roughly double the cost of wheat production in each system table 6 the higher production cost of rice was mainly due to much higher irrigation cost which was 53 of the total rice production cost tables s5 s7 laser levelling slightly decreased the cost of production of rice over fl due to reduced irrigation cost more than offsetting the increased levelling cost laser levelling and beds increased the production cost of maize by usd 150 210 ha 1 and decreased the production cost of wheat slightly the returns from maize were higher than from all other crops within treatment similarly the returns from rice were higher than those from wheat more so in the rw system table 6 laser levelling with 0 gradient and flat configuration gave similar returns to fl in all crops except for wheat in the rw system which had higher returns in the lasered treatment laser levelling with 0 1 gradient and flat configuration significantly increased returns from all crops in comparison with fl beds with either gradient further increased returns of both maize and wheat relative to fl rice was by far the least profitable crop fl rice had a small negative gross margin while rice with laser levelling gave relatively small gross margins usd 121 223 ha 1 table 6 maize was the most profitable crop with gross margins ranging from usd 770 880 ha 1 wheat was also profitable with gross margins ranging from usd 560 640 ha 1 using fl gross margin of the annual mw system was 4 times that of the rw system table 6 in the lasered treatments with flat configuration gross margin of the mw system was 2 3 times that of the rw system a 0 gradient with flat configuration significantly increased gross margin of the rw system over fl but not the mw system a 0 1 gradient on the flat significantly increased the gross margin of both systems above systems with 0 gradient the use of beds in the mw system further increased gross margin over the flat treatments with no effect of slope 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of farmer practice levelling fl and laser levelling with 0 gradient and flat configuration the lower irrigation amounts and higher wpi of the 0 lasered flat treatments in comparison with fl are consistent with the findings of other studies in small farmers fields in south asia jat et al 2006 2015 aryal et al 2015 these studies also often show yield benefits when comparing 0 laser levelling on the flat with farmer practice the lack of a significant effect on yield of any crop in our study is probably because the same best management practices were used in both the lasered and fl treatments in our study the only differences between fl and the 0 laser levelled treatments in our study were the use of farmer levelling methods farmers practice in other studies often involves a range of typical sub optimal farmer management practices other than levelling rice grown with fl was not profitable slightly negative gross margin because of the high irrigation cost but laser levelling gave a small profit in contrast laser levelling with 0 gradient and flat configuration did not increase the profitability of maize because the reduction in irrigation cost was too small to offset the cost of laser levelling 4 2 effect of gradient 0 0 versus 0 1 4 2 1 irrigation advance and amount laser levelling with a 0 1 gradient increased the advance rate of the irrigation water along the flat plots in all crops in both cropping systems as hypothesized the time taken for the water to reach the end of the plots was decreased by 9 min or 12 in 0 1 flat treatments compared with 0 while there was also a trend for more rapid advance in the beds with 0 1 than 0 gradient the effect was very small the more rapid advance with 0 1 gradient resulted in a consistent trend for lower irrigation amount than with 0 gradient but the difference was never significant except for maize grown on flats and on beds plot size was probably too small for the effect of gradient on irrigation amount to be significant on the clay loam soil the potential for a small gradient to reduce irrigation amount increases with plot size and on more permeable soils gonzález et al 2011 on a highly permeable clay loam soil in the philippines a 0 1 gradient resulted in a 22 irrigation reduction for dry seeded rice in comparison with 0 gradient evangelista 2019 the latter study was conducted in 50 m x 32 m plots and used the same irrigation scheduling rules as our study in a simulation study using the winsrfr and pozal models to optimize basin irrigation design gonzález et al 2011 found a 20 reduction in irrigation amount for rice with a gradient of 0 04 in comparison with 0 gradient in 200 m x 50 m plots with a flow rate of 100 l s 1 in a similar study in brazil winkler et al 2018 compared 0 0 20 0 25 0 28 and 0 40 gradients on the flat for rice they recommended using 0 1 gradient to improve drainage and soil drying and thus ability to establish the next upland crop after rice harvest in addition to gradient the water advance rate depends on several other factors including the discharge rate of the irrigation pump surface roughness infiltration rate and plot geometry walker et al 2006 bautista et al 2009 a higher discharge rate increases the water advance rate and reduces irrigation time thus reducing deep drainage losses and irrigation amount smith et al 2005 similarly optimizing the cut off time for irrigation can increase irrigation water productivity smith and uddin 2020 further experimental and simulation studies are needed to optimize the system for farmers fields in the igp such studies should consider management factors which farmers can manipulate including gradient plot geometry flow rate cut off time and the use of beds variation in seasonal conditions especially rainfall also needs to be considered 4 2 2 grain yield laser levelling with a 0 1 gradient increased rice yield by 10 0 5 t ha 1 in comparison with 0 gradient this was an unexpected result which is difficult to explain and further studies are needed to validate this finding a similar study done on a highly permeable clay loam soil of philippines reported no effect of gradient 0 vs 0 1 on grain yield evangelista 2019 the average intake opportunity time in our study was about 30 longer with 0 1 gradient compared with 0 suggesting that the plots were waterlogged for longer after each irrigation which could have been beneficial to the rice crop but the increased intake opportunity time only occurred in the tail section of the plots fig 6 whereas yields in all three sections were similar there was a consistent trend for higher yields of maize and wheat with 0 1 gradient compared with 0 within both bed and flat configurations but the differences were never significant in wheat and maize on the flat and in wheat on beds intake opportunity time decreased with 0 1 gradient compared with 0 gradient suggesting the possibility of reduced irrigation induced waterlogging and leaching the higher wheat yield in the tail end of the 0 1 treatment in the mw system could have been due to higher water availability as a result of the longer intake opportunity time in this section fig 5d average soil volumetric water content of the top 30 cm during the crop growing period was significantly higher by 10 in the tail end 25 9 cm3 cm 3 than the head end 23 7 cm3 cm 3 in contrast with 0 gradient wheat yield was higher in the head section than the tail section this was also associated with higher intake opportunity time in the head section and higher average soil water content the higher wheat yields in the first year than the second year were probably due to the much later sowing table s2 leading to later flowering 10 20 feb 2015 20 feb 1 mar 2016 pushing grain filling inter warmer weather added to that temperatures were higher in the latter part of the second wheat season than the first season fig 3 the yield difference across years was much greater for wheat in the mw system than the rw system this is likely due to a synergy in the first year between the cooler grain filling period and more favourable soil conditions in the mw system while the soil was not puddled for rice it remained at or near saturation throughout the season prolonged periods of waterlogging can affect the availability of nutrients in subsequent upland crops especially phosphorus willett 1979 willett and higgins 1978 waterlogging can also lead to soil structural decline and adverse effects on upland crops bazzoffi and nieddu 2011 4 2 3 irrigation water productivity wpi there was a consistent trend for higher wpi with 0 1 than 0 gradient within the same configuration in all crops in both systems but the differences were not significant except for wheat in the rw system in the latter case wpi was increased by 23 or 0 42 kg m 3 in the mw system the effect of gradient on wpi was never significant due to the lack of significant or substantial effects on both irrigation amount and yield 4 2 4 overall benefits 0 1 versus 0 gradient for the rw system the results suggest no to marginal benefits in irrigation amount and wpi from laser levelling with a 0 1 gradient in comparison with 0 gradient in farmers irrigation plots of the size 15 m x 40 m typical of those found in the study region and indeed in much of bihar eastern india in the rw system by far the bigger biophysical gains were from changing from farmer levelling practice to laser levelling with 0 gradient on the flat those gains came in the form of substantial reductions in irrigation amount which led to greatly increased wpi in both crops by 40 while yield was not affected the saving in irrigation cost with laser levelling with 0 gradient more than offset the cost of levelling resulting in a small profit for rice and also increased the profitability of wheat and the rw system the yield increase with 0 1 gradient over 0 and fl further increased gross margin for both rice and the total rw system with 0 1 gradient this rice yield increase warrants further investigation given the large and increasing rw area currently being laser levelled with 0 gradient as for the rw system laser levelling to 0 with a flat configuration significantly increased wpi of both crops in the mw system in comparison with fl but by a lesser proportion 17 increase for both crops this was due to trends for higher yield and lower irrigation amount the latter small but significant in the case of maize while there were trends for higher yield and lower irrigation amount the latter significant in the case of maize in changing from 0 to 0 1 gradient this did not lead to a significant increase in wpi the gains in wpi were much bigger when changing from fl to beds regardless of gradient and slightly more so in beds with a 0 1 gradient in comparison with fl section 4 2 below whether laser levelling prior to bed formation confers additional benefits in comparison with farmer levelling prior to bed formation cannot be ascertained from this study laser levelling with a small gradient is common practice for irrigated crops grown on beds in large fields in developed countries to reduce irrigation time and deep drainage losses and facilitate surface drainage lasering with a 0 1 gradient and flat configuration did not increase gross margin of maize or wheat in comparison with 0 gradient but it did significantly increase gross margin of the mw system this demonstrates the importance of considering the total system rather than individual crops alone we repeated laser levelling each year to ensure that the desired gradients were maintained as our primary focus was on the effect of gradient on irrigation amount and however lasering each year is probably not needed especially when there is no puddling and even less so if zero till is used to established all crops in this case profitability of the laser levelled and bed treatments would be considerably higher for the maize and rice crops as the current analysis includes the cost of tillage prior to laser levelling in addition to the cost of levelling itself and bed formation 4 3 effect of raised beds on irrigation amount yield and wpi in the maize wheat system in laser levelled plots raised beds significantly increased yield of maize by 8 0 5 t ha 1 reduced irrigation amount by 20 40 mm and thus increased wpi by 34 1 0 kg m 3 in comparison with the laser levelled flat plots and the gains were even greater in comparison with fl the results are consistent with the findings of other studies in the region which compared raised beds with farmers practice choudhary et al 2018 jat et al 2019 while the same trends occurred in comparisons of wheat on laser levelled beds and flats the differences were not significant except for higher wpi of wheat on 0 1 beds compared with flats the yield increases in maize on beds occurred in 2014 when no irrigation was required as well as in 2015 2 post sowing irrigations there could be several reasons for the higher yield of maize but not wheat on beds bed formation involves shifting of topsoil from the furrows to the bed tops and the maize was planted in the middle of the beds thus the maize could have benefited from increased nutrient availability in the beds on the other hand the wheat was planted across the beds topsoil enriched and furrows topsoil depleted with no potential benefit to average yield across the plots and benefitted from the increased water availability in the tail section reduction in waterlogging is another potential benefit of beds walker et al 2006 bautista et al 2009 especially on clayey soils such as in vaishali the duration of irrigation induced waterlogging is influenced by intake opportunity time regression of intake opportunity time against maize yield in 2015 and wheat yield in 2014 15 showed no significant relationship between intake opportunity time and yield on either flats or beds data not presented suggesting no significant benefits of beds in terms of irrigation induced waterlogging in these crops years however in 2015 16 wheat there was a significant decline in yield with intake opportunity time on both flats and beds fig 8 the rate of decline was similar for both configurations 235 kg ha 1 h 1 but the intercept was about 0 5 t ha 1 higher on beds than flats the similar rate of decline suggests that irrigation induced waterlogging affected yield in that year but to the same degree on both flats and beds why that may have been the case in only one crop year system is unclear waterlogging affects physiological processes growth and yield of many annual crops and the yield reduction in annual crops ranges from 15 to 20 herzog et al 2016 yield of winter wheat and barley declined by 25 under poorly drained conditions in denmark jensen et al 2021 waterlogging can also have adverse effects on the yield of maize tian et al 2020 however our results do not suggest reduced irrigation induced waterlogging in the maize in 2015 other studies have also shown that bed planting of wheat and maize increased the water advance rate reduced irrigation amount and increased yield and wpi in comparison with farmers practice sayre and moreno ramos 1997 jat et al 2011 araya et al 2012 in the mw system beds resulted in significant increases in gross margin of maize and wheat over flats across gradients and in gross margin of the mw system regardless of gradient this further increased the total mw system gross margin to 116 120 of that of fl 4 4 field consolidation the small size of farmers plots is seen as one of the major constraints to the modernization of agriculture in india including the adoption of mechanization chand 2017 to address the challenge of small plot size land consolidation and collective action have been promoted to farming communities in recent times the small farmer large field sflf model has been recently introduced in eastern india to enable small farmers to benefit from economies of scale by integrating their small plots into one large field mohanty et al 2018 the model encourages consolidation of plots within the landholding of a farmer to facilitate the adoption of modern technologies the sflf concept gained immense popularity in vietnam mohanty et al 2017 ba et al 2019 with larger plots under the sflf model irrigations will take longer if supply flow rates are not increased proportionate to the increase in field size with potential negative effects on yield and wpi from increased waterlogging and longer irrigation time the study conducted by lybbert et al 2013 in eastern uttar pradesh a neighbouring state of bihar with similar agricultural landscape including plot size highlighted an interesting perspective on willingness to pay as the main driver for the adoption of laser land levelling rather than plot size the smallest plot size in their study was 800 m2 compared with 600 m2 in our study under the sflf model the introduction of a small e g 0 1 gradient may be more beneficial in bigger fields provided that irrigation supply rates increase proportionately and that drainage infrastructure allows adequate surface drainage from the field to prevent backup of water however the prevailing lack of drainage systems to take water away from farmers fields will likely diminish the benefits of slope in larger fields for upland crops unless this is also addressed 4 5 effect of cropping system on wheat yield wheat yield was 10 higher in the mw system than the rw system despite the fact that site history was similar for both systems puddled transplanted rice conventional till wheat this is consistent with the findings of several other studies comparing rw and mw systems where the soil was puddled prior to rice transplanting choudhary et al 2018 kumar et al 2018 however in our study the soil was not puddled prior to rice transplanting and both rw and mw fields had a long history of puddling for rice prior to commencement of the experiment the reasons for the higher wheat yield in the mw system cannot be elucidated from our study but could include the effects of the much wetter soil conditions in rice than maize in the rw system affecting nutrient availability in the succeeding wheat crop in particular phosphorus willett 1982 and soil structure bazzoffi et al 2011 5 conclusions this study showed that laser levelling with a small 0 1 gradient in farmers plots 15 m x 40 m produced a consistent trend for reduced irrigation amount in rice wheat and maize crops in comparison with 0 gradient however the effect was not significant except for a very small 14 mm but significant reduction in irrigation amount to maize on beds there was also a consistent trend for higher grain yield and wpi of all crops with 0 1 gradient but the increase was never significant except for grain yield of rice the latter is an unexpected result which needs to be validated explained the results suggest no to marginal biophysical benefits of laser levelling with a 0 1 gradient in the rw system in comparison with 0 by far the bigger irrigation and wpi benefits in the rw system came from changing from farmer levelling practice to laser levelling with 0 gradient as is currently practised this led to substantial reductions in irrigation amount by 25 in rice and 23 in wheat increases in wpi by 43 in rice and 41 in wheat and increases in gross margin of both crops and the total rw system gross margin of the rw system was greatest with lasering with a 0 1 slope because of higher rice and wheat yields in contrast to the rw system there were only small gains from lasering to zero gradient on the flat in the mw system by far the bigger gains were from changing to beds regardless of gradient in terms of increased grain yield by 8 in maize and 7 in wheat wpi by 34 in maize and 22 in wheat and gross margin by 17 20 and decreased irrigation amount by 20 in maize and 11 in wheat therefore the findings to date suggest that with current farmer plot size laser levelling with 0 1 gradient is probably the best option for rw fields while beds are the best option for mw fields whether laser levelling of the fields prior to bed formation is beneficial for the mw system cannot be ascertained from our study and needs to be investigated while there was a consistent trend for higher yields and wpi and lower irrigation amount with beds on a 0 1 gradient in comparison with 0 in both maize and wheat crops the effect of gradient was never significant if the current push for consolidation of farmers small plots into larger fields is realized the benefits of laser levelling with a small gradient instead of zero gradient will need to be reconsidered as larger plots will increase irrigation times however to fully realize the benefits supply flow rates will need to be increased proportionate to the increase in field size and appropriate drainage infrastructure will be

10001,research is ongoing to increase our understanding on the mechanisms responsible for the variation in energy fluxes in greenhouses in this study a four year experiment 2016 2017 2019 and 2020 was carried out to investigate the energy budget for drip irrigated tomato plants in a greenhouse where the latent heat flux λet was measured by two weighing lysimeters factors that determine energy budget and λet were also investigated the results indicated that λet was the principal component of net radiation r n accounting for 66 4 71 7 followed by sensible heat flux h and ground soil heat flux g the low values 0 25 0 32 of the seasonal mean midday bowen ratio β h λet also indicated that seasonal λet was greater than h for well watered tomato plants leaf area index lai strongly influenced the energy budget the ratio λet r n increased linearly as lai increased whereas h r n decreased linearly and g r n and β decreased logarithmically seasonal mean λet was 76 8 4 7 w m 2 which was less than the reported values for field crops this difference was attributed to the semi closed microclimate in the greenhouse the high values of the priestley taylor coefficient α 1 03 0 05 and the decoupling factor 0 69 0 05 showed that λet was principally determined by r n these values support the conclusion that λet was energy limited rather than water limited in the greenhouse canopy conductance g c also influenced λet as indicated by the high correlation between α and g c especially during the middle growth stage these findings are of great importance in creating an energy driven model and will lead to improved water management in greenhouse agriculture keywords aerodynamic conductance canopy conductance convection conditions decoupling factor priestley taylor coefficient 1 introduction greenhouse agriculture occupies a land area of 405 000 ha worldwide katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 solar greenhouses fig 1 supply a major proportion of vegetable crops in china they provide optimal crop production environments and maximize grower profits water and energy transfer between soil surface and the greenhouse atmosphere governs the physiological behavior of crops drives water circulation and energy storage and transforms vegetation and soil baldocchi 2001 gu et al 2005 energy from net radiation r n that is converted into sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux λet is significantly affected by irrigation vegetation growth and the greenhouse microclimate gong et al 2017a b jiao et al 2018 liu et al 2019 a good understanding of the behavior of energy components is important for improving water management and optimizing irrigation scheduling baldocchi 1994 chen et al 2019 ding et al 2013 youssef and giuseppe 2005 there have been many studies of water and heat energy transfer within open field ecosystems ai and yang 2016 gong et al 2017a b liu et al 2019 tian et al 2017 wang et al 2020 yan et al 2017 yu et al 2017 in which energy flux and crop evapotranspiration et vary under different climate conditions and soils the microclimate of a solar greenhouse differs considerably from that of an open field the greenhouse receives less energy due to the polyethylene sheeting covering the structure internal wind speed is low due to the greenhouse being partially closed to external meteorological activity and internal temperature and relative humidity are higher than outside gong et al 2021 these factors all affect water and energy fluxes and energy partitioning in a greenhouse energy partitioning is primarily affected by irrigation methods soil water constraints crop management practices and greenhouse whitening misting and ventilation baille et al 2001 katsoulas et al 2001 kittas et al 2001 qiu et al 2011 thus energy fluxes and partitioning in a solar greenhouse differ from those in an open field to our knowledge there have been few studies that investigated the energy budget in a solar greenhouse especially on an hourly scale the main component of energy flux is λet which needs to be accurately measured when studying an energy budget there are many techniques that are used to directly or indirectly measure λet in an open field such as water balance lysimeters eddy covariance bowen ratio energy balance scintillometry sap flow plus microlysimeters remote sensing energy balance and satellite based methods allen et al 2011 chen et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 the water balance method has been used extensively to measure λet in a greenhouse e g qiu et al 2015 with a recommended calculation period of seven days or longer to ensure accuracy allen et al 2011 li et al 2020 attempted to measure hourly λet in a greenhouse using the bowen ratio energy balance but this approach has limited applicability due to the uneven ground and small surface area of a greenhouse papadakis et al 1994 yan et al 2019 the weighing lysimeter has in the past been used as a precise method of measuring crop λet libardi et al 2018 and have been extensively used in open fields to provide accurate hourly λet anapalli et al 2016 benli et al 2006 ding et al 2010 marek et al 2016 puppo et al 2019 xu and chen 2005 however the use of weighing lysimeters to measure λet for greenhouse crops such as tomatoes is now rare although the use of this technology has been reported for prairie grass and sugarcane libardi et al 2019 long term continuous and accurate determination of λet is necessary to accurately quantify exchange of water and energy between atmosphere and soil surface seasonal variation in λet is influenced by various physical and physiological factors physical factors can be quantified by the priestley taylor coefficient α the bowen ratio β and the decoupling factor ω physiological factors are represented by canopy conductance g c ding et al 2015 jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 jiao et al 2018 the priestley taylor coefficient α is defined as the ratio of λet to equilibrium evapotranspiration its use eliminates the influence of weather and it can be used to analyze the factors that control λet the bowen ratio β is the ratio of sensible heat flux to latent heat flux it is an important indicator of subsurface moisture and also indicates and reflects the energy distribution in the subsurface the canopy conductance g c represents the overall response of the crop to the environmental factors it is a key parameter in the calculation of λet models jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 investigated the response of λet to stomatal behavior they rearranged the penman monteith equation and decomposed it into two linear equations for boundary conditions when the aerodynamic conductance was very large or tended to infinity the corresponding hydrothermal transport was very efficient leading to a leaf temperature that was close to the air temperature with little effect from the input radiation the leaf surface was well coupled to the environment when the aerodynamic conductance was very small or tending to zero there was little hydrothermal transport between the surface and the atmosphere the leaf surface was poorly coupled to the environment these phenomena can be quantified and analyzed using ω many studies of field crops have investigated the influence of these factors on λet and results for different crops are inconsistent ding et al 2010 2015 suyker and verma 2008 zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2019 found that λet was determined mainly by r n and that daily λet was significantly influenced by g c shown by a good correlation between α and g c in contrast g c had a stronger influence than r n on λet for plastic film mulched cotton tian et al 2017 jiao et al 2018 compared g c ω α and β between maize and grapevine canopies they found that λet for maize was primarily determined by r n and λet for grapevines was primarily determined by g c however there have been few solar greenhouse studies that characterize the physical and physiological drivers of λet possibly because it is difficult to accurately measure hourly λet the calculation of aerodynamic conductance g a a key parameter for determining g c in a solar greenhouse differs from the calculation for an open field because wind velocity in a solar greenhouse is generally low qiu et al 2013 zhang and lemeur 1992 thus the heat transfer coefficient has generally been used to determine g a in a greenhouse the equations for calculating g a in a greenhouse vary for different modes of convection free forced or mixed convection so identification of the convection mode is critical for accurate calculation of g a the accuracy of g a will in turn affect the accuracy of g c bailey et al 1993 montero et al 2001 qiu et al 2013 yan et al 2018 zhang and lemeur 1992 hence in this study to address the current scientific problems such as unclear mechanisms of energy budget and physical and physiological factors that affect λet in greenhouse grown tomato with drip irrigation we characterize the modes of convection in the solar greenhouse quantify λet and the dynamics of the energy budget and identify the physical and physiological factors that govern λet 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and planting information

jul 13 2019 and jul 5 2020 a drip irrigation system was used with one drip line per crop row the spacing between the drippers in the line and between lines were 30 and 65 cm respectively pressure compensated emitters with discharge rate 1 1 l h 1 were used immediately after the seedlings were transplanted 20 mm water was supplied to keep them alive thereafter irrigation was scheduled according to the measurement of cumulative evaporation an evaporation pan 0 20 m in diameter and 0 11 m deep placed 0 2 m above the plant canopy was used to measure daily evaporation at 07 00 h the plants were irrigated with quantity of water equal to 90 of cumulative evaporation when cumulative evaporation reached 20 mm our previous research had shown that there was no water stress for tomato plants in solar greenhouses under this irrigation scheduling gong et al 2020 liu et al 2013 the plants were irrigated 15 times in 2016 2017 and 2019 with the total annual irrigation amount of 282 7 308 2 and

aerodynamic conductance g a mm s 1 in the greenhouse should differ from that in the open field because u 2 inside the greenhouse was low table 1 hence we calculated g a using the convective heat

mainly during precipitation events we used boundary line analysis bla to analyze the relation between α g c and lai we selected top dependent variable points for the range of each independent variable and to represent the relationships when removing or reducing other factors ding et al 2015 schafer et al 2000 bla requires that lai and g c are partitioned into several classes we divided lai into

different tomato plant growth stages during the experimental periods 2016 2017 2019 and 2020 the peak values of r s t a and vpd generally occurred in the middle and late stages the seasonal mean value of r s was high in 2016 127 2 w m 2 the values were lower but similar to each other in 2017 106 9 w m 2 2019 105 4 w m 2 and 2020 108 7 w m 2 the seasonal mean values of t a and vpd showed little variation across the four seasons ranging from 22 8 c to 23 9 c and 0 87 1 11 kpa lai reached a maximum value in the middle growth stage and then decreased slightly due to leaf senescence and plant topping interannual variation in lai was small seasonal lai was 1 76 2016 2 20 2017 1 68 2019 and 1 86 m2 m 2 2020 table 1 the characteristic dimension d varied from 20 2 to 79 6 mm with a mean annual value of 56 8 mm the mean annual value of measured u 2 was generally small for different growth stages 0 05 0 83 m s 1 leading to a low value of r e 250 590 the mean values of t c t a for different growth stages were in the range 0 45 2 04 c and the corresponding values of g r were in the range 0 72 104 3 27 104 we used hourly calculations of r e and g r in our analysis of greenhouse convection fig 2 showed an example of convection inside the solar greenhouse based on g r r e 2 wang et al 2006 heat transfer through mixed convection was approximately 59 2016 58 2017 51 2019 and 56 2020 of the total heat transfer the remainder was due to pure forced convection no periods of pure free convection were observed the values of g a were calculated using the heat transfer coefficients calculated by eqs 3 5 for different modes of convection the value of midday g a was low during the initial stage table 3 due to the lower values of lai and u 2 but it gradually increased until the middle stage mean midday period values of g a ranged from 1 15 to 36 77 mm s 1 at different growth stages these values were consistent with values reported for other greenhouses yan et al 2018 zhang and lemeur 1992 3 2 energy fluxes and partitioning diurnal variations in energy budget for the four tomato growth stages in 2016 2017 2019 and 2020 are presented in fig 3 energy flux components generally showed bell shaped curves during each growth stage typically increasing rapidly after sunrise peaking around noon and then decreasing until sunset peak hourly r n occurred between 12 00 h and 14 00 h r n varied across growth periods from 261 9 w m 2 at the initial stage to 446 1 w m 2 at the middle stage the g varied similarly to r n but lagged r n by 1 2 h maximum hourly g ranged from 26 8 to 79 7 w m 2 at different growth stages when canopy cover was low during the initial growth stage daytime g was an important consumer of r n accounting for 22 8 nocturnal g was mainly negative indicating that heat was released from the soil surface to the atmosphere overnight values of both λet and h varied greatly throughout the entire growing season fig 3 peak hourly λet occurred between 12 00 h 14 00 h varying from 73 7 w m 2 in the initial stage to 377 9 w m 2 in the middle stage daytime hourly h was generally greater than hourly λet in the initial stage but lower during other growth stages peak hourly h was high in the initial stage 214 5 w m 2 and low in the late stage 49 7 w m 2 table 2 shows daytime 8 00 18 00 h energy flux and energy partitioning at different growth stages of tomato plants in 2016 2017 2019 and 2020 the ratio λet r n increased as growth progressed into the middle stage then decreased because λet increased more rapidly than r n and reached maximum values of 88 7 2016 89 8 2017 84 8 2019 and 87 6 2020 in contrast the average values of h r n and g r n were at a maximum in the initial stage and then gradually decreased although h r n increased from the middle to the late stage we attribute this to λet progressively increasing and h and g decreasing during the growth periods table 2 seasonal mean midday period β values were 0 24 2016 0 32 2017 0 25 2019 and 0 32 2020 table 2 showing that seasonal λet was greater than h for well watered tomato plants the values of mean midday period β were 1 0 in the initial stage but 1 0 during later growth periods which indicated a transition from energy flux to λet after the initial stage the bowen ratio β can be affected by greenhouse management practices such as greenhouse whitening baille et al 2001 or misting and the ventilation system used katsoulas et al 2001 kittas et al 2001 as well as crop type irrigation and fertilizer application for example β for greenhouse grown roses was found to be 0 6 before whitening but 0 5 after whitening baille et al 2001 energy ﬂux partitioning is closely related to the underlying coverage conditions and can be quantified by lai as lai increased the ratio λet r n increased linearly fig 4a and the ratio h r n decreased linearly fig 4b both g r n and β decreased as lai increased rapidly until it reached 2 5 m2 m 2 and then gradually decreased fig 4c and d 3 3 seasonal variations and physical and physiological controls of λet seasonal variation in daily λet ω α and g c during the midday period at different growth stages is shown in fig 5 and table 3 where ω and α represent the physical factors that govern λet and g c represents the physiological factors ding et al 2015 jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 in the initial stage the rate of λet was low fig 5a as both solar radiation and canopy cover increased table 1 λet increased rapidly and reached a maximum 215 3 w m 2 in 2020 during the middle stage as a result of high plant water demand in the late stage λet decreased slightly fig 5a due to high solar radiation and a change in lai indeterminate tomato varieties are frequently grown in greenhouses because the tomato plants grow vigorously until the end of the season seasonal mean daily λet for drip irrigated greenhouse grown tomato plants was generally constant ranging from 72 1 to 80 4 w m 2 these values were consistent with values reported for solar greenhouses in northern and northwestern china li et al 2020 liu et al 2013 yuan et al 2001 however λet for greenhouse grown tomatoes was lower than for field grown tomatoes which we attributed to the high rh value low u 2 and low radiant energy in the greenhouse as a result of partially controlled microclimate in turn led to low evaporative demand harmanto et al 2005 zheng et al 2013 the value of ω varied greatly in different growth stages decreasing from 0 82 to 0 91 in the initial stage to 0 51 0 63 in the middle stage and then increasing to 0 53 0 68 in the late stage table 3 these results showed that r n influenced λet more in the initial stage than in the middle stage in our study ω was 0 5 for most of the four study years indicating that r n had more eﬀect than g c on the tomato canopy however there were 63 days when ω 0 5 during the middle and late stages indicating that g c was the primary inﬂuence on those days seasonal variation in α over the growing season was similar to that of λet it increased from 0 46 to 0 53 in the initial stage to a maximum in the range 1 26 1 48 in the middle stage and remained at a high value 0 92 1 27 in the late stage table 3 and fig 5b many studies have shown that g c is a good indicator of λet and that high values of g c correspond to high λet ding et al 2015 jiao et al 2018 liu et al 2019 we found that g c was generally low during the initial stage and then gradually increased the maximum observed value of g c was 14 6 mm s 1 fig 5d which was lower than values found for most field grown crops ding et al 2015 kelliher et al 1995 suyker and verma 2008 mean values of g c over the four years of our study were 2 67 6 66 7 97 and 7 24 mm s 1 for the initial development middle and late stages table 3 4 discussion 4 1 convection regimes in greenhouse in this study the values of r e ranged between 250 and 590 which were generally higher than those reported by qiu et al 2013 106 114 due to the more ventilation vents in our greenhouse but they were similar to those observed in a glasshouse 150 550 bailey et al 1993 the g r in this study 0 72 104 3 27 104 was lower than those observed by qiu et al 2013 4 07 104 4 13 104 but within the range of values observed by bailey et al 1993 1 104 5 104 low values of g r in the range 3 103 8 103 have also been observed in a plastic film greenhouse bailey et al 1993 more than 50 of the convection in the greenhouse in each of the four study years was mix convection using the convection classification defined by wang et al 2006 the remainder was pure forced convection which was observed mainly during the midday period when the ventilation system was fully open resulting in relatively high values of u 2 inside the greenhouse different convection regimes in greenhouses have been reported in the literature for example periods of pure free and forced convection were frequently observed in a glasshouse in the united kingdom and in spain and belgium bailey et al 1993 zhang and lemeur 1992 in contrast qiu et al 2013 found that in a solar greenhouse in northwest china mixed convection occurred for 71 81 of the study period and no pure forced convection occurred we attribute these differences in observations to differences in ventilation systems types of greenhouses and the crops grown all of which affect d u 2 and t c t a inside the greenhouse 4 2 energy budget of greenhouse grown tomato radiation reflectivity varies with moisture and coverage allen et al 1998 qiu et al 2011 and variation in r n was mainly due to short and long wave incident solar radiation and to the growth of underlying crops this phenomenon results in r n being smaller 261 9 w m 2 in the initial stage and larger 446 1 w m 2 in the middle stage the g was inversely influenced by coverage g decreased as coverage increased because as canopy cover increases less energy reaches the ground surface leading to a lower value of g similar results have been obtained for greenhouse cucumbers yan et al 2019 as canopy cover increased more energy was consumed by λet thus there was less energy available to heat the atmosphere and the soil surface resulting in low values of h and g qiu et al 2011 yang et al 1999 daytime λet accounting for 66 4 71 7 of r n was the largest constituent of r n over the entire growing season these results are consistent with the ranges reported by yuan et al 2019 for greenhouse grown cucumbers and li et al 2020 for greenhouse grown tomatoes some studies have found that the ratio λet r n was less than the ratio h r n for tomatoes and hot peppers grown in greenhouses using furrow irrigation li et al 2020 qiu et al 2011 and in one study the ratio h r n was lower than the ratio g r n for greenhouse grown cucumbers yan et al 2019 we attribute these disparities to differences in crop type planting patterns and irrigation methods negative values of hourly h frequently occurred after 16 00 h and λet r n in the afternoon during the middle and late growth periods these results indicated the occurrence of sensible heat advection liu et al 2019 ding et al 2015 which increased λet in the greenhouses the southern vent facilitates the flow of warm dry air into the greenhouse which caused sensible heat advection especially when turbulent mixing was vigorous lei and yang 2010 found that in the afternoon h was a source of energy due to induced sensible heat advection resulting in measured λet being greater than equilibrium λet petrone et al 2006 this phenomenon has often been observed in glasshouses baille et al 2001 katsoulas et al 2001 kittas et al 2001 energy partitioning has been shown to be strongly influenced by lai hammerle et al 2008 shen et al 2004 we reached a similar conclusion as lai increased λet r n increased while h r n decreased fig 4a and b similar results have been found for other plants such as hot peppers in a greenhouse qiu et al 2011 and for ecosystems such as tallgrass prairie burba and verma 2005 and grazing land on a steppe li et al 2006 the g r n and β decrease logarithmically as lai increased when lai 2 5 m2 m 2 which may be attributed to that the effective energy intercepted by the crop canopy will no longer increase when lai was greater than the effective threshold qiu et al 2011 fitted an exponential function to show the relationship between g r n and lai gong et al 2017a b and lei and yang 2010 also showed that β decreased gradually until the crop canopy fully shaded the ground 4 3 physical and physiological controls on et high ω values indicate a strong decoupling between canopy and atmosphere baldocchi and xu 2007 jiao et al 2018 liu et al 2019 tian et al 2017 and imply that the vapor transfer process in the greenhouse is weak high values of ω were found frequently in the initial stage at the start of the middle stage lai was large and potential evapotranspiration was high and water vapor transport gradually enhanced resulting in lower values of ω this is not surprising because g a was low in the initial stage table 3 when λet was largely governed by r n katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 while during the middle growth period the increased value of g c table 3 had a greater effect on λet than in other growth periods eq 11 the value of ω was 0 5 fig 5c for most of the growing season which indicated that r n had a greater effect on λet than g c while other studies of greenhouse grown crops have found that stomatic activity had little effect on λet and that λet was principally determined by radiant energy gong et al 2017a b qiu et al 2011 the value of ω that we determined was greater than values found for field crops grown in arid regions such as cotton or grapes jiao et al 2018 tian et al 2017 which indicated that radiation has more effect on λet in greenhouses than in open fields ding et al 2015 this is not surprising because g a in greenhouses is much lower than in an open field as a result of lower u 2 which leads to the greenhouse atmosphere being strongly decoupled from the canopy katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 since λet is primarily determined by r n as earlier discussed we investigated α normalized λet which we used to quantify the relationship between λet and physiological factors the values of α were related to the amount of energy received by the plant leaves and thus its behavior is partly explained by changes in lai boundary line analysis showed that α increased logarithmically as lai increased fig 6a which indicated that the rate of energy absorption by the canopy increased as the crop grew this result differs from that found for field grown maize where the lai threshold was determined to be 2 8 m2 m 2 jiao et al 2018 zhang et al 2010 we attribute the slight decrease in α in the late stage to leaf senescence and an associated decrease in physiological activity which inhibited λet the value of α was 1 0 after the initial stage which indicated that λet was constrained by available energy rather by water lei and yang 2010 tian et al 2017 the value of α was greater than the reference value of 1 26 during most of the middle growth period which suggested that the tomato plants fully used the available energy and that sensible heat advection may have provided additional energy for λet the seasonal mean value of midday α in this study was 1 03 0 05 which was consistent with the value found by valdés gómez et al 2009 for greenhouse grown tomatoes however this value was lower than densely panted crops e g maize and rice paddy liu et al 2019 jiao et al 2018 and higher than for sparse field planted crops e g grapevines jiao et al 2018 which may be attributed to the influence of different climate conditions and varying soil water availability when α was unknown it could be estimated from β we found a significant correlation between the two indexes with the regression equation α 1 29 1 β with r 2 0 866 fig 6b where the coefficient 1 29 represents the magnitude of 1 γ δ which varied with t a the g c was affected by changes in lai and leaf stomatal conductance which was influenced by relative humidity and soil moisture zhu et al 2014 in this study we found that values of g c for drip irrigated greenhouse grown tomato varied from 0 41 to 14 67 mm s 1 other studies have found g c to be in the range 8 8 50 0 mm s 1 ortega farias et al 2006 for furrow irrigated tomatoes in greenhouse which indicates that g c has a great effect on λet kelliher et al 1995 large correlations have been found between g c and lai gong et al 2017a b we found that g c increased rapidly as lai increased until lai reached 2 5 m2 m 2 when it remained steady fig 6c which suggested that for greenhouse grown tomatoes lai 2 5 m2 m 2 was a reasonable threshold value for the effect of lai on λet however it has been found that for field grown rice and maize biweekly or monthly mean g c increased linearly as lai increased liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 we attribute this to the use of a different time scale used for analysis some greenhouse management practices such as greenhouse whitening and misting and ventilation use have also been shown to increase g c baille et al 2001 katsoulas et al 2001 kittas et al 2001 the value of α significantly increased as g c increased and then varied slightly when g c 10 mm s 1 fig 6d which indicated that daily λet was significantly influenced by g c through α previous studies have found that α indicates different thresholds of g c for different crops threshold values of g c tend to be 10 mm s 1 for spring maize gao et al 2018 and for mulched cotton in arid regions tian et al 2017 however the threshold values are 10 20 mm s 1 of g c for most field grown crops ding et al 2013 jiao et al 2018 suyker and verma 2008 zhang et al 2016 we noted that α increased to 1 72 2 24 on some days due to advection in these cases there was no good correlation between α and g c and α was large even for small values of g c similar results have been observed for irrigated field grown crops ding et al 2013 liu et al 2019 5 conclusions we investigated energy partitioning for greenhouse grown tomato plants with drip irrigation the physical α and ω and physiological g c parameters that drive λet were analyzed the parameter g a which influences g c was calculated for various modes of convection in the greenhouse results showed that mixed convection was the prevailing mode of convection over most of the study period complemented by pure forced convection and that pure free convection did not occur λet was the primary component of r n accounting for 66 4 71 7 of r n over the entire growth period as lai increased the ratio λet r n increased linearly while h r n g r n and β all decreased the daily rate of λet changed greatly over each growing season varying between 0 57 and 215 3 w m 2 mean seasonal et was 72 1 80 4 w m 2 the values of both α and ω were high for most days in the growing seasons which indicated that λet was influenced more by r n than g c daily λet was also significantly affected by g c particularly when g c was 10 mm s 1 these findings are important for the development of an energy driven λet model and

10001,research is ongoing to increase our understanding on the mechanisms responsible for the variation in energy fluxes in greenhouses in this study a four year experiment 2016 2017 2019 and 2020 was carried out to investigate the energy budget for drip irrigated tomato plants in a greenhouse where the latent heat flux λet was measured by two weighing lysimeters factors that determine energy budget and λet were also investigated the results indicated that λet was the principal component of net radiation r n accounting for 66 4 71 7 followed by sensible heat flux h and ground soil heat flux g the low values 0 25 0 32 of the seasonal mean midday bowen ratio β h λet also indicated that seasonal λet was greater than h for well watered tomato plants leaf area index lai strongly influenced the energy budget the ratio λet r n increased linearly as lai increased whereas h r n decreased linearly and g r n and β decreased logarithmically seasonal mean λet was 76 8 4 7 w m 2 which was less than the reported values for field crops this difference was attributed to the semi closed microclimate in the greenhouse the high values of the priestley taylor coefficient α 1 03 0 05 and the decoupling factor 0 69 0 05 showed that λet was principally determined by r n these values support the conclusion that λet was energy limited rather than water limited in the greenhouse canopy conductance g c also influenced λet as indicated by the high correlation between α and g c especially during the middle growth stage these findings are of great importance in creating an energy driven model and will lead to improved water management in greenhouse agriculture keywords aerodynamic conductance canopy conductance convection conditions decoupling factor priestley taylor coefficient 1 introduction greenhouse agriculture occupies a land area of 405 000 ha worldwide katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 solar greenhouses fig 1 supply a major proportion of vegetable crops in china they provide optimal crop production environments and maximize grower profits water and energy transfer between soil surface and the greenhouse atmosphere governs the physiological behavior of crops drives water circulation and energy storage and transforms vegetation and soil baldocchi 2001 gu et al 2005 energy from net radiation r n that is converted into sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux λet is significantly affected by irrigation vegetation growth and the greenhouse microclimate gong et al 2017a b jiao et al 2018 liu et al 2019 a good understanding of the behavior of energy components is important for improving water management and optimizing irrigation scheduling baldocchi 1994 chen et al 2019 ding et al 2013 youssef and giuseppe 2005 there have been many studies of water and heat energy transfer within open field ecosystems ai and yang 2016 gong et al 2017a b liu et al 2019 tian et al 2017 wang et al 2020 yan et al 2017 yu et al 2017 in which energy flux and crop evapotranspiration et vary under different climate conditions and soils the microclimate of a solar greenhouse differs considerably from that of an open field the greenhouse receives less energy due to the polyethylene sheeting covering the structure internal wind speed is low due to the greenhouse being partially closed to external meteorological activity and internal temperature and relative humidity are higher than outside gong et al 2021 these factors all affect water and energy fluxes and energy partitioning in a greenhouse energy partitioning is primarily affected by irrigation methods soil water constraints crop management practices and greenhouse whitening misting and ventilation baille et al 2001 katsoulas et al 2001 kittas et al 2001 qiu et al 2011 thus energy fluxes and partitioning in a solar greenhouse differ from those in an open field to our knowledge there have been few studies that investigated the energy budget in a solar greenhouse especially on an hourly scale the main component of energy flux is λet which needs to be accurately measured when studying an energy budget there are many techniques that are used to directly or indirectly measure λet in an open field such as water balance lysimeters eddy covariance bowen ratio energy balance scintillometry sap flow plus microlysimeters remote sensing energy balance and satellite based methods allen et al 2011 chen et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 the water balance method has been used extensively to measure λet in a greenhouse e g qiu et al 2015 with a recommended calculation period of seven days or longer to ensure accuracy allen et al 2011 li et al 2020 attempted to measure hourly λet in a greenhouse using the bowen ratio energy balance but this approach has limited applicability due to the uneven ground and small surface area of a greenhouse papadakis et al 1994 yan et al 2019 the weighing lysimeter has in the past been used as a precise method of measuring crop λet libardi et al 2018 and have been extensively used in open fields to provide accurate hourly λet anapalli et al 2016 benli et al 2006 ding et al 2010 marek et al 2016 puppo et al 2019 xu and chen 2005 however the use of weighing lysimeters to measure λet for greenhouse crops such as tomatoes is now rare although the use of this technology has been reported for prairie grass and sugarcane libardi et al 2019 long term continuous and accurate determination of λet is necessary to accurately quantify exchange of water and energy between atmosphere and soil surface seasonal variation in λet is influenced by various physical and physiological factors physical factors can be quantified by the priestley taylor coefficient α the bowen ratio β and the decoupling factor ω physiological factors are represented by canopy conductance g c ding et al 2015 jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 jiao et al 2018 the priestley taylor coefficient α is defined as the ratio of λet to equilibrium evapotranspiration its use eliminates the influence of weather and it can be used to analyze the factors that control λet the bowen ratio β is the ratio of sensible heat flux to latent heat flux it is an important indicator of subsurface moisture and also indicates and reflects the energy distribution in the subsurface the canopy conductance g c represents the overall response of the crop to the environmental factors it is a key parameter in the calculation of λet models jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 investigated the response of λet to stomatal behavior they rearranged the penman monteith equation and decomposed it into two linear equations for boundary conditions when the aerodynamic conductance was very large or tended to infinity the corresponding hydrothermal transport was very efficient leading to a leaf temperature that was close to the air temperature with little effect from the input radiation the leaf surface was well coupled to the environment when the aerodynamic conductance was very small or tending to zero there was little hydrothermal transport between the surface and the atmosphere the leaf surface was poorly coupled to the environment these phenomena can be quantified and analyzed using ω many studies of field crops have investigated the influence of these factors on λet and results for different crops are inconsistent ding et al 2010 2015 suyker and verma 2008 zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2019 found that λet was determined mainly by r n and that daily λet was significantly influenced by g c shown by a good correlation between α and g c in contrast g c had a stronger influence than r n on λet for plastic film mulched cotton tian et al 2017 jiao et al 2018 compared g c ω α and β between maize and grapevine canopies they found that λet for maize was primarily determined by r n and λet for grapevines was primarily determined by g c however there have been few solar greenhouse studies that characterize the physical and physiological drivers of λet possibly because it is difficult to accurately measure hourly λet the calculation of aerodynamic conductance g a a key parameter for determining g c in a solar greenhouse differs from the calculation for an open field because wind velocity in a solar greenhouse is generally low qiu et al 2013 zhang and lemeur 1992 thus the heat transfer coefficient has generally been used to determine g a in a greenhouse the equations for calculating g a in a greenhouse vary for different modes of convection free forced or mixed convection so identification of the convection mode is critical for accurate calculation of g a the accuracy of g a will in turn affect the accuracy of g c bailey et al 1993 montero et al 2001 qiu et al 2013 yan et al 2018 zhang and lemeur 1992 hence in this study to address the current scientific problems such as unclear mechanisms of energy budget and physical and physiological factors that affect λet in greenhouse grown tomato with drip irrigation we characterize the modes of convection in the solar greenhouse quantify λet and the dynamics of the energy budget and identify the physical and physiological factors that govern λet 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and planting information

compensated emitters with discharge rate 1 1 l h 1 were used immediately after the seedlings were transplanted 20 mm water was supplied to keep them alive thereafter irrigation was scheduled according to the measurement of cumulative evaporation an evaporation pan 0 20 m in diameter and 0 11 m deep placed 0 2 m above the plant canopy was used to measure daily evaporation at 07 00 h the plants were irrigated with quantity of water equal to 90 of cumulative evaporation when cumulative evaporation reached 20 mm our previous research had shown that there was no water stress for tomato plants in solar greenhouses under this irrigation scheduling gong et al 2020 liu et al 2013 the plants were irrigated 15 times in 2016 2017 and 2019 with the total annual irrigation amount of 282 7 308 2 and

aerodynamic conductance g a mm s 1 in the greenhouse should differ from that in the open field because u 2 inside the greenhouse was low table 1 hence we calculated g a using the convective heat

the midday period 11 00 15 00 h in order to avoid numerical instability as the denominator approached 0 midday period data were excluded from the calculation of these parameters when r n 100 w m 2 mainly during precipitation events we used boundary line analysis bla to analyze the relation between α g c and lai we selected top dependent variable points for the range of each independent variable and to represent the relationships when removing or reducing other factors ding et al 2015 schafer et al 2000 bla requires that lai and g c are partitioned into several classes we divided lai into

topping interannual variation in lai was small seasonal lai was 1 76 2016 2 20 2017 1 68 2019 and 1 86 m2 m 2 2020 table 1 the characteristic dimension d varied from 20 2 to 79 6 mm with a mean annual value of 56 8 mm the mean annual value of measured u 2 was generally small for different growth stages 0 05 0 83 m s 1 leading to a low value of r e 250 590 the mean values of t c t a for different growth stages were in the range 0 45 2 04 c and the corresponding values of g r were in the range 0 72 104 3 27 104 we used hourly calculations of r e and g r in our analysis of greenhouse convection fig 2 showed an example of convection inside the solar greenhouse based on g r r e 2 wang et al 2006 heat transfer through mixed convection was approximately 59 2016 58 2017 51 2019 and 56 2020 of the total heat transfer the remainder was due to pure forced convection no periods of pure free convection were observed the values of g a were calculated using the heat transfer coefficients calculated by eqs 3 5 for different modes of convection the value of midday g a was low during the initial stage table 3 due to the lower values of lai and u 2 but it gradually increased until the middle stage mean midday period values of g a ranged from 1 15 to 36 77 mm s 1 at different growth stages these values were consistent with values reported for other greenhouses yan et al 2018 zhang and lemeur 1992 3 2 energy fluxes and partitioning diurnal variations in energy budget for the four tomato growth stages in 2016 2017 2019 and 2020 are presented in fig 3 energy flux components generally showed bell shaped curves during each growth stage typically increasing rapidly after sunrise peaking around noon and then decreasing until sunset peak hourly r n occurred between 12 00 h and 14 00 h r n varied across growth periods from 261 9 w m 2 at the initial stage to 446 1 w m 2 at the middle stage the g varied similarly to r n but lagged r n by 1 2 h maximum hourly g ranged from 26 8 to 79 7 w m 2 at different growth stages when canopy cover was low during the initial growth stage daytime g was an important consumer of r n accounting for 22 8 nocturnal g was mainly negative indicating that heat was released from the soil surface to the atmosphere overnight values of both λet and h varied greatly throughout the entire growing season fig 3 peak hourly λet occurred between 12 00 h 14 00 h varying from 73 7 w m 2 in the initial stage to 377 9 w m 2 in the middle stage daytime hourly h was generally greater than hourly λet in the initial stage but lower during other growth stages peak hourly h was high in the initial stage 214 5 w m 2 and low in the late stage 49 7 w m 2 table 2 shows daytime 8 00 18 00 h energy flux and energy partitioning at different growth stages of tomato plants in 2016 2017 2019 and 2020 the ratio λet r n increased as growth progressed into the middle stage then decreased because λet increased more rapidly than r n and reached maximum values of 88 7 2016 89 8 2017 84 8 2019 and 87 6 2020 in contrast the average values of h r n and g r n were at a maximum in the initial stage and then gradually decreased although h r n increased from the middle to the late stage we attribute this to λet progressively increasing and h and g decreasing during the growth periods table 2 seasonal mean midday period β values were 0 24 2016 0 32 2017 0 25 2019 and 0 32 2020 table 2 showing that seasonal λet was greater than h for well watered tomato plants the values of mean midday period β were 1 0 in the initial stage but 1 0 during later growth periods which indicated a transition from energy flux to λet after the initial stage the bowen ratio β can be affected by greenhouse management practices such as greenhouse whitening baille et al 2001 or misting and the ventilation system used katsoulas et al 2001 kittas et al 2001 as well as crop type irrigation and fertilizer application for example β for greenhouse grown roses was found to be 0 6 before whitening but 0 5 after whitening baille et al 2001 energy ﬂux partitioning is closely related to the underlying coverage conditions and can be quantified by lai as lai increased the ratio λet r n increased linearly fig 4a and the ratio h r n decreased linearly fig 4b both g r n and β decreased as lai increased rapidly until it reached 2 5 m2 m 2 and then gradually decreased fig 4c and d 3 3 seasonal variations and physical and physiological controls of λet seasonal variation in daily λet ω α and g c during the midday period at different growth stages is shown in fig 5 and table 3 where ω and α represent the physical factors that govern λet and g c represents the physiological factors ding et al 2015 jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 in the initial stage the rate of λet was low fig 5a as both solar radiation and canopy cover increased table 1 λet increased rapidly and reached a maximum 215 3 w m 2 in 2020 during the middle stage as a result of high plant water demand in the late stage λet decreased slightly fig 5a due to high solar radiation and a change in lai indeterminate tomato varieties are frequently grown in greenhouses because the tomato plants grow vigorously until the end of the season seasonal mean daily λet for drip irrigated greenhouse grown tomato plants was generally constant ranging from 72 1 to 80 4 w m 2 these values were consistent with values reported for solar greenhouses in northern and northwestern china li et al 2020 liu et al 2013 yuan et al 2001 however λet for greenhouse grown tomatoes was lower than for field grown tomatoes which we attributed to the high rh value low u 2 and low radiant energy in the greenhouse as a result of partially controlled microclimate in turn led to low evaporative demand harmanto et al 2005 zheng et al 2013 the value of ω varied greatly in different growth stages decreasing from 0 82 to 0 91 in the initial stage to 0 51 0 63 in the middle stage and then increasing to 0 53 0 68 in the late stage table 3 these results showed that r n influenced λet more in the initial stage than in the middle stage in our study ω was 0 5 for most of the four study years indicating that r n had more eﬀect than g c on the tomato canopy however there were 63 days when ω 0 5 during the middle and late stages indicating that g c was the primary inﬂuence on those days seasonal variation in α over the growing season was similar to that of λet it increased from 0 46 to 0 53 in the initial stage to a maximum in the range 1 26 1 48 in the middle stage and remained at a high value 0 92 1 27 in the late stage table 3 and fig 5b many studies have shown that g c is a good indicator of λet and that high values of g c correspond to high λet ding et al 2015 jiao et al 2018 liu et al 2019 we found that g c was generally low during the initial stage and then gradually increased the maximum observed value of g c was 14 6 mm s 1 fig 5d which was lower than values found for most field grown crops ding et al 2015 kelliher et al 1995 suyker and verma 2008 mean values of g c over the four years of our study were 2 67 6 66 7 97 and 7 24 mm s 1 for the initial development middle and late stages table 3 4 discussion 4 1 convection regimes in greenhouse in this study the values of r e ranged between 250 and 590 which were generally higher than those reported by qiu et al 2013 106 114 due to the more ventilation vents in our greenhouse but they were similar to those observed in a glasshouse 150 550 bailey et al 1993 the g r in this study 0 72 104 3 27 104 was lower than those observed by qiu et al 2013 4 07 104 4 13 104 but within the range of values observed by bailey et al 1993 1 104 5 104 low values of g r in the range 3 103 8 103 have also been observed in a plastic film greenhouse bailey et al 1993 more than 50 of the convection in the greenhouse in each of the four study years was mix convection using the convection classification defined by wang et al 2006 the remainder was pure forced convection which was observed mainly during the midday period when the ventilation system was fully open resulting in relatively high values of u 2 inside the greenhouse different convection regimes in greenhouses have been reported in the literature for example periods of pure free and forced convection were frequently observed in a glasshouse in the united kingdom and in spain and belgium bailey et al 1993 zhang and lemeur 1992 in contrast qiu et al 2013 found that in a solar greenhouse in northwest china mixed convection occurred for 71 81 of the study period and no pure forced convection occurred we attribute these differences in observations to differences in ventilation systems types of greenhouses and the crops grown all of which affect d u 2 and t c t a inside the greenhouse 4 2 energy budget of greenhouse grown tomato radiation reflectivity varies with moisture and coverage allen et al 1998 qiu et al 2011 and variation in r n was mainly due to short and long wave incident solar radiation and to the growth of underlying crops this phenomenon results in r n being smaller 261 9 w m 2 in the initial stage and larger 446 1 w m 2 in the middle stage the g was inversely influenced by coverage g decreased as coverage increased because as canopy cover increases less energy reaches the ground surface leading to a lower value of g similar results have been obtained for greenhouse cucumbers yan et al 2019 as canopy cover increased more energy was consumed by λet thus there was less energy available to heat the atmosphere and the soil surface resulting in low values of h and g qiu et al 2011 yang et al 1999 daytime λet accounting for 66 4 71 7 of r n was the largest constituent of r n over the entire growing season these results are consistent with the ranges reported by yuan et al 2019 for greenhouse grown cucumbers and li et al 2020 for greenhouse grown tomatoes some studies have found that the ratio λet r n was less than the ratio h r n for tomatoes and hot peppers grown in greenhouses using furrow irrigation li et al 2020 qiu et al 2011 and in one study the ratio h r n was lower than the ratio g r n for greenhouse grown cucumbers yan et al 2019 we attribute these disparities to differences in crop type planting patterns and irrigation methods negative values of hourly h frequently occurred after 16 00 h and λet r n in the afternoon during the middle and late growth periods these results indicated the occurrence of sensible heat advection liu et al 2019 ding et al 2015 which increased λet in the greenhouses the southern vent facilitates the flow of warm dry air into the greenhouse which caused sensible heat advection especially when turbulent mixing was vigorous lei and yang 2010 found that in the afternoon h was a source of energy due to induced sensible heat advection resulting in measured λet being greater than equilibrium λet petrone et al 2006 this phenomenon has often been observed in glasshouses baille et al 2001 katsoulas et al 2001 kittas et al 2001 energy partitioning has been shown to be strongly influenced by lai hammerle et al 2008 shen et al 2004 we reached a similar conclusion as lai increased λet r n increased while h r n decreased fig 4a and b similar results have been found for other plants such as hot peppers in a greenhouse qiu et al 2011 and for ecosystems such as tallgrass prairie burba and verma 2005 and grazing land on a steppe li et al 2006 the g r n and β decrease logarithmically as lai increased when lai 2 5 m2 m 2 which may be attributed to that the effective energy intercepted by the crop canopy will no longer increase when lai was greater than the effective threshold qiu et al 2011 fitted an exponential function to show the relationship between g r n and lai gong et al 2017a b and lei and yang 2010 also showed that β decreased gradually until the crop canopy fully shaded the ground 4 3 physical and physiological controls on et high ω values indicate a strong decoupling between canopy and atmosphere baldocchi and xu 2007 jiao et al 2018 liu et al 2019 tian et al 2017 and imply that the vapor transfer process in the greenhouse is weak high values of ω were found frequently in the initial stage at the start of the middle stage lai was large and potential evapotranspiration was high and water vapor transport gradually enhanced resulting in lower values of ω this is not surprising because g a was low in the initial stage table 3 when λet was largely governed by r n katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 while during the middle growth period the increased value of g c table 3 had a greater effect on λet than in other growth periods eq 11 the value of ω was 0 5 fig 5c for most of the growing season which indicated that r n had a greater effect on λet than g c while other studies of greenhouse grown crops have found that stomatic activity had little effect on λet and that λet was principally determined by radiant energy gong et al 2017a b qiu et al 2011 the value of ω that we determined was greater than values found for field crops grown in arid regions such as cotton or grapes jiao et al 2018 tian et al 2017 which indicated that radiation has more effect on λet in greenhouses than in open fields ding et al 2015 this is not surprising because g a in greenhouses is much lower than in an open field as a result of lower u 2 which leads to the greenhouse atmosphere being strongly decoupled from the canopy katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 since λet is primarily determined by r n as earlier discussed we investigated α normalized λet which we used to quantify the relationship between λet and physiological factors the values of α were related to the amount of energy received by the plant leaves and thus its behavior is partly explained by changes in lai boundary line analysis showed that α increased logarithmically as lai increased fig 6a which indicated that the rate of energy absorption by the canopy increased as the crop grew this result differs from that found for field grown maize where the lai threshold was determined to be 2 8 m2 m 2 jiao et al 2018 zhang et al 2010 we attribute the slight decrease in α in the late stage to leaf senescence and an associated decrease in physiological activity which inhibited λet the value of α was 1 0 after the initial stage which indicated that λet was constrained by available energy rather by water lei and yang 2010 tian et al 2017 the value of α was greater than the reference value of 1 26 during most of the middle growth period which suggested that the tomato plants fully used the available energy and that sensible heat advection may have provided additional energy for λet the seasonal mean value of midday α in this study was 1 03 0 05 which was consistent with the value found by valdés gómez et al 2009 for greenhouse grown tomatoes however this value was lower than densely panted crops e g maize and rice paddy liu et al 2019 jiao et al 2018 and higher than for sparse field planted crops e g grapevines jiao et al 2018 which may be attributed to the influence of different climate conditions and varying soil water availability when α was unknown it could be estimated from β we found a significant correlation between the two indexes with the regression equation α 1 29 1 β with r 2 0 866 fig 6b where the coefficient 1 29 represents the magnitude of 1 γ δ which varied with t a the g c was affected by changes in lai and leaf stomatal conductance which was influenced by relative humidity and soil moisture zhu et al 2014 in this study we found that values of g c for drip irrigated greenhouse grown tomato varied from 0 41 to 14 67 mm s 1 other studies have found g c to be in the range 8 8 50 0 mm s 1 ortega farias et al 2006 for furrow irrigated tomatoes in greenhouse which indicates that g c has a great effect on λet kelliher et al 1995 large correlations have been found between g c and lai gong et al 2017a b we found that g c increased rapidly as lai increased until lai reached 2 5 m2 m 2 when it remained steady fig 6c which suggested that for greenhouse grown tomatoes lai 2 5 m2 m 2 was a reasonable threshold value for the effect of lai on λet however it has been found that for field grown rice and maize biweekly or monthly mean g c increased linearly as lai increased liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 we attribute this to the use of a different time scale used for analysis some greenhouse management practices such as greenhouse whitening and misting and ventilation use have also been shown to increase g c baille et al 2001 katsoulas et al 2001 kittas et al 2001 the value of α significantly increased as g c increased and then varied slightly when g c 10 mm s 1 fig 6d which indicated that daily λet was significantly influenced by g c through α previous studies have found that α indicates different thresholds of g c for different crops threshold values of g c tend to be 10 mm s 1 for spring maize gao et al 2018 and for mulched cotton in arid regions tian et al 2017 however the threshold values are 10 20 mm s 1 of g c for most field grown crops ding et al 2013 jiao et al 2018 suyker and verma 2008 zhang et al 2016 we noted that α increased to 1 72 2 24 on some days due to advection in these cases there was no good correlation between α and g c and α was large even for small values of g c similar results have been observed for irrigated field grown crops ding et al 2013 liu et al 2019 5 conclusions we investigated energy partitioning for greenhouse grown tomato plants with drip irrigation the physical α and ω and physiological g c parameters that drive λet were analyzed the parameter g a which influences g c was calculated for various modes of convection in the greenhouse results showed that mixed convection was the prevailing mode of convection over most of the study period complemented by pure forced convection and that pure free convection did not occur λet was the primary component of r n accounting for 66 4 71 7 of r n over the entire growth period as lai increased the ratio λet r n increased linearly while h r n g r n and β all decreased the daily rate of λet changed greatly over each growing season varying between 0 57 and 215 3 w m 2 mean seasonal et was 72 1 80 4 w m 2 the values of both α and ω were high for most days in the growing seasons which indicated that λet was influenced more by r n than g c daily λet was also significantly affected by g c particularly when g c was 10 mm s 1 these findings are important for the development of an energy driven λet model and for improved water management in a greenhouse declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

10002,a large amount of continuous input data is used to estimate groundwater level gwl by using machine learning models however data collection is very difficult and costly in undeveloped countries therefore obtaining a general model and using less input data is the key to popularizing the application of machine learning models for estimating groundwater levels this study evaluated the potential of the kernel based nonlinear extension of the arps decline model knea long short term memory network lstm and gated recurrent unit gru for accurately estimating gwl in the hetao irrigation district in china all models were developed using monthly records from 143 monitoring wells between 1990 and 2015 eight input combinations including the one month prior gwl air temperature global solar radiation precipitation and amount of irrigation were applied to explore the possibility of improving model accuracy using less input data in addition the general performance of the models was evaluated by cross validation the results showed that the knea model was superior to the lstm and gru models for all input combinations using the local application for cross district application the average statistical results indicated that the lstm rmse 0 45 m and r2 0 78 and gru rmse 0 48 m and r2 0 76 models performed better than the knea model rmse 0 70 m and r2 0 62 and the lstm model achieved the highest accuracy and stability for input data these three models had difficulty obtaining satisfactory monthly gwls using meteorological and irrigation data without pervious gwl data adding meteorological data on the basis of the historical gwl greatly improved the accuracy of the models compared with prec and gsr adding temperature input had the best improvement however adding large scale average irrigation data did not significantly improve the accuracy of the models in addition the lstm model and input data of the historical gwls and temperature were recommended in arid and semiarid agricultural areas with limited data keywords machine learning models groundwater lstm knea gru 1 introduction groundwater refers to the gravitational water existing in the lowest layer of the soil including water in soil pores in the saturation zone and is an important freshwater resource jia et al 2020 accurate groundwater level gwl prediction helps to ensure a reliable water supply for life agriculture industry and ecological supplements thomann et al 2020 zhang et al 2018b however gwl is highly nonlinear and complex due to the influence of hydrology geology topography meteorology climate and human activities which pose great challenges to accurately predicting gwl malekzadeh et al 2019 the model for predicting gwl can be generally divided into two types physical process based models and machine learning ml models most physical models are based on hydrodynamic mechanisms and the principle of water balance and the most commonly used are modflow harbaugh 2005 niswonger 2020 and hydrus simunek et al 1998 running these models to simulate complex hydrological processes is usually economically and computationally expensive as they generally require large amounts of spatiotemporal data as input and a variety of physical parameters for calibration in addition the uncertainty of hydrological geological topographic and meteorological data poses great challenges to the calibration and verification of numerical models zhang et al 2018b in contrast ml models can solve the nonlinear relationships between gwl and its explanatory variables e g meteorology and topography and are relatively inexpensive and fast to run compared with physical process based models jeong and park 2019 sharafati et al 2020 the ml model also does not require prior information such as model parameters that represent hydraulic characteristics and boundary conditions despite the lack of a solution to the physical process previous studies have found that ml models generally perform better than physical models in simulating gwl changes especially for mid to long term simulation periods demissie et al 2009 ebrahimi and rajaee 2017 fienen et al 2016 rahman et al 2020 rajaee et al 2019 in recent years different ml algorithms have been developed to predict regional gwl including 1 artificial neural networks anns iqbal et al 2020 mao et al 2002 such as the feed forward neural networks fnns taormina et al 2012 recurrent neural networks rnns jeong et al 2020 multilayer perceptron networks mlps lallahem et al 2005 radial basis function networks rbfs deep neural networks dnns jeong and park 2019 long short term memory lstm zhang et al 2018a and gated recurrent unit gru jeong and park 2019 2 kernel based algorithms such as support vector machine svm moravej et al 2020 panahi et al 2020 and extreme learning machine elm malekzadeh et al 2019 3 fuzzy algorithms such as adaptive network fuzzy inference system anfis gong et al 2016 khaki et al 2015 4 evolutionary algorithms such as gene expression programming gep khaki et al 2015 and 5 tree based algorithms such as random forest rf naghibi et al 2020 among these ml algorithms the artificial neural network ann was proposed the earliest and has been widely applied rakhshandehroo et al 2012 compared the performance of four ann models i e fnn rbf rnn and elman neural network for predicting gwl on the shiraz plain iran in their study the input data of the model included rainfall gwl temperature runoff and evaporation and the results demonstrated that the best performance was achieved by the fnn model sun et al 2016 employed another ann model i e mlp model to predict daily gwl in a swamp forest in singapore by inputting the surrounding reservoir water table and precipitation which showed that the mlp model produced better predictions than multiple linear regressions ghose et al 2018 studied the performances of rnn models in predicting the monthly gwl of a well in orissa india precipitation temperature humidity runoff and evapotranspiration were selected as the inputs and it was found that the rnn models could successfully predict gwl lee et al 2019 and kouziokas et al 2018 applied the fnn model to forecast hourly and daily gwl in the yangpyeong riverside area south korea and montgomery county pennsylvania usa respectively and achieved good simulation results zhang et al 2018a developed an lstm model for predicting gwl in the agricultural areas in hetao irrigation district in china later jeong and park 2019 evaluated and compared the dnn lstm gru and an autoregressive exogenous model for predicting gwl in the jindo uisin and pohang gibuk monitoring wells they found that the lstm model was superior to the dnn model and gru model in prediction accuracy kernel based algorithms are also widely applied to forecast gwl rajaee et al 2019 reviewed the application of ml models in gwl prediction and found that more than 20 papers on svm models and their derivatives have been published yoon et al 2011 developed ann and svm models to predict gwl variations in two wells in a coastal aquifer in south korea using past gwl precipitation and tidal level as inputs they found that the svm model performed better than the ann model nie et al 2017 studied the svm model to predict the monthly gwl in jilin province china they used precipitation evaporation and temperature as inputs and found that the svm model was more accurate and had less uncertainty than the rbf ann model similar results were also found in a study by mukherjee and ramachandran 2018 who used surface water storage data from the grace satellite and meteorological data to estimate gwl using svr ann and linear regression models tang et al 2019 concluded that compared with using the classic svm model the least squares svm model performed well in predicting the gwl time series and the historical hourly gwl was the only input variable in their study previous studies have confirmed that machine learning models can be used for groundwater level assessment however their studies are all in the same area and lack verification of the general ability of the model rajaee et al 2019 for some underdeveloped areas it is difficult to obtain input data it is not possible to suggest a specific machine learning model and parameters in each area it may be necessary to use a model established in one area to predict the groundwater level in another area therefore when the machine learning model is applied it must be verified that its general performance is cross validated to find a machine learning model that is globally comprehensive in addition the accuracy of gwl simulation or prediction based on ml mainly depends on the input combination many studies have pointed out that the selection of appropriate input variables will significantly affect the general ability of ml models maier et al 2010 rahman et al 2020 sahoo et al 2017a rajaee et al 2019 reviewed previous studies and found that gwl was the most valuable input variable followed by rainfall in addition temperature evaporation and pumping water volume were also commonly used as input variables in agricultural areas the amount of irrigation also significantly affects gwl zhang et al 2018a however the acquisition of input data requires considerable manpower and financial support therefore it is very difficult to obtain input data in underdeveloped areas to obtain an accurate model with less input data input combinations must be considered for evaluating the performance of a ml model it can be seen from this review that ann based and kernel based ml models have been widely used in gwl prediction however a large amount of continuous input data was used in these models and these studies were based on a single well or small area data for modeling and verification due to the large spatial variation in groundwater level the overall groundwater level of a study area is more meaningful for agriculture and water resource management to obtain a regional general model the performances prediction accuracy and model stability of the lstm gru and knea models for gwl estimation were investigated by local and cross applications in the hetao irrigation district in china in addition the influence of meteorological irrigation and groundwater data as inputs on each model was also analyzed to obtain relatively high accuracy with less input data thereby providing help for ml models to estimate gwl in areas with insufficient data 2 materials and methods 2 1 lstm model the lstm model has been used for gwl prediction applications in recent studies jeong and park 2019 zhang et al 2018a the lstm is a special kind of recurrent neural network rnn but it can learn long term dependence information and avoid vanishing and exploding gradient problems the lstm model has a chain structure which is similar to the traditional rnn but the lstm model adds the cell state to store information fig 1 shows the cell structure of the lstm where xt is the input vector ht and ht 1 are the hidden states in steps t and t 1 respectively and ct and ct 1 are the cell states in steps t and t 1 respectively as shown in the structure of the lstm fig 1 ct and ht are transferred to the calculation of the next time step duan et al 2016 ct and ht are adjusted by three gates the forget gate ft input gate it and output gate ot ft specifies the information that will be removed from ct it determines new information that will be stored in ct ot determines the information in ct which will be used as output in addition ct and ht are calculated as follows 1 f t σ w x f x t w h f h t 1 b f 2 i t σ w x i x t w h i h t 1 b i 3 c ˆ t tanh w x c x t w h c h t 1 b c 4 c t f t c t 1 i t c ˆ t 5 o t σ w x o x t w h o h t 1 b o 6 h t o t tanh c t where σ is the logistic sigmoidal function is element wise multiplication of two vectors and w x f w h f w x i w h i w x c and w h c are the network weights matrices similarly b f b i b c and b o are bias vectors the f i t and o t are vectors for the activation values of the forget gate the input gate and the output gate 2 2 gru model due to the complex structure of the lstm the training process usually takes a long time to shorten the calculation time of the training process a gru model is proposed as a modification of the lstm model with a simpler structure gao et al 2020 as shown in fig 2 ht and ct are integrated into a whole in the gru compared with the lstm there are only two doors in the gru the update gate zt and reset gate rt zt is used to determine how much state information ht ct of the t 1 step will be brought into the t step rt determines how much information from the previous state is transferred to the current candidate set the updated equations in the gru cell are calculated as follows 7 r t σ w x r x t w h r h t 1 b r 8 z t σ w x z x t w h z h t 1 b z 9 c ˆ t tanh w x c x t w h c r t h t 1 b c 10 c t 1 z t c t 1 z t c ˆ t 11 h t c t where w x

bayannaoer city inner mongolia autonomous region in china and is one of the most famous irrigation areas in china in the hetao irrigation district the average annual precipitation is 169 4 mm of which approximately 70 occurs from june to september the month with the highest rainfall is august the average minimum and maximum temperatures are 3 9 14 6 and 28 4 respectively the yongji and yichang irrigation fields are two subirrigation districts in the hetao irrigation district and their areas are 181 424 ha and 327 497 ha respectively there are 68 and 75 gwl monitoring wells distributed in the yongji and yichang irrigation fields respectively fig 4 gwl was measured on a monthly basis meteorological data were the daily scale raster data obtained from the national tibetan plateau data center which were matched to each well according to the position of the gwl well because the gwl data were estimated on a monthly basis the meteorological data also used monthly average data meteorological data include temperature temp global solar radiation gsr and precipitation prec the total irrigation amount im data per month in the yongji and yichang irrigation fields were obtained from the hetao irrigation district administration the monthly changes in meteorology irrigation and groundwater in the yongji and yichang irrigation fields are shown in fig 5 the precipitation temperature and global solar radiation in the yongji irrigation field were slightly larger than those in the yichang irrigation field but the total irrigation volume of the yichang irrigation field was significantly larger 2 5 model application in this study two types of scenarios were used 1 local application the lstm gru and knea models were trained using a randomly selected subset of the data sets 70 at each irrigation district and the remaining data 30 of each irrigation district were used for testing and 2 generalized application the lstm gru and knea models were trained separately using the data set of each irrigation field while the data sets of other irrigation fields were reserved for testing due to the influence of the underlying surface type soil texture and topography the spatial variability of the gwl is relatively large it is very important to extend the model of continuous observations to the place under the lack of observation data conditions it should be noted that the yongji and yichang irrigation fields both belong to the hetao irrigation district which is located in an arid and semiarid region in northwestern china using data from these two irrigation districts to cross validate the generalized performance of the three ml models in this study would be helpful to better evaluate the applicability of the models in addition the main parameters of the three ml models were optimized using a grid search method with the parameters varying between their thresholds at a certain interval obtained from the trial and error method all parameter combinations were evaluated and the best performing combinations were employed for the subsequent model training and testing eight input combinations of temp prec gsr im and prior gwl variables were considered to estimate the gwl 1 c1 im temp prec and gsr 2 c2 gwl im temp and prec 3 c3 gwl im temp prec and gsr 4 c4 gwl im temp and gsr 5 c5 gwl temp prec and gsr 6 c6 gwl im prec and gsr 7 c7 gwl and temp and 8 c8 gwl c3 was a complete combination used to evaluate the performance of the three models while other combinations were incomplete and used to evaluate the contributions of different inputs for predicting gwl temp prec and gsr reflect the effects of meteorology on gwl in addition im can reflect the impact of agricultural management 2 6 performance evaluation the performance of the knea gru and lstm models is evaluated with the determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse in this study 2 6 1

data points and oe and om are the estimated gwl values from the knea gru and lstm models and the measured gwl values respectively om ave and oe ave are the mean estimated and measured gwl values respectively closer values of r2 values to 1 indicate better model performance while closer values of rmse or mae to 0 indicate better model performance rmse is generally useful when model errors follow a normal distribution whereas mae is better suited for models with a uniform error distribution chai and draxler 2014 nse is one of the most widely used criteria for the assessment of rainfall runoff simulation which ranges from 1 1 values of nse less than zero indicate that the simulated result is worse than using only the observed mean value for prediction 3 results 3 1 performance of the models in the yongji irrigation field for the three algorithms i e knea gru and lstm used in this study their average statistical results from the models at the yongji irrigation field under 8 different input combinations in the scenario of local data application are listed in tables 1 and 2 in the training period all models provided different accuracies for different input combinations according to the average performance of the models the knea model rmse 0 34 m r2 0 82 mae 0 24 m and nse 0 82 performed better than the gru rmse 0 40 m r2 0 79 mae 0 28 m and nse 0 78 and lstm rmse 0 38 m r2 0 79 mae 0 26 m and nse 0 82 models in general the lstm model had a better accuracy than the gru the average rmse of the knea models decreased by 15 4 and 11 8 compared with the gru and lstm models for the yongji irrigation field respectively in the testing period the lstm model performed slightly better than the gru and knea models especially for the c1 input combination the statistical results of the lstm and gru models were not much different in the training and testing periods while those of the knea model slightly decreased which meant that the lstm and gru models were more stable than the knea model as shown in tables 1 and 2 the results of the c1 input combination obtained from the three models were worse when compared with other scenarios compared with using the c1 input combination the rmse of the c8 input combination was reduced by 1 2 times r2 values increased from 0 19 to 0 28 0 79 0 82 and mae and nse were also well improved these results indicated that the historical gwl was very important for gwl prediction using the knea gru and lstm models for the knea model the statistical results of the c7 input combination rmse 0 29 m r2 0 89 mae 0 21 and nse 0 89 were greatly improved compared with using the c8 input combination rmse 0 47 m r2 0 77 mae 0 36 m and nse 0 72 but the statistical results of the c5 input combination rmse 0 26 m r2 0 91 mae 0 19 m and nse 0 91 were only slightly improved compared with c7 similar results were found in the gru and lstm models by comparing the statistical results of the c8 c7 and c5 input combinations it could be concluded that adding temperature would improve model accuracy on the basis of the prior gwl but adding global solar radiation and precipitation continually had little effect on the performance of the three models the statistical results of c2 c4 and c6 indicated that adding temperature data was the most efficient way to improve model accuracy in addition for the lstm model the statistical results of the c3 input combination rmse 0 28 m r2 0 91 mae 0 20 m and nse 0 90 and c5 input combination rmse 0 29 m r2 0 90 m mae 0 21 and nse 0 89 were little different in the testing period and the gru and knea models also had similar results which indicated that on the basis of the prior gwl and meteorological data adding the irrigation data of the entire district had little improvement on model performance correlations between the estimated gwl values using the lstm gru and knea models and their corresponding observed gwl values in the testing period are shown in fig 6 taking the no 10 monitoring well as an example it could be seen that for the same algorithm the c2 c8 input combinations were closer to the 1 1 line than the c1 input combinations the results of 8 input combinations calculated by the lstm model showed a tendency for underestimation however the results of the c4 and c6 input combinations calculated by the gru model were overestimated compared with the lstm and gru models the gwl calculated by the knea model was closer to the observed value for example the correlation r2 value of the knea model under the c6 input combination was 0 91 higher than that of the corresponding lmst model r2 0 88 or gru model r2 0 85 the patterns found in the scatterplots were consistent with the trends shown in the statistical results of the models in tables 1 and 2 the accuracy of the three models was generally higher when using the complete input combination c3 compared with other incomplete combinations therefore the c3 input combination was selected to evaluate the spatial distribution of rmse in this study overall using the knea model to estimate gwl achieved the minimum rmse of each monitoring well followed by the lstm and gru models fig 7 the rmse value of each monitoring well using the gru model was slightly larger than that using the lstm model in addition the rmse distribution of each monitoring well was relatively uniform for the knea model in the yongji irrigation field however for the lstm and gru models the rmse of the monitoring well in the south was larger than that of the monitoring well in the north 3 2 performance of the models in the yichang irrigation field tables 3 and 4 compare the accuracy of the knea lstm and gru models in estimating the gwl in the yichang irrigation field in the training period the average performances of the c1 c8 input combinations using the knea model rmse 0 41 m r2 0 83 mae 0 27 m and nse 0 82 were better than those using the lstm rmse 0 47 m r2 0 80 mae 0 30 and nse 0 79 and gru rmse 0 48 m r2 0 80 mae 0 30 m and nse 0 79 models but the average performances of the three models had little difference in the testing period the best results were obtained using the c3 input combination for all three models in both the training and testing periods moreover all models provided worse accuracy using the c1 input combination without historical gwl than those using the c2 c8 input combinations with the historical gwl in the training and testing periods tables 3 and 4 which suggests that the historical gwl was very important for the machine model to estimate gwl in the yichang irrigation field for the knea model the statistical results of the c3 input combination rmse 0 32 m r2 0 92 mae 0 21 m and nse 0 92 and c5 input combination rmse 0 33 m r2 0 92 mae 0 22 m and nse 0 92 were slightly different during the testing period in the yichang irrigation field compared with using the c8 and c5 input combinations the rmse r2 mae and nse values of the c5 input combination for the three models increased by 30 6 40 3 9 2 13 1 33 9 43 2 and 13 1 14 2 respectively during the testing period the results were similar to those of the yongji irrigation field which demonstrated that adding meteorological data on the basis of the historical gwl effectively improved the accuracy of the model but adding im had little effect on the accuracy of the model in the yichang irrigation field for the lstm model the statistical results of the c2 and c4 input combinations were better than those of the c6 input combination and the gru and knea models had similar results which indicated that the temperature in the meteorological data was more conducive than the global solar radiation and precipitation to improving the accuracy of the three models in estimating gwl in addition tables 3 and 4 reveal that the knea lstm and gru models were more successful in the yongji irrigation field than in the yichang irrigation field in contrast to the yongji irrigation field the average rmse accuracy of the knea lstm and gru models increased by 25 4 17 9 and 21 7 in the yichang irrigation field during the testing period respectively correlations between the estimated gwl values using the lstm gru and knea models and their corresponding observed gwl values in the testing period are shown in fig 8 from these scatterplots it could be seen that the results using the c2 c8 input combinations were closer to the 1 1 line than those using the c1 input combination r2 0 02 0 11 while the calculated results using the c8 input combination r2 0 81 0 83 were slightly inferior to those using the c2 c7 input combinations r2 0 90 0 92 however the correlations between the estimated gwl values using the lstm gru and knea models and the observed gwl using the c2 c8 input combinations were slightly different and were similar to the statistical results similar to the yongji irrigation field in the yichang irrigation field the c3 input combination was selected to evaluate the spatial distribution of rmse overall the rmse of each monitoring well calculated using the lstm gru and knea models had little difference and the lstm and knea models had a slightly better performance than the gru models fig 9 in addition for the three models the rmse of the monitoring well in the eastern area was larger than that of the monitoring well in the western area moreover the rmses of the three models in the yichang irrigation field were larger than those in the yongji irrigation field for the knea model the rmse distribution of each monitoring well was more uniform in the yongji irrigation field 3 3 cross validation for the yongji and yichang irrigation fields the model established in the yongji irrigation field was used to evaluate the gwl of the yichang irrigation field and the statistical results of model performance are shown in table 5 contrary to the results of the local models better results estimating gwl were achieved using the lstm and gru models and the knea models had the worst performance all three models performed worse under the c1 input combination the results of the c8 input combination were better than those of the c1 input combination which also showed that the influences of the gwl data on the model were greater than those of the meteorological data for the lstm model the statistical results of the c2 c7 combinations had little difference and the performances of the c2 and c3 input combinations were slightly better the best performances of the lstm gru and knea models were with using the c3 input combination rmse 0 31 m r2 0 89 mae 0 22 m and nse 0 85 c4 input combination rmse 0 35 m r2 0 89 mae 0 27 m and nse 0 86 and c7 input combination rmse 0 37 m r2 0 90 mae 0 26 m and nse 0 85 respectively these results indicated that the gwl could be accurately evaluated by inputting the gwl and temperature data in the early stage and adding global solar radiation precipitation and irrigation data had little improvement on model accuracy table 6 shows the statistical results of the model used to evaluate the gwl of the yongji irrigation field based on the model established in the yichang irrigation field the rmse and mae values of the knea model were the largest namely 0 82 m and 0 49 m respectively while the r2 and nse values were the smallest namely 0 56 and 0 35 respectively the performances of the lstm and gru models were better than those of the knea model but there were few differences between them similar to the model established in the yongji irrigation field all three models established in the yichang irrigation field performed poorly under the c1 input combination the lstm gru and knea models performed the best under the c3 c4 and c7 input combinations respectively compared with the yongji irrigation model the yichang irrigation model performed better during the cross test which was supported by the fact that the rmse values of the lstm gru and knea models increased by 24 5 26 5 and 31 0 respectively and the r2 values of the lstm gru and knea models increased by 8 1 1 6 and 20 1 respectively figs 10 and 11 show the correlations between the estimated gwl values sing the lstm gru and knea models and their corresponding observed gwl values in the cross validation for models developed with data from the yongji irrigation field the lstm and gru models performed better than the knea model when applied to the yichang irrigation field fig 10 however the performance of the lstm model showed little difference from the gru model and the lstm model was slightly better than the gru model moreover the gwl values estimated by the knea model were lower than the observed values during the large gwl period similar to the statistical results the model performances using the c2 c7 input combinations were better than those using the c1 and c8 input combinations in the cross validation period figs 10 and 11 in addition it could be seen from the scatterplot figures that when using the model established in the yichang irrigation field to evaluate the gwl in the yongji irrigation field estimated and observed values were closer to the 1 1 line which indicated that the yichang irrigation field model was more suitable for application in the entire region figs 12 and 13 show the rmse spatial distributions of the cross validation of the yongji and yichang irrigation fields overall the rmse values of the lstm and gru models were smaller than that of the knea model which indicated that the lstm and gru models performed better than the knea models in the cross validation period moreover the rmse values of the models established in yichang and applied in the yongji irrigation field were smaller than those of the models established in the yongji irrigation field and applied in the yichang irrigation field in addition the rmse distributions of the yongji irrigation field were relatively uniform and the rmse values of the lstm and gru models were relatively higher in the eastern part of the yichang irrigation field comparing figs 7 and 9 with figs 12 and 13 it can be seen that the rmse values of the cross validation were larger than those of the local validation 4 discussion among the three ml models the knea model had the best performance followed by the lstm and gru algorithms during the training and testing periods in local applications tables 1 and 2 this indicated that the lstm and gru models have some underfitting problems in the training process which affected the overall accuracy of the models the simplification of the gru model relative to the lstm model may have lost some important information undermining the accuracy of the model gao et al 2020 regarding the kernel based algorithm the knea model had a slight advantage in capturing nonlinear relationships however the lstm and gru models performed significantly better than the knea model in the cross application tables 5 and 6 which indicated that the lstm and gru models had stronger general capabilities this showed that the gaussian kernel function was sensitive to inputs when the distributions of external data and local data were different the width of the original gaussian kernel function was no longer suitable for the new data set causing great deviation to the output value dong et al 2019 ma and liu 2018 there have also been similar reports on the results of the differences in the performance between cross station and local application scenarios wang et al 2020 wu et al 2019 from the perspective of model applicability the general ability of a model is more important than the accuracy of local tests rajaee et al 2019 zanotti et al 2019 therefore we recommend the lstm model as the most suitable model for this area in cross validation the model established based on the data of the yichang irrigation field was better than that of the yongji irrigation field this may have been due to the difference in data quality between the two data sets behzad et al 2009 kisi 2015 lu et al 2018 the data noise of the yongji irrigation field was greater making the accuracy of the model inferior to the former therefore for the study area the model established in the yichang irrigation field was recommended as the general model for the entire area the input scenario analysis indicated that the historical gwl was very important for gwl prediction using the knea gru and lstm models similar results were found in the studies by lallahem et al 2005 and mohanty et al 2015 where different input combinations including precipitation evapotranspiration temperature river stage pumping rates etc were employed to predict gwl using the ann model in these studies in addition rajaee et al 2019 reviewed previous studies and found that gwl was the most valuable input variable a historical gwl was used as an input to provide a reference or initial value for the machine learning model to calculate the groundwater level at the next moment then the ml models adjusted the predicted gwl based on other input data therefore the historical gwls were critical input data for predicting the gwls using ml models in most cases the modeling performance of the lstm gru and knea models improved significantly with the inclusion of meteorological data similar results were found in the study by mukherjee and ramachandran 2018 meteorological data affect groundwater through their effects on evaporation and crop water consumption for meteorological data input temperature was more important than gsr and prec in our research one possible explanation for this was that the annual average precipitation in the yichang and yongji irrigation fields was less than 200 mm but the evaporation was nearly 2400 mm li et al 2020 which indicated that the dominant factor affecting fluctuations in gwl was evaporation rather than precipitation as shown in the penman monteith equation there is a significant positive correlation between temperature and evaporation however it was reported in fao56 that et0 can be calculated by using the hargreaves formula under the condition of missing data which only needs temperature as input allen et al 1998 in addition wang et al 2020 evaluated the evaporation of arid regions in northwest china by utilizing three ml models using temperature radiation relative humidity and wind speed as inputs it was found that adding radiation based on temperature input had little effect on the accuracy of the ml models which indicates that temperature may have a greater impact on evaporation than radiation moreover it is very difficult to obtain detailed radiation data and the cost is too high to bear for developing countries however temperature acquisition is relatively simple which greatly increases the possibility of using ml models to predict groundwater levels in developing countries in addition adding irrigation data to the models had little effect on the accuracy of gwl evaluation using historical gwls and meteorological data input in advance however sahoo et al 2017a found that irrigation was an important parameter for machine learning models to estimate groundwater in agricultural areas in the united states in their model the irrigation input was obtained by using the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat model in lieu of unavailable groundwater pumping records in our research irrigation water was almost diverted from the yellow river in the yichang and yongji irrigation districts diversion irrigation may have a much smaller impact on local groundwater levels than pumping groundwater for irrigation in addition the local government has invested for decades considerable manpower and material resources in the implementation of water saving irrigation the impact of irrigation on the groundwater level has gradually weakened as the amount of irrigation has decreased another possible reason for this was that the irrigation data provided in this study were the average values of the irrigation area and we had no precise irrigation data for each groundwater well therefore the average input of irrigation data might also have resulted in a weak relationship between irrigation and gwl however according to the driving force theory of groundwater movement water diversion from rivers for irrigation and groundwater extraction for irrigation significantly affect the dynamics of the gwl wang et al 2014 therefore to predict the groundwater level more accurately by using ml models more precise irrigation data are required overall we have fully evaluated the performance of the three models to predict gwl using limited data and have achieved relatively ideal and applicable results in the hetao irrigation district in addition the inputs of this study did not include many factors that affect the change in gwl such as topography soil texture and groundwater extraction moreover the locations of the two study areas are adjacent therefore the study results may not be applicable to areas with large differences in climate or soil texture therefore the next step in this study is to further verify these ml algorithms in other regions and to consider introducing remote sensing information as input including vegetation cover and actual evapotranspiration 5 conclusions in this study the performances prediction accuracy and model stability of the knea lstm and gru models for gwl estimation were compared by conducting local and cross applications these models were fed monthly data from 1990 to 2015 from two subirrigated areas in the hetao irrigation district in china eight different input combinations and four statistical indicators rmse r2 mae and nse were used for model evaluation for the local application the knea model was superior to the lstm and gru models for all input combinations for cross district applications the average statistical results indicated that the lstm and gru models performed better than the knea model and the lstm model achieved the highest accuracy and stability comprehensively considering the prediction accuracy and general ability the lstm model was recommended for monthly gwl prediction in the hetao irrigation district in addition the model established based on the data from the yichang irrigation field was better than that from the yongji irrigation field for the input data the historical groundwater level was an indispensable input for the machine learning models to accurately predict the groundwater level adding meteorological data on the basis of the historical groundwater level greatly improved the accuracy of the model compared with prec and gsr adding temperature input had the best improvement adding large scale average irrigation data did not significantly improve the accuracy of the model therefore adding easy to obtain temperature data can be used as a method to improve the accuracy of ml models for estimating gwl which provides great help for the application of ml in agricultural areas with limited data furthermore the influence of historical gwls and temperature on estimating gwl by using the knea lstm and gru models was greater than that of precipitation global solar radiation and the large scale average amount of irrigation in addition the model established based on the data from the yichang irrigation field was better than that from the yongji irrigation field therefore the model established in the yichang irrigation field was recommended as the general model for the entire study area declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10002,a large amount of continuous input data is used to estimate groundwater level gwl by using machine learning models however data collection is very difficult and costly in undeveloped countries therefore obtaining a general model and using less input data is the key to popularizing the application of machine learning models for estimating groundwater levels this study evaluated the potential of the kernel based nonlinear extension of the arps decline model knea long short term memory network lstm and gated recurrent unit gru for accurately estimating gwl in the hetao irrigation district in china all models were developed using monthly records from 143 monitoring wells between 1990 and 2015 eight input combinations including the one month prior gwl air temperature global solar radiation precipitation and amount of irrigation were applied to explore the possibility of improving model accuracy using less input data in addition the general performance of the models was evaluated by cross validation the results showed that the knea model was superior to the lstm and gru models for all input combinations using the local application for cross district application the average statistical results indicated that the lstm rmse 0 45 m and r2 0 78 and gru rmse 0 48 m and r2 0 76 models performed better than the knea model rmse 0 70 m and r2 0 62 and the lstm model achieved the highest accuracy and stability for input data these three models had difficulty obtaining satisfactory monthly gwls using meteorological and irrigation data without pervious gwl data adding meteorological data on the basis of the historical gwl greatly improved the accuracy of the models compared with prec and gsr adding temperature input had the best improvement however adding large scale average irrigation data did not significantly improve the accuracy of the models in addition the lstm model and input data of the historical gwls and temperature were recommended in arid and semiarid agricultural areas with limited data keywords machine learning models groundwater lstm knea gru 1 introduction groundwater refers to the gravitational water existing in the lowest layer of the soil including water in soil pores in the saturation zone and is an important freshwater resource jia et al 2020 accurate groundwater level gwl prediction helps to ensure a reliable water supply for life agriculture industry and ecological supplements thomann et al 2020 zhang et al 2018b however gwl is highly nonlinear and complex due to the influence of hydrology geology topography meteorology climate and human activities which pose great challenges to accurately predicting gwl malekzadeh et al 2019 the model for predicting gwl can be generally divided into two types physical process based models and machine learning ml models most physical models are based on hydrodynamic mechanisms and the principle of water balance and the most commonly used are modflow harbaugh 2005 niswonger 2020 and hydrus simunek et al 1998 running these models to simulate complex hydrological processes is usually economically and computationally expensive as they generally require large amounts of spatiotemporal data as input and a variety of physical parameters for calibration in addition the uncertainty of hydrological geological topographic and meteorological data poses great challenges to the calibration and verification of numerical models zhang et al 2018b in contrast ml models can solve the nonlinear relationships between gwl and its explanatory variables e g meteorology and topography and are relatively inexpensive and fast to run compared with physical process based models jeong and park 2019 sharafati et al 2020 the ml model also does not require prior information such as model parameters that represent hydraulic characteristics and boundary conditions despite the lack of a solution to the physical process previous studies have found that ml models generally perform better than physical models in simulating gwl changes especially for mid to long term simulation periods demissie et al 2009 ebrahimi and rajaee 2017 fienen et al 2016 rahman et al

evolutionary algorithms such as gene expression programming gep khaki et al 2015 and 5 tree based algorithms such as random forest rf naghibi et al 2020 among these ml algorithms the artificial neural network ann was proposed the earliest and has been widely applied rakhshandehroo et al 2012 compared the performance of four ann models i e fnn rbf rnn and elman neural network for predicting gwl on the shiraz plain iran in their study the input data of the model included rainfall gwl temperature runoff and evaporation and the results demonstrated that the best performance was achieved by the fnn model sun et al 2016 employed another ann model i e mlp model to predict daily gwl in a swamp forest in singapore by inputting the surrounding reservoir water table and precipitation which showed that the mlp model produced better predictions than multiple linear regressions ghose et al 2018 studied the performances of rnn models in predicting the monthly gwl of a well in orissa india precipitation temperature humidity runoff and evapotranspiration were selected as the inputs and it was found that the rnn models could successfully predict gwl lee et al 2019 and kouziokas et al 2018 applied the fnn model to forecast hourly and daily gwl in the yangpyeong riverside area south korea and montgomery county pennsylvania usa respectively and achieved good simulation results zhang et al 2018a developed an lstm model for predicting gwl in the agricultural areas in hetao irrigation district in china later jeong and park 2019 evaluated and compared the dnn lstm gru and an autoregressive exogenous model for predicting gwl in the jindo uisin and pohang gibuk monitoring wells they found that the lstm model was superior to the dnn model and gru model in prediction accuracy kernel based algorithms are also widely applied to forecast gwl rajaee et al 2019 reviewed the application of ml models in gwl prediction and found that more than 20 papers on svm models and their derivatives have been published yoon et al 2011 developed ann and svm models to predict gwl variations in two wells in a coastal aquifer in south korea using past gwl precipitation and tidal level as inputs they found that the svm model performed better than the ann model nie et al 2017 studied the svm model to predict the monthly gwl in jilin province china they used precipitation evaporation and temperature as inputs and found that the svm model was more accurate and had less uncertainty than the rbf ann model similar results were also found in a study by mukherjee and ramachandran 2018 who used surface water storage data from the grace satellite and meteorological data to estimate gwl using svr ann and linear regression models tang et al 2019 concluded that compared with using the classic svm model the least squares svm model performed well in predicting the gwl time series and the historical hourly gwl was the only input variable in their study previous studies have confirmed that machine learning models can be used for groundwater level assessment however their studies are all in the same area and lack verification of the general ability of the model rajaee et al 2019 for some underdeveloped areas it is difficult to obtain input data it is not possible to suggest a specific machine learning model and parameters in each area it may be necessary to use a model established in one area to predict the groundwater level in another area therefore when the machine learning model is applied it must be verified that its general performance is cross validated to find a machine learning model that is globally comprehensive in addition the accuracy of gwl simulation or prediction based on ml mainly depends on the input combination many studies have pointed out that the selection of appropriate input variables will significantly affect the general ability of ml models maier et al 2010 rahman et al 2020 sahoo et al 2017a rajaee et al 2019 reviewed previous studies and found that gwl was the most valuable input variable followed by rainfall in addition temperature evaporation and pumping water volume were also commonly used as input variables in agricultural areas the amount of irrigation also significantly affects gwl zhang et al 2018a however the acquisition of input data requires considerable manpower and financial support therefore it is very difficult to obtain input data in underdeveloped areas to obtain an accurate model with less input data input combinations must be considered for evaluating the performance of a ml model it can be seen from this review that ann based and kernel based ml models have been widely used in gwl prediction however a large amount of continuous input data was used in these models and these studies were based on a single well or small area data for modeling and verification due to the large spatial variation in groundwater level the overall groundwater level of a study area is more meaningful for agriculture and water resource management to obtain a regional general model the performances prediction accuracy and model stability of the lstm gru and knea models for gwl estimation were investigated by local and cross applications in the hetao irrigation district in china in addition the influence of meteorological irrigation and groundwater data as inputs on each model was also analyzed to obtain relatively high accuracy with less input data thereby providing help for ml models to estimate gwl in areas with insufficient data 2 materials and methods 2 1 lstm model the lstm model has been used for gwl prediction applications in recent studies jeong and park 2019 zhang et al 2018a the lstm is a special kind of recurrent neural network rnn but it can learn long term dependence information and avoid vanishing and exploding gradient problems the lstm model has a chain structure which is similar to the traditional rnn but the lstm model adds the cell state to store information fig 1 shows the cell structure of the lstm where xt is the input vector ht and ht 1 are the hidden states in steps t and t 1 respectively and ct and ct 1 are the cell states in steps t and t 1 respectively as shown in the structure of the lstm fig 1 ct and ht are transferred to the calculation of the next time step duan et al 2016 ct and ht are adjusted by three gates the forget gate ft input gate it and output gate ot ft specifies the information that will be removed from ct it determines new information that will be stored in ct ot determines the information in ct which will be used as output in addition ct and ht are calculated as follows 1 f t σ w x f x t w h f h t 1 b f 2 i t σ w x i x t w h i h t 1 b i 3 c ˆ t tanh w x c x t w h c h t 1 b c 4 c t f t c t 1 i t c ˆ t 5 o t σ w x o x t w h o h t 1 b

b i b c and b o are bias vectors the f i t and o t are vectors for the activation values of the forget gate the input gate and the output gate 2 2 gru model due to the complex structure of the lstm the training process usually takes a long time to shorten the calculation time of the training process a gru model is proposed as a modification of the lstm model with a simpler structure gao et al 2020 as shown in fig 2 ht and ct are integrated into a whole in the gru compared with the lstm there are only two doors in the gru the update gate zt and reset gate rt zt is used to determine how much state information ht ct of the t 1 step will be brought into the t step rt determines how much information from the previous state is transferred to the current candidate set the updated equations in the gru cell are calculated as follows 7 r t σ w x r x t w h r h t 1 b r 8 z t σ w x z x t w h z h t 1 b z 9 c ˆ t tanh w x c x t w h c r t h t 1 b c 10 c t 1 z t c t 1 z t c ˆ t 11 h t c t where w x r w h r w x z and w h z are the network weights matrices b r and b z are bias vectors and r t and z t are vectors for the activation values of the update gate and reset gate respectively 2 3 kernel based nonlinear arps decline knea the nonlinear arps decline nea ma and liu 2018 can be described as 12 f x a f x 1 g u x μ where f x is the current output value and f x 1 is the output value of the last step u x represents the influencing factor vector and g u x can be interpreted as the nonlinear relationship of influencing factors μ represents the bias a is an empirical constant from this equation it is clear that the output of the current step is the result of the joint action between the output from the last step and the influencing factors at this step the flow chart of the knea algorithm is shown below fig 3 the nonlinear function g u x is difficult to directly solve and can alternatively be translated to the high dimensional feature space to obtain a linear representation 13 g u x ω t φ u x therefore the eq 12 can be written as 14 f x a f x 1 ω t φ u x μ however the eq 14 still cannot be solved but we can find a very small value e x to make the difference between the

bayannaoer city inner mongolia autonomous region in china and is one of the most famous irrigation areas in china in the hetao irrigation district the average annual precipitation is 169 4 mm of which approximately 70 occurs from june to september the month with the highest rainfall is august the average minimum and maximum temperatures are 3 9 14 6 and 28 4 respectively the yongji and yichang irrigation fields are two subirrigation districts in the hetao irrigation district and their areas are 181 424 ha and 327 497 ha respectively there are 68 and 75 gwl monitoring wells distributed in the yongji and yichang irrigation fields respectively fig 4 gwl was measured on a monthly basis meteorological data were the daily scale raster data obtained from the national tibetan plateau data center which were matched to each well according to the position of the gwl well because the gwl data were estimated on a monthly basis the meteorological data also used monthly average data meteorological data include temperature temp global solar radiation gsr and precipitation prec the total irrigation amount im data per month in the yongji and yichang irrigation fields were obtained from the hetao irrigation district administration the monthly changes in meteorology irrigation and groundwater in the yongji and yichang irrigation fields are shown in fig 5 the precipitation temperature and global solar radiation in the yongji irrigation field were slightly larger than those in the yichang irrigation field but the total irrigation volume of the yichang irrigation field was significantly larger 2 5 model application in this study two types of scenarios were used 1 local application the lstm gru and knea models were trained using a randomly selected subset of the data sets 70 at each irrigation district and the remaining data 30 of each irrigation district were used for testing and 2 generalized application the lstm gru and knea models were trained separately using the data set of each irrigation field while the data sets of other irrigation fields were reserved for testing due to the influence of the underlying surface type soil texture and topography the spatial variability of the gwl is relatively large it is very important to extend the model of continuous observations to the place under the lack of observation data conditions it should be noted that the yongji and yichang irrigation fields both belong to the hetao irrigation district which is located in an arid and semiarid region in northwestern china using data from these two irrigation districts to cross validate the generalized performance of the three ml models in this study would be helpful to better evaluate the applicability of the models in addition the main parameters of the three ml models were optimized using a grid search method with the parameters varying between their thresholds at a certain interval obtained from the trial and error method all parameter combinations were evaluated and the best performing combinations were employed for the subsequent model training and testing eight input combinations of temp prec gsr im and prior gwl variables were considered to estimate the gwl 1 c1 im temp prec and gsr 2 c2 gwl im temp and prec 3 c3 gwl im temp prec and gsr 4 c4 gwl im temp and gsr 5 c5 gwl temp prec and gsr 6 c6 gwl im prec and gsr 7 c7 gwl and temp and 8 c8 gwl c3 was a complete combination used to evaluate the performance of the three models while other combinations were incomplete and used to evaluate the contributions of different inputs for predicting gwl temp prec and gsr reflect the effects of meteorology on gwl in addition im can reflect the impact of agricultural management 2 6 performance evaluation the performance of the knea gru and lstm models is evaluated with the determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse in this study 2 6 1

data points and oe and om are the estimated gwl values from the knea gru and lstm models and the measured gwl values respectively om ave and oe ave are the mean estimated and measured gwl values respectively closer values of r2 values to 1 indicate better model performance while closer values of rmse or mae to 0 indicate better model performance rmse is generally useful when model errors follow a normal distribution whereas mae is better suited for models with a uniform error distribution chai and draxler 2014 nse is one of the most widely used criteria for the assessment of rainfall runoff simulation which ranges from 1 1 values of nse less than zero indicate that the simulated result is worse than using only the observed mean value for prediction 3 results 3 1 performance of the models in the yongji irrigation field for the three algorithms i e knea gru and lstm used in this study their average statistical results from the models at the yongji irrigation field under 8 different input combinations in the scenario of local data application are listed in tables 1 and 2 in the training period all models provided different accuracies for different input combinations according to the average performance of the models the knea model rmse 0 34 m r2 0 82 mae 0 24 m and nse 0 82 performed better than the gru rmse 0 40 m r2 0 79 mae 0 28 m and nse 0 78 and lstm rmse 0 38 m r2 0 79 mae 0 26 m and nse 0 82 models in general the lstm model had a better accuracy than the gru the average rmse of the knea models decreased by 15 4 and 11 8 compared with the gru and lstm models for the yongji irrigation field respectively in the testing period the lstm model performed slightly better than the gru and knea models especially for the c1 input combination the statistical results of the lstm and gru models were not much different in the training and testing periods while those of the knea model slightly decreased which meant that the lstm and gru models were more stable than the knea model as shown in tables 1 and 2 the results of the c1 input combination obtained from the three models were worse when compared with other scenarios compared with using the c1 input combination the rmse of the c8 input combination was reduced by 1 2 times r2 values increased from 0 19 to 0 28 0 79 0 82 and mae and nse were also well improved these results indicated that the historical gwl was very important for gwl prediction using the knea gru and lstm models for the knea model the statistical results of the c7 input combination rmse 0 29 m r2 0 89 mae 0 21 and nse 0 89 were greatly improved compared with using the c8 input combination rmse 0 47 m r2 0 77 mae 0 36 m and nse 0 72 but the statistical results of the c5 input combination rmse 0 26 m r2 0 91 mae 0 19 m and nse 0 91 were only slightly improved compared with c7 similar results were found in the gru and lstm models by comparing the statistical results of the c8 c7 and c5 input combinations it could be concluded that adding temperature would improve model accuracy on the basis of the prior gwl but adding global solar radiation and precipitation continually had little effect on the performance of the three models the statistical results of c2 c4 and c6 indicated that adding temperature data was the most efficient way to improve model accuracy in addition for the lstm model the statistical results of the c3 input combination rmse 0 28 m r2 0 91 mae 0 20 m and nse 0 90 and c5 input combination rmse 0 29 m r2 0 90 m mae 0 21 and nse 0 89 were little different in the testing period and the gru and knea models also had similar results which indicated that on the basis of the prior gwl and meteorological data adding the irrigation data of the entire district had little improvement on model performance correlations between the estimated gwl values using the lstm gru and knea models and their corresponding observed gwl values in the testing period are shown in fig 6 taking the no 10 monitoring well as an example it could be seen that for the same algorithm the c2 c8 input combinations were closer to the 1 1 line than the c1 input combinations the results of 8 input combinations calculated by the lstm model showed a tendency for underestimation however the results of the c4 and c6 input combinations calculated by the gru model were overestimated compared with the lstm and gru models the gwl calculated by the knea model was closer to the observed value for example the correlation r2 value of the knea model under the c6 input combination was 0 91 higher than that of the corresponding lmst model r2 0 88 or gru model r2 0 85 the patterns found in the scatterplots were consistent with the trends shown in the statistical results of the models in tables 1 and 2 the accuracy of the three models was generally higher when using the complete input combination c3 compared with other incomplete combinations therefore the c3 input combination was selected to evaluate the spatial distribution of rmse in this study overall using the knea model to estimate gwl achieved the minimum rmse of each monitoring well followed by the lstm and gru models fig 7 the rmse value of each monitoring well using the gru model was slightly larger than that using the lstm model in addition the rmse distribution of each monitoring well was relatively uniform for the knea model in the yongji irrigation field however for the lstm and gru models the rmse of the monitoring well in the south was larger than that of the monitoring well in the north 3 2 performance of the models in the yichang irrigation field tables 3 and 4 compare the accuracy of the knea lstm and gru models in estimating the gwl in the yichang irrigation field in the training period the average performances of the c1 c8 input combinations using the knea model rmse 0 41 m r2 0 83 mae 0 27 m and nse 0 82 were better than those using the lstm rmse 0 47 m r2 0 80 mae 0 30 and nse 0 79 and gru rmse 0 48 m r2 0 80 mae 0 30 m and nse 0 79 models but the average performances of the three models had little difference in the testing period the best results were obtained using the c3 input combination for all three models in both the training and testing periods moreover all models provided worse accuracy using the c1 input combination without historical gwl than those using the c2 c8 input combinations with the historical gwl in the training and testing periods tables 3 and 4 which suggests that the historical gwl was very important for the machine model to estimate gwl in the yichang irrigation field for the knea model the statistical results of the c3 input combination rmse 0 32 m r2 0 92 mae 0 21 m and nse 0 92 and c5 input combination rmse 0 33 m r2 0 92 mae 0 22 m and nse 0 92 were slightly different during the testing period in the yichang irrigation field compared with using the c8 and c5 input combinations the rmse r2 mae and nse values of the c5 input combination for the three models increased by 30 6 40 3 9 2 13 1 33 9 43 2 and 13 1 14 2 respectively during the testing period the results were similar to those of the yongji irrigation field which demonstrated that adding meteorological data on the basis of the historical gwl effectively improved the accuracy of the model but adding im had little effect on the accuracy of the model in the yichang irrigation field for the lstm model the statistical results of the c2 and c4 input combinations were better than those of the c6 input combination and the gru and knea models had similar results which indicated that the temperature in the meteorological data was more conducive than the global solar radiation and precipitation to improving the accuracy of the three models in estimating gwl in addition tables 3 and 4 reveal that the knea lstm and gru models were more successful in the yongji irrigation field than in the yichang irrigation field in contrast to the yongji irrigation field the average rmse accuracy of the knea lstm and gru models increased by 25 4 17 9 and 21 7 in the yichang irrigation field during the testing period respectively correlations between the estimated gwl values using the lstm gru and knea models and their corresponding observed gwl values in the testing period are shown in fig 8 from these scatterplots it could be seen that the results using the c2 c8 input combinations were closer to the 1 1 line than those using the c1 input combination r2 0 02 0 11 while the calculated results using the c8 input combination r2 0 81 0 83 were slightly inferior to those using the c2 c7 input combinations r2 0 90 0 92 however the correlations between the estimated gwl values using the lstm gru and knea models and the observed gwl using the c2 c8 input combinations were slightly different and were similar to the statistical results similar to the yongji irrigation field in the yichang irrigation field the c3 input combination was selected to evaluate the spatial distribution of rmse overall the rmse of each monitoring well calculated using the lstm gru and knea models had little difference and the lstm and knea models had a slightly better performance than the gru models fig 9 in addition for the three models the rmse of the monitoring well in the eastern area was larger than that of the monitoring well in the western area moreover the rmses of the three models in the yichang irrigation field were larger than those in the yongji irrigation field for the knea model the rmse distribution of each monitoring well was more uniform in the yongji irrigation field 3 3 cross validation for the yongji and yichang irrigation fields the model established in the yongji irrigation field was used to evaluate the gwl of the yichang irrigation field and the statistical results of model performance are shown in table 5 contrary to the results of the local models better results estimating gwl were achieved using the lstm and gru models and the knea models had the worst performance all three models performed worse under the c1 input combination the results of the c8 input combination were better than those of the c1 input combination which also showed that the influences of the gwl data on the model were greater than those of the meteorological data for the lstm model the statistical results of the c2 c7 combinations had little difference and the performances of the c2 and c3 input combinations were slightly better the best performances of the lstm gru and knea models were with using the c3 input combination rmse 0 31 m r2 0 89 mae 0 22 m and nse 0 85 c4 input combination rmse 0 35 m r2 0 89 mae 0 27 m and nse 0 86 and c7 input combination rmse 0 37 m r2 0 90 mae 0 26 m and nse 0 85 respectively these results indicated that the gwl could be accurately evaluated by inputting the gwl and temperature data in the early stage and adding global solar radiation precipitation and irrigation data had little improvement on model accuracy table 6 shows the statistical results of the model used to evaluate the gwl of the yongji irrigation field based on the model established in the yichang irrigation field the rmse and mae values of the knea model were the largest namely 0 82 m and 0 49 m respectively while the r2 and nse values were the smallest namely 0 56 and 0 35 respectively the performances of the lstm and gru models were better than those of the knea model but there were few differences between them similar to the model established in the yongji irrigation field all three models established in the yichang irrigation field performed poorly under the c1 input combination the lstm gru and knea models performed the best under the c3 c4 and c7 input combinations respectively compared with the yongji irrigation model the yichang irrigation model performed better during the cross test which was supported by the fact that the rmse values of the lstm gru and knea models increased by 24 5 26 5 and 31 0 respectively and the r2 values of the lstm gru and knea models increased by 8 1 1 6 and 20 1 respectively figs 10 and 11 show the correlations between the estimated gwl values sing the lstm gru and knea models and their corresponding observed gwl values in the cross validation for models developed with data from the yongji irrigation field the lstm and gru models performed better than the knea model when applied to the yichang irrigation field fig 10 however the performance of the lstm model showed little difference from the gru model and the lstm model was slightly better than the gru model moreover the gwl values estimated by the knea model were lower than the observed values during the large gwl period similar to the statistical results the model performances using the c2 c7 input combinations were better than those using the c1 and c8 input combinations in the cross validation period figs 10 and 11 in addition it could be seen from the scatterplot figures that when using the model established in the yichang irrigation field to evaluate the gwl in the yongji irrigation field estimated and observed values were closer to the 1 1 line which indicated that the yichang irrigation field model was more suitable for application in the entire region figs 12 and 13 show the rmse spatial distributions of the cross validation of the yongji and yichang irrigation fields overall the rmse values of the lstm and gru models were smaller than that of the knea model which indicated that the lstm and gru models performed better than the knea models in the cross validation period moreover the rmse values of the models established in yichang and applied in the yongji irrigation field were smaller than those of the models established in the yongji irrigation field and applied in the yichang irrigation field in addition the rmse distributions of the yongji irrigation field were relatively uniform and the rmse values of the lstm and gru models were relatively higher in the eastern part of the yichang irrigation field comparing figs 7 and 9 with figs 12 and 13 it can be seen that the rmse values of the cross validation were larger than those of the local validation 4 discussion among the three ml models the knea model had the best performance followed by the lstm and gru algorithms during the training and testing periods in local applications tables 1 and 2 this indicated that the lstm and gru models have some underfitting problems in the training process which affected the overall accuracy of the models the simplification of the gru model relative to the lstm model may have lost some important information undermining the accuracy of the model gao et al 2020 regarding the kernel based algorithm the knea model had a slight advantage in capturing nonlinear relationships however the lstm and gru models performed significantly better than the knea model in the cross application tables 5 and 6 which indicated that the lstm and gru models had stronger general capabilities this showed that the gaussian kernel function was sensitive to inputs when the distributions of external data and local data were different the width of the original gaussian kernel function was no longer suitable for the new data set causing great deviation to the output value dong et al 2019 ma and liu 2018 there have also been similar reports on the results of the differences in the performance between cross station and local application scenarios wang et al 2020 wu et al 2019 from the perspective of model applicability the general ability of a model is more important than the accuracy of local tests rajaee et al 2019 zanotti et al 2019 therefore we recommend the lstm model as the most suitable model for this area in cross validation the model established based on the data of the yichang irrigation field was better than that of the yongji irrigation field this may have been due to the difference in data quality between the two data sets behzad et al 2009 kisi 2015 lu et al 2018 the data noise of the yongji irrigation field was greater making the accuracy of the model inferior to the former therefore for the study area the model established in the yichang irrigation field was recommended as the general model for the entire area the input scenario analysis indicated that the historical gwl was very important for gwl prediction using the knea gru and lstm models similar results were found in the studies by lallahem et al 2005 and mohanty et al 2015 where different input combinations including precipitation evapotranspiration temperature river stage pumping rates etc were employed to predict gwl using the ann model in these studies in addition rajaee et al 2019 reviewed previous studies and found that gwl was the most valuable input variable a historical gwl was used as an input to provide a reference or initial value for the machine learning model to calculate the groundwater level at the next moment then the ml models adjusted the predicted gwl based on other input data therefore the historical gwls were critical input data for predicting the gwls using ml models in most cases the modeling performance of the lstm gru and knea models improved significantly with the inclusion of meteorological data similar results were found in the study by mukherjee and ramachandran 2018 meteorological data affect groundwater through their effects on evaporation and crop water consumption for meteorological data input temperature was more important than gsr and prec in our research one possible explanation for this was that the annual average precipitation in the yichang and yongji irrigation fields was less than 200 mm but the evaporation was nearly 2400 mm li et al 2020 which indicated that the dominant factor affecting fluctuations in gwl was evaporation rather than precipitation as shown in the penman monteith equation there is a significant positive correlation between temperature and evaporation however it was reported in fao56 that et0 can be calculated by using the hargreaves formula under the condition of missing data which only needs temperature as input allen et al 1998 in addition wang et al 2020 evaluated the evaporation of arid regions in northwest china by utilizing three ml models using temperature radiation relative humidity and wind speed as inputs it was found that adding radiation based on temperature input had little effect on the accuracy of the ml models which indicates that temperature may have a greater impact on evaporation than radiation moreover it is very difficult to obtain detailed radiation data and the cost is too high to bear for developing countries however temperature acquisition is relatively simple which greatly increases the possibility of using ml models to predict groundwater levels in developing countries in addition adding irrigation data to the models had little effect on the accuracy of gwl evaluation using historical gwls and meteorological data input in advance however sahoo et al 2017a found that irrigation was an important parameter for machine learning models to estimate groundwater in agricultural areas in the united states in their model the irrigation input was obtained by using the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat model in lieu of unavailable groundwater pumping records in our research irrigation water was almost diverted from the yellow river in the yichang and yongji irrigation districts diversion irrigation may have a much smaller impact on local groundwater levels than pumping groundwater for irrigation in addition the local government has invested for decades considerable manpower and material resources in the implementation of water saving irrigation the impact of irrigation on the groundwater level has gradually weakened as the amount of irrigation has decreased another possible reason for this was that the irrigation data provided in this study were the average values of the irrigation area and we had no precise irrigation data for each groundwater well therefore the average input of irrigation data might also have resulted in a weak relationship between irrigation and gwl however according to the driving force theory of groundwater movement water diversion from rivers for irrigation and groundwater extraction for irrigation significantly affect the dynamics of the gwl wang et al 2014 therefore to predict the groundwater level more accurately by using ml models more precise irrigation data are required overall we have fully evaluated the performance of the three models to predict gwl using limited data and have achieved relatively ideal and applicable results in the hetao irrigation district in addition the inputs of this study did not include many factors that affect the change in gwl such as topography soil texture and groundwater extraction moreover the locations of the two study areas are adjacent therefore the study results may not be applicable to areas with large differences in climate or soil texture therefore the next step in this study is to further verify these ml algorithms in other regions and to consider introducing remote sensing information as input including vegetation cover and actual evapotranspiration 5 conclusions in this study the performances prediction accuracy and model stability of the knea lstm and gru models for gwl estimation were compared by conducting local and cross applications these models were fed monthly data from 1990 to 2015 from two subirrigated areas in the hetao irrigation district in china eight different input combinations and four statistical indicators rmse r2 mae and nse were used for model evaluation for the local application the knea model was superior to the lstm and gru models for all input combinations for cross district applications the average statistical results indicated that the lstm and gru models performed better than the knea model and the lstm model achieved the highest accuracy and stability comprehensively considering the prediction accuracy and general ability the lstm model was recommended for monthly gwl prediction in the hetao irrigation district in addition the model established based on the data from the yichang irrigation field was better than that from the yongji irrigation field for the input data the historical groundwater level was an indispensable input for the machine learning models to accurately predict the groundwater level adding meteorological data on the basis of the historical groundwater level greatly improved the accuracy of the model compared with prec and gsr adding temperature input had the best improvement adding large scale average irrigation data did not significantly improve the accuracy of the model therefore adding easy to obtain temperature data can be used as a method to improve the accuracy of ml models for estimating gwl which provides great help for the application of ml in agricultural areas with limited data furthermore the influence of historical gwls and temperature on estimating gwl by using the knea lstm and gru models was greater than that of precipitation global solar radiation and the large scale average amount of irrigation in addition the model established based on the data from the yichang irrigation field was better than that from the yongji irrigation field therefore the model established in the yichang irrigation field was recommended as the general model for the entire study area declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10003,nitrogen pollution from paddy fields is a main contributor to global non point source nps pollution and greatly increases the risks of surface water eutrophication and groundwater contamination this study assesses the comprehensive transport and transformation of water and nitrogen ttwn for a 4 year irrigation and urea application in the paddy field using 6 water balance components and 12 nitrogen inputs and outputs the results show that alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation reduces water and nitrogen for irrigation drainage and leaching but has a minor effect on rice evapotranspiration etc urea application and mineralization are the most important nitrogen inputs to the paddy field accounting for 58 7 68 2 and 23 7 35 0 of nitrogen input respectively rice plant uptake ammonia volatilization av and nitrification denitrification account for 68 0 75 0 11 9 17 1 and 5 1 9 3 of nitrogen output respectively nitrogen leaching 3 5 11 5 kg ha 1 is also large while the observed depth of leaching needs to be further investigated meanwhile nitrogen drainage 0 72 1 11 kg ha 1 is not as large as conventionally accepted awd affects the nitrogen accumulation and release of duckweed which is one of the potential reasons for the increase in rice yields in the course of four continuous rice seasons the soil nitrogen content snc of the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers continued to decrease and increase respectively and the overall nitrogen content did not change significantly irrigation modes and fertilization splits may promote or inhibit av and it depended on the time when urea was applied in addition awd and three fertilization splits significantly promote nitrification denitrification and nitrogen uptake by rice this study presents a theoretical basis for nps pollution reduction and provides an important framework for establishing an accurate model of ttwn for paddy fields keywords alternate wetting and drying non point source pollution nitrogen input and output nitrogen decomposition denitrification 1 introduction agricultural irrigation utilizes approximately 72 of the world s water consumption moya et al 2004 in asia more than 90 of irrigation water is used for rice cultivation maeda et al 2011 rice cultivation consumes approximately 21 25 of the global nitrogen fertilizer requirement chauhan et al 2017 while urea is the most commonly used nitrogen fertilizer in paddy fields heffer and prud homme 2011 unfortunately excessive amounts of nitrogen fertilizers are being used in paddy fields deng et al 2011 typically rice cultivation uses flooding irrigation fi zhao et al 2012b grisp global rice science partnership 2013 han et al 2019b and the rice growing period is synchronized with the rainy season kumwimba et al 2018 there is therefore a big concern on the environmental impacts of inefficient irrigation modes and high nitrogen loads zhu et al 2006 ttwn is controlled by the comprehensive regulation of irrigation modes and fertilization regimes impacts the environment significantly based on many years of experimental research and practice water saving irrigation wsi which is now widely adopted by farmers mao 2002 belder et al 2004 dong et al 2012 sun et al 2012 ye et al 2013 lahue et al 2016 xu et al 2017 islam et al 2018 has significantly altered the water transport process and has been proven effective in saving water akter et al 2018 zhuang et al 2019 although the fertilization regime has a major influence on water movement it is mainly reflected in transpiration and the more fertilization the greater the transpiration cui et al 2004 studies have shown that wsi improves rainfall utilization inthavong et al 2011 sriphirom et al 2019 reduces the nitrogen taken by irrigation and increases the wet nitrogen utilization brought by rainfall kyaw et al 2005 liu et al 2011 however nitrogen brought by rainfall contributes to nps pollution and is random and uncontrollable researchers have been mainly concerned with the effects of nitrogen drainage and leaching on nps pollution from paddy fields belder et al 2005 yoshinaga et al 2007 cho et al 2008 yang et al 2015 wang et al 2014a fortunately wsi could significantly reduce nitrogen drainage and leaching mao 2002 however the two gaseous nitrogen transport processes av and denitrification are not easily detectable these two processes are also important factors in the nitrogen output of paddy fields wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 in china the annual av is estimated to be 2 80 3 55 tg zhang et al 2017 and the annual n2o loss is up to 138 154 gg in paddy fields liang et al 2013 it has also been determined that av and denitrification were stronger with the increase in fertilizer application xu et al 2012 yu et al 2015 bosch serra et al 2014 turner et al 2012 however the effect of wsi on av is still under debate peng et al 2009 yang et al 2012 and xu et al 2012 report that wsi inhibits av while cui et al 2004 yu et al 2015 and zhao et al 2010 suggest that wsi promotes av on the other hand wsi promoted denitrification in most cases especially in the process of soil water content swc change liu et al 2014 katayanagi et al 2012 wang et al 2018 in addition to wsi reducing nitrogen application can also directly reduce nitrogen drainage and leaching av and denitrification however the appropriate amount of nitrogen applied to paddy fields requires further research ata ul karim et al 2017 studies have shown that the nitrogen concentration in surface water remains high within 7 days after fertilization wang et al 2016 hua et al 2019 therefore increasing the fertilization splits lowering the nitrogen concentration of surface water after fertilization and reducing the risk of nitrogen drainage caused by rainfall are effective measures for reducing nps pollution mao 2002 gao et al 2009 second the amount of rainfall accumulated in paddy fields can be controlled by moderately lowering the surface water depth during the fertilization period thereby reducing nitrogen drainage cao et al 2019 however the effectiveness of this measure in reducing av and denitrification load is uncertain the nitrogen application rate of paddy fields and nitrogen uptake by rice plants are high while the characteristics of nitrogen uptake by rice remain unclear researchers have suggested that nitrogen uptake by rice is the product of nitrogen concentration in the root zone and transpiration chowdary et al 2004 however there are two issues that need to be resolved 1 accurately calculating the nitrogen concentration in the root zone that could be absorbed by rice and 2 sometimes there was no solution in the root zone under wsi when the paddy field was in moderate drying or field sunning during late tillering stage in addition only 20 30 of nitrogen fertilizer was absorbed by rice cui et al 2004 and the rest of the nitrogen requirement was mostly provided by organic nitrogen mineralization lehrsch et al 2016 in general wsi and nitrogen application promoted mineralization mohanty et al 2013 xu et al 2020 however zhao et al 2012a 2012b believed that fertilization inhibited the rate of soil mineralization microbial nitrogen fixation also provides some nitrogen for rice growing liu et al 2018 but it was difficult to observe this process liu et al 2014 during the growing stages rice is also subjected to competition from duckweed however duckweeds decay quickly and release a large amount of nitrogen after a drought li et al 2019 under wsi duckweed alternated between growing and decay playing a role in regulating water and nitrogen transport this regulatory role needs to be further studied various ttwn processes in paddy fields are complex and very difficult to analyze and evaluate simultaneously antonopoulos 2010 most researchers have focused only on observations of either a single or several obvious nitrogen pathways such as drainage leaching av and denitrification etc from either small plots or monolith lysimeters zhao et al 2012a chen et al 2014 hua et al 2019 maruyama et al 2008 chowdary et al 2004 hitomi et al 2010 fu et al 2019 these may fail to identify the comprehensive ttwn processes under specific climatic conditions and years of continuous cropping in the study area yang et al 2015 therefore in this study we conducted a 4 year plot experiment to study the ttwn under the couplings of different irrigation modes and urea application regimes in paddy fields from 2016 to 2019 the specific objectives of this study are 1 to comprehensively analyze ttwn processes and 2 to evaluate the environmental effects and sustainability of different irrigation modes and urea application regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and plot layout the experiment was conducted in rice plots of the dali comprehensive environmental monitoring station 100 07 43 e 25 49 59 n altitude 1975 m erhai irrigation district yunnan province china the monitoring station is located in the low latitude plateau the annual average temperature is 15 1 the annual average rainfall is 1041 mm and 85 96 of the rainfall is concentrated in may to october and an average annual sunshine of 2439 h in the recent 15 years soil bulk density is 1 24 g cm 3 volume saturated water content is 55 and volume field water holding rate is 47 2 the soil is silty loam with an average particle size of 19 26 µm at the start of the field experiment the initial soil total nitrogen tn total phosphorus total potassium nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n were 4 1 g kg 1 1 56 g kg 1 15 4 g kg 1 4 2 mg kg 1 and 5 88 mg kg 1 respectively each plot covers an area of 54 m2 12 m in length and 4 5 m in width and plots are separated by a ridge covered with plastic film the plastic film had a buried depth of 40 cm to prevent water inrush and lateral seepage the height and width of the ridge were both 40 cm irrigation water was supplied to each plot through pipes and a water meter was installed at the water outlet of each pipe a water gauge hobo water depth gauge and seepage measuring cylinder were installed in each plot each plot was divided into three depths to install leaching solution extractors 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm below the ground surface fig 1 2 2 treatment design the field experiment covered four consecutive rice seasons from 2016 to 2019 and there were two irrigation modes fi and awd the specific water depth control standard is shown in table 1 there were two nitrogen application levels n0 193 kg ha 1 traditional nitrogen application amount of the erhai irrigation district calculated by pure nitrogen and n1 135 kg ha 1 70 of the n0 two nitrogen split applications f2 tiller fertilizer tf panicle fertilizer pf 7 3 and f3 base fertilizer bf tf pf 5 3 2 the above conditions were combined into eight treatments and each treatment was set with three repetitions the total number of plots was 24 and each plot was randomly arranged urea was applied to all plots and both phosphorus 65 kg ha 1 and potassium 65 kg ha 1 fertilizers were applied to the paddy field with the base fertilizer during the planting process of the four rice years middle season rice was planted and the communities where the treatments were located remained unchanged 2 3 observation contents and methods the ttwn in paddy fields involves 6 water balance elements rainfall irrigation drainage leaching etc and swc change and 12 nitrogen inputs and outputs urea hydrolyzation wet nitrogen deposition soil organic nitrogen mineralization microbial nitrogen fixation nitrogen brought by irrigation nitrogen drainage nitrogen leaching av denitrification rice plant uptake duckweed uptake and release and snc change elements links and processes of ttwn and their corresponding observation equipment and instruments were showed in fig 1 2 3 1 water balance elements 1 irrigation was measured by the water meter installed in each community and converted into the water depth per unit area 2 drainage was calculated according to the difference between the field water depth before and after drainage 3 water depth was observed by a water gauge and a self recording water level gauge at 8 00 a m every day 4 leaching was observed daily by a thin walled seepage measuring cylinder installed at the bottom of the plow without disturbing the field covered to prevent rain and direct sunlight 5 etc was measured based on the daily field water consumption minus daily leaching 6 rainfall was measured by an automatic weather station installed in the station 7 swc was monitored hourly by an em50 soil water sensor during rice growing stages 2 3 2 nitrogen transport and transformation 1 changes of field surface water nitrogen concentration after fertilization surface water samples were taken every day from the first to the third day and then every other day for 9 days followed by every 3 days and every 7 days until the end of the test 2 nitrogen drainage rainfall exceeding the limit of field rainfall was drained and collected and the volume and nitrogen concentration of these drainages were observed the nitrogen drainage loss caused by one rainfall event was the product of the drainage volume and nitrogen concentration 3 nitrogen leaching in order to explore the change in nitrogen in the vertical direction of soil water leaching solution extractors were installed at three depths 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm in each community to sample the leaching solution the sampling time was the same as that of the field water linear interpolation was used to estimate the nitrogen concentration which was not observed 4 wet nitrogen deposition three rain collection samplers were set in the test station with an interval of 300 m collection samplers were emptied after each collection and periodically cleared especially when it was to rain http www mee gov cn ywgz fgbz bz bzwb jcffbz shtml the product of nitrogen concentration and rainfall in a single rainfall event was the wet deposition of nitrogen 5 nitrogen brought by irrigation water samples were taken at the early middle and late stages of irrigation to observe the nitrogen concentration in irrigation water the product of average nitrogen concentration and the irrigation amount was the amount of nitrogen brought into the field by irrigation 6 soil organic nitrogen mineralization two cultivation methods were evaluated for soil organic nitrogen mineralization flooding cultivation fc and alternate wetting and drying cultivation ac mikha et al 2005 these two methods correspond to the mineralization characteristics of paddy soil under fi and awd respectively at each growing stage of rice fresh soil samples were collected from field plots and loaded into mineralized tubes and the tubes containing soil samples were buried into the field for in situ culture each buried mineralized tube was taken out when mineralized tubes of the next growing stage buried for cultivation and brought back to the laboratory for leaching to observe the concentration of ammonia nitrogen li et al 2019 7 av the observation and calculation of the daily av load were observed using the improved ventilation method designed by xu et al 2012 pvc collectors 20 cm in height with phosphoglycerol soaked sponges were used fig 1 inside each tube has two sponges the upper one to trap ammonia from the air and the lower one to capture ammonia volatilized from the paddy field the samples collected in the phosphoglycerol soaked sponge from the plots by the pvc collectors were immediately immersed in 300 ml of 1 0 mol l 1 kcl solution in 500 ml containers and were shaken by a reciprocating shaker before the extracted solutions were analyzed the sampling time was consistent with the field water sampling the av rate of field soil was calculated using eq 1 1 r av 10 2 m a d where r av is the av rate kg ha 1 d 1 m is the daily ammonia collected by the pvc collector mg d 1 a is the cross sectional area of the pvc collector m2 8 denitrification static chamber gas was used to observe the field n2o emission rate wu and zhang 2014 the size of the sampling box was 80 cm 80 cm 110 cm later add layer and was fixed at a point and the box was wrapped with sponge and glass fiber aluminum foil cloth to prevent excessive temperature changes in the box due to sun exposure there was a fan in the box to make the gas mixed evenly fig 1 when collecting gas the sampling box was buckled vertically in the groove of the base and water was added to seal it to prevent gas leakage after buckling the box a 50 ml syringe was used to extract the gas at 0 10 20 and 30 min the rate of n2o emission is derived from the rate of change of the gas concentration over time the calculation formulas are 2 f ρ v a d c d t 273 273 t 3 c i 1

the number of days between consecutive two samplings d 9 snc before transplanting and after harvest soil samples from three depths 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 40 cm were taken from each plot 10 nitrogen fixation by microbes the denitrification decomposition dndc model li 2000 was used to simulate the amount of microbial nitrogen fixation in paddy fields under fi and awd and to analyze the amount and process of nitrogen fixation 11 nitrogen uptake by rice plants rice plant samples were taken during each growing stage and the daily rice dry matter quality curve was plotted by measuring the dry matter quality using the drying method then the total nitrogen content of the rice plants and the daily total nitrogen content were plotted the nitrogen accumulation in rice is the product of the daily dry matter mass and the daily nitrogen content the difference in nitrogen accumulation between two adjacent days is the daily rice nitrogen uptake 12 nitrogen uptake and release of duckweed an experiment on the growing characteristics of duckweed under different water treatments was designed indoors to avoid rain there were three treatments continuous flooding cf where there was always a water layer on the surface of the paddy field moderate drought md when the swc decreased to 80 θ s and severe drought sd when the swc decreased to 70 θ s before re watering the cf treatment mainly observed the natural mortality of duckweed md and sd were used to observe the decay and death of duckweed under different drought conditions in paddy fields and the growing characteristics after re watering each treatment had 3 repetitions with a total of 9 incubators the concentrations of tn nh4 n and no3 n in water samples were measured by alkaline potassium persulfate uv spectrophotometry naismith s reagent uv spectrophotometry and hydrochloric acid acidification uv spectrophotometry respectively the tn content in plants and soil was determined by the kjeldahl method n2o was determined by gas chromatograph bao 2000 3 results and analysis 3 1 change of water balance elements change of daily water balance elements under different treatments were observed during the rice growing stages in 2016 2019 fin0f2 farmers traditional water and urea mode and awdn1f3 potentially recommended water and urea mode of 2016 2019 were chosen to illustrate the accumulation process of water balance elements fig 2 there was always a certain water depth under fi except for the sun drying during the later tillering stage and the natural falling dry during the yellow maturity stage table 1 however the swc dropped below saturation many times under awd fig 2 this also led to differences in percolation the percolations were 137 2 205 8 mm under awdn1f3 and 173 6 230 1 mm under fin0f2 in 2016 2019 respectively etc were 466 0 518 8 mm under awdn1f3 and 484 6 539 5 mm under fin0f2 respectively and the average annual etc under awd was approximately 20 mm less than that under fi the irrigation water were 68 1 mm 70 0 mm 103 8 mm and 66 3 mm under awdn1f3 and 150 8 mm 155 9 mm 230 2 mm and 204 5 mm under fin0f2 in 2016 2019 respectively simultaneously the drainage water were 210 3 mm 189 7 mm 30 4 mm and 33 7 mm under awdn1f3 and 200 5 mm 273 7 mm 71 5 mm and 120 mm under fin0f2 respectively it showed that the amount of irrigation water under awd was significantly less than that under fi however the drainage water under awd was not always less than that under fi in addition the rainfall were 772 4 mm 764 3 mm 497 1 mm and 502 6 mm in 2016 2019 rice seasons respectively in general there was sufficient rainfall in 2016 and 2017 rice seasons while insufficient rainfall in 2018 and 2019 rice seasons 3 2 transport and transformation of nitrogen 3 2 1 nitrogen input by wet deposition mineralization irrigation and bio fixation daily rainfall and wet nitrogen deposition concentrations in 2016 2019 were monitored most of the wet nitrogen deposition concentrations were 0 90 5 85 mg l 1 and the nitrogen concentration in 2017 was generally higher than that in 2016 fig 3 the average rainfall per time in 2016 rice season was 45 1 mm while that in 2017 was 22 0 mm only half of that in 2016 the wet nitrogen deposition in 2016 and 2017 rice seasons were 13 2 and 16 3 kg ha 1 accounting for 8 5 and 12 1 of urea application respectively it was very close to the average value 16 12 kg ha 1 of a ten year monitoring experiment in southeast china by cui et al 2014 however it was higher than the value obtained by tan et al 2015 less than 4 kg ha 1 and only 50 of what xu et al 2018 obtained in the yangtze river basin most studies have shown that the wet nitrogen deposition fluxes in most areas were significantly greater than the global average of 3 5 kg ha 1 phoenix et al 2006 it means a large amount of nitrogen enters the environmental water by wet nitrogen deposition which is a stable nitrogen source for rice and other ecosystems he et al 2011 the cumulative nitrogen mineralization increased gradually with the cultivation progress while the mineralization amount per unit time will gradually decrease fig 4 and it was approximately 70 kg ha 1 over the whole growing period of rice and was 3 kg ha 1 more under ac than that under fc mineralization accumulation was 63 5 kg ha 1 after 60 day cultivation under fc accounting for 90 of the total mineralization compared with fc mineralization decreased by approximately 3 5 kg ha 1 after the first dry incubation under ac the mineralization results were consistent with results jyotiprava dash et al 2015 observed it was approximately 21 0 kg ha 1 less than what antonopoulos 2010 observed and 16 8 kg ha 1 more than what tan et al 2015 observed in addition the average mineralization under ac was higher than that under fc which was the same as in previous research mikha et al 2005 lu et al 2020 the observed nitrogen concentration in the irrigation water ranged from 0 27 to 6 37 mg l 1 average of 2 33 mg l 1 during the four rice seasons and average nitrogen input by irrigation were 3 65 2 78 4 11 and 2 73 kg ha 1 in 2016 2019 rice seasons respectively the nitrogen input by bio fixation under different treatments was 0 5 1 2 kg ha 1 and their absolute and relative quantities were small 3 2 2 change of nitrogen concentration in surface water and leaching water the nh4 n concentration in surface water under different treatments peaked on the 1st 2nd day after fertilization decreased rapidly after and then further decreased to a low level after 7 days of fertilization fig 5 the change of no3 n concentration in surface water was the same as nh4 n however the peaks of no3 n concentration were significantly delayed approximately 3 5 days later than that of nh4 n because urea hydrolysis and nitration nh4 ion converts to no3 ion required longer time saggar et al 2013 this was also why some researchers thought that nh4 n was the main monitoring factor in surface water in the early stage of fertilization and that no3 n was the main factor in the later stage wang et al 2003 the nitrogen concentration of leaching water at different depths showed an upward trend initially before decreasing fig 6 and an obvious decrease with increasing depth at the late rice growing stages and their peak values generally appeared around the 7th day after urea application the nitrogen concentration fluctuated around 4 mg l 1 at a depth of 20 cm in most cases remained around 4 mg l 1 in the early rice growing stage and dropped to 1 2 mg l 1 in the late stage at a depth of 40 cm and it fluctuated around 3 mg l 1 in the early rice growing stage and then decreased to 0 1 mg l 1 in the late stage at a depth of 60 cm on the whole the nitrogen concentration of leaching water had a small change at 0 40 cm depth during early rice growing stage and decreased at the 40 60 cm depth 3 2 3 nitrogen losses with water flow via drainage and leaching the nitrogen drainage under different treatments in 2016 2019 were 1 11 0 91 0 72 and 0 92 kg ha 1 respectively table 2 and the average nitrogen drainage was 0 91 kg ha 1 in 2016 2019 accounting for 0 56 of the average urea application the average nitrogen drainage was 0 02 kg ha 1 and 1 8 less under awd 1 1 kg ha 1 than that under fi 1 12 kg ha 1 0 2 kg ha 1 and 16 5 less under n1 1 01 kg ha 1 than that under n0 1 21 kg ha 1 0 07 kg ha 1 and 6 1 less under f3 1 07 kg ha 1 than that under f2 1 14 kg ha 1 it can be seen that awd n1 and f3 can reduce nitrogen drainage because the ridges of all plots were covered with plastic film and the plastic film had a buried depth of 40 cm nitrogen transport over 40 cm depth was defined as nitrogen leaching in 2016 2017 the nitrogen leaching at 40 cm depth were 5 75 and 8 9 kg ha 1 accounting for 3 5 and 5 4 of the urea application respectively fig 7 the average nitrogen leaching was 1 77 kg ha 1 and 21 6 less under awd 6 44 kg ha 1 than that under fi 8 21 kg ha 1 1 44 kg ha 1 and 17 9 less under n1 6 61 kg ha 1 than that under n0 8 05 kg ha 1 1 32 kg ha 1 and 16 5 more under f3 7 99 kg ha 1 than that under f2 6 67 kg ha 1 in conclusion both awd and n1 reduced nitrogen leaching while f3 increased nitrogen leaching to a certain extent nitrogen drainage and nitrogen leaching have been compared in previous studies yoshinaga et al 2007 cho et al 2008 in this study the average nitrogen drainage and nitrogen leaching were 1 16 and 6 99 kg ha 1 respectively nitrogen leaching was 6 times that of nitrogen drainage 3 2 4 gaseous nitrogen losses via av and nitrification denitrification the av rate increased rapidly after each fertilization and then decreased rapidly fig 8 1 3 days after fertilization was the key period for av av lasted for 7 9 days after application of bf and tf and lasted for 5 days after application of pf compared with bf and tf the peak value of av after pf application was smaller av accounted for 14 2 19 1 of urea application the average av was 3 3 kg ha 1 and 12 7 less under awd 22 7 kg ha 1 than that under fi 26 0 kg ha 1 7 8 kg ha 1 and 27 6 less under n1 20 5 kg ha 1 than that under n0 28 3 kg ha 1 5 6 kg ha 1 and 25 9 more under f3 27 2 kg ha 1 than that under f2 21 6 kg ha 1 awd reduced av n1 considerably reduced av and f3 considerably increased av the treatment with the lowest and largest av loss were w1n1f2 and w0n0f3 respectively this result was consistent with that of many researchers xu et al 2012 cao et al 2013 and smaller than wang et al 2018 reviewed av not only caused nitrogen losses but more importantly it increased the nitrogen concentration in wet deposition and exacerbated the formation of nps scudlark et al 2005 intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc et al 2006 wu et al 2016 the n2o fluxes were significantly affected by urea application and water management which increased immediately either through fertilization or swc change fig 9 and they decreased rapidly after fertilization and were lower in the late rice growing stage in addition n2o fluxes were not significantly different over a long period of flooding the cumulative n2o emissions was 0 48 kg ha 1 and 54 0 less under awd 1 37 kg ha 1 than that under fi 0 89 kg ha 1 which were close to the nitrogen drainage and equivalent to approximately 10 of av this result was similar to the 1 00 kg ha 1 cumulative n2o emissions bhattacharyya et al 2012 obtained and within 1 77 0 86 kg ha 1 measured by hao et al 2016 the conclusion that awd significantly promoted denitrification was the same as hwang and hanaki 2000 liu et al 2014 tan et al 2015 and liao et al 2020 although the denitrification load was relatively small its greenhouse effect was very significant so denitrification needed to be inhibited wu and zhang 2014 this was also a large negative impact of awd and other wsi modes on rice cultivation 3 2 5 nitrogen uptake by rice the dry matter mass of rice increased almost linearly and the growth rate was approximately 0 1 t ha 1 d 1 it varied from 11 4 to 13 5 t ha 1 under different treatments at harvest time and there was no significant difference between the two rice seasons fig 10 the nitrogen content of rice plants remained unchanged at first and then decreased continuously with the maximum at the late tillering stage and the minimum at the yellow ripening stage fig 11a nitrogen content increased slightly at the heading flowering stage which may be related to the pf application li 2016 the nitrogen content of rice continued to decrease when the leaves began to block each other ata ul karim et al 2017 the nitrogen uptake by rice was observed during the entire growing period in 2017 rice season it increased and then decreased reaching a peak approximately 90 days after transplanting with an average growing rate of 1 4 kg ha 1 d 1 and then decreased to the average nitrogen uptake of 113 3 kg ha 1 at harvest time at a rate of 0 3 kg ha 1 d 1 fig 11b this was similar to the reported values of antonopoulos 2010 belder et al 2005 and tan et al 2015 it was slightly higher under awd than that under fi which was the same as tan et al 2015 obtained however dong et al 2012 found it was 13 6 more under awd than that under fi 3 2 6 nitrogen release and uptake by duckweed duckweed dry matter and nitrogen content both continuously decreased with growing under cf they also decreased continuously with the swc decrease under md and sd fig 12 and the daily average natural mortality rate of duckweed was 1 5 dry matter were 34 5 and 9 9 kg ha 1 when swc reached 80 θ s and 70 θ s respectively the corresponding dry matter maxima were 51 2 and 15 4 kg ha 1 after re watering however it can be seen that not all duckweed regenerated after re watering and the excessive drought caused most of the duckweed to wither and die duckweed nitrogen content was close to 3 0 fig 12c which was higher than that in some wetland plants han et al 2019a including paddy rice fig 11 they were 2 65 and 2 48 when the swc reached 80 θ s and 70 θ s respectively after re watering duckweed regenerated and the nitrogen content rose to 2 74 and 2 5 at the end of the experiment 3 2 7 change of snc the snc continuously decreased at 0 20 cm depth and increased at 20 40 cm depth in the rice seasons of 2016 2018 and it increased after rice harvest compared with that before transplanting and the difference in snc between each soil layer was reduced at 0 40 cm depth in the 2019 rice season fig 13 after four rice seasons the average snc under awd and fi decreased by 13 5 and 15 1 at the 0 10 cm layer respectively and they decreased by 1 7 and 1 2 at the 10 20 cm layer respectively however they increased by 16 0 and 16 7 at the 20 40 cm layer respectively the decrease in snc was mainly caused by nitrogen drainage nitrogen leaching and av at the 0 20 cm layer gao et al 2005 the snc at the 20 40 cm layer continued to increase because this layer was dense and could absorb the leached nitrogen zhao et al 2012a further analysis showed that the variation of snc at different depths under n1 and f3 were consistent with that under awd in conclusion awd n1 and f3 increased the soil nitrogen inventory reduced urea loss and decreased nitrogen loss compared with fi n0 and f2 respectively 3 3 nitrogen input and output fig 14 presents the nitrogen inputs and outputs of the rice season in 2017 nitrogen inputs and outputs were 216 6 295 9 kg ha 1 and 160 5 212 8 kg ha 1 respectively nitrogen surpluses were 44 2 56 1 kg ha 1 under n1 and 82 9 95 6 kg ha 1 under n0 respectively and the surplus nitrogen was stored in the plow pan 20 40 cm or more deep soil layer fig 13 under n1 the urea applied amount 135 0 kg ha 1 was less than the nitrogen output which required mineralization wet nitrogen deposition and irrigation to bring in part of the nitrogen for rice growing under n0 the fertilizer application amount 193 0 kg ha 1 was close to the nitrogen output in paddy fields the urea application was the main source of nitrogen input accounting for 58 7 68 2 of nitrogen input and the proportions had no significant difference under awd and fi however the effect of organic nitrogen mineralization was also obvious which accounted 23 7 35 0 of nitrogen input in terms of nitrogen output rice plant uptake accounted for 68 0 75 0 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different irrigation modes and urea application regimes on nitrogen input 4 1 1 mineralization compared with the urea application the nitrogen input by mineralization was also large cui et al 2004 found that nitrogen uptake by rice only accounted for 20 0 30 0 of the nitrogen fertilizer applied using isotope tracer tests and nitrogen uptake mainly came from mineralization the difference in mineralization between different treatments was not significant which might be related to the fact that the indoor simulation cannot reflect the real environment of the paddy field lehrsch et al 2016 the indoor flooded culture method in our study is widely used because of its simplicity and better reproducibility of results song et al 2017 simultaneously it was difficult to simulate the impact of natural conditions and farmland management patterns on the soil environment lehrsch et al 2016 however mikha et al 2005 and yemadje et al 2017 found the flush of mineralized nitrogen seemed to be mostly microbial in origin and unaffected by alternate wetting and drying of soil other studies suggested that the mineralization was affected by the amount of nitrogen application the higher the amount of nitrogen application the greater the amount of mineralization presenting a priming effect kuzyakov 2010 the main reason was that applied nitrogen occupied and supplemented the position of mineralized nitrogen and the mineralized nitrogen actually ultimately came from nitrogen application in combination with fig 13 this result seems to be reasonable as the total nitrogen content of paddy soil barely changed after four rice seasons when the accumulation of mineral nitrogen in the soil exceeds the requirement for rice growing nitrogen will leach into the groundwater and cause water pollution zhang et al 2012 although researchers have paid more attention to water pollution caused by nitrogen leaching in paddy fields mao 2002 cui et al 2017 there is insufficient understanding of water pollution caused by mineralization the assessment of the contribution of mineralization to water pollution is inaccurate zhang et al 2012 in addition mineralization also affects the assessment of nitrogen leaching making it difficult to accurately calculate nitrogen leaching from fertilization 4 1 2 wet nitrogen deposition among all the nitrogen inputs and outputs in paddy fields wet nitrogen deposition is the only process that is not affected by irrigation mode and urea application regime besides wet nitrogen deposition had a high nitrogen concentration fig 3 which was more frequent and widely distributed than fertilization and more conducive for the uptake and utilization by rice ishii et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 however we should be soberly aware that a large amount of nitrogen enters the environmental water through wet nitrogen deposition causing water pollution and eutrophication he et al 2011 not just a stable nitrogen input in paddy fields 4 1 3 irrigation compared with wet nitrogen deposition the amount of nitrogen input by irrigation was relatively small under different irrigation modes especially awd because irrigation water was from the reservoir and had low nitrogen content however it is common to irrigate paddy fields with multiple water sources and return flow now wu et al 2019a 2019b the nitrogen content in these water sources was generally higher than that in reservoirs and the effect of these water sources on the nitrogen transport in paddy fields have to be studied further 4 2 effects of different irrigation modes and urea application regimes on nitrogen output 4 2 1 drainage drainage is an important way of nitrogen loss from paddy fields in the conventional understanding cho et al 2008 however nitrogen loss via drainage were not too much under different irrigation modes and urea application regimes which were less than that input by irrigation fig 13 the main reasons are as follows 1 the nitrogen concentration in surface water was relatively large within 7 days after fertilization fig 5 more nitrogen was drained if rainfall caused drainage during this period in our study the drainage date in each rice season was not frequent within 7 days after fertilization 2 the surface water depth during fertilization was controlled at approximately 30 mm table 1 which neither affected urea hydrolysis nor caused nitrogen drainage due to sudden rainfall at the same time the limit water depth after rainfall was set at 80 mm table 1 and the probability that the surface water depth exceeded this standard due to a single rainfall was low which ensured that most of the rainfall was stored in the plot avoiding drainage and improving the rainfall utilization rate 3 increasing the fertilization splits and reducing the amount of fertilizer applied reduced the nitrogen concentration level of surface water and the risk of nitrogen drainage after fertilization and increased the nitrogen utilization in the late growing stage of rice the study by cui et al 2001 showed that bf tf jointing booting fertilization heading flowering fertilization 3 3 3 1 was a high efficiency technical measure for fertilizer utilization in paddy fields however this might increase the labor cost and the f3 proposed in this paper may be a better choice 4 2 2 leaching drainage occurs accidentally due to excessive rainfall while leaching continues in paddy fields for nitrogen leaching in paddy fields a wide range of values has been reported by different studies zhao et al 2012a wang et al 2014b in addition to differences in soil texture water and fertilizer patterns chowdary et al 2004 song et al 2005 aparicio et al 2008 constantin et al 2010 hansen et al 2010 xiong et al 2010 hitomi et al 2010 nitrogen leaching observation has always been difficult there is no consensus on what depth can leached nitrogen be considered as nitrogen leaching in the paddy field zhao et al 2012a tian et al 2007 the final results obtained by using different depths as observation points of leaching loss are different and not all leached nitrogen enters the external water body in this study three depths of leaching samplers were set up to explore the vertical law of leaching loss fig 1 considering that the water barrier of the ridge membrane between the plots was 40 cm it would be affected by groundwater beyond this depth nitrogen leaching was calculated at a depth of 40 cm which might be different from the actual situation therefore a standard observation and calculation method for nitrogen leaching was expected to be found on a regional scale for the comparison of results in rice paddies and the evaluation of nitrogen leaching into groundwater zhao et al 2012a 4 2 3 av av losses was more than nitrogen drainage and leaching which obtained more and more attention however the effect of irrigation modes and fertilization regimes on av is still under debate xu et al 2015 pan et al 2016 in this study nh4 n penetrated the soil more effectively during the downward movement of water under awd and more nh4 n was adsorbed by soil colloids reducing the probability of av zaman et al 2013 when there were continuous water layers in the fields under different irrigation modes before fertilization due to rainfall awd did not reduce the av xu et al 2015 compared with f2 f3 increased the base fertilizer at this time the nitrogen uptake and leaf area index of rice were both small leading to large av with the same amount of fertilizer av was much lower at the later rice growing stage fig 7 therefore whether awd and increasing urea splits promote or inhibit av depends on the time when urea was applied chen et al 2020 factors affecting the av rate include ph meteorological factors planting structure and national policies hayashi et al 2008 huang et al 2012 wang et al 2018 after comparative analysis with multiple factors it was found that av had a great relationship with the nh4 n concentration of the field surface water from a comparison of figs 5 and 8 it can also be seen that the nh4 n concentration and the av rate are highly consistent 4 2 4 release and uptake by duckweed duckweed in paddy fields is often overlooked but its rapid growth and rapid demise directly or indirectly affects the process of nitrogen transport and transformation in paddy fields duckweed absorbed and released a large amount of nitrogen during the process of growing and death with the swc change under awd in this process nitrogen can be reconfigured to reduce nitrogen loss and improve the utilization of urea or mineralized nitrogen this might also be one of the reasons why awd had a higher dry matter quality and yield than fi it also verified that awd can effectively inhibit the growing of dominant weeds in paddy fields qiu et al 2015 nitrogen has little restriction on the growing of duckweed and duckweed can use a very small amount of nitrogen or nitrogen stored by itself for rapid reproduction toyama et al 2018 therefore the effect of the urea application regimes on the growing of duckweed was not investigated in this study 4 3 ttwn study and errors reduction many researchers have also studied the ttwn under different water and nitrogen application regimes in paddy fields maruyama et al 2008 zhao et al 2012b li et al 2015 kyaw et al 2005 chowdary et al 2004 due to the influence of the study area means of observation hydrological years and other factors the results of the experiments of paddy fields are not exactly the same however we can speculate that increasing nitrogen fertilizer inputs would probably result in even more nitrogen gaseous losses to the atmosphere and leaching or runoff losses to water systems causing further substantial environmental damage likewise reducing nitrogen fertilizer inputs to an optimal nitrogen application rate might not necessarily result in obvious nitrogen deficiency fig 14 in addition the results of these field experiments could provide a basis for the construction of an accurate model of ttwn for paddy fields and reduce the labor needed to undertake field studies to our knowledge the processes of ttwn studied by many researchers were not as comprehensive as ours maruyama et al 2008 chowdary et al 2004 hitomi et al 2010 fu et al 2019 we have attempted to reduce the estimation errors in the observed nitrogen inputs or outputs with the following methodological improvements i the representative long term cultivation uniform texture and consistent leakage paddy fields were selected for the construction of experimental plots ii three replicates were designed for the same treatment and the samples were observed in time to calibrate the outliers iii the standard sample should be observed at the same time as the collected samples and the collected samples could be detected only after the standard sample was detected without error iv using the most advanced equipment and calibrating the instrument before being used v using common and recognized standards or operating manuals to observe and test it should be noted however that certain errors in the estimates remain mainly due to the lack of accurate and direct measurement methods for nitrogen input by bio fixation dndc model was selected to simulate the biological nitrogen fixation under different irrigation modes and urea application regimes in paddy fields fortunately we found nitrogen input by bio fixation was relatively small in our study and other studies obtained by some researchers so this limitation in indirect observations should not invalidate the conclusions above 5 conclusion comprehensive analyses of the transport and transformation of water and nitrogen in paddy fields under different irrigation modes and urea application regimes are of great significance to fully understand the mechanism of non point source pollution the nitrogen input of paddy fields was diversified although 135 kg ha 1 nitrogen could not meet the needs of rice growing the amount of nitrogen applied to paddy fields should not exceed 193 kg ha 1 drainage and leaching were not the main ways of nitrogen output from paddy fields but ammonia volatilization and nitrification denitrification were compared with flooding irrigation fi alternate wetting and drying awd reduced nitrogen output by drainage and leaching while the environmental effects of awd need to be further considered organic nitrogen mineralization was the largest nitrogen input to paddy fields except for urea application however further research should consider the in situ environment and its impact on groundwater in general awdn1f3 has a better effect on saving water and reducing nitrogen loss in paddy fields declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

10003,nitrogen pollution from paddy fields is a main contributor to global non point source nps pollution and greatly increases the risks of surface water eutrophication and groundwater contamination this study assesses the comprehensive transport and transformation of water and nitrogen ttwn for a 4 year irrigation and urea application in the paddy field using 6 water balance components and 12 nitrogen inputs and outputs the results show that alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation reduces water and nitrogen for irrigation drainage and leaching but has a minor effect on rice evapotranspiration etc urea application and mineralization are the most important nitrogen inputs to the paddy field accounting for 58 7 68 2 and 23 7 35 0 of nitrogen input respectively rice plant uptake ammonia volatilization av and nitrification denitrification account for 68 0 75 0 11 9 17 1 and 5 1 9 3 of nitrogen output respectively nitrogen leaching 3 5 11 5 kg ha 1 is also large while the observed depth of leaching needs to be further investigated meanwhile nitrogen drainage 0 72 1 11 kg ha 1 is not as large as conventionally accepted awd affects the nitrogen accumulation and release of duckweed which is one of the potential reasons for the increase in rice yields in the course of four continuous rice seasons the soil nitrogen content snc of the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers continued to decrease and increase respectively and the overall nitrogen content did not change significantly irrigation modes and fertilization splits may promote or inhibit av and it depended on the time when urea was applied in addition awd and three fertilization splits significantly promote nitrification denitrification and nitrogen uptake by rice this study presents a theoretical basis for nps pollution reduction and provides an important framework for establishing an accurate model of ttwn for paddy fields keywords alternate wetting and drying non point source pollution nitrogen input and output nitrogen decomposition denitrification 1 introduction agricultural irrigation utilizes approximately 72 of the world s water consumption moya et al 2004 in asia more than 90 of irrigation water is used for rice cultivation maeda et al 2011 rice cultivation consumes approximately 21 25 of the global nitrogen fertilizer requirement chauhan et al 2017 while urea is the most commonly used nitrogen fertilizer in paddy fields heffer and prud homme 2011 unfortunately excessive amounts of nitrogen fertilizers are being used in paddy fields deng et al 2011 typically rice cultivation uses flooding irrigation fi zhao et al 2012b grisp global rice science partnership 2013 han et al 2019b and the rice growing period is synchronized with the rainy season kumwimba et al 2018 there is therefore a big concern on the environmental impacts of inefficient irrigation modes and high nitrogen loads zhu et al 2006 ttwn is controlled by the comprehensive regulation of irrigation modes and fertilization regimes impacts the environment significantly based on many years of experimental research and practice water saving irrigation wsi which is now widely adopted by farmers mao 2002 belder et al 2004 dong et al 2012 sun et al 2012 ye et al 2013 lahue et al 2016 xu et al 2017 islam et al 2018 has significantly altered the water transport process and has been proven effective in saving water akter et al 2018 zhuang et al 2019 although the fertilization regime has a major influence on water movement it is mainly reflected in transpiration and the more fertilization the greater the transpiration cui et al 2004 studies have shown that wsi improves rainfall utilization inthavong et al 2011 sriphirom et al 2019 reduces the nitrogen taken by irrigation and increases the wet nitrogen utilization brought by rainfall kyaw et al 2005 liu et al 2011 however nitrogen brought by rainfall contributes to nps pollution and is random and uncontrollable researchers have been mainly concerned with the effects of nitrogen drainage and leaching on nps pollution from paddy fields belder et al 2005 yoshinaga et al 2007 cho et al 2008 yang et al 2015 wang et al 2014a fortunately wsi could significantly reduce nitrogen drainage and leaching mao 2002 however the two gaseous nitrogen transport processes av and denitrification are not easily detectable these two processes are also important factors in the nitrogen output of paddy fields wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 in china the annual av is estimated to be 2 80 3 55 tg zhang et al 2017 and the annual n2o loss is up to 138 154 gg in paddy fields liang et al 2013 it has also been determined that av and denitrification were stronger with the increase in fertilizer application xu et al 2012 yu et al 2015 bosch serra et al 2014 turner et al 2012 however the effect of wsi on av is still under debate peng et al 2009 yang et al 2012 and xu et al 2012 report that wsi inhibits av while cui et al 2004 yu et al 2015 and zhao et al 2010 suggest that wsi promotes av on the other hand wsi promoted denitrification in most cases especially in the process of soil water content swc change liu et al 2014 katayanagi et al 2012 wang et al 2018 in addition to wsi reducing nitrogen application can also directly reduce nitrogen drainage and leaching av and denitrification however the appropriate amount of nitrogen applied to paddy fields requires further research ata ul karim et al 2017 studies have shown that the nitrogen concentration in surface water remains high within 7 days after fertilization wang et al 2016 hua et al 2019 therefore increasing the fertilization splits lowering the nitrogen concentration of surface water after fertilization and reducing the risk of nitrogen drainage caused by rainfall are effective measures for reducing nps pollution mao 2002 gao et al 2009 second the amount of rainfall accumulated in paddy fields can be controlled by moderately lowering the surface water depth during the fertilization period thereby reducing nitrogen drainage cao et al 2019 however the effectiveness of this measure in reducing av and denitrification load is uncertain the nitrogen application rate of paddy fields and nitrogen uptake by rice plants are high while the characteristics of nitrogen uptake by rice remain unclear researchers have suggested that nitrogen uptake by rice is the product of nitrogen concentration in the root zone and transpiration chowdary et al 2004 however there are two issues that need to be resolved 1 accurately calculating the nitrogen concentration in the root zone that could be absorbed by rice and 2 sometimes there was no solution in the root zone under wsi when the paddy field was in moderate drying or field sunning during late tillering stage in addition only 20 30 of nitrogen fertilizer was absorbed by rice cui et al 2004 and the rest of the nitrogen requirement was mostly provided by organic nitrogen mineralization lehrsch et al 2016 in general wsi and nitrogen application promoted mineralization mohanty et al 2013 xu et al 2020 however zhao et al 2012a 2012b believed that fertilization inhibited the rate of soil mineralization microbial nitrogen fixation also provides some nitrogen for rice growing liu et al 2018 but it was difficult to observe this process liu et al 2014 during the growing stages rice is also subjected to competition from duckweed however duckweeds decay quickly and release a large amount of nitrogen after a drought li et al 2019 under wsi duckweed alternated between growing and decay playing a role in regulating water and nitrogen transport this regulatory role needs to be further studied various ttwn processes in paddy fields are complex and very difficult to analyze and evaluate simultaneously antonopoulos 2010 most researchers have focused only on observations of either a single or several obvious nitrogen pathways such as drainage leaching av and denitrification etc from either small plots or monolith lysimeters zhao et al 2012a chen et al 2014 hua et al 2019 maruyama et al 2008 chowdary et al 2004 hitomi et al 2010 fu et al 2019 these may fail to identify the comprehensive ttwn processes under specific climatic conditions and years of continuous cropping in the study area yang et al 2015 therefore in this study we conducted a 4 year plot experiment to study the ttwn under the couplings of different irrigation modes and urea application regimes in paddy fields from 2016 to 2019 the specific objectives of this study are 1 to comprehensively analyze ttwn processes and 2 to evaluate the environmental effects and sustainability of different irrigation modes and urea application regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and plot layout the experiment was conducted in rice plots of the dali comprehensive environmental monitoring station 100 07 43 e 25 49 59 n altitude 1975 m erhai irrigation district yunnan province china the monitoring station is located in the low latitude plateau the annual average temperature is 15 1 the annual average rainfall is 1041 mm and 85 96 of the rainfall is concentrated in may to october and an average annual sunshine of 2439 h in the recent 15 years soil bulk density is 1 24 g cm 3 volume saturated water content is 55 and volume field water holding rate is 47 2 the soil is silty loam with an average particle size of 19 26 µm at the start of the field experiment the initial soil total nitrogen tn total phosphorus total potassium nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n were 4 1

film the plastic film had a buried depth of 40 cm to prevent water inrush and lateral seepage the height and width of the ridge were both 40 cm irrigation water was supplied to each plot through pipes and a water meter was installed at the water outlet of each pipe a water gauge hobo water depth gauge and seepage measuring cylinder were installed in each plot each plot was divided into three depths to install leaching solution extractors 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm below the ground surface fig 1 2 2 treatment design the field experiment covered four consecutive rice seasons from 2016 to 2019 and there were two irrigation modes fi and awd the specific water depth control standard is shown in table 1 there were two nitrogen application levels n0 193 kg ha 1 traditional nitrogen application amount of the erhai irrigation district calculated by pure nitrogen and n1 135 kg ha 1 70 of the n0 two nitrogen split applications f2 tiller fertilizer tf panicle fertilizer pf 7 3 and f3 base fertilizer bf tf pf 5 3 2 the above conditions were combined into eight treatments and each treatment was set with three repetitions the total number of plots was 24 and each plot was randomly arranged urea was applied to all plots and both phosphorus 65 kg ha 1 and potassium 65 kg ha 1 fertilizers were applied to the paddy field with the base fertilizer during the planting process of the four rice years middle season rice was planted and the communities where the treatments were located remained unchanged 2 3 observation contents and methods the ttwn in paddy fields involves 6 water balance elements

water depth per unit area 2 drainage was calculated according to the difference between the field water depth before and after drainage 3 water depth was observed by a water gauge and a self recording water level gauge at 8 00 a m every day 4 leaching was observed daily by a thin walled seepage measuring cylinder installed at the bottom of the plow without disturbing the field covered to prevent rain and direct sunlight 5 etc was measured based on the daily field water consumption minus daily leaching 6 rainfall was measured by an automatic weather station installed in the station 7 swc was monitored hourly by an em50 soil water sensor during rice growing stages 2 3 2 nitrogen transport and transformation 1 changes of field surface water nitrogen concentration after fertilization surface water samples were taken every day from the first to the third day and then every other day for 9 days followed by every 3 days and every 7 days until the end of the test 2 nitrogen drainage rainfall exceeding the limit of field rainfall was drained and collected and the volume and nitrogen concentration of these drainages were observed the nitrogen drainage loss caused by one rainfall event was the product of the drainage volume and nitrogen concentration 3 nitrogen leaching in order to explore the change in nitrogen in the vertical direction of soil water leaching solution extractors were installed at three depths 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm in each community to sample the leaching solution the sampling time was the same as that of the field water linear interpolation was used to estimate the nitrogen concentration which was not observed 4 wet nitrogen deposition three rain collection samplers were set in the test station with an interval of 300 m collection samplers were emptied after each collection and periodically cleared especially when it was to rain http www mee gov cn ywgz fgbz bz bzwb jcffbz shtml the product of nitrogen concentration and rainfall in a single rainfall event was the wet deposition of nitrogen 5 nitrogen brought by irrigation water samples were taken at the early middle and late stages of irrigation to observe the nitrogen concentration in irrigation water the product of average nitrogen concentration and the irrigation amount was the amount of nitrogen brought into the field by irrigation 6 soil organic nitrogen mineralization two cultivation methods were evaluated for soil organic nitrogen mineralization flooding cultivation fc and alternate wetting and drying cultivation ac mikha et al 2005 these two methods correspond to the mineralization characteristics of paddy soil under fi and awd respectively at each growing stage of rice fresh soil samples were collected from field plots and loaded into mineralized tubes and the tubes containing soil samples were buried into the field for in situ culture each buried mineralized tube was taken out when mineralized tubes of the next growing stage buried for cultivation and brought back to the laboratory for leaching to observe the concentration of ammonia nitrogen li et al 2019 7 av the observation and calculation of the daily av load were observed using the improved ventilation method designed by xu et al 2012 pvc collectors 20 cm in height with phosphoglycerol soaked sponges were used fig 1 inside each tube has two sponges the upper one to trap ammonia from the air and the lower one to capture ammonia volatilized from the paddy field the samples collected in the phosphoglycerol soaked sponge from the plots by the pvc collectors were immediately immersed in 300 ml of 1 0 mol l 1 kcl solution in 500 ml containers and were shaken by a reciprocating shaker before the extracted solutions were analyzed the sampling time was consistent with the field water sampling the av rate of field soil was calculated using eq 1 1 r av 10 2 m a d where r av is the av rate kg ha 1 d 1 m is the daily ammonia collected by the pvc collector mg d 1 a is the cross sectional area of the pvc

a point and the box was wrapped with sponge and glass fiber aluminum foil cloth to prevent excessive temperature changes in the box due to sun exposure there was a fan in the box to make the gas mixed evenly fig 1 when collecting gas the sampling box was buckled vertically in the groove of the base and water was added to seal it to prevent gas leakage after buckling the box a 50 ml syringe was used to extract the gas at 0 10 20 and 30 min the rate of n2o emission is derived from the rate of change of the gas concentration over time the calculation formulas are 2 f ρ v a d c d t 273 273 t 3 c i 1

fixation by microbes the denitrification decomposition dndc model li 2000 was used to simulate the amount of microbial nitrogen fixation in paddy fields under fi and awd and to analyze the amount and process of nitrogen fixation 11 nitrogen uptake by rice plants rice plant samples were taken during each growing stage and the daily rice dry matter quality curve was plotted by measuring the dry matter quality using the drying method then the total nitrogen content of the rice plants and the daily total nitrogen content were plotted the nitrogen accumulation in rice is the product of the daily dry matter mass and the daily nitrogen content the difference in nitrogen accumulation between two adjacent days is the daily rice nitrogen uptake 12 nitrogen uptake and release of duckweed an experiment on the growing characteristics of duckweed under different water treatments was designed indoors to avoid rain there were three treatments continuous flooding cf where there was always a water layer on the surface of the paddy field moderate drought md when the swc decreased to 80 θ s and severe drought sd when the swc decreased to 70 θ s before re watering the cf treatment mainly observed the natural mortality of duckweed md and sd were used to observe the decay and death of duckweed under different drought conditions in paddy fields and the growing characteristics after re watering each treatment had 3 repetitions with a total of 9 incubators the concentrations of tn nh4 n and no3 n in water samples were measured by alkaline potassium persulfate uv spectrophotometry naismith s reagent uv spectrophotometry and hydrochloric acid acidification uv spectrophotometry respectively the tn content in plants and soil was determined by the kjeldahl method n2o was determined by gas chromatograph bao 2000 3 results and analysis 3 1 change of water balance elements change of daily water balance elements under different treatments were observed during the rice growing stages in 2016 2019 fin0f2 farmers traditional water and urea mode and awdn1f3 potentially recommended water and urea mode of 2016 2019 were chosen to illustrate the accumulation process of water balance elements fig 2 there was always a certain water depth under fi except for the sun drying during the later tillering stage and the natural falling dry during the yellow maturity stage table 1 however the swc dropped below saturation many times under awd fig 2 this also led to differences in percolation the percolations were 137 2 205 8 mm under awdn1f3 and 173 6 230 1 mm under fin0f2 in 2016 2019 respectively etc were 466 0 518 8 mm under awdn1f3 and 484 6 539 5 mm under fin0f2 respectively and the average annual etc under awd was approximately 20 mm less than that under fi the irrigation water were 68 1 mm 70 0 mm 103 8 mm and 66 3 mm under awdn1f3 and 150 8 mm 155 9 mm 230 2 mm and 204 5 mm under fin0f2 in 2016 2019 respectively simultaneously the drainage water were 210 3 mm 189 7 mm 30 4 mm and 33 7 mm under awdn1f3 and 200 5 mm 273 7 mm 71 5 mm and 120 mm under fin0f2 respectively it showed that the amount of irrigation water under awd was significantly less than that under fi however the drainage water under awd was not always less than that under fi in addition the rainfall were 772 4 mm 764 3 mm 497 1 mm and 502 6 mm in 2016 2019 rice seasons respectively in general there was sufficient rainfall in 2016 and 2017 rice seasons while insufficient rainfall in 2018 and 2019 rice seasons 3 2 transport and transformation of nitrogen 3 2 1 nitrogen input by wet deposition mineralization irrigation and bio fixation daily rainfall and wet nitrogen deposition concentrations in 2016 2019 were monitored most of the wet nitrogen deposition concentrations were 0 90 5 85 mg l 1 and the nitrogen concentration in 2017 was generally higher than that in 2016 fig 3 the average rainfall per time in 2016 rice season was 45 1 mm while that in 2017 was 22 0 mm only half of that in 2016 the wet nitrogen deposition in 2016 and 2017 rice seasons were 13 2 and 16 3 kg ha 1 accounting for 8 5 and 12 1 of urea application respectively it was very close to the average value 16 12 kg ha 1 of a ten year monitoring experiment in southeast china by cui et al 2014 however it was higher than the value obtained by tan et al 2015 less than 4 kg ha 1 and only 50 of what xu et al 2018 obtained in the yangtze river basin most studies have shown that the wet nitrogen deposition fluxes in most areas were significantly greater than the global average of 3 5 kg ha 1 phoenix et al 2006 it means a large amount of nitrogen enters the environmental water by wet nitrogen deposition which is a stable nitrogen source for rice and other ecosystems he et al 2011 the cumulative nitrogen mineralization increased gradually with the cultivation progress while the mineralization amount per unit time will gradually decrease fig 4 and it was approximately 70 kg ha 1 over the whole growing period of rice and was 3 kg ha 1 more under ac than that under fc mineralization accumulation was 63 5 kg ha 1 after 60 day cultivation under fc accounting for 90 of the total mineralization compared with fc mineralization decreased by approximately 3 5 kg ha 1 after the first dry incubation under ac the mineralization results were consistent with results jyotiprava dash et al 2015 observed it was approximately 21 0 kg ha 1 less than what antonopoulos 2010 observed and 16 8 kg ha 1 more than what tan et al 2015 observed in addition the average mineralization under ac was higher than that under fc which was the same as in previous research mikha et al 2005 lu et al 2020 the observed nitrogen concentration in the irrigation water ranged from 0 27 to 6 37 mg l 1 average of 2 33 mg l 1 during the four rice seasons and average nitrogen input by irrigation were 3 65 2 78 4 11 and 2 73 kg ha 1 in 2016 2019 rice seasons respectively the nitrogen input by bio fixation under different treatments was 0 5 1 2 kg ha 1 and their absolute and relative quantities were small 3 2 2 change of nitrogen concentration in surface water and leaching water the nh4 n concentration in surface water under different treatments peaked on the 1st 2nd day after fertilization decreased rapidly after and then further decreased to a low level after 7 days of fertilization fig 5 the change of no3 n concentration in surface water was the same as nh4 n however the peaks of no3 n concentration were significantly delayed approximately 3 5 days later than that of nh4 n because urea hydrolysis and nitration nh4 ion converts to no3 ion required longer time saggar et al 2013 this was also why some researchers thought that nh4 n was the main monitoring factor in surface water in the early stage of fertilization and that no3 n was the main factor in the later stage wang et al 2003 the nitrogen concentration of leaching water at different depths showed an upward trend initially before decreasing fig 6 and an obvious decrease with increasing depth at the late rice growing stages and their peak values generally appeared around the 7th day after urea application the nitrogen concentration fluctuated around 4 mg l 1 at a depth of 20 cm in most cases remained around 4 mg l 1 in the early rice growing stage and dropped to 1 2 mg l 1 in the late stage at a depth of 40 cm and it fluctuated around 3 mg l 1 in the early rice growing stage and then decreased to 0 1 mg l 1 in the late stage at a depth of 60 cm on the whole the nitrogen concentration of leaching water had a small change at 0 40 cm depth during early rice growing stage and decreased at the 40 60 cm depth 3 2 3 nitrogen losses with water flow via drainage and leaching the nitrogen drainage under different treatments in 2016 2019 were 1 11 0 91 0 72 and 0 92 kg ha 1 respectively table 2 and the average nitrogen drainage was 0 91 kg ha 1 in 2016 2019 accounting for 0 56 of the average urea application the average nitrogen drainage was 0 02 kg ha 1 and 1 8 less under awd 1 1 kg ha 1 than that under fi 1 12 kg ha 1 0 2 kg ha 1 and 16 5 less under n1 1 01 kg ha 1 than that under n0 1 21 kg ha 1 0 07 kg ha 1 and 6 1 less under f3 1 07 kg ha 1 than that under f2 1 14 kg ha 1 it can be seen that awd n1 and f3 can reduce nitrogen drainage because the ridges of all plots were covered with plastic film and the plastic film had a buried depth of 40 cm nitrogen transport over 40 cm depth was defined as nitrogen leaching in 2016 2017 the nitrogen leaching at 40 cm depth were 5 75 and 8 9 kg ha 1 accounting for 3 5 and 5 4 of the urea application respectively fig 7 the average nitrogen leaching was 1 77 kg ha 1 and 21 6 less under awd 6 44 kg ha 1 than that under fi 8 21 kg ha 1 1 44 kg ha 1 and 17 9 less under n1 6 61 kg ha 1 than that under n0 8 05 kg ha 1 1 32 kg ha 1 and 16 5 more under f3 7 99 kg ha 1 than that under f2 6 67 kg ha 1 in conclusion both awd and n1 reduced nitrogen leaching while f3 increased nitrogen leaching to a certain extent nitrogen drainage and nitrogen leaching have been compared in previous studies yoshinaga et al 2007 cho et al 2008 in this study the average nitrogen drainage and nitrogen leaching were 1 16 and 6 99 kg ha 1 respectively nitrogen leaching was 6 times that of nitrogen drainage 3 2 4 gaseous nitrogen losses via av and nitrification denitrification the av rate increased rapidly after each fertilization and then decreased rapidly fig 8 1 3 days after fertilization was the key period for av av lasted for 7 9 days after application of bf and tf and lasted for 5 days after application of pf compared with bf and tf the peak value of av after pf application was smaller av accounted for 14 2 19 1 of urea application the average av was 3 3 kg ha 1 and 12 7 less under awd 22 7 kg ha 1 than that under fi 26 0 kg ha 1 7 8 kg ha 1 and 27 6 less under n1 20 5 kg ha 1 than that under n0 28 3 kg ha 1 5 6 kg ha 1 and 25 9 more under f3 27 2 kg ha 1 than that under f2 21 6 kg ha 1 awd reduced av n1 considerably reduced av and f3 considerably increased av the treatment with the lowest and largest av loss were w1n1f2 and w0n0f3 respectively this result was consistent with that of many researchers xu et al 2012 cao et al 2013 and smaller than wang et al 2018 reviewed av not only caused nitrogen losses but more importantly it increased the nitrogen concentration in wet deposition and exacerbated the formation of nps scudlark et al 2005 intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc et al 2006 wu et al 2016 the n2o fluxes were significantly affected by urea application and water management which increased immediately either through fertilization or swc change fig 9 and they decreased rapidly after fertilization and were lower in the late rice growing stage in addition n2o fluxes were not significantly different over a long period of flooding the cumulative n2o emissions was 0 48 kg ha 1 and 54 0 less under awd 1 37 kg ha 1 than that under fi 0 89 kg ha 1 which were close to the nitrogen drainage and equivalent to approximately 10 of av this result was similar to the 1 00 kg ha 1 cumulative n2o emissions bhattacharyya et al 2012 obtained and within 1 77 0 86 kg ha 1 measured by hao et al 2016 the conclusion that awd significantly promoted denitrification was the same as hwang and hanaki 2000 liu et al 2014 tan et al 2015 and liao et al 2020 although the denitrification load was relatively small its greenhouse effect was very significant so denitrification needed to be inhibited wu and zhang 2014 this was also a large negative impact of awd and other wsi modes on rice cultivation 3 2 5 nitrogen uptake by rice the dry matter mass of rice increased almost linearly and the growth rate was approximately 0 1 t ha 1 d 1 it varied from 11 4 to 13 5 t ha 1 under different treatments at harvest time and there was no significant difference between the two rice seasons fig 10 the nitrogen content of rice plants remained unchanged at first and then decreased continuously with the maximum at the late tillering stage and the minimum at the yellow ripening stage fig 11a nitrogen content increased slightly at the heading flowering stage which may be related to the pf application li 2016 the nitrogen content of rice continued to decrease when the leaves began to block each other ata ul karim et al 2017 the nitrogen uptake by rice was observed during the entire growing period in 2017 rice season it increased and then decreased reaching a peak approximately 90 days after transplanting with an average growing rate of 1 4 kg ha 1 d 1 and then decreased to the average nitrogen uptake of 113 3 kg ha 1 at harvest time at a rate of 0 3 kg ha 1 d 1 fig 11b this was similar to the reported values of antonopoulos 2010 belder et al 2005 and tan et al 2015 it was slightly higher under awd than that under fi which was the same as tan et al 2015 obtained however dong et al 2012 found it was 13 6 more under awd than that under fi 3 2 6 nitrogen release and uptake by duckweed duckweed dry matter and nitrogen content both continuously decreased with growing under cf they also decreased continuously with the swc decrease under md and sd fig 12 and the daily average natural mortality rate of duckweed was 1 5 dry matter were 34 5 and 9 9 kg ha 1 when swc reached 80 θ s and 70 θ s respectively the corresponding dry matter maxima were 51 2 and 15 4 kg ha 1 after re watering however it can be seen that not all duckweed regenerated after re watering and the excessive drought caused most of the duckweed to wither and die duckweed nitrogen content was close to 3 0 fig 12c which was higher than that in some wetland plants han et al 2019a including paddy rice fig 11 they were 2 65 and 2 48 when the swc reached 80 θ s and 70 θ s respectively after re watering duckweed regenerated and the nitrogen content rose to 2 74 and 2 5 at the end of the experiment 3 2 7 change of snc the snc continuously decreased at 0 20 cm depth and increased at 20 40 cm depth in the rice seasons of 2016 2018 and it increased after rice harvest compared with that before transplanting and the difference in snc between each soil layer was reduced at 0 40 cm depth in the 2019 rice season fig 13 after four rice seasons the average snc under awd and fi decreased by 13 5 and 15 1 at the 0 10 cm layer respectively and they decreased by 1 7 and 1 2 at the 10 20 cm layer respectively however they increased by 16 0 and 16 7 at the 20 40 cm layer respectively the decrease in snc was mainly caused by nitrogen drainage nitrogen leaching and av at the 0 20 cm layer gao et al 2005 the snc at the 20 40 cm layer continued to increase because this layer was dense and could absorb the leached nitrogen zhao et al 2012a further analysis showed that the variation of snc at different depths under n1 and f3 were consistent with that under awd in conclusion awd n1 and f3 increased the soil nitrogen inventory reduced urea loss and decreased nitrogen loss compared with fi n0 and f2 respectively 3 3 nitrogen input and output fig 14 presents the nitrogen inputs and outputs of the rice season in 2017 nitrogen inputs and outputs were 216 6 295 9 kg ha 1 and 160 5 212 8 kg ha 1 respectively nitrogen surpluses were 44 2 56 1 kg ha 1 under n1 and 82 9 95 6 kg ha 1 under n0 respectively and the surplus nitrogen was stored in the plow pan 20 40 cm or more deep soil layer fig 13 under n1 the urea applied amount 135 0 kg ha 1 was less than the nitrogen output which required mineralization wet nitrogen deposition and irrigation to bring in part of the nitrogen for rice growing under n0 the fertilizer application amount 193 0 kg ha 1 was close to the nitrogen output in paddy fields the urea application was the main source of nitrogen input accounting for 58 7 68 2 of nitrogen input and the proportions had no significant difference under awd and fi however the effect of organic nitrogen mineralization was also obvious which accounted 23 7 35 0 of nitrogen input in terms of nitrogen output rice plant uptake accounted for 68 0 75 0 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different irrigation modes and urea application regimes on nitrogen input 4 1 1 mineralization compared with the urea application the nitrogen input by mineralization was also large cui et al 2004 found that nitrogen uptake by rice only accounted for 20 0 30 0 of the nitrogen fertilizer applied using isotope tracer tests and nitrogen uptake mainly came from mineralization the difference in mineralization between different treatments was not significant which might be related to the fact that the indoor simulation cannot reflect the real environment of the paddy field lehrsch et al 2016 the indoor flooded culture method in our study is widely used because of its simplicity and better reproducibility of results song et al 2017 simultaneously it was difficult to simulate the impact of natural conditions and farmland management patterns on the soil environment lehrsch et al 2016 however mikha et al 2005 and yemadje et al 2017 found the flush of mineralized nitrogen seemed to be mostly microbial in origin and unaffected by alternate wetting and drying of soil other studies suggested that the mineralization was affected by the amount of nitrogen application the higher the amount of nitrogen application the greater the amount of mineralization presenting a priming effect kuzyakov 2010 the main reason was that applied nitrogen occupied and supplemented the position of mineralized nitrogen and the mineralized nitrogen actually ultimately came from nitrogen application in combination with fig 13 this result seems to be reasonable as the total nitrogen content of paddy soil barely changed after four rice seasons when the accumulation of mineral nitrogen in the soil exceeds the requirement for rice growing nitrogen will leach into the groundwater and cause water pollution zhang et al 2012 although researchers have paid more attention to water pollution caused by nitrogen leaching in paddy fields mao 2002 cui et al 2017 there is insufficient understanding of water pollution caused by mineralization the assessment of the contribution of mineralization to water pollution is inaccurate zhang et al 2012 in addition mineralization also affects the assessment of nitrogen leaching making it difficult to accurately calculate nitrogen leaching from fertilization 4 1 2 wet nitrogen deposition among all the nitrogen inputs and outputs in paddy fields wet nitrogen deposition is the only process that is not affected by irrigation mode and urea application regime besides wet nitrogen deposition had a high nitrogen concentration fig 3 which was more frequent and widely distributed than fertilization and more conducive for the uptake and utilization by rice ishii et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 however we should be soberly aware that a large amount of nitrogen enters the environmental water through wet nitrogen deposition causing water pollution and eutrophication he et al 2011 not just a stable nitrogen input in paddy fields 4 1 3 irrigation compared with wet nitrogen deposition the amount of nitrogen input by irrigation was relatively small under different irrigation modes especially awd because irrigation water was from the reservoir and had low nitrogen content however it is common to irrigate paddy fields with multiple water sources and return flow now wu et al 2019a 2019b the nitrogen content in these water sources was generally higher than that in reservoirs and the effect of these water sources on the nitrogen transport in paddy fields have to be studied further 4 2 effects of different irrigation modes and urea application regimes on nitrogen output 4 2 1 drainage drainage is an important way of nitrogen loss from paddy fields in the conventional understanding cho et al 2008 however nitrogen loss via drainage were not too much under different irrigation modes and urea application regimes which were less than that input by irrigation fig 13 the main reasons are as follows 1 the nitrogen concentration in surface water was relatively large within 7 days after fertilization fig 5 more nitrogen was drained if rainfall caused drainage during this period in our study the drainage date in each rice season was not frequent within 7 days after fertilization 2 the surface water depth during fertilization was controlled at approximately 30 mm table 1 which neither affected urea hydrolysis nor caused nitrogen drainage due to sudden rainfall at the same time the limit water depth after rainfall was set at 80 mm table 1 and the probability that the surface water depth exceeded this standard due to a single rainfall was low which ensured that most of the rainfall was stored in the plot avoiding drainage and improving the rainfall utilization rate 3 increasing the fertilization splits and reducing the amount of fertilizer applied reduced the nitrogen concentration level of surface water and the risk of nitrogen drainage after fertilization and increased the nitrogen utilization in the late growing stage of rice the study by cui et al 2001 showed that bf tf jointing booting fertilization heading flowering fertilization 3 3 3 1 was a high efficiency technical measure for fertilizer utilization in paddy fields however this might increase the labor cost and the f3 proposed in this paper may be a better choice 4 2 2 leaching drainage occurs accidentally due to excessive rainfall while leaching continues in paddy fields for nitrogen leaching in paddy fields a wide range of values has been reported by different studies zhao et al 2012a wang et al 2014b in addition to differences in soil texture water and fertilizer patterns chowdary et al 2004 song et al 2005 aparicio et al 2008 constantin et al 2010 hansen et al 2010 xiong et al 2010 hitomi et al 2010 nitrogen leaching observation has always been difficult there is no consensus on what depth can leached nitrogen be considered as nitrogen leaching in the paddy field zhao et al 2012a tian et al 2007 the final results obtained by using different depths as observation points of leaching loss are different and not all leached nitrogen enters the external water body in this study three depths of leaching samplers were set up to explore the vertical law of leaching loss fig 1 considering that the water barrier of the ridge membrane between the plots was 40 cm it would be affected by groundwater beyond this depth nitrogen leaching was calculated at a depth of 40 cm which might be different from the actual situation therefore a standard observation and calculation method for nitrogen leaching was expected to be found on a regional scale for the comparison of results in rice paddies and the evaluation of nitrogen leaching into groundwater zhao et al 2012a 4 2 3 av av losses was more than nitrogen drainage and leaching which obtained more and more attention however the effect of irrigation modes and fertilization regimes on av is still under debate xu et al 2015 pan et al 2016 in this study nh4 n penetrated the soil more effectively during the downward movement of water under awd and more nh4 n was adsorbed by soil colloids reducing the probability of av zaman et al 2013 when there were continuous water layers in the fields under different irrigation modes before fertilization due to rainfall awd did not reduce the av xu et al 2015 compared with f2 f3 increased the base fertilizer at this time the nitrogen uptake and leaf area index of rice were both small leading to large av with the same amount of fertilizer av was much lower at the later rice growing stage fig 7 therefore whether awd and increasing urea splits promote or inhibit av depends on the time when urea was applied chen et al 2020 factors affecting the av rate include ph meteorological factors planting structure and national policies hayashi et al 2008 huang et al 2012 wang et al 2018 after comparative analysis with multiple factors it was found that av had a great relationship with the nh4 n concentration of the field surface water from a comparison of figs 5 and 8 it can also be seen that the nh4 n concentration and the av rate are highly consistent 4 2 4 release and uptake by duckweed duckweed in paddy fields is often overlooked but its rapid growth and rapid demise directly or indirectly affects the process of nitrogen transport and transformation in paddy fields duckweed absorbed and released a large amount of nitrogen during the process of growing and death with the swc change under awd in this process nitrogen can be reconfigured to reduce nitrogen loss and improve the utilization of urea or mineralized nitrogen this might also be one of the reasons why awd had a higher dry matter quality and yield than fi it also verified that awd can effectively inhibit the growing of dominant weeds in paddy fields qiu et al 2015 nitrogen has little restriction on the growing of duckweed and duckweed can use a very small amount of nitrogen or nitrogen stored by itself for rapid reproduction toyama et al 2018 therefore the effect of the urea application regimes on the growing of duckweed was not investigated in this study 4 3 ttwn study and errors reduction many researchers have also studied the ttwn under different water and nitrogen application regimes in paddy fields maruyama et al 2008 zhao et al 2012b li et al 2015 kyaw et al 2005 chowdary et al 2004 due to the influence of the study area means of observation hydrological years and other factors the results of the experiments of paddy fields are not exactly the same however we can speculate that increasing nitrogen fertilizer inputs would probably result in even more nitrogen gaseous losses to the atmosphere and leaching or runoff losses to water systems causing further substantial environmental damage likewise reducing nitrogen fertilizer inputs to an optimal nitrogen application rate might not necessarily result in obvious nitrogen deficiency fig 14 in addition the results of these field experiments could provide a basis for the construction of an accurate model of ttwn for paddy fields and reduce the labor needed to undertake field studies to our knowledge the processes of ttwn studied by many researchers were not as comprehensive as ours maruyama et al 2008 chowdary et al 2004 hitomi et al 2010 fu et al 2019 we have attempted to reduce the estimation errors in the observed nitrogen inputs or outputs with the following methodological improvements i the representative long term cultivation uniform texture and consistent leakage paddy fields were selected for the construction of experimental plots ii three replicates were designed for the same treatment and the samples were observed in time to calibrate the outliers iii the standard sample should be observed at the same time as the collected samples and the collected samples could be detected only after the standard sample was detected without error iv using the most advanced equipment and calibrating the instrument before being used v using common and recognized standards or operating manuals to observe and test it should be noted however that certain errors in the estimates remain mainly due to the lack of accurate and direct measurement methods for nitrogen input by bio fixation dndc model was selected to simulate the biological nitrogen fixation under different irrigation modes and urea application regimes in paddy fields fortunately we found nitrogen input by bio fixation was relatively small in our study and other studies obtained by some researchers so this limitation in indirect observations should not invalidate the conclusions above 5 conclusion comprehensive analyses of the transport and transformation of water and nitrogen in paddy fields under different irrigation modes and urea application regimes are of great significance to fully understand the mechanism of non point source pollution the nitrogen input of paddy fields was diversified although 135 kg ha 1 nitrogen could not meet the needs of rice growing the amount of nitrogen applied to paddy fields should not exceed 193 kg ha 1 drainage and leaching were not the main ways of nitrogen output from paddy fields but ammonia volatilization and nitrification denitrification were compared with flooding irrigation fi alternate wetting and drying awd reduced nitrogen output by drainage and leaching while the environmental effects of awd need to be further considered organic nitrogen mineralization was the largest nitrogen input to paddy fields except for urea application however further research should consider the in situ environment and its impact on groundwater in general awdn1f3 has a better effect on saving water and reducing nitrogen loss in paddy fields declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

10004,algal blooms fueled by phosphorus p enrichment are threatening surface water quality around the world although p loss from arable land is a critical contributor to p loads in many agricultural watersheds there has been a lack of understanding of p loss patterns and drivers across regions here we synthesized edge of field p and sediment runoff data for 30 arable fields in the canadian provinces of saskatchewan manitoba and ontario a total of 216 site years to elucidate spatial and temporal differences in runoff and p mobilization in snowmelt and rainfall runoff and discuss climatic soil and management drivers for these patterns across all regions precipitation inputs were positively correlated with runoff amounts and consequently p loads runoff and p losses were dominated by snowmelt across all sites however regional differences in runoff amounts and p concentrations loads and speciation were apparent proportions of total p in the dissolved form were greater in the prairie region 55 94 in manitoba than in the great lakes region 26 35 in ontario in manitoba dissolved p concentrations in both snowmelt and rainfall runoff were strongly positively correlated to soil olsen p concentrations in the 0 5 cm soil depth however this relationship was not found for ontario fields where tile drainage dominated hydrologic losses although precipitation amounts and runoff volumes were greater in ontario than manitoba some of the greatest p loads were observed from manitoba fields driven by management practices this synthesis highlights the differences across the canadian agricultural regions in p runoff patterns and drivers and suggests the need of co ordinated and standardized monitoring programs to better understand regional differences and inform management graphical abstract phosphorus runoff patterns vary with climatic regions across canada the dissolved p was measured as total dissolved p in mb and dissolved reactive p in sk and on total p was not measured in sk ga1 keywords agricultural management practice climate variability eutrophication nutrient transport water quality watershed management 1 introduction eutrophication is a widespread water quality problem causing algal blooms and fish kills and loss of ecological and economic value in many freshwater lakes around the world in canada for example both lake winnipeg in the west and lake erie in the east have been experiencing severe eutrophication with the frequency and magnitude of algal blooms increasing in the past decade schindler et al 2012 scavia et al 2014 in 2011 lake erie experienced an algal bloom of record setting magnitude michalak et al 2013 and in 2013 lake winnipeg was even named as the world s threatened lake of the year global nature fund 2013 in 2015 the bloom in lake erie broke the scale for algal bloom magnitude having surpassed the 2011 bloom seewer 2015 phosphorus p has long been regarded as a limiting nutrient for freshwater lakes schindler 1977 schindler et al 2016 although p inputs can originate from industrial municipal domestic and natural sources agriculture has been identified as the dominant source of p loading to both lake winnipeg and lake erie as well as many other lakes in canada council of canadian academies 2013 international joint commission 2014 consequently understanding the patterns and drivers of p losses from agricultural soils has become a fundamental research priority for mitigating p losses and maintaining downstream water security in canada almost all canadian crop production regions exist in cold climates i e the d class in the köppen geiger climate classification system peel et al 2007 in cold climate regions snowmelt runoff often plays a dominant role in annual runoff patterns and soil p mobilization and transport can be facilitated by the agronomic biogeochemical and hydrological characteristics found in these regions liu et al 2019a cold climate regions have short crop growing seasons that limit annual water and p consumption by crops in cold months infiltration of snowmelt and rain water on frozen ground is often impeded gray et al 2001 resulting in high snowmelt runoff volumes that represent a large proportion of annual runoff nicholaichuk 1967 glozier et al 2006 elevated p concentrations in runoff can result from freeze thaw of soils and vegetation which mobilize p elliott 2013 cober et al 2019 liu et al 2019c near surface flow paths associated with frozen or wet soils may also elevate p concentration in runoff particularly following p application as manure or fertilizer macrae et al 2007 liu et al 2017 cold conditions pose unique management challenges as fewer options for mitigating p losses exist in these regions as compared to in warmer regions baulch et al 2019 liu et al 2019a in addition cold climate regions still face the same challenges that are associated with rainfall runoff as in warmer regions including soil p management although cold climates are a common characteristic of agricultural fields across the canadian landscape it should be noted that the specific climates field crops and management practices vary widely across canada for example climatologically the canadian prairie region northern portion of the northern great plains region experiences more severe winters and drier summers than the great lakes region which is warmer and more humid crop production in the sub humid or semi arid prairie region is dominated by small grains and canola brassica napus l production whereas crops throughout the great lakes region are dominated by corn zea mays l and soybean glycine max l merr livestock production is found in both regions with dairy prevalent in the great lakes region and beef and hogs more common on the prairies with regards to land management practices subsurface drainage tiles connected to surface drainage ditches are widely used in the great lakes region to alleviate water ponding problems and reduce overland flow but are less common in the drier canadian prairie region where drainage is commonly achieved through surface drains and where soils remain frozen for a longer portion of the year a range of agronomic practices is found across both regions indeed conventional tillage conservation tillage and zero till equivalent to no till all exist within both regions soil p management and balances are variable throughout both regions and among the different production systems within each region reid and schneider 2019 all these variations in climates cropping systems and management practices can contribute to differing magnitudes and patterns of p loss from land to water complicating direct comparisons between regions a comprehensive characterization of magnitudes and variability in p losses from agricultural fields across canada is needed to better contextualize future studies and enable more accurate extrapolation and application of research findings across canada edge of field runoff monitoring is an important approach for collecting water quality data and further relating the data to climate soil and field management conditions as well as field and watershed processes in canada edge of field runoff monitoring has been conducted on a range of climates soils and management practices in saskatchewan manitoba and ontario since the 1960s data for the current study were available for the canadian prairies from saskatchewan and manitoba and for the great lakes region from ontario a large portion of these results have been documented separately in a series of publications e g tiessen et al 2010 2011 li et al 2011 liu et al 2013 2014a 2014b 2019b van esbroeck et al 2016 chen et al 2017 plach et al 2019 schneider et al 2019 wilson et al 2019 however most studies represent a subset of fields or years and the data have not been synthesized with a cross province or cross climate scope thus we synthesized edge of field p losses in runoff from 30 fields monitored during 1995 2017 in saskatchewan manitoba and ontario a total of 216 site years our objectives were to 1 compare p runoff patterns across different geographical and climatic regions 2 identify climatic soil and management drivers for the p runoff patterns and 3 provide insights into future research for agricultural p management and water quality this synthesis has important policy and programming implications for federal provincial and municipal governments 2 materials and methods the 30 fields included in this study extend from swift current 50 15 n 107 43 w in saskatchewan to locations in manitoba including kenton 49 59 n 100 36 w carberry 49 52 n 99 21 w the south tobacco creek stc watershed 49 20 n 98 22 w and sanford 49 40 n 97 26 w and in ontario from essex 42 10 n 82

large range of management practices fig 1 liu et al submission to dib in this study the overall water quality monitoring period spanned from 1995 to 2017 but the numbers of monitoring years varied with sites depending on data availability in total this study included 216 site years 2 1 field management and monitoring 2 1 1 the swift current fields in saskatchewan swift current sk1 sc is located in a semi arid climate fig 1 with long term mean annual temperature of 4 1 and mean annual precipitation of 360 mm coles et al 2017 the region is characterized by long cold winters short warm summers and approximately 24 of the annual precipitation occurred as snow during 1962 2013 coles et al 2017 long term edge of field monitoring was conducted in three rectangular adjacent fields 4 5 ha each fig 1 by agriculture and agri food canada during 1962 2011 and experiments were designed for evaluating the impacts of crop and tillage management on nutrient and sediment transport mcconkey et al 1997 schneider et al 2019 the original experimental results have been made publically available by mcconkey and thiagarajan 2018 and they were used for calculating seasonal and annual values in the current study the fields are gently sloped 4 and the soil is a swinton loam classified as orthic brown chernozem aridic haploboroll the fields underwent periodic treatments throughout the study period which were described in detail by schneider et al 2019 in this synthesis only the data from 1995 to 2011 were included because the water sampling techniques changed from grab sampling to automated sampling around 1994 during 1995 2011 field 1 sk1 sc f1 had a wheat triticum aestivum l and green manure rotation with conventional tillage and incorporation of crop residues field 2 sk1 sc f2 had a wheat fallow rotation during 1995 2002 and wheat pulse crop rotation during 2003 2011 both with zero till field 3 sk1 sc f3 had a wheat fallow rotation with conventional tillage throughout the study period nitrogen and p fertilizers were applied based on provincial recommendations schneider et al 2019 main management information is summarized in liu et al submission to dib to monitor runoff and water quality the fields were separated by raised grass berms to prevent transfer of flow between them in each field the depth of surface runoff from snowmelt and rain was measured using a stevens water level chart recorder belfort instrument company in the stilling well of a 0 6 m h flume that was installed at the outlet of the field the flumes were heated in cold weather to prevent icing in addition pressure transducers were also used to record water level the water level measurements were converted to daily and hourly flow rates using a rating curve developed for each field cessna et al 2013 water samples 0 5 l each were collected using an automated water sampler isco 3700 portable sampler passed through a no 42 filter paper whatman international and analyzed for dissolved reactive p using the method of hamm et al 1970 suspended sediment was measured as the oven dry weight of the solid remaining on the filter paper each year a series of snow surveys were conducted to measure snow depth and density at different locations in each field and at different times before snowmelt coles et al 2017 the survey data were used to calculate snow water equivalent swe which represents the amount of snow water available for runoff daily rainfall was recorded at a nearby weather station in addition soil test p was determined on samples collected at 0 15 cm depth each fall using the olsen method olsen et al 1954 2 1 2 the kenton carberry south tobacco creek watershed and sanford fields in manitoba in manitoba edge of field water quality monitoring was conducted by agriculture and agri food canada and environment and climate change canada at four different locations kenton mb1 ken 10 fields carberry mb2 car 3 fields the stc watershed mb3 stc 10 fields and sanford mb4 san 1 field fig 1 these locations are identified by the name of the closest town with the exception of the stc location which is named after the watershed because this watershed has been widely reported in literature and the name will be easier for cross referencing at the four locations monitoring periods were 2013 2017 2014 2017 1997 2017 and 2010 2015 respectively all locations have a sub humid continental climate for example the stc watershed has a long term mean annual temperature of 3 and mean annual precipitation of 550 mm and the respective means in sanford are 2 8 and 580 mm all fields are gently sloped with landforms varying from level 2 slope to undulating 2 5 slope soil classification working group 1998 except one field at kenton that has a greater slope 5 7 field size ranged from 1 to 28 ha fig 1 the soils ranged from orthic black chernozems in kenton and carberry and dark gray chernozems in the stc watershed to gleyed humic vertisols in sanford fig 1 the fields were used to study the drivers and the impacts of a large range of management practices on water quality the management practices of crop rotations tillage and nutrient applications for many of the fields have been described in detail in previous reports tiessen et al 2010 li et al 2011 liu et al 2014a 2014b 2019b chen et al 2017 wilson et al 2019 the crop rotations in most fields are dominated by cereals and oilseeds canola and flax while some fields were sown to perennial forages corn hemp cannabis sativa l etc tillage operations ranged from conventional high disturbance tillage to conservation tillage and zero till some fields received no p while others had fertilizer p applications and one field had fertilizer manure and feed p resulting from in field winter bale feeding in kenton in brief all 10 fields mainly grew small grains and canola and in some years hemp and pea pisum sativum l six of the fields mb1 ken f1 mb1 ken f2 mb1 ken f3 mb1 ken f4 mb1 ken f5 and mb1 ken f6 were conventionally tilled and have received beef cattle manure historically but received no p application during the periods of study while the other four fields mb1 ken f7 mb1 ken f8 mb1 ken f9 and mb1 ken f10 had zero till and fertilizer p applications in carberry all three fields grew wheat canola and soybean and received p fertilizers with zero till in mb2 car f1 and conservation tillage in mb2 car f2 and mb2 car f3 in the stc watershed field management practices were more complex than in other locations mb3 stc f1 and mb3 stc f2 had small grains and canola rotations conventional tillage and fertilizer p applications mb3 stc f3 mb3 stc f4 mb3 stc f7 and mb3 stc f9 had periods of both perennial forages zero till and no p and annual crops conventional tillage and fertilizer p and they were paired and used to study impacts of the two cropping systems on water quality liu et al 2014a mb3 stc f10 and mb3 stc f11 were paired fields with the same rotation of small grains and canola but different tillage operations and soil p management strategies tillage methods were contrasted during 1997 2007 conventional tillage in mb3 stc f10 and conservation tillage in mb3 stc f11 moreover both fields received conventional fertilizer p rates during 1997 2005 and reduced p rates during 2006 2017 these allowed to assess the impacts of tillage methods tiessen et al 2010 liu et al 2014b and soil p management liu et al 2019b on water quality mb3 stc f18 and mb3 stc f19 were another set of paired fields where in field winter bale feeding was implemented in mb3 ftc f18 but not in mb3 stc f19 chen et al 2017 in sanford the corn wheat soybean and canola rotations were conventionally tilled and received fertilizer p applications the management information for all 24 fields is summarized in liu et al submission to dib all 24 fields were individually monitored for runoff volume sediment total dissolved p and total p in both snowmelt and rainfall runoff typically levels of runoff were measured with an ultrasonic sensor and recorded with a data logger at a compound angle v notched weir that was installed at the lower edge of the field the water levels were then converted to flow rate at 5 min intervals using a standard v notched weir flow equation smith 1985 automated water samplers sigma autosampler 800sl at each weir were utilized to collect water samples during each runoff event observed at these sites for all water samples the concentrations of sediment total dissolved p and total p were determined in an accredited laboratory using standard methods as described by tiessen et al 2010 or wilson et al 2019 as in swift current snow surveys were conducted each year in most years to obtain swe and daily rainfall was recorded at a weather station in the watershed in most manitoba fields soil olsen p was determined for both 0 5 cm and 5 15 cm soil depths in fall olsen et al 1954 2 1 3 the essex londesborough and ilderton fields in ontario in ontario edge of field water quality monitoring was conducted at three locations during 2011 2017 essex 1 field on1 ess f1 londesborough 1 field on2 lon f1 and ilderton 1 field on3 ild f1 fig 1 all of the locations have temperate humid continental climates with 30 year mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation of 9 9 c and 935 mm in on1 ess f1 6 7 c and 1015 mm in on2 lon f1 and 7 8 c and 1012 mm in on3 ild f1 respectively environment and climate change canada eccc 2018 all three fields had a level or undulating landform 0 4 slope and were tile drained at the depth of 60 90 cm with tile spacing of 10 15 m

soybean soybean corn soybean rotation both on2 lon f1 and on3 ild f1 had a corn soybean wheat rotation on1 ess f1 and on2 lon f1 received fertilizer p only and on3 ild f1 received both fertilizer p and manure p tillage varied from disk annual tillage at on1 ess f1 to rotational shallow vertical tillage at on2 lon f1 to rotational strip tillage at on3 ild f1 more detailed information can be found in van esbroeck et al 2016 2017 lozier et al 2017 and plach et al 2019 and the main management information is summarized in liu et al submission to dib in each field runoff volume dissolved reactive p and total p were monitored in both overland flow and tile drainage the methods for flow monitoring water sampling and chemical analysis have been described in detail by van esbroeck et al 2016 and plach et al 2019 in brief overland flow was monitored using a culvert or drainage pipe on the soil surface and tile flow was measured at 15 min intervals in the tiles using direct measurements of simultaneous velocity and depth hatch flo tote 3 and fl900 data logger water samples in overland flow and tiles were collected using automated samplers iscos teledyne isco 6712 with periodic grab

rainfall and air temperature were recorded at each site and snowfall was recorded at nearby weather stations environment and climate change canada eccc 2018 validated by periodic snow surveys on site soil olsen p content after olsen et al 1954 was determined for the 0 5 cm and 5 15 cm soil depths in fall 2 4 times over the study duration 2 2 data analysis in this synthesis all data are presented at an annual time step and runoff p and sediment results are separated into snowmelt and rainfall categories to reflect the contrasting runoff processes rainfall and snowmelt runoff were separated based on the weather record showing if there was a rainfall event in the absence of rainfall any runoff from snow covered ground was attributed to snowmelt runoff on the contrary when there was no snow on the ground and rainfall was observed all runoff was assumed to have been derived from rainfall in the cases when rain on snow occurred which happened less often an accurate separation was hard and arbitrary judgment was made based on the amount of runoff relative to the amount of rainfall i e relative proportions of swe and rainfall to the event overall all p and sediment concentrations in runoff are annual flow weighted mean concentrations box and 3 d plots were made using the origin software origin version 2019 statistical analyses were conducted using sas 9 4 sas institute 2012 a proc univariate procedure was used to test the normality of data correlations between variables were assessed using the pearson s correlation analysis when the data were normally distributed and using the spearman s rank order correlation method for non normally distributed data hauke and kossowski 2011 a significance level of α 0 05 was used throughout the study unless specific p values were given 3 results and discussion in this cross region synthesis we summarized major results of edge of field runoff and p losses in 216 site years and attempted to explain the results using the information of climate landscape soil and field management different aspects of runoff and p loss are discussed for both snowmelt and rainfall runoff in the sections below the seasonal and annual values for individual fields that have been used for plotting the overall patterns of runoff and p loss are summarized in liu et al submission to dib 3 1 snowmelt and rainfall runoff runoff amounts varied widely across the 216 site years and presented clear regional differences for both snowmelt and rainfall runoff as well as annual runoff fig 2a from west to east fig 1 median annual runoff was 10 mm in saskatchewan s swift current 39 65 mm in the manitoba s kenton carberry stc watershed and sanford and 156 383 mm in the ontario s essex londesborough and ilderton fig 2a this reflects a clear climate gradient of the study regions i e semi arid in saskatchewan sub humid in manitoba and humid in ontario in individual site years although the proportion of snowmelt runoff in annual runoff varied from 0 to 100 fig 2b snowmelt runoff contributed an average of 49 or more to annual runoff in every field studied liu et al submission to dib for all site years within the same climate region snowmelt runoff contributed an average of 88 78 and 66 to annual runoff in the semi arid saskatchewan sub humid manitoba and humid ontario respectively these snowmelt contributions are large considering the fact that snowfall or swe accounted for an average of only 15 of annual precipitation over all 216 site years 10 in saskatchewan 18 in manitoba and 16 in ontario the results support previous reports on the dominant role of snowmelt runoff in other cold region watersheds rekolainen et al 1997 little et al 2007 and point to the need to prioritize snowmelt runoff for water quality research in cold climate regions although snowmelt dominated runoff in general it should be noted that rainfall runoff accounted for up to 51 of annual runoff in some fields and that in three of 216 site years rainfall was the only source of runoff thus knowledge and data are needed on both snowmelt and rainfall runoff this is especially important in light of climate change as parts of the canadian prairies are already experiencing increased rainfall driven runoff dumanski et al 2015 the variability in snowmelt and rainfall runoff exists not only across regions but also within the same study region fig 2a for example in the stc watershed where 103 site year data are available annual snowmelt runoff ranged from 0 to 224 mm and annual rainfall runoff ranged from 0 to 114 mm in general runoff amount is largely dependent upon the amount of water that is available for runoff i e precipitation inputs over all site years there was a significant positive correlation between snowmelt runoff and snow inputs measured either as swe in saskatchewan and manitoba or as snowfall in ontario fig 3a a significant but weaker correlation was also found between rainfall runoff and rainfall amounts fig 3b the weaker correlation in rainfall is expected because the contribution of rainfall to runoff is influenced more strongly by antecedent moisture conditions macrae et al 2010 lam et al 2016 which are driven by evapotranspiration interception and infiltration in saskatchewan and manitoba notably nearly 70 of site years had annual rainfall runoff amounts less than 5 mm in contrast annual rainfall runoff in ontario was much greater due to significantly greater rainfall amounts in addition to water availability runoff generation can be affected by landform and soil characteristics buda et al 2009 frozen unfrozen ground gray et al 2001 and management practices van der kamp et al 2003 as these factors vary and interact across fields it is hard to generalize the relative importance of the factors for all site years however some observations are reasonably apparent first all fields have relatively similar sizes and gentle slopes fig 1 thus the influence of landform on runoff generation may be expected to be similar however soil texture ranges from loam to clay across the different fields fig 1 and the extent of ground freezing changes with both regions and years which can have varying impacts on water infiltration and therefore runoff generation despite these differences across all site years it appears that the ratios of snowmelt runoff swe mean 0 64 were much greater than the ratios of rainfall runoff rain mean 0 04 this is largely because snowmelt infiltration is often limited when it occurs on fully or partially frozen ground dumanski et al 2015 or due to limited storage wet antecedent conditions during the non growing season macrae et al 2010 lam et al 2016 management practices can also affect runoff generation through influencing both water availability for runoff and water infiltration for example stubble management can affect snowmelt runoff by influencing snow accumulation through blowing snow processes and snowmelt through impacting surface energy balance harder et al 2019 in both swift current sk1 sc f2 versus sk1 sc f1 and sk1 sc f3 and the stc watershed mb3 stc f11 versus mb3 stc f10 conservation tillage or zero till permits more crop stubble to remain enabling the trapping of more snow which appears to have resulted in greater amounts of snowmelt runoff than conventional tillage in similar cropping systems comparisons between median values show that sk1 sc f2 had 12 17 mm more snowmelt runoff than sk1 sc f1 and sk1 sc f3 over 1995 2011 and mb3 stc f11 had 9 mm more snowmelt runoff than mb3 stc f10 over 1997 2007 drainage management affects water infiltration and runoff in fields tile drainage particularly affects runoff partitioning between surface and subsurface pathways however the efficacy of tiles in runoff partitioning differs across regions with different climates in ontario where 79 91 of annual precipitation occurred as rainfall and relatively warm temperatures allowed water infiltration during winters tile drainage accounted for 80 of total runoff in all 14 site years plach et al 2019 in contrast in manitoba tile drainage only accounted for 11 28 of annual runoff because most runoff occurred during snowmelt when fields were frozen kokulan et al 2019 3 2 phosphorus and sediments in snowmelt and rainfall runoff total p concentrations and loads in runoff varied widely with fields and years fig 2c d across all 216 site years annual flow weighted mean concentrations of total p ranged from 0 06 to 2 62 mg l 1 fig 2c and annual total p loads ranged from 0 01 2 50 kg ha 1 fig 2d notably neither the highest total p concentration nor load was found in ontario fig 2c d despite the fact that it had the greatest annual runoff amounts fig 2a the ontario fields were tile drained which likely helped to retain p in soils by routing surface runoff through the subsurface although tile drains have been shown to exacerbate p losses at the edge of field in some studies king et al 2015 subsoils have been shown to be able to retain p in other studies e g plach et al 2018a 2018b some of the greatest total p loads and concentrations were found in manitoba fields fig 4 where in field winter bale feeding added manure and feed p to runoff i e mb3 stc f18 where conservation tillage or zero till built up soil test p in the surface soils e g mb1 ken f9 mb1 ken f10 and mb3 stc f11 and where perennial forages elevated p concentrations in snowmelt runoff through serving as a vegetative p source and stratification of p occurred in the surface soil e g mb3 stc f3 and mb3 stc f9 overall snowmelt runoff dominated total p loss in all regions fig 2e with the average contribution ranging from 52 to 100 across the fields liu et al submission to dib in 132 out of 166 site years where total p was measured snowmelt contributed over 50 of annual total p loss in snowmelt runoff specifically annual flow weighted mean concentrations of total p ranged from 0 06 to 3 14 mg l 1 excluding years with no snowmelt runoff and annual total p loads ranged from 0 to 2 15 kg ha 1 fig 2 c d in contrast rainfall runoff concentrations and loads of total p ranged from 0 02 to 5 37 mg l 1 excluding years with no rainfall runoff and from 0 to 1 40 kg ha 1 respectively fig 2c d overall the pattern of dissolved p concentrations in relation to regions fig 2f was similar to that of total p fig 2c there is a stark contrast between manitoba fields and ontario fields in terms of proportion of dissolved p in total p fig 2g for annual runoff the average proportion of total dissolved p in total p for each field ranged 55 94 in manitoba whereas the proportion of dissolved reactive p in total p in ontario fields ranged 26 35 liu et al submission to dib these regional differences are not a result of the analysis of different p species i e tdp in mb and drp in on as a sub set of samples showed that drp accounted for the majority 90 of tdp in most of the samples across both regions unpublished data the dominance of dissolved p in manitoba is attributed to its gently sloped landform structural stability of chernozemic soils and frozen soils in winter for which soil erosion by water is generally low indeed annual sediment load was smaller than 0 25 mg ha 1 in 140 out of 150 manitoba site years fig 2h in saskatchewan s swift current fields total p was not measured and thus the proportion of dissolved p in total p is unknown but the proportion is likely high as found in many other prairie sites e g tiessen et al 2010 liu et al 2013 like manitoba the saskatchewan fields also had generally gentle slopes and low soil erosion and annual sediment load in 46 out of 50 site years was smaller than 0 25 mg ha 1 fig 2h in ontario in contrast although all sites also had gentle slopes p loads were dominated by the particulate p fractions indicating that erosive processes were occurring both in the surface and subsurface in both manitoba and ontario interestingly ratios of dissolved p to total p in rainfall runoff was positively correlated with the ratios in snowmelt runoff fig 5 even so it should be noted that the distribution of data points was clearly clustered by province with manitoba having generally greater dissolved p total p ratios in both snowmelt and rainfall runoff than ontario fig 5 across all site years in the provinces the average proportions of dissolved p were 79 for snowmelt runoff and 73 for rainfall runoff in manitoba and 31 for snowmelt runoff and 30 for rainfall runoff in ontario as demonstrated in fig 4 p runoff from land is driven by climate soil p concentrations and management practices that affect p source transport or both these drivers are respectively discussed in the sections below 3 2 1 climate impacts on phosphorus runoff across all sites both dissolved p and total p loads in snowmelt and rainfall runoff increased significantly with precipitation inputs fig 6 in all cases nonetheless the patterns of p loss are apparently clustered by regions with generally similar seasonal climates saskatchewan and manitoba had similar p runoff patterns which was contrasted by ontario that had much greater precipitation inputs throughout the study period but relatively smaller amounts of dissolved p losses in snowmelt runoff tests with the spearman s rank order correlation method showed that the inclusion of the ontario data weakened the correlation between p loss and snow water for both dissolved p and total p this is probably due to the fact that the ontario fields are tile drained which have affected edge of field p loss as discussed above in general the correlation between rainfall runoff p and rain water was much weaker than that between snowmelt p loss and snow water fig 6c versus fig 6a fig 6d versus fig 6b as discussed above generation of runoff derived from rainfall is affected by many hydrological and agronomic factors that affect dynamic water balance on the soil surface as a result no or little rainfall runoff occurred in saskatchewan and manitoba over many years with a wide range of annual rainfall amounts to better understand the relationship between rainfall amount and runoff volume and thus runoff p load further analyses should be conducted at an event level 3 2 2 soil test phosphorus and phosphorus runoff as discussed above p source is key to p loss in both snowmelt runoff and rainfall runoff across the 30 fields included in this study all except mb3 stc 18 in field winter bale feeding and on2 ild f1 manure applications received chemical p fertilizers as the only p additions during the monitoring period or no p additions at all in some years including all monitoring years for each field mean annual p application rate ranged from 0 to 18 kg ha 1 in saskatchewan and manitoba where crop rotations are dominated by small grains canola and forage crops in corn and soybean dominated ontario in contrast mean annual p application rates for each field ranged from 23 to 41 kg ha 1 the varying p inputs and soil tillage methods have resulted in differing soil olsen p concentrations in both 0 5 cm and 0 15 cm soil depths across the study fields liu et al submission to dib in a previous study synthesizing 57 recent site year data in manitoba wilson et al 2019 found that the soil olsen p concentration in the 0 5 cm soil depth was a significant predictor of dissolved p concentrations in snowmelt runoff our synthesis with an even larger dataset supports the finding of wilson et al 2019 and shows that in manitoba fields dissolved p concentrations in both snowmelt and rainfall runoff were strongly positively correlated with soil olsen p concentrations in the 0 5 cm soil depth fig 7 however it should be noted that the ontario fields do not follow the same relationship as manitoba again this is likely because the ontario fields were tile drained and the dissolved form of p originating from surface soils may be well retained in the soil profile while leaching to the subsurface layers plach et al 2018a 2018b it is also important to note that dissolved species of p are not the dominant fraction of p exported in ontario as particulate p represents the majority of p transported thus the weaker correlations between dissolved p and olsen p may reflect differences in transport mechanisms indeed duncan et al 2017 and pease et al 2018 observed substantial variability in relationships between soil p and runoff p in ohio and attributed this to differences in hydrology 3 2 3 management impacts on phosphorus runoff management practices synthesized varied widely in the study provinces although saskatchewan and manitoba had some common practice comparisons with regards to different tillage methods and different cropping systems there is a lack of common practice pairs between the prairie provinces and ontario as a result it is difficult to conduct management focused cross region comparisons based on the synthesized data however the synthesis has clearly shown that some management practices such as in field winter bale feeding zero or conservation tillage soil p management and perennial crops greatly affected p runoff in the prairies which may have relevance to ontario in the prairie region in field winter bale feeding is a common practice for beef production although the practice helps to build up soil fertility and save costs of transporting manure high losses of p in runoff from feeding fields also raise concerns over water quality chen et al 2017 our synthesis shows that the manitoba bale feeding field mb3 stc 18 had the greatest total p loss in both snowmelt and rainfall runoff among all the fields fig 4 which confirms animal agriculture as a hotspot for p losses in agricultural watersheds in ontario although winter bale feeding is not common other manure management challenges exist for example although the application of manure on frozen fields is strongly discouraged it is still periodically done when manure is applied to frozen ground it can considerably increase p loss in snowmelt runoff macrae et al 2007 these results indicate that the presence of manure on fields in winter consistently elevates p losses from fields and that this occurs across all of the study regions indeed winter manure management should be prioritized for managing p losses in the last several decades conservation tillage and zero till practices have increased dramatically across canada lobb et al 2007 although these practices were put in place to reduce erosion and p losses from fields this has led to unintended consequences in some landscapes for example in the canadian prairies where soil erosion is relatively mild and p loss is often dominated by dissolved p in snowmelt runoff reduced tillage appears to consistently increase p loss in paired manitoba fields tiessen et al 2010 found greater dissolved p and total p losses in reduced tillage systems than in conventional high disturbance tillage mb3 stc f10 versus mb3 stc f11 1997 2007 because reduced tillage permitted the build up and stratification of p in surface soils and also retained more snow cover leading to increased runoff the greatest p stratification was found when reduced tillage is combined with high rates of fertilizer p addition wilson et al 2019 in saskatchewan schneider et al 2019 found that a conversion from conventional tillage to zero till consistently increased snowmelt runoff and dissolved p losses sk1 sc f2 versus sk1 sc f3 1995 2002 thus although the magnitudes of p losses differ substantially between the semi arid saskatchewan and sub humid manitoba the present synthesis has shown that the relative effects of tillage on snowmelt p losses are similar across these regions liu et al submission to dib in contrast to the consistent effects of conservation tillage on p loss in the prairies the effects of reduced tillage in the great lakes region are not consistent unfortunately the current dataset does not permit a statistical comparison of the impacts of tillage across study regions however some qualitative conclusions can be drawn from the dataset and the existing literature both hydrological and p transport processes appear to differ across different regions within the great lakes region plach et al 2019 macrae et al 2021 in some regions of ontario p losses in surface runoff exceed p losses in tile drainage whereas in other regions e g southwestern ontario northwestern ontario tiles account for a more significant amount of p losses king et al 2015 plach et al 2019 macrae et al 2021 across the great lakes region total p losses are dominated by particulate p losses although to a greater extent in the undulating fields and watersheds to the northeast of lake erie north of lake ontario and east of lake huron macrae et al 2021 here reduced tillage is anticipated to play a more significant role in reducing total p loss than in manitoba and saskatchewan indeed one ontario study reported that conservation tillage reduced sediment and organic p losses from manured fields relative to a conventional till and had no effect on dissolved reactive p losses coelho et al 2012 another ontario study showed that tillage did not affect p losses in tile drainage in a sandy loam soil lam et al 2016 in contrast no till was reported to increase p losses in tile drainage in northwestern ohio king et al 2015 jarvie et al 2017 thus tillage appears to have different impacts on p loss across the canadian regions and it can also have variable impacts on p losses within a region such as the great lakes region crops affect p runoff through influencing soil p and water balances and dynamics in cold agricultural regions moreover crops can become a source of p loss from land to water liu et al 2019c when plant cells and tissues are damaged by freeze thaw events and consequently release p jones 1992 this process has likely contributed to p in snowmelt runoff in all fields synthesized here as they are all located in cold regions where winter crops or crop residues are exposed to repeated freeze thaw cycles however the vegetative p contributions to runoff is expected to be different for the prairie region and for ontario in the prairies liu et al 2014a and schneider et al 2019 have shown that perennial forages and green manure significantly increased annual flow weighted mean concentrations of dissolved p in snowmelt runoff as compared to annual crops and summer fallow respectively sk1 sc f1 versus sk1 sc f3 mb3 stc f3 versus mb3 stc f4 and mb3 stc f7 versus mb3 stc f9 although crops can have multiple impacts on p runoff and the impacts are complicated when crop factors interact with other management practices such as tillage and p input rates studies have suggested that vegetation at least accounts for part of snowmelt p runoff in the prairie region elliott 2013 in ontario in contrast it appears that vegetation does not exacerbate p loss at the same magnitude as in the prairies indeed cober et al 2019 found that p concentrations did not differ between cover cropped and bare plots on a field lozier et al 2017 found that p losses at the edge of the field were less than the p released from plants and argued that any p lost from plants was retained on fields this indicates that the efficacy of cover crops and residues and their risk of unintended consequences appears to differ regionally across canada 3 3 implications on future research currently there is a lack of synthesis of cross region water quality research in canada our effort has been challenged by the inconsistency of experimental treatments and monitored parameters in different provinces and regions largely because edge of field monitoring is costly and often constrained by the availability of research funds and labor for example the impacts of livestock grazing perennial forages and soil p management on water quality have not been studied in saskatchewan and ontario as intensively as in manitoba in addition sediment loss was measured in saskatchewan and manitoba but not in ontario and the dissolved form of p in runoff was measured as dissolved reactive p in saskatchewan but as total dissolved p potentially containing dissolved organic p in addition to dissolved reactive p in manitoba all these have challenged comparisons in management impacts among the provinces however this study points to the importance of co ordinated and standardized cross region water quality monitoring programs to comprehensively understand the science behind our observations this is especially important in the context of climate change for which co ordinated and standardized cross regional monitoring programs will help to contextualize research findings into future climates indeed annual mean temperature annual precipitation and daily extreme precipitation are all projected to increase across canada over the next 80 years bush and lemmen 2019 which will impact the climatic drivers for nutrient transport and confound the efficacies of beneficial management practices this study also demonstrates the importance of exploring innovative practices to manage soil p tillage crop residue cover crops and livestock to minimize p losses however it demonstrates that the efficacy of different management practices may differ across regions for example conservation tillage may reduce p losses in some regions e g ontario but exacerbate p losses in others manitoba cover crops may be problematic for winter p losses in the prairie region but have little effect on winter p loss in the great lakes region soil p management is a key issue as it is closely related to both water quality and food security this synthesis has highlighted that runoff p concentrations increase with increasing soil test p concentrations across the study regions thus more research is needed to identify measures that can reduce soil p concentrations to improve water quality without impacting crop productivity in addition although the impact of in field winter bale feeding was assessed in one field only it consistently resulted in the largest runoff p concentrations among all fields indeed opportunities exist to manage winter manure to mitigate p losses and more research on livestock production systems is generally needed in canada there are many industry and government directives recommendations for management practices to reduce p losses from agricultural land such as government best management practices extension documents and environmental farm plan workbooks municipal watershed management plans and industry sector codes of practice however concerns have arisen with regards to the consistencies and inconsistencies of these directives recommendations as they are often based on blanket applications resulting from the lack of good scientific information and they have not sufficiently considered the differences and similarities in the drivers controlling p losses across regions again co ordinated and standardized monitoring programs should be used to ensure the efficacy of management practices are appropriately evaluated and best practices are implemented across canada to address the current and future climate challenges 4 conclusions both the canadian prairie and the great lakes regions face increasing challenges in reducing p loads to freshwater lakes at present however there is a paucity of cross regional comparisons this synthesis of a large dataset in saskatchewan manitoba and ontario demonstrates some similarities and differences in runoff and p loss patterns between the two regions although the climate drivers and precipitation amounts and forms differ across the regions total p loads from fields are generally within the same range 2 5 kg ha 1 in all cases snowmelt dominates annual p budgets but to a greater extent in the prairies than in the great lakes region the predominant form of p differs across canada with most losses in a dissolved form in the prairie region and most as particulate p in the great lakes region this spatial difference is observed for both snowmelt and rainfall runoff the difference in the dominant p forms suggests that different beneficial management practices may be needed to reduce dissolved p and particulate p losses in the two regions respectively although the ontario sites had much greater snow and rain inputs throughout the study period the largest total p losses were found in some of the manitoba fields where winter bale feeding fertilizer inputs with zero or conservation tillage and perennial crops built up soil test p concentrations in the surface soils and or provided additional p sources this highlights the importance of reducing p sources in mitigating p runoff while soil test p is a strong indicator of the risk of p runoff loss in the prairies it appears to need to be complimented by considering additional factors in predicting p loss in ontario moreover the synthesis suggests the need of co ordinated and standardized monitoring programs to better understand regional differences and inform management in both the canadian prairie and

10004,algal blooms fueled by phosphorus p enrichment are threatening surface water quality around the world although p loss from arable land is a critical contributor to p loads in many agricultural watersheds there has been a lack of understanding of p loss patterns and drivers across regions here we synthesized edge of field p and sediment runoff data for 30 arable fields in the canadian provinces of saskatchewan manitoba and ontario a total of 216 site years to elucidate spatial and temporal differences in runoff and p mobilization in snowmelt and rainfall runoff and discuss climatic soil and management drivers for these patterns across all regions precipitation inputs were positively correlated with runoff amounts and consequently p loads runoff and p losses were dominated by snowmelt across all sites however regional differences in runoff amounts and p concentrations loads and speciation were apparent proportions of total p in the dissolved form were greater in the prairie region 55 94 in manitoba than in the great lakes region 26 35 in ontario in manitoba dissolved p concentrations in both snowmelt and rainfall runoff were strongly positively correlated to soil olsen p concentrations in the 0 5 cm soil depth however this relationship was not found for ontario fields where tile drainage dominated hydrologic losses although precipitation amounts and runoff volumes were greater in ontario than manitoba some of the greatest p loads were observed from manitoba fields driven by management practices this synthesis highlights the differences across the canadian agricultural regions in p runoff patterns and drivers and suggests the need of co ordinated and standardized monitoring programs to better understand regional differences and inform management graphical abstract phosphorus runoff patterns vary with climatic regions across canada the dissolved p was measured as total dissolved p in mb and dissolved reactive p in sk and on total p was not measured in sk ga1 keywords agricultural management practice climate variability eutrophication nutrient transport water quality watershed management 1 introduction eutrophication is a widespread water quality problem causing algal blooms and fish kills and loss of ecological and economic value in many freshwater lakes around the world in canada for example both lake winnipeg in the west and lake erie in the east have been experiencing severe eutrophication with the frequency and magnitude of algal blooms increasing in the past decade schindler et al 2012 scavia et al 2014 in 2011 lake erie experienced an algal bloom of record setting magnitude michalak et al 2013 and in 2013 lake winnipeg was even named as the world s threatened lake of the year global nature fund 2013 in 2015 the bloom in lake erie broke the scale for algal bloom magnitude having surpassed the 2011 bloom seewer 2015 phosphorus p has long been regarded as a limiting nutrient for freshwater lakes schindler 1977 schindler et al 2016 although p inputs can originate from industrial municipal domestic and natural sources agriculture has been identified as the dominant source of p loading to both lake winnipeg and lake erie as well as many other lakes in canada council of canadian academies 2013 international joint commission 2014 consequently understanding the patterns and drivers of p losses from agricultural soils has become a fundamental research priority for mitigating p losses and maintaining downstream water security in canada almost all canadian crop production regions exist in cold climates i e the d class in the köppen geiger climate classification system peel et al 2007 in cold climate regions snowmelt runoff often plays a dominant role in annual runoff patterns and soil p mobilization and transport can be facilitated by the agronomic biogeochemical and hydrological characteristics found in these regions liu et al 2019a cold climate regions have short crop growing seasons that limit annual water and p consumption by crops in cold months infiltration of snowmelt and rain water on frozen ground is often impeded gray et al 2001 resulting in high snowmelt runoff volumes that represent a large proportion of annual runoff nicholaichuk 1967 glozier et al 2006 elevated p concentrations in runoff can result from freeze thaw of soils and vegetation which mobilize p elliott 2013 cober et al 2019 liu et al 2019c near surface flow paths associated with frozen or wet soils may also elevate p concentration in runoff particularly following p application as manure or fertilizer macrae et al 2007 liu et al 2017 cold conditions pose unique management challenges as fewer options for mitigating p losses exist in these regions as compared to in warmer regions baulch et al 2019 liu et al 2019a in addition cold climate regions still face the same challenges that are associated with rainfall runoff as in warmer regions including soil p management although cold climates are a common characteristic of agricultural fields across the canadian landscape it should be noted that the specific climates field crops and management practices vary widely across canada for example climatologically the canadian prairie region northern portion of the northern great plains region experiences more severe winters and drier summers than the great lakes region which is warmer and more humid crop production in the sub humid or semi arid prairie region is dominated by small grains and canola brassica napus l production whereas crops throughout the great lakes region are dominated by corn zea mays l and soybean glycine max l merr livestock production is found in both regions with dairy prevalent in the great lakes region and beef and hogs more common on the prairies with regards to land management practices subsurface drainage tiles connected to surface drainage ditches are widely used in the great lakes region to alleviate water ponding problems and reduce overland flow but are less common in the drier canadian prairie region where drainage is commonly achieved through surface drains and where soils remain frozen for a longer portion of the year a range of agronomic practices is found across both regions indeed conventional tillage conservation tillage and zero till equivalent to no till all exist within both regions soil p management and balances are variable throughout both regions and among the different production systems within each region reid and schneider 2019 all these variations in climates cropping systems and management practices can contribute to differing magnitudes and patterns of p loss from land to water complicating direct comparisons between regions a comprehensive characterization of magnitudes and variability in p losses from agricultural fields across canada is needed to better contextualize future studies and enable more accurate extrapolation and application of research findings across canada edge of field runoff monitoring is an important approach for collecting water quality data and further relating the data to climate soil and field management conditions as well as field and watershed processes in canada edge of field runoff monitoring has been conducted on a range of climates soils and management practices in saskatchewan manitoba and ontario since the 1960s data for the current study were available for the canadian prairies from saskatchewan and manitoba and for the great lakes region from ontario a large portion of these results have been documented separately in a series of publications e g tiessen et al 2010 2011 li et al 2011 liu et al 2013 2014a 2014b 2019b van esbroeck et al 2016 chen et al 2017 plach et al 2019 schneider et al 2019 wilson et al 2019 however most studies represent a subset of fields or years and the data have not been synthesized with a cross province or cross climate scope thus we synthesized edge of field p losses in runoff from 30 fields monitored during 1995 2017 in saskatchewan manitoba and ontario a total of 216 site years our objectives were to 1 compare p runoff patterns across different geographical and climatic regions 2 identify climatic soil and management drivers for the p runoff patterns and 3 provide insights into future research for agricultural p management and water quality this synthesis has important policy and programming implications for federal provincial and municipal governments 2 materials and methods the 30 fields included in this study extend from swift current 50 15 n 107 43 w in saskatchewan to

large range of management practices fig 1 liu et al submission to dib in this study the overall water quality monitoring period spanned from 1995 to 2017 but the numbers of monitoring years varied with sites depending on data availability in total this study included 216 site years 2 1 field management and monitoring 2 1 1 the swift current fields in saskatchewan swift current sk1 sc is located in a semi arid climate fig 1 with long term mean annual temperature of 4 1 and mean annual precipitation of 360 mm coles et al 2017 the region is characterized by long cold winters short warm summers and approximately 24 of the annual precipitation occurred as snow during 1962 2013 coles et al 2017 long term edge of field monitoring was conducted in three rectangular adjacent fields 4 5 ha each fig 1 by agriculture and agri food canada during 1962 2011 and experiments were designed for evaluating the impacts of crop and tillage management on nutrient and sediment transport mcconkey et al 1997 schneider et al 2019 the original experimental results have been made publically available by mcconkey and thiagarajan 2018 and they were used for calculating seasonal and annual values in the current study the fields are gently sloped 4 and the soil is a swinton loam classified as orthic brown chernozem aridic haploboroll the fields underwent periodic treatments throughout the study period which were described in detail by schneider et al 2019 in this synthesis only the data from 1995 to 2011 were included because the water sampling techniques changed from grab sampling to automated sampling around 1994 during 1995 2011 field 1 sk1 sc f1 had a wheat triticum aestivum l and green manure rotation with conventional tillage and incorporation of crop residues field 2 sk1 sc f2 had a wheat fallow rotation during 1995 2002 and wheat pulse crop rotation during 2003 2011 both with zero till field 3 sk1 sc f3 had a wheat fallow rotation with conventional tillage throughout the study period nitrogen and p fertilizers were applied based on provincial recommendations schneider et al 2019 main management information is summarized in liu et al submission to dib to monitor runoff and water quality the fields were separated by raised grass berms to prevent transfer of flow between them in each field the depth of surface runoff from snowmelt and rain was measured using a stevens water level chart recorder belfort instrument company in the stilling well of a 0 6 m h flume that was installed at the outlet of the field the flumes were heated in cold weather to prevent icing in addition pressure transducers were also used to record water level the water level measurements were converted to daily and hourly flow rates using a rating curve developed for each field cessna et al 2013 water samples 0 5 l each were collected using an automated water sampler isco 3700 portable sampler passed through a no 42 filter paper whatman international and analyzed for dissolved reactive p using the method of hamm et al 1970 suspended sediment was measured as the oven dry weight of the solid remaining on the filter paper each year a series of snow surveys were conducted to measure snow depth and density at different locations in each field and at different times before snowmelt coles et al 2017 the survey data were used to calculate snow water equivalent swe which represents the amount of snow water available for runoff daily rainfall was recorded at a nearby weather station in addition soil test p was determined on samples collected at 0 15 cm depth each fall using the olsen method olsen et al 1954 2 1 2 the kenton carberry south tobacco creek watershed and sanford fields in manitoba in manitoba edge of field water quality monitoring was conducted by agriculture and agri food canada and environment and climate change canada at four different locations kenton mb1 ken 10 fields carberry mb2 car 3 fields the stc watershed mb3 stc 10 fields and sanford mb4 san 1 field fig 1 these locations are identified by the name of the closest town with the exception of the stc location which is named after the watershed because this watershed has been widely reported in literature and the name will be easier for cross referencing at the four locations monitoring periods were 2013 2017 2014 2017 1997 2017 and 2010 2015 respectively all locations have a sub humid continental climate for example the stc watershed has a long term mean annual temperature of 3 and mean annual precipitation of 550 mm and the respective means in sanford are 2 8 and 580 mm all fields are gently sloped with landforms varying from level 2 slope to undulating 2 5 slope soil classification working group 1998 except one field at kenton that has a greater slope 5 7 field size ranged from 1 to 28 ha fig 1 the soils ranged from orthic black chernozems in kenton and carberry and dark gray chernozems in the stc watershed to gleyed humic vertisols in sanford fig 1 the fields were used to study the drivers and the impacts of a large range of management practices on water quality the management practices of crop rotations tillage and nutrient applications for many of the fields have been described in detail in previous reports tiessen et al 2010 li et al 2011 liu et al 2014a 2014b 2019b chen et al 2017 wilson et al 2019 the crop rotations in most fields are dominated by cereals and oilseeds canola and flax while some fields were sown to perennial forages corn hemp cannabis sativa l etc tillage operations ranged from conventional high disturbance tillage to conservation tillage and zero till some fields received no p while others had fertilizer p applications and one field had fertilizer manure and feed p resulting from in field winter bale feeding in kenton in brief all 10 fields mainly grew small grains and canola and in some years hemp and pea pisum sativum l six of the fields mb1 ken f1 mb1 ken f2 mb1 ken f3 mb1 ken f4 mb1 ken f5 and mb1 ken f6 were conventionally tilled and have received beef cattle manure historically but received no p application during the periods of study while the other four fields mb1 ken f7 mb1 ken f8 mb1 ken f9 and mb1 ken f10 had zero till and fertilizer p applications in carberry all three fields grew wheat canola and soybean and received p fertilizers with zero till in mb2 car f1 and conservation tillage in mb2 car f2 and mb2 car f3 in the stc watershed field management practices were more complex than in other locations mb3 stc f1 and mb3 stc f2 had small grains and canola rotations conventional tillage and fertilizer p applications mb3 stc f3 mb3 stc f4 mb3 stc f7 and mb3 stc f9 had periods of both perennial forages zero till and no p and annual crops conventional tillage and fertilizer p and they were paired and used to study impacts of the two cropping systems on water quality liu et al 2014a mb3 stc f10 and mb3 stc f11 were paired fields with the same rotation of small grains and canola but different tillage operations and soil p management strategies tillage methods were contrasted during 1997 2007 conventional tillage in mb3 stc f10 and conservation tillage in mb3 stc f11 moreover both fields received conventional fertilizer p rates during 1997 2005 and reduced p rates during 2006 2017 these allowed to assess the impacts of tillage methods tiessen et al 2010 liu et al 2014b and soil p management liu et al 2019b on water quality mb3 stc f18 and mb3 stc f19 were another set of paired fields where in field winter bale feeding was implemented in mb3 ftc f18 but not in mb3 stc f19 chen

al submission to dib all 24 fields were individually monitored for runoff volume sediment total dissolved p and total p in both snowmelt and rainfall runoff typically levels of runoff were measured with an ultrasonic sensor and recorded with a data logger at a compound angle v notched weir that was installed at the lower edge of the field the water levels were then converted to flow rate at 5 min intervals using a standard v notched weir flow equation smith 1985 automated water samplers sigma autosampler 800sl at each weir were utilized to collect water samples during each runoff event observed at these sites for all water samples the concentrations of sediment total dissolved p and total p were determined in an accredited laboratory using standard methods as described by tiessen et al 2010 or wilson et al 2019 as in swift current snow surveys were conducted each year in most years to obtain swe and daily rainfall was recorded at a weather station in the watershed in most manitoba fields soil olsen p was determined for both 0 5 cm and 5 15 cm soil depths in fall olsen et al 1954 2 1 3 the essex londesborough and ilderton fields in ontario in ontario edge of field water

in van esbroeck et al 2016 2017 lozier et al 2017 and plach et al 2019 and the main management information is summarized in liu et al submission to dib in each field runoff volume dissolved reactive p and total p were monitored in both overland flow and tile drainage the methods for flow monitoring water sampling and chemical analysis have been described in detail by van esbroeck et al 2016 and plach et al 2019 in brief overland flow was monitored using a culvert or drainage pipe on the soil surface and tile flow was measured at 15 min intervals in the tiles using direct measurements of simultaneous velocity and depth hatch flo tote 3 and fl900 data logger water samples in overland flow and tiles were collected using automated samplers iscos teledyne isco 6712 with periodic grab

at an annual time step and runoff p and sediment results are separated into snowmelt and rainfall categories to reflect the contrasting runoff processes rainfall and snowmelt runoff were separated based on the weather record showing if there was a rainfall event in the absence of rainfall any runoff from snow covered ground was attributed to snowmelt runoff on the contrary when there was no snow on the ground and rainfall was observed all runoff was assumed to have been derived from rainfall in the cases when rain on snow occurred which happened less often an accurate separation was hard and arbitrary judgment was made based on the amount of runoff relative to the amount of rainfall i e relative proportions of swe and rainfall to the event overall all p and sediment concentrations in runoff are annual flow weighted mean concentrations box and 3 d plots were made using the origin software origin version 2019 statistical analyses were conducted using sas 9 4 sas institute 2012 a proc univariate procedure was used to test the normality of data correlations between variables were assessed using the pearson s correlation analysis when the data were normally distributed and using the spearman s rank order correlation method for non normally distributed data hauke and kossowski 2011 a significance level of α 0 05 was used throughout the study unless specific p values were given 3 results and discussion in this cross region synthesis we summarized major results of edge of field runoff and p losses in 216 site years and attempted to explain the results using the information of climate landscape soil and field management different aspects of runoff and p loss are discussed for both snowmelt and rainfall runoff in the sections below the seasonal and annual values for individual fields that have been used for plotting the overall patterns of runoff and p loss are summarized in liu et al submission to dib 3 1 snowmelt and rainfall runoff runoff amounts varied widely across the 216 site years and presented clear regional differences for both snowmelt and rainfall runoff as well as annual runoff fig 2a from west to east fig 1 median annual runoff was 10 mm in saskatchewan s swift current 39 65 mm in the manitoba s kenton carberry stc watershed and sanford and 156 383 mm in the ontario s essex londesborough and ilderton fig 2a this reflects a clear climate gradient of the study regions i e semi arid in saskatchewan sub humid in manitoba and humid in ontario in individual site years although the proportion of snowmelt runoff in annual runoff varied from 0 to 100 fig 2b snowmelt runoff contributed an average of 49 or more to annual runoff in every field studied liu et al submission to dib for all site years within the same climate region snowmelt runoff contributed an average of 88 78 and 66 to annual runoff in the semi arid saskatchewan sub humid manitoba and humid ontario respectively these snowmelt contributions are large considering the fact that snowfall or swe accounted for an average of only 15 of annual precipitation over all 216 site years 10 in saskatchewan 18 in manitoba and 16 in ontario the results support previous reports on the dominant role of snowmelt runoff in other cold region watersheds rekolainen et al 1997 little et al 2007 and point to the need to prioritize snowmelt runoff for water quality research in cold climate regions although snowmelt dominated runoff in general it should be noted that rainfall runoff accounted for up to 51 of annual runoff in some fields and that in three of 216 site years rainfall was the only source of runoff thus knowledge and data are needed on both snowmelt and rainfall runoff this is especially important in light of climate change as parts of the canadian prairies are already experiencing increased rainfall driven runoff dumanski et al 2015 the variability in snowmelt and rainfall runoff exists not only across regions but also within the same study region fig 2a for example in the stc watershed where 103 site year data are available annual snowmelt runoff ranged from 0 to 224 mm and annual rainfall runoff ranged from 0 to 114 mm in general runoff amount is largely dependent upon the amount of water that is available for runoff i e precipitation inputs over all site years there was a significant positive correlation between snowmelt runoff and snow inputs measured either as swe in saskatchewan and manitoba or as snowfall in ontario fig 3a a significant but weaker correlation was also found between rainfall runoff and rainfall amounts fig 3b the weaker correlation in rainfall is expected because the contribution of rainfall to runoff is influenced more strongly by antecedent moisture conditions macrae et al 2010 lam et al 2016 which are driven by evapotranspiration interception and infiltration in saskatchewan and manitoba notably nearly 70 of site years had annual rainfall runoff amounts less than 5 mm in contrast annual rainfall runoff in ontario was much greater due to significantly greater rainfall amounts in addition to water availability runoff generation can be affected by landform and soil characteristics buda et al 2009 frozen unfrozen ground gray et al 2001 and management practices van der kamp et al 2003 as these factors vary and interact across fields it is hard to generalize the relative importance of the factors for all site years however some observations are reasonably apparent first all fields have relatively similar sizes and gentle slopes fig 1 thus the influence of landform on runoff generation may be expected to be similar however soil texture ranges from loam to clay across the different fields fig 1 and the extent of ground freezing changes with both regions and years which can have varying impacts on water infiltration and therefore runoff generation despite these differences across all site years it appears that the ratios of snowmelt runoff swe mean 0 64 were much greater than the ratios of rainfall runoff rain mean 0 04 this is largely because snowmelt infiltration is often limited when it occurs on fully or partially frozen ground dumanski et al 2015 or due to limited storage wet antecedent conditions during the non growing season macrae et al 2010 lam et al 2016 management practices can also affect runoff generation through influencing both water availability for runoff and water infiltration for example stubble management can affect snowmelt runoff by influencing snow accumulation through blowing snow processes and snowmelt through impacting surface energy balance harder et al 2019 in both swift current sk1 sc f2 versus sk1 sc f1 and sk1 sc f3 and the stc watershed mb3 stc f11 versus mb3 stc f10 conservation tillage or zero till permits more crop stubble to remain enabling the trapping of more snow which appears to have resulted in greater amounts of snowmelt runoff than conventional tillage in similar cropping systems comparisons between median values show that sk1 sc f2 had 12 17 mm more snowmelt runoff than sk1 sc f1 and sk1 sc f3 over 1995 2011 and mb3 stc f11 had 9 mm more snowmelt runoff than mb3 stc f10 over 1997 2007 drainage management affects water infiltration and runoff in fields tile drainage particularly affects runoff partitioning between surface and subsurface pathways however the efficacy of tiles in runoff partitioning differs across regions with different climates in ontario where 79 91 of annual precipitation occurred as rainfall and relatively warm temperatures allowed water infiltration during winters tile drainage accounted for 80 of total runoff in all 14 site years plach et al 2019 in contrast in manitoba tile drainage only accounted for 11 28 of annual runoff because most runoff occurred during snowmelt when fields were frozen kokulan et al 2019 3 2 phosphorus and sediments in snowmelt and rainfall runoff total p concentrations and loads in runoff varied widely with fields and years fig 2c d across all 216 site years annual flow weighted mean concentrations of total p ranged from 0 06 to 2 62 mg l 1 fig 2c and annual total p loads ranged from 0 01 2 50 kg ha 1 fig 2d notably neither the highest total p concentration nor load was found in ontario fig 2c d despite the fact that it had the greatest annual runoff amounts fig 2a the ontario fields were tile drained which likely helped to retain p in soils by routing surface runoff through the subsurface although tile drains have been shown to exacerbate p losses at the edge of field in some studies king et al 2015 subsoils have been shown to be able to retain p in other studies e g plach et al 2018a 2018b some of the greatest total p loads and concentrations were found in manitoba fields fig 4 where in field winter bale feeding added manure and feed p to runoff i e mb3 stc f18 where conservation tillage or zero till built up soil test p in the surface soils e g mb1 ken f9 mb1 ken f10 and mb3 stc f11 and where perennial forages elevated p concentrations in snowmelt runoff through serving as a vegetative p source and stratification of p occurred in the surface soil e g mb3 stc f3 and mb3 stc f9 overall snowmelt runoff dominated total p loss in all regions fig 2e with the average contribution ranging from 52 to 100 across the fields liu et al submission to dib in 132 out of 166 site years where total p was measured snowmelt contributed over 50 of annual total p loss in snowmelt runoff specifically annual flow weighted mean concentrations of total p ranged from 0 06 to 3 14 mg l 1 excluding years with no snowmelt runoff and annual total p loads ranged from 0 to 2 15 kg ha 1 fig 2 c d in contrast rainfall runoff concentrations and loads of total p ranged from 0 02 to 5 37 mg l 1 excluding years with no rainfall runoff and from 0 to 1 40 kg ha 1 respectively fig 2c d overall the pattern of dissolved p concentrations in relation to regions fig 2f was similar to that of total p fig 2c there is a stark contrast between manitoba fields and ontario fields in terms of proportion of dissolved p in total p fig 2g for annual runoff the average proportion of total dissolved p in total p for each field ranged 55 94 in manitoba whereas the proportion of dissolved reactive p in total p in ontario fields ranged 26 35 liu et al submission to dib these regional differences are not a result of the analysis of different p species i e tdp in mb and drp in on as a sub set of samples showed that drp accounted for the majority 90 of tdp in most of the samples across both regions unpublished data the dominance of dissolved p in manitoba is attributed to its gently sloped landform structural stability of chernozemic soils and frozen soils in winter for which soil erosion by water is generally low indeed annual sediment load was smaller than 0 25 mg ha 1 in 140 out of 150 manitoba site years fig 2h in saskatchewan s swift current fields total p was not measured and thus the proportion of dissolved p in total p is unknown but the proportion is likely high as found in many other prairie sites e g tiessen et al 2010 liu et al 2013 like manitoba the saskatchewan fields also had generally gentle slopes and low soil erosion and annual sediment load in 46 out of 50 site years was smaller than 0 25 mg ha 1 fig 2h in ontario in contrast although all sites also had gentle slopes p loads were dominated by the particulate p fractions indicating that erosive processes were occurring both in the surface and subsurface in both manitoba and ontario interestingly ratios of dissolved p to total p in rainfall runoff was positively correlated with the ratios in snowmelt runoff fig 5 even so it should be noted that the distribution of data points was clearly clustered by province with manitoba having generally greater dissolved p total p ratios in both snowmelt and rainfall runoff than ontario fig 5 across all site years in the provinces the average proportions of dissolved p were 79 for snowmelt runoff and 73 for rainfall runoff in manitoba and 31 for snowmelt runoff and 30 for rainfall runoff in ontario as demonstrated in fig 4 p runoff from land is driven by climate soil p concentrations and management practices that affect p source transport or both these drivers are respectively discussed in the sections below 3 2 1 climate impacts on phosphorus runoff across all sites both dissolved p and total p loads in snowmelt and rainfall runoff increased significantly with precipitation inputs fig 6 in all cases nonetheless the patterns of p loss are apparently clustered by regions with generally similar seasonal climates saskatchewan and manitoba had similar p runoff patterns which was contrasted by ontario that had much greater precipitation inputs throughout the study period but relatively smaller amounts of dissolved p losses in snowmelt runoff tests with the spearman s rank order correlation method showed that the inclusion of the ontario data weakened the correlation between p loss and snow water for both dissolved p and total p this is probably due to the fact that the ontario fields are tile drained which have affected edge of field p loss as discussed above in general the correlation between rainfall runoff p and rain water was much weaker than that between snowmelt p loss and snow water fig 6c versus fig 6a fig 6d versus fig 6b as discussed above generation of runoff derived from rainfall is affected by many hydrological and agronomic factors that affect dynamic water balance on the soil surface as a result no or little rainfall runoff occurred in saskatchewan and manitoba over many years with a wide range of annual rainfall amounts to better understand the relationship between rainfall amount and runoff volume and thus runoff p load further analyses should be conducted at an event level 3 2 2 soil test phosphorus and phosphorus runoff as discussed above p source is key to p loss in both snowmelt runoff and rainfall runoff across the 30 fields included in this study all except mb3 stc 18 in field winter bale feeding and on2 ild f1 manure applications received chemical p fertilizers as the only p additions during the monitoring period or no p additions at all in some years including all monitoring years for each field mean annual p application rate ranged from 0 to 18 kg ha 1 in saskatchewan and manitoba where crop rotations are dominated by small grains canola and forage crops in corn and soybean dominated ontario in contrast mean annual p application rates for each field ranged from 23 to 41 kg ha 1 the varying p inputs and soil tillage methods have resulted in differing soil olsen p concentrations in both 0 5 cm and 0 15 cm soil depths across the study fields liu et al submission to dib in a previous study synthesizing 57 recent site year data in manitoba wilson et al 2019 found that the soil olsen p concentration in the 0 5 cm soil depth was a significant predictor of dissolved p concentrations in snowmelt runoff our synthesis with an even larger dataset supports the finding of wilson et al 2019 and shows that in manitoba fields dissolved p concentrations in both snowmelt and rainfall runoff were strongly positively correlated with soil olsen p concentrations in the 0 5 cm soil depth fig 7 however it should be noted that the ontario fields do not follow the same relationship as manitoba again this is likely because the ontario fields were tile drained and the dissolved form of p originating from surface soils may be well retained in the soil profile while leaching to the subsurface layers plach et al 2018a 2018b it is also important to note that dissolved species of p are not the dominant fraction of p exported in ontario as particulate p represents the majority of p transported thus the weaker correlations between dissolved p and olsen p may reflect differences in transport mechanisms indeed duncan et al 2017 and pease et al 2018 observed substantial variability in relationships between soil p and runoff p in ohio and attributed this to differences in hydrology 3 2 3 management impacts on phosphorus runoff management practices synthesized varied widely in the study provinces although saskatchewan and manitoba had some common practice comparisons with regards to different tillage methods and different cropping systems there is a lack of common practice pairs between the prairie provinces and ontario as a result it is difficult to conduct management focused cross region comparisons based on the synthesized data however the synthesis has clearly shown that some management practices such as in field winter bale feeding zero or conservation tillage soil p management and perennial crops greatly affected p runoff in the prairies which may have relevance to ontario in the prairie region in field winter bale feeding is a common practice for beef production although the practice helps to build up soil fertility and save costs of transporting manure high losses of p in runoff from feeding fields also raise concerns over water quality chen et al 2017 our synthesis shows that the manitoba bale feeding field mb3 stc 18 had the greatest total p loss in both snowmelt and rainfall runoff among all the fields fig 4 which confirms animal agriculture as a hotspot for p losses in agricultural watersheds in ontario although winter bale feeding is not common other manure management challenges exist for example although the application of manure on frozen fields is strongly discouraged it is still periodically done when manure is applied to frozen ground it can considerably increase p loss in snowmelt runoff macrae et al 2007 these results indicate that the presence of manure on fields in winter consistently elevates p losses from fields and that this occurs across all of the study regions indeed winter manure management should be prioritized for managing p losses in the last several decades conservation tillage and zero till practices have increased dramatically across canada lobb et al 2007 although these practices were put in place to reduce erosion and p losses from fields this has led to unintended consequences in some landscapes for example in the canadian prairies where soil erosion is relatively mild and p loss is often dominated by dissolved p in snowmelt runoff reduced tillage appears to consistently increase p loss in paired manitoba fields tiessen et al 2010 found greater dissolved p and total p losses in reduced tillage systems than in conventional high disturbance tillage mb3 stc f10 versus mb3 stc f11 1997 2007 because reduced tillage permitted the build up and stratification of p in surface soils and also retained more snow cover leading to increased runoff the greatest p stratification was found when reduced tillage is combined with high rates of fertilizer p addition wilson et al 2019 in saskatchewan schneider et al 2019 found that a conversion from conventional tillage to zero till consistently increased snowmelt runoff and dissolved p losses sk1 sc f2 versus sk1 sc f3 1995 2002 thus although the magnitudes of p losses differ substantially between the semi arid saskatchewan and sub humid manitoba the present synthesis has shown that the relative effects of tillage on snowmelt p losses are similar across these regions liu et al submission to dib in contrast to the consistent effects of conservation tillage on p loss in the prairies the effects of reduced tillage in the great lakes region are not consistent unfortunately the current dataset does not permit a statistical comparison of the impacts of tillage across study regions however some qualitative conclusions can be drawn from the dataset and the existing literature both hydrological and p transport processes appear to differ across different regions within the great lakes region plach et al 2019 macrae et al 2021 in some regions of ontario p losses in surface runoff exceed p losses in tile drainage whereas in other regions e g southwestern ontario northwestern ontario tiles account for a more significant amount of p losses king et al 2015 plach et al 2019 macrae et al 2021 across the great lakes region total p losses are dominated by particulate p losses although to a greater extent in the undulating fields and watersheds to the northeast of lake erie north of lake ontario and east of lake huron macrae et al 2021 here reduced tillage is anticipated to play a more significant role in reducing total p loss than in manitoba and saskatchewan indeed one ontario study reported that conservation tillage reduced sediment and organic p losses from manured fields relative to a conventional till and had no effect on dissolved reactive p losses coelho et al 2012 another ontario study showed that tillage did not affect p losses in tile drainage in a sandy loam soil lam et al 2016 in contrast no till was reported to increase p losses in tile drainage in northwestern ohio king et al 2015 jarvie et al 2017 thus tillage appears to have different impacts on p loss across the canadian regions and it can also have variable impacts on p losses within a region such as the great lakes region crops affect p runoff through influencing soil p and water balances and dynamics in cold agricultural regions moreover crops can become a source of p loss from land to water liu et al 2019c when plant cells and tissues are damaged by freeze thaw events and consequently release p jones 1992 this process has likely contributed to p in snowmelt runoff in all fields synthesized here as they are all located in cold regions where winter crops or crop residues are exposed to repeated freeze thaw cycles however the vegetative p contributions to runoff is expected to be different for the prairie region and for ontario in the prairies liu et al 2014a and schneider et al 2019 have shown that perennial forages and green manure significantly increased annual flow weighted mean concentrations of dissolved p in snowmelt runoff as compared to annual crops and summer fallow respectively sk1 sc f1 versus sk1 sc f3 mb3 stc f3 versus mb3 stc f4 and mb3 stc f7 versus mb3 stc f9 although crops can have multiple impacts on p runoff and the impacts are complicated when crop factors interact with other management practices such as tillage and p input rates studies have suggested that vegetation at least accounts for part of snowmelt p runoff in the prairie region elliott 2013 in ontario in contrast it appears that vegetation does not exacerbate p loss at the same magnitude as in the prairies indeed cober et al 2019 found that p concentrations did not differ between cover cropped and bare plots on a field lozier et al 2017 found that p losses at the edge of the field were less than the p released from plants and argued that any p lost from plants was retained on fields this indicates that the efficacy of cover crops and residues and their risk of unintended consequences appears to differ regionally across canada 3 3 implications on future research currently there is a lack of synthesis of cross region water quality research in canada our effort has been challenged by the inconsistency of experimental treatments and monitored parameters in different provinces and regions largely because edge of field monitoring is costly and often constrained by the availability of research funds and labor for example the impacts of livestock grazing perennial forages and soil p management on water quality have not been studied in saskatchewan and ontario as intensively as in manitoba in addition sediment loss was measured in saskatchewan and manitoba but not in ontario and the dissolved form of p in runoff was measured as dissolved reactive p in saskatchewan but as total dissolved p potentially containing dissolved organic p in addition to dissolved reactive p in manitoba all these have challenged comparisons in management impacts among the provinces however this study points to the importance of co ordinated and standardized cross region water quality monitoring programs to comprehensively understand the science behind our observations this is especially important in the context of climate change for which co ordinated and standardized cross regional monitoring programs will help to contextualize research findings into future climates indeed annual mean temperature annual precipitation and daily extreme precipitation are all projected to increase across canada over the next 80 years bush and lemmen 2019 which will impact the climatic drivers for nutrient transport and confound the efficacies of beneficial management practices this study also demonstrates the importance of exploring innovative practices to manage soil p tillage crop residue cover crops and livestock to minimize p losses however it demonstrates that the efficacy of different management practices may differ across regions for example conservation tillage may reduce p losses in some regions e g ontario but exacerbate p losses in others manitoba cover crops may be problematic for winter p losses in the prairie region but have little effect on winter p loss in the great lakes region soil p management is a key issue as it is closely related to both water quality and food security this synthesis has highlighted that runoff p concentrations increase with increasing soil test p concentrations across the study regions thus more research is needed to identify measures that can reduce soil p concentrations to improve water quality without impacting crop productivity in addition although the impact of in field winter bale feeding was assessed in one field only it consistently resulted in the largest runoff p concentrations among all fields indeed opportunities exist to manage winter manure to mitigate p losses and more research on livestock production systems is generally needed in canada there are many industry and government directives recommendations for management practices to reduce p losses from agricultural land such as government best management practices extension documents and environmental farm plan workbooks municipal watershed management plans and industry sector codes of practice however concerns have arisen with regards to the consistencies and inconsistencies of these directives recommendations as they are often based on blanket applications resulting from the lack of good scientific information and they have not sufficiently considered the differences and similarities in the drivers controlling p losses across regions again co ordinated and standardized monitoring programs should be used to ensure the efficacy of management practices are appropriately evaluated and best practices are implemented across canada to address the current and future climate challenges 4 conclusions both the canadian prairie and the great lakes regions face increasing challenges in reducing p loads to freshwater lakes at present however there is a paucity of cross regional comparisons this synthesis of a large dataset in saskatchewan manitoba and ontario demonstrates some similarities and differences in runoff and p loss patterns between the two regions although the climate drivers and precipitation amounts and forms differ across the regions total p loads from fields are generally within the same range 2 5 kg ha 1 in all cases snowmelt dominates annual p budgets but to a greater extent in the prairies than in the great lakes region the predominant form of p differs across canada with most losses in a dissolved form in the prairie region and most as particulate p in the great lakes region this spatial difference is observed for both snowmelt and rainfall runoff the difference in the dominant p forms suggests that different beneficial management practices may be needed to reduce dissolved p and particulate p losses in the two regions respectively although the ontario sites had much greater snow and rain inputs throughout the study period the largest total p losses were found in some of the manitoba fields where winter bale feeding fertilizer inputs with zero or conservation tillage and perennial crops built up soil test p concentrations in the surface soils and or provided additional p sources this highlights the importance of reducing p sources in mitigating p runoff while soil test p is a strong indicator of the risk of p runoff loss in the prairies it appears to need to be complimented by considering additional factors in predicting p loss in ontario moreover the synthesis suggests the need of co ordinated and standardized monitoring programs to better understand regional differences and inform management in both the canadian prairie and
