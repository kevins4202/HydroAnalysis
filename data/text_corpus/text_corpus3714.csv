18570,the newly emerged microplasma uv radiating technology can be a viable alternative to conventional radiation sources for uv water treatment the capability of the microplasma uv lamp to monochromatically irradiate various wavelengths with different pulsation frequencies in a flat form opens new pathways for the development of novel uv based water purifiers this study is the first to systematically examine the microplasma uv lamp and develop a robust experimental method and apparatus for its operation to study the kinetics of both microbial and chemical pollutant degradation the microplasma uv lamp was characterized in terms of its radiation profile and the impact of operating parameters on the lamp radiant power output it was shown to be an instant on and fast stabilized source the radiant power output was a linear function of the electrical current and was not influenced by the lamp operating temperature and intermittent on off cycles a protocol was developed for obtaining reliable kinetic data for uv induced elimination of microorganisms and micropollutants an experimental setup was proposed for the kinetic studies where the characteristics of the incident irradiance of the lamp including uniformity collimation and divergence were quantitatively evaluated in addition the water factor wf for calculating the average fluence rate was redefined for both the transient and steady state conditions this modification is essential to account for changes in the uv transmittance of the medium which could be an important factor for kinetic study of chemical contaminants two studied cases of microbial direct inactivation and the chemical photo initiated oxidation process in different setups based on the developed protocol confirmed the reproducibility of the fluence based kinetic data independent of the reactor size the proposed protocol can be applied to the kinetic study of the elimination of microbial and chemical contaminants using microplasma uv lamps of any size power and peak wavelength graphical abstract image 1 keywords ultraviolet uv microplasma characterization protocol water treatment 1 introduction ultraviolet uv water disinfection has been a fast growing technology over the past decades thanks to its chemical freeness low by product formation tendency and absence of overdosing risk song et al 2016 moreover uv can degrade organic compounds by uv based advanced oxidation processes assisted by the addition of oxidants nihemaiti et al 2018 or photosensitizing agents such as photocatalysts bararpour et al 2018 the main uv radiation sources employed in the municipal disinfection or advanced oxidation installations are mercury vapor uv lamps however these lamps contain a considerable quantity of mercury which leads to a significant amount of hazardous material after the lamp s lifespan pirnie et al 2006 other challenges associated with mercury lamps are long warm up time filament distortion and geometrical restrictions for the reactor design autin et al 2013 chevremont et al 2013 more recently uv light emitting diode uv led technology has emerged as an alternative for conventional sources and attracted attention because it has no mercury usage low energy consumption compactness and no warm up time matafonova and batoev 2018 song et al 2019 the unique features of uv leds make them a great candidate for point of use water purification systems to be implemented in remote areas taghipour 2013 however relatively low radiant power of the present uvc leds has impeded their progress for large scale applications microcavity plasma or microplasma uv is a new radiation technology that offers some advantages over current uv generating sources the flat thin microplasma uv lamps are driven by at least two interlaced arrays of tiny cavities microcavities with distinct dimensions fabricated into the interior surface of the lamp park et al 2017 in this mercury free technology a rare gas occupies the volume inside the lamp and is in contact with the microcavity array by turning on the lamp the voltage interacts with the gas such that a spatially uniform plasma is formed and confined within the microcavities this is the microplasma this microplasma produces uv generating rare gas excimer molecules which emit radiation in the deep uv spectral region becker et al 2006 to date available microplasma uv lamps use xe2 krcl and xecl excimers to monochromatically radiate at 172 222 and 308 nm peak wavelengths respectively and phosphor for a broad spectrum of 220 280 nm park et al 2016 the presence of the microcavities improves the power output and efficiency of the lamp by at least a factor of two compared with the previous sources for the mentioned peak wavelengths park et al 2017 additionally the planar geometry of these lamps helps them to emit collimated and spatially uniform beams these lamps possess a great potential to create new opportunities for the development of planar uv photoreactors for fluid treatment applications for any newly emerging radiation source a standardized technique is required for the operation characterization and controlling of the radiation performance for the mercury uv lamps several practical procedures for output characterizations have been previously suggested and adopted as the standard by the international ultraviolet association iuva lawal et al 2008 sasges and robinson 2005 as for uv leds a distinct characterization protocol has been recently proposed for investigating the effects of operational conditions and measurement techniques kheyrandish et al 2017 in addition to the characterization protocol a comprehensive protocol must be established for a uv radiation source to design appropriate apparatuses to facilitate obtaining accurate and consistent photo chemical kinetic data which could be applied for the reactor design for uv induced reactions the most accurate way to present the kinetic data is as a function of uv fluence received by the solution components bolton et al 2015b for precise determination of the average fluence rate inside a solution uniform radiation distribution should be obtained this is possible whenever a uniform irradiation field on the solution surface is provided by collimating a set of vertically projected beams in this regard for uv lamps the designing approach of standard setups referred to as collimated beams has been proposed and accepted by the iuva bolton et al 2015a bolton and linden 2003 similarly for uv leds a new method has been recently developed by systematically revising the uv lamp protocol considering the unique characteristics of uv leds kheyrandish et al 2018a however the proposed protocols for uv lamps and uv leds cannot be extended to microplasma uv lamps because the radiation source structure and the technology of uv emission are completely different the present study aimed to develop a protocol for designing appropriate apparatuses to accurately investigate the kinetics and mechanisms of uv induced reactions which will be applicable to microplasma uv lamps of any intensity size and peak wavelength as the primary stage a comprehensive characterization methodology was proposed for the microplasma uv lamp in a non uv absorbing medium this was achieved by introducing the lamp specifications and investigating the effect of operating parameters such as lamp temperature and electrical current on the lamp power output furthermore a special method was devised for studying the microplasma uv lamp incident irradiance pattern finally after conducting systematic quantitative uniformity evaluation que quantitative collimation evaluation qce and quantitative divergence evaluation qde tests on the incident irradiation a protocol was proposed for obtaining uniform radiation distribution inside solutions irradiated by the microplasma uv for use in kinetic studies two uv induced cases were also presented to evaluate the reproducibility of the kinetic data in two distinct protocol based setup configurations for uv inactivation of escherichia coli as a representative for microorganisms and uv h2o2 degradation of methylene blue mb as a model organic contaminant 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials potassium iodate kio3 potassium iodide ki sodium tetraborate decahydrate na2b4o7 10h2o and mb c16h18cln3s were all supplied by sigma aldrich with no further purifications hydrogen peroxide solution h2o2 30 w w was acquired from the fisher scientific co e coli atcc 11229 was obtained from american type culture collection atcc manassas va usa and cultivated following the supplier s product data sheet all agents used in this study were analytical grade and all solutions apart from microbial suspensions were prepared with deionized water 2 2 lamp characterization method a 2 2 in2 microplasma uv lamp with an active illuminating area of about 16 cm2 was acquired from eden park illumination inc the utilized microplasma uv lamp is shown in fig 1 along with the electrical circuit for supplying power to the lamp the lamp was connected to an analog dc power supply model aim tti ex355r so that the input voltage and current could be controlled lamp temperature and flowing electrical current were considered as operational conditions and were studied over irradiation time the effect of intermittent on off cycles was also investigated as another important characteristic of a radiation source the output of a radiation source is usually presented by two groups of specifications which are related to the irradiant power of the source and the spectral power distribution spd of the beams in the first group the incident irradiance from the lamp on a given surface was studied the important values included the following absolute irradiance at the peak wavelength absolute peak irradiance api the integrated irradiance over the radiation spectrum integrated total irradiance iti and irradiance over the germicidal spectrum of 200 300 nm integrated germicidal irradiance igi in the second group of lamp specifications peak wavelength full width at half maximum fwhm and germicidal to total irradiance ratio gtir of the emitted beams were evaluated 2 2 1 domain determination method typically to study the irradiance received by surfaces in front of a radiation source a method is required for dividing the total domain into certain constituent sub domains sds radiometry measurements can be operated on the determined sds to estimate the average irradiance on the domain assuming the radiating surface of the commercial flat microplasma uv lamp as a 2d square it consists of many circular arcs with two diameters of 2 11 mm and 0 71 mm these arcs are positioned side by side so a small arc is adjacent to four larger arcs in four cartesian directions and vice versa fig 2 b the main nonuniformity in the pattern of arcs is an arc empty corner and a spacer at the center of the lamp where a set of the mentioned arcs are absent although the lamp face is square shaped a circular domain for radiant characterization is preferred so that it can be applied to the standard solution containers used for photokinetic studies which usually have circular surfaces petri dishes beakers etc the recommended method is described in fig 2 in which each sd is in front of a circular area of the lamp face with a diameter of 5 26 mm and contains 4 small and 4 large 4 4 arcs 4 microcavity sds in most cases to evaluate the effects of the abovementioned nonuniformities on the irradiance there are some sds in front of circles which contain 3 3 arcs 3 microcavity sds 2 2 arcs 2 microcavity sds and 0 0 arcs 0 microcavity sds each domain circles 1 to 4 contain 8 n 1 sds where n is the circle number this domain determination method can be extended for lamps of any size radiation pattern and viewing angle because it is based on the lamp s inherent structure that is the square shape and the two sizes of tiny microcavities furthermore the method provides the capability of conducting the irradiance uniformity evaluation tests for different solution container sizes by using the domains larger than the lamp e g circle 4 in fig 2 a 2 2 2 radiometry a radiometry configuration was fabricated to measure the incident irradiance distribution on a plane using a detector spectral irradiance was measured with an ocean optics usb2000 spectrometer equipped with a sony ilx511b ccd detector the detecting instrument has a measurement range of 200 850 nm with a resolution of 0 38 nm to obtain more accurate radiometry data on the determined sds the area exposed to radiation was controlled using two methods partially masking the detector wide sensor and a using fiber optic probe in addition since the radiation profile of uv sources is directional the detector was equipped with a cosine corrector with spectralon diffusing material to ensure that the measured number was the normal vector of the incident photon to the surface according to the definition of irradiance for more details see text s1 2 2 3 actinometry chemical actinometry a photochemical method widely used to determine the photon flow entering a solution was applied to determine the fluence rate due to the high absorption coefficient of the actinometer in the uvc region the photons are fully absorbed in a very thin layer less than 1 mm on the top of the solution thus the measured fluence rate with the chemical actinometry is assumed as the fluence rate on the solution surface ki kio3 actinometry which is appropriate to be used for a monochromatic lamp in the deep uvc region was applied the actinometry measurement was performed with 0 1 m kio3 0 6 m ki and 0 01 m na2b4o7 10h2o solution following the standard procedure proposed in the literature by considering all the correction factors for fluence calculation on the solution surface bolton et al 2011 although the microplasma uv lamp is a well monochromatic source the quantum yield of the iodide iodate actinometry was corrected based on the spd as it is a very sensitive function of the wavelength goldstein and rabani 2008 to prevent any systematic errors the container was completely filled with actinometry solution to avoid wall reflectance and was stirred 30 s before each experiment to provide well mixing conditions 2 3 evaluation tests for the protocol development in this protocol three systematic evaluation tests were proposed to increase the accuracy of in solution fluence rate calculation by providing uniform radiation distribution inside the solutions in the que test the distribution of the incident irradiance across the circular surface was evaluated to find a distance where the irradiance was distributed uniformly enough petri factor pf and coefficient of variation cv are represented as statistical parameters in the literature for quantitatively analyzing irradiance uniformity bolton and linden 2003 kheyrandish et al 2018a the pf is described as the ratio of the average incident irradiance over the surface to the irradiance at the center the cv is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of the incident irradiance values to their mean value a minimum pf of 0 9 and a maximum cv of 6 7 are reported to be appropriate for uniformity assurance for the microplasma uv system the pf and cv variables were calculated using the measured irradiance data on various sds to evaluate irradiance uniformity see section 2 2 1 delivered beams to a planar surface may not all be parallel and perpendicularly incident this could cause radiation gradients and reflections to be created nonuniformly inside the solution leading to the setup incompetency for reliable kinetic study to quantitatively investigate the extent of collimation a collimation factor cf is applied which is equal to the ratio of the delivered irradiance to the fluence rate over the surface where a cf 1 means complete collimation in the qce test we calculated cf along the distance from the microplasma uv lamp 0 10 cm to achieve satisfactory collimation where cf 0 99 qde is conducted due to the divergence of the beam as it passes through the depth of the solution container leading to the existence of a radiation gradient in this regard divergence factor df was evaluated for solutions irradiated by the microplasma uv lamp which is defined as the ratio of the average radiation inside the empty container to its value on the surface df was calculated based on an equation describing its definition eq 1 by measuring the delivered radiation at different depths of the container with a 0 2 cm step size and integrating it throughout the total depth 1 cm 1 d f d d l e x d x l e d where d cm is the distance between the lamp and container surface and l cm is the container depth with dx as its step size when the point source assumption can be made for the radiation source the following simplified equation can be used 2 d f d d l hence the qdf test can be used to find the minimum distance from the microplasma uv lamp where the point source assumption becomes valid the abovementioned factors were measured for different solution containing vessel sizes to propose a general protocol for designing quasi collimated apparatuses 2 4 uv degradation experiments as an example of the uv disinfection process inactivation of the e coli bacterium was studied as one of the most commonly used surrogates for enteric pathogens details of stock preparation cell culturing and colony enumerating methods are described in text s2 the initial density of e coli for each disinfection experiment was set to 106 cfu ml 1 additionally a uv hydrogen peroxide system was selected as a common uv based photo initiated oxidation degradation of mb was measured as a well known model organic contaminant because its concentration can easily be calculated by measuring the absorbance of the solution at 664 nm with a uv vis ible spectrophotometer using the beer lambert law the actual inactivation and degradation experiments were conducted in bench scale collimated and uniformly irradiated which was ensured by the developed protocol and the uv apparatuses equipped with a 2 2 in2 microplasma uv lamp emitting radiation nominally at 222 nm the reaction solution was put into two quartz cylindrical containers with inner diameters of 5 5 cm and 1 8 cm respectively and depth of 1 cm and placed on a stir plate perpendicular to the incident radiation a black sheet with an aperture was put on top of the container so that the beams entered the solution only from the container surface rather than the walls this is particularly crucial when the container size is smaller than the lamp a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig s1 the entire apparatus was covered by a black box during the experiment to avoid any potential photodegradation or photoreactivation by the ambient light 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of microplasma uv the measured spd of the studied microplasma uv lamp is presented in fig s2 the fwhm of the 221 nm microplasma uv lamp emission spectrum was around 3 nm which confirmed the monochromatic source assumption for this source gtir of the spectrum was about 0 92 based on the relative irradiation values which was much higher than the one for the medium pressure mercury lamps commonly used in microbial inactivation applications this showed that the source emitted much less photoreactivation initiating radiation photoreactivation phenomenon is a molecular mechanism in which bacterial enzymes compensate for dna damages induced by germicidal uvc by absorbing uva 315 380 nm and visible light song et al 2019 3 1 1 radiation pattern a clear qualitative observation of the radiation distribution on planes in various distances from the microplasma uv lamp is illustrated in optical images in fig 3 it can be understood that although the microplasma uv lamp had a square face the radiation mostly had a circular radiation profile with higher intensities at the center and lower ones at the edges fig 4 a shows the pattern of the igi values over the distance from the microplasma uv lamp on nine sds inside the circle 1 domain equal values were observed for the measured irradiances on eight sds with same decreasing pattern along the distance there were only tiny divergences at very close distances from the lamp which would be due to the existent noises and errors for detector measurements at the near field readings kheyrandish et al 2018b however on the centric sd the irradiance values significantly increased 135 from 0 to 0 4 cm and then decreased similar to those of the other sds this is because of the absence of microcavities at the center of the lamp the pattern of delivered radiation to adjacent sds in a row is analyzed in fig 4 b for a set of four sds see fig 4 d for sd locations the resultant patterns demonstrated lower incident irradiance on near edge locations in addition sd4 which was outside of the lamp size surface showed a different pattern maximum value at a distance other than 0 in comparison with sd1 to sd3 similar to the centric sd but with considerably lower values this showed that although the areas outside the lamp surface still received irradiance the nonuniformities would be significant on a container with a larger surface area than the lamp up to a distance of about 6 cm from the lamp four types of sds were based on the number of constituent microcavities 0 2 3 and 4 interestingly the radiometry results on the lamp surface showed that irradiance on 3 microcavity and 2 microcavity sds were nearly 3 4 and 1 2 of that on a 4 microcavity sd respectively see fig 4 c distance 0 by increasing the distance from the lamp however the abovementioned ratios were not observed among the delivered radiations on four types of sds due to the cumulative effect of adjacent irradiating microcavities on each other from a distance of about 6 cm all sds were almost equally irradiated which could lead to a uniform radiation distribution on larger sized containers in front of the microplasma uv lamps similar observations can be seen on the cross sectional optical images in fig 3 3 1 2 effect of lamp temperature the irradiance received on a random 4 microcavity sd was studied in 1 s intervals over 8 min of illumination to evaluate the effect of lamp running time and temperature on its output specifications fig 5 shows a sample of resultant data at a 1 cm distance from the lamp the same patterns were observed at other distances the lamp started illuminating instantly when it was plugged into an electrical source that is no warm up time was required due to the lamp s mercury free design the irradiance dramatically increased in the first 15 s of irradiating with no significant change in the lamp temperature afterward although the temperature increased from the ambient temperature to 40 c the received irradiance increased relatively negligibly 3 after 15 s and below 1 after 60 s with regard to all absolute and integrated irradiances this phenomenon revealed that providing a short 15 s stabilization time was enough to reach to a fairly constant maximum output it was significantly shorter than the reported physical warm up time for uv lamps and stabilization time for uv led kheyrandish et al 2017 mcdermott et al 2008 while pursuing the reason for this stabilization time it was observed that the flowing electrical current through the lamp circuit increased in the first 15 s and remained almost constant after that according to ohm s law in a constant input voltage this change in current showed that the system resistance decreased in the first 15 s thus providing a cooling system for the lamp powering circuit would be helpful for increasing power delivering efficiencies and decreasing the required stabilization time the intrinsic instant on and fast stabilized full output characteristics of the microplasma uv lamp are crucial factors in using this uv radiation source for designing industrial scale photoreactors with intermittence flow fig 5 b demonstrates the effect of lamp temperature on the lamp spd specifications as there was almost no change in their values during the studied 8 min of irradiation in spite of the significant temperature increase although it was found that lamp temperature did not affect its output specifications in the studied range raising of the temperature to very high values may be detrimental to the lamp either suddenly burning microcavities or gradually reducing the lamp s effective lifetime hence using a fan or any simple thermal management device is recommended to dissipate the generated heat and control the lamp temperature 3 1 3 effect of electrical current a range of operating current from 0 1 a to the maximum allowable value was tested using a digital dc power supply as with any other electrical device there is a maximum allowable operating voltage for the microplasma uv lamp which was set by the manufacturer 12v for the lamp studied here proportional to 0 65 a current a higher electrical current may alter the temperature increasing rate of the microplasma uv lamp therefore in order to independently investigate the effect of current a constant temperature rising rate was maintained using a cooling fan the irradiance was measured after it attained a stabilized value based on what was described in section 3 1 2 as depicted in fig 6 b spd related specifications of the emitted radiation showed no significant variation from increasing the electrical current in the safe allowable range furthermore in the studied current range the over distance incident irradiance pattern on different locations sds was not affected and similar patterns as illustrated in fig 4 were observed however all absolute and integrated irradiance values on an sd were considerably affected by changing the electrical current fig 6 a this functionality can be extended to all sds since the relative radiation pattern was not altered by modifying the electrical current linear relations were observed between the electrical current and all the studied peak absolute and integrated irradiances ultimately these linear trendlines could be utilized as a calibration curve to provide appropriate irradiances in a microplasma uv apparatus by adjusting the input current or conversely measuring the unknown irradiance inside a photoreactor by simply controlling the flowing current note that delivering overvoltage values would have destructive effects on the lamp by either causing significant damage to the lamp possibly burning it out or decreasing lamp lifespan by degrading the window material hence lower currents are recommended to extend the efficient lifespan to 10 000 h on the other hand running a lamp on a very low voltage therefore with less light output may extend its operating life but is not an enhancement to efficiency 3 1 4 effect of intermittent on off cycles conventional uv lamps suffer from the drawback of not generating the same output after several cycles of switching on and off intermittently to evaluate the potential of microplasma uv lamps in this regard the effect of six on off cycles was investigated for all incident absolute and integrated irradiance values each cycle was comprised of 30 s irradiation and 10 s off times fig 7 demonstrates the measured irradiance values versus time revealing that the on off cycle did not shift the lamp performance in other words incident irradiation and intensity did not change when turning on the lamp with a 15 s stabilization time this characteristic of the microplasma uv lamp allows the treatment of intermittent flow because the lamp could only be in operation only when needed which would lead to power usage efficiency cost reduction and prolonged lamp lifespan 3 2 development of a protocol for calculating fluence rate 3 2 1 quantitative uniformity evaluation que the calculated cv and pf values at different distances from the microplasma uv lamp are presented in fig 8 the dashed horizontal lines compare the acceptable cv and pf values for uniformity assurance the determined pf values using the proposed method showed a pf equal or greater than 1 for some domains and distances from the microplasma uv lamp this could have been caused by a nonuniform radiation distribution at some circumstances since based on the pf definition pf 1 is due to the higher irradiance at locations other than the center pf is typically more applicable for the uv sources which deliver the maximum irradiance at the center of the irradiated surface thus evaluating the uniformity for the microplasma uv irradiation based on the pf values could be subject to errors and uncertainties the new cv is a general statistical variable known as the standard measure of any kind of distribution it is applicable unbiasedly for any cases including ones where there is no centric maximum irradiance therefore the cv can substitute the pf for microplasma uv lamps to evaluate the radiation uniformity on an irradiated surface final demonstrated results of the que test were extracted from the curves in fig 8 and listed in table 1 as the conditions in which the irradiance uniformity was obtained for the studied microplasma uv lamp on different circular surface sizes it is evident that at a distance of about 7 cm or greater the uniformity was met for all the domains since the domain determination method was based on the lamp s inherent structure which is consistent among microplasma uv lamps of any size these patterns can be scaled up or down for any lamp container size pairs by using a dimensionless parameter m d x in which d cm is the diameter of the solution container and x cm is the size of the lamp side by analyzing the required distance to obtain uniformity versus parameter m it was revealed that in the 0 m 0 4 range the uniformity was insured at a very short distance from the lamp 0 2 afterward the required distance for uniformity increased by a relatively linear function of m as demonstrated in fig s3 3 2 2 quantitative collimation evaluation qce to investigate the radiation collimation on containers of different sizes the evaluation test was conducted by calculating cf for two available solution containers with diameters of 1 8 cm and 5 5 cm as representative of containers smaller and larger than the lamp respectively these systems are designated hereafter as d1 8 and d5 5 respectively to calculate the cf the average irradiance and fluence rate on the solution surface should be determined thus the delivered average irradiance to the solution surface was calculated using the radiometry results on the relevant domains which were the circle 1 and circle 4 domains for the d1 8 and d5 5 systems respectively for instance for the d5 5 system the average irradiance was primarily calculated for the representative domain circle 4 by weighted averaging of the measured values on all its constituent sds 33 sds inside circle 4 in fig 2 after this the average irradiance on the solution container area was computed by multiplying the value for circle 4 into the sd5 5 scircle4 ratio which was near 1 to calculate the average fluence rate on the solution surface the actinometry experiments were performed for both systems the resultant cf values for the d5 5 system as presented in fig 9 showed a poor collimation at very close distances demonstrating that estimating the average fluence inside the solution by measuring the average irradiance on the solution surface can cause significant errors in these cases noncollimated beams on the solution surface create radiation gradients inside the solution resulting in a complex mixture of radiation photon pathlengths and reflections from the container wall the minimum distance to obtain a cf of more than 0 99 a generally acceptable value for the d5 5 system was determined to be 6 2 cm where on surface irradiance and fluence rate became identical and the fluence inside the solution could be estimated by measuring the irradiance for the d1 8 system the cf values demonstrated a different pattern over the distance at near field measurements a high cf was observed claiming identical irradiance and fluence values which may have been due to a point to point irradiation at this very short distance between each radiating microcavity and a point on the parallel solution surface this phenomenon took place for the d1 8 case as the size of the container was smaller than the lamp surface therefore the entire solution surface was covered by these parallel point to point short beams and the negative effect of lamp edges on collimation was avoided in this very short distance from the lamp the flatness of both surfaces facilitated the incident beams to be straight enough and parallel enough between surfaces when the distance was very short as seen in fig 9 the cf for d1 8 system started diminishing by increasing the distance and consequently creating nonparallel beams on the solution surface by the microcavities near the edges after a certain distance this decreasing trend stopped and changed to an increasing trend similar to the one for the d5 5 system eventually the standard collimation cf 0 99 was observed at 1 6 cm for the d1 8 system a general schematic of the collimation evaluation test for the solution containers that were smaller and larger than the lamp are described in fig s4 where the results can be extrapolated for any lamp container size pairs note that although the point to point irradiation may have caused parallel beams at very short distances for smaller size containers it would be highly recommended to design the experimental setups based on the second collimation distance this is due to the very sensitive irradiance values to the distances in such a close range which may cause serious errors in fluence measurements 3 2 3 quantitative divergence evaluation qde illustrated patterns in fig 10 a b compare the calculated df values from the definition eq 1 and point source assumption eq 2 for different circular domains the comparison demonstrates the minimum distance from the microplasma uv lamp after which the point source assumption becomes valid according to the resultant values after 1 cm the df pattern became independent of the domain size because the divergence was created in the depth of the container and was not a function of its surface size the pattern for both api and igi values were nearly identical indicating that the divergence was independent of the spd of the source to further study the point source assumption for lamps with possible smaller sizes the qde test was repeated for a reduced size version of the lamp by masking its surface as illustrated in fig 10 c the inset graphs of fig 10 a b show the df pattern for the smaller lamp on the circle 1 domain compared with the point source assumption it was revealed that the minimum distance to achieve a point source was much shorter for the smaller lamp 3 cm than the one for the original size lamp 6 5 cm a similar procedure can be applied to any lamp size to calculate the df pattern independent of the container size 3 2 4 fluence rate calculation after studying the irradiation uniformity and collimation over the solution surface two more correcting phenomena must be considered to precisely calculate the average fluence rate inside the solution 1 when a beam passes between two media due to the change in refractive indices a small part of the incident radiation is reflected back into the first medium obeying the fresnel law 2 since aqueous solutions absorb uv with any wavelength of interest a decrease in the irradiance arises as the beam passes through the solution according to the beer lambert law these two phenomena do not limit the setup designs however they must be considered to determine the average fluence inside the solution by correcting the irradiance on the solution surface by parameters termed as the reflection factor rf and the water factor wf respectively rf can be calculated at each wavelength by using the reflection coefficient r of the aqueous solution as rfλ 1 rλ r can be computed for a collimated incident radiation on the surface using eq 3 3 r λ n 1 λ n 2 λ n 1 λ n 2 λ 2 where n 1 λ and n 2 λ are the refractive indexes for mediums 1 and 2 at the wavelength λ respectively as the microplasma uv lamp is a well monochromatic source refractive indexes in the peak wavelength 221 nm in this case can be readily used to calculate rf without requiring any spd based weighting according to the literature huibers 1997 the refractive index of water at 221 nm is 0 973 since the rf is a function of the angle of incident beams eq 3 must be utilized after the collimation is ensured by the qce test moreover although the refractive index was reported to be a function of temperature this effect was found to be negligible in our case as the refractive index was not sensitive in the temperature change range for solutions under microplasma uv lamp irradiation wf is defined as the ratio of average fluence inside the solution to the average fluence at the surface and computed through eq 4 for each wavelength which is derived by integrating the beer lambert law over the depth of solution 4 w f λ 1 10 α λ l α λ l l n 10 where αλ cm 1 is the decadic absorption coefficient of the solution at each wavelength λ and l cm is the depth of the solution for polychromatic sources such as medium pressure uv lamps and some uv leds this correction must be spd weighted over the spectrum however as the microplasma uv lamp has been shown to be a monochromatic source the wf can be calculated at the peak wavelength i e 221 nm in this work as an assumption the fraction of photons that was reflected back into solution after passing through the solution depth was neglected in eq 4 this is a fair assumption as beams that reach the bottom of the container are totally absorbed by the uv opaque material of the container wf should be calculated for the system after the collimation is ensured by the qce test since its definition assumes that the incident radiation on the surface is collimated having a completely mixed solution is a crucial factor in attaining a uniform wf the decadic absorption coefficient in the wf formula is a function of concentration therefore as the solution becomes either diluted or denser of the uv absorbing species over time the decadic absorption coefficient and consequently wf varies this change in wf value during the uv based degradation experiment was not considered in previous protocols for calculating uv fluence inside the solution however these changes are not negligible when studying chemicals with considerable uv absorptions therefore assuming a constant wf over time could lead to error prone calculation of uv fluence affecting the reported photokinetic rate constants this error is more substantial in the degradation of organic contaminants and micropollutants through uv oxidants where the suspension of some chemicals could have considerable initial absorption furthermore the uv driven photolysis of the oxidant and secondary photo initiated reactions among the generated active species and the chemical contaminant involved a total of 100 elementary reactions thus the solution became a complex mixture of numerous species with various absorption coefficients toward peak wavelength which could make the trend of wf over time extremely complicated and difficult to predict to address the time dependency effect of media absorbance during the experiments in calculating correct fluence inside the reactor wf must be calculated in a time weighted manner prior to computing the average fluence until the variations in wf become negligible δwf 5 toward this goal the absorbance of the solution at peak wavelength was primarily measured at various time intervals with a spectrometer aλ t then the relative decadic absorption coefficient αλ t was calculated by using the definition of transmittance tλ t and used for calculating the time weighted wfλ t as described in eqs 5 7 5 t λ t 10 a λ t 6 α λ t log t λ t l 7 w f λ t 1 10 α λ t l α λ t l l n 10 the actual wf is calculated by averaging the wf t values over the time period τ 8 w f λ 1 τ t 0 τ w f λ t in collimated and uniform irradiance assured circumstances the overall average fluence inside the solution can be calculated using the following equation 9 f e d f r f c f w f τ where f mj cm 2 is the average fluence inside the solution e mw cm 2 is the average incident irradiance on the solution surface and τ s is the exposure time 3 3 case studies to check the reproducibility of the photokinetic data in the quasi collimated apparatus designed by the protocol the uv inactivation degradation experiments were conducted in two distinct systems the distance between the microplasma uv lamp and the solution was set to 2 cm and 6 5 cm for systems with d1 8 and d5 5 containers respectively to obtain all evaluation test factors that is cv cf and df in a satisfactory range these values were then used together with complimentary uv fluence correction factors rf and wf to determine the applied average fluence using eq 9 to calculate the wf of the solution in each case through eq 4 the absorbance data of that actual solution sample toward 221 nm uv exposure was used in addition it was assumed that the wf changes during the reaction time were not negligible and wf was calculated independently for each sample in time intervals 3 3 1 kinetic study for inactivating microbial cells the average log reduction of viable cells in the d1 8 system is presented in fig 11 a as a function of uv fluence the overall mechanism of e coli inactivation presented a lag phase for around 2 5 mj cm 2 fluence shoulder region followed by a linear loss of bacterial viability over uv exposure which was consistent with the literature clauß et al 2005 a tailing region was also observed at high log inactivations which was reported in the literature as being the result of a significant shielding effect in aqueous media of high cell density 106 cfu ml 1 matafonova et al 2008 another reason for this tailing region was the decrease in cell concentration below the detection limit 101 cfu ml 1 since the fluence response curve of e coli cells included a shoulder region eq 10 was employed as a multi parameter mathematical model to report the incremental log inactivation as a function of the delivered fluence 10 n n 0 1 1 10 k f n where n 0 is the initial e coli cell concentration cfu ml 1 before exposure n is the final cell concentration cfu ml 1 in the uv treated sample and f is the average fluence inside the suspension mj cm 2 also variables k and n of the model represent the first order inactivation rate constant in the linear region cm mj 1 and the number of critical targets respectively the k and n variables would be determined by nonlinear least square curve fitting of the model with the experimental data the best fitted model curve is depicted in fig 11 a the red line which resulted in k and n values of 0 494 cm2 mj 1 and 7 572 respectively with a high correlation coefficient of 0 995 in the combined shoulder and linear regions the shielding effect and below detection limit concentration prevented this model from predicting the tailing region however the standard for reporting uv dose requirements for any disinfection method is typically up to 4 log inactivation 99 99 removal which was successfully predicted by the model for the alternative d5 5 system the same pattern of the inactivation fluence curve was observed figure not shown because of overlapping with the one for the d1 8 system the required fluence and time for incremental log inactivations were calculated based on the predicting model for both systems and is tabulated in table 2 a less than 5 difference between fluence based values showed the reproducibility of the log inactivation data regardless of the container size when collimated apparatuses were used furthermore in a time based version it was clear that more uv exposure time would be required for the d5 5 system to achieve a certain log inactivation as the fluence rate was lower at that distance based on the results an average value of 9 9 mj cm 2 uv dose is required to achieve 4 log inactivation of e coli which is in close agreement with the one exhibited by 222 nm excilamps reported in the literature clauß et al 2005 3 3 2 kinetic study for eliminating chemical contaminants the degradation of 5 mg l 1 mb in a uv h2o2 solution with different oxidant doses was investigated in the same apparatuses described in the disinfection section the wf reached an almost constant value after 45 s of irradiation the time averaged wf at 45 s showed a 12 error compared with the wf at the initial condition which confirmed the potential error of previous constant wf assumption even in such a dilute sample of the organic contaminant when the mb solution was exposed to pure 222 nm only a slight degradation was observed however notably high removals were obtained in the presence of h2o2 oxidant since the organic contaminants were degraded much more effectively and extensively by uv initiated oxidation than by direct uv photolysis this was caused by the highly reactive radical and oxidizing species generated under uv h2o2 conditions the mb removal patterns in the d1 8 system by the uv h2o2 process with different initial h2o2 concentrations are shown in fig 11 b the mb degradation at 1 2 mm and 0 6 mm doses of h2o2 were comparable 97 6 and 96 1 at about 195 mj cm 2 uv fluence respectively but the removal rates at 0 3 mm and 0 1 mm were significantly lower at the same uv fluence 86 6 and 65 8 respectively this showed that among the different h2o2 concentrations tested 0 6 mm was the suitable one as it achieved a comparable mb degradation to that of 1 2 mm where lower h2o2 concentration was balanced by higher 221 nm uv transmittance of the 0 6 mm h2o2 solution to evaluate the kinetics of degradation the first order model was utilized for the analysis of experimental data the linear fittings with reasonable correlation coefficients r 2 0 98 dashed lines in fig 11 b indicate that all reactions followed first order kinetics the first order rate constant values of the mb removal were calculated in the fluence based manner to compare them between the two studied systems as is shown in table 2 identical fluence based rate constants with error 5 resulted for the d1 8 and d5 5 setups which confirmed that the proposed protocol was able to calculate the correct average fluence inside the solution the time based rate constants also demonstrated the lower energy delivered to the d5 5 container which was positioned farther from the lamp the fluence based k values can be reliably used as the general ones for mb degradation in any 221 nm microplasma uv reactor independent of its size as long as the que qcu and qde evaluation tests ensure the uniformity of radiation distribution inside the solution the same procedure can be utilized for any organic contaminant with any initial concentration and dose of oxidant the most crucial factor in using the protocol for other solutions is to precisely determine the time weighted wf based on the actual absorbance data of the solution 4 conclusion in this work a protocol was proposed for operating the recently emerged microplasma uv lamp for studying the rate of microbial inactivation and chemical contaminant degradation in water purification applications in the first stage a method for measuring and controlling lamp radiant wavelength and power output was suggested lamp temperature electrical current and intermittent on off cycles were investigated as potential output altering operational conditions results demonstrated that 1 the spd related specifications peak wavelength fwhm and gtir and radiation pattern of the lamp are independent of operating conditions 2 the irradiance values are affected only and linearly by the electrical current and 3 no warm up time and typically a 15 s stabilization time are required for the lamp to reach full and constant output in the second phase designing uniformly irradiated quasi collimated setups for the microplasma uv was analyzed to accurately study the kinetics and mechanisms of uv induced reactions a quasi collimated setup was obtained for the microplasma uv lamp even without a collimating column a protocol was proposed to determine the distance at which the collimation and uniformity would be insured for different lamp sizes and solution container scales to calculate the average fluence inside the solutions the wf concept was redefined for uv initiated oxidation processes as a function of time this study and the developed protocol are expected to play a major role in obtaining accurate kinetics data which is essential in the design and fabrication of the next generation of uv photoreactors and exhibits great potential for various applications in environmental engineering such as in water treatment this in turn is anticipated to generate a great deal of interest among researchers on the applications of a viable new uv source

18570,the newly emerged microplasma uv radiating technology can be a viable alternative to conventional radiation sources for uv water treatment the capability of the microplasma uv lamp to monochromatically irradiate various wavelengths with different pulsation frequencies in a flat form opens new pathways for the development of novel uv based water purifiers this study is the first to systematically examine the microplasma uv lamp and develop a robust experimental method and apparatus for its operation to study the kinetics of both microbial and chemical pollutant degradation the microplasma uv lamp was characterized in terms of its radiation profile and the impact of operating parameters on the lamp radiant power output it was shown to be an instant on and fast stabilized source the radiant power output was a linear function of the electrical current and was not influenced by the lamp operating temperature and intermittent on off cycles a protocol was developed for obtaining reliable kinetic data for uv induced elimination of microorganisms and micropollutants an experimental setup was proposed for the kinetic studies where the characteristics of the incident irradiance of the lamp including uniformity collimation and divergence were quantitatively evaluated in addition the water factor wf for calculating the average fluence rate was redefined for both the transient and steady state conditions this modification is essential to account for changes in the uv transmittance of the medium which could be an important factor for kinetic study of chemical contaminants two studied cases of microbial direct inactivation and the chemical photo initiated oxidation process in different setups based on the developed protocol confirmed the reproducibility of the fluence based kinetic data independent of the reactor size the proposed protocol can be applied to the kinetic study of the elimination of microbial and chemical contaminants using microplasma uv lamps of any size power and peak wavelength graphical abstract image 1 keywords ultraviolet uv microplasma characterization protocol water treatment 1 introduction ultraviolet uv water disinfection has been a fast growing technology over the past decades thanks to its chemical freeness low by product formation tendency and absence of overdosing risk song et al 2016 moreover uv can degrade organic compounds by uv based advanced oxidation processes assisted by the addition of oxidants nihemaiti et al 2018 or photosensitizing agents such as photocatalysts bararpour et al 2018 the main uv radiation sources employed in the municipal disinfection or advanced oxidation installations are mercury vapor uv lamps however these lamps contain a considerable quantity of mercury which leads to a significant amount of hazardous material after the lamp s lifespan pirnie et al 2006 other challenges associated with mercury lamps are long warm up time filament distortion and geometrical restrictions for the reactor design autin et al 2013 chevremont et al 2013 more recently uv light emitting diode uv led technology has emerged as an alternative for conventional sources and attracted attention because it has no mercury usage low energy consumption compactness and no warm up time matafonova and batoev 2018 song et al 2019 the unique features of uv leds make them a great candidate for point of use water purification systems to be implemented in remote areas taghipour 2013 however relatively low radiant power of the present uvc leds has impeded their progress for large scale applications microcavity plasma or microplasma uv is a new radiation technology that offers some advantages over current uv generating sources the flat thin microplasma uv lamps are driven by at least two interlaced arrays of tiny cavities microcavities with distinct dimensions fabricated into the interior surface of the lamp park et al 2017 in this mercury free technology a rare gas occupies the volume inside the lamp and is in contact with the microcavity array by turning on the lamp the voltage interacts with the gas such that a spatially uniform plasma is formed and confined within the microcavities this is the microplasma this microplasma produces uv generating rare gas excimer molecules which emit radiation in the deep uv spectral region becker et al 2006 to date available microplasma uv lamps use xe2 krcl and xecl excimers to monochromatically radiate at 172 222 and 308 nm peak wavelengths respectively and phosphor for a broad spectrum of 220 280 nm park et al 2016 the presence of the microcavities improves the power output and efficiency of the lamp by at least a factor of two compared with the previous sources for the mentioned peak wavelengths park et al 2017 additionally the planar geometry of these lamps helps them to emit collimated and spatially uniform beams these lamps possess a great potential to create new opportunities for the development of planar uv photoreactors for fluid treatment applications for any newly emerging radiation source a standardized technique is required for the operation characterization and controlling of the radiation performance for the mercury uv lamps several practical procedures for output characterizations have been previously suggested and adopted as the standard by the international ultraviolet association iuva lawal et al 2008 sasges and robinson 2005 as for uv leds a distinct characterization protocol has been recently proposed for investigating the effects of operational conditions and measurement techniques kheyrandish et al 2017 in addition to the characterization protocol a comprehensive protocol must be established for a uv radiation source to design appropriate apparatuses to facilitate obtaining accurate and consistent photo chemical kinetic data which could be applied for the reactor design for uv induced reactions the most accurate way to present the kinetic data is as a function of uv fluence received by the solution components bolton et al 2015b for precise determination of the average fluence rate inside a solution uniform radiation distribution should be obtained this is possible whenever a uniform irradiation field on the solution surface is provided by collimating a set of vertically projected beams in this regard for uv lamps the designing approach of standard setups referred to as collimated beams has been proposed and accepted by the iuva bolton et al 2015a bolton and linden 2003 similarly for uv leds a new method has been recently developed by systematically revising the uv lamp protocol considering the unique characteristics of uv leds kheyrandish et al 2018a however the proposed protocols for uv lamps and uv leds cannot be extended to microplasma uv lamps because the radiation source structure and the technology of uv emission are completely different the present study aimed to develop a protocol for designing appropriate apparatuses to accurately investigate the kinetics and mechanisms of uv induced reactions which will be applicable to microplasma uv lamps of any intensity size and peak wavelength as the primary stage a comprehensive characterization methodology was proposed for the microplasma uv lamp in a non uv absorbing medium this was achieved by introducing the lamp specifications and investigating the effect of operating parameters such as lamp temperature and electrical current on the lamp power output furthermore a special method was devised for studying the microplasma uv lamp incident irradiance pattern finally after conducting systematic quantitative uniformity evaluation que quantitative collimation evaluation qce and quantitative divergence evaluation qde tests on the incident irradiation a protocol was proposed for obtaining uniform radiation distribution inside solutions irradiated by the microplasma uv for use in kinetic studies two uv induced cases were also presented to evaluate the reproducibility of the kinetic data in two distinct protocol based setup configurations for uv inactivation of escherichia coli as a representative for microorganisms and uv h2o2 degradation of methylene blue mb as a model organic contaminant 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials potassium iodate kio3 potassium iodide ki sodium tetraborate decahydrate na2b4o7 10h2o and mb c16h18cln3s were all supplied by sigma aldrich with no further purifications hydrogen peroxide solution h2o2 30 w w was acquired from the fisher scientific co e coli atcc 11229 was obtained from american type culture collection atcc manassas va usa and cultivated following the supplier s product data sheet all agents used in this study were analytical grade and all solutions apart from microbial suspensions were prepared with deionized water 2 2 lamp characterization method a 2 2 in2 microplasma uv lamp with an active illuminating area of about 16 cm2 was acquired from eden park illumination inc the utilized microplasma uv lamp is shown in fig 1 along with the electrical circuit for supplying power to the lamp the lamp was connected to an analog dc power supply model aim tti ex355r so that the input voltage and current could be controlled lamp temperature and flowing electrical current were considered as operational conditions and were studied over irradiation time the effect of intermittent on off cycles was also investigated as another important characteristic of a radiation source the output of a radiation source is usually presented by two groups of specifications which are related to the irradiant power of the source and the spectral power distribution spd of the beams in the first group the incident irradiance from the lamp on a given surface was studied the important values included the following absolute irradiance at the peak wavelength absolute peak irradiance api the integrated irradiance over the radiation spectrum integrated total irradiance iti and irradiance over the germicidal spectrum of 200 300 nm integrated germicidal irradiance igi in the second group of lamp specifications peak wavelength full width at half maximum fwhm and germicidal to total irradiance ratio gtir of the emitted beams were evaluated 2 2 1 domain determination method typically to study the irradiance received by surfaces in front of a radiation source a method is required for dividing the total domain into certain constituent sub domains sds radiometry measurements can be operated on the determined sds to estimate the average irradiance on the domain assuming the radiating surface of the commercial flat microplasma uv lamp as a 2d square it consists of many circular arcs with two diameters of 2 11 mm and 0 71 mm these arcs are positioned side by side so a small arc is adjacent to four larger arcs in four cartesian directions and vice versa fig 2 b the main nonuniformity in the pattern of arcs is an arc empty corner and a spacer at the center of the lamp where a set of the mentioned arcs are absent although the lamp face is square shaped a circular domain for radiant characterization is preferred so that it can be applied to the standard solution containers used for photokinetic studies which usually have circular surfaces petri dishes beakers etc the recommended method is described in fig 2 in which each sd is in front of a circular area of the lamp face with a diameter of 5 26 mm and contains 4 small and 4 large 4 4 arcs 4 microcavity sds in most cases to evaluate the effects of the abovementioned nonuniformities on the irradiance there are some sds in front of circles which contain 3 3 arcs 3 microcavity sds 2 2 arcs 2 microcavity sds and 0 0 arcs 0 microcavity sds each domain circles 1 to 4 contain 8 n 1 sds where n is the circle number this domain determination method can be extended for lamps of any size radiation pattern and viewing angle because it is based on the lamp s inherent structure that is the square shape and the two sizes of tiny microcavities furthermore the method provides the capability of conducting the irradiance uniformity evaluation tests for different solution container sizes by using the domains larger than the lamp e g circle 4 in fig 2 a 2 2 2 radiometry a radiometry configuration was fabricated to measure the incident irradiance distribution on a plane using a detector spectral irradiance was measured with an ocean optics usb2000 spectrometer equipped with a sony ilx511b ccd detector the detecting instrument has a measurement range of 200 850 nm with a resolution of 0 38 nm to obtain more accurate radiometry data on the determined sds the area exposed to radiation was controlled using two methods partially masking the detector wide sensor and a using fiber optic probe in addition since the radiation profile of uv sources is directional the detector was equipped with a cosine corrector with spectralon diffusing material to ensure that the measured number was the normal vector of the incident photon to the surface according to the definition of irradiance for more details see text s1 2 2 3 actinometry chemical actinometry a photochemical method widely used to determine the photon flow entering a solution was applied to determine the fluence rate due to the high absorption coefficient of the actinometer in the uvc region the photons are fully absorbed in a very thin layer less than 1 mm on the top of the solution thus the measured fluence rate with the chemical actinometry is assumed as the fluence rate on the solution surface ki kio3 actinometry which is appropriate to be used for a monochromatic lamp in the deep uvc region was applied the actinometry measurement was performed with 0 1 m kio3 0 6 m ki and 0 01 m na2b4o7 10h2o solution following the standard procedure proposed in the literature by considering all the correction factors for fluence calculation on the solution surface bolton et al 2011 although the microplasma uv lamp is a well monochromatic source the quantum yield of the iodide iodate actinometry was corrected based on the spd as it is a very sensitive function of the wavelength goldstein and rabani 2008 to prevent any systematic errors the container was completely filled with actinometry solution to avoid wall reflectance and was stirred 30 s before each experiment to provide well mixing conditions 2 3 evaluation tests for the protocol development in this protocol three systematic evaluation tests were proposed to increase the accuracy of in solution fluence rate calculation by providing uniform radiation distribution inside the solutions in the que test the distribution of the incident irradiance across the circular surface was evaluated to find a distance where the irradiance was distributed uniformly enough petri factor pf and coefficient of variation cv are represented as statistical parameters in the literature for quantitatively analyzing irradiance uniformity bolton and linden 2003 kheyrandish et al 2018a the pf is described as the ratio of the average incident irradiance over the surface to the irradiance at the center the cv is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of the incident irradiance values to their mean value a minimum pf of 0 9 and a maximum cv of 6 7 are reported to be appropriate for uniformity assurance for the microplasma uv system the pf and cv variables were calculated using the measured irradiance data on various sds to evaluate irradiance uniformity see section 2 2 1 delivered beams to a planar surface may not all be parallel and perpendicularly incident this could cause radiation gradients and reflections to be created nonuniformly inside the solution leading to the setup incompetency for reliable kinetic study to quantitatively investigate the extent of collimation a collimation factor cf is applied which is equal to the ratio of the delivered irradiance to the fluence rate over the surface where a cf 1 means complete collimation in the qce test we calculated cf along the distance from the microplasma uv lamp 0 10 cm to achieve satisfactory collimation where cf 0 99 qde is conducted due to the divergence of the beam as it passes through the depth of the solution container leading to the existence of a radiation gradient in this regard divergence factor df was evaluated for solutions irradiated by the microplasma uv lamp which is defined as the ratio of the average radiation inside the empty container to its value on the surface df was calculated based on an equation describing its definition eq 1 by measuring the delivered radiation at different depths of the container with a 0 2 cm step size and integrating it throughout the total depth 1 cm 1 d f d d l e x d x l e d where d cm is the distance between the lamp and container surface and l cm is the container depth with dx as its step size when the point source assumption can be made for the radiation source the following simplified equation can be used 2 d f d d l hence the qdf test can be used to find the minimum distance from the microplasma uv lamp where the point source assumption becomes valid the abovementioned factors were measured for different solution containing vessel sizes to propose a general protocol for designing quasi collimated apparatuses 2 4 uv degradation experiments as an example of the uv disinfection process inactivation of the e coli bacterium was studied as one of the most commonly used surrogates for enteric pathogens details of stock preparation cell culturing and colony enumerating methods are described in text s2 the initial density of e coli for each disinfection experiment was set to 106 cfu ml 1 additionally a uv hydrogen peroxide system was selected as a common uv based photo initiated oxidation degradation of mb was measured as a well known model organic contaminant because its concentration can easily be calculated by measuring the absorbance of the solution at 664 nm with a uv vis ible spectrophotometer using the beer lambert law the actual inactivation and degradation experiments were conducted in bench scale collimated and uniformly irradiated which was ensured by the developed protocol and the uv apparatuses equipped with a 2 2 in2 microplasma uv lamp emitting radiation nominally at 222 nm the reaction solution was put into two quartz cylindrical containers with inner diameters of 5 5 cm and 1 8 cm respectively and depth of 1 cm and placed on a stir plate perpendicular to the incident radiation a black sheet with an aperture was put on top of the container so that the beams entered the solution only from the container surface rather than the walls this is particularly crucial when the container size is smaller than the lamp a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig s1 the entire apparatus was covered by a black box during the experiment to avoid any potential photodegradation or photoreactivation by the ambient light 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of microplasma uv the measured spd of the studied microplasma uv lamp is presented in fig s2 the fwhm of the 221 nm microplasma uv lamp emission spectrum was around 3 nm which confirmed the monochromatic source assumption for this source gtir of the spectrum was about 0 92 based on the relative irradiation values which was much higher than the one for the medium pressure mercury lamps commonly used in microbial inactivation applications this showed that the source emitted much less photoreactivation initiating radiation photoreactivation phenomenon is a molecular mechanism in which bacterial enzymes compensate for dna damages induced by germicidal uvc by absorbing uva 315 380 nm and visible light song et al 2019 3 1 1 radiation pattern a clear qualitative observation of the radiation distribution on planes in various distances from the microplasma uv lamp is illustrated in optical images in fig 3 it can be understood that although the microplasma uv lamp had a square face the radiation mostly had a circular radiation profile with higher intensities at the center and lower ones at the edges fig 4 a shows the pattern of the igi values over the distance from the microplasma uv lamp on nine sds inside the circle 1 domain equal values were observed for the measured irradiances on eight sds with same decreasing pattern along the distance there were only tiny divergences at very close distances from the lamp which would be due to the existent noises and errors for detector measurements at the near field readings kheyrandish et al 2018b however on the centric sd the irradiance values significantly increased 135 from 0 to 0 4 cm and then decreased similar to those of the other sds this is because of the absence of microcavities at the center of the lamp the pattern of delivered radiation to adjacent sds in a row is analyzed in fig 4 b for a set of four sds see fig 4 d for sd locations the resultant patterns demonstrated lower incident irradiance on near edge locations in addition sd4 which was outside of the lamp size surface showed a different pattern maximum value at a distance other than 0 in comparison with sd1 to sd3 similar to the centric sd but with considerably lower values this showed that although the areas outside the lamp surface still received irradiance the nonuniformities would be significant on a container with a larger surface area than the lamp up to a distance of about 6 cm from the lamp four types of sds were based on the number of constituent microcavities 0 2 3 and 4 interestingly the radiometry results on the lamp surface showed that irradiance on 3 microcavity and 2 microcavity sds were nearly 3 4 and 1 2 of that on a 4 microcavity sd respectively see fig 4 c distance 0 by increasing the distance from the lamp however the abovementioned ratios were not observed among the delivered radiations on four types of sds due to the cumulative effect of adjacent irradiating microcavities on each other from a distance of about 6 cm all sds were almost equally irradiated which could lead to a uniform radiation distribution on larger sized containers in front of the microplasma uv lamps similar observations can be seen on the cross sectional optical images in fig 3 3 1 2 effect of lamp temperature the irradiance received on a random 4 microcavity sd was studied in 1 s intervals over 8 min of illumination to evaluate the effect of lamp running time and temperature on its output specifications fig 5 shows a sample of resultant data at a 1 cm distance from the lamp the same patterns were observed at other distances the lamp started illuminating instantly when it was plugged into an electrical source that is no warm up time was required due to the lamp s mercury free design the irradiance dramatically increased in the first 15 s of irradiating with no significant change in the lamp temperature afterward although the temperature increased from the ambient temperature to 40 c the received irradiance increased relatively negligibly 3 after 15 s and below 1 after 60 s with regard to all absolute and integrated irradiances this phenomenon revealed that providing a short 15 s stabilization time was enough to reach to a fairly constant maximum output it was significantly shorter than the reported physical warm up time for uv lamps and stabilization time for uv led kheyrandish et al 2017 mcdermott et al 2008 while pursuing the reason for this stabilization time it was observed that the flowing electrical current through the lamp circuit increased in the first 15 s and remained almost constant after that according to ohm s law in a constant input voltage this change in current showed that the system resistance decreased in the first 15 s thus providing a cooling system for the lamp powering circuit would be helpful for increasing power delivering efficiencies and decreasing the required stabilization time the intrinsic instant on and fast stabilized full output characteristics of the microplasma uv lamp are crucial factors in using this uv radiation source for designing industrial scale photoreactors with intermittence flow fig 5 b demonstrates the effect of lamp temperature on the lamp spd specifications as there was almost no change in their values during the studied 8 min of irradiation in spite of the significant temperature increase although it was found that lamp temperature did not affect its output specifications in the studied range raising of the temperature to very high values may be detrimental to the lamp either suddenly burning microcavities or gradually reducing the lamp s effective lifetime hence using a fan or any simple thermal management device is recommended to dissipate the generated heat and control the lamp temperature 3 1 3 effect of electrical current a range of operating current from 0 1 a to the maximum allowable value was tested using a digital dc power supply as with any other electrical device there is a maximum allowable operating voltage for the microplasma uv lamp which was set by the manufacturer 12v for the lamp studied here proportional to 0 65 a current a higher electrical current may alter the temperature increasing rate of the microplasma uv lamp therefore in order to independently investigate the effect of current a constant temperature rising rate was maintained using a cooling fan the irradiance was measured after it attained a stabilized value based on what was described in section 3 1 2 as depicted in fig 6 b spd related specifications of the emitted radiation showed no significant variation from increasing the electrical current in the safe allowable range furthermore in the studied current range the over distance incident irradiance pattern on different locations sds was not affected and similar patterns as illustrated in fig 4 were observed however all absolute and integrated irradiance values on an sd were considerably affected by changing the electrical current fig 6 a this functionality can be extended to all sds since the relative radiation pattern was not altered by modifying the electrical current linear relations were observed between the electrical current and all the studied peak absolute and integrated irradiances ultimately these linear trendlines could be utilized as a calibration curve to provide appropriate irradiances in a microplasma uv apparatus by adjusting the input current or conversely measuring the unknown irradiance inside a photoreactor by simply controlling the flowing current note that delivering overvoltage values would have destructive effects on the lamp by either causing significant damage to the lamp possibly burning it out or decreasing lamp lifespan by degrading the window material hence lower currents are recommended to extend the efficient lifespan to 10 000 h on the other hand running a lamp on a very low voltage therefore with less light output may extend its operating life but is not an enhancement to efficiency 3 1 4 effect of intermittent on off cycles conventional uv lamps suffer from the drawback of not generating the same output after several cycles of switching on and off intermittently to evaluate the potential of microplasma uv lamps in this regard the effect of six on off cycles was investigated for all incident absolute and integrated irradiance values each cycle was comprised of 30 s irradiation and 10 s off times fig 7 demonstrates the measured irradiance values versus time revealing that the on off cycle did not shift the lamp performance in other words incident irradiation and intensity did not change when turning on the lamp with a 15 s stabilization time this characteristic of the microplasma uv lamp allows the treatment of intermittent flow because the lamp could only be in operation only when needed which would lead to power usage efficiency cost reduction and prolonged lamp lifespan 3 2 development of a protocol for calculating fluence rate 3 2 1 quantitative uniformity evaluation que the calculated cv and pf values at different distances from the microplasma uv lamp are presented in fig 8 the dashed horizontal lines compare the acceptable cv and pf values for uniformity assurance the determined pf values using the proposed method showed a pf equal or greater than 1 for some domains and distances from the microplasma uv lamp this could have been caused by a nonuniform radiation distribution at some circumstances since based on the pf definition pf 1 is due to the higher irradiance at locations other than the center pf is typically more applicable for the uv sources which deliver the maximum irradiance at the center of the irradiated surface thus evaluating the uniformity for the microplasma uv irradiation based on the pf values could be subject to errors and uncertainties the new cv is a general statistical variable known as the standard measure of any kind of distribution it is applicable unbiasedly for any cases including ones where there is no centric maximum irradiance therefore the cv can substitute the pf for microplasma uv lamps to evaluate the radiation uniformity on an irradiated surface final demonstrated results of the que test were extracted from the curves in fig 8 and listed in table 1 as the conditions in which the irradiance uniformity was obtained for the studied microplasma uv lamp on different circular surface sizes it is evident that at a distance of about 7 cm or greater the uniformity was met for all the domains since the domain determination method was based on the lamp s inherent structure which is consistent among microplasma uv lamps of any size these patterns can be scaled up or down for any lamp container size pairs by using a dimensionless parameter m d x in which d cm is the diameter of the solution container and x cm is the size of the lamp side by analyzing the required distance to obtain uniformity versus parameter m it was revealed that in the 0 m 0 4 range the uniformity was insured at a very short distance from the lamp 0 2 afterward the required distance for uniformity increased by a relatively linear function of m as demonstrated in fig s3 3 2 2 quantitative collimation evaluation qce to investigate the radiation collimation on containers of different sizes the evaluation test was conducted by calculating cf for two available solution containers with diameters of 1 8 cm and 5 5 cm as representative of containers smaller and larger than the lamp respectively these systems are designated hereafter as d1 8 and d5 5 respectively to calculate the cf the average irradiance and fluence rate on the solution surface should be determined thus the delivered average irradiance to the solution surface was calculated using the radiometry results on the relevant domains which were the circle 1 and circle 4 domains for the d1 8 and d5 5 systems respectively for instance for the d5 5 system the average irradiance was primarily calculated for the representative domain circle 4 by weighted averaging of the measured values on all its constituent sds 33 sds inside circle 4 in fig 2 after this the average irradiance on the solution container area was computed by multiplying the value for circle 4 into the sd5 5 scircle4 ratio which was near 1 to calculate the average fluence rate on the solution surface the actinometry experiments were performed for both systems the resultant cf values for the d5 5 system as presented in fig 9 showed a poor collimation at very close distances demonstrating that estimating the average fluence inside the solution by measuring the average irradiance on the solution surface can cause significant errors in these cases noncollimated beams on the solution surface create radiation gradients inside the solution resulting in a complex mixture of radiation photon pathlengths and reflections from the container wall the minimum distance to obtain a cf of more than 0 99 a generally acceptable value for the d5 5 system was determined to be 6 2 cm where on surface irradiance and fluence rate became identical and the fluence inside the solution could be estimated by measuring the irradiance for the d1 8 system the cf values demonstrated a different pattern over the distance at near field measurements a high cf was observed claiming identical irradiance and fluence values which may have been due to a point to point irradiation at this very short distance between each radiating microcavity and a point on the parallel solution surface this phenomenon took place for the d1 8 case as the size of the container was smaller than the lamp surface therefore the entire solution surface was covered by these parallel point to point short beams and the negative effect of lamp edges on collimation was avoided in this very short distance from the lamp the flatness of both surfaces facilitated the incident beams to be straight enough and parallel enough between surfaces when the distance was very short as seen in fig 9 the cf for d1 8 system started diminishing by increasing the distance and consequently creating nonparallel beams on the solution surface by the microcavities near the edges after a certain distance this decreasing trend stopped and changed to an increasing trend similar to the one for the d5 5 system eventually the standard collimation cf 0 99 was observed at 1 6 cm for the d1 8 system a general schematic of the collimation evaluation test for the solution containers that were smaller and larger than the lamp are described in fig s4 where the results can be extrapolated for any lamp container size pairs note that although the point to point irradiation may have caused parallel beams at very short distances for smaller size containers it would be highly recommended to design the experimental setups based on the second collimation distance this is due to the very sensitive irradiance values to the distances in such a close range which may cause serious errors in fluence measurements 3 2 3 quantitative divergence evaluation qde illustrated patterns in fig 10 a b compare the calculated df values from the definition eq 1 and point source assumption eq 2 for different circular domains the comparison demonstrates the minimum distance from the microplasma uv lamp after which the point source assumption becomes valid according to the resultant values after 1 cm the df pattern became independent of the domain size because the divergence was created in the depth of the container and was not a function of its surface size the pattern for both api and igi values were nearly identical indicating that the divergence was independent of the spd of the source to further study the point source assumption for lamps with possible smaller sizes the qde test was repeated for a reduced size version of the lamp by masking its surface as illustrated in fig 10 c the inset graphs of fig 10 a b show the df pattern for the smaller lamp on the circle 1 domain compared with the point source assumption it was revealed that the minimum distance to achieve a point source was much shorter for the smaller lamp 3 cm than the one for the original size lamp 6 5 cm a similar procedure can be applied to any lamp size to calculate the df pattern independent of the container size 3 2 4 fluence rate calculation after studying the irradiation uniformity and collimation over the solution surface two more correcting phenomena must be considered to precisely calculate the average fluence rate inside the solution 1 when a beam passes between two media due to the change in refractive indices a small part of the incident radiation is reflected back into the first medium obeying the fresnel law 2 since aqueous solutions absorb uv with any wavelength of interest a decrease in the irradiance arises as the beam passes through the solution according to the beer lambert law these two phenomena do not limit the setup designs however they must be considered to determine the average fluence inside the solution by correcting the irradiance on the solution surface by parameters termed as the reflection factor rf and the water factor wf respectively rf can be calculated at each wavelength by using the reflection coefficient r of the aqueous solution as rfλ 1 rλ r can be computed for a collimated incident radiation on the surface using eq 3 3 r λ n 1 λ n 2 λ n 1 λ n 2 λ 2 where n 1 λ and n 2 λ are the refractive indexes for mediums 1 and 2 at the wavelength λ respectively as the microplasma uv lamp is a well monochromatic source refractive indexes in the peak wavelength 221 nm in this case can be readily used to calculate rf without requiring any spd based weighting according to the literature huibers 1997 the refractive index of water at 221 nm is 0 973 since the rf is a function of the angle of incident beams eq 3 must be utilized after the collimation is ensured by the qce test moreover although the refractive index was reported to be a function of temperature this effect was found to be negligible in our case as the refractive index was not sensitive in the temperature change range for solutions under microplasma uv lamp irradiation wf is defined as the ratio of average fluence inside the solution to the average fluence at the surface and computed through eq 4 for each wavelength which is derived by integrating the beer lambert law over the depth of solution 4 w f λ 1 10 α λ l α λ l l n 10 where αλ cm 1 is the decadic absorption coefficient of the solution at each wavelength λ and l cm is the depth of the solution for polychromatic sources such as medium pressure uv lamps and some uv leds this correction must be spd weighted over the spectrum however as the microplasma uv lamp has been shown to be a monochromatic source the wf can be calculated at the peak wavelength i e 221 nm in this work as an assumption the fraction of photons that was reflected back into solution after passing through the solution depth was neglected in eq 4 this is a fair assumption as beams that reach the bottom of the container are totally absorbed by the uv opaque material of the container wf should be calculated for the system after the collimation is ensured by the qce test since its definition assumes that the incident radiation on the surface is collimated having a completely mixed solution is a crucial factor in attaining a uniform wf the decadic absorption coefficient in the wf formula is a function of concentration therefore as the solution becomes either diluted or denser of the uv absorbing species over time the decadic absorption coefficient and consequently wf varies this change in wf value during the uv based degradation experiment was not considered in previous protocols for calculating uv fluence inside the solution however these changes are not negligible when studying chemicals with considerable uv absorptions therefore assuming a constant wf over time could lead to error prone calculation of uv fluence affecting the reported photokinetic rate constants this error is more substantial in the degradation of organic contaminants and micropollutants through uv oxidants where the suspension of some chemicals could have considerable initial absorption furthermore the uv driven photolysis of the oxidant and secondary photo initiated reactions among the generated active species and the chemical contaminant involved a total of 100 elementary reactions thus the solution became a complex mixture of numerous species with various absorption coefficients toward peak wavelength which could make the trend of wf over time extremely complicated and difficult to predict to address the time dependency effect of media absorbance during the experiments in calculating correct fluence inside the reactor wf must be calculated in a time weighted manner prior to computing the average fluence until the variations in wf become negligible δwf 5 toward this goal the absorbance of the solution at peak wavelength was primarily measured at various time intervals with a spectrometer aλ t then the relative decadic absorption coefficient αλ t was calculated by using the definition of transmittance tλ t and used for calculating the time weighted wfλ t as described in eqs 5 7 5 t λ t 10 a λ t 6 α λ t log t λ t l 7 w f λ t 1 10 α λ t l α λ t l l n 10 the actual wf is calculated by averaging the wf t values over the time period τ 8 w f λ 1 τ t 0 τ w f λ t in collimated and uniform irradiance assured circumstances the overall average fluence inside the solution can be calculated using the following equation 9 f e d f r f c f w f τ where f mj cm 2 is the average fluence inside the solution e mw cm 2 is the average incident irradiance on the solution surface and τ s is the exposure time 3 3 case studies to check the reproducibility of the photokinetic data in the quasi collimated apparatus designed by the protocol the uv inactivation degradation experiments were conducted in two distinct systems the distance between the microplasma uv lamp and the solution was set to 2 cm and 6 5 cm for systems with d1 8 and d5 5 containers respectively to obtain all evaluation test factors that is cv cf and df in a satisfactory range these values were then used together with complimentary uv fluence correction factors rf and wf to determine the applied average fluence using eq 9 to calculate the wf of the solution in each case through eq 4 the absorbance data of that actual solution sample toward 221 nm uv exposure was used in addition it was assumed that the wf changes during the reaction time were not negligible and wf was calculated independently for each sample in time intervals 3 3 1 kinetic study for inactivating microbial cells the average log reduction of viable cells in the d1 8 system is presented in fig 11 a as a function of uv fluence the overall mechanism of e coli inactivation presented a lag phase for around 2 5 mj cm 2 fluence shoulder region followed by a linear loss of bacterial viability over uv exposure which was consistent with the literature clauß et al 2005 a tailing region was also observed at high log inactivations which was reported in the literature as being the result of a significant shielding effect in aqueous media of high cell density 106 cfu ml 1 matafonova et al 2008 another reason for this tailing region was the decrease in cell concentration below the detection limit 101 cfu ml 1 since the fluence response curve of e coli cells included a shoulder region eq 10 was employed as a multi parameter mathematical model to report the incremental log inactivation as a function of the delivered fluence 10 n n 0 1 1 10 k f n where n 0 is the initial e coli cell concentration cfu ml 1 before exposure n is the final cell concentration cfu ml 1 in the uv treated sample and f is the average fluence inside the suspension mj cm 2 also variables k and n of the model represent the first order inactivation rate constant in the linear region cm mj 1 and the number of critical targets respectively the k and n variables would be determined by nonlinear least square curve fitting of the model with the experimental data the best fitted model curve is depicted in fig 11 a the red line which resulted in k and n values of 0 494 cm2 mj 1 and 7 572 respectively with a high correlation coefficient of 0 995 in the combined shoulder and linear regions the shielding effect and below detection limit concentration prevented this model from predicting the tailing region however the standard for reporting uv dose requirements for any disinfection method is typically up to 4 log inactivation 99 99 removal which was successfully predicted by the model for the alternative d5 5 system the same pattern of the inactivation fluence curve was observed figure not shown because of overlapping with the one for the d1 8 system the required fluence and time for incremental log inactivations were calculated based on the predicting model for both systems and is tabulated in table 2 a less than 5 difference between fluence based values showed the reproducibility of the log inactivation data regardless of the container size when collimated apparatuses were used furthermore in a time based version it was clear that more uv exposure time would be required for the d5 5 system to achieve a certain log inactivation as the fluence rate was lower at that distance based on the results an average value of 9 9 mj cm 2 uv dose is required to achieve 4 log inactivation of e coli which is in close agreement with the one exhibited by 222 nm excilamps reported in the literature clauß et al 2005 3 3 2 kinetic study for eliminating chemical contaminants the degradation of 5 mg l 1 mb in a uv h2o2 solution with different oxidant doses was investigated in the same apparatuses described in the disinfection section the wf reached an almost constant value after 45 s of irradiation the time averaged wf at 45 s showed a 12 error compared with the wf at the initial condition which confirmed the potential error of previous constant wf assumption even in such a dilute sample of the organic contaminant when the mb solution was exposed to pure 222 nm only a slight degradation was observed however notably high removals were obtained in the presence of h2o2 oxidant since the organic contaminants were degraded much more effectively and extensively by uv initiated oxidation than by direct uv photolysis this was caused by the highly reactive radical and oxidizing species generated under uv h2o2 conditions the mb removal patterns in the d1 8 system by the uv h2o2 process with different initial h2o2 concentrations are shown in fig 11 b the mb degradation at 1 2 mm and 0 6 mm doses of h2o2 were comparable 97 6 and 96 1 at about 195 mj cm 2 uv fluence respectively but the removal rates at 0 3 mm and 0 1 mm were significantly lower at the same uv fluence 86 6 and 65 8 respectively this showed that among the different h2o2 concentrations tested 0 6 mm was the suitable one as it achieved a comparable mb degradation to that of 1 2 mm where lower h2o2 concentration was balanced by higher 221 nm uv transmittance of the 0 6 mm h2o2 solution to evaluate the kinetics of degradation the first order model was utilized for the analysis of experimental data the linear fittings with reasonable correlation coefficients r 2 0 98 dashed lines in fig 11 b indicate that all reactions followed first order kinetics the first order rate constant values of the mb removal were calculated in the fluence based manner to compare them between the two studied systems as is shown in table 2 identical fluence based rate constants with error 5 resulted for the d1 8 and d5 5 setups which confirmed that the proposed protocol was able to calculate the correct average fluence inside the solution the time based rate constants also demonstrated the lower energy delivered to the d5 5 container which was positioned farther from the lamp the fluence based k values can be reliably used as the general ones for mb degradation in any 221 nm microplasma uv reactor independent of its size as long as the que qcu and qde evaluation tests ensure the uniformity of radiation distribution inside the solution the same procedure can be utilized for any organic contaminant with any initial concentration and dose of oxidant the most crucial factor in using the protocol for other solutions is to precisely determine the time weighted wf based on the actual absorbance data of the solution 4 conclusion in this work a protocol was proposed for operating the recently emerged microplasma uv lamp for studying the rate of microbial inactivation and chemical contaminant degradation in water purification applications in the first stage a method for measuring and controlling lamp radiant wavelength and power output was suggested lamp temperature electrical current and intermittent on off cycles were investigated as potential output altering operational conditions results demonstrated that 1 the spd related specifications peak wavelength fwhm and gtir and radiation pattern of the lamp are independent of operating conditions 2 the irradiance values are affected only and linearly by the electrical current and 3 no warm up time and typically a 15 s stabilization time are required for the lamp to reach full and constant output in the second phase designing uniformly irradiated quasi collimated setups for the microplasma uv was analyzed to accurately study the kinetics and mechanisms of uv induced reactions a quasi collimated setup was obtained for the microplasma uv lamp even without a collimating column a protocol was proposed to determine the distance at which the collimation and uniformity would be insured for different lamp sizes and solution container scales to calculate the average fluence inside the solutions the wf concept was redefined for uv initiated oxidation processes as a function of time this study and the developed protocol are expected to play a major role in obtaining accurate kinetics data which is essential in the design and fabrication of the next generation of uv photoreactors and exhibits great potential for various applications in environmental engineering such as in water treatment this in turn is anticipated to generate a great deal of interest among researchers on the applications of a viable new uv source

introduction ciprofloxacin cip is one of the broad spectrum fluoroquinolones fqs with antibacterial properties against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria kuemmerer 2009 porras et al 2016 it is widely used in the treatment of tuberculosis gastrointestinal urinary tract and respiratory tract infections of humans and as veterinary medicine to prevent or treat infectious diseases werner et al 2010 liu et al 2012 mackiw et al 2012 however cip ingested into the body can be partially metabolized and largely up to 72 excreted in its pharmacologically active form zhang et al 2015 cip has been widely detected in surface water 1 8 2150 ng l zhang et al 2015 groundwater 5 3 443 ng l jurado et al 2019 and effluent 7 15 670 ng l of wastewater treatment plants michael et al 2013 the occurrence and persistence of cip in the environmental media may pose a high ecotoxicity to various aquatic organisms including vibrio fischeri microcystis aeruginosa and synechococcus leopoliensis zhang et al 2012 cip toxicity towards other organisms including microcystis aeruginosa and lemna minor with the half maximal effective concentration of 17 μg l and 203 μg l respectively has also been reported robinson et al 2005 in addition the cip may also cause the physiological teratogenesis of plants algae and be genotoxic carcinogenic for organisms toolaram et al 2016 xiong et al 2017 even low concentration of cip can lead to the emergence and propagation of antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes posing threats to the environment and human health huijbers et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 although the activated sludge as process has been applied in wastewater treatment for more than one hundred years it is still the main process in municipal wastewater treatment plants of china ben et al 2018 liu and wong 2013 however recently several novel sulfur mediated biological processes were developed and applied for saline sewage treatment lu et al 2011 nitrate contaminated groundwater

treating antibiotics laden wastewaters chelliapan and sallis 2015 jia et al 2017 2019 zhang et al 2018 studies have reported that antibiotics can inhibit the activity of microorganisms and affect the biological cod and nitrogen removal in as process due to their toxicity to microorganisms amorim et al 2014 yi et al 2017 gonzalez martinez et al 2014 in addition antibiotics can shape the microbial

2010 however there are very limited studies on the stress responses of as and srb sludge exposed to the cip laden wastewater therefore the overarching goal of this study is to compare the stress responses of as and srb sludge while treating cip laden wastewater and elucidate the underlying mechanism of self protection against toxicity of cip the cip removal was investigated in as and srb sludge systems through continuously operated bioreactors and batch experiments the chronic effects of cip on as and srb sludge systems were evaluated based on the overall performances of these two sludge systems under cip exposure influent cip from 100 to 5000 μg l the stress responses of as and srb sludge exposed to cip were indicated by the microbial community variations and the eps changes in these two sludge systems respectively the findings of this study provide insights into the stress responses of as and srb sludge to cip for the first time and highlight the potential of sulfur mediated biological processes for antibiotics laden wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactors setup and operation two bioreactors namely sequencing batch reactor sbr working volume of 4 0 l and sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb working volume of 1 08 l see fig s1 in supplementary information si were seeded with activated sludge as and sulfate reducing bacteria srb sludge respectively the same synthetic wastewater except sulfate was fed into as and srb sludge bioreactors respectively more details for influent characterization in tables s1 and s2 and pages s5 s6 in si the two bioreactors were operated side by side continuously for 200 days with cip dosage in influent 0 5000 μg l to examine cip removal and chronic effects of cip dosage on as and srb sludge systems in the first 40 days phase i the as and srb sludge were acclimated by feeding the synthetic wastewater no cip addition into sbr and srusb reactors respectively cip 99 purity saint louis mo usa was

it covers the cip concentrations reported in municipal pharmaceutical and hospital wastewaters lindberg et al 2004 guo et al 2017 the influent cip contributed very little cod in this study because even 5000 μg l of cip the highest influent cip concentration merely accounted for 2 of influent cod the solids retention time srt of sbr and srusb bioreactors were 10 and 20 days respectively and each operational phase 40 days enclosed 2 srts at least see pages s4 s6 in si for operational details of two bioreactors the steady state of bioreactors can be indicated by reactor performance i e concentrations of cod cip nitrogen and sulfate in effluent the influent and effluent of each reactor were collected daily for analyses of cod cip nitrogen in sbr sulfate and sulfide in srusb concentrations in aqueous phase to evaluate the performances of these two bioreactors under cip exposure in addition the cip content in suspended sludge samples were analyzed every four days to examine the fate of cip in as and srb sludge systems respectively the cip removal efficiency and specific removal rate at different operational phases of sbr and srusb reactors were determined respectively see pages s6 s7 in si for details the srusb reactor was tightly sealed with gas collection and little biogas was collected and detected in this study 2 2 batch experiments for cip adsorption and biodegradation by as and srb sludge a series of batch experiments were designed to investigate the adsorption and biodegradation of cip by as and srb sludge the sludge used in batch experiments were taken from the above mentioned sbr and srusb reactors after 200 days operation respectively before the batch experiments the as and srb sludge were firstly washed three times with 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 2 until the cip content in the sludge samples was undetectable the prepared sludge was transferred into a series of identical 300 ml serum bottles working volume of 250 ml with average suspended solids ss concentration of 1 0 0 1 g l in each serum bottle the control tests were also conducted with no as or srb sludge addition but only synthetic wastewater to examine the possible volatilization and hydrolysis of cip initial cip concentration of 5000 μg l in each serum bottle each serum bottle was wrapped with aluminum foil to avoid photodegradation the serum bottles

extraction method used for the cip extraction from sludge samples and analysis method for cip concentration in aqueous phase were verified with the recovery rates of 88 3 0 2 and 97 2 0 5 and the good reproducibility within the relative standard deviations of 6 n 3 and 2 n 3 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption and biodegradation of cip in as and srb sludge systems the experimental results in abiotic control tests indicated that cip cannot be removed via volatilization or hydrolysis see fig s2 in si therefore cip removal in as and srb sludge systems is primarily via adsorption and biodegradation in this study see fig 1 cip was mainly adsorbed by eps and sludge after eps extraction in as system in an sbr continuously operated for 200 days five phases i v totally and almost no cip biodegradation was observed as shown in fig 1 a similarly liu et al 2013a reported that cip was mainly removed by adsorption and a low extent of cip biotransformation in aerobic cultures due to the inhibitory effect of cip furthermore the cip biodegradation observed by li and zhang 2010 was mainly attributed to fqs degrading bacteria which only existed in saline activated sludge while increasing the influent cip concentration from 0 phase i to 5000 μg l phase v the specific removal rate of cip by as system increased significantly p 0 05 from 32 9 5 4 to 734 2 19 6 μg g ss d fig 1 c nevertheless the removal efficiency of cip in as system decreased from 66 2 8 6 to 29 7 2 0 fig 1 a since the adsorption capacity of as cannot be re generated through cip biodegradation and releasing more adsorption sites on as zhang et al 2018 which can be verified by the cip accumulation in eps and sludge after eps extraction of as see fig s3 in si compared to as system cip removal by srb sludge system was more effective with the removal efficiency of 64 1 1 2 and the specific removal rate of 1154 7 32 6 μg g ss d at phase v 5000 μg l which can be attributed to a significant p 0 05 increase of biodegradation capacity of cip by srb sludge after long term acclimation fig 1 b and c it is important to point out that the specific adsorption rates of cip by eps of as and srb sludge increased significantly from 6 3 1 3 and 3 0 0 4 μg g ss d in phase ii influent cip 100 μg l to 299 2 8 5 and 323 9 11 4 μg g ss d in phase v influent cip 5000 μg l respectively as shown in fig 1 c these results indicated that eps play an important role in adsorbing cip and protecting the microbial cells in as and srb sludge against the toxicity of antibiotics as a natural barrier kong et al 2017a b xu et al 2013 gu et al 2017 as the stress response of biological sludge the eps content excreted by as and srb microbes was also analyzed in this study the cip transport and biodegradation in as and srb sludge were further investigated through a series of batch tests see fig 1 d e and f and fig s4 in si about 83 5 1 3 and 92 1 1 6 of cip in aqueous phase initial cip concentration of 5000 μg l was quickly adsorbed in the first 15 min with the specific adsorption of 4 1 0 2 and 4 6 0 3 μg mg ss by as and srb sludge respectively the cip was significantly p 0 05 transported into eps of as from aqueous phase and sludge after eps extraction in the first 12 h of batch tests as shown in fig 1 d however the cip was significantly desorbed from as into aqueous phase after 12 h of batch tests since little cip can be biodegraded by as and the unstable adsorption equilibrium of cip onto as zhang et al 2018 see fig 1 d and f the srb sludge exhibited a good removal of cip from the aqueous phase with biodegradation as the main pathway see fig 1 e and f however liu et al 2013b reported that no significant cip degradation was found in a sulfate reducing culture this difference may be due to the enrichment of functional microbes involved in cip degradation in srb sludge system after a long term cip acclimation compared with sulfate reducing culture without cip acclimation the transformation products tps of cip by srb sludge were examined in the batch tests and four possible biodegradation pathways of cip by srb sludge were proposed fig s4 in si in pathway a the cip was transformed into tp1 via removing c2h2 at the piperazinyl substituent via desethylation reaction and subsequently the tp2 was generated via loss of a c2h5n fragment of tp1 cvancarova et al 2015 prieto et al 2011 in pathway b the hydroxylation in position c 5 of cip resulted in the generation of tp3 and then the hydroxylation in position c 7 of cip replaced the piperazinyl group of tp3 and transformed tp3 into tp4 fig s4 in si in pathways c and d the hydroxylation in position c 6 and c 3 replaced fluorine and carboxyl group respectively to transform cip into tp5 and tp6 respectively fig s4 in si the results indicated that cip was biodegraded intracellularly via desethylation reaction in piperazinyl ring and hydroxylation reaction and six tps were detected fig s4 in si 3 2 cip impacts on pollutants removal and sludge settling the impacts of cip on pollutants removal in as and srb sludge systems were investigated using sbr and srusb bioreactors respectively to treat the synthetic wastewaters with influent cip concentration of 0 5000 μg l as shown in fig 2 a the influent cod was effectively removed with the average removal efficiency of 91 5 1 4 in all five phases by as system indicating no inhibition on aerobic heterotrophic microorganisms was caused by feeding cip into as system similar results were also observed that fqs cip enrofloxacin lomefloxacin ofloxacin and norfloxacin etc did not significantly affect the cod removal in an as system exposed to 500 μg l of total fqs wang et al 2018 however the nh4 n and no2 n concentrations in sbr effluent as system increased significantly p 0 05 with increasing influent cip concentration from 0 to 5000 μg l as shown in fig 2 a the influent cip posed a significant decrease of total nitrogen tn removal from 91 8 1 2 in phase i influent cip 0 μg l and effluent tn 2 02 0 30 mg l to 50 4 4 3 in phase v influent cip 5000 μg l and effluent tn 12 39 0 97 mg l it indicated that cip exposure caused metabolic inhibition and shaped the microbial community such as aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in as system yi et al 2017 amorim et al 2014 the population of aob was even found to decrease significantly with cip concentration as low as 350 ng l in a partial nitritation bench scale biofilter gonzalez martinez et al 2014 interestingly the increase of influent cip concentration from 0 to 5000 μg l stimulated cod removal and sulfate reduction significantly p 0 05 from 85 83 0 67 and 62 41 1 51 in phase i influent cip 0 μg l to 91 34 0 58 and 73 24 1 49 in phase v influent cip 5000 μg l respectively see fig 2 b the sulfate was converted into dissolved sulfide and no sulfur intermediates e g sulfite thiosulfate and elemental sulfur production achieving sulfur mass balance of 91 95 1 56 to 93 57 2 01 in srusb reactor at operation phases i v see table s3 in si in addition about 85 83 0 67 to 91 34 0 58 of cod balance were achieved in the srusb reactor during the operation and the reduced cod was mainly 81 77 1 22 to 89 69 1 57 used for sulfate reduction by srb enriched sludge in this study see table s3 in si the experimental results showed that the influent cip improved pollutants removal in anaerobic srusb bioreactor and had no inhibitory effect on the acclimatized microbes in srb sludge it could be due to some srb genera such as desulfobacter playing an important role in cod removal and sulfate reduction as the primary functional microbes after shaping the microbial community by cip exposure jia et al 2018 rabus et al 2006 the microbial community composition of as and srb sludge at different operational phases was investigated by 16s rrna high throughput sequencing in this study see section 3 3 the sludge volume index svi was also monitored for evaluating the separation of water and solids after biological wastewater treatment in this study the svi of as in sbr increased significantly p 0 05 from 98 3 ml g in phase i influent cip 0 μg l to 313 12 ml g in phase v influent cip 5000 μg l see fig s5 in si suggesting the presence of cip deteriorated the settling of as and led to a sludge bulking it will lead to the failure of sludge clarification in as process and result in the loss of biomass martins et al 2004 du et al 2018 also reported that the tetracycline significantly accelerated sludge bulking deterioration in a lab scale anaerobic aerobic wastewater treatment system however long term exposure of srb sludge to cip 0 5000 μg l had little impact on the settling of srb sludge with the average svi of 88 3 ml g at all phases indicating srb sludge is fully acclimatized with more stable and effective performance for cip and cod removal than as the different impacts of cip on as and srb sludge systems could be explained by the stress responses of as and srb sludge while exposing to cip e g microbial community shipping and eps changes which were also analyzed and the results are discussed in the subsequent sections 3 3 microbial responses in as and srb sludge the microbial communities in as and srb sludge samples at different phases were analyzed by 16s rrna high throughput sequencing to indicate the microbial responses to cip exposure fig 3 and table s4 the chao1 and ace indices were used to reveal the microbial richness and the species diversity can be revealed by shannon and simpson indices pan et al 2015 the chao 1 ace and the shannon indices decreased significantly and the simpson index increased obviously with increasing influent cip concentration in as and srb sludge system p 0 05 table s4 in si indicated that the presence of cip decreased the microbial richness and microbial diversity kong et al 2017a b the dominant microbial community dynamics of as and srb sludge at the phylum and genus level were present in fig 3 the relative abundances of phyla proteobacteria and bacteroidetes the common phyla in as kwon et al 2010 increased significantly in as system from phase i influent cip 0 μg l to phase v influent cip 5000 μg l as shown in fig 3 a however the phylum nitrospirae fig 3 a and genus nitrospira nob or complete ammonia oxidizer comammox fig 3 b was often observed in associated with no2 n and ammonia oxidation lucker et al 2010 spasov et al in press roots et al 2019 and the family nitrosomonadaceae otus in table s5 in si associated with nh4 n oxidation ding et al 2016 decreased significantly p 0 05 it well explained the increase of nh4 n and no2 n in effluent of as sludge system sbr under cip exposure the genus zoogloea increased significantly p 0 05 from 0 1 in phase i influent cip 0 μg l to 14 0 in phase v influent cip 5000 μg l and the excessive growth of zoogloea like microorganisms also characterizes the viscous non filamentous bulking of as an et al 2016 martins et al 2004 and stimulates the production of viscous eps mostly polysaccharides subramanian et al 2010 which explained the high svi values of as but little filamentous bacteria observed in as under high cip concentration in this study in srb sludge system the proteobacteria bacteroidetes and thermotogae were the predominant phyla in srb sludge samples at the end of phase i influent cip 0 μg l the selective evolution of microorganisms under cip exposure shaped the microbial communities in srb sludge samples with increasing influent cip concentration from 0 phase i to 5000 μg l phase v for example the relative abundance of phylum proteobacteria increased significantly from 22 5 phase i to 50 5 phase v but phyla bacteroidetes and thermotogae decreased from 33 1 and 15 3 phase i to 8 9 and 3 7 phase v respectively see fig 3 c the genus desulfobacter mostly belonging to proteobacteria phylum in srb sludge sample was enriched from phases i to v and became the primary genus relative abundance 31 3 in srb sludge sample at phase v influent cip 5000 μg l similarly cordova kreylos and scow 2007 reported that cip had no apparent negative effects on desulfobacter in microbial community of saline marsh sediments in addition the desulfobacter genus is highly efficient and versatile sulfate reducer and cod consumer and responsible for the high cod removal and sulfate reduction in srb sludge system exposed to high cip concentration in this study rabus et al 2006 3 4 eps changes of as and srb sludge under cip exposure it has been reported that eps can protect microbes against the harm of toxic substances such as antibiotics via adsorbing exogenous organic compounds such as antibiotics henriques and love 2007 zhang et al 2018 the eps changes of as and srb sludge under cip exposure were investigated based on the changes in eps chemical components and the structure as shown in fig 4 while increasing cip concentration the eps content increased significantly p 0 05 from 21 9 1 1 and 55 1 1 5 mg g ss to 64 1 1 2 and 86 7 mg g ss in as and srb sludge system to protect against the toxicity of cip sheng et al 2010 wang et al 2018 the abundant eps production was attributed to high relative abundance of specific genera such as zoogloea flavobacterium and acinetobacter which was reported to produce excess eps fig 3 b and d wan et al 2015 martins et al 2004 lv et al 2014 the pn and the mass ratio of pn ps which is usually used to indicate the hydrophobicity increased significantly with increasing influent cip concentration suggesting that the stronger hydrophobicity and more availability of adsorption sites for cip adsorption mei et al 2009 sheng et al 2010 it is consistent with the results that the specific adsorption of cip by eps increased significantly in these two sludge systems fig 1 c however the pn ps ratio decreased significantly with the increase of ps p 0 05 and the svi increased to 313 12 ml g in phase v in as system it was due to the significant increase of the genus zoogloea 14 0 in phase v which is reported to be responsible for the production of viscous eps an et al 2016 peng et al 2003 resulting in the deterioration of the settling of as basuvaraj et al 2015 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to track the transformation of fluorescence organic components in eps after exposure to cip as illustrated in fig 5 a j three main peaks were identified in the eem fluorescence spectrum in phase i in as and srb sludge systems the peak a was identified at excitation emissions ex em of 230 296 305 nm which is associated with tyrosine in proteins zhang et al 2018 the peak b ex em 215 225 335 350 nm and peak c ex em 270 280 335 350 nm were attributed to the aromatic amino acid substances i e tryptophan xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 the locations of these three peaks did not shift during the reactor operation suggesting the chemical components of eps did not changed significantly however the fluorescence intensities of eps were intensified with increasing influent cip concentration which is consistent with the results that the eps content especially the pn increased significantly with the increase of cip concentration in as and srb sludge systems fig 4 gu et al 2017 reported that the tryptophan was the major component of proteins in eps in biological aerated filters which increased gradually under cip stimulation the peak d ex em 320 330 410 420 nm and peak e ex em 268 273 410 420 nm identified as cip was detected in eps of as and srb sludge in phase ii to phase v and the intensities increased significantly with increasing influent cip concentration it is agreement with the results that the cip content in eps of as and srb sludge increased significantly with increasing influent cip concentration fig s3 in si suggesting that eps could provide large number of sites for cip adsorption to decrease the cip concentration contacting cells thus protecting the microbial cells against acute damage the results indicated that the tryptophan and tyrosine amino acid substances were the main components in eps to response against the cip pressure and protect microbes against toxicity of cip in as and srb sludge systems for further understanding the protective mechanisms of eps ftir spectroscopy was used to unravel the changes of functional groups of eps after long term exposure to cip as shown in fig 5 k and l similar functional groups were observed in eps of as and srb sludge since the similar components of eps from these two sludges it can be observed that the peaks intensities of c o 1616 cm 1 and n h of amine in proteins 1635 cm 1 decreased with increasing cip concentration indicated that part of c o and n h groups in eps of as and srb sludge were involved in cip adsorption jain et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 the peak intensities at the region of 3413 3550 cm 1 associated with o h vibration gradually decreased under cip pressure suggesting that o h group in eps also provided active adsorption sites for cip in these two sludge systems zhang et al 2018 in addition the peaks of c o c also became weaker with the increase of cip concentration due to the binding of eps with cip however the peaks at 1396 cm 1 corresponded to coo stretches possibly was associated with uronic acid mu et al 2012 the intensities of which remained unchanged indicating that the polysaccharide like substances were not involved in cip adsorption our results show that the locations of these peaks did not change much but the relative intensities of these peaks decreased obviously with the increase of cip concentration from 0 to 5000 μg l suggested these functional groups i e n h o h c o c and c o in eps were bound with cip zhang et al 2018 the adsorption of cip with eps could retard the diffusion of cip to cells and protecting the microbial cells against acute damage wang et al 2018 4 conclusions our results systematically examined the stress responses of activated sludge as and sulfate reducing bacteria srb sludge systems under ciprofloxacin cip exposure the results showed that srb sludge exhibited sustainable and efficient removal of cip from the aqueous phase with biodegradation as the main pathway while there existed low cip removal and desorption in as since the only adsorption involved in cip removal the presence of cip decreased the richness and the diversity of the microbes in as and srb sludge and significantly p 0 05 inhibited nitrogen removal in as system due to the decrease of family nitrosomonadaceae aob and genus nitrospira nob and comammox that associated with nitrogen removal in addition the significant increase of the genus zoogloea under cip exposure induced the non filamentous bulking of as the enrichment of genus desulfobacter in srb sludge under cip exposure facilitated the cod removal and sulfate reduction the increase of the genera zoogloea acinetobacter and flavobacterium with increasing influent cip concentration promoted extensive eps production to protect microbes against the cip damage the tryptophan and tyrosine amino acid substances were the main components in eps that involved in protective role the binding of cip with the functional groups n h o h c o c and c o in eps impeded the direct contact of cip with cells and protect the microbes against the cip toxicity these results showed the high tolerance and removal

18571,the activated sludge as and sulfate reducing bacteria srb sludge systems were continuously operated for 200 days in laboratory to investigate the stress responses of these two sludge systems under ciprofloxacin cip exposure it was found that cip was effectively removed by srb sludge via adsorption and biodegradation but little biodegradation in as system the cip biodegradation by srb sludge made the srb sludge system more sustainable and tolerant to long term cip exposure than as system with significant p 0 05 cip desorption and decrease of cip removal cip shaped the microbial communities in as and srb sludge and significantly p 0 05 inhibited the family nitrosomonadaceae ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and genus nitrospira nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob complete ammonia oxidizer comammox and the nitrogen removal in as system moreover cip posed the increase of genus zoogloea like organisms and the non filamentous bulking of as e g 313 12 ml g of sludge volume index svi at phase v influent cip 5000 μg l the genus desulfobacter was enriched in srb sludge system under long term cip exposure and stimulated chemical oxygen demand cod removal and sulfate reduction the increase of genera zoogloea acinetobacter and flavobacterium in as and zoogloea and acinetobacter in srb sludge systems under cip exposure promoted extracellular polymeric substances eps production and cip adsorption for self protection of microbes against cip toxicity the functional groups of n h o h c o c and c o in eps of as and srb sludge provided adsorption sites for cip and impeded cip impact on microbial cells the findings of this study provide an insight into the stress responses of as and srb sludge under long term cip exposure and exhibit the great potential of treating cip laden wastewater by srb sludge system graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotics activated sludge as sulfate reducing bacteria srb extracellular polymeric substances eps microbial community 1 introduction ciprofloxacin cip is one of the broad spectrum fluoroquinolones fqs with antibacterial properties against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria kuemmerer 2009 porras et al 2016 it is widely used in the treatment of tuberculosis gastrointestinal urinary tract and respiratory tract infections of humans and as veterinary medicine to prevent or treat infectious diseases werner et al 2010 liu et al 2012 mackiw et al 2012 however cip ingested into the body can be partially metabolized and largely up to 72 excreted in its pharmacologically active form zhang et al 2015 cip has been widely detected in surface water 1 8 2150 ng l zhang et al 2015 groundwater 5 3 443 ng l jurado et al 2019 and effluent 7 15 670 ng l of wastewater treatment plants michael et al 2013 the occurrence and persistence of cip in the environmental media may pose a high ecotoxicity to various aquatic organisms including vibrio fischeri microcystis aeruginosa and synechococcus leopoliensis zhang et al 2012 cip toxicity towards other organisms including microcystis aeruginosa and lemna minor with the half maximal effective concentration of 17 μg l and 203 μg l respectively has also been reported robinson et al 2005 in addition the cip may also cause the physiological teratogenesis of plants algae and be genotoxic carcinogenic for organisms toolaram et al 2016 xiong et al 2017 even low concentration of cip can lead to the emergence and propagation of antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes posing threats to the environment and human health huijbers et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 although the activated sludge as process has been applied in wastewater treatment for more than one hundred years it is still the main process in municipal wastewater treatment plants of china ben et al 2018 liu and wong 2013 however recently several novel sulfur mediated biological processes were developed and applied for saline sewage treatment lu et al 2011 nitrate contaminated groundwater remediation liang et al 2018 pu et al 2014 and antibiotics laden wastewater treatment jia et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the pollutants chemical oxygen demand cod n p in wastewater are transformed in the sulfur mediated biological process with an energy saving and efficient electron transport way compared to conventional as process lu et al 2011 2012 the first full scale saline sewage treatment plant employing the sulfate reducing and sulfur driven autotrophic denitrifying processes was built up and successfully applied for saline sewage treatment in hong kong shatin sewage treatment works in 2015 wu et al 2016 in this process sulfate acts as an electron acceptor for organics removal by anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria srb and sulfide acts as an electron donor for nitrogen removal via sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification process by sulfide oxidizing bacteria in an anoxic reactor rabus et al 2006 lu et al 2012 the sulfur mediated biological process also showed a good potential for treating antibiotics laden wastewaters chelliapan and sallis 2015 jia et al 2017 2019 zhang et al 2018 studies have reported that antibiotics can inhibit the activity of microorganisms and affect the biological cod and nitrogen removal in as process due to their toxicity to microorganisms amorim et al 2014 yi et al 2017 gonzalez martinez et al 2014 in addition antibiotics can shape the microbial community composition selectively and deteriorate the sludge activity and settling in the as process amorim et al 2014 du et al 2018 wang et al 2018 for example denitrification was significantly inhibited by cip with a concentration range of 20 10 603 μg l in the as process amorim et al 2014 nguyen et al 2019 in addition ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob population decreased significantly at 350

polymers produced by microorganisms regarded as natural barrier to protect cells against the unfavorable circumstances e g antibiotics intrusion kong et al 2017a b wang et al 2018 the microbial consortia could secrete more eps to protect microbial cells against the toxicity of antibiotics or relieve the inhibition effects since eps can provide adsorption sites for toxicants kong et al 2017a b xu et al 2013 sheng et al 2010 eps are also the important indicator for physicochemical properties of biological sludge e g abilities of flocculation and settling christensen et al 2015 sheng et al 2010 however there are very limited studies on the stress responses of as and srb sludge exposed to the cip laden wastewater therefore the overarching goal of this study is to compare the stress responses of as and srb sludge while treating cip laden wastewater and elucidate the underlying mechanism of self protection against toxicity of cip the cip removal was investigated in as and srb sludge systems through continuously operated bioreactors and batch experiments the chronic effects of cip on as and srb sludge systems were evaluated based on the overall performances of these two sludge systems under cip exposure influent cip from 100 to 5000 μg l the stress responses of as and srb sludge exposed to cip were indicated by the microbial community variations and the eps changes in these two sludge systems respectively the findings of this study provide insights into the stress responses of as and srb sludge to cip for the first time and highlight the potential of sulfur mediated biological processes for antibiotics laden wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactors setup and operation two bioreactors namely sequencing batch reactor sbr working volume of 4 0 l and sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb working volume of 1 08 l see fig s1 in supplementary information si were seeded with activated sludge as and sulfate reducing bacteria srb sludge respectively the same synthetic wastewater except sulfate was fed into as and srb sludge bioreactors respectively more details for influent characterization in tables s1 and s2 and pages s5 s6 in si the two bioreactors were operated side by side continuously for 200 days with cip dosage in influent 0 5000 μg l to examine cip removal and chronic effects of cip dosage on as and srb sludge systems in the first 40 days phase i the as and srb sludge were acclimated by feeding the synthetic wastewater no cip addition into sbr and srusb reactors respectively cip 99 purity saint louis mo usa was then dosed into the influent and the two reactors were further operated for another 160 days with different influent cip concentrations 100 3 8 μg l from days 41 80 phase ii 500 7 1 μg l from days 81 120 phase iii 1000 11 3 μg l from days 121 160 phase iv and 5000 15 8 μg l from days 161 200 phase v see pages s5 s6 in si for details the range of cip concentration 100 5000 μg l was examined since it covers the cip concentrations reported in municipal pharmaceutical and hospital wastewaters lindberg et al 2004 guo et al 2017 the influent cip contributed very little cod in this study because even 5000 μg l of cip the highest influent cip concentration merely accounted for 2 of influent cod the solids retention time srt of sbr and srusb bioreactors were 10 and 20 days respectively and each operational phase 40 days enclosed 2 srts at least see pages s4 s6 in si for operational details of two bioreactors the steady state of bioreactors can be indicated by reactor performance i e concentrations of cod cip nitrogen and sulfate in effluent the influent and effluent of each reactor were collected daily for analyses of cod cip nitrogen in sbr sulfate and sulfide in srusb concentrations in aqueous phase to evaluate the performances of these two bioreactors under cip exposure in addition the cip content in suspended sludge samples were analyzed every four days to examine the fate of cip in as and srb sludge systems respectively the cip removal efficiency and specific removal rate at different operational phases of sbr and srusb reactors were determined respectively see pages s6 s7 in si for details the srusb reactor was tightly sealed with gas collection and little biogas was collected and detected in this study 2 2 batch experiments for cip adsorption and biodegradation by as and srb sludge a series of batch experiments were designed to investigate the adsorption and biodegradation of cip by as and srb sludge the sludge used in batch experiments were taken from the above mentioned sbr and srusb reactors after 200 days operation respectively before the batch experiments the as and srb sludge were firstly washed three times with 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 2 until the cip content in the sludge samples was undetectable the prepared sludge was transferred into a series of identical 300 ml serum bottles working volume of 250 ml with average suspended solids ss concentration of 1 0 0 1 g l in each serum bottle the control tests were also conducted with no as or srb sludge addition but only synthetic wastewater to examine the possible volatilization and hydrolysis of cip initial cip concentration of 5000 μg l in each serum bottle each serum bottle was wrapped with aluminum foil to avoid photodegradation the serum bottles with as were aerated to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration of 4 0 mg l during the batch experiments the serum bottles with srb sludge were firstly purged with pure nitrogen gas purity 99 99 for 30 min and then tightly sealed to establish an anaerobic condition the complete mixing in each serum bottle was achieved by magnetic stirring plate 200 rpm ika rct germany the batch experiments were continuously conducted for 5 days in triplicate at temperature of 25 0 5 c with an initial ph of 7 0 and cip concentration of 5000 μg l during the batch experiments 2 ml sample of sludge mixture was regularly withdrawn for determining the cip contents in aqueous phase eps and sludge after eps extraction the methodology used for analyzing cip adsorption by eps and sludge after eps extraction

according to the extraction method used in this study see page s9 in si for more details li and yang 2007 the variations of eps content and composition were investigated by chemistry and spectroscopy analyses to indicate the stress responses of microbes exposed to cip in sbr and srusb bioreactors respectively the polysaccharides ps were measured by phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard dubois et al 1956 yu et al 2019 the proteins pn and humic acid contents were determined by modified lowry method bovine serum albumin and humic acid were used as the standards respectively frolund et al 1995 wang et al 2015 however almost no humic acid was detected in eps of as and srb sludge samples in this study which is confirmed by the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectra of eps in fig 5 that no humic acid fluorescence spectrum was found the 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to examine the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of eps in as and srb sludge samples collected from sbr and srusb reactors respectively at different phases details of eem spectral analysis are given in page s9 in si moreover the fourier transform infrared ftir

16s rrna database using a confidence threshold of 80 2 3 4 statistical analyses in this study all samples were analyzed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation the experimental results obtained from the bioreactors operation batch experiments and microbial population analysis were statistically analyzed to examine the significant difference the data obtained from the bioreactors operation and batch experiments were performed normal distribution tests and the results showed that the data fitted well with normal distribution with the correlation coefficients range of 0 976 0 994 the variance analysis was conducted using spss 16 0 ibm armonk ny to determine the statistical significance of the results with the least significant difference below 0 05 p 0 05 jia et al 2018 the determination limit of cip was 5 μg l with the signal to noise ratio of 3 the quantitation limit of cip was 10 μg l with the signal to noise ratio of 10 the solid phase extraction method used for the cip extraction from sludge samples and analysis method for cip concentration in aqueous phase were verified with the recovery rates of 88 3 0 2 and 97 2 0 5 and the good reproducibility within the relative standard deviations of 6 n 3 and 2 n 3 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption and biodegradation of cip in as and srb sludge systems the experimental results in abiotic control tests indicated that cip cannot be removed via volatilization or hydrolysis see fig s2 in si therefore cip removal in as and srb sludge systems is primarily via adsorption and biodegradation in this study see fig 1 cip was mainly adsorbed by eps and sludge after eps extraction in as system in an sbr continuously operated for 200 days five phases i v totally and almost no cip biodegradation was observed as shown in fig 1 a similarly liu et al 2013a reported that cip was mainly removed by adsorption and a low extent of cip biotransformation in aerobic cultures due to the inhibitory effect of cip furthermore the cip biodegradation observed by li and zhang 2010 was mainly attributed to fqs degrading bacteria which only existed in saline activated sludge while increasing the influent cip concentration from 0 phase i to 5000 μg l phase v the specific removal rate of cip by as system increased significantly p 0 05 from 32 9 5 4 to 734 2 19 6 μg g ss d fig 1 c nevertheless the removal efficiency of cip in as system decreased from 66 2 8 6 to 29 7 2 0 fig 1 a since the adsorption capacity of as cannot be re generated through cip biodegradation and releasing more adsorption sites on as zhang et al 2018 which can be verified by the cip accumulation in eps and sludge after eps extraction of as see fig s3 in si compared to as system cip removal by srb sludge system was more effective with the removal efficiency of 64 1 1 2 and the specific removal rate of 1154 7 32 6 μg g ss d at phase v 5000 μg l which can be attributed to a significant p 0 05 increase of biodegradation capacity of cip by srb sludge after long term acclimation fig 1 b and c it is important to point out that the specific adsorption rates of cip by eps of as and srb sludge increased significantly from 6 3 1 3 and 3 0 0 4 μg g ss d in phase ii influent cip 100 μg l to 299 2 8 5 and 323 9 11 4 μg g ss d in phase v influent cip 5000 μg l respectively as shown in fig 1 c these results indicated that eps play an important role in adsorbing cip and protecting the microbial cells in as and srb sludge against the toxicity of antibiotics as a natural barrier kong et al 2017a b xu et al 2013 gu et al 2017 as the stress response of biological sludge the eps content excreted by as and srb microbes was also analyzed in this study the cip transport and biodegradation in as and srb sludge were further investigated through a series of batch tests see fig 1 d e and f and fig s4 in si about 83 5 1 3 and 92 1 1 6 of cip in aqueous phase initial cip concentration of 5000 μg l was quickly adsorbed in the first 15 min with the specific adsorption of 4 1 0 2 and 4 6 0 3 μg mg ss by as and srb sludge respectively the cip was significantly p 0 05 transported into eps of as from aqueous phase and sludge after eps extraction in the first 12 h of batch tests as shown in fig 1 d however the cip was significantly desorbed from as into aqueous phase after 12 h of batch tests since little cip can be biodegraded by as and the unstable adsorption equilibrium of cip onto as zhang et al 2018 see fig 1 d and f the srb sludge exhibited a good removal of cip from the aqueous phase with biodegradation as the main pathway see fig 1 e and f however liu et al 2013b reported that no significant cip degradation was found in a sulfate reducing culture this difference may be due to the enrichment of functional microbes involved in cip degradation in srb sludge system after a long term cip acclimation compared with sulfate reducing culture without cip acclimation the transformation products tps of cip by srb sludge were examined in the batch tests and four possible biodegradation pathways of cip by srb sludge were proposed fig s4 in si in pathway a the cip was transformed into tp1 via removing c2h2 at the piperazinyl substituent via desethylation reaction and subsequently the tp2 was generated via loss of a c2h5n fragment of tp1 cvancarova et al 2015 prieto et al 2011 in pathway b the hydroxylation in position c 5 of cip resulted in the generation of tp3 and then the hydroxylation in position c 7 of cip replaced the piperazinyl group of tp3 and transformed tp3 into tp4 fig s4 in si in pathways c and d the hydroxylation in position c 6 and c 3 replaced fluorine and carboxyl group respectively to transform cip into tp5 and tp6 respectively fig s4 in si the results indicated that cip was biodegraded intracellularly via desethylation reaction in piperazinyl ring and hydroxylation reaction and six tps were detected fig s4 in si 3 2 cip impacts on pollutants removal and sludge settling the impacts of cip on pollutants removal in as and srb sludge systems were investigated using sbr and srusb bioreactors respectively to treat the synthetic wastewaters with influent cip concentration of 0 5000 μg l as shown in fig 2 a the influent cod was effectively removed with the average removal efficiency of 91 5 1 4 in all five phases by as system indicating no inhibition on aerobic heterotrophic microorganisms was caused by feeding cip into as system similar results were also observed that fqs cip enrofloxacin lomefloxacin ofloxacin and norfloxacin etc did not significantly affect the cod removal in an as system exposed to 500 μg l of total fqs wang et al 2018 however the nh4 n and no2 n concentrations in sbr effluent as system increased significantly p 0 05 with increasing influent cip concentration from 0 to 5000 μg l as shown in fig 2 a the influent cip posed a significant decrease of total nitrogen tn removal from 91 8 1 2 in phase i influent cip 0 μg l and effluent tn 2 02 0 30 mg l to 50 4 4 3 in phase v influent cip 5000 μg l and effluent tn 12 39 0 97 mg l it indicated that cip exposure caused metabolic inhibition and shaped the microbial community such as aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in as system yi et al 2017 amorim et al 2014 the population of aob was even found to decrease significantly with cip concentration as low as 350 ng l in a partial nitritation bench scale biofilter gonzalez martinez et al 2014 interestingly the increase of influent cip concentration from 0 to 5000 μg l stimulated cod removal and sulfate reduction significantly p 0 05 from 85 83 0 67 and 62 41 1 51 in phase i influent cip 0 μg l to 91 34 0 58 and 73 24 1 49 in phase v influent cip 5000 μg l respectively see fig 2 b the sulfate was converted into dissolved sulfide and no sulfur intermediates e g sulfite thiosulfate and elemental sulfur production achieving sulfur mass balance of 91 95 1 56 to 93 57 2 01 in srusb reactor at operation phases i v see table s3 in si in addition about 85 83 0 67 to 91 34 0 58 of cod balance were achieved in the srusb reactor during the operation and the reduced cod was mainly 81 77 1 22 to 89 69 1 57 used for sulfate reduction by srb enriched sludge in this study see table s3 in si the experimental results showed that the influent cip improved pollutants removal in anaerobic srusb bioreactor and had no inhibitory effect on the acclimatized microbes in srb sludge it could be due to some srb genera such as desulfobacter playing an important role in cod removal and sulfate reduction as the primary functional microbes after shaping the microbial community by cip exposure jia et al 2018 rabus et al 2006 the microbial community composition of as and srb sludge at different operational phases was investigated by 16s rrna high throughput sequencing in this study see section 3 3 the sludge volume index svi was also monitored for evaluating the separation of water and solids after biological wastewater treatment in this study the svi of as in sbr increased significantly p 0 05 from 98 3 ml g in phase i influent cip 0 μg l to 313 12 ml g in phase v influent cip 5000 μg l see fig s5 in si suggesting the presence of cip deteriorated the settling of as and led to a sludge bulking it will lead to the failure of sludge clarification in as process and result in the loss of biomass martins et al 2004 du et al 2018 also reported that the tetracycline significantly accelerated sludge bulking deterioration in a lab scale anaerobic aerobic wastewater treatment system however long term exposure of srb sludge to cip 0 5000 μg l had little impact on the settling of srb sludge with the average svi of 88 3 ml g at all phases indicating srb sludge is fully acclimatized with more stable and effective performance for cip and cod removal than as the different impacts of cip on as and srb sludge systems could be explained by the stress responses of as and srb sludge while exposing to cip e g microbial community shipping and eps changes which were also analyzed and the results are discussed in the subsequent sections 3 3 microbial responses in as and srb sludge the microbial communities in as and srb sludge samples at different phases were analyzed by 16s rrna high throughput sequencing to indicate the microbial responses to cip exposure fig 3 and table s4 the chao1 and ace indices were used to reveal the microbial richness and the species diversity can be revealed by shannon and simpson indices pan et al 2015 the chao 1 ace and the shannon indices decreased significantly and the simpson index increased obviously with increasing influent cip concentration in as and srb sludge system p 0 05 table s4 in si indicated that the presence of cip decreased the microbial richness and microbial diversity kong et al 2017a b the dominant microbial community dynamics of as and srb sludge at the phylum and genus level were present in fig 3 the relative abundances of phyla proteobacteria and bacteroidetes the common phyla in as kwon et al 2010 increased significantly in as system from phase i influent cip 0 μg l to phase v influent cip 5000 μg l as shown in fig 3 a however the phylum nitrospirae fig 3 a and genus nitrospira nob or complete ammonia oxidizer comammox fig 3 b was often observed in associated with no2 n and ammonia oxidation lucker et al 2010 spasov et al in press roots et al 2019 and the family nitrosomonadaceae otus in table s5 in si associated with nh4 n oxidation ding et al 2016 decreased significantly p 0 05 it well explained the increase of nh4 n and no2 n in effluent of as sludge system sbr under cip exposure the genus zoogloea increased significantly p 0 05 from 0 1 in phase i influent cip 0 μg l to 14 0 in phase v influent cip 5000 μg l and the excessive growth of zoogloea like microorganisms also characterizes the viscous non filamentous bulking of as an et al 2016 martins et al 2004 and stimulates the production of viscous eps mostly polysaccharides subramanian et al 2010 which explained the high svi values of as but little filamentous bacteria observed in as under high cip concentration in this study in srb sludge system the proteobacteria bacteroidetes and thermotogae were the predominant phyla in srb sludge samples at the end of phase i influent cip 0 μg l the selective evolution of microorganisms under cip exposure shaped the microbial communities in srb sludge samples with increasing influent cip concentration from 0 phase i to 5000 μg l phase v for example the relative abundance of phylum proteobacteria increased significantly from 22 5 phase i to 50 5 phase v but phyla bacteroidetes and thermotogae decreased from 33 1 and 15 3 phase i to 8 9 and 3 7 phase v respectively see fig 3 c the genus desulfobacter mostly belonging to proteobacteria phylum in srb sludge sample was enriched from phases i to v and became the primary genus relative abundance 31 3 in srb sludge sample at phase v influent cip 5000 μg l similarly cordova kreylos and scow 2007 reported that cip had no apparent negative effects on desulfobacter in microbial community of saline marsh sediments in addition the desulfobacter genus is highly efficient and versatile sulfate reducer and cod consumer and responsible for the high cod removal and sulfate reduction in srb sludge system exposed to high cip concentration in this study rabus et al 2006 3 4 eps changes of as and srb sludge under cip exposure it has been reported that eps can protect microbes against the harm of toxic substances such as antibiotics via adsorbing exogenous organic compounds such as antibiotics henriques and love 2007 zhang et al 2018 the eps changes of as and srb sludge under cip exposure were investigated based on the changes in eps chemical components and the structure as shown in fig 4 while increasing cip concentration the eps content increased significantly p 0 05 from 21 9 1 1 and 55 1 1 5 mg g ss to 64 1 1 2 and 86 7 mg g ss in as and srb sludge system to protect against the toxicity of cip sheng et al 2010 wang et al 2018 the abundant eps production was attributed to high relative abundance of specific genera such as zoogloea flavobacterium and acinetobacter which was reported to produce excess eps fig 3 b and d wan et al 2015 martins et al 2004 lv et al 2014 the pn and the mass ratio of pn ps which is usually used to indicate the hydrophobicity increased significantly with increasing influent cip concentration suggesting that the stronger hydrophobicity and more availability of adsorption sites for cip adsorption mei et al 2009 sheng et al 2010 it is consistent with the results that the specific adsorption of cip by eps increased significantly in these two sludge systems fig 1 c however the pn ps ratio decreased significantly with the increase of ps p 0 05 and the svi increased to 313 12 ml g in phase v in as system it was due to the significant increase of the genus zoogloea 14 0 in phase v which is reported to be responsible for the production of viscous eps an et al 2016 peng et al 2003 resulting in the deterioration of the settling of as basuvaraj et al 2015 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to track the transformation of fluorescence organic components in eps after exposure to cip as illustrated in fig 5 a j three main peaks were identified in the eem fluorescence spectrum in phase i in as and srb sludge systems the peak a was identified at excitation emissions ex em of 230 296 305 nm which is associated with tyrosine in proteins zhang et al 2018 the peak b ex em 215 225 335 350 nm and peak c ex em 270 280 335 350 nm were attributed to the aromatic amino acid substances i e tryptophan xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 the locations of these three peaks did not shift during the reactor operation suggesting the chemical components of eps did not changed significantly however the fluorescence intensities of eps were intensified with increasing influent cip concentration which is consistent with the results that the eps content especially the pn increased significantly with the increase of cip concentration in as and srb sludge systems fig 4 gu et al 2017 reported that the tryptophan was the major component of proteins in eps in biological aerated filters which increased gradually under cip stimulation the peak d ex em 320 330 410 420 nm and peak e ex em 268 273 410 420 nm identified as cip was detected in eps of as and srb sludge in phase ii to phase v and the intensities increased significantly with increasing influent cip concentration it is agreement with the results that the cip content in eps of as and srb sludge increased significantly with increasing influent cip concentration fig s3 in si suggesting that eps could provide large number of sites for cip adsorption to decrease the cip concentration contacting cells thus protecting the microbial cells against acute damage the results indicated that the tryptophan and tyrosine amino acid substances were the main components in eps to response against the cip pressure and protect microbes against toxicity of cip in as and srb sludge systems for further understanding the protective mechanisms of eps ftir spectroscopy was used to unravel the changes of functional groups of eps after long term exposure to cip as shown in fig 5 k and l similar functional groups were observed in eps of as and srb sludge since the similar components of eps from these two sludges it can be observed that the peaks intensities of c o 1616 cm 1 and n h of amine in proteins 1635 cm 1 decreased with increasing cip concentration indicated that part of c o and n h groups in eps of as and srb sludge were involved in cip adsorption jain et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 the peak intensities at the region of 3413 3550 cm 1 associated with o h vibration gradually decreased under cip pressure suggesting that o h group in eps also provided active adsorption sites for cip in these two sludge systems zhang et al 2018 in addition the peaks of c o c also became weaker with the increase of cip concentration due to the binding of eps with cip however the peaks at 1396 cm 1 corresponded to coo stretches possibly was associated with uronic acid mu et al 2012 the intensities of which remained unchanged indicating that the polysaccharide like substances were not involved in cip adsorption our results show that the locations of these peaks did not change much but the relative intensities of these peaks decreased obviously with the increase of cip concentration from 0 to 5000 μg l suggested these functional groups i e n h o h c o c and c o in eps were bound with cip zhang et al 2018 the adsorption of cip with eps could retard the diffusion of cip to cells and protecting the microbial cells against acute damage wang et al 2018 4 conclusions our results systematically examined the stress responses of activated sludge as and sulfate reducing bacteria srb sludge systems under ciprofloxacin cip exposure the results showed that srb sludge exhibited sustainable and efficient removal of cip from the aqueous phase with biodegradation as the main pathway while there existed low cip removal and desorption in as since the only adsorption involved in cip removal the presence of cip decreased the richness and the diversity of the microbes in as and srb sludge and significantly p 0 05 inhibited nitrogen removal in as system due to the decrease of family nitrosomonadaceae aob and genus nitrospira nob and comammox that associated with nitrogen removal in addition the significant increase of the genus zoogloea under cip exposure induced the non filamentous bulking of as the enrichment of genus desulfobacter in srb sludge under cip exposure facilitated the cod removal and sulfate reduction the increase of the genera zoogloea acinetobacter and flavobacterium with increasing influent cip concentration promoted extensive eps production to protect microbes against the cip damage the tryptophan and tyrosine amino acid substances were the main components in eps that involved in protective role the binding of cip with the functional groups n h o h c o c and c o in eps impeded the direct contact of cip with cells and protect the microbes against the cip toxicity these results showed the high tolerance and removal

18572,iron chelators are often used to improve the performance of fe ii activated peroxides e g peroxydisulfate pds and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 for oxidative water treatment over a wide ph range due to the enhanced solubility of iron in the presence of chelators at high ph in this study we compared the effect of various chelators on the production and nature of the reactive intermediate formed in fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems by using methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso as a probe which could distinguish ferryl ion fe iv from free radicals oh and so4 due to their marked difference in product formation six representative chelators oxalate acid oa citric acid ca nitrilotriacetic acid nta ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta pyrophosphate ppp and tetrapolyphosphate tpp which covered the commonly used polycarboxylates aminocarboxylates and polyphosphates ligands were selected in chelator assisted fe ii pds systems the highest pmso transformation efficiency at ph 3 9 was obtained in cases with polycarboxylates due to their higher reactivity to pds activation lower steric hindrance and stronger ability in promoting fe ii fe iii cycle comparatively in chelator assisted fe ii h2o2 systems tpp addition achieved the best performance in pmso transformation at ph 5 moreover the yield of fe iv indicative product methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 decreased with increasing chelator fe ii molar ratio but was independent on ph in cases of pds indicating that chelator altered reactive intermediate nature from fe iv to so4 and fe iv yield was not sensitive to ph in cases of h2o2 chelator decreased pmso2 production while promoting pmso loss at near neutral ph suggesting that fe ii chelator complexes also tended to catalyze h2o2 to generate oh rather than fe iv graphical abstract image

advanced oxidation processes aops in remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater devi et al 2016 ike et al 2018 liu et al 2018 activation of pds can be achieved by several methods using uv xie et al 2015 heat zrinyi and pham 2017 alkaline furman et al 2010 and transition metals e g fe ii ag i co ii and cu ii anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 owing to the cost effective high catalytic activity and environmental friendly nature fe ii is one of the most promising pds activator for engineering application wu et al 2014 it has been demonstrated in our recent work that the primary reactive intermediate formed in the fe ii pds system is ferryl ion species fe iv rather than long recognized sulfate radical so4 by using methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso as a probe wang et al 2018 2019 it was firstly identified that pmso could be transferred to its corresponding sulfones methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 by feivo2 eq 1 while so4 oxidized pmso to produce biphenyl compounds rather than pmso2 eq 2 similar to the case of oh wang et al 2018 1 2 contrary to literature expectation pmso2 product was formed when pmso was treated by the fe ii pds system at acidic and neutral ph and the yield of pmso2 i e η pmso2 the molar ratio of pmso2 produced to pmso lost was quantified to be 100 at acidic ph this result indicated that fe iv was the dominant reactive intermediate formed in the fe ii pds system under acidic conditions and fe iv also occurred at circumneutral ph eq 3 wang et al 2018 3 fe2 s2o8 2 h2o feⅳo2 2so4 2 2h k 2 0 101 m 1s 1 due to the precipitation of iron at neutral and alkaline ph the fe ii pds system was inefficiency therein rastogi et al 2009 han et al 2015 to enhance the performance of the fe ii pds system on eliminating contaminants at high ph iron chelators are often used to solubilize iron keenan and sedlak 2008a rastogi et al 2009 han et al 2015 miller et al 2016 the commonly used iron chelators can be categorized into three types including the polycarboxylates e g oxalate acid oa citric acid ca aminocarboxylates e g nitrilotriacetic acid nta ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and phosphates ligands e g pyrophosphate ppp tetrapolyphosphate tpp according to their coordination sites i e carboxyl amino or phosphate group although some researchers have comparatively investigated the effect of several chelators on reactive intermediate production in the fe ii pds system no proper buffer was used in these studies which affected the actual solution ph or competitively coordinated with iron e g phosphate buffer liang et al 2004 rastogi et al 2009 han et al 2015 therefore a systematic re evaluation of the influence of chelator on reactive intermediate production in fe ii pds system with careful ph control is required moreover limited information is available on the nature of the reactive intermediate formed in the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems comparatively the nature of the reactive intermediate formed in the fe ii activated hydrogen peroxide h2o2 process in the presence and absence of chelators have been extensively investigated by invoking sulfoxides e g dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and pmso as a probe it was demonstrated that hydroxyl radical oh was the primary intermediate generated in the fe ii h2o2 system under acidic conditions eq 4a while the reactive intermediate shifted to fe iv at near neutral ph eq 4b bataineh et al 2012 wang et al 2018 4a h2o2 fe2 oh oh fe3 k 7 6 101 m 1s 1 4b h2o2 fe2 h2o feivo2 however contradictory conclusions on the nature of reactive intermediate formed in the chelator assisted fe ii h2o2 systems were obtained in literature take the case of edta for example some researchers reported that fe iv was the reactive intermediate produced in edta assisted fe ii h2o2 system at near neutral ph rush and koppenol 1986 while others identified oh as the primary intermediate miller et al 2016 or found a mixture of oh and fe iv under circumneutral condition yamazaki and piette 1991 a similar conflicting conclusion was also obtained in the fe ii h2o2 system assisted by other chelators such as oa park et al 1997 keenan and sedlak 2008a thomas et al 2016 chen et al 2018 nta keenan and sedlak 2008a dao and de laat 2011 and tpp wang et al 2015 kim et al 2015 2017 miller et al 2016 concluded that the limitations of the common methods for the identification of the reactive intermediates e g alcohol scavenging experiments electron spin resonance spectroscopy and kinetic model analysis prevented these studies from getting a definitive conclusion the current study aims to explore the effect of six representative iron chelators oa ca nta edta ppp and tpp see scheme 1 for their binding sites on the production and nature of the reactive intermediate formed in the fe ii pds system by invoking pmso as a probe firstly pds decomposition and pmso loss were quantitatively measured under different chelator fe ii molar ratios and ph to evaluate the chelator influence on intermediate production moreover the formation of fe iv indicative product pmso2 was monitored under various conditions in an attempt to explore the effect of chelator on altering the reactive oxidant

magnetic stirring solutions at ph 3 no buffer were adjusted by adding hclo4 sodium acetate buffer 5 mm was used for ph 4 and 5 sodium borate buffer 5 mm was used for ph 7 and 9 these buffers were used because they do not form complexes with iron the ph varied by less than 0 2 units during the reaction samples 950 μl were withdrawn at certain time intervals and immediately quenched by adding 50 μl dmso before analysis by high pressure liquid chromatography hplc for pmso and pmso2 all experiments were performed at 20 c in triplicates and the mean values with standard deviations were presented 2 2 2 experiments in real waters two real waters were used in this work including surface water and wastewater effluent from a municipal sewage plant these water samples were filtered through 1 μm filter the physicochemical properties of these real waters were listed in table s1 reactions were initiated by adding the prepared fe ii chelator complex solution chelator 0 fe ii 0 50 100 μm to the real water matrices following the similar procedure to that in synthetic solutions 2 3 analytical methods concentrations of pds were measured with a modified iodometric method liang et al 2008 concentrations of h2o2 were determined spectrophotometrically using an n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd peroxidase method bader et al 1998 pmso and pmso2 were analyzed by waters 1525 hplc with uv detection at 230 and 215 nm respectively chromatographic separations were performed on a waters symmetry c18 column 150 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm using a binary mixture of acetonitrile and water containing 0 1 acetic acid as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of chelator concentration on pds decomposition and pmso loss in the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems at ph 3 3 1 1 polycarboxylate chelators oa and ca 3 1 1 1 pds decomposition oxalate acid and citric acid contain two and three carboxyl dentates respectively and thus they will completely chelate fe ii to form a hexacoordinated complex at chelator fe ii molar ratio of 3 1 or 2 1 han et al 2015 accordingly the effect of chelator initial concentration chelator 0 on pds decomposition and pmso 50 μm transformation in the fe ii pds 100 500 μm system was studied at six chelator fe ii molar ratios of 0 1 0 5 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 and 5 1 at ph 3 in the oa assisted fe ii pds system within the investigated time 90 min pds decomposition i e δ pds t increased from about 100 to 182 μm with increasing oa 0 fe ii 0 from 0 1 to 2 1 and then dramatically decreased to 108 μm with oa 0 fe ii 0 further increasing to 5 1 table 1 as for the ca assisted fe ii pds system δ pds t was significantly promoted from 100 to 320 μm with increasing ca 0 fe ii 0 from 0 1 to 5 1 and it was much higher than that in the oa assisted cases at each chelator 0 fe ii 0 molar ratios table 1 similar to the study of han et al 2015 the acceleration of pds decomposition by addition of appropriate oa and ca could be attributed to the following reasons i oa fe ii and ca fe ii complexes show higher reactivity than aqueous fe ii toward pds activation similar to the oa and ca assisted fe ii h2o2 systems for example the reaction rate of feii c2o4 with h2o2 3 104 m 1s 1 is almost 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of aqueous fe ii with h2o2 7 6 101 m 1s 1 balmer and sulzberger 1999 and ii the oa and ca oxidation intermediates facilitated the reduction of fe iii to fe ii through the following radical chain reactions eqs 5 10 which further promoted pds decomposition specifically polycarboxylate chelators r cooh were oxidized by the reactive intermediate s fe iv and or so4 eqs 5 and 6 to produce carboxyl anion radicals co2 or alkyl radicals r depending on the attack sites of carboxylates by reactive intermediate s oxidation see details in text s1 jacobsen et al 1998 pestovsky and bakac 2004 criquet and leitner 2009 thomas et al 2016 chen et al 2018 pang et al 2019 5 feivo2 r cooh fe3 co2 r intermediates 6 so4 r cooh so4 2 co2 r intermediates subsequently co2 and or r rapidly captured o2 to produce superoxide o2 eqs 7 and 8 with forming alkyl peroxyl radicals roo as the intermediates in r transformation cases bettina and barbara 1996 balmer and sulzberger 1999 perissinotti et al 2001 pestovsky and bakac 2004 7 co2 o2 co2 o2 k 2 4 109 m 1s 1 8 r o2 roo rox o2 both o2 and the potential formed co2 were responsible for the reduction of fe iii to fe ii jeong and yoon 2004 pang et al 2019 9 fe3 l o2 fe2 l o2 10 fe3 l co2 fe2 l co2 the reduction rates of fe iii by o2 and co2 were dependent on the speciation of fe iii for instance k9 were 1 5 108 rush and bielski 1985 1 5 106 sedlak and hoigné 1993 and 8 102 m 1s 1 garg et al 2007 for feiii oh 2 fe oa and fe ca complexes respectively in control experiments with continuously bubbling n2 pds decomposition was inhibited in the oa and ca assisted fe ii pds systems comparing with the cases without bubbling n2 fig s1 this result further suggested that o2 participated in promoting pds decomposition by accelerating fe iii reduction eqs 7 9 in these polycarboxylate chelators assisted systems however it was reported that the activation of peroxygen oxidant by fe ii required the availability of at least one iron coordination site that was open or occupied by a readily dissociable ligand such as water molecule graf et al 1984 hence it seemed likely that excess oa would inhibit the accessibility of fe ii center for pds attachment which led to the decrease of pds decomposition table 1 3 1 1 2 pmso loss fig 1 a and b showed pmso loss in the oa and ca assisted fe ii pds systems in the control experiment without chelator it was observed that 29 μm pmso was rapidly degraded within the first 5 min and afterwards 5 μm pmso was gradually degraded at a slower rate similarly it was reported that the oxidation of several contaminants e g trichloroethylene wu et al 2014 atrazine bu et al 2016 and naproxen dulova et al 2017 by the fe ii pds system also showed two stage kinetics this finding was explained by the rapid reactive intermediate formation in fe ii activated pds process and the subsequent slow recovery from fe iii to fe ii by organic oxidation intermediates in previous literature wu et al 2014 bu et al 2016 dulova et al 2017 however it was found that pds was continuously decomposed within the investigated time in the fe ii pds system with and without pmso fig s2 one possible explanation for this result involved the reduction of fe iii by persulfate radical s2o8 an inorganic oxidation intermediate of pds see details in text s2 liu et al 2014 2015 zhu et al 2018a b with the addition of 50 μm oa and ca i e chelator 0 fe ii 0 0 5 1 pmso loss at 90 min δ pmso t obviously increased to 48 and 42 μm respectively but a higher chelator 0 fe ii 0 led to the decrease of δ pmso t fig 1a and b in spite of the high pds decomposition in these cases further pds utilization efficiency for the degradation of pmso η pds was quantitatively evaluated by the molar ratio of δ pmso t δ pds t which was decreased with increasing chelator 0 fe ii 0 in both cases of oa and ca table 1 this result was explained by the competition of polycarboxylate chelators with pmso for the formed reactive intermediate s 3 1 2 aminocarboxylate chelators nta and edta 3 1 2 1 pds decomposition the tetra and hexa dentates aminocarboxylate chelators i e nta and edta respectively were selected to investigate the fe ii aminocarboxylate 100 μm complexes activated pds 500 μm processes at the six chelator 0 fe ii 0 0 1 to 5 1 at ph 3 with 50 μm pmso as shown in table 1 with increasing nta 0 fe ii 0 from 0 1 to 5 1 δ pds t gradually decreased from 100 to 71 μm similar result was obtained in the edta fe ii pds system where δ pds t significantly decreased to 51 μm with increasing edta 0 fe ii 0 to 1 1 and even no pds was decomposed at higher edta 0 fe ii 0 likewise it was reported that s s ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds another hexa dentate aminocarboxylate chelator coordinated fe ii showed low ability of activating pds as edds 0 fe ii 0 was higher than 1 1 because the complete coordination of fe ii with excess edds formed a bulky hexacoordinated complex which hindered the attachment of fe ii center by pds han et al 2015 comparatively the small molecule size chelators like oa and ca with shorter carbon chain length have slighter effect on hindering the reaction of fe ii with pds this steric hindrance effect reasonably explained the finding of the higher pds decomposition in oa and ca assisted fe ii pds systems than in these two aminocarboxylate chelators assisted cases under similar chelator 0 fe ii 0 molar ratio table 1 similarly rachmilovich calis et al 2011 found that although both tri polyphosphate and adenosine 5 triphosphate atp chelators contained three phosphate groups tri polyphosphate increased the fenton reaction rate more obviously than atp did this is due to that atp has another several nitrogen atoms in its adenine group which in turn introduce higher steric hindrance 3 1 2 2 pmso loss as shown in fig 2 a and b the degradation of pmso in both systems also progressed through a fast stage followed by a slow stage within 90 min which could be ascribed to the fact of fast formation of reactive intermediate and slow regeneration from fe iii to fe ii as aforementioned the inhibition of pds decomposition and pmso loss observed in the control experiments with bubbling n2 further verified the involvement of carboxyl group oxidation intermediates induced fe iii reduction fig s1 moreover it was observed that δ pmso t also decreased with the increase of chelator 0 fe ii 0 in both cases of nta and edta fig 2a and b in line with the pds decomposition additionally the calculated η pds values decreased with increasing aminocarboxylate 0 fe ii 0 table 1 similar to the polycarboxylate cases suggesting that aminocarboxylates also competitively consumed the formed reactive intermediates 3 1 3 polyphosphates chelators ppp and tpp 3 1 3 1 pds decomposition the selected polyphosphates chelators ppp and tpp contained two and four dentates respectively scheme 1 their effect on the reactive intermediate formation in the fe ii pds system were evaluated under similar conditions to the cases of polycarboxylate and aminocarboxylate chelators it was found that both fe ii ppp and fe ii tpp complexes showed poor ability on activating pds less than 30 μm pds was decomposed at each case table 1 as a result pmso loss was at a low level less than 10 μm of pmso was degraded when 50 μm ppp or tpp was added chelator 0 fe ii 0 0 5 1 and pmso loss was even negligible at higher chelator 0 fe ii 0 fig 3 a and b these observations indicated that the strong steric hindrance by ppp and tpp impeded the interaction between pds and fe ii ppp fe ii tpp complexes 3 1 3 2 pmso loss notably the oxidation of pmso was fast completed within 5 min and no further pmso degradation was observed which was different from the continuous degradation of pmso in both polycarboxylate and aminocarboxylate chelator assisted cases moreover pds decomposition and pmso loss in the control experiments with bubbling n2 were indistinguishable from those obtained under aerobic condition in these polyphosphates assisted cases fig s1 these results were rationalized by the fact that polyphosphates were resistant to oxidation biaglow and kachur 1997 wang and brusseau 1998 rastogi et al 2009 kim et al 2015 which led to the absence of the chelator oxidation intermediates induced fe iii reduction such as eqs 5 10 3 1 4 comparison with the effect of chelator concentration on h2o2 decomposition and pmso loss in the chelator assisted fe ii h2o2 systems at ph 3 for comparison effect of chelator concentration chelator 0 fe ii 0 0 1 to 5 1 on the decomposition of h2o2 and oxidation of pmso 50 μm in the chelator assisted fe ii h2o2 100 500 μm systems were also investigated at ph 3 as shown in table s2 the decomposition of h2o2 at 90 min δ h2o2 t was decreased to different extent with the increase of chelator 0 fe ii 0 in all the tested chelator assisted processes and the inhibition effect on h2o2 decomposition by the chelators roughly followed the order ca oa nta edta tpp ppp this order was consistent with that obtained in the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems where fe ii ca complex was the most effective activator for pds and fe ii polyphosphates complexes exhibited the strongest inhibition effect on pds activation table 1 the oxidation of pmso was divided into the fast stage and the slow stage in the polycarboxylate and aminocarboxylate chelators assisted fe ii h2o2 systems while the pmso degradation was quickly completed within the first 5 min in the cases of polyphosphates chelators fig s3 similar to the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems moreover the inhibition effect of bubbling n2 on h2o2 decomposition and pmso loss was obtained in the polycarboxylates and aminocarboxylates assisted fe ii h2o2 systems but not observed in cases of polyphosphates fig s4 as mentioned above these results were attributed to the fe iii reduction induced by the oxidation intermediates of carboxyl group eqs 5 10 which was absent in the polyphosphates assisted systems further the adverse effect of increasing chelator 0 on η h2o2 values was observed in the polycarboxylate and aminocarboxylate chelators assisted fe ii h2o2 systems table s1 similar to the cases of pds 3 2 effect of chelator concentration on pmso2 formation in the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems at ph 3 3 2 1 pmso2 production the production of pmso2 in the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems was monitored it was obtained that in the control case without chelator the production of pmso2 rapidly increased to 28 μm within first 5 min eq 3 and then continuously increased to about 32 μm at 90 min along with the slow oxidation of pmso fig 1a with increasing chelator 0 fe ii 0 from 0 5 1 to 5 1 pmso2 production at 90 min δ pmso2 t was decreased to different extent in each tested chelator assisted fe ii pds systems figs 1 3 suggesting the decrease of available fe iv in the fe ii pds system with higher chelator 0 fe ii 0 comparatively no pmso2 was formed in any chelator assisted fe ii h2o2 system indicating that oh was responsible for the pmso degradation in all these cases at ph 3 3 2 2 pmso2 yield to quantify the relative contribution of fe iv and so4 on pmso loss in the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems the η pmso2 values were calculated in the chelator free fe ii pds system the calculated η pmso2 value was about 100 interestingly it was found that the increase of chelator 0 fe ii 0 resulted in the decrease of the calculated η pmso2 value in each tested chelator assisted fe ii pds system figs 1 3 indicating that both fe iv and so4 contributed to the transformation of pmso and the contribution of fe iv was inversely proportional to chelator 0 fe ii 0 it seemed likely that the coordination of fe ii with the tested chelator altered the nature of the reactive oxidant formed in fe ii pds system from fe iv eq 3 to so4 eq 11 this conversion might be related to the change of fe ii chemistry e g the fe iii fe ii redox potential steric hindrance and charge via forming fe ii chelator complexes see details in text s3 biaglow and kachur 1997 bataineh et al 2012 adusei gyamfi et al 2019 further studies are needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism 11 fe2 l s2o8 2 fe3 l so4 so4 2 3 3 effect of ph on pds decomposition and pmso loss in the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems 3 3 1 pds decomposition the effect of solution ph was studied over a wide range of 3 9 under typical conditions i e 50 100 μm chelator 0 fe ii 0 500 μm pds 0 and 50 μm pmso 0 the decomposition of pds at different ph in the six chelator assisted systems was shown in fig s5 with increasing ph from 3 to 9 δ pds t decreased from the maximum to 0 in the chelator assisted systems similar to the control case without chelator δ pds t in the tested systems was in the sequence ca oa nta chelator free system edta tpp ppp further speciation of fe species as a function of ph was calculated by visual minteq software except for polyphosphate chelators cases due to the lack of key parameters pka and stability constants in the software as shown in fig s6 the proportion of fe ii chelator complexes increased with increasing ph which was attributed to the fact that the deprotonation of carboxyl group increased the available binding sites of chelators see table s3 for their pka adusei gyamfi et al 2019 the coordination of iron with chelators increased its solubility at high ph however the steric hindrance of the formed complexes prevented fe ii from pds attachment 3 3 2 pmso loss similar to the effect of ph on pds decomposition the increase of ph showed a negative effect on the pmso loss in the fe ii pds system with and without chelators fig 4 a at each ph the oxidation of pmso was promoted by addition of polycarboxylate chelators while significantly inhibited with adding polyphosphates chelators although the pmso loss was slightly promoted by the addition of some chelators under high ph the efficiency was still too low for instance δ pmso t was less than 5 μm at ph 7 and even no pmso was observed at ph 9 in the ca assisted fe ii pds system which was the most effective system for pmso degradation fig 4a moreover the poor degradation of pmso by the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems was also obtained in the experiments using real waters at neutral ph δ pmso t 1 μm in each case figs s7a and b where neutral solution ph maintained constant during the reactions figs s7c and d interestingly it has been reported that the fe ii pds systems with and without chelator have a good performance on eliminating contaminants e g aniline han et al 2015 levofloxacin epold et al 2015 naproxen dulova et al 2017 and ibuprofen jin et al 2018 at initial near neutral ph in the literature this is likely in contrast to the effect of ph on pmso loss in the chelator assisted or chelator free fe ii pds system obtained in this work fig 4 however we note that these studies have always been conducted in un buffered solutions where the addition of acidic fe ii and pds stock solutions as well as the release of h during the activation of pds eq 3 would result in an unavoidable immediate decrease of solution ph from near neutral to acidic condition unfortunately most of these studies neglected the significant change of solution ph in other words the good performance of the fe ii pds systems with and without chelator under initial circumneutral conditions observed in the literature was attributed to the acidification of unbuffered solutions 3 3 3 comparison with the chelator assisted fe ii h2o2 systems for comparison the effect of solution ph on h2o2 decomposition and pmso transformation in the chelator assisted fe ii h2o2 systems was also investigated at a wide ph range of 3 9 it was found that the increase of ph led to the decrease of h2o2 decomposition fig s8 similar to the case of pds decomposition fig s5 in parallel pmso loss decreased with the increase of ph in the chelator assisted fe ii h2o2 systems fig 5 a under acidic conditions ph 5 δ pmso t was in the order of ca oa nta edta tpp ppp however tpp fe ii complexes led to the most effective degradation of pmso at ph 7 and 9 kim et al 2015 also reported that tpp assisted fe ii h2o2 system achieved the highest degradation efficiency on microcystin lr oxidation at ph 7 comparing to the cases of oa and edta further pmso loss was still negligible in the experiments with using real waters at near neutral ph fig s9 3 4 effect of ph on pmso2 formation in the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems in the tested chelator assisted fe ii pds systems it was found that although pmso2 production was negatively influenced by increasing ph from 3 to 9 the calculated η pmso2 value was almost independent on solution ph fig 4b and c this result indicated that solution ph had no effect on the nature of reactive intermediate formed in these chelator assisted fe ii pds systems as for the chelator assisted fe ii h2o2 systems no formation of pmso2 was detected with using 50 μm pmso to capture the reactive intermediate indicating that oh mainly contributed to the pmso loss at these cases further a higher concentration of pmso 1 mm was used to capture the reactive intermediate it was found that pmso2 production increased from 0 to the maximum with ph increasing from 3 to 5 and then decreased to less than 2 μm at ph 7 and almost 0 at ph 9 fig 5b in this case the yield of pmso2 was hard to be calculated because the pmso loss was too small compared to the quite high pmso 0 as we stated previously wang et al 2018 nevertheless it was found that the maximum production of pmso2 was obtained in the chelator free fe ii h2o2 system at ph 5 where the lowest δ pmso t was obtained fig 5 hence it was reasonable to believe that the formation of fe ii chelator complexes with each tested chelator altered the nature of the intermediate formed by the reaction of fe ii with h2o2 from fe iv to oh at near neutral ph 4 conclusions this study systemically investigated the production and nature of the reactive intermediate formed in the fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems in the presence of six representative chelators by examining the oxidant decomposition and pmso transformation which not only clarified the complex effect of chelators on reactive intermediate formation but also gave the first insight into the relative contribution of fe iv and so4 oh in these systems the main conclusions are as follows i the polycarboxylates especially ca were the most effective chelator for promoting intermediate reactive production in the fe ii pds system over a wide ph range ph 3 9 however the most effective chelator for the fe ii h2o2 system changed from ca at acidic ph to tpp under near neutral conditions ii the optimal chelator 0 fe ii 0 molar ratio for promoting the degradation efficiency of pmso was 0 5 1 for each tested chelator assisted fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 system iii although the pmso loss was slightly promoted by the addition of chelators at neutral and alkaline ph the degradation efficiency was still too low in the chelator assisted cases iv the tested chelators altered the nature of the reactive intermediate formed in the fe ii pds system from fe iv to so4 the yield of fe iv was negatively affected by increasing chelator 0 fe ii 0 but was independent on ph v the tested chelators led to the change of the reactive intermediate formed in fe ii h2o2 system from fe iv to oh under circumneutral

18572,iron chelators are often used to improve the performance of fe ii activated peroxides e g peroxydisulfate pds and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 for oxidative water treatment over a wide ph range due to the enhanced solubility of iron in the presence of chelators at high ph in this study we compared the effect of various chelators on the production and nature of the reactive intermediate formed in fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems by using methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso as a probe which could distinguish ferryl ion fe iv from free radicals oh and so4 due to their marked difference in product formation six representative chelators oxalate acid oa citric acid ca nitrilotriacetic acid nta ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta pyrophosphate ppp and tetrapolyphosphate tpp which covered the commonly used polycarboxylates aminocarboxylates and polyphosphates ligands were selected in chelator assisted fe ii pds systems the highest pmso transformation efficiency at ph 3 9 was obtained in cases with polycarboxylates due to their higher reactivity to pds activation lower steric hindrance and stronger ability in promoting fe ii fe iii cycle comparatively in chelator assisted fe ii h2o2 systems tpp addition achieved the best performance in pmso transformation at ph 5 moreover the yield of fe iv indicative product methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 decreased with increasing chelator fe ii molar ratio but was independent on ph in cases of pds indicating that chelator altered reactive intermediate nature from fe iv to so4 and fe iv yield was not sensitive to ph in cases of h2o2 chelator decreased pmso2 production while promoting pmso loss at near neutral ph suggesting that fe ii chelator complexes also tended to catalyze h2o2 to generate oh rather than fe iv graphical abstract image

intermediate formed in the fe ii pds system is ferryl ion species fe iv rather than long recognized sulfate radical so4 by using methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso as a probe wang et al 2018 2019 it was firstly identified that pmso could be transferred to its corresponding sulfones methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 by feivo2 eq 1 while so4 oxidized pmso to produce biphenyl compounds rather than pmso2 eq 2 similar to the case of oh wang et al 2018 1 2 contrary to literature expectation pmso2 product was formed when pmso was treated by the fe ii pds system at acidic and neutral ph and the yield of pmso2 i e η pmso2 the molar ratio of pmso2 produced to pmso lost was quantified to be 100 at acidic ph this result indicated that fe iv was the dominant reactive intermediate formed in the fe ii pds system under acidic conditions and fe iv also occurred at circumneutral ph eq 3 wang et al 2018 3 fe2 s2o8 2 h2o feⅳo2 2so4 2 2h k 2 0 101 m 1s 1 due to the precipitation of iron at neutral and alkaline ph

to solubilize iron keenan and sedlak 2008a rastogi et al 2009 han et al 2015 miller et al 2016 the commonly used iron chelators can be categorized into three types including the polycarboxylates e g oxalate acid oa citric acid ca aminocarboxylates e g nitrilotriacetic acid nta ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and phosphates ligands e g pyrophosphate ppp tetrapolyphosphate tpp according to their coordination sites i e carboxyl amino or phosphate group although some researchers have comparatively investigated the effect of several chelators on reactive intermediate production in the fe

2015 therefore a systematic re evaluation of the influence of chelator on reactive intermediate production in fe ii pds system with careful ph control is required moreover limited information is

peroxide h2o2 process in the presence and absence of chelators have been extensively investigated by invoking sulfoxides e g dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and pmso as a probe it was demonstrated that hydroxyl radical oh was the primary intermediate generated in the fe ii h2o2 system under acidic conditions eq 4a while the reactive intermediate shifted to fe iv at near neutral ph eq 4b bataineh et

neutral ph rush and koppenol 1986 while others identified oh as the primary intermediate miller et al 2016 or found a mixture of oh and fe iv under circumneutral condition yamazaki and piette 1991 a similar conflicting conclusion was also obtained in the fe ii h2o2 system assisted by other chelators such as oa park et al 1997 keenan and sedlak 2008a thomas et al 2016 chen et al 2018 nta keenan and sedlak 2008a dao and de laat 2011 and tpp wang et al 2015 kim et al 2015 2017 miller et al 2016 concluded that the limitations of the common methods for the identification of the reactive

explore the effect of six representative iron chelators oa ca nta edta ppp and tpp see scheme 1 for their binding sites on the production and nature of the reactive intermediate formed in the fe ii

intermediate production moreover the formation of fe iv indicative product pmso2 was monitored under various conditions in an attempt to explore the effect of chelator on altering the reactive oxidant

because they do not form complexes with iron the ph varied by less than 0 2 units during the reaction samples 950 μl were withdrawn at certain time intervals and immediately quenched by adding 50 μl dmso before analysis by high pressure liquid chromatography hplc for pmso and pmso2 all experiments were performed at 20 c in triplicates and the mean values with standard deviations were presented 2 2 2 experiments in real waters two real waters were used in this work including surface water and wastewater effluent from a municipal sewage plant these water samples were filtered through 1 μm filter the physicochemical properties of these real waters were listed in table s1 reactions were initiated by adding the prepared fe ii chelator complex solution chelator 0 fe ii 0 50 100 μm to the real water matrices following the similar procedure to that in synthetic solutions 2 3 analytical methods concentrations of pds were measured with a modified iodometric method liang et al 2008 concentrations of h2o2 were determined spectrophotometrically using an n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd peroxidase method bader et al 1998 pmso and pmso2 were analyzed by waters 1525 hplc with uv detection at 230 and 215 nm respectively chromatographic separations were performed on a waters symmetry c18 column 150 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm using a binary mixture of acetonitrile and water containing 0 1 acetic acid as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of chelator concentration on pds decomposition and pmso loss in the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems at ph 3 3 1 1 polycarboxylate chelators oa and ca 3 1 1 1 pds decomposition oxalate acid and citric acid contain two and three carboxyl dentates respectively and thus they will completely chelate fe ii to form a hexacoordinated complex at chelator fe ii molar ratio of 3 1 or 2 1 han et al 2015 accordingly the effect of chelator initial concentration chelator 0 on pds decomposition and pmso 50 μm transformation in the fe ii pds 100 500 μm system was studied at six chelator fe ii molar ratios of 0 1 0 5 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 and 5 1 at ph 3 in the oa assisted fe ii pds system within the investigated time 90 min pds decomposition i e δ pds t increased from about 100 to 182 μm with increasing oa 0 fe ii 0 from 0 1 to 2 1 and then dramatically decreased to 108 μm with oa 0 fe ii 0 further increasing to 5 1 table 1 as for the ca assisted fe ii pds system δ pds t was significantly promoted from 100 to 320 μm with increasing ca 0 fe ii 0 from 0 1 to 5 1 and it was much higher than that in the oa assisted cases at each chelator 0 fe ii 0 molar ratios table 1 similar to the study of han et al 2015 the acceleration of pds decomposition by addition of appropriate oa and ca could be attributed to the following reasons i oa fe ii and ca fe ii complexes show higher reactivity than aqueous fe ii toward pds activation similar to the oa and ca assisted fe ii h2o2 systems for example the reaction rate of feii c2o4 with h2o2 3 104 m 1s 1 is almost 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of aqueous fe ii with h2o2 7 6 101 m 1s 1 balmer and sulzberger 1999 and ii the oa and ca oxidation intermediates facilitated the reduction of fe iii to fe ii through the following radical chain reactions eqs 5 10 which further promoted pds decomposition specifically polycarboxylate chelators r cooh were oxidized by the reactive intermediate s fe iv and or so4 eqs 5 and 6 to produce carboxyl anion radicals co2 or alkyl radicals r depending on the attack sites of carboxylates by reactive intermediate s oxidation see details in text s1 jacobsen et al 1998 pestovsky and bakac 2004 criquet and leitner 2009 thomas et al 2016 chen et al 2018 pang et al 2019 5 feivo2 r cooh fe3 co2 r intermediates 6 so4 r cooh so4 2 co2 r intermediates subsequently co2 and or r rapidly captured o2 to produce superoxide o2 eqs 7 and 8 with forming alkyl peroxyl radicals roo as the intermediates in r transformation cases bettina and barbara 1996 balmer and sulzberger 1999 perissinotti et al 2001 pestovsky and bakac 2004 7 co2 o2 co2 o2 k 2 4 109 m 1s 1 8 r o2 roo rox o2 both o2 and the potential formed co2 were responsible for the reduction of fe iii to fe ii jeong and yoon 2004 pang et al 2019 9 fe3 l o2 fe2 l o2 10 fe3 l co2 fe2 l co2 the reduction rates of fe iii by o2 and co2 were dependent on the speciation of fe iii for instance k9 were 1 5 108 rush and bielski 1985 1 5 106 sedlak and hoigné 1993 and 8 102 m 1s 1 garg et al 2007 for feiii oh 2 fe oa and fe ca complexes respectively in control experiments with continuously bubbling n2 pds decomposition was inhibited in the oa and ca assisted fe ii pds systems comparing with the cases without bubbling n2 fig s1 this result further suggested that o2 participated in promoting pds decomposition by accelerating fe iii reduction eqs 7 9 in these polycarboxylate chelators assisted systems however it was reported that the activation of peroxygen oxidant by fe ii required the availability of at least one iron coordination site that was open or occupied by a readily dissociable ligand such as water molecule graf et al 1984 hence it seemed likely that excess oa would inhibit the accessibility of fe ii center for pds attachment which led to the decrease of pds decomposition table 1 3 1 1 2 pmso loss fig 1 a and b showed pmso loss in the oa and ca assisted fe ii pds systems in the control experiment without chelator it was observed that 29 μm pmso was rapidly degraded within the first 5 min and afterwards 5 μm pmso was gradually degraded at a slower rate similarly it was reported that the oxidation of several contaminants e g trichloroethylene wu et al 2014 atrazine bu et al 2016 and naproxen dulova et al 2017 by the fe ii pds system also showed two stage kinetics this finding was explained by the rapid reactive intermediate formation in fe ii activated pds process and the subsequent slow recovery from fe iii to fe ii by organic oxidation intermediates in previous literature wu et al 2014 bu et al 2016 dulova et al 2017 however it was found that pds was continuously decomposed within the investigated time in the fe ii pds system with and without pmso fig s2 one possible explanation for this result involved the reduction of fe iii by persulfate radical s2o8 an inorganic oxidation intermediate of pds see details in text s2 liu et al 2014 2015 zhu et al 2018a b with the addition of 50 μm oa and ca i e chelator 0 fe ii 0 0 5 1 pmso loss at 90 min δ pmso t obviously increased to 48 and 42 μm respectively but a higher chelator 0 fe ii 0 led to the decrease of δ pmso t fig 1a and b in spite of the high pds decomposition in these cases further pds utilization efficiency for the degradation of pmso η pds was quantitatively evaluated by the molar ratio of δ pmso t δ pds t which was decreased with increasing chelator 0 fe ii 0 in both cases of oa and ca table 1 this result was explained by the competition of polycarboxylate chelators with pmso for the formed reactive intermediate s 3 1 2 aminocarboxylate chelators nta and edta 3 1 2 1 pds decomposition the tetra and hexa dentates aminocarboxylate chelators i e nta and edta respectively were selected to investigate the fe ii aminocarboxylate 100 μm complexes activated pds 500 μm processes at the six chelator 0 fe ii 0 0 1 to 5 1 at ph 3 with 50 μm pmso as shown in table 1 with increasing nta 0 fe ii 0 from 0 1 to 5 1 δ pds t gradually decreased from 100 to 71 μm similar result was obtained in the edta fe ii pds system where δ pds t significantly decreased to 51 μm with increasing edta 0 fe ii 0 to 1 1 and even no pds was decomposed at higher edta 0 fe ii 0 likewise it was reported that s s ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds another hexa dentate aminocarboxylate chelator coordinated fe ii showed low ability of activating pds as edds 0 fe ii 0 was higher than 1 1 because the complete coordination of fe ii with excess edds formed a bulky hexacoordinated complex which hindered the attachment of fe ii center by pds han et al 2015 comparatively the small molecule size chelators like oa and ca with shorter carbon chain length have slighter effect on hindering the reaction of fe ii with pds this steric hindrance effect reasonably explained the finding of the higher pds decomposition in oa and ca assisted fe ii pds systems than in these two aminocarboxylate chelators assisted cases under similar chelator 0 fe ii 0 molar ratio table 1 similarly rachmilovich calis et al 2011 found that although both tri polyphosphate and adenosine 5 triphosphate atp chelators contained three phosphate groups tri polyphosphate increased the fenton reaction rate more obviously than atp did this is due to that atp has another several nitrogen atoms in its adenine group which in turn introduce higher steric hindrance 3 1 2 2 pmso loss as shown in fig 2 a and b the degradation of pmso in both systems also progressed through a fast stage followed by a slow stage within 90 min which could be ascribed to the fact of fast formation of reactive intermediate and slow regeneration from fe iii to fe ii as aforementioned the inhibition of pds decomposition and pmso loss observed in the control experiments with bubbling n2 further verified the involvement of carboxyl group oxidation intermediates induced fe iii reduction fig s1 moreover it was observed that δ pmso t also decreased with the increase of chelator 0 fe ii 0 in both cases of nta and edta fig 2a and b in line with the pds decomposition additionally the calculated η pds values decreased with increasing aminocarboxylate 0 fe ii 0 table 1 similar to the polycarboxylate cases suggesting that aminocarboxylates also competitively consumed the formed reactive intermediates 3 1 3 polyphosphates chelators ppp and tpp 3 1 3 1 pds decomposition the selected polyphosphates chelators ppp and tpp contained two and four dentates respectively scheme 1 their effect on the reactive intermediate formation in the fe ii pds system were evaluated under similar conditions to the cases of polycarboxylate and aminocarboxylate chelators it was found that both fe ii ppp and fe ii tpp complexes showed poor ability on activating pds less than 30 μm pds was decomposed at each case table 1 as a result pmso loss was at a low level less than 10 μm of pmso was degraded when 50 μm ppp or tpp was added chelator 0 fe ii 0 0 5 1 and pmso loss was even negligible at higher chelator 0 fe ii 0 fig 3 a and b these observations indicated that the strong steric hindrance by ppp and tpp impeded the interaction between pds and fe ii ppp fe ii tpp complexes 3 1 3 2 pmso loss notably the oxidation of pmso was fast completed within 5 min and no further pmso degradation was observed which was different from the continuous degradation of pmso in both polycarboxylate and aminocarboxylate chelator assisted cases moreover pds decomposition and pmso loss in the control experiments with bubbling n2 were indistinguishable from those obtained under aerobic condition in these polyphosphates assisted cases fig s1 these results were rationalized by the fact that polyphosphates were resistant to oxidation biaglow and kachur 1997 wang and brusseau 1998 rastogi et al 2009 kim et al 2015 which led to the absence of the chelator oxidation intermediates induced fe iii reduction such as eqs 5 10 3 1 4 comparison with the effect of chelator concentration on h2o2 decomposition and pmso loss in the chelator assisted fe ii h2o2 systems at ph 3 for comparison effect of chelator concentration chelator 0 fe ii 0 0 1 to 5 1 on the decomposition of h2o2 and oxidation of pmso 50 μm in the chelator assisted fe ii h2o2 100 500 μm systems were also investigated at ph 3 as shown in table s2 the decomposition of h2o2 at 90 min δ h2o2 t was decreased to different extent with the increase of chelator 0 fe ii 0 in all the tested chelator assisted processes and the inhibition effect on h2o2 decomposition by the chelators roughly followed the order ca oa nta edta tpp ppp this order was consistent with that obtained in the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems where fe ii ca complex was the most effective activator for pds and fe ii polyphosphates complexes exhibited the strongest inhibition effect on pds activation table 1 the oxidation of pmso was divided into the fast stage and the slow stage in the polycarboxylate and aminocarboxylate chelators assisted fe ii h2o2 systems while the pmso degradation was quickly completed within the first 5 min in the cases of polyphosphates chelators fig s3 similar to the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems moreover the inhibition effect of bubbling n2 on h2o2 decomposition and pmso loss was obtained in the polycarboxylates and aminocarboxylates assisted fe ii h2o2 systems but not observed in cases of polyphosphates fig s4 as mentioned above these results were attributed to the fe iii reduction induced by the oxidation intermediates of carboxyl group eqs 5 10 which was absent in the polyphosphates assisted systems further the adverse effect of increasing chelator 0 on η h2o2 values was observed in the polycarboxylate and aminocarboxylate chelators assisted fe ii h2o2 systems table s1 similar to the cases of pds 3 2 effect of chelator concentration on pmso2 formation in the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems at ph 3 3 2 1 pmso2 production the production of pmso2 in the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems was monitored it was obtained that in the control case without chelator the production of pmso2 rapidly increased to 28 μm within first 5 min eq 3 and then continuously increased to about 32 μm at 90 min along with the slow oxidation of pmso fig 1a with increasing chelator 0 fe ii 0 from 0 5 1 to 5 1 pmso2 production at 90 min δ pmso2 t was decreased to different extent in each tested chelator assisted fe ii pds systems figs 1 3 suggesting the decrease of available fe iv in the fe ii pds system with higher chelator 0 fe ii 0 comparatively no pmso2 was formed in any chelator assisted fe ii h2o2 system indicating that oh was responsible for the pmso degradation in all these cases at ph 3 3 2 2 pmso2 yield to quantify the relative contribution of fe iv and so4 on pmso loss in the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems the η pmso2 values were calculated in the chelator free fe ii pds system the calculated η pmso2 value was about 100 interestingly it was found that the increase of chelator 0 fe ii 0 resulted in the decrease of the calculated η pmso2 value in each tested chelator assisted fe ii pds system figs 1 3 indicating that both fe iv and so4 contributed to the transformation of pmso and the contribution of fe iv was inversely proportional to chelator 0 fe ii 0 it seemed likely that the coordination of fe ii with the tested chelator altered the nature of the reactive oxidant formed in fe ii pds system from fe iv eq 3 to so4 eq 11 this conversion might be related to the change of fe ii chemistry e g the fe iii fe ii redox potential steric hindrance and charge via forming fe ii chelator complexes see details in text s3 biaglow and kachur 1997 bataineh et al 2012 adusei gyamfi et al 2019 further studies are needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism 11 fe2 l s2o8 2 fe3 l so4 so4 2 3 3 effect of ph on pds decomposition and pmso loss in the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems 3 3 1 pds decomposition the effect of solution ph was studied over a wide range of 3 9 under typical conditions i e 50 100 μm chelator 0 fe ii 0 500 μm pds 0 and 50 μm pmso 0 the decomposition of pds at different ph in the six chelator assisted systems was shown in fig s5 with increasing ph from 3 to 9 δ pds t decreased from the maximum to 0 in the chelator assisted systems similar to the control case without chelator δ pds t in the tested systems was in the sequence ca oa nta chelator free system edta tpp ppp further speciation of fe species as a function of ph was calculated by visual minteq software except for polyphosphate chelators cases due to the lack of key parameters pka and stability constants in the software as shown in fig s6 the proportion of fe ii chelator complexes increased with increasing ph which was attributed to the fact that the deprotonation of carboxyl group increased the available binding sites of chelators see table s3 for their pka adusei gyamfi et al 2019 the coordination of iron with chelators increased its solubility at high ph however the steric hindrance of the formed complexes prevented fe ii from pds attachment 3 3 2 pmso loss similar to the effect of ph on pds decomposition the increase of ph showed a negative effect on the pmso loss in the fe ii pds system with and without chelators fig 4 a at each ph the oxidation of pmso was promoted by addition of polycarboxylate chelators while significantly inhibited with adding polyphosphates chelators although the pmso loss was slightly promoted by the addition of some chelators under high ph the efficiency was still too low for instance δ pmso t was less than 5 μm at ph 7 and even no pmso was observed at ph 9 in the ca assisted fe ii pds system which was the most effective system for pmso degradation fig 4a moreover the poor degradation of pmso by the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems was also obtained in the experiments using real waters at neutral ph δ pmso t 1 μm in each case figs s7a and b where neutral solution ph maintained constant during the reactions figs s7c and d interestingly it has been reported that the fe ii pds systems with and without chelator have a good performance on eliminating contaminants e g aniline han et al 2015 levofloxacin epold et al 2015 naproxen dulova et al 2017 and ibuprofen jin et al 2018 at initial near neutral ph in the literature this is likely in contrast to the effect of ph on pmso loss in the chelator assisted or chelator free fe ii pds system obtained in this work fig 4 however we note that these studies have always been conducted in un buffered solutions where the addition of acidic fe ii and pds stock solutions as well as the release of h during the activation of pds eq 3 would result in an unavoidable immediate decrease of solution ph from near neutral to acidic condition unfortunately most of these studies neglected the significant change of solution ph in other words the good performance of the fe ii pds systems with and without chelator under initial circumneutral conditions observed in the literature was attributed to the acidification of unbuffered solutions 3 3 3 comparison with the chelator assisted fe ii h2o2 systems for comparison the effect of solution ph on h2o2 decomposition and pmso transformation in the chelator assisted fe ii h2o2 systems was also investigated at a wide ph range of 3 9 it was found that the increase of ph led to the decrease of h2o2 decomposition fig s8 similar to the case of pds decomposition fig s5 in parallel pmso loss decreased with the increase of ph in the chelator assisted fe ii h2o2 systems fig 5 a under acidic conditions ph 5 δ pmso t was in the order of ca oa nta edta tpp ppp however tpp fe ii complexes led to the most effective degradation of pmso at ph 7 and 9 kim et al 2015 also reported that tpp assisted fe ii h2o2 system achieved the highest degradation efficiency on microcystin lr oxidation at ph 7 comparing to the cases of oa and edta further pmso loss was still negligible in the experiments with using real waters at near neutral ph fig s9 3 4 effect of ph on pmso2 formation in the chelator assisted fe ii pds systems in the tested chelator assisted fe ii pds systems it was found that although pmso2 production was negatively influenced by increasing ph from 3 to 9 the calculated η pmso2 value was almost independent on solution ph fig 4b and c this result indicated that solution ph had no effect on the nature of reactive intermediate formed in these chelator assisted fe ii pds systems as for the chelator assisted fe ii h2o2 systems no formation of pmso2 was detected with using 50 μm pmso to capture the reactive intermediate indicating that oh mainly contributed to the pmso loss at these cases further a higher concentration of pmso 1 mm was used to capture the reactive intermediate it was found that pmso2 production increased from 0 to the maximum with ph increasing from 3 to 5 and then decreased to less than 2 μm at ph 7 and almost 0 at ph 9 fig 5b in this case the yield of pmso2 was hard to be calculated because the pmso loss was too small compared to the quite high pmso 0 as we stated previously wang et al 2018 nevertheless it was found that the maximum production of pmso2 was obtained in the chelator free fe ii h2o2 system at ph 5 where the lowest δ pmso t was obtained fig 5 hence it was reasonable to believe that the formation of fe ii chelator complexes with each tested chelator altered the nature of the intermediate formed by the reaction of fe ii with h2o2 from fe iv to oh at near neutral ph 4 conclusions this study systemically investigated the production and nature of the reactive intermediate formed in the fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems in the presence of six representative chelators by examining the oxidant decomposition and pmso transformation which not only clarified the complex effect of chelators on reactive intermediate formation but also gave the first insight into the relative contribution of fe iv and so4 oh in these systems the main conclusions are as follows i the polycarboxylates especially ca were the most effective chelator for promoting intermediate reactive production in the fe ii pds system over a wide ph range ph 3 9 however the most effective chelator for the fe ii h2o2 system changed from ca at acidic ph to tpp under near neutral conditions ii the optimal chelator 0 fe ii 0 molar ratio for promoting the degradation efficiency of pmso was 0 5 1 for each tested chelator assisted fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 system iii although the pmso loss was slightly promoted by the addition of chelators at neutral and alkaline ph the degradation efficiency was still too low in the chelator assisted cases iv the tested chelators altered the nature of the reactive intermediate formed in the fe ii pds system from fe iv to so4 the yield of fe iv was negatively affected by increasing chelator 0 fe ii 0 but was independent on ph v the tested chelators led to the change of the reactive intermediate formed in fe ii h2o2 system from fe iv to oh under circumneutral

of dom characteristics in sludge alkaline fermentation is limited this study focused on the functional groups fluorescent components and molecular features of dom as well as molecular weight of

kda proteins 381 5 38 4 mg l was observed at ph 10 p 0 05 further analysis of dom molecular characteristics indicated that ph 10 resulted in the highest molecular diversity and the generation or degradation of easily biodegradable lipid like and proteins amino sugars like formulas the improved solubilization of dom contributed to vfas production meanwhile increasing ph to 10 also promoted the

because of its high organic matter content anaerobic digestion ad is widely used for ss treatment and can produce volatile fatty acids vfas or methane appels et al 2008 chen et al 2007 vfas can act as superior carbon sources for biological nutrient removal bnr process ad of ss for vfas generation is an attractive strategy for producing carbon sources for bnr process li et al 2011 yu et al 2008 prior to vfas production hydrolysis of insoluble organic matter to dissolved organic matter dom and acidification of the generated dom to vfas are necessary steps chen et al 2017 ma et al 2019 the rate limiting step is hydrolysis therefore enhancing the hydrolysis and acidification of ss is of great interest alkaline fermentation especially ph 10 can greatly improve the hydrolysis and acidification of ss resulting in a substantially enhanced vfas production liu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 many studies have been performed to investigate the mechanism of improved hydrolysis and acidification by ss alkaline fermentation saf especially at ph 10 chen et al 2017 li et al 2011 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2009 zheng et al 2013 generally these studies point out that saf can break extracellular polymeric substances eps matrix and increase dom concentration as well as inhibit methanogens especially increase protein pn concentration chen et al 2017 maspolim et al 2015 which significantly favors vfas production the increase of dom is one of the most important reasons for vfas production chen et al 2007 wang et al 2019 in hydrolysis stage complex dom is produced chen et al 2017 and dom is the direct substrate for vfas generation yekta et al 2012 not only the dom concentration but also the characteristics of dom significantly influence its transformation to vfas chen et al 2017 kamjunke et al 2017 moreover information about the features of refractory dom produced during saf should be given because the refractory dom may adversely affect the effluent quality of bnr process or following treatment azman et al 2017 cao et al 2019a 2019b maizel and remucal 2017 however our understanding of dom characteristics in saf is still limited chen et al 2017 characterized the dom in saf with stepwise ph increase and found that increasing ph led to an increase of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic doc such as building blocks high molecular weight mw and low mw protein recently cao et al 2019b reported that building blocks were the dominant refractory dom in effluent of sludge alkaline fermentation liquid driven denitrification the complex and diverse saf driven dom requires a multi method analytical characterization detailed information on dom characteristics and dom transformation is essential to obtaining a better understanding on the mechanism of improved hydrolysis acidification by saf and helps identify potential implications when applying the fermentation liquid to the bnr process fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms can provide precise molecular formulas in the complex dom matrices the fticr ms gives novel insight and greater recognition of the molecular characteristics of complex dom osborne et al 2013 valle et al 2018 proteins pn are the principal part of dom and intensive pn degradation is the leading cause of enhanced vfas production in saf wu et al 2010 zheng et al 2013 macromolecular pn can be hydrolyzed into micromolecular pn at alkaline conditions then the anaerobes can directly take up organic matter that is smaller than 1 kda for vfas production chen et al 2017 found that saf with a stepwise ph increase enhanced the solubilization of both low and high mw protein unfortunately the study did not determine the content of mw 1 kda protein recently cao et al 2019b reported that high mw pn were potential refractory dom moreover types of soluble proteins can also be influenced by different ph values xiao et al 2017 those characteristics of pn would largely affect its application as feed stuff nevertheless little is known about the characteristics of soluble pn in saf with different ph values the dom can result from both eps and intracellular organics in ss the transformation of organics from pellet to tightly bound eps tb eps and loosely bound eps lb eps as well as soluble eps sb eps represent the release characteristics of ss li et al 2014b it is well known that eps is the dominant component of organics in ss yu et al 2008 found that the transfer of pn from tb eps to sb eps is accompanied by the degradation of pn however previous studies mainly used batch experiments or characterized the eps in terms of pn and ps content jin et al 2016 the chemical characteristics of eps are known to affect its solubilization and biodegradability therefore investigations on eps features are helpful for understanding the improved hydrolysis and acidification by saf this study investigated the characteristics of dom in sludge alkaline fermentation with different ph values for vfas production the functional groups fluorescent components and molecular characteristics of dom and molecular weight distribution of pn were analyzed the changes in eps characteristics were also studied the results would deepen our understanding of enhanced sludge hydrolysis and acidification by alkaline fermentation in addition the potential refractory dom characteristics were also identified and thus provide essential information for further treatment together this paper helps to get a better insight into alkaline fermentation of ss for vfas production 2 materials and methods 2

days after operating the reactors for 6 srt samples 3 were collected and analyzed among them triplicate samples were used for analysis of the soluble pn molecular weight distribution all the samples were centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min then were collected and filtrated through 0 45 μm fiber filter all the samples were collected before adding raw ss 2 3 analysis of dom characteristics freeze

furthermore 25 dom samples were used for the parallel factor analysis parafac detailed information about eem measurement and parafac are presented in the supporting information for the analysis of dom molecular characteristics the filtrated 0 45 μm liquid sample was adjusted to ph 2 then solid phase extraction spe cartridges 1 g 6 ml functionalized styrene divinyl benzene polymer resin supelco were used to extract the dom the extracted dom was detected by a 9 4 t fticr ms bruker daltonics bremen germany methods for fticr ms measurement can be found in our previous studies hu et al 2018 all formulas were determined using bruker dataanalysis software version 4 1 and matlab routines kujawinski and behn 2006 other chemical constraints were described in the supporting information the mw distribution of pn was classified as follows 1 1 10 10 30 and 30 kda filters millipore corp usa with mw cutoffs of 1 10 and 30 kda were used to conduct the mw fractions with a 400 ml amicon model 8400 stirred cell unit milliporesigma corp burlington ma usa 2 4 eps extraction eps were extracted according to the method described in sun et al 2018 briefly 50 ml of digestate was collected and centrifuged 4000 g 15 min and the bulk solution was collected as the sb eps these supernatant were further used to analyze the characteristics of dom the solids were resuspended to 50 ml using a 0 05

visualization 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the fermentation reactors the scod generated at ph 8 2423 54 83 mg l 9 4533 66 24 mg l and 10 6448 72 37 mg l were significantly higher than that at ph 7 and uncontrolled reactors 1403 33 87 and 1315 40 94 mg l p 0 05 t test the total vfas production also increased from 722 3 34 21 to 3762 204 68 mg cod l as ph increased from uncontrolled and 7 to 10 fig 1 c the results are consistent with yu et al 2008 and chen et al 2007 implying that increasing ph to 10 can highly improve the hydrolysis and acidification efficiency of ss as shown in fig s1 increasing ph also inhibited the ch4 production at ph 10 no ch4 was produced and h2 yield was 15 34 ml g vs the improved hydrolysis and acidification and the inhibited methanogenesis zheng et al 2013 at alkaline ph accounted for the increase of scod and tvfas the soluble pn concentration at ph 8 9 and 10 387 5 1338 8 mg cod l were significantly higher than that at ph of uncontrolled and 7 265 7 284 8 mg cod l p 0 05 t test zhang et al 2009 also found that by increasing the fermentation ph from 7 to 10 soluble pn increased from 41 to 163 mg cod g vs it means that alkaline treatment can efficiently promote the solubilization of pn in ss xiao et al 2017 soluble ps increased slightly with the increase of ph and its content was lower than the content of pn in all the reactors it is agreed with previous studies that pn is the dominant fraction of dom chen et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 unknown scod also increased from 152 3 to 185 6 mg l to 304 1 975 4 mg l as the ph increased from uncontrolled and 7 to 8 9 and 10 unknown scod may be composed of humic acid and fulvic acid substance as well as dna ma et al 2019 the characteristics of dom can largely affect its transformation to vfas and degradation in following steps which was an incentive for further analysis of dom features in this study 3 2 characteristics of dom in alkaline fermentation reactors 3 2 1 ftir spectra of dom ftir spectra in the region of 1800 900 cm 1 is believed to offer primary information about functional groups of dom or eps wang et al 2018 zhu et al 2012 the ftir results fig 2 a contain five regions correlated with different functional groups amide i proteins 1700 1600 cm 1 amide ii proteins 1600 1500 cm 1 carboxylic group containing and hydrocarbon like compounds 1500 1300 cm 1 amide iii proteins 1300 1200 cm 1 and polysaccharides and nucleic acids 1200 900 cm 1 wang et al 2018 badireddy et al 2010 as is shown in fig 2a diverse bands appeared revealing the complex functional groups of dom the functional groups of the five dom samples were similar a closer observation found that a band at 1569 cm 1 was only detected at ph 10 implying that the content of co nh at ph 10 was relatively higher than at other ph values wang et al 2018 a weak band at 1157 cm 1 was only detected at ph uncontrolled and 7 which means the dom contained a relatively higher amount of polysaccharide than that at ph 8 9 and 10 these results agree with previous studies wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2013 implying that saf can efficiently enhance the hydrolysis of proteins 3 2 2 dom fluorescent components eem parafac modeling of the 25 samples generated a six components model fig s2 and table 1 the identified components consisted of four protein like components tryptophan like c1 c2 and c3 tyrosine like c4 one fulvic like component c5 and one humic like component c6 ishii and boyer 2012 li et al 2014a the fluorescence intensity of the components increased with the increase of ph fig 2b especially the protein like components p 0 05 this finding agrees with the ftir results illustrating that increasing fermentation ph to 10 can efficiently enhance the hydrolysis of proteins previous studies also observed that protein like fulvic like and humic like substances in liquid increased with the increase of ph in alkaline pretreatment of ss li et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 the fluorescence intensity of protein like substances was higher than that of fulvic like and humic like substances in all the reactors protein like substances c1 c2 c3 and c4 are the major and easily biodegradable substrate especially compared to humic like substances for vfas production li et al 2014a reported that tryptophan like materials degraded gradually while tyrosine like materials fluctuated over time during a 43 days s ad of dewatered ss the accumulation of these dom at alkaline ph might be due to the combined effect of low srt 8 d the highly enhanced release of protein the possibly inhibited acidogenesis chen et al 2017 and their biodegradable mechanisms li et al 2014a while fulvic like and humic like substances are hard biodegradable materials cao et al 2019a zhang et al 2016 li et al 2019 found that humic acids can promote acidification of ss polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon can enhance acetic acid production in ss fermentation luo et al 2016 increasing fermentation ph has been shown to increase the hydrolysis of protein like fulvic like and humic like substances which further favors vfas production especially at ph 10 however the highest vfas and scod production and fulvic like and humic like substances were simultaneous at a fermentation ph 10 cao et al 2019b found that fulvic like and humic like substances in fermentation liquid were difficult to be degraded in sequencing batch reactor driven denitrification process moreover an extended hrt also had a minor effect on the removal efficiency the presence of this type of dom may inhibit the n removal efficiency and deteriorate the effluent fernandes et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 therefore further studies are required to determine more efficient removal of fulvic like and humic like substances in saf liquid ph 10 especially when considering the reuse of treated wastewater in wwtps michael kordatou et al 2015 ni et al 2011 3 2 3 molecular characteristics van krevelen diagrams fig s3 according to the molar ratio of h c and o c were used to analyze the entire formulas detected in the dom samples kamjunke et al 2017 dom formulas were mainly located in the region of h c of 0 7 2 2 and the o c of 0 1 0 8 which agree with previous studies ma et al 2019 yekta et al 2012 the amount of assigned formulas of the reactors with ph uncontrolled 7 8 9 and 10 were 4493 4682 5338 5545 and 5668 respectively the increased diversity of assigned formulas illustrated that the hydrolysis of organic matter was enhanced by increasing the fermentative ph to further distinguish the dom characteristics the differential molecular formulas between ph uncontrolled and ph 7 8 9 and 10 were analyzed fig 3 with the increase of ph more and more differential molecular formulas appeared lipid like and h c 1 8 of proteins amino sugars like molecules decreased at ph 8 9 and 10 compared with ph uncontrolled these compounds form the major and easily degradable substrates to fermentative bacteria for vfas production combined with the increased vfas production fig 1b and the decreased eps content fig 5 a reasonable inference is that the hydrolysis and degradation of these compounds was highly enhanced at ph of 8 9 and 10 h c 1 7 of proteins amino sugars like dom are potential aromatic compounds hu et al 2018 and increased with the increase of ph which is consistent with the observations by eem increasing dom molecules were found in the carbohydrate like region with the increase of ph and its diversity was lower than proteins amino sugars increasing lignin like and tannins like substances were also found with the increase of ph lignin like substances and tannins like substances are potential aromatic and hard biodegradable material ma et al 2019 hertkorn et al 2006 the degradation of carboxylic and alicyclic organic compounds can lead to an increase of lignin like substances hertkorn et al 2006 moreover lignocellulosic matter is one of the components of ss hao et al 2017 the numerous lignin like molecules in high ph reactors especially ph 10 were most likely attributed to the high degradation of proteins and or the low degradation of the hydrolytic lignocellulosic matter therefore it is suggested that both higher molecular diversity and greater generation or degradation of easily degradable substrates accounted for the improved vfas production in saf meanwhile hard biodegradable molecules were also greatly generated especially ph 10 n containing compounds are related to the transformation of proteins in ss xiao et al 2017 the number of n containing molecules was 2558 uncontrolled 2484 7 2703 8 2789 9 and 2894 10 which indicated that hydrolysis or transformation of those compounds were enhanced by increasing ph lu et al 2018 also found that alkaline pretreatment led to a large amount of n compounds the large numbers of n containing molecules in the reactors may be because proteins are the major component of ss and the key substrate for bacteria or alkalinity among the n containing molecules 2303 ph 10 2181 ph 9 2072 ph 8 1924 ph 7 and 1825 ph uncontrolled molecules were located in lignin like and tannins like regions xiao et al 2017 reported that the dominant n species was pyridine n in sludge after alkaline pretreatment and cyclization of amine n intermediates may generate heterocyclic n compounds the high diversity of hard biodegradable n containing molecules at ph 10 may increase the diversity of soluble n containing organic matter in effluent of bnr eom et al 2017 which would be adverse to the effluent quality of bnr process 3 2 4 molecular weight distribution of soluble proteins the mw distribution of soluble pn in the reactors with different ph is shown in fig 4 mw 30 kda pn was more dominant than mw 30 kda pn in all reactors xiao et al 2017 also found that after a 30 min pretreatment of ss at ph of 6 3 10 mw 20 kda pn was the dominant pn mw 1 kda pn increased from 53 26 7 98 to 381 5 38 4 mg l as the ph increased p 0 05 implying that the microbes in reactors with higher ph possessed more pn that can be directly degraded this phenomenon also accounted for the enhanced vfas production at saf chen et al 2017 also found that low mw pn was accumulated with increased ph levels and the profiles of those dom might be a reason for this phenomenon besides the mentioned reasons in section 3 2 2 the mainly accumulated proteins amino sugars like dom at high ph levels is tend to have low h c 1 7 and high unsaturated degree table 2 which also likely limits their quick degradation under restrained retention time hu et al 2018 yekta et al 2012 the percentage of mw 1 kda pn at ph of uncontrolled 7 8 9 and 10 was 30 06 33 35 44 55 52 60 and 42 74 respectively this phenomenon illustrates that increasing ph promotes the transformation of pn from high mw to low mw the decreased percentage of mw 1 kda pn at ph 10 may result from the efficient degradation of those pn previous studies have reported that pn degrading microbes were significantly accumulated in ss fermentation at ph 10 huang et al 2016 zheng et al 2013 alkaline fermentation of ss not only enhanced the hydrolysis of pn but also enhanced the transformation of pn from high mw to low mw which further favored the vfas production mw 30 kda pn also showed a significant increase at ph 10 176 4 18 0 mg l high mw pn can account for 13 37 17 39 of the refractory dom in effluent of bnr process using sludge alkaline fermentation liquid as its carbon source cao et al 2019b enhanced transformation of high mw pn to vfas in the reactor at ph 10 would be meaningful because of those pn are also good substrate for fermentative bacteria but may be adverse to bnr process effluent quality 3 3 eps characteristics in alkaline fermentation reactors 3 3 1 eps distribution and compositions ph clearly affected the distribution of pn in different fractions of eps while ps was almost uniformly distributed along sludge eps layers fig 5 which agrees with previous studies yu et al 2008 total eps content increased with the increase of ph which means that cell lysis and transformation of organic matter from pellets to eps was enhanced by increasing ph especially to sb eps the dissociation of acidic groups in eps and the repulsions between the negatively charged eps are responsible for the enhanced transformation of organic matter gonzalez et al 2018 lb eps content was lower than tb eps in all reactors especially at ph 10 this could be due to the availability of lb eps to microbes 3 3 2 ftir spectra of tb and lb eps in general the peaks detected at other ph values became weak or absent at ph 10 fig s4 for lb eps the bands appearing at 1700 1500 cm 1 at ph 10 were weaker when exposed to other ph the band at 1569 cm 1 was not detected at ph 10 but was detected at the other ph values moreover this band was only detected in dom at ph 10 fig 2a this phenomenon illustrates that at ph 10 proteins in lb eps were largely released and lb eps are available to microbes yu et al 2008 thus the large differences among the ftir spectra of lb eps might be due to the combined alkali and biotic effect hydrolysis of tb eps and degradation of resultant organics played a key role in protein solubilization xiao et al 2017 in the ftir spectra of tb eps the bands at 1520 cm 1 1590 cm 1 and 1630 cm 1 became weak at the increase of ph the results indicate that alkaline fermentation can efficiently attack proteins in the tb eps layer and convert those proteins into bulk liquid a band at 1410 cm 1 at ph 10 was weaker there than at any of the other ph values two weak bands at 1350 cm 1 and 1330 cm 1 were only detected in tb eps at ph uncontrolled 7 and 8 the results imply that increasing fermentative ph to 9 or 10 can promote the hydrolysis of carboxylic group containing and hydrocarbon like compounds in tb eps however two weak peaks at 1002 cm1 and 1157 cm 1 were only detected in tb eps at ph 9 and 10 compared with ps alkaline fermentation can better promote the release of pn in tb eps the results suggest that increasing the fermentation ph to 10 can efficiently promote the release and hydrolysis of organic compounds especially proteins in lb and tb eps 3 3 3 eem spectra of tb and lb eps eem spectra of lb and tb eps in the reactors with different ph are shown in fig s5 and fig s6 peaks belonging to aromatic protein like humic like and fulvic like substances were observed in all the samples in lb and tb eps the fluorescence intensity of those peaks was the lowest at ph 10 an obvious decrease in the protein like substances fluorescence intensity appeared at ph 9 and 10 this phenomenon is consistent with the observations by ftir implying the efficient hydrolysis of eps especially protein occurring at ph 10 the decrease of humic like and fulvic like substances fluorescence intensity with increasing ph also explains the increase of fluorescence intensity of those substances in dom sb eps in general the fluorescence intensity of these peaks in tb eps was higher than in lb eps xiao et al 2017 observed similar results in ss alkaline pretreatment lb eps is the outer layer and its availability for microbes may be the reason behind this phenomenon 3 4 implications of dom characteristics in sludge alkaline fermentation this study found out that increasing the fermentative ph to 10 results in the highest easily biodegradable molecules and molecular diversity which contributes to the maximum vfas production meanwhile ph 10 also enhances the release of hard biodegradable materials e g lignin like substances moreover a large amount of n containing hard biodegradable molecules were generated at ph 10 a recent study has reported that sequencing batch reactor driven bnr process has difficulty in degrading humic like and fulvic like substances cao et al 2019b the problem lies in their less permeable not easily biodegradable nature which has proven to be adverse to the effluent quality and advanced treatment i e increase the diversity of effluent organic matter and do harm to the reuse of treated wastewater in wwtps michael kordatou et al 2015 ni et al 2011 taken together fermentation of ss at ph 10 can significantly enhance vfas production but further studies are needed to reduce the hard biodegradable organic matter coagulation has been widely used to separate alkaline fermentation liquid li et al 2011 liu et al 2018 recently song et al 2019 reported that the removal efficiency of humic acid by coagulation using alcl3 can reach to 80 moreover using alkaline fermentation liquid as carbon source humic acid can improve short cut nitrification denitrification ji and chen 2010 if combining with membrane bioreactors the hard biodegradable dom can also be removed the results of this study provide fundamental information about dom characteristics and add to the body of knowledge needed to achieve a comprehensive understanding of ss alkaline fermentation 4 conclusions this paper focused on the functional groups fluorescent components and molecular characteristics of dom as well as the molecular weight of pn in saf for vfas production results show that increasing ph to 10 can lead to a significantly enhanced hydrolysis of tryptophan like and tyrosine like substances and increases the content of low mw pn p 0 05 eps analysis also confirmed the enhanced hydrolysis of those dom dom molecular features revealed that ph 10 results in the highest molecular diversity and generation or degradation of easily degradable substrates the enhanced hydrolysis of those dom contributes to the vfas production however increasing fermentative ph also promotes the generation of hard biodegradable organic matter e g humic like and lignin like substances at ph 10 a large amount of hard biodegradable n containing molecules were also observed anaerobic fermentation of ss at ph 10 is favored to enhance vfas production and can also result in a higher content of refractory dom to further promote ss alkaline fermentation as an appropriate solution for both ss treatment and vfas production more studies are required to assess the influence of ss alkaline fermentation liquid on effluent quality of

removal bnr process dissolved organic matter dom in fermentation liquid is the direct substrate used for producing vfas and can greatly influence the effluent quality of bnr process however knowledge of dom characteristics in sludge alkaline fermentation is limited this study focused on the functional groups fluorescent components and molecular features of dom as well as molecular weight of

because of its high organic matter content anaerobic digestion ad is widely used for ss treatment and can produce volatile fatty acids vfas or methane appels et al 2008 chen et al 2007 vfas can act as superior carbon sources for biological nutrient removal bnr process ad of ss for vfas generation is an attractive strategy for producing carbon sources for bnr process li et al 2011 yu et al 2008 prior to vfas production hydrolysis of insoluble organic matter to dissolved organic matter dom and acidification of the generated dom to vfas are necessary steps chen et al 2017 ma et al 2019 the rate limiting step is hydrolysis therefore enhancing the hydrolysis and acidification of ss is of great interest alkaline fermentation especially ph 10 can greatly improve the hydrolysis and acidification of ss resulting in a substantially enhanced vfas production liu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 many studies have been performed to investigate the mechanism of improved hydrolysis and acidification by ss alkaline fermentation saf especially at ph 10 chen et al 2017 li et al 2011 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2009 zheng et al 2013 generally these studies point out that saf can break extracellular polymeric substances eps matrix and increase dom concentration as well as inhibit methanogens especially increase protein pn concentration chen et al 2017 maspolim et al 2015 which significantly favors vfas production the increase of dom is one of the most important reasons for vfas production chen et al 2007 wang et al 2019 in hydrolysis stage complex dom is produced chen et al 2017 and dom is the direct substrate for vfas generation yekta et al 2012 not only the dom concentration but also the characteristics of dom significantly influence its transformation to vfas chen et al 2017 kamjunke et al 2017 moreover information about the features of refractory dom produced during saf should be given because the refractory dom may adversely affect the effluent quality of bnr process or following treatment azman et al 2017 cao et al 2019a 2019b maizel and remucal 2017 however our understanding of dom characteristics in saf is still limited chen et al 2017 characterized the dom in saf with stepwise ph increase and found that increasing ph led to an increase of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic doc such as building blocks high molecular weight mw and low mw protein recently cao et al 2019b reported that building blocks were the dominant refractory dom in effluent of sludge alkaline fermentation liquid driven denitrification the complex and diverse saf driven dom requires a multi method analytical characterization detailed information on dom characteristics and dom transformation is essential to obtaining a better understanding on the mechanism of improved hydrolysis acidification by saf and helps identify potential implications when applying the fermentation liquid to the bnr process fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms can provide precise molecular formulas in the complex dom matrices the fticr ms gives novel insight and greater recognition of the molecular characteristics of complex dom osborne et al 2013 valle et al 2018 proteins pn are the principal part of dom and intensive pn degradation is the leading cause of enhanced vfas production in saf wu et al 2010 zheng et al 2013 macromolecular pn can be hydrolyzed into micromolecular pn at alkaline conditions then the anaerobes can directly take up organic matter that is smaller than 1 kda for vfas production chen et al 2017 found that saf with a stepwise ph increase enhanced the solubilization of both low and high mw protein unfortunately the study did not determine the content of mw 1 kda protein recently cao et al 2019b reported that high mw pn were potential refractory dom moreover types of soluble proteins can also be influenced by different ph values xiao et al 2017 those characteristics of pn would largely affect its application as feed stuff nevertheless little is known about the characteristics of soluble pn in saf with different ph values the dom can result from both eps and intracellular organics in ss the transformation of organics from pellet to tightly bound eps tb eps and loosely bound eps lb eps as well as soluble eps sb eps represent the release characteristics of ss li et al 2014b it is well known that eps is the dominant component of organics in ss yu et al 2008 found that the transfer of pn from tb eps to sb eps is accompanied by the degradation of pn however previous studies mainly used batch experiments or characterized the eps in terms of pn and ps content jin et al 2016 the chemical characteristics of eps are known to affect its solubilization and biodegradability therefore investigations on eps features are helpful for understanding the improved hydrolysis and acidification by saf this study investigated the characteristics of dom in sludge alkaline fermentation with different ph values for vfas production the functional groups fluorescent components and molecular characteristics of dom and molecular weight distribution of pn were analyzed the changes in eps characteristics were also studied the results would deepen our understanding of enhanced sludge hydrolysis and acidification by alkaline fermentation in addition the potential refractory dom characteristics were also identified and thus provide essential information for further treatment together this paper helps to get a better insight into alkaline fermentation of ss for vfas production 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge characteristics and semi continuous fermentation reactors operation the ss used in this study was collected from the secondary clarifier in a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp nanjing china raw ss was filtered through a 1 6 mm sieve to remove debris and stored at 4 c seeding sludge was collected from a mesophilic anaerobic digester and detailed information of the digester is presented in our previous study ma et al 2019 the features of raw ss and inoculum were ph 6 7 0 1 and 7 1 0 1 total solids ts 19 36 0 68 and 17 94 0 41 g l volatile solids vs 11 91 0 37 and 9 23 0 22

carry out the alkaline fermentation of ss which were made by plexiglass and each reactors had a total and working volume of 800 ml and 400 ml many studies have reported that ph 11 was adverse to the further vfas production chen et al 2007 maspolim et al 2015 therefore ph 10 was the highest ph value in this study the reactors were referred to as ph uncontrolled ph 7 ph 8 ph 9 and ph 10 respectively the ph was maintained by adding 2 m sodium hydroxide three times a day with the help of a fe20 ph meter and probe mettler toledo llc toledo oh usa all reactors were stirred at 100 rpm and maintained at 37 c through a shaking cultivating chamber seeding sludge and raw ss was 1 1 vs vs fifty ml of digestate was discharged and 50 ml of raw ss was added to the reactors everyday resulting in a solids retention time srt of 8 d li et al 2014b and an organic loading rate of 1 49 g vs l d after raw ss was added and ph was adjusted each time n2 was used to purge the reactors for 2 min

days after operating the reactors for 6 srt samples 3 were collected and analyzed among them triplicate samples were used for analysis of the soluble pn molecular weight distribution all the samples were centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min then were collected and filtrated through 0 45 μm fiber filter all the samples were collected before adding raw ss 2 3 analysis of dom characteristics freeze dried dom and eps were used to detect the ftir spectrum by a nexus870 ftir spectrometer thermo fisher scientific ashville nc usa in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 and resolution of 4 cm 1 three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem was used to analyze the fluorescent components of dom and eps by a fluorescent spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi high technologies corporation tokyo japan furthermore 25 dom samples were used for the parallel factor analysis parafac detailed information about eem measurement and parafac are presented in the supporting information for the analysis of dom molecular characteristics the filtrated 0 45 μm liquid sample was adjusted to ph 2 then solid phase extraction spe cartridges 1 g 6 ml functionalized styrene divinyl benzene polymer resin supelco were used to extract the dom the extracted dom was detected by a 9 4 t fticr ms bruker daltonics bremen germany methods for fticr ms measurement can be found in our previous studies hu et al 2018 all formulas were determined using bruker dataanalysis software version 4 1 and matlab routines kujawinski and behn 2006 other chemical constraints were described in the supporting information the mw distribution of pn was classified as follows 1 1 10 10 30 and 30 kda filters millipore corp usa with mw cutoffs of 1 10 and 30 kda were used to conduct the mw fractions with a 400 ml amicon model 8400 stirred cell unit milliporesigma corp burlington ma usa 2 4 eps extraction eps were extracted according to the method described in sun et al 2018 briefly 50 ml of digestate was collected and centrifuged 4000 g 15 min and the bulk solution was collected as the sb eps these supernatant were further used to analyze the characteristics of dom the solids were resuspended to 50 ml using a 0 05

visualization 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the fermentation reactors the scod generated at ph 8 2423 54 83 mg l 9 4533 66 24 mg l and 10 6448 72 37 mg l were significantly higher than that at ph 7 and uncontrolled reactors 1403 33 87 and 1315 40 94 mg l p 0 05 t test the total vfas production also increased from 722 3 34 21 to 3762 204 68 mg cod l as ph increased from uncontrolled and 7 to 10 fig 1 c the results are consistent with yu et al 2008 and chen et al 2007 implying that increasing ph to 10 can highly improve the hydrolysis and acidification efficiency of ss as shown in fig s1 increasing ph also inhibited the ch4 production at ph 10 no ch4 was produced and h2 yield was 15 34 ml g vs the improved hydrolysis and acidification and the inhibited methanogenesis zheng et al 2013 at alkaline ph accounted for the increase of scod and tvfas the soluble pn concentration at ph 8 9 and 10 387 5 1338 8 mg cod l were significantly higher than that at ph of uncontrolled and 7 265 7 284 8 mg cod l p 0 05 t test zhang et al 2009 also found that by increasing the fermentation ph from 7 to 10 soluble pn increased from 41 to 163 mg cod g vs it means that alkaline treatment can efficiently promote the solubilization of pn in ss xiao et al 2017 soluble ps increased slightly with the increase of ph and its content was lower than the content of pn in all the reactors it is agreed with previous studies that pn is the dominant fraction of dom chen et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 unknown scod also increased from 152 3 to 185 6 mg l to 304 1 975 4 mg l as the ph increased from uncontrolled and 7 to 8 9 and 10 unknown scod may be composed of humic acid and fulvic acid substance as well as dna ma et al 2019 the characteristics of dom can largely affect its transformation to vfas and degradation in following steps which was an incentive for further analysis of dom features in this study 3 2 characteristics of dom in alkaline fermentation reactors 3 2 1 ftir spectra of dom ftir spectra in the region of 1800 900 cm 1 is believed to offer primary information about functional groups of dom or eps wang et al 2018 zhu et al 2012 the ftir results fig 2 a contain five regions correlated with different functional groups amide i proteins 1700 1600 cm 1 amide ii proteins 1600 1500 cm 1 carboxylic group containing and hydrocarbon like compounds 1500 1300 cm 1 amide iii proteins 1300 1200 cm 1 and polysaccharides and nucleic acids 1200 900 cm 1 wang et al 2018 badireddy et al 2010 as is shown in fig 2a diverse bands appeared revealing the complex functional groups of dom the functional groups of the five dom samples were similar a closer observation found that a band at 1569 cm 1 was only detected at ph 10 implying that the content of co nh at ph 10 was relatively higher than at other ph values wang et al 2018 a weak band at 1157 cm 1 was only detected at ph uncontrolled and 7 which means the dom contained a relatively higher amount of polysaccharide than that at ph 8 9 and 10 these results agree with previous studies wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2013 implying that saf can efficiently enhance the hydrolysis of proteins 3 2 2 dom fluorescent components eem parafac modeling of the 25 samples generated a six components model fig s2 and table 1 the identified components consisted of four protein like components tryptophan like c1 c2 and c3 tyrosine like c4 one fulvic like component c5 and one humic like component c6 ishii and boyer 2012 li et al 2014a the fluorescence intensity of the components increased with the increase of ph fig 2b especially the protein like components p 0 05 this finding agrees with the ftir results illustrating that increasing fermentation ph to 10 can efficiently enhance the hydrolysis of proteins previous studies also observed that protein like fulvic like and humic like substances in liquid increased with the increase of ph in alkaline pretreatment of ss li et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 the fluorescence intensity of protein like substances was higher than that of fulvic like and humic like substances in all the reactors protein like substances c1 c2 c3 and c4 are the major and easily biodegradable substrate especially compared to humic like substances for vfas production li et al 2014a reported that tryptophan like materials degraded gradually while tyrosine like materials fluctuated over time during a 43 days s ad of dewatered ss the accumulation of these dom at alkaline ph might be due to the combined effect of low srt 8 d the highly enhanced release of protein the possibly inhibited acidogenesis chen et al 2017 and their biodegradable mechanisms li et al 2014a while fulvic like and humic like substances are hard biodegradable materials cao et al 2019a zhang et al 2016 li et al 2019 found that humic acids can promote acidification of ss polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon can enhance acetic acid production in ss fermentation luo et al 2016 increasing fermentation ph has been shown to increase the hydrolysis of protein like fulvic like and humic like substances which further favors vfas production especially at ph 10 however the highest vfas and scod production and fulvic like and humic like substances were simultaneous at a fermentation ph 10 cao et al 2019b found that fulvic like and humic like substances in fermentation liquid were difficult to be degraded in sequencing batch reactor driven denitrification process moreover an extended hrt also had a minor effect on the removal efficiency the presence of this type of dom may inhibit the n removal efficiency and deteriorate the effluent fernandes et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 therefore further studies are required to determine more efficient removal of fulvic like and humic like substances in saf liquid ph 10 especially when considering the reuse of treated wastewater in wwtps michael kordatou et al 2015 ni et al 2011 3 2 3 molecular characteristics van krevelen diagrams fig s3 according to the molar ratio of h c and o c were used to analyze the entire formulas detected in the dom samples kamjunke et al 2017 dom formulas were mainly located in the region of h c of 0 7 2 2 and the o c of 0 1 0 8 which agree with previous studies ma et al 2019 yekta et al 2012 the amount of assigned formulas of the reactors with ph uncontrolled 7 8 9 and 10 were 4493 4682 5338 5545 and 5668 respectively the increased diversity of assigned formulas illustrated that the hydrolysis of organic matter was enhanced by increasing the fermentative ph to further distinguish the dom characteristics the differential molecular formulas between ph uncontrolled and ph 7 8 9 and 10 were analyzed fig 3 with the increase of ph more and more differential molecular formulas appeared lipid like and h c 1 8 of proteins amino sugars like molecules decreased at ph 8 9 and 10 compared with ph uncontrolled these compounds form the major and easily degradable substrates to fermentative bacteria for vfas production combined with the increased vfas production fig 1b and the decreased eps content fig 5 a reasonable inference is that the hydrolysis and degradation of these compounds was highly enhanced at ph of 8 9 and 10 h c 1 7 of proteins amino sugars like dom are potential aromatic compounds hu et al 2018 and increased with the increase of ph which is consistent with the observations by eem increasing dom molecules were found in the carbohydrate like region with the increase of ph and its diversity was lower than proteins amino sugars increasing lignin like and tannins like substances were also found with the increase of ph lignin like substances and tannins like substances are potential aromatic and hard biodegradable material ma et al 2019 hertkorn et al 2006 the degradation of carboxylic and alicyclic organic compounds can lead to an increase of lignin like substances hertkorn et al 2006 moreover lignocellulosic matter is one of the components of ss hao et al 2017 the numerous lignin like molecules in high ph reactors especially ph 10 were most likely attributed to the high degradation of proteins and or the low degradation of the hydrolytic lignocellulosic matter therefore it is suggested that both higher molecular diversity and greater generation or degradation of easily degradable substrates accounted for the improved vfas production in saf meanwhile hard biodegradable molecules were also greatly generated especially ph 10 n containing compounds are related to the transformation of proteins in ss xiao et al 2017 the number of n containing molecules was 2558 uncontrolled 2484 7 2703 8 2789 9 and 2894 10 which indicated that hydrolysis or transformation of those compounds were enhanced by increasing ph lu et al 2018 also found that alkaline pretreatment led to a large amount of n compounds the large numbers of n containing molecules in the reactors may be because proteins are the major component of ss and the key substrate for bacteria or alkalinity among the n containing molecules 2303 ph 10 2181 ph 9 2072 ph 8 1924 ph 7 and 1825 ph uncontrolled molecules were located in lignin like and tannins like regions xiao et al 2017 reported that the dominant n species was pyridine n in sludge after alkaline pretreatment and cyclization of amine n intermediates may generate heterocyclic n compounds the high diversity of hard biodegradable n containing molecules at ph 10 may increase the diversity of soluble n containing organic matter in effluent of bnr eom et al 2017 which would be adverse to the effluent quality of bnr process 3 2 4 molecular weight distribution of soluble proteins the mw distribution of soluble pn in the reactors with different ph is shown in fig 4 mw 30 kda pn was more dominant than mw 30 kda pn in all reactors xiao et al 2017 also found that after a 30 min pretreatment of ss at ph of 6 3 10 mw 20 kda pn was the dominant pn mw 1 kda pn increased from 53 26 7 98 to 381 5 38 4 mg l as the ph increased p 0 05 implying that the microbes in reactors with higher ph possessed more pn that can be directly degraded this phenomenon also accounted for the enhanced vfas production at saf chen et al 2017 also found that low mw pn was accumulated with increased ph levels and the profiles of those dom might be a reason for this phenomenon besides the mentioned reasons in section 3 2 2 the mainly accumulated proteins amino sugars like dom at high ph levels is tend to have low h c 1 7 and high unsaturated degree table 2 which also likely limits their quick degradation under restrained retention time hu et al 2018 yekta et al 2012 the percentage of mw 1 kda pn at ph of uncontrolled 7 8 9 and 10 was 30 06 33 35 44 55 52 60 and 42 74 respectively this phenomenon illustrates that increasing ph promotes the transformation of pn from high mw to low mw the decreased percentage of mw 1 kda pn at ph 10 may result from the efficient degradation of those pn previous studies have reported that pn degrading microbes were significantly accumulated in ss fermentation at ph 10 huang et al 2016 zheng et al 2013 alkaline fermentation of ss not only enhanced the hydrolysis of pn but also enhanced the transformation of pn from high mw to low mw which further favored the vfas production mw 30 kda pn also showed a significant increase at ph 10 176 4 18 0 mg l high mw pn can account for 13 37 17 39 of the refractory dom in effluent of bnr process using sludge alkaline fermentation liquid as its carbon source cao et al 2019b enhanced transformation of high mw pn to vfas in the reactor at ph 10 would be meaningful because of those pn are also good substrate for fermentative bacteria but may be adverse to bnr process effluent quality 3 3 eps characteristics in alkaline fermentation reactors 3 3 1 eps distribution and compositions ph clearly affected the distribution of pn in different fractions of eps while ps was almost uniformly distributed along sludge eps layers fig 5 which agrees with previous studies yu et al 2008 total eps content increased with the increase of ph which means that cell lysis and transformation of organic matter from pellets to eps was enhanced by increasing ph especially to sb eps the dissociation of acidic groups in eps and the repulsions between the negatively charged eps are responsible for the enhanced transformation of organic matter gonzalez et al 2018 lb eps content was lower than tb eps in all reactors especially at ph 10 this could be due to the availability of lb eps to microbes 3 3 2 ftir spectra of tb and lb eps in general the peaks detected at other ph values became weak or absent at ph 10 fig s4 for lb eps the bands appearing at 1700 1500 cm 1 at ph 10 were weaker when exposed to other ph the band at 1569 cm 1 was not detected at ph 10 but was detected at the other ph values moreover this band was only detected in dom at ph 10 fig 2a this phenomenon illustrates that at ph 10 proteins in lb eps were largely released and lb eps are available to microbes yu et al 2008 thus the large differences among the ftir spectra of lb eps might be due to the combined alkali and biotic effect hydrolysis of tb eps and degradation of resultant organics played a key role in protein solubilization xiao et al 2017 in the ftir spectra of tb eps the bands at 1520 cm 1 1590 cm 1 and 1630 cm 1 became weak at the increase of ph the results indicate that alkaline fermentation can efficiently attack proteins in the tb eps layer and convert those proteins into bulk liquid a band at 1410 cm 1 at ph 10 was weaker there than at any of the other ph values two weak bands at 1350 cm 1 and 1330 cm 1 were only detected in tb eps at ph uncontrolled 7 and 8 the results imply that increasing fermentative ph to 9 or 10 can promote the hydrolysis of carboxylic group containing and hydrocarbon like compounds in tb eps however two weak peaks at 1002 cm1 and 1157 cm 1 were only detected in tb eps at ph 9 and 10 compared with ps alkaline fermentation can better promote the release of pn in tb eps the results suggest that increasing the fermentation ph to 10 can efficiently promote the release and hydrolysis of organic compounds especially proteins in lb and tb eps 3 3 3 eem spectra of tb and lb eps eem spectra of lb and tb eps in the reactors with different ph are shown in fig s5 and fig s6 peaks belonging to aromatic protein like humic like and fulvic like substances were observed in all the samples in lb and tb eps the fluorescence intensity of those peaks was the lowest at ph 10 an obvious decrease in the protein like substances fluorescence intensity appeared at ph 9 and 10 this phenomenon is consistent with the observations by ftir implying the efficient hydrolysis of eps especially protein occurring at ph 10 the decrease of humic like and fulvic like substances fluorescence intensity with increasing ph also explains the increase of fluorescence intensity of those substances in dom sb eps in general the fluorescence intensity of these peaks in tb eps was higher than in lb eps xiao et al 2017 observed similar results in ss alkaline pretreatment lb eps is the outer layer and its availability for microbes may be the reason behind this phenomenon 3 4 implications of dom characteristics in sludge alkaline fermentation this study found out that increasing the fermentative ph to 10 results in the highest easily biodegradable molecules and molecular diversity which contributes to the maximum vfas production meanwhile ph 10 also enhances the release of hard biodegradable materials e g lignin like substances moreover a large amount of n containing hard biodegradable molecules were generated at ph 10 a recent study has reported that sequencing batch reactor driven bnr process has difficulty in degrading humic like and fulvic like substances cao et al 2019b the problem lies in their less permeable not easily biodegradable nature which has proven to be adverse to the effluent quality and advanced treatment i e increase the diversity of effluent organic matter and do harm to the reuse of treated wastewater in wwtps michael kordatou et al 2015 ni et al 2011 taken together fermentation of ss at ph 10 can significantly enhance vfas production but further studies are needed to reduce the hard biodegradable organic matter coagulation has been widely used to separate alkaline fermentation liquid li et al 2011 liu et al 2018 recently song et al 2019 reported that the removal efficiency of humic acid by coagulation using alcl3 can reach to 80 moreover using alkaline fermentation liquid as carbon source humic acid can improve short cut nitrification denitrification ji and chen 2010 if combining with membrane bioreactors the hard biodegradable dom can also be removed the results of this study provide fundamental information about dom characteristics and add to the body of knowledge needed to achieve a comprehensive understanding of ss alkaline fermentation 4 conclusions this paper focused on the functional groups fluorescent components and molecular characteristics of dom as well as the molecular weight of pn in saf for vfas production results show that increasing ph to 10 can lead to a significantly enhanced hydrolysis of tryptophan like and tyrosine like substances and increases the content of low mw pn p 0 05 eps analysis also confirmed the enhanced hydrolysis of those dom dom molecular features revealed that ph 10 results in the highest molecular diversity and generation or degradation of easily degradable substrates the enhanced hydrolysis of those dom contributes to the vfas production however increasing fermentative ph also promotes the generation of hard biodegradable organic matter e g humic like and lignin like substances at ph 10 a large amount of hard biodegradable n containing molecules were also observed anaerobic fermentation of ss at ph 10 is favored to enhance vfas production and can also result in a higher content of refractory dom to further promote ss alkaline fermentation as an appropriate solution for both ss treatment and vfas production more studies are required to assess the influence of ss alkaline fermentation liquid on effluent quality of bnr process and find treatment methods to eliminate refractory dom declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

18574,a novel full scale prefix oxic coking wastewater cww biological treatment o h o system had been operated steadily six years with the effluent quality meeting national discharge standard comparing to the traditional cww biological treatment process which usually have an anaerobic unit at the start of the process here the o h o system has obvious advantages in cod removal total nitrogen removal and reduced energy consumption it is very necessary to illustrate the structure and function of the microbial community involved in different bioreactors of the o h o system high throughput miseq sequencing was used to examine the 16s rrna genes in this system results revealed a contrasting microbial composition among the activated sludge samples of three sequential bioreactors the β proteobacteria related sequences dominated in the o1 activated sludge with the relative abundance of 56 44 while 7 53 of the sequences were assigned to thiobacillus rhodoplanes related sequences dominated in the bioreactor h and o2 activated sludge with relative abundance of 8 86 and 8 92 respectively the physico chemical characteristics of cww were analyzed by standard methods and the operational parameters were routinely monitored to examine their effects on the microbial communities the bioinformatics software package of phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust was used to predict the microbial community functional profiling and found three dominant genera of rhodoplanes lysobacter and leucobacter enriched the xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism pathway the diverse and distinct microbial community involved in biological treatment processes of cww treatment indicating that water characteristics and operational parameters determined the microbial community composition these results significantly expanded our knowledge of the biodiversity and population dynamics of microorganisms and discerned the relationships between bacterial communities and environmental variables in the biological treatment processes moreover in this study we proposed a comprehensive biodegradation model of cww treatment and defined as o h o system graphical abstract image 1 keywords coking wastewater microbiology activated sludge bacterial community 16s rdna 1 introduction the coking wastewater cww is produced in the industrial processes of coal coking gas purification coke recovery coal liquefaction and is a typical abundant industrial organic hard biodegradable wastewater containing refractory pollutant it is the most representative one of coal chemical wastewaters and is typically characterized by complex composition and high toxicity the cww have complex inorganic and organic contaminants and some of them are refractory highly concentrated toxic mutative and carcinogenic such as ammonia phenolic compounds cyanide poly nuclear aromatic hydrocarbons pahs thiocyanide oxygen and sulfur containing heterocyclics and acyclic compounds pan et al 2019 zhang et al 2012b in addition some of priority pollutants have been frequently and persistently detected in cww and sludge systems and pose a potential risk to natural environments and human health negreanu et al 2012 hence the cww is notorious for its toxicity and refractoriness and representing a major challenge to the management of cww treatment coking wastewater treatment is a multi billion dollar industry in the world and cww biological treatment has been applied widely with removing more than 95 of the pollutants vazquez et al 2006 at present traditional activated sludge process is the main step for removing various organic matters which includes a o a a o a o h o a o o sbr and so on the industry generally believes that a a o process is a better process to treat cww but based on the previous studies we found that the first anaerobic unit in the a a o process did not perform biological function well due to the inhibition of methanogenic archaea by high concentration of toxic organic compounds zhu et al 2016 e g zhao et al 2014 found that the influent cod concentration was 1530 mg l 1 and the effluent cod concentration of anaerobic unit of an a o h o process was 1390 mg l 1 sahariah et al 2015 also found that the removal efficiencies of phenol and cod were only 3 and 2 respectively in the anaerobic unit of an a a o process for cww treatment so we designed a novel prefix oxic cww biological treatment o h o system which treat cww with oxic bioreactor 1 o1 firstly and follow by hydrolytic bioreactor h oxic bioreactor 2 o2 as a general abbreviation o h o is used in places we used o1 h o2 to distinguish the first and the second oxic bioreactor where necessary the o h o system had operated steadily six years with the national standard of the discharge quality gb16171 2012 china the function of high load decarburization reaction the reactions of hydrolysis and denitrification complete nitrification and mineralization reactions were performed in the sequential of the designed bioreactors of o1 h o2 respectively comparing to the a a o process the o h o system has significant advantages in cod removal total nitrogen removal and reduced energy consumption the cod concentrations in the secondary effluent of the a a o and o h o process are the range of 200 300 and 150 200 mg l 1 respectively chen et al 2019 kong et al 2018 due to the realization of anammox partial denitrification and other enhanced denitrifications in bioreactor h the effluent concentration of total nitrogen can be lower than 20 mg l 1 in o h o process pan et al 2019 additionally the o h o process also saves energy as compare to the a a o process due to higher oxygen use efficiency and the absence of sludge the hydraulic retention time in the o h o process was only two thirds compare to the a a o process under same effluent concentration of cod the reduced hrt also results in additional energy savings zhou et al 2018 it is very necessary to illustrate the structure and function of the microbial community involved in different bioreactors to give a theoretical evidence of the o h o system the activated sludge technology was used extensively in cww biological treatment processes in which a complex prokaryotic microbial consortium played an important role in the processes of oxygen depleting organics toxics and nutrients removal and preventing discharge of pathogens ye and zhang 2011 despite the environmental and economic importance of the cww treatment the structure and function of microbial community involved in the novel prefix oxic cww treatment o h o system has not yet been precisely characterized and this process remains a black box with limited efficiency bai et al 2011a 2011b zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2010 zhu et al 2013 thus a thorough knowledge of the ecology of the cww activated sludge communities is required to improve o h o system operation and stability therefore there is an increasing interest in revealing the abundance diversity function and distribution of corresponding species present in this o h o coking wastewater activated sludge bai et al 2010 2011b zhu et al 2013 the structure and function of microbial community in cww biological treatment processes have been investigated sporadically using culture independent molecular methods the applications of conventional molecular techniques in the last decades such as terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism t rflp fluorescence in situ hybridization fish denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge 16s rrna clone libraries etc have provided new insights into microbial community composition bai et al 2010 2011b zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2010 in cww biological treatment processes however these methods generally are difficult to detect most of the low abundance members in cww microbial community thus provide incomplete information about the microbial community and diversity within the cww biological treatment system xia et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 the illumina miseq sequencing can generate hundreds of thousands of short sequences and significantly improve researchers ability to investigate the low abundance microorganisms exploring these previously undetected rare taxa is critical since they may play an important role in resistance and resilience of the community and in the stability of the microbial ecosystem liang et al 2014 shade et al 2012 qiu et al 2019 the advent of high throughput sequencing technology now affords new opportunities to address these knowledge gaps by comprehensively characterizing microbial communities in the biological process of cww treatment system and to examine the relationships between microbial communities and environmental variables in cww treatment to our knowledge there have been no molecular microbial diversity surveys of the novel full scale prefix oxic cww treatment system and unit variations of these diverse communities in relation to process performance remain little known ha et al 2012 silva et al 2012 in this study a taxonomic and functional metagenomics approach was used to analyze the structure and function of microbial community associated with the novel full scale prefix oxic cww treatment system composed of three sequential bioreactors oxic 1 hydrolytic oxic 2 o1 h o2 utilizing three phase fluidized bed technology the contaminants removal efficiency was measured and operating parameters were monitored during the long term stable operation illumina miseq high throughput sequencing was performed to reveal the relative abundance and diversity of microbiology in bioreactor o1 h and o2 an exploratory bioinformatics tool phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust was used to predict the cww activated sludge community function based on 16s rrna genes information the objectives of this study include 1 revelation of variations in the microbiological abundance diversity and function in the cww activated sludge samples from the o h o reactors chain 2 identification of the dominant microbial community responsible for the cww treatment and presume the biodegradation potential of dominant bacterial genera in the corresponding bioreactor 3 to discerned the relationships between bacterial communities and environmental variables in the novel o h o biological processes of full scale cww treatment system to the best of our knowledge this study describes the first effort to reveal the structure and function of microbial community involved in the novel industrial scale prefix oxic cww treatment o h o system which could be used to monitor cww activated sludge s biodegradation ability for organic pollutants and to evaluate cww treatment efficiency 2 methods and materials 2 1 full scale o h o cww treatment system and sample collection a novel full scale prefix oxic cww treatment system an on going three phase fluidized bed biological cww treatment system in tianjin iron and steel corporation shexian hebei province of china was studied the raw cww passed the primary treatment stage comprised of oil separation ammonia stripping and ph equalization being further directed to the sequential biological treatment the biological treatment processes is comprised of three fluidized bed reactors oxic

the final effluent meets the national standard of the discharge quality gb16171 2012 china in order to release the accidental event shock this system has two serial of parallel bioreactors dependently which named south and north subsystem respectively this system has been operating for 6 years at daily capacity of approximately 2400 160 m3 of cww the total hydraulic retention time hrt of the

the design of biological reactor directly influenced the reaction efficiency and microbial population in order to deal with high cod load rate 2 03 kg cod m3d an internal loop multiphase airlift fluidized bed reactor was developed by the authors wei et al 2000 and applied in the current system the internal loop design ensured the efficient mixing and mass transfer with low energy consumption zhang et al 2012a temperatures for the three bioreactors were relatively constant between 19 and 23 c in the long term performance table 1 the average ph of the bioreactor o1 h and o2 were maintained at 7 15 7 09 and 7 01 respectively the dissolved oxygen do concentration in the bioreactor h was maintained in the range of 0 3 0 46 mg l 1 while the do level of the other two aerobic bioreactors were maintained in the range between 2 37 2 99 and 3 15 3 37 mg l 1 respectively the hydraulic retention time hrt of the bioreactor o1 h and o2 were 60 8 18 3 20 4 h respectively the sludge retention times srts of the bioreactor o1 h and o2 were 8 2 33 5 18 3 days respectively this long srt was beneficial for the generation and evolution of specific functional microorganism species such as anammox ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob the concentrations of activated sludge varied across the range of 2590 4920 mg l 1 over the course of the operation the srt was controlled by removal of excess sludge resulting in different mlss concentrations in the biological treatment processes the operational parameters e g do mlss srt etc can be regulated to optimize the performance detailed operational information of the novel full scale prefix oxic cww treatment system was given in table 1 as reflected by the cww quality the microbial community in different bioreactor kept adjusting to the wastewater characteristic and operation conditions 2 3 dna extraction microbial genomic dna was extracted using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio usa according to the manufacturer s protocol dna quality was assessed by the ratios of 260 280 nm and 260 230 nm absorption measured by an nd 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa and agarose gel electrophoresis 2 4 pcr amplification and barcoded miseq sequencing of 16s rrna genes the v4 hypervariable region of 16s rrna gene was pcr amplified triplicate reactions for each sample using primers f515 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and r806 5 ggactacvsgggtatctaat 3 following the procedures described by zhu et al 2016 this primer set has been demonstrated in silico to be universal for nearly all bacterial and archaeal taxa an 8 bp error correcting tag was added to the forward primer replicate amplicons of each sample were pooled and purified using a qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen a single composite dna sample for miseq sequencing was prepared by combining approximately equimolar amount of purified pcr products from each sludge sample the sequences have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive under the accession number srr9651087 srr9651104 2 5 miseq sequencing and sequence analysis the composition of the pcr products of v4 region of 16s rrna genes was determined by miseq sequencing samples in this study were individually barcoded to enable multiplex sequencing after miseq sequencing the raw data were processed and analyzed following the pipelines of mothur and qiime raw data were denoised using the mothur implementation of pyronoise algorithm chimeric sequences were identified and removed using uchime edgar et al 2011 quality sequences were assigned to samples according to their unique 8 bp barcodes operational taxonomic units otus defined at the 97 sequence similarity level were picked using average neighbor method after the needleman alignment and a single linkage precluster procedure taxonomy classification was identified using rdp classifier at the 80 confidence threshold by default alpha number of otus chao 1 and simpson and shannon indices diversity were statistically analyzed via rarefaction with all data sets normalized to 11 131 reads the minimum number of effective sequences generated for the 18 activated sludge subsamples per subsample good s coverage estimators representing the subsample coverage were calculated using the mothur software to explore the functional profiles of the bacterial community data set a bioinformatics tool predicting gene family abundances was used based on 16s gene surveys given a database of phylogenetically referenced genomes picrust langille et al 2013 this analysis was derived from observation of association between phylogeny and gene content for the analysis otus were closed reference picked against the 18 may 2012 greengenes database using qiime v 1 7 according to the online protocol the resulting data set was rarefied at 11 131 16s rrna sequences per sample these data were used to assess the difference between gene functions of the sequential cww activated sludge bacteria 2 6 principal component analysis the description of multiple parameters might become verbose and confusing in order to extract the dominating parameter set in biological treatment processes of o h o system the pca was conducted the environmental parameters included the characteristics of cww and operational parameters such as cod phenols cyanides thiocyanate ammonia do sulfides etc variances were first normalized into an interval of 2 2 using standardizing program that embedded in spss 19 0 statistical software ibm usa the pca of normalized data set was conducted using spss 19 0 followed the similar processes in our previous studies ou et al 2014 3 results discussion 3 1 o h o performance functional stability of the o h o system was defined and quantified by the concentration of 14 cww indicators which include cod bod phenols cyanides thiocyanate ammonia tn tp tss toc sulfides oil pahs and bap table 2 shows the concentration range of the indictors in the operating bioreactor the cod removal during the operation period was approximately 97 4 with the average cod concentrations in the raw water bioreactor o1 bioreactor h bioreactor o2 and biological effluent at 5451 612 520 193 and 140 mg l 1 respectively compared to a a o process the cod concentration of the secondary effluent of o h o process is always lower about 30 mg l 1 and the removal rate of refractory components was promoted by about 2 5 in the o h o system the main reasons were that most biodegradable compounds were degraded in the o1 unit and the residual refractory organics were hydrolyzed in the following h unit to improve the b c ratio for further aerobic removal in reactor o2 so the removal rates of refractory components were higher than these in the a a o process without hydrolysis this was evidenced by the pahs concentration in the secondary effluent of the o h o system 38 50 μg l which is lower than these in the a a o process 52 66 μg l kong et al 2018 zhang et al 2012b the phenols removal efficiency was approximately 99 5 in the prefix oxic bioreactor o1 cyanides were proven to be toxic to microorganisms kim et al 2013 luque almagro et al 2018 and nearly 97 3 of cyanides were removed firstly in the unit o1 the major function of h unit is denitrogen hydrolysis and to improve the b c ratio from 0 10 to 0 25 the cod in reactor h showed only a minor decrease from 612 to 520 mg l 1 and the bod increase from 69 to 108 mg l 1 due to hydrolysis after the unit of bioreactor o2 the ammonium removal in the biological effluent from o2 reached nearly 99 0 as shown in table 2 indicating the good performance of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and even anammox in the biological o h o process of cww treatment almost all scn which varied from 522 to 662 mg l 1 in the raw water was completely removed after the oxic bioreactor o2 this is consistent with kim s result that scn is aerobically degraded to a combination of ammonia carbonate and sulfate by several species of genus of thiobacillus which uses scn as a carbon and nitrogen source kim et al 2011 the concentration of sulfides in raw water was 150 7 mg l 1 it rapidly decreased to 0 21 0 12 mg l 1 after o2 stage with removal efficiency of 99 8 these results showed that the o h o system yielded stable contaminants removal efficiency with satisfactory performance and an interesting phenomenon was found that more than 90 of cod includes phenol cyanide thiocyanate etc were decomposed in the first oxic bioreactor by distinct bacteria in the following we would try to illustrate the structure and function of microbial community involved in different bioreactors in the o h o system 3 2 phylogenetic diversity analysis of sequences we used miseq sequencing to analyze the bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna genes across the 18 activated subsamples from three bioreactors of the o h o system a total of 384 459 effective sequences and 7745 otus were retrieved from the activated sludge samples 11 381 27 505 effective sequences were yielded for each subsample table 3 rdp classifier was used to assign these sequences into different otu with 3 of nucleotide cutoff the average of 617 767 and 801 otus were identified for the activated sludge samples of bioreactors o1 h and o2 according to a subset of 11131 randomly selected sequences respectively the otus numbers detected in the sludge of the o h o system are significantly smaller than observed in wwtps ye and zhang 2013 similarly to the previous studies on cww and other industrial wastewaters figuerola and erijman 2007 zhu et al 2013 the statistical analysis and rarefaction curves summarizing the otus clustered from these miseq sequencing reads are showed in table 3 and fig s1 respectively good s coverage revealed that the results represented the majority of bacterial 16s rrna sequences present in each subsample with values ranging from 95 8 to 97 6 to assess the internal within sample complexity of individual microbial populations shannon weaver index h and richness were calculated the diversity indexes shannon or simpson index showed that the biodiversity increased from the oxic bioreactor o1 activated sludge hydrolytic reactor activated sludge to the oxic bioreactor o2 activated sludge in accordance with the treatment progress of o h o the bioreactor o1 activated sludge exhibited the lowest bacterial diversity among the three stages due to the high toxicity li et al 2018 which is similar to the first bioreactor o1 of industrial paint wastewater treatment the results also showed that these three cww activated sludge harbored the moderate diversity of bacteria which is more complicated than some extreme environment such as hydrothermal springs wang et al 2013 and acid mine drainage kuang et al 2013 and simple than activated sludge of wwtps ye and zhang 2013 and soil roesch et al 2007 the diversity trend implicated the type and concentration of contaminants in cww determine the bacterial diversity which showed the diversity increased with the biological treatment progress and closer to urban wastewater in terms of water quality 3 3 responses in taxonomic composition of microbial communities in the o h o system rdp classifier was used to assign the effective sequences into different phylogenetic taxa members of bacteria were predominant and made up 99 93 of the classifiable miseq sequencing reads across the 18 subsamples while only a negligible proportion of the sequences 0 07 assigned to archaea were found in hydrolytic reactor h table s1 since reactor h was stirred with n2 gas and the do values in the reactor ranged from 0 to 0 5 mg l 1 it is reasonable to detect minor anaerobic archaea in this stage to disclose the microbial community structure and function in the cww biological treatment process of the reactors o1 h and o2 the classified otus were analyzed at phylum and genus level a total of 34 bacterial phyla including five subphyla in the proteobacteria were identified in the cww activated sludge samples taken from this o h o system from the phylum assignment result it was found that the bacterial diversity in the activated sludge of the o1 h and o2 reactors was significantly different from each other proteobacteria related sequences were the predominant phylum in the full scale cww treatment plant and the relative abundance respectively occupied 78 40 51 43 69 81 in oxic bioreactor o1 hydrolytic reactor h and oxic bioreactor o2 in the oxic bioreactor o1 activated sludge β proteobacteria related sequences were the predominant phylum and over 56 of the sequences were assigned into β proteobacteria α proteobacteria bacteroidetes γ proteobacteria chlorobi actinobacteria planctomycetes and acidobacteria were the subdominant groups each containing 16 03 11 55 5 60 4 79 1 62 1 07 and 1 03 of the detections respectively our previous study showed that firmicutes was the dominant group in the first stage of anaerobic activated sludge zhu et al 2016 but at present study in the first stage of oxic activated sludge firmicutes was not the dominant group and chlorobi appear as the dominant group at the same time the bacteroidetes are always the dominant group in both anaerobic and aerobic condition of the first step of treatment the relative abundance of bacteroidetes in the north subsystem is always higher than the south subsystem in all of the three bioreactors what s more in the predominant phylum of proteobacteria we can see that β proteobacteria instead of γ proteobacteria as the predominant group when we transfer the first step of anaerobic condition to aerobic condition zhu et al 2016 β proteobacteria is largely responsible for organic and nutrient removal cydzik kwiatkowska and zielinska 2016 in the hydrolytic activated sludge from h reactor proteobacteria bacteroidetes chlorobi chloroflexi actinobacteria verrucomicrobia and planctomycetes comprised the dominant phyla compared to the bioreactor o1 activated sludge the relative abundance of proteobacteria distinctly decreased from 78 40 to 51 43 additionally nearly 30 of the sequences in h reactor were assigned into β proteobacteria the bacteroidetes chlorobi and actinobacteria increased during the hydrolytic bioreactor for more than 2 times table s1 it was reported that the major role of the anaerobes bacteroidetes in the fermentation system is to break down macromolecules such as protein starch cellulose and fiber yang et al 2015 particularly the verrucomicrobia increased for more than 10 times in reactor h noteworthily the chloroflexi is prosperous suddenly from 0 24 to 5 56 from reactor o1 to reactor h it was reported that chloroflexi had been identified as one of the core microbial populations in anaerobic digesters and the members of chloroflexi can use halogenated organics as electronic acceptor to biodegrade the chlorocyclohexane and chlorobenzene under the anaerobic sulfate reducing condition chloroflexi and δ proteobacteria members were known to be involved in the fermentative anaerobic metabolism of alkanes and other hydrocarbons and even were connected to methanogenesis through reverse electron transport xia et al 2016 additionally wang et al 2017a 2017b demonstrated that members of chloroflexi were also phenols degraders but it was more likely to be inhibited when exposed to the higher phenol concentration what more high throughput miseq sequencing analyses revealed that the c n ratio was one of the most important factors regulating the microbial community structure and the predominant phylum changed from proteobacteria to chloroflexi with the elevated c n ratio chen et al 2018 based the physico chemical data of phenol and c n it is reasonable for the thriving of chloroflexi in reactor h in the oxic bioreactor o2 activated sludge proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria chlorobi acidobacteria thermi and planctomycetes comprised the dominant phyla β proteobacteria related sequences was the predominant phylum and over 32 of the sequences in the bioreactor o2 activated sludge were assigned into β proteobacteria α proteobacteria bacteroidetes γ proteobacteria chlorobi actinobacteria acidobacteria thermi and planctomycetes were the subdominant groups each containing 27 92 14 46 9 14 3 93 3 48 2 22 1 88 1 54 and 1 51 of the detections respectively compared to the bioreactor o1 and h the thermi increased dramatically table s1 the relative abundance of different phyla varied considerably in o h o activated sludge samples and only planctomycetes keep the constant abundance about 1 10 fig 2 and table s1 some of these phyla were less abundant but widely detected across the subsamples including acidobacteria 0 64 2 28 thermi 0 02 2 03 verrucomicrobia 0 26 2 65 δ proteobacteria 0 13 0 34 and ε proteobacteria 0 03 0 05 rare taxa may gain predominance as a result of environmental perturbations or toxic shock events thus being important for the stable process performance of cww treatment systems gentile et al 2006 zhu et al 2013 interestingly a minor portion nearly 0 2 percent of the classifiable sequences in activated sludge from the h reactor could not be assigned to any bacterial phylum indicating the existence of unknown novel taxa at phylum level contrasting with municipal wwtps nguyen et al 2011 nielsen et al 2010 wan et al 2011 the subphylum β proteobacteria is the most abundance subphylum cross the oho treatment process largely responsible for organic and nutrient removal cydzik kwiatkowska and zielinska 2016 specifically β proteobacteria decreased in the bioreactor h and γ proteobacteria showed an increasing trend especially from the h to o2 which increasing about 3 times it was reported that γ proteobacteria were ubiquitous in wastewater containing nitrate nitrogen and major of the genera in γ proteobacteria have good utilization ability for nitrate nitrogen this is another evidence to support that the major function of o2 is to nitrification with high concentration of nitrate in order to analyze further the dynamic changes of the bacterial community involved in the biological o h o treatment process of cww besides the phylum bacterial diversity and abundance were also analyzed more specifically at genus taxonomic units examination of 397 identified genera further captured the similarities and differences among the microbial communities at the genus level in table s3 in the genus level the bacterial diversity of the bioreactor samples was found dramatically different each other from 69 48 to 83 59 of the total sequences in samples could not be classified indicating a number of taxa remaining unknown major genera relative abundance 1 within a sample from the communities of activated sludge samples from bioreactor o1 bioreactor h and bioreactor o2 were shown in table s2 and fig 3 in the bioreactor o1 thiobacillus rhodoplanes lysobacter and leucobacter comprised the dominant genera each containing 7 53 6 58 1 95 and 1 21 of the detection respectively the genus of thiobacillus can combine denitrification with inorganic sulfur oxidation ma et al 2015 being related to the biodegradation of refractory organic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls adebusoye et al 2007 and dimethylsulfide arellano garcia et al 2009 it was reported that thiobacillus denitrificans could oxidize inorganic sulfur compounds through aerobic respiration or via the denitrification pathway chen et al 2013 and thiobacillus species were also reported dominating in mining wastewater communities schippers et al 2010 the major genera detected in the hydrolytic activated sludge were dominated by rhodoplanes 8 86 followed by t78 2 81 leucobacter 2 35 thiobacillus 2 06 and lysobacter 1 06 compared to o1 the genus of thiobacillus decreased significantly from 7 53 to 2 06 however the genus of rhodoplanes increased from 6 58 to 8 86 as the predominant groups rhodoplanes is the dominant genus in wastewater treatment plants ma et al 2015 and some strains in this genus can grow on organic carbon sources such as acetate pyruvate glucose and fructose srinivas et al 2014 it was reported that kineosporia ensifer and rhodoplanes were core genera in cww treatment plant whereas the occurrence and role of these bacteria were not yet clear ma et al 2015 in this study the genus of t78 burst out from 0 to 2 81 and ranked as the second dominant groups it has been reported that t78 were capable of anaerobic degradation of oil organics including benzene compounds and oil hydrocarbons wang et al 2016 the genus of t78 is known to degrade complex organic compounds using nitrite and nitrate as electron acceptors and was isolated for the first time from a tarn sediment sample xu et al 2018 the hydrolytic unit in real cww treatment process accumulates nitrite and nitrate thus the prosperous of t78 is reasonable additionally the genus of thiobacillus decreased significantly from 7 53 to 2 06 the major genera recovered from the bioreactor o2 activated sludge were dominated by rhodoplanes 8 92 followed by lysobacter 3 61 thiobacillus 3 22 leucobacter 1 91 b 42 1 54 bradyrhizobium 1 49 and hylemonella 1 30 one can see that more genus become the dominant groups and the bacterial diversity also increase with the progress of cww treatment in general the major genera recovered in the activated sludge from bioreactor o2 appeared to be quite different from the o1 and h activated sludge showing the burst out of genus of bradyrhizobium 1 49 and b 42 1 54 members of the genus bradyrhizobium are aerobic microbes and are diverse in biochemical functions such as nitrification sulphur oxidation aromatic degradation hayashi et al 2016 oh et al 2018 sudtachat et al 2009 cleavage the benzene ring of 5 nitroanthranilic acid qu and spain 2010 and degradation vanillate sudtachat et al 2009 bradyrhizobium diazoeffciens formerly classified into b japonicum has a complete set of denitrification genes whereas b japonicum lacks the nos gene cluster and releases n2o as the final product of denitrification delamuta et al 2013 therefore b diazoeffciens and b japonicum share the first three steps of denitrification reduction of no3 to n2o siqueira et al 2017 the major genera analysis revealed the difference in major bacterial groups associated with the cww treatment process t78 belonging to chloroflexi was present in h sludge almost disappeared in o1 and o2 this showed that t78 can be adapted to the hydrolytic condition it was reported that the major genera involved in municipal wastewater treatment plant were zoogloea ferruginibacter and prosthecobacter etc wang et al 2012 compared to municipal wastewater treatment plant the major genera detected in cww were found dramatically different in composition and abundance in addition the recovery of a large number of sequences unclassified at the genus level suggests the knowledge on microbial diversity in the prefix oxic o h o coking wastewater activated sludge still being incomplete due to the little portion of effective sequences can be assigned to genus we further analysis the bacterial structure at family level a total of 242 families were identified and the relative bacterial community abundance of the major family level in the o h o bioreactors shows in table s4 and fig 4 it was found that comamonadaceae related sequences were the predominant family in the full scale cww treatment process nearly half of the effective sequences in aerobic bioreactor o1 belong to the family of comamonadaceae which may contribute to perform the major function in the aerobic bioreactor o1 the relative abundance values of comamonadaceae occupied 47 35 24 81 24 02 in the oxic bioreactor o1 the hydrolysis bioreactor h and the oxic bioreactor o2 respectively it was reported that the family of comamonadeceae are able to biodegrade a wide range of organic compounds zhu et al 2016 and are resistant to the toxic compounds of pahs scn cn phenol etc shi et al 2013 it is reasonable that the comamonadeceae was the predominant group in aerobic bioreactor o1 additionally the members belong to comamonadeceae also proliferated in bioreactor h and o2 which might be responsible for denitrifying and aromatic degrading processes loy et al 2005 and thus promote the biodegradation of pahs and bap for example comamonadeceae sp mq were reported to be capable of dibenzofuran degradation via co metabolism shi et al 2013 these microbial variation at different level indicated that unique operational conditions in each reactor may have shaped their respective microbial community the concentration of tn declined from 500 52 to 20 5 mg l 1with the treatment of progress suggesting a well nitrification denitrification performance the nh3 n concentration decreased from 100 7 mg l 1 in raw water to 4 97 0 53 mg l 1 after o2 stage as we known ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are responsible for nitrification our miseq sequencing results show that nitrosomonadaceae and nitrospiraceae were the dominant ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria during the cww biological treatment process respectively tables s3 and 4 the relative abundance of nitrospira keep constant from 0 30 to 0 36 in all of the three activated sludge while nitrosomonadaceae increased from 0 20 to 2 45 indicating an increasingly stronger nitrite oxidization in the bioreactor o2 the corresponding stable ammonia removal indicated that nitrosomonadaceae was responsible for the efficient ammonia transformation in the biological process of cww treatment the results were consistent with a previous study that nitrosomonadaceae usually dominate aob in cww treatment based on the analysis of 454 pyrosequencing zhu et al 2013 the miseq data showed that nitrospira was the most dominant nob in the biological process of cww treatment and the higher abundance was observed at bioreactor o2 table s3 previous researches reported that nitrobacter was more resistant to toxic compounds than nitrospira blackburne et al 2007 kim et al 2011 2013 qiu et al 2016 due to the high concentration of ammonia and toxic compounds in the cww the rapid growth and dominance of nitrobacter would be favorable for the nitrification process but we got controversial viewpoints in this study that nitrospira was the overwhelming population in the cww activate sludge the rapid growth and dominance of nitrospira would be more favorable for the nitrification process of cww treatment most interesting the phylum of planctomycetes containing the anammox groups keep the constant abundance about 1 10 in all of the three bioreactors table s1 which hint the anammox reaction may also take place in the cww treatment process and contribute to the nitrogen removal 3 4 potential functional profiling the functional microbiota content was predicted from the 16s rrna gene sequence data using picrust software langille et al 2013 a closed reference otu picking strategy was used removing the otus not matching the greengenes 13 5 reference sequences at 97 similarity operational taxonomic units were normalized by dividing their abundances by known or predicted 16s rrna gene copy number abundances before final metagenomic predictions were made predicted functional counts were rarefied to the same depth and relative abundance analyses were calculated by comparing kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg orthologs values levels 1 2 and 3 in all of the cww activated sludge samples the accuracy of metagenome predictions depends on how closely the microbes in a given sample are related to microbes with sequenced genome representatives as measured by the nearest sequenced taxon index nsti with its lower values indicating a closer mean relationship langille et al 2013 the o h o activated sludge samples showed good nsti values of 0 11 0 01 for comparison langille et al 2013 found that human associated samples had the lowest i e the best nsti values of 0 03 0 02 other mammals have a higher number of 0 14 0 06 and diverse communities such as soil inhabitants 0 17 0 02 thus the analyzed cww activated sludge samples provide a data set suitable for examination of picrust predictions in the predicted metagenomes overall 39 of 43 level 2 kegg orthology groups kos were represented the basic metabolism pathways including amino acid 10 67 0 04 carbohydrate 9 80 0 13 and energy 5 28 0 10 metabolisms dominate providing survival of microorganisms fig 5 besides high proportions of gene families involved in replication and repair 6 15 0 08 membrane transport 13 51 0 22 and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism 4 53 0 13 were predicted implying mechanisms of cww degradation and the cww activated sludge adaptation comparing gene functions in o h o activated sludge bacterial communities significant differences oneway anova p 0 05 in membrane transport cell motility and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism was observed fig 5 according to the potential functional profiling xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism functional genes in bioreactor o1 were found to be the highest one the top ten predictive functional genes k00128 k01061 k00074 k01426 k00121 k01821 k10680 k00632 k00480 and k01607 were presumably involved in xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism affiliated with seven important enzyme categories oxidoreductases isomerases lyases transferases decarboxylase hydroxylase and hydrolase were inferred to be involved in xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism pathways correlating to the dominant genera in cww activated sludge the major genera of rhodoplanes lysobacter and leucobacter were predicted to provide the majority of functional genes obviously high cod promoted the growth of phenol and other organic degrading bacteria in cww activated sludge showing activation of membrane transport and xenobiotics degradation these function results further supported the statement that cww exerts certain pressure on microbes in the activated sludge resulting in changed microbial community structure and function 3 5 proposed biodegradation model of cww combining the obtained results including the structure and function of microbiology characteristics of cww operational parameters and relative data from the previous studies chen et al 2019 kong et al 2018 kuang et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2010 zhu et al 2013 2016 we proposed a comprehensive biodegradation model of cww treatment fig 6 which can facilitate the understanding of interactions between water quality operational parameters and microbial structure and function in this model the biological treatment of cww underwent three steps first the treatment took place in oxic condition the major function of aerobic bioreactor o1 is to maintain for highly efficient removal of the readily biodegradable substances such as phenols sulfides and thiocyanate at the same time nearly one quarter of ammonia transfer to nitrate the genera of thiobacillus rhodoplanes lysobacter and leucobacter and related groups were recruited to execute the biodegradation of most phenols sulfides and thiocyanate most interestingly nearly half of the effective sequences belong to the family of comamonadaceae which owns the ability of degrading a wide range of organics under aerobic condition it was reported that comamonas testosteroni strain cnb 1 could grow on phenol and its derivatives as carbon and energy sources ni et al 2013 some species in genera pseudomonas and petrimonas had the capacity of phenol degradation arutchelvan et al 2005 zeng et al 2013 all these bacteria used phenols and its derivatives as energy and materials sources in metabolism krastanov et al 2013 resulting in significant degradation of phenols from 608 to 9 3 mg l 1 thiocyanate is an important contaminant in cww accounting for nearly 15 of the total cod zeng et al 2013 some species in pseudomonas genus can degrade thiocyanate into nh3 n staib and lant 2007 consequently approximately 98 of phenols and 59 of thiocyanate were removed in the first oxic bioreactor o1 indicating successful decarbonization these results indicated that the first oxic bioreactor o1 is the most important biodegradation unit with high cod removal rate 1 42 kg cod m 3day 1 secondly the major function of hydrolytic bioreactor is hydrolytic acidification denitrification and to improve the b c ratio a hydrolytic condition contributes to the hydrolysis of large molecular contaminants into biodegradable small molecular substances it was evidenced by our previous studies that the type and concentration of refractory contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pyridine quinoline and n heterocyclic ring compounds decreased significantly in the h stages and following the increase the ph value xu et al 2015 2018 zhang et al 2012b the genera of rhodoplanes t78 and related groups had the potential to decompose refractory contaminants into readily biodegradable substances thirdly the oxic bioreactor o2 was expected to perform aerobic biotransformation of the remaining refractory organics and nitrification denitrification and was accompanied with further organic carbon degradation the do was set in the range of 2 68 0 23 mg l 1 and the hrt was approximately 20 h the genera of rhodoplanes and some unclarified taxa may contribute to the further inorganic sulfur compound oxidization and nitrification denitrification accompanied with further organic carbon degradation in summary the information gathered in this model not lonely improves our understanding of the complex biodegradation of cww but also has important implications for improving engineering efficiency and reducing the industrial cost in addition further study is needed to evaluate the general applicability of the findings of this study given the biogeographic divergence 4 conclusions in this study we characterized the structure and function of microbial communities in a novel full scale cww treatment o h o system at phylum and genus level the application of the miseq sequencing technique expanded the detection scale of microbial diversity and supplemented previous studies on bacterial community involved in cww treatment system compare to other habitat the microbial populations involved in the novel full scale prefix oxic cww biological treatment o h o system had a moderate microbial diversity but the bacterial diversity increased along the treatment process of o h o with the detoxification progress the diverse and distinct microbial community involved in the novel full scale cww treatment o h o system indicated that the wastewater characteristics and the operational parameters determined the microbial community composition

18574,a novel full scale prefix oxic coking wastewater cww biological treatment o h o system had been operated steadily six years with the effluent quality meeting national discharge standard comparing to the traditional cww biological treatment process which usually have an anaerobic unit at the start of the process here the o h o system has obvious advantages in cod removal total nitrogen removal and reduced energy consumption it is very necessary to illustrate the structure and function of the microbial community involved in different bioreactors of the o h o system high throughput miseq sequencing was used to examine the 16s rrna genes in this system results revealed a contrasting microbial composition among the activated sludge samples of three sequential bioreactors the β proteobacteria related sequences dominated in the o1 activated sludge with the relative abundance of 56 44 while 7 53 of the sequences were assigned to thiobacillus rhodoplanes related sequences dominated in the bioreactor h and o2 activated sludge with relative abundance of 8 86 and 8 92 respectively the physico chemical characteristics of cww were analyzed by standard methods and the operational parameters were routinely monitored to examine their effects on the microbial communities the bioinformatics software package of phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust was used to predict the microbial community functional profiling and found three dominant genera of rhodoplanes lysobacter and leucobacter enriched the xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism pathway the diverse and distinct microbial community involved in biological treatment processes of cww treatment indicating that water characteristics and operational parameters determined the microbial community composition these results significantly expanded our knowledge of the biodiversity and population dynamics of microorganisms and discerned the relationships between bacterial communities and environmental variables in the biological treatment processes moreover in this study we proposed a comprehensive biodegradation model of cww treatment and defined as o h o system graphical abstract image 1 keywords coking wastewater microbiology activated sludge bacterial community 16s rdna 1 introduction the coking wastewater cww is produced in the industrial processes of coal coking gas purification coke recovery coal liquefaction and is a typical abundant industrial organic hard biodegradable wastewater containing refractory pollutant it is the most representative one of coal chemical wastewaters and is typically characterized by complex composition and high toxicity the cww have complex inorganic and organic contaminants and some of them are refractory highly concentrated toxic mutative and carcinogenic such as ammonia phenolic compounds cyanide poly nuclear aromatic hydrocarbons pahs thiocyanide oxygen and sulfur containing heterocyclics and acyclic compounds pan et al 2019 zhang et al 2012b in addition some of priority pollutants have been frequently and persistently detected in cww and sludge systems and pose a potential risk to natural environments and human health negreanu et al 2012 hence the cww is notorious for its toxicity and refractoriness and representing a major challenge to the management of cww treatment coking wastewater treatment is a multi billion dollar industry in the world and cww biological treatment has been applied widely with removing more than 95 of the pollutants vazquez et al 2006 at present traditional activated sludge process is the main step for removing various organic matters which includes a o a a o a o h o a o o sbr and so on the industry generally believes that a a o process is a better process to treat cww but based on the previous studies we found that the first anaerobic unit in the a a o process did not perform biological function well due to the inhibition of methanogenic archaea by high concentration of toxic organic compounds zhu et al 2016 e g zhao et al 2014 found that the influent cod concentration was 1530 mg l 1 and the effluent cod concentration of anaerobic unit of an a o h o process was 1390 mg l 1 sahariah et al 2015 also found that the removal efficiencies of phenol and cod were only 3 and 2 respectively in the anaerobic unit of an a a o process for cww treatment so we designed a novel prefix oxic cww biological treatment o h o system which treat cww with oxic bioreactor 1 o1 firstly and follow by hydrolytic bioreactor h oxic bioreactor 2 o2 as a general abbreviation o h o is used in places we used o1 h o2 to distinguish the first and the second oxic bioreactor where necessary the o h o system had operated steadily six years with the national standard of the discharge quality gb16171 2012 china the function of high load decarburization reaction the reactions of hydrolysis and denitrification complete nitrification and mineralization reactions were performed in the sequential of the designed bioreactors of o1 h o2 respectively comparing to the a a o process the o h o system has significant advantages in cod removal total nitrogen removal and reduced energy consumption the cod concentrations in the secondary effluent of the a a o and o h o process are the range of 200 300 and 150 200 mg l 1 respectively chen et al 2019 kong et al 2018 due to the realization of anammox partial denitrification and other enhanced denitrifications in bioreactor h the effluent concentration of total nitrogen can be lower than 20 mg l 1 in o h o process pan et al 2019 additionally the o h o process also saves energy as compare to the a a o process due to higher oxygen use efficiency and the absence of sludge the hydraulic retention time in the o h o process was only two thirds compare to the a a o process under same effluent concentration of cod the reduced hrt also results in additional energy savings zhou et al 2018 it is very necessary to illustrate the structure and function of the microbial community involved in different bioreactors to give a theoretical evidence of the o h o system the activated sludge technology was used extensively in cww biological treatment processes in which a complex prokaryotic microbial consortium played an important role in the processes of oxygen depleting organics toxics and nutrients removal and preventing discharge of pathogens ye and zhang 2011 despite the environmental and economic importance of the cww treatment the structure and function of microbial community involved in the novel prefix oxic cww treatment o h o system has not yet been precisely characterized and this process remains a black box with limited efficiency bai et al 2011a 2011b zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2010 zhu et al 2013 thus a thorough knowledge of the ecology of the cww activated sludge communities is required to improve o h o system operation and stability therefore there is an increasing interest in revealing the abundance diversity function and distribution of corresponding species present in this o h o coking wastewater activated sludge bai et al 2010 2011b zhu et al 2013 the structure and function of microbial community in cww biological treatment processes have been investigated sporadically using culture independent molecular methods the applications of conventional molecular techniques in the last decades such as terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism t rflp fluorescence in situ hybridization fish denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge 16s rrna clone libraries etc have provided new insights into microbial community composition bai et al 2010 2011b zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2010 in cww biological treatment processes however these methods generally are difficult to detect most of the low abundance members in cww microbial community thus provide incomplete information about the microbial community and diversity within the cww biological treatment system xia et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 the illumina miseq sequencing can generate hundreds of thousands of short sequences and significantly improve researchers ability to investigate the low abundance microorganisms exploring these previously undetected rare taxa is critical since they may play an important role in resistance and resilience of the community and in the stability of the microbial ecosystem liang et al 2014 shade et al 2012 qiu et al 2019 the advent of high throughput sequencing technology now affords new opportunities to address these knowledge gaps by comprehensively characterizing microbial communities in the biological process of cww treatment system and to examine the relationships between microbial communities and environmental variables in cww treatment to our knowledge there have been no molecular microbial diversity surveys of the novel full scale prefix oxic cww treatment system and unit variations of these diverse communities in relation to process performance remain little known ha et al 2012 silva et al 2012 in this study a taxonomic and functional metagenomics approach was used to analyze the structure and function of microbial community associated with the novel full scale prefix oxic cww treatment system composed of three sequential bioreactors oxic 1 hydrolytic oxic 2 o1 h o2 utilizing three phase fluidized bed technology the contaminants removal efficiency was measured and operating parameters were monitored during the long term stable operation illumina miseq high throughput sequencing was performed to reveal the relative abundance and diversity of microbiology in bioreactor o1 h and o2 an exploratory bioinformatics tool phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust was used to predict the cww activated sludge community function based on 16s rrna genes information the objectives of this study include 1 revelation of variations in the microbiological abundance diversity and function in the cww activated sludge samples from the o h o reactors chain 2 identification of the dominant microbial community responsible for the cww treatment and presume the biodegradation potential of dominant bacterial genera in the corresponding bioreactor 3 to discerned the relationships between bacterial communities and environmental variables in the novel o h o biological processes of full scale cww treatment system to the best of our knowledge this study describes the first effort to reveal the structure and function of microbial community involved in the novel industrial scale prefix oxic cww treatment o h o system which could be used to monitor cww activated sludge s biodegradation ability for organic pollutants and to evaluate cww treatment efficiency 2 methods and materials 2 1 full scale o h o cww treatment system and sample collection a novel full scale prefix oxic cww treatment system an on going three phase fluidized bed biological cww treatment system in tianjin iron and steel corporation shexian hebei province of china was studied the raw cww passed the primary treatment stage comprised of oil separation ammonia stripping and ph equalization being further directed to the sequential biological treatment the biological treatment processes is comprised of three fluidized bed reactors oxic bioreactor 1 o1 hydrolytic bioreactor h oxic bioreactor 2 o2 biological treatment is followed by the advanced treatment stage including coagulation with subsequent sedimentation and ozonation fig 1 the final effluent meets the national standard of the discharge quality gb16171 2012 china in order to release the accidental event shock this system has two serial of parallel bioreactors dependently which named south and north subsystem respectively this system has been operating for 6 years at daily capacity of approximately 2400 160 m3 of cww the total hydraulic retention time hrt of the biological o h o system was 98 11 h this system was able to maintain a stable process performance during operation the cww activated sludge samples were collected from the corresponding south and north bioreactors in may 2018 mixed liquor was sampled in triplicate from individual cww treatment unit including the bioreactor o1 bioreactor h and bioreactor o2 all samples were kept in cooler boxes during sampling and transportation to the laboratory aliquots 2 3 ml of each sample were centrifuged at 12 000 g for 10 min 4 c the cell pellets were rinsed twice with sodium phosphate buffer 120 mm ph 8 0 and stored at 20 c prior to dna extraction 2 2 characteristics of coking wastewater the collected cww samples were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 3 min and the supernatants were analyzed for the chemical oxidation demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss analyzed according to the standard spectrophotometric methods the contents of ammonium phenol sulfides s2 thiocyanate scn and total nitrogen tn were analyzed by the colorimetric method with a spectrophotometer genesys tm 5 spectronic inc usa after distillation the cyanides cn concentration was determined by the pyridine pyrazolone method the total organic carbon toc measured using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph japan the contents of pahs were analyzed using a gc ms 7890a 5975c agilent usa with a 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm film thickness hp 5ms column in selected ion mode the do concentration was measured using a do meter cellox 3310i wtw germany and the ph was monitored with a ph meter phs 3d shanghai the design of biological reactor directly influenced the reaction efficiency and microbial population in order to deal with high cod load rate 2 03 kg cod m3d an internal loop multiphase airlift fluidized bed reactor was developed by the authors wei et al 2000 and applied in the current system the internal loop design ensured the efficient mixing and mass transfer with low energy consumption zhang et al 2012a temperatures for the three bioreactors were relatively constant between 19 and 23 c in the long term performance table 1 the average ph of the bioreactor o1 h and o2 were maintained at 7 15 7 09 and 7 01 respectively the dissolved oxygen do concentration in the bioreactor h was maintained in the range of 0 3 0 46 mg l 1 while the do level of the other two aerobic bioreactors were maintained in the range between 2 37 2 99 and 3 15 3 37 mg l 1 respectively the hydraulic retention time hrt of the bioreactor o1 h and o2 were 60 8 18 3 20 4 h respectively the sludge retention times srts of the bioreactor o1 h and o2 were 8 2 33 5 18 3 days respectively this long srt was beneficial for the generation and evolution of specific functional microorganism species such as anammox ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob the concentrations of activated sludge varied across the range of 2590 4920 mg l 1 over the course of the operation the srt was controlled by removal of excess sludge resulting in different mlss concentrations in the biological treatment processes the operational parameters e g do mlss srt etc can be regulated to optimize the performance detailed operational information of the novel full scale prefix oxic cww treatment system was given in table 1 as reflected by the cww quality the microbial community in different bioreactor kept adjusting to the wastewater characteristic and operation conditions 2 3 dna extraction microbial genomic dna was extracted using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio usa according to the manufacturer s protocol dna quality was assessed by the ratios of 260 280 nm and 260 230 nm absorption measured by an nd 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa and agarose gel electrophoresis 2 4 pcr amplification and barcoded miseq sequencing of 16s rrna genes the v4 hypervariable region of 16s rrna gene was pcr amplified triplicate reactions for each sample using primers f515 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and r806 5 ggactacvsgggtatctaat 3 following the procedures described by zhu et al 2016 this primer set has been demonstrated in silico to be universal for nearly all bacterial and archaeal taxa an 8 bp error correcting tag was added to the forward primer replicate amplicons of each sample were pooled and purified using a qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen a single composite dna sample for miseq sequencing was prepared by combining approximately equimolar amount of purified pcr products from each sludge sample the sequences have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive under the accession number srr9651087 srr9651104 2 5 miseq sequencing and sequence analysis the composition of the pcr products of v4 region of 16s rrna genes was determined by miseq sequencing samples in this study were individually barcoded to enable multiplex sequencing after miseq sequencing the raw data were processed and analyzed following the pipelines of mothur and qiime raw data were denoised using the mothur implementation of pyronoise algorithm chimeric sequences were identified and removed using uchime edgar et al 2011 quality sequences were assigned to samples according to their unique 8 bp barcodes operational taxonomic units otus defined at the 97 sequence similarity level were picked using average neighbor method after the needleman alignment and a single linkage precluster procedure taxonomy classification was identified using rdp classifier at the 80 confidence threshold by default alpha number of otus chao 1 and simpson and shannon indices diversity were statistically analyzed via rarefaction with all data sets normalized to 11 131 reads the minimum number of effective sequences generated for the 18 activated sludge subsamples per subsample good s coverage estimators representing the subsample coverage were calculated using the mothur software to explore the functional profiles of the bacterial community data set a bioinformatics tool predicting gene family abundances was used based on 16s gene surveys given a database of phylogenetically referenced genomes picrust langille et al 2013 this analysis was derived from observation of association between phylogeny and gene content for the analysis otus were closed reference picked against the 18 may 2012 greengenes database using qiime v 1 7 according to the online protocol the resulting data set was rarefied at 11 131 16s rrna sequences per sample these data were used to assess the difference between gene functions of the sequential cww activated sludge bacteria 2 6 principal component analysis the description of multiple parameters might become verbose and confusing in order to extract the dominating parameter set in biological treatment processes of o h o system the pca was conducted the environmental parameters included the characteristics of cww and operational parameters such as cod phenols cyanides thiocyanate ammonia do sulfides etc variances were first normalized into an interval of 2 2 using standardizing program that embedded in spss 19 0 statistical software ibm usa the pca of normalized data set was conducted using spss 19 0 followed the similar processes in our previous studies ou et al 2014 3 results discussion 3 1 o h o performance functional stability of the o h o system was defined and quantified by the concentration of 14 cww indicators which include cod bod phenols cyanides thiocyanate ammonia tn tp tss toc sulfides oil pahs and bap table 2 shows the concentration range of the indictors in the operating bioreactor the cod removal during the operation period was approximately 97 4 with the average cod concentrations in the raw water bioreactor o1 bioreactor h bioreactor o2 and biological effluent at 5451 612 520 193 and 140 mg l 1 respectively compared to a a o process the cod concentration of the secondary effluent of o h o process is always lower about 30 mg l 1 and the removal rate of refractory components was promoted by about 2 5 in the o h o system the main reasons were that most biodegradable compounds were degraded in the o1 unit and the residual refractory organics were hydrolyzed in the following h unit to improve the b c ratio for further aerobic removal in reactor o2 so the removal rates of refractory components were higher than these in the a a o process without hydrolysis this was evidenced by the pahs concentration in the secondary effluent of the o h o system 38 50 μg l which is lower than these in the a a o process 52 66 μg l kong et al 2018 zhang et al 2012b the phenols removal efficiency was approximately 99 5 in the prefix oxic bioreactor o1 cyanides were proven to be toxic to microorganisms kim et al 2013 luque almagro et al 2018 and nearly 97 3 of cyanides were removed firstly in the unit o1 the major function of h unit is denitrogen hydrolysis and to improve the b c ratio from 0 10 to 0 25 the cod in reactor h showed only a minor decrease from 612 to 520 mg l 1 and the bod increase from 69 to 108 mg l 1 due to hydrolysis after the unit of bioreactor o2 the ammonium removal in the biological effluent from o2 reached nearly 99 0 as shown in table 2 indicating the good performance of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and even anammox in the biological o h o process of cww treatment almost all scn which varied from 522 to 662 mg l 1 in the raw water was completely removed after the oxic bioreactor o2 this is consistent with kim s result that scn is aerobically degraded to a combination of ammonia carbonate and sulfate by several species of genus of thiobacillus which uses scn as a carbon and nitrogen source kim et al 2011 the concentration of sulfides in raw water was 150 7 mg l 1 it rapidly decreased to 0 21 0 12 mg l 1 after o2 stage with removal efficiency of 99 8 these results showed that the o h o system yielded stable contaminants removal efficiency with satisfactory performance and an interesting phenomenon was found that more than 90 of cod includes phenol cyanide thiocyanate etc were decomposed in the first oxic bioreactor by distinct bacteria in the following we would try to illustrate the structure and function of microbial community involved in different bioreactors in the o h o system 3 2 phylogenetic diversity analysis of sequences we used miseq sequencing to analyze the bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna genes across the 18 activated subsamples from three bioreactors of the o h o system a total of 384 459 effective sequences and 7745 otus were retrieved from the activated sludge samples 11 381 27 505 effective sequences were yielded for each subsample table 3 rdp classifier was used to assign these sequences into different otu with 3 of nucleotide cutoff the average of 617 767 and 801 otus were identified for the activated sludge samples of bioreactors o1 h and o2 according to a subset of 11131 randomly selected sequences respectively the otus numbers detected in the sludge of the o h o system are significantly smaller than observed in wwtps ye and zhang 2013 similarly to the previous studies on cww and other industrial wastewaters figuerola and erijman 2007 zhu et al 2013 the statistical analysis and rarefaction curves summarizing the otus clustered from these miseq sequencing reads are showed in table 3 and fig s1 respectively good s coverage revealed that the results represented the majority of bacterial 16s rrna sequences present in each subsample with values ranging from 95 8 to 97 6 to assess the internal within sample complexity of individual microbial populations shannon weaver index h and richness were calculated the diversity indexes shannon or simpson index showed that the biodiversity increased from the oxic bioreactor o1 activated sludge hydrolytic reactor activated sludge to the oxic bioreactor o2 activated sludge in accordance with the treatment progress of o h o the bioreactor o1 activated sludge exhibited the lowest bacterial diversity among the three stages due to the high toxicity li et al 2018 which is similar to the first bioreactor o1 of industrial paint wastewater treatment the results also showed that these three cww activated sludge harbored the moderate diversity of bacteria which is more complicated than some extreme environment such as hydrothermal springs wang et al 2013 and acid mine drainage kuang et al 2013 and simple than activated sludge of wwtps ye and zhang 2013 and soil roesch et al 2007 the diversity trend implicated the type and concentration of contaminants in cww determine the bacterial diversity which showed the diversity increased with the biological treatment progress and closer to urban wastewater in terms of water quality 3 3 responses in taxonomic composition of microbial communities in the o h o system rdp classifier was used to assign the effective sequences into different phylogenetic taxa members of bacteria were predominant and made up 99 93 of the classifiable miseq sequencing reads across the 18 subsamples while only a negligible proportion of the sequences 0 07 assigned to archaea were found in hydrolytic reactor h table s1 since reactor h was stirred with n2 gas and the do values in the reactor ranged from 0 to 0 5 mg l 1 it is reasonable to detect minor anaerobic archaea in this stage to disclose the microbial community structure and function in the cww biological treatment process of the reactors o1 h and o2 the classified otus were analyzed at phylum and genus level a total of 34 bacterial phyla including five subphyla in the proteobacteria were identified in the cww activated sludge samples taken from this o h o system from the phylum assignment result it was found that the bacterial diversity in the activated sludge of the o1 h and o2 reactors was significantly different from each other proteobacteria related sequences were the predominant phylum in the full scale cww treatment plant and the relative abundance respectively occupied 78 40 51 43 69 81 in oxic bioreactor o1 hydrolytic reactor h and oxic bioreactor o2 in the oxic bioreactor o1 activated sludge β proteobacteria related sequences were the predominant phylum and over 56 of the sequences were assigned into β proteobacteria α proteobacteria bacteroidetes γ proteobacteria chlorobi actinobacteria planctomycetes and acidobacteria were the subdominant groups each containing 16 03 11 55 5 60 4 79 1 62 1 07 and 1 03 of the detections respectively our previous study showed that firmicutes was the dominant group in the first stage of anaerobic activated sludge zhu et al 2016 but at present study in the first stage of oxic activated sludge firmicutes was not the dominant group and chlorobi appear as the dominant group at the same time the bacteroidetes are always the dominant group in both anaerobic and aerobic condition of the first step of treatment the relative abundance of bacteroidetes in the north subsystem is always higher than the south subsystem in all of the three bioreactors what s more in the predominant phylum of proteobacteria we can see that β proteobacteria instead of γ proteobacteria as the predominant group when we transfer the first step of anaerobic condition to aerobic condition zhu et al 2016 β proteobacteria is largely responsible for organic and nutrient removal cydzik kwiatkowska and zielinska 2016 in the hydrolytic activated sludge from h reactor proteobacteria bacteroidetes chlorobi chloroflexi actinobacteria verrucomicrobia and planctomycetes comprised the dominant phyla compared to the bioreactor o1 activated sludge the relative abundance of proteobacteria distinctly decreased from 78 40 to 51 43 additionally nearly 30 of the sequences in h reactor were assigned into β proteobacteria the bacteroidetes chlorobi and actinobacteria increased during the hydrolytic bioreactor for more than 2 times table s1 it was reported that the major role of the anaerobes bacteroidetes in the fermentation system is to break down macromolecules such as protein starch cellulose and fiber yang et al 2015 particularly the verrucomicrobia increased for more than 10 times in reactor h noteworthily the chloroflexi is prosperous suddenly from 0 24 to 5 56 from reactor o1 to reactor h it was reported that chloroflexi had been identified as one of the core microbial populations in anaerobic digesters and the members of chloroflexi can use halogenated organics as electronic acceptor to biodegrade the chlorocyclohexane and chlorobenzene under the anaerobic sulfate reducing condition chloroflexi and δ proteobacteria members were known to be involved in the fermentative anaerobic metabolism of alkanes and other hydrocarbons and even were connected to methanogenesis through reverse electron transport xia et al 2016 additionally wang et al 2017a 2017b demonstrated that members of chloroflexi were also phenols degraders but it was more likely to be inhibited when exposed to the higher phenol concentration what more high throughput miseq sequencing analyses revealed that the c n ratio was one of the most important factors regulating the microbial community structure and the predominant phylum changed from proteobacteria to chloroflexi with the elevated c n ratio chen et al 2018 based the physico chemical data of phenol and c n it is reasonable for the thriving of chloroflexi in reactor h in the oxic bioreactor o2 activated sludge proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria chlorobi acidobacteria thermi and planctomycetes comprised the dominant phyla β proteobacteria related sequences was the predominant phylum and over 32 of the sequences in the bioreactor o2 activated sludge were assigned into β proteobacteria α proteobacteria bacteroidetes γ proteobacteria chlorobi actinobacteria acidobacteria thermi and planctomycetes were the subdominant groups each containing 27 92 14 46 9 14 3 93 3 48 2 22 1 88 1 54 and 1 51 of the detections respectively compared to the bioreactor o1 and h the thermi increased dramatically table s1 the relative abundance of different phyla varied considerably in o h o activated sludge samples and only planctomycetes keep the constant abundance about 1 10 fig 2 and table s1 some of these phyla were less abundant but widely detected across the subsamples including acidobacteria 0 64 2 28 thermi 0 02 2 03 verrucomicrobia 0 26 2 65 δ proteobacteria 0 13 0 34 and ε proteobacteria 0 03 0 05 rare taxa may gain predominance as a result of environmental perturbations or toxic shock events thus being important for the stable process performance of cww treatment systems gentile et al 2006 zhu et al 2013 interestingly a minor portion nearly 0 2 percent of the classifiable sequences in activated sludge from the h reactor could not be assigned to any bacterial phylum indicating the existence of unknown novel taxa at phylum level contrasting with municipal wwtps nguyen et al 2011 nielsen et al 2010 wan et al 2011 the subphylum β proteobacteria is the most abundance subphylum cross the oho treatment process largely responsible for organic and nutrient removal cydzik kwiatkowska and zielinska 2016 specifically β proteobacteria decreased in the bioreactor h and γ proteobacteria showed an increasing trend especially from the h to o2 which increasing about 3 times it was reported that γ proteobacteria were ubiquitous in wastewater containing nitrate nitrogen and major of the genera in γ proteobacteria have good utilization ability for nitrate nitrogen this is another evidence to support that the major function of o2 is to nitrification with high concentration of nitrate in order to analyze further the dynamic changes of the bacterial community involved in the biological o h o treatment process of cww besides the phylum bacterial diversity and abundance were also analyzed more specifically at genus taxonomic units examination of 397 identified genera further captured the similarities and differences among the microbial communities at the genus level in table s3 in the genus level the bacterial diversity of the bioreactor samples was found dramatically different each other from 69 48 to 83 59 of the total sequences in samples could not be classified indicating a number of taxa remaining unknown major genera relative abundance 1 within a sample from the communities of activated sludge samples from bioreactor o1 bioreactor h and bioreactor o2 were shown in table s2 and fig 3 in the bioreactor o1 thiobacillus rhodoplanes lysobacter and leucobacter comprised the dominant genera each containing 7 53 6 58 1 95 and 1 21 of the detection respectively the genus of thiobacillus can combine denitrification with inorganic sulfur oxidation ma et al 2015 being related to the biodegradation of refractory organic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls adebusoye et al 2007 and dimethylsulfide arellano garcia et al 2009 it was reported that thiobacillus denitrificans could oxidize inorganic sulfur compounds through aerobic respiration or via the denitrification pathway chen et al 2013 and thiobacillus species were also reported dominating in mining wastewater communities schippers et al 2010 the major genera detected in the hydrolytic activated sludge were dominated by rhodoplanes 8 86 followed by t78 2 81 leucobacter 2 35 thiobacillus 2 06 and lysobacter 1 06 compared to o1 the genus of thiobacillus decreased significantly from 7 53 to 2 06 however the genus of rhodoplanes increased from 6 58 to 8 86 as the predominant groups rhodoplanes is the dominant genus in wastewater treatment plants ma et al 2015 and some strains in this genus can grow on organic carbon sources such as acetate pyruvate glucose and fructose srinivas et al 2014 it was reported that kineosporia ensifer and rhodoplanes were core genera in cww treatment plant whereas the occurrence and role of these bacteria were not yet clear ma et al 2015 in this study the genus of t78 burst out from 0 to 2 81 and ranked as the second dominant groups it has been reported that t78 were capable of anaerobic degradation of oil organics including benzene compounds and oil hydrocarbons wang et al 2016 the genus of t78 is known to degrade complex organic compounds using nitrite and nitrate as electron acceptors and was isolated for the first time from a tarn sediment sample xu et al 2018 the hydrolytic unit in real cww treatment process accumulates nitrite and nitrate thus the prosperous of t78 is reasonable additionally the genus of thiobacillus decreased significantly from 7 53 to 2 06 the major genera recovered from the bioreactor o2 activated sludge were dominated by rhodoplanes 8 92 followed by lysobacter 3 61 thiobacillus 3 22 leucobacter 1 91 b 42 1 54 bradyrhizobium 1 49 and hylemonella 1 30 one can see that more genus become the dominant groups and the bacterial diversity also increase with the progress of cww treatment in general the major genera recovered in the activated sludge from bioreactor o2 appeared to be quite different from the o1 and h activated sludge showing the burst out of genus of bradyrhizobium 1 49 and b 42 1 54 members of the genus bradyrhizobium are aerobic microbes and are diverse in biochemical functions such as nitrification sulphur oxidation aromatic degradation hayashi et al 2016 oh et al 2018 sudtachat et al 2009 cleavage the benzene ring of 5 nitroanthranilic acid qu and spain 2010 and degradation vanillate sudtachat et al 2009 bradyrhizobium diazoeffciens formerly classified into b japonicum has a complete set of denitrification genes whereas b japonicum lacks the nos gene cluster and releases n2o as the final product of denitrification delamuta et al 2013 therefore b diazoeffciens and b japonicum share the first three steps of denitrification reduction of no3 to n2o siqueira et al 2017 the major genera analysis revealed the difference in major bacterial groups associated with the cww treatment process t78 belonging to chloroflexi was present in h sludge almost disappeared in o1 and o2 this showed that t78 can be adapted to the hydrolytic condition it was reported that the major genera involved in municipal wastewater treatment plant were zoogloea ferruginibacter and prosthecobacter etc wang et al 2012 compared to municipal wastewater treatment plant the major genera detected in cww were found dramatically different in composition and abundance in addition the recovery of a large number of sequences unclassified at the genus level suggests the knowledge on microbial diversity in the prefix oxic o h o coking wastewater activated sludge still being incomplete due to the little portion of effective sequences can be assigned to genus we further analysis the bacterial structure at family level a total of 242 families were identified and the relative bacterial community abundance of the major family level in the o h o bioreactors shows in table s4 and fig 4 it was found that comamonadaceae related sequences were the predominant family in the full scale cww treatment process nearly half of the effective sequences in aerobic bioreactor o1 belong to the family of comamonadaceae which may contribute to perform the major function in the aerobic bioreactor o1 the relative abundance values of comamonadaceae occupied 47 35 24 81 24 02 in the oxic bioreactor o1 the hydrolysis bioreactor h and the oxic bioreactor o2 respectively it was reported that the family of comamonadeceae are able to biodegrade a wide range of organic compounds zhu et al 2016 and are resistant to the toxic compounds of pahs scn cn phenol etc shi et al 2013 it is reasonable that the comamonadeceae was the predominant group in aerobic bioreactor o1 additionally the members belong to comamonadeceae also proliferated in bioreactor h and o2 which might be responsible for denitrifying and aromatic degrading processes loy et al 2005 and thus promote the biodegradation of pahs and bap for example comamonadeceae sp mq were reported to be capable of dibenzofuran degradation via co metabolism shi et al 2013 these microbial variation at different level indicated that unique operational conditions in each reactor may have shaped their respective microbial community the concentration of tn declined from 500 52 to 20 5 mg l 1with the treatment of progress suggesting a well nitrification denitrification performance the nh3 n concentration decreased from 100 7 mg l 1 in raw water to 4 97 0 53 mg l 1 after o2 stage as we known ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are responsible for nitrification our miseq sequencing results show that nitrosomonadaceae and nitrospiraceae were the dominant ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria during the cww biological treatment process respectively tables s3 and 4 the relative abundance of nitrospira keep constant from 0 30 to 0 36 in all of the three activated sludge while nitrosomonadaceae increased from 0 20 to 2 45 indicating an increasingly stronger nitrite oxidization in the bioreactor o2 the corresponding stable ammonia removal indicated that nitrosomonadaceae was responsible for the efficient ammonia transformation in the biological process of cww treatment the results were consistent with a previous study that nitrosomonadaceae usually dominate aob in cww treatment based on the analysis of 454 pyrosequencing zhu et al 2013 the miseq data showed that nitrospira was the most dominant nob in the biological process of cww treatment and the higher abundance was observed at bioreactor o2 table s3 previous researches reported that nitrobacter was more resistant to toxic compounds than nitrospira blackburne et al 2007 kim et al 2011 2013 qiu et al 2016 due to the high concentration of ammonia and toxic compounds in the cww the rapid growth and dominance of nitrobacter would be favorable for the nitrification process but we got controversial viewpoints in this study that nitrospira was the overwhelming population in the cww activate sludge the rapid growth and dominance of nitrospira would be more favorable for the nitrification process of cww treatment most interesting the phylum of planctomycetes containing the anammox groups keep the constant abundance about 1 10 in all of the three bioreactors table s1 which hint the anammox reaction may also take place in the cww treatment process and contribute to the nitrogen removal 3 4 potential functional profiling the functional microbiota content was predicted from the 16s rrna gene sequence data using picrust software langille et al 2013 a closed reference otu picking strategy was used removing the otus not matching the greengenes 13 5 reference sequences at 97 similarity operational taxonomic units were normalized by dividing their abundances by known or predicted 16s rrna gene copy number abundances before final metagenomic predictions were made predicted functional counts were rarefied to the same depth and relative abundance analyses were calculated by comparing kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg orthologs values levels 1 2 and 3 in all of the cww activated sludge samples the accuracy of metagenome predictions depends on how closely the microbes in a given sample are related to microbes with sequenced genome representatives as measured by the nearest sequenced taxon index nsti with its lower values indicating a closer mean relationship langille et al 2013 the o h o activated sludge samples showed good nsti values of 0 11 0 01 for comparison langille et al 2013 found that human associated samples had the lowest i e the best nsti values of 0 03 0 02 other mammals have a higher number of 0 14 0 06 and diverse communities such as soil inhabitants 0 17 0 02 thus the analyzed cww activated sludge samples provide a data set suitable for examination of picrust predictions in the predicted metagenomes overall 39 of 43 level 2 kegg orthology groups kos were represented the basic metabolism pathways including amino acid 10 67 0 04 carbohydrate 9 80 0

0 22 and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism 4 53 0 13 were predicted implying mechanisms of cww degradation and the cww activated sludge adaptation comparing gene functions in o h o activated sludge bacterial communities significant differences oneway anova p 0 05 in membrane transport cell motility and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism was observed fig 5 according to the potential functional profiling xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism functional genes in bioreactor o1 were found to be the highest one the top ten predictive functional genes k00128 k01061 k00074 k01426 k00121 k01821 k10680 k00632 k00480 and k01607 were presumably involved in xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism affiliated with seven important enzyme categories oxidoreductases isomerases lyases transferases decarboxylase hydroxylase and hydrolase were inferred to be involved in xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism pathways correlating to the dominant genera in cww activated sludge the major genera of rhodoplanes lysobacter and leucobacter were predicted to provide the majority of functional genes obviously high cod promoted the growth of phenol and other organic degrading bacteria in cww activated sludge showing activation of membrane transport and xenobiotics degradation these function results further supported the statement that cww exerts certain pressure on microbes in the activated sludge resulting in changed microbial community structure and function 3 5 proposed biodegradation model of cww combining the obtained results including the structure and function of microbiology characteristics of cww operational parameters and relative data from the previous studies chen et al 2019 kong et al 2018 kuang et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2010 zhu et al 2013 2016 we proposed a comprehensive biodegradation model of cww treatment fig 6 which can facilitate the understanding of interactions between water quality operational parameters and microbial structure and function in this model the biological treatment of cww underwent three steps first the treatment took place in oxic condition the major function of aerobic bioreactor o1 is to maintain for highly efficient removal of the readily biodegradable substances such as phenols sulfides and thiocyanate at the same time nearly one quarter of ammonia transfer to nitrate the genera of thiobacillus rhodoplanes lysobacter and leucobacter and related groups were recruited to execute the biodegradation of most phenols sulfides and thiocyanate most interestingly nearly half of the effective sequences belong to the family of comamonadaceae which owns the ability of degrading a wide range of organics under aerobic condition it was reported that comamonas testosteroni strain cnb 1 could grow on phenol and its derivatives as carbon and energy sources ni et al 2013 some species in genera pseudomonas and petrimonas had the capacity of phenol degradation arutchelvan et al 2005 zeng et al 2013 all these bacteria used phenols and its derivatives as energy and materials sources in metabolism krastanov et al 2013 resulting in significant degradation of phenols from 608 to 9 3 mg l 1 thiocyanate is an important contaminant in cww accounting for nearly 15 of the total cod zeng et al 2013 some species in pseudomonas genus can degrade thiocyanate into nh3 n staib and lant 2007 consequently approximately 98 of phenols and 59 of thiocyanate were removed in the first oxic bioreactor o1 indicating successful decarbonization these results indicated that the first oxic bioreactor o1 is the most important biodegradation unit with high cod removal rate 1 42 kg cod m 3day 1 secondly the major function of hydrolytic bioreactor is hydrolytic acidification denitrification and to improve the b c ratio a hydrolytic condition contributes to the hydrolysis of large molecular contaminants into biodegradable small molecular substances it was evidenced by our previous studies that the type and concentration of refractory contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pyridine quinoline and n heterocyclic ring compounds decreased significantly in the h stages and following the increase the ph value xu et al 2015 2018 zhang et al 2012b the genera of rhodoplanes t78 and related groups had the potential to decompose refractory contaminants into readily biodegradable substances thirdly the oxic bioreactor o2 was expected to perform aerobic biotransformation of the remaining refractory organics and nitrification denitrification and was accompanied with further organic carbon degradation the do was set in the range of 2 68 0 23 mg l 1 and the hrt was approximately 20 h the genera of rhodoplanes and some unclarified taxa may contribute to the further inorganic sulfur compound oxidization and nitrification denitrification accompanied with further organic carbon degradation in summary the information gathered in this model not lonely improves our understanding of the complex biodegradation of cww but also has important implications for improving engineering efficiency and reducing the industrial cost in addition further study is needed to evaluate the general applicability of the findings of this study given the biogeographic divergence 4 conclusions in this study we characterized the structure and function of microbial communities in a novel full scale cww treatment o h o system at phylum and genus level the application of the miseq sequencing technique expanded the detection scale of microbial diversity and supplemented previous studies on bacterial community involved in cww treatment system compare to other habitat the microbial populations involved in the novel full scale prefix oxic cww biological treatment o h o system had a moderate microbial diversity but the bacterial diversity increased along the treatment process of o h o with the detoxification progress the diverse and distinct microbial community involved in the novel full scale cww treatment o h o system indicated that the wastewater characteristics and the operational parameters determined the microbial community composition additionally based on the data from microbiology and environmental factors we proposed a comprehensive biodegradation model of cww treatment an in depth investigation and understanding of the nexus among the diversity of pollutants in the wastewater the spatial and temporal distributions of microbial community structure and functions and the system operational conditions would benefit the
