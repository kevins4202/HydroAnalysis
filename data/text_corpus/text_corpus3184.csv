15920,in the earth s critical zone water plays an essential role as a collector and transporter of metabolites and their transformation products it is generally believed that the chemical profiles of groundwater are strongly impacted by land use however predictors for the effects of above ground natural and anthropogenic activities on below ground chemistry are rare we reasoned that comparing groundwater metabolomes from different land use sites and depths can give insight into this coupling of above and below ground processes in the critical zone this study used an lc ms based untargeted metabolomic approach to identify links between groundwater metabolomes from monitoring wells in fractured carbonate siliciclastic alternations along a hillslope of the hainich critical zone exploratory cze in thuringia germany our results identify the land use type aquifer system and sampling depth as critical factors determining the differences among groundwater metabolomes we established five groundwater metabolic clusters and correlated these to the aquifer systems hydrogeochemistry and microbial community composition our untargeted metabolomic approach reveals the limited connectivity of groundwater chemical profiles with above ground activities and illustrates how deep the input signals can travel graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords earth s critical zone untargeted metabolomics groundwater metabolomics lc ms aquifers 1 introduction earth s critical zone cz is the heterogeneous section of our planet that encompasses the canopy of trees down to the bedrock including the associated groundwater from the aquifers lin 2010 it is undeniably critical because all processes that sustain life occur in this zone and it is severely affected by anthropogenic activities burri et al 2019 the cz comprises complex processes originating with rainwater as the main factor in renewing groundwater systems during the infiltration through the soil the seepage water compiles air dissolved organic matter dom guggenberger and kaiser 2003 other earth materials gleixner 2013 schrumpf et al 2013 and biota brantley et al 2007 dibbern et al 2014 biogeochemical processes along the path of seepage water determine aquifers hydrogeochemical and microbiological composition canora et al 2008 urich and conservation 2002 microbial transformation processes determine the metabolic diversity along the passage of seepage water and aquifer assemblages recent evidence suggests that soil microbial diversity can explain at least 25 of the variability of dom in the cz but over 40 of its variation is still unexplained roth et al 2019 the unexplained variation of dom can be caused by plant derived compounds which depend on plant composition and diversity above ground einsiedl et al 2007 gleixner 2013 gleixner et al 2002 kaiser and kalbitz 2012 other findings indicate that microbial communities and their enzymatic activities adapt to depth variations of the dom composition leinemann et al 2018 and along the land use slope kamjunke et al 2019 and thereby affect the chemical inventory in various ways groundwater microbial diversity is crucially connected with the chemical environment and evolves with the availability of dissolved organic carbon guo et al 2019 therefore a microbial selection of the chemical environment may also influence community diversity in groundwater yan et al 2020 consecutively new metabolomic conditions along the seepage water passage may be established above ground anthropogenic activities like agriculture are a threat to cz balance the human impact over large above ground areas generates critical changes in the geology of the cz vitousek et al 1997 wilkinson and mcelroy 2007 land use can also condition the enzyme activities in rhizosphere soil tischer et al 2019 and seepage water will carry the new products down to the groundwater changing microbial composition consequently above ground activity and changes in land cover will impact not only the groundwater recharge canora et al 2008 scanlon et al 2005 or the storage prabhakar and tiwari 2015 but also the resources and quality denizman 2018 fianko et al 2009 khan et al 2017 lerner and harris 2009 priyantha ranjan et al 2006 the effects of anthropogenic processes have also been identified in complex aquifer assemblies in a long term study sheikhy narany et al 2018 indicating that groundwater reservoirs are always affected by the intense exploitation of the land agriculture and pasture practices are among the principal human activities impacting groundwater organic pollutants op originating from those activities are also found in groundwater and have gained substantial interest edwards et al 2019 schmidt 2018 trček et al 2018 herbicides for example get incorporated into the soils and are transformed there into new compounds that become part of the aquifers walker and brown 1985 likewise some veterinarian drugs have been found in manure amended soils zilles et al 2005 and can also be transformed and transported to the aquifers compared to groundwater under a forest area groundwater under human activities has lower ph and concentrations of trace elements but higher levels of nitrogen and sulfur containing metabolites kellner et al 2015 such changes in the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater are definite evidence of the impact of human activities on the cz the cz will continue to be affected by human activities and groundwater will harbor most of the metabolites and transformation products generated from these labours to understand the impact of these processes integrated studies of water collected from aquifers have become a powerful approach monitoring the current state of the cz and generating patterns that predict its future fate fan 2015 such knowledge helps to derive guidelines for the regulation of human activity establishing groundwater metabolomic patterns would allow us to estimate how the cz chemical inventory will be shaped in the future by the increasing influence of our activities bui 2016 goddéris and brantley 2013 our knowledge of the groundwater metabolome is however still limited because most of the mass spectrometry ms based studies have focused their efforts on the targeted identification of conventional pollutants and their derivates bletsou et al 2015 moreau et al 2019 or are localized to specific zones mcdonough et al 2020 or focused on the incorporation of domestic wastewater into aquifers edwards et al 2019 the lack of a broader analysis of the events occurring in the cz provides a limited overview of the ecosystem s functioning thus the complexity of groundwater ecosystems and the multiple biotic and abiotic factors shaping their chemistry demands a comprehensive approach that will allow us to understand the chemical dynamics in the cz untargeted lc ms based metabolomic approaches have emerged as tools that could contribute to monitoring metabolic signatures and single metabolites in the cz in this study we present the application of such an approach to identify metabolic patterns in the groundwater from various monitoring wells of the hainich critical zone exploratory cze in thuringia germany located at the eastern hillslope of the hainich low mountain range our approach does not follow up on pre determined hypotheses of the transport of specific metabolites but allows hypothesis generation about below ground dynamics and flows based on unbiased metabolomics data for the first time pristine areas and sites with agricultural activity with access to different aquifers in the multi story aquifer system of middle triassic limestone mudstone alternations lehmann and totsche 2020 were covered furthermore we also integrate the metabolic information with other studies carried out by complementary disciplines in the same monitoring wells and the human processes above ground to obtain insight into the metabolic connectivities below ground 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater sampling and site description groundwater samples for this study were collected during regular sampling campaigns within the coordinated monitoring program of the collaborative research center aquadiva crc aquadiva kohlhepp et al 2017 küsel et al 2016 sampling was performed with a submersible water pump mp1 grundfos denmark from monitoring wells located in a transect at the hainich critical zone exploratory cze in thuringia germany five litres of groundwater from eight wells accessing the two principal aquifers of the transect were sampled independently within 24 h in september of 2015 we chose this campaign because it took place after a recharge phase due to a high precipitation event providing enough groundwater samples in most of the wells it is also a campaign with strongly contrasting in situ physicochemical parameters among the wells lehmann and totsche 2020 previous studies on hydrodynamics and hydrochemistry during the installation of the wells indicate that the sampling of the comparably small volumes does not result in disruption of the system küsel et al 2016 thus sampling order did not have to be considered a factor influencing the metabolome this was also confirmed in a time series study of the metabolome zerfaß et al 2022 three sample replicates 5 l each were collected from each well the sampled wells covered three different land types h1 well h14 site in the forest h3 well h32 and h4 wells h41 to h43 sites in the pasture and h5 wells h51 to h53 site in agricultural land use fig 1 2 2 sample preparation to eliminate suspended particles from groundwater samples the entire 5 l samples were initially filtered independently through gf c glass fiber filters vwr germany ø 47 mm

500 mg 6 ml surface modified styrene divinylbenzene cartridges phenomenex aschaffenburg germany that were preconditioned with 5 ml of lc ms grade methanol fisher scientific gmbh germany therefore the 5 l were passed through the cartridge under a reduced pressure of 400 mbar after loading cartridges were washed with 5 ml of lc ms grade water fisher scientific gmbh germany followed by 5 min of air drying metabolites were eluted from the cartridges by gravity with 4 ml of methanol acetonitrile 1 1 v v into a 4 ml glass vial the eluates were dried under an n2 stream for one hour and then overnight under vacuum in a desiccator dried samples were reconstituted in 100 µl meoh thf 1 1 v v and transferred into 1 5 ml glass vials with 250 µl glass inserts for lc ms analysis aliquots of 50

sample 2 3 lc ms analysis the lc ms metabolic profiles of the groundwater samples were obtained by injecting two technical duplicates of l µl of each extract into a uhplc system dionex ultimate 3000

of 0 4 m z and normalized collision energy of 15 30 and 45 ev respectively all ms1 and ms2 raw data files obtained were uploaded in the metabolights repository haug et al 2019 and are fully accessible in the link www ebi ac uk metabolights mtbls3812 2 4 data processing the thermo raw data files were initially converted to mzxml format using the msconvert tool from proteowizard 3 0x software kessner et al 2008 to process the chromatographically separated and single spectra mass spectral data mzxml files of all replicates were organized into separate folders according to the treatments groundwater wells aquifer assemble access or wells depth and processed with the xcms 3 2 0 r package benton et al 2010 smith et al 2006 tautenhahn et al 2008 suplementary data 1 for lc ms data peak picking was performed with the centwave algorithm ppm 1 peakwidth c 5 20 prefilter c 6 50 000 mzcenterfun wmean integrate 1 mzdiff 0 001 fitgauss true noise 1e4 verbosecolumns true an initial alignment of the

camera 1 36 0 package kuhl et al 2012 was used to annotate possible isotopes and adducts present in our peak matrix and generate our final peak list for further statistical analysis suplementary data 1 2 5 statistical analysis multivariate statistical analyses were performed on the peak intensity matrix to reveal and understand relationships among the metabolic profiles of the groundwater samples from the monitoring wells using the metaboanalystr 2 0 package chong et al 2019 compound intensities among the samples were initially mean centered divided by the standard deviation of each feature equivalent to auto scaling and cube root transformed so that they exhibit a more normal or gaussian distribution a partial least squares discriminant analysis pls da was executed to visualize the separation of the metabolic profiles a heatmap of the top 20 most discriminant compounds according to their pls da variables importance on projection scores was generated the pearson correlation method was used for distance measure and ward as a clustering algorithm to explore the influence of the two aquifer systems along the hainich transect on the metabolic profiles the data were categorized according to the monitoring well s access to lower aquifer system las and the upper aquifer system uas the generated peak intensity table data was transformed scaled and analyzed as described previously to identify metabolites that change the most and are significantly different among the aquifer systems a volcano plot was generated comparing las uas applying a fold change fc threshold of 2 0 and a p value threshold of 0 05 data from monitoring wells located in the pasture h4 and agriculture h5 zones were analyzed independently to determine the depth effect on the groundwater metabolic profiles with h41 and h51 belonging to las and h42 h43 h52 and h53 to uas compound intensities among the wells were initially mean centered divided by the range of each variable equivalent to range scaling and cube root transformed pursuing a more normal or gaussian distribution of their values pls da was carried out to visualize the relationships a heatmap of the top 10 most discriminant compounds according to their pls da variables importance on projection scores was generated only for the h5 zone using the same correlation method and cluster algorithm described before to visualize the significant differences in the relative intensities of selected metabolites box plots of the transformed and scaled data were produced using r software version 3 2 0 r development core team 2015 2 6 putative compound identification the top 25 most discriminative compounds from the monitoring well analysis were putatively identified by calculating the exact masses of the metabolites matched to the measured accurate masses and the ion annotation information provided by camera adducts isotopes and neutral losses fragments executing an isotopic pattern analysis library spectral matching allowing a mass deviation of 5 ppm was performed in databases including metfrag metlin sirius and csi fingerid human metabolome database hmdb kegg and lipidmaps 3 results we obtained a mass peak list with 2322 features from the xcms analysis after removing all features present in the blanks features with coefficients of variation higher than 20 and features annotated as isotopes and adducts by camera a reduced peak list of 132 metabolites was obtained this was used for all the following multivariate statistical analyses 3 1 untargeted metabolomic analysis of all groundwater samples a pls da was carried out to obtain an overview of the relationships among the metabolic profiles of groundwater samples from all monitoring wells we recognized the discrimination of groundwater metabolic profiles by monitoring well location and aquifer system access at the hainich transect fig 2 component 1 of the pls da score plot explained 20 8 of the data variability it discriminated metabolic profiles of h14 h42 and h43 wells on the left side from those of h5 monitoring wells in all depths on the right h32 and h41 metabolic profiles are not separated in this component component 2 explained 12 7 of the total variability of the data and differentiated the metabolic profiles of groundwater from the monitoring wells with access to the las h14 h41 and h51 in the bottom from those profiles found in the monitoring wells that cover the uas h42 h43 h52 h53 in the top although the monitoring well h32 has been previously classified as part of the minor upper aquifer system kohlhepp et al 2017 in our analysis it is grouped with those wells from the main lower aquifer system fig 2 the separations observed in the pls da exposed five well discriminated metabolic clusters groundwater profiles from well h14 located in the upper part of the hillslope under forest influence constitute cluster 1 following the slope we find cluster 2 which comprises the metabolic profiles from wells h32 and h41 groundwater profiles from h51 are discriminated in cluster 3 and very close to cluster 2 cluster 4 encompasses groundwater metabolic profiles from wells h42 and h43 in cluster 5 metabolic profiles of wells h52 and h53 are included to visualize the relative amounts of the 20 most discriminant compounds responsible for the clustering in fig 2 a heatmap with the highest variables importance on projection was generated fig 3 left the metabolic profiles from the monitoring wells are divided into four main clusters reflecting their positions along the hillslope at the hainich cz the first cluster consists only of well h14 in the same direction monitoring well h32 alone forms the second cluster the third cluster comprises wells h51 h52 and h53 finally wells h41 h42 and h43 are grouped fig 3 left contrary to the pls da plot wells h32 and h41 are separated in this clustering the most discriminant compounds are divided into four primary areas of interest the first area includes four metabolites present in the highest relative concentrations in the monitoring well h53 and the lowest in h14 the second area of interest comprised five compounds showing higher levels in h52 and h53 and h42 five compounds are grouped in the third area displaying higher levels in wells h14 h32 h42 and h43 and low amounts in h53 the fourth area comprises six compounds with higher levels in well h14 and h32 but more attenuate in the boxplot fig 3 right we show the levels of compound number 8 in all monitoring wells this compound was putatively identified as the peptide 2 2 2 2 6 amino 2 2 aminoacetyl amino hexanoyl amino 5 diaminomethylideneamino pentanoyl amino 3 hydroxypropanoyl amino propanoylamino pentanedioic acid supplementary table 1 it displayed higher levels in the monitoring well h14 located in the forest site at the hainich cz 3 2 untargeted groundwater metabolomic analysis of aquifer assemblage effects the clusters identified from the heatmap with the top 20 most discriminated compounds fig 3a motivated to study if the access to the different depth aquifer systems las or uas impacts the metabolic profiles of groundwater samples hence we compared the profiling data according to the aquifer system accessed by the various monitoring wells at the hainich cz hillslope according to the aquifer system accessed the metabolic groundwater profiles are well discriminated in the pls da score plot fig 4 the pls da component 1 explains the 21 6 of data s variability and discriminates those wells accessing the las on the left from those accessing the uas on the right a volcano plot was constructed to identify compounds with high magnitudes of change that are also significantly different among the two aquifer systems fig 5 left twelve compounds were significantly higher in the groundwater metabolic profiles from those monitoring wells with access to the uas the boxplot fig 5 depicts the relative levels of compound 70 significantly higher in the uas than in las this compound was putatively identified as a betulin derivative in contrast only one compound number 8 was significantly higher in the lower aquifer system 3 3 untargeted site specific metabolomic analysis to confirm that the aquifer transects found in the hillslope of the hainich cz influence the metabolic profiles of the groundwater at a specific site we compared separately the chemical profiles from all monitoring wells in sites h4 and h5 by performing a pls da metabolic profiles of wells from both h4 and h5 sites are grouped separately components 1 explained the 43 3 and 42 3 h4 and h5 respectively of total data variability and separated the metabolic profiles of wells with access to the uas h42 h43 and h52 h53 from the profiles of the wells approaching the las h41 and h51 component 2 explaining the 15 6 and 24 2 h4 and h5 respectively of the variability separates h42 and h52 metabolic profiles from the profiles obtained from the other wells fig 6 the heatmap of the top 10 most discriminant metabolites from the pls da of h5 showed how monitoring wells with access to the uas h52 and h53 clustered together separated from the monitoring well in contact with the las h51 fig 7 a the most discriminant compounds for h5 are divided into three main areas of interest in the first area compound 117 is less abundant in well h53 in a second area compounds 70 and 68 have significantly higher abundances only in well h53 the third area comprises seven more abundant compounds in h52 and h53 than in h51 figs 7b and 7c show the abundances of compounds 117 and 68 for all the h5 wells compound 117 was putatively identified as a derivative of catechol estrogens in low concentrations in well h53 uas conversely compound 68 putatively identified as a benzoxazinone derivative was found in significantly higher levels in groundwater from well h53 uas compared to its level in the other wells with access to the las 4 discussion 4 1 groundwater metabolomic clusters we applied an untargeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms based metabolomic approach to explore and understand the relationships among the chemical profiles of groundwater samples from the monitoring wells located at the hainich critical zone this work focuses on the spatial relation of metabolomic patterns within the observatory an accompanying study analyses the time course of metabolomic developments below ground over several years zerfaß et al 2022 the multivariate analysis of the metabolic profiles revealed patterns among the groundwater chemistries of monitoring wells according to their location in the hillslope and the aquifer system accessed in our metabolomic analysis fig 2 the summit well h14 was grouped in cluster 1 note that the cluster numbers are informal and introduced to guide the discussion this part of the hillslope is the recharge area of the lower aquifer system las with an input of chemical signals derived from the forest vegetation to the groundwater küsel et al 2016 high ph and redox potential eh as well as high levels of dissolved o2 total organic carbon toc and ca2 are some of the hydrochemistry factors that defined this area as an independent cluster and differentiated it from the rest of the hillslope areas kohlhepp et al 2017 in accordance yan et al 2020 have established this area as the richest in bacterial diversity with the highest number of rare microbiological species this cluster has also been characterized by the highest fraction of sequence reads affiliated with fungal groups herrmann et al 2020 from our top 20 most discriminant compounds six were highly predominant in the metabolic profiles of h14 groundwater fig 3a compound number 41 a thiazole containing natural product was putatively identified as an epothilone derivative this family of metabolites has been isolated from the myxobacterium sorangium cellulosum wang et al 2011 this bacteria order belongs to the proteobacteria phylum which is highly abundant and well distributed in soils and groundwater dawid 2000 gülay et al 2016 zhou et al 2014 including water from well h14 in the hainich cz yan et al 2020 compound 19 is also more abundant in h14 groundwater and was putatively classified as a folic acid derivative folates are synthesized de novo in plants and various microorganisms ravanel et al 2011 in plants they are critical components for the transfer of single carbon units and are involved in the biosynthesis of vital components like nucleic acids and amino acids hanson and gregory iii 2002 hence compound 19 found could originate from folates in the plant litter material in the journey through the soil compounds face a metabolically active heterotrophic microbial community yan et al 2020 and suffer a variety of transformations alidina et al 2014 jobelius et al 2011 given the largely uncharacterized microbial population most of these metabolites will be novel our library based identification approach will thus likely give only hints about compound classes but not the precise structures compound 8 with a notable abundance mostly in h14 groundwater fig 3b was putatively identified as a peptide 2 2 2 2 6 amino 2 2 aminoacetyl amino hexanoyl amino 5 diaminomethylideneamino pentanoyl amino 3 hydroxypropanoyl amino propanoylamino pentanedioic acid such small peptides are important for plant growth and developmental processes tabata and sawa 2014 the high levels found in the groundwater of monitoring well h14 confirm its origin from the plant material present in the forest site since this site is considered a recharge area for the las the small peptides secreted in the rhizosphere could be transported with the leachate water to the aquifers and further transformed roth et al 2019 this observation also supports previous studies suggesting that metabolites found in underground environments could be closely associated with the source materials above ground leinemann et al 2018 the metabolic profiles of groundwater from wells h32 and h41 were grouped in the center of our pls da score plot assigned as metabolic cluster 2 these wells were also classified into the hydrochemical cluster 2 by kohlhepp et al 2017 due to their high hco3 no2 and toc concentrations surprisingly the study of the microbial communities in the groundwater of these wells separated them into different clusters with only groundwater from h32 in microbial cluster 2 and h41 in microbial cluster 6 yan et al 2020 this discrimination was not observed in our pls da but they get assigned to different groups when only the 20 most discriminative compounds are used for the clustering fig 3 down in the hillslope the groundwater metabolic profiles from wells h51 h42 h43 h52 and h53 were grouped into three clusters corresponding to the previously reported patterns from analysis of the hydrochemistry kohlhepp et al 2017 and microbiology yan et al 2020 metabolic cluster 3 with the metabolic profile of h51 has been characterized by high concentrations of so4 2 ca2 cl and high eh kohlhepp et al 2017 as well as high proportions of unsaturated and polyphenolic compounds probably derived from surface dissolved organic matter dom benk et al 2019 in metabolic cluster 4 the profiles of wells h42 and h43 were grouped high levels of fe2 3 mn2 4 toc and cl have been described in this cluster together with low concentrations of dissolved o2 and low redox potential kohlhepp et al 2017 finally metabolic profiles of wells h52 and h53 were classified as metabolic cluster 5 and as in h4 wells hydrochemistry has been characterized as an anoxic zone due to deficient levels of dissolved o2 however with high levels of k na and mg2 kohlhepp et al 2017 among the most discriminant metabolites compound 27 reached very high concentrations in wells h53 and h52 metabolic cluster 5 and was putatively identified as a streptogramin derivate streptogramins are cyclic peptides produced by streptomyces spp frequently isolated from soils gonzález et al 1999 hence the compound could originate from the streptomycetes identified in this zone of the hainich cz yan et al 2020 however the bacterial production of streptogramin does not explain the high levels found here compared to other clusters streptogramins have also been used as antibiotics for veterinary purposes their inclusion in animal feed generates manures rich in those antimicrobials since ongoing agricultural practices use animal residues to enhance soil conditions for crops streptogramin has been detected in swine manures and amended soils zhou et al 2010 zilles et al 2005 the high levels of streptogramin derivatives in the groundwater of metabolic cluster 5 with access to a shallow aquifer under agriculture activity indicates that molecules incorporated by above ground human activities could be transported through the soil and reach aquifer waters kaiser and kalbitz 2012 compound 46 putatively identified as 5 acetyloxy 6 6 11 trimethyl 16 oxo 15 oxapentacyclo 9 3 2 15 8 01 10 02 8 heptadec 12 ene 9 carboxylic acid a d ring modified gibberellin was found in high levels in h52 and h53 gibberellins are hormones that regulate vital processes such as germination growth and flowering in plants schwechheimer 2012 these hormones are widely used in agriculture to increase yield promote flowering and break dormancy rappaport 1980 therefore gibberellins can be incorporated into soils and transported to the aquifers due to these agricultural practices microorganisms isolated from rhizospheres also produce gibberellins affecting the development of their associated plants and could be an alternative source for the hormones detected in our study brown 1972 our metabolomic analysis of groundwater samples from the monitoring wells reveals five metabolic clusters these clusters indicate that the position of the monitoring wells in the hillslope and the aquifer system accessed see below are essentially shaping the metabolic profiles of the groundwater additionally the strong correlations with previously established microbial clusters suggest an active influence of microorganisms on metabolic profiles the structures of the putatively identified compounds reveal how plant metabolites and human practices impact the hainich cz further laboratory scale experiments could provide a detailed understanding of the metabolite microorganism network occurring in the groundwater 4 2 groundwater metabolomes reflect the aquifer system accessed our results show how the above ground recharging areas define the chemistry of the groundwater metabolic profiles groundwater from the uas displayed a significantly higher abundance compared to the las of metabolites from above ground human activities like agriculture and pasture we verified that the aquifer system accessed differentiates the metabolic profiles therefore we addressed how the distribution of the monitoring wells among the upper aquifer system uas and the lower aquifer system las impacts the metabolic profiles of groundwater samples fig 4 several compounds with elevated concentrations in uas were identified whereas only compound 8 was more abundant in las fig 5 compound 8 is a plant derived compound influenced mainly by the monitoring well h14 in the forest area considered the recharging area of las küsel et al 2016 these patterns are consistent with the configuration of the hainich cz where uas would be the immediate destiny of all chemical compounds in their path through the ground from the agricultural recharging areas uas is characterized by joints and dissolution pores and is classified as a midstream aquifer kohlhepp et al 2017 küsel et al 2016 uas would also accumulate a higher amount of compounds from above ground activities conversely las has more extensive fractures allowing higher water flows kohlhepp et al 2017 küsel et al 2016 thus resulting in a higher dilution of the metabolites agricultural practices generate a higher groundwater recharge than other land uses priyantha ranjan et al 2006 the changes in groundwater chemistry are then mostly related to the introduction of chemical products used in anthropogenic practices nonetheless the alteration in the activity of extracellular enzymes in the rhizosphere can also have a significant influence on those changes tischer et al 2019 as well as the enzymatic activities by bacterial communities in the seepage and shallow groundwater herrmann et al 2019 yan et al 2020 the metabolomic patterns observed between the upper and lower aquifer systems are thus not only the product of the above ground activity in the respective recharging areas but also the microbial and biochemical activity below ground the interplay between these factors is nicely reflected in the relationships observed in the untargeted data analysis figs 2 4 and 6 among the significantly more abundant compounds in uas fig 5 right is compound 70 putatively identified as betulin derivative such naturally occurring triterpenes are highly abundant in trees and grasses pai and joshi 2014 betulin derivatives have recently also been identified in the organic preparation stimulin altai agro gardens llc gorelova et al 2020 that promotes germination and yield in plants kosachev et al 2021 the use of betulin products in agriculture and the natural production of this triterpene in plants might be sources of these molecules once in the soil they could be altered by the microbial and enzymatic activities and transported further our metabolomic analysis confirmed that the aquifer accessed by the monitoring wells is essential in differentiating between groundwater s metabolic profiles the recharging areas provide the critical input signals differentiating these aquifer systems 4 3 groundwater metabolomes are not only aquifer specific depth is a significant factor in the discrimination of the groundwater chemistry as revealed by comparing metabolic profiles in wells located in the h4 and h5 sites these sites at the hillslope are influenced above ground by pasture and agricultural activities respectively and access different aquifer systems allowing joint analysis of horizontal and vertical transportation and transformation processes the multivariate analysis of wells h4 and h5 not only confirmed the differences between the metabolic profiles of groundwater from h41 and h51 metabolic clusters 2 and 3 from those of wells h42 h43 and h52 h53 metabolic clusters 4 and 5 but the components 2 revealed differences between wells in this last metabolic clusters between h42 h52 and h43 h53 fig 6a and 6b depth and aquifer system access are thus significant factors influencing the chemical composition in the biogeosphere the marked discrimination obtained between metabolic clusters 2 h41 and 4 h42 and h43 as well as 3 h51 and 5 h52 and h53 corresponds with their access to the uas and las the influence of depth on groundwater hydrochemistry has already been reported edmunds et al 2003 hanson and abraham 2009 hydrochemical differences have also been elucidated at the hainich cz between uas and las kohlhepp et al 2017 showing that the aquifer systems depth at our study site also has a substantial impact on the biogeochemical processes depth is not to be understood as purely the vertical distance from the surface but rather a factor defined by the aquifer systems even at deeper depths the metabolic differences observed between groundwater of wells h42 and h43 as well as between h52 and h53 having access to the uas could be attributed to input signals from the surface probably derived from pasture or agricultural practices like those mentioned in the previous analysis some studies have also found how concentrations of doc and dom into the vadose zone vary with the depth pabich et al 2001 roth et al 2019 those variations result from biogeochemical processes and the prevalence of metabolites in the respective aquifers the seven most discriminated metabolites of this analysis differentiate metabolic cluster 3 deeper aquifer system from cluster 5 upper aquifer system at site h5 besides compounds 117 70 and 68 helped discriminate monitoring wells in the vadose zone compound 117 for example was putatively identified as a derivative of catechol estrogens and was practically absent in groundwater of well h53 fig 7a and b the contribution of steroidal estrogens to the environment by farm animals has been determined to be potentially more significant than humans contribution shrestha et al 2012 socas rodríguez et al 2017 as already discussed livestock manure to amend soils for agriculture could also be the input source of this molecule in the groundwater interestingly this compound was not found in high levels in the groundwater of well h53 at the site where these practices occur three different scenarios could explain these low levels 1 there is a reduced vertical transport of input signals directly from above ground into h53 through the vadose zone probably generated by the already identified multi directional flow and the configuration of sloping bedrock strata in the hainich cze lehmann and totsche 2020 2 the microbial and enzymatic transformation of these compounds during the passage and 3 the fast supply of surface input signals and transformation products from 2 into the deeper aquifer system caused by the exchange of multi directional flow dynamics between the aeration and phreatic zones lehmann and totsche 2020 evidence for remaining vertical transport stems from compounds 70 and 68 they showed significantly higher levels in groundwater from well h53 compared to h51 and h52 located further down compound 68 was putatively identified as a benzoxazinone derivative benzoxazinones are metabolites commonly found in essential crops like maize wheat and rye and play a role as defense molecules when glycosylated sicker et al 2000 sicker and schulz 2002 these metabolites can be introduced in the upper vadose zone by incorporating cereal sprouts as an agricultural strategy to increase soil fertility krogh et al 2006 villagrasa et al 2009 this evidence allows us to speculate that compound 68 may originate from those agricultural practices occurring above ground of monitoring well h53 and that there is a particular vertical but slow transport our findings confirm that the singularity of the groundwater metabolic profiles from the monitoring wells at the hainich cz is aquifer specific and strongly influenced by the depth 4 4 general considerations our lc ms based untargeted metabolomics analysis of groundwater from monitoring wells located in a transect at the hainich cze revealed distinct differences among their metabolic profiles it allowed us to putatively identify key molecules that are responsible for the associations observed our results suggest that well location aquifer system access and aquifer depth are critical factors determining the differences among groundwater metabolomes well location determines the chemical nature of input signals from above ground that are incorporated into the aquifers in the forest area wells are predominantely provided with plant derived compounds and wells located in anthropogenically altered areas face the input of compounds related to human activities the depth and access to an upper or lower aquifer system also defines the chemical diversity of the groundwater the metabolome of upper aquifer systems may receive immediate input signals from plant and anthropogenic activities occurring on the surface conversely in lower aquifer systems the metabolome may be dominated by microorganism derived metabolites however further time series studies must be carried out that consider the multi directional flow dynamics in the hainich cze the correlations of our metabolic clusters with previous established microbial and biogeochemical clusters defined in the same sampling wells indicate the notorious role of microorganisms and their microenvironments in shaping groundwater s chemical nature metabolites found in groundwater might be not only the energy and nutrient source for microorganisms but also could be the product of their enzymatic transformations thus deciphering microbial and metabolome interactions in groundwater would be the ticket to elucidate the dynamics in the cz 5 conclusions this work shows that studying the chemical diversity of groundwater with an untargeted lc ms based metabolomic approach is a powerful approach that provides insights into understanding the intricate chemical networks occurring within the cz without the need to introduce external makers our publicly available data will serve as a basis for further identifying indicator metabolites that can be used as biomarkers these metabolites will serve as lead

15920,in the earth s critical zone water plays an essential role as a collector and transporter of metabolites and their transformation products it is generally believed that the chemical profiles of groundwater are strongly impacted by land use however predictors for the effects of above ground natural and anthropogenic activities on below ground chemistry are rare we reasoned that comparing groundwater metabolomes from different land use sites and depths can give insight into this coupling of above and below ground processes in the critical zone this study used an lc ms based untargeted metabolomic approach to identify links between groundwater metabolomes from monitoring wells in fractured carbonate siliciclastic alternations along a hillslope of the hainich critical zone exploratory cze in thuringia germany our results identify the land use type aquifer system and sampling depth as critical factors determining the differences among groundwater metabolomes we established five groundwater metabolic clusters and correlated these to the aquifer systems hydrogeochemistry and microbial community composition our untargeted metabolomic approach reveals the limited connectivity of groundwater chemical profiles with above ground activities and illustrates how deep the input signals can travel graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords earth s critical zone untargeted metabolomics groundwater metabolomics lc ms aquifers 1 introduction earth s critical zone cz is the heterogeneous section of our planet that encompasses the canopy of trees down to the bedrock including the associated groundwater from the aquifers lin 2010 it is undeniably critical because all processes that sustain life occur in this zone and it is severely affected by anthropogenic activities burri et al 2019 the cz comprises complex processes originating with rainwater as the main factor in renewing groundwater systems during the infiltration through the soil the seepage water compiles air dissolved organic matter dom guggenberger and kaiser 2003 other earth materials gleixner 2013 schrumpf et al 2013 and biota brantley et al 2007 dibbern et al 2014 biogeochemical processes along the path of seepage water determine aquifers hydrogeochemical and microbiological composition canora et al 2008 urich and conservation 2002 microbial transformation processes determine the metabolic diversity along the passage of seepage water and aquifer assemblages recent evidence suggests that soil microbial diversity can explain at least 25 of the variability of dom in the cz but over 40 of its variation is still unexplained roth et al 2019 the unexplained variation of dom can be caused by plant derived compounds which depend on plant composition and diversity above ground einsiedl et al 2007 gleixner 2013 gleixner et al 2002 kaiser and kalbitz 2012 other findings indicate that microbial communities and their enzymatic activities adapt to depth variations of the dom composition leinemann et al 2018 and along the land use slope kamjunke et al 2019 and thereby affect the chemical inventory in various ways groundwater microbial diversity is crucially connected with the chemical environment and evolves with the availability of dissolved organic carbon guo et al 2019 therefore a microbial selection of the chemical environment may also influence community diversity in groundwater yan et al 2020 consecutively new metabolomic conditions along the seepage water passage may be established above ground anthropogenic activities like agriculture are a threat to cz balance the human impact over large above ground areas generates critical changes in the geology of the cz vitousek et al 1997 wilkinson and mcelroy 2007 land use can also condition the enzyme activities in rhizosphere soil tischer et al 2019 and seepage water will carry the new products down to the groundwater changing microbial composition consequently above ground activity and changes in land cover will impact not only the groundwater recharge canora et al 2008 scanlon et al 2005 or the storage prabhakar and tiwari 2015 but also the resources and quality denizman 2018 fianko et al 2009 khan et al 2017 lerner and harris 2009 priyantha ranjan et al 2006 the effects of anthropogenic processes have also been identified in complex aquifer assemblies in a long term study sheikhy narany et al 2018 indicating that groundwater reservoirs are always affected by the intense exploitation of the land agriculture and pasture practices are among the principal human activities impacting groundwater organic pollutants op originating from those activities are also found in groundwater and have gained substantial interest edwards et al 2019 schmidt 2018 trček et al 2018 herbicides for example get incorporated into the soils and are transformed there into new compounds that become part of the aquifers walker and brown 1985 likewise some veterinarian drugs have been found in manure amended soils zilles et al 2005 and can also be transformed and transported to the aquifers compared to groundwater under a forest area groundwater under human activities has lower ph and concentrations of trace elements but higher levels of nitrogen and sulfur containing metabolites kellner et al 2015 such changes in the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater are definite evidence of the impact of human activities on the cz the cz will continue to be affected by human activities and groundwater will harbor most of the metabolites and transformation products generated from these labours to understand the impact of these processes integrated studies of water collected from aquifers have become a powerful approach monitoring the current state of the cz and generating patterns that predict its future fate fan 2015 such knowledge helps to derive guidelines for the regulation of human activity establishing groundwater metabolomic patterns would allow us to estimate how the cz chemical inventory will be shaped in the future by the increasing influence of our activities bui 2016 goddéris and brantley 2013 our knowledge of the groundwater metabolome is however still limited because most of the mass spectrometry ms based studies have focused their efforts on the targeted identification of conventional pollutants and their derivates bletsou et al 2015 moreau et al 2019 or are localized to specific zones mcdonough et al 2020 or focused on the incorporation of domestic wastewater into aquifers edwards et al 2019 the lack of a broader analysis of the events occurring in the cz provides a limited overview of the ecosystem s functioning thus the complexity of groundwater ecosystems and the multiple biotic and abiotic factors shaping their chemistry demands a comprehensive approach that will allow us to understand the chemical dynamics in the cz untargeted lc ms based metabolomic approaches have emerged as tools that could contribute to monitoring metabolic signatures and single metabolites in the cz in this study we present the application of such an approach to identify metabolic patterns in the groundwater from various monitoring wells of the hainich critical zone exploratory cze in thuringia germany located at the eastern hillslope of the hainich low mountain range our approach does not follow up on pre determined hypotheses of the transport of specific metabolites but allows hypothesis generation about below ground dynamics and flows based on unbiased metabolomics data for the first time pristine areas and sites with agricultural activity with access to different aquifers in the multi story aquifer system of middle triassic limestone mudstone alternations lehmann and totsche 2020 were covered furthermore we also integrate the metabolic information with other studies carried out by complementary disciplines in the same monitoring wells and the human processes above ground to obtain insight into the metabolic connectivities below ground 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater sampling and site description groundwater samples for this study were collected during regular sampling campaigns within the coordinated monitoring program of the collaborative research center aquadiva crc aquadiva kohlhepp et al 2017 küsel et al 2016 sampling was performed with a submersible water pump mp1 grundfos denmark from monitoring wells located in a transect at the hainich critical zone exploratory cze in thuringia germany five litres of groundwater from eight wells accessing the two principal aquifers of the transect were sampled independently within 24 h in september of 2015 we chose this campaign because it took place after a recharge phase due to a high precipitation event providing enough groundwater samples in most of the wells it is also a campaign with strongly contrasting in situ physicochemical parameters among the wells lehmann and totsche 2020 previous studies on hydrodynamics and hydrochemistry during the installation of the wells indicate that the sampling of the comparably small volumes does not result in disruption of the system küsel et al 2016 thus sampling order did not have to be considered a factor influencing the metabolome this was also confirmed in a time series study of the metabolome zerfaß et al 2022 three sample replicates 5 l each were collected from each well the sampled wells covered three different land types h1 well h14 site in the forest h3 well h32 and h4 wells h41 to h43 sites in the pasture and h5 wells h51 to h53 site in agricultural land use fig 1 2 2 sample preparation to eliminate suspended particles from groundwater samples the entire 5 l samples were initially filtered independently through gf c glass fiber filters vwr germany ø 47 mm

drying metabolites were eluted from the cartridges by gravity with 4 ml of methanol acetonitrile 1 1 v v into a 4 ml glass vial the eluates were dried under an n2 stream for one hour and then overnight under vacuum in a desiccator dried samples were reconstituted in 100 µl meoh thf 1 1 v v and transferred into 1 5 ml glass vials with 250 µl glass inserts for lc ms analysis aliquots of 50

in the link www ebi ac uk metabolights mtbls3812 2 4 data processing the thermo raw data files were initially converted to mzxml format using the msconvert tool from proteowizard 3 0x software kessner et al 2008 to process the chromatographically separated and single spectra mass spectral data mzxml files of all replicates were organized into separate folders according to the treatments groundwater wells aquifer assemble access or wells depth and processed with the xcms 3 2 0 r package benton et al 2010 smith et al 2006 tautenhahn et al 2008 suplementary data 1 for lc ms data peak picking was

camera 1 36 0 package kuhl et al 2012 was used to annotate possible isotopes and adducts present in our peak matrix and generate our final peak list for further statistical analysis suplementary data 1 2 5 statistical analysis multivariate statistical analyses were performed on the peak intensity matrix to reveal and understand relationships among the metabolic profiles of the groundwater samples from the monitoring wells using the metaboanalystr 2 0 package chong et al 2019 compound intensities among the samples were initially mean centered divided by the standard deviation of each feature equivalent to auto scaling and cube root transformed so that they exhibit a more normal or gaussian distribution a partial least squares discriminant analysis pls da was executed to visualize the separation of the metabolic profiles a heatmap of the top 20 most discriminant compounds according to their pls da variables importance on projection scores was generated the pearson correlation method was used for distance measure and ward as a clustering algorithm to explore the influence of the two aquifer systems along the hainich transect on the metabolic profiles the data were categorized according to the monitoring well s access to lower aquifer system las and the upper aquifer system uas the generated peak intensity table data was transformed scaled and analyzed as described previously to identify metabolites that change the most and are significantly different among the aquifer systems a volcano plot was generated comparing las uas applying a fold change fc threshold of 2 0 and a p value threshold of 0 05 data from monitoring wells located in the pasture h4 and agriculture h5 zones were analyzed independently to determine the depth effect on the groundwater metabolic profiles with h41 and h51 belonging to las and h42 h43 h52 and h53 to uas compound intensities among the wells were initially mean centered divided by the range of each variable equivalent to range scaling and cube root transformed pursuing a more normal or gaussian distribution of their values pls da was carried out to visualize the relationships a heatmap of the top 10 most discriminant compounds according to their pls da variables importance on projection scores was generated only for the h5 zone using the same correlation method and cluster algorithm described before to visualize the significant differences in the relative intensities of selected metabolites box plots of the transformed and scaled data were produced using r software version 3 2 0 r development core team 2015 2 6 putative compound identification the top 25 most discriminative compounds from the monitoring well analysis were putatively identified by calculating the exact masses of the metabolites matched to the measured accurate masses and the ion annotation information provided by camera adducts isotopes and neutral losses fragments executing an isotopic pattern analysis library spectral matching allowing a mass deviation of 5 ppm was performed in databases including metfrag metlin sirius and csi fingerid human metabolome database hmdb kegg and lipidmaps 3 results we obtained a mass peak list with 2322 features from the xcms analysis after removing all features present in the blanks features with coefficients of variation higher than 20 and features annotated as isotopes and adducts by camera a reduced peak list of 132 metabolites was obtained this was used for all the following multivariate statistical analyses 3 1 untargeted metabolomic analysis of all groundwater samples a pls da was carried out to obtain an overview of the relationships among the metabolic profiles of groundwater samples from all monitoring wells we recognized the discrimination of groundwater metabolic profiles by monitoring well location and aquifer system access at the hainich transect fig 2 component 1 of the pls da score plot explained 20 8 of the data variability it discriminated metabolic profiles of h14 h42 and h43 wells on the left side from those of h5 monitoring wells in all depths on the right h32 and h41 metabolic profiles are not separated in this component component 2 explained 12 7 of the total variability of the data and differentiated the metabolic profiles of groundwater from the monitoring wells with access to the las h14 h41 and h51 in the bottom from those profiles found in the monitoring wells that cover the uas h42 h43 h52 h53 in the top although the monitoring well h32 has been previously classified as part of the minor upper aquifer system kohlhepp et al 2017 in our analysis it is grouped with those wells from the main lower aquifer system fig 2 the separations observed in the pls da exposed five well discriminated metabolic clusters groundwater profiles from well h14 located in the upper part of the hillslope under forest influence constitute cluster 1 following the slope we find cluster 2 which comprises the metabolic profiles from wells h32 and h41 groundwater profiles from h51 are discriminated in cluster 3 and very close to cluster 2 cluster 4 encompasses groundwater metabolic profiles from wells h42 and h43 in cluster 5 metabolic profiles of wells h52 and h53 are included to visualize the relative amounts of the 20 most discriminant compounds responsible for the clustering in fig 2 a heatmap with the highest variables importance on projection was generated fig 3 left the metabolic profiles from the monitoring wells are divided into four main clusters reflecting their positions along the hillslope at the hainich cz the first cluster consists only of well h14 in the same direction monitoring well h32 alone forms the second cluster the third cluster comprises wells h51 h52 and h53 finally wells h41 h42 and h43 are grouped fig 3 left contrary to the pls da plot wells h32 and h41 are separated in this clustering the most discriminant compounds are divided into four primary areas of interest the first area includes four metabolites present in the highest relative concentrations in the monitoring well h53 and the lowest in h14 the second area of interest comprised five compounds showing higher levels in h52 and h53 and h42 five compounds are grouped in the third area displaying higher levels in wells h14 h32 h42 and h43 and low amounts in h53 the fourth area comprises six compounds with higher levels in well h14 and h32 but more attenuate in the boxplot fig 3 right we show the levels of compound number 8 in all monitoring wells this compound was putatively identified as the peptide 2 2 2 2 6 amino 2 2 aminoacetyl amino hexanoyl amino 5 diaminomethylideneamino pentanoyl amino 3 hydroxypropanoyl amino propanoylamino pentanedioic acid supplementary table 1 it displayed higher levels in the monitoring well h14 located in the forest site at the hainich cz 3 2 untargeted groundwater metabolomic analysis of aquifer assemblage effects the clusters identified from the heatmap with the top 20 most discriminated compounds fig 3a motivated to study if the access to the different depth aquifer systems las or uas impacts the metabolic profiles of groundwater samples hence we compared the profiling data according to the aquifer system accessed by the various monitoring wells at the hainich cz hillslope according to the aquifer system accessed the metabolic groundwater profiles are well discriminated in the pls da score plot fig 4 the pls da component 1 explains the 21 6 of data s variability and discriminates those wells accessing the las on the left from those accessing the uas on the right a volcano plot was constructed to identify compounds with high magnitudes of change that are also significantly different among the two aquifer systems fig 5 left twelve compounds were significantly higher in the groundwater metabolic profiles from those monitoring wells with access to the uas the boxplot fig 5 depicts the relative levels of compound 70 significantly higher in the uas than in las this compound was putatively identified as a betulin derivative in contrast only one compound number 8 was significantly higher in the lower aquifer system 3 3 untargeted site specific metabolomic analysis to confirm that the aquifer transects found in the hillslope of the hainich cz influence the metabolic profiles of the groundwater at a specific site we compared separately the chemical profiles from all monitoring wells in sites h4 and h5 by performing a pls da metabolic profiles of wells from both h4 and h5 sites are grouped separately components 1 explained the 43 3 and 42 3 h4 and h5 respectively of total data variability and separated the metabolic profiles of wells with access to the uas h42 h43 and h52 h53 from the profiles of the wells approaching the las h41 and h51 component 2 explaining the 15 6 and 24 2 h4 and h5 respectively of the variability separates h42 and h52 metabolic profiles from the profiles obtained from the other wells fig 6 the heatmap of the top 10 most discriminant metabolites from the pls da of h5 showed how monitoring wells with access to the uas h52 and h53 clustered together separated from the monitoring well in contact with the las h51 fig 7 a the most discriminant compounds for h5 are divided into three main areas of interest in the first area compound 117 is less abundant in well h53 in a second area compounds 70 and 68 have significantly higher abundances only in well h53 the third area comprises seven more abundant compounds in h52 and h53 than in h51 figs 7b and 7c show the abundances of compounds 117 and 68 for all the h5 wells compound 117 was putatively identified as a derivative of catechol estrogens in low concentrations in well h53 uas conversely compound 68 putatively identified as a benzoxazinone derivative was found in significantly higher levels in groundwater from well h53 uas compared to its level in the other wells with access to the las 4 discussion 4 1 groundwater metabolomic clusters we applied an untargeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms based metabolomic approach to explore and understand the relationships among the chemical profiles of groundwater samples from the monitoring wells located at the hainich critical zone this work focuses on the spatial relation of metabolomic patterns within the observatory an accompanying study analyses the time course of metabolomic developments below ground over several years zerfaß et al 2022 the multivariate analysis of the metabolic profiles revealed patterns among the groundwater chemistries of monitoring wells according to their location in the hillslope and the aquifer system accessed in our metabolomic analysis fig 2 the summit well h14 was grouped in cluster 1 note that the cluster numbers are informal and introduced to guide the discussion this part of the hillslope is the recharge area of the lower aquifer system las with an input of chemical signals derived from the forest vegetation to the groundwater küsel et al 2016 high ph and redox potential eh as well as high levels of dissolved o2 total organic carbon toc and ca2 are some of the hydrochemistry factors that defined this area as an independent cluster and differentiated it from the rest of the hillslope areas kohlhepp et al 2017 in accordance yan et al 2020 have established this area as the richest in bacterial diversity with the highest number of rare microbiological species this cluster has also been characterized by the highest fraction of sequence reads affiliated with fungal groups herrmann et al 2020 from our top 20 most discriminant compounds six were highly predominant in the metabolic profiles of h14 groundwater fig 3a compound number 41 a thiazole containing natural product was putatively identified as an epothilone derivative this family of metabolites has been isolated from the myxobacterium sorangium cellulosum wang et al 2011 this bacteria order belongs to the proteobacteria phylum which is highly abundant and well distributed in soils and groundwater dawid 2000 gülay et al 2016 zhou et al 2014 including water from well h14 in the hainich cz yan et al 2020 compound 19 is also more abundant in h14 groundwater and was putatively classified as a folic acid derivative folates are synthesized de novo in plants and various microorganisms ravanel et al 2011 in plants they are critical components for the transfer of single carbon units and are involved in the biosynthesis of vital components like nucleic acids and amino acids hanson and gregory iii 2002 hence compound 19 found could originate from folates in the plant litter material in the journey through the soil compounds face a metabolically active heterotrophic microbial community yan et al 2020 and suffer a variety of transformations alidina et al 2014 jobelius et al 2011 given the largely uncharacterized microbial population most of these metabolites will be novel our library based identification approach will thus likely give only hints about compound classes but not the precise structures compound 8 with a notable abundance mostly in h14 groundwater fig 3b was putatively identified as a peptide 2 2 2 2 6 amino 2 2 aminoacetyl amino hexanoyl amino 5 diaminomethylideneamino pentanoyl amino 3 hydroxypropanoyl amino propanoylamino pentanedioic acid such small peptides are important for plant growth and developmental processes tabata and sawa 2014 the high levels found in the groundwater of monitoring well h14 confirm its origin from the plant material present in the forest site since this site is considered a recharge area for the las the small peptides secreted in the rhizosphere could be transported with the leachate water to the aquifers and further transformed roth et al 2019 this observation also supports previous studies suggesting that metabolites found in underground environments could be closely associated with the source materials above ground leinemann et al 2018 the metabolic profiles of groundwater from wells h32 and h41 were grouped in the center of our pls da score plot assigned as metabolic cluster 2 these wells were also classified into the hydrochemical cluster 2 by kohlhepp et al 2017 due to their high hco3 no2 and toc concentrations surprisingly the study of the microbial communities in the groundwater of these wells separated them into different clusters with only groundwater from h32 in microbial cluster 2 and h41 in microbial cluster 6 yan et al 2020 this discrimination was not observed in our pls da but they get assigned to different groups when only the 20 most discriminative compounds are used for the clustering fig 3 down in the hillslope the groundwater metabolic profiles from wells h51 h42 h43 h52 and h53 were grouped into three clusters corresponding to the previously reported patterns from analysis of the hydrochemistry kohlhepp et al 2017 and microbiology yan et al 2020 metabolic cluster 3 with the metabolic profile of h51 has been characterized by high concentrations of so4 2 ca2 cl and high eh kohlhepp et al 2017 as well as high proportions of unsaturated and polyphenolic compounds probably derived from surface dissolved organic matter dom benk et al 2019 in metabolic cluster 4 the profiles of wells h42 and h43 were grouped high levels of fe2 3 mn2 4 toc and cl have been described in this cluster together with low concentrations of dissolved o2 and low redox potential kohlhepp et al 2017 finally metabolic profiles of wells h52 and h53 were classified as metabolic cluster 5 and as in h4 wells hydrochemistry has been characterized as an anoxic zone due to deficient levels of dissolved o2 however with high levels of k na and mg2 kohlhepp et al 2017 among the most discriminant metabolites compound 27 reached very high concentrations in wells h53 and h52 metabolic cluster 5 and was putatively identified as a streptogramin derivate streptogramins are cyclic peptides produced by streptomyces spp frequently isolated from soils gonzález et al 1999 hence the compound could originate from the streptomycetes identified in this zone of the hainich cz yan et al 2020 however the bacterial production of streptogramin does not explain the high levels found here compared to other clusters streptogramins have also been used as antibiotics for veterinary purposes their inclusion in animal feed generates manures rich in those antimicrobials since ongoing agricultural practices use animal residues to enhance soil conditions for crops streptogramin has been detected in swine manures and amended soils zhou et al 2010 zilles et al 2005 the high levels of streptogramin derivatives in the groundwater of metabolic cluster 5 with access to a shallow aquifer under agriculture activity indicates that molecules incorporated by above ground human activities could be transported through the soil and reach aquifer waters kaiser and kalbitz 2012 compound 46 putatively identified as 5 acetyloxy 6 6 11 trimethyl 16 oxo 15 oxapentacyclo 9 3 2 15 8 01 10 02 8 heptadec 12 ene 9 carboxylic acid a d ring modified gibberellin was found in high levels in h52 and h53 gibberellins are hormones that regulate vital processes such as germination growth and flowering in plants schwechheimer 2012 these hormones are widely used in agriculture to increase yield promote flowering and break dormancy rappaport 1980 therefore gibberellins can be incorporated into soils and transported to the aquifers due to these agricultural practices microorganisms isolated from rhizospheres also produce gibberellins affecting the development of their associated plants and could be an alternative source for the hormones detected in our study brown 1972 our metabolomic analysis of groundwater samples from the monitoring wells reveals five metabolic clusters these clusters indicate that the position of the monitoring wells in the hillslope and the aquifer system accessed see below are essentially shaping the metabolic profiles of the groundwater additionally the strong correlations with previously established microbial clusters suggest an active influence of microorganisms on metabolic profiles the structures of the putatively identified compounds reveal how plant metabolites and human practices impact the hainich cz further laboratory scale experiments could provide a detailed understanding of the metabolite microorganism network occurring in the groundwater 4 2 groundwater metabolomes reflect the aquifer system accessed our results show how the above ground recharging areas define the chemistry of the groundwater metabolic profiles groundwater from the uas displayed a significantly higher abundance compared to the las of metabolites from above ground human activities like agriculture and pasture we verified that the aquifer system accessed differentiates the metabolic profiles therefore we addressed how the distribution of the monitoring wells among the upper aquifer system uas and the lower aquifer system las impacts the metabolic profiles of groundwater samples fig 4 several compounds with elevated concentrations in uas were identified whereas only compound 8 was more abundant in las fig 5 compound 8 is a plant derived compound influenced mainly by the monitoring well h14 in the forest area considered the recharging area of las küsel et al 2016 these patterns are consistent with the configuration of the hainich cz where uas would be the immediate destiny of all chemical compounds in their path through the ground from the agricultural recharging areas uas is characterized by joints and dissolution pores and is classified as a midstream aquifer kohlhepp et al 2017 küsel et al 2016 uas would also accumulate a higher amount of compounds from above ground activities conversely las has more extensive fractures allowing higher water flows kohlhepp et al 2017 küsel et al 2016 thus resulting in a higher dilution of the metabolites agricultural practices generate a higher groundwater recharge than other land uses priyantha ranjan et al 2006 the changes in groundwater chemistry are then mostly related to the introduction of chemical products used in anthropogenic practices nonetheless the alteration in the activity of extracellular enzymes in the rhizosphere can also have a significant influence on those changes tischer et al 2019 as well as the enzymatic activities by bacterial communities in the seepage and shallow groundwater herrmann et al 2019 yan et al 2020 the metabolomic patterns observed between the upper and lower aquifer systems are thus not only the product of the above ground activity in the respective recharging areas but also the microbial and biochemical activity below ground the interplay between these factors is nicely reflected in the relationships observed in the untargeted data analysis figs 2 4 and 6 among the significantly more abundant compounds in uas fig 5 right is compound 70 putatively identified as betulin derivative such naturally occurring triterpenes are highly abundant in trees and grasses pai and joshi 2014 betulin derivatives have recently also been identified in the organic preparation stimulin altai agro gardens llc gorelova et al 2020 that promotes germination and yield in plants kosachev et al 2021 the use of betulin products in agriculture and the natural production of this triterpene in plants might be sources of these molecules once in the soil they could be altered by the microbial and enzymatic activities and transported further our metabolomic analysis confirmed that the aquifer accessed by the monitoring wells is essential in differentiating between groundwater s metabolic profiles the recharging areas provide the critical input signals differentiating these aquifer systems 4 3 groundwater metabolomes are not only aquifer specific depth is a significant factor in the discrimination of the groundwater chemistry as revealed by comparing metabolic profiles in wells located in the h4 and h5 sites these sites at the hillslope are influenced above ground by pasture and agricultural activities respectively and access different aquifer systems allowing joint analysis of horizontal and vertical transportation and transformation processes the multivariate analysis of wells h4 and h5 not only confirmed the differences between the metabolic profiles of groundwater from h41 and h51 metabolic clusters 2 and 3 from those of wells h42 h43 and h52 h53 metabolic clusters 4 and 5 but the components 2 revealed differences between wells in this last metabolic clusters between h42 h52 and h43 h53 fig 6a and 6b depth and aquifer system access are thus significant factors influencing the chemical composition in the biogeosphere the marked discrimination obtained between metabolic clusters 2 h41 and 4 h42 and h43 as well as 3 h51 and 5 h52 and h53 corresponds with their access to the uas and las the influence of depth on groundwater hydrochemistry has already been reported edmunds et al 2003 hanson and abraham 2009 hydrochemical differences have also been elucidated at the hainich cz between uas and las kohlhepp et al 2017 showing that the aquifer systems depth at our study site also has a substantial impact on the biogeochemical processes depth is not to be understood as purely the vertical distance from the surface but rather a factor defined by the aquifer systems even at deeper depths the metabolic differences observed between groundwater of wells h42 and h43 as well as between h52 and h53 having access to the uas could be attributed to input signals from the surface probably derived from pasture or agricultural practices like those mentioned in the previous analysis some studies have also found how concentrations of doc and dom into the vadose zone vary with the depth pabich et al 2001 roth et al 2019 those variations result from biogeochemical processes and the prevalence of metabolites in the respective aquifers the seven most discriminated metabolites of this analysis differentiate metabolic cluster 3 deeper aquifer system from cluster 5 upper aquifer system at site h5 besides compounds 117 70 and 68 helped discriminate monitoring wells in the vadose zone compound 117 for example was putatively identified as a derivative of catechol estrogens and was practically absent in groundwater of well h53 fig 7a and b the contribution of steroidal estrogens to the environment by farm animals has been determined to be potentially more significant than humans contribution shrestha et al 2012 socas rodríguez et al 2017 as already discussed livestock manure to amend soils for agriculture could also be the input source of this molecule in the groundwater interestingly this compound was not found in high levels in the groundwater of well h53 at the site where these practices occur three different scenarios could explain these low levels 1 there is a reduced vertical transport of input signals directly from above ground into h53 through the vadose zone probably generated by the already identified multi directional flow and the configuration of sloping bedrock strata in the hainich cze lehmann and totsche 2020 2 the microbial and enzymatic transformation of these compounds during the passage and 3 the fast supply of surface input signals and transformation products from 2 into the deeper aquifer system caused by the exchange of multi directional flow dynamics between the aeration and phreatic zones lehmann and totsche 2020 evidence for remaining vertical transport stems from compounds 70 and 68 they showed significantly higher levels in groundwater from well h53 compared to h51 and h52 located further down compound 68 was putatively identified as a benzoxazinone derivative benzoxazinones are metabolites commonly found in essential crops like maize wheat and rye and play a role as defense molecules when glycosylated sicker et al 2000 sicker and schulz 2002 these metabolites can be introduced in the upper vadose zone by incorporating cereal sprouts as an agricultural strategy to increase soil fertility krogh et al 2006 villagrasa et al 2009 this evidence allows us to speculate that compound 68 may originate from those agricultural practices occurring above ground of monitoring well h53 and that there is a particular vertical but slow transport our findings confirm that the singularity of the groundwater metabolic profiles from the monitoring wells at the hainich cz is aquifer specific and strongly influenced by the depth 4 4 general considerations our lc ms based untargeted metabolomics analysis of groundwater from monitoring wells located in a transect at the hainich cze revealed distinct differences among their metabolic profiles it allowed us to putatively identify key molecules that are responsible for the associations observed our results suggest that well location aquifer system access and aquifer depth are critical factors determining the differences among groundwater metabolomes well location determines the chemical nature of input signals from above ground that are incorporated into the aquifers in the forest area wells are predominantely provided with plant derived compounds and wells located in anthropogenically altered areas face the input of compounds related to human activities the depth and access to an upper or lower aquifer system also defines the chemical diversity of the groundwater the metabolome of upper aquifer systems may receive immediate input signals from plant and anthropogenic activities occurring on the surface conversely in lower aquifer systems the metabolome may be dominated by microorganism derived metabolites however further time series studies must be carried out that consider the multi directional flow dynamics in the hainich cze the correlations of our metabolic clusters with previous established microbial and biogeochemical clusters defined in the same sampling wells indicate the notorious role of microorganisms and their microenvironments in shaping groundwater s chemical nature metabolites found in groundwater might be not only the energy and nutrient source for microorganisms but also could be the product of their enzymatic transformations thus deciphering microbial and metabolome interactions in groundwater would be the ticket to elucidate the dynamics in the cz 5 conclusions this work shows that studying the chemical diversity of groundwater with an untargeted lc ms based metabolomic approach is a powerful approach that provides insights into understanding the intricate chemical networks occurring within the cz without the need to introduce external makers our publicly available data will serve as a basis for further identifying indicator metabolites that can be used as biomarkers these metabolites will serve as lead

15921,nitrous oxide is a highly potent greenhouse gas and one of the main contributors to the greenhouse gas footprint of wastewater treatment plants wwtp although nitrous oxide can be produced by abiotic reactions in these systems biological n2o production resulting from the imbalance of nitrous oxide production and reduction by microbial populations is the dominant cause the microbial populations responsible for the imbalance have not been clearly identified yet they are likely responsible for strong seasonal nitrous oxide patterns here we examined the seasonal nitrous oxide concentration pattern in avedøre wwtp alongside abiotic parameters the microbial community composition based on 16s rrna gene sequencing and already available metagenome assembled genomes mags we found that the wwtp parameters could not explain the observed pattern while no distinct community changes between periods of high and low dissolved nitrous oxide concentrations were determined we found 26 and 28 species with positive and negative correlations to the seasonal n2o concentrations respectively mags were identified for 124 species approximately 31 mean relative abundance of the community and analysis of their genomic nitrogen transformation potential could explain this correlation for four of the negatively correlated species other abundant species were also analysed for their nitrogen transformation potential interestingly only one full denitrifier candidatus dechloromonas phosphorivorans was identified 59 species had a nosz gene predicted with the majority identified as a clade ii nosz gene mainly from the phylum bacteroidota a correlation of mag derived functional guilds with the n2o concentration pattern showed that there was a small but significant negative correlation with nitrite oxidizing bacteria and species with a nosz gene n2o reducers den more research is required specifically long term activity measurements in relation to the n2o concentration to increase the resolution of these findings graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrous oxide full scale wwtp time series metagenomics genomes 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is a highly potent greenhouse gas with a warming potential 300 times higher than co2 ravishankara et al 2009 terada et al 2017 n2o is one of the main contributors to the greenhouse gas footprint of wastewater treatment plants wwtp daelman et al 2013 delre et al 2019 consequently mitigating n2o emissions would significantly reduce wwtp carbon footprints but to create mitigation strategies we need to identify and understand the n2o sources emission of n2o in wwtps is due to an imbalance in biotic and abiotic n2o production and complete consumption conthe et al 2019 n2o is an intermediate of denitrification where heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria den transform nitrate no3 to dinitrogen gas n2 fig 1 zumft 1997 the accumulation of n2o can be due to incomplete denitrification by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria where the last transformation of n2o to dinitrogen gas n2 via nitrous oxide reductase nos ec 1 7 2 4 fig 1 is not completed kampschreur et al 2009 additionally n2o is a by product from ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob converting the intermediate hydroxylamine to n2o using cytochrome p460 caranto et al 2016 another n2o production pathway of aob is nitrifier denitrification where the no2 produced by hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao ec 1 7 2 6 is reduced to n2o via nitrite reductase nir ec 1 7 2 1 and nitric oxide reductase nor ec 1 7 2 5 fig 1 caranto and lancaster 2017 domingo félez and smets 2019 wrage mönnig et al 2018 lastly n2o can also be produced via abiotic reactions between intermediates of nitrification and denitrification or by metal mediated reactions kampschreur et al 2011 soler jofra et al 2016 although part of the n2o emission from wwtps can originate from truncated denitrifiers lacking the nitrous oxide reductase gene nosz k00376 there are also many non denitrifying organisms that have nosz genes predicted in their genome conthe et al 2019 hallin et al 2018 sanford et al 2012 these organisms have the potential to reduce n2o and if their total nos activity is higher in the wwtp than the total combined activity of the nitric oxide reductase nor and cytochrome p460 then the wwtp would be a n2o sink the actual nos activity within a wwtp will depend on the genetic nosz potential and factors influencing the nos activity post translational and transcriptional regulation can cause an imbalance between n2o producing nor cytochrome p460 and n2o consuming nos enzymes liu et al 2013 lycus et al 2017 other factors that can influence the production consumption balance are oxygen concentration no2 accumulation a low c n ratio and storage polymer metabolism kampschreur et al 2008 law et al 2012 lu and chandran 2010 otte et al 1996 wunderlin et al 2012 short term influences are not the only factors influencing n2o emissions seasonal abiotic parameters have been suggested to influence long term n2o emissions such as temperature for wwtps located in temperate climates accumulation of nitrogen species e g no2 no3 nh4 and influent flow rate chen et al 2019 daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2021 vasilaki et al 2018 seasonal community composition variation and dynamics have also been suggested to influence n2o emissions in full scale wwtps daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2021 however most of the abundant organisms in wwtps are undescribed and have unknown functions a comprehensive database of wwtp specific high quality metagenome assembled genomes hq mags was made available only recently the midas genome database singleton et al 2021 this novel database might provide new insights into the until now unknown potential n2o producers and consumers responsible for n2o emissions here we examine the n2o production pattern and microbial community data of a full scale danish wwtp with nutrient removal spanning multiple years combined with the mag derived nitrogen transformation potential of the community we searched for correlations between the relative abundance of specific species and the n2o production pattern species showing a statistically significant correlation were cross referenced with the species representatives of the previously constructed midas genome database of hq mags singleton et al 2021 and positive identity hits were investigated for nitrogen transformation potential community members with a substantial abundance 0 1 relative abundance in the wwtp and microorganisms of special interest were also cross referenced to the species representatives of the hq mags to ensure no key n2o producer or consumer were omitted the genomic n2o reduction potential was investigated in more detail based on clade type and phylogeny additionally the cumulative relative abundance of the species that were categorised into functional guilds using metagenome based classification was compared to the n2o concentration pattern over three years this combined approach provided novel insights into the microbiology of nitrogen transformations in full scale wwtps although a direct correlation to the n2o production pattern could not be established 2 methods 2 1 plant process design and data collection the avedøre wwtp copenhagen denmark has biological nitrogen removal and enhanced biological phosphate removal ebpr with a capacity to treat approximately 70 000 m3 of wastewater daily under dry weather conditions serving approximately 350

screening grit removal and primary settlement before biological treatment with activated sludge four lines with two carousel reactors per line work in parallel and have alternating aeration and anoxic

al 2015 nierychlo et al 2020 briefly the activated sludge was sampled every one two weeks in the aerobic phase dna was extracted prepared and amplified as previously described stokholm bjerregaard et

filter with fastq maxee 1 0 dereplication of the sequences was done using usearch fastx uniques with sizeout unoise3 edgar 2017 with standard settings to generate exact amplicon sequence variants asvs the midas 4 reference database available at https www midasfieldguide org guide downloads combined with the sintax classifier with a confidence threshold of 0 8 edgar 2018 was used to assign taxonomy at the species level nierychlo et al 2020 for asvs without species level classification the taxonomy was assigned at the lowest available taxonomic level e g genus and these asvs were treated as separate species 2 3 classification of growing and non growing species in activated sludge the majority of species in activated sludge are found in the influent wastewater dottorini et al 2021 therefore by means of mass balances it is possible to identify whether these species are expected to grow or die in the activated sludge reactors in this study we assigned the species into growing and non growing groups based on the classification obtained by dottorini et al 2021 in dottorini et al 2021 the classification list is based on a mass balance between paired influent and activated sludge samples collected from 11 municipal wwtps across denmark although avedøre wwtp was not among the 11 wwtps used to obtain the classification list avedøre wwtp has very similar taxa process design and geographical location consequently it can be assumed that species will follow the same growth groups as described in dottorini et al 2021 species in wwtps with different process designs may not follow the same growth groups and mass balances should be conducted between paired influent and activated sludge samples the detailed mass balance methodology can be found elsewhere dottorini et al 2021 2 4 mag identification annotation and metabolic reconstruction a list of the abundant species relative read abundance of the 16s rrna gene of 0 1 at least twice in the sampling period in the avedøre wwtp

supplemental data s2 the 581 hq mag species representatives are defined as species at the whole genome level 95 ani and in cases where multiple genomes were recovered with 95 ani to each other the best genome most complete and least contaminated was selected as the representative genome for the species group singleton et al 2021 hq mags that represented an abundant 16s rrna gene defined species

enrichm v10 database incorporating a ko annotated uniref100 database suzek et al 2015 in some cases one 16s rrna gene defined midas species is associated with multiple mags for example tetrasphaera midas 5 is associated with 6 species representative mags this occurs due to the discrepancy between 16s rrna gene based and full genome based species definitions singleton et al 2022 in these instances we examined all the mags with a 98 6 identity hit of their 16s rrna genes to the 16s rrna gene defined midas species r v4 0 5 r core team 2019 https www r project org and r studio wickham et

by averaging the relative abundance of each asv the total reads per sample ranged from 32 481 to 124 155 the relative abundance of species was visualised with boxplots using the mean relative abundance for growing and non growing species differences in microbial community beta diversity were explored by non metric multidimensional scaling nmds using bray curtis dissimilarity distance in ampvis2 based on the n2o concentration profile during the 2017 2020 period two grouping periods have been described ad hoc using the mean n2o concentration as a threshold value the two groups are defined as high n2o concentration was higher than 0 138 g n m3 and low n2o concentration was lower than 0 138 g n m3 pearson correlations between species time series and n2o concentration were assessed with the hmisc package to approximate the data to a normal distribution species time series were transformed using a robust centered log ratio transformation and n2o concentration was squared root transformed prior correlation p values of the correlations were adjusted using the benjamini hochberg method to control the false discovery rate in multiple comparisons benjamini and hochberg 1995 3 results 3 1 avedøre wwtp showed a distinct seasonal n2o concentration pattern the full scale avedøre wwtp with biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal showed a distinct seasonal n2o production pattern with a recurring peak in the period between march and june fig 2a this was not concurrent with other operational parameters as the cod n ratio in the influent and nitrate in the effluent g n m3 were relatively constant over time fig 2a although there was a nitrate peak in the effluent in the winter of 2018 2019 it did not appear to influence the n2o concentration during this period the contrast between the relatively stable abiotic parameters and the strong n2o production pattern could indicate that the trend was caused by the microbial community present in the wwtp however the top 25 growing and non growing species fig 2b did not show many known n2o consumers or producers the growing species mainly consisted of known process critical species in wwtps with nutrient removal including biological p removal and many undescribed species nierychlo et al 2020 the non growing species were only present because of continuous addition via the influent wastewater dottorini et al 2021 and likely not very active in the transformation processes 3 2 the relative abundance of a subset of species was significantly positively or negatively correlated to the n2o concentration pattern we hypothesized that the strong n2o production pattern would be reflected by the relative read abundance of microbial community members of the avedøre wwtp we identified a total of 54 species 8 7 mean cumulative relative read abundance 39 growing species and 15 ambiguous species with a significant correlation to the seasonal n2o concentration pattern supplemental data s4 26

encoded denitrification genes directly associated with n2o production and reduction norbc k04561 k02305 and nosz k00376 respectively interestingly two other positively correlated species geothrix midas s 443 and rhodoferax midas s 320 also had the predicted genes nrfah and nirbd respectively which have been suggested to be involved in n2o production heo et al 2020 28 species were identified

the most abundant microorganisms had a highly diverse nitrogen transformation potential the nitrogen transformation potential of all abundant species with an identity hit with a hq mag from the midas

of the total cumulative relative read abundance 124 species had an identity hit with a species representative of the midas genome database together the species represented by a hq mag had a mean cumulative relative abundance of 31 4 of the 156 species representatives 108 had one or more nitrogen transformation genes supplemental data s5 an overview of the predicted nitrogen transformation genes of the top 33 most abundant species with an associated hq mag based on the mean relative abundance showed a varied nitrogen transformation potential fig 4b interestingly only one potential full denitrifier was predicted in the avedøre wwtp community ca dechloromonas phosphorivorans fig 4b although full denitrification potential was rare partial denitrification was not there were 81 species with at least one of the denitrification genes predicted including 11 potential n2o producers norbc predicted but no nosz and 59 potential n2o reducers nosz predicted but no norbc an interesting observation was that the hq mag of rhodanobacteraceae midas s 2835 had both a nirk and a nirs predicted suggested to be mutually exclusive jones et al 2013 indeed re annotation of the nirk and nirs genes with blast could only replicate this predicted function for nirk the closest hit for nirs was a c type cytochrome supplemental data s6 further study is required to identify the function of this predicted gene to investigate if the potential nob were correctly predicted a nxr a protein tree was made supplementary figure s3 nitrotoga species are well known nob boddicker and mosier 2018 but the hq mag of nitrotoga midas s 181 had only one of the two subunits predicted nxrb k00371 supplemental data s5 and was therefore not included in the protein tree the nxr a sequences of the two ns9 marine group species clustered with the cytoplasmic nxr a and nar g sequences olb14 midas s 849 clustered most closely to the periplasmic nitrite oxidoreductase sequences and nitrospira defluvii clustered most closely to nxr a sequences of other nitrospira species lastly stenotrophobacter midas s 1188 clustered near branches with a variety of functions although most sequences clustered near potential nxr a proteins experimental confirmation is required to functionally characterize these predicted proteins and determine if these species are actual nob 3 4 two novel nitrosomonas species might be important n2o producers with multiple n2o production pathways predicted although no aob were identified within the top 33 most abundant species represented by a hq mag singleton et al 2021 fig 4b they were present in lower abundance three nitrosomonas species were identified nitrosomonas midas s 139 nitrosomonas midas s 717 and nitrosomonas midas s 723 with a maximum relative abundance of 0 45 0 21 and 0 23 respectively fig 5 hq mags are available for nitrosomonas midas s 139 and nitrosomonas midas s 717 both species had the genes predicted of the canonical ammonia oxidation pathway ammonia monooxygenase amoabc k10944 k10945 k10946 and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao k10535 additionally nitrifier denitrification was predicted in both aob with nirs k and norbc identified one other species ottowia midas s 482 family comamonadaceae had hydroxylamine dehydrogenase but no ammonia monooxygenase predicted all three species were subsequently investigated for the potential to produce n2o from hydroxylamine with cytochrome p460 caranto et al 2016 kozlowski et al 2014 only the two nitrosomonas species were predicted to encode the cytochrome p460 fig 5 based on the genomic prediction of ottowia midas s 482 it appears that although this bacteria might be capable of converting hydroxylamine and or nitric oxide to nitrite via hao and nitrite to nitric oxide via nirs it does not appear to have the potential to produce n2o fig 1 and 5b 3 5 the majority of the nosz genes were predicted in hq mags from the bacteroidota phylum of the 124 species with an associated hq mag 59 had a nosz gene predicted in their genome supplemental data s5 however comparing the predicted nos sequences with nos sequences from known n2o reducers fig 6 we found a large evolutionary distance between the nos sequences of known n2o reducers blue dots and the predicted nos sequences from the species in the avedøre wwtp the known n2o reducers were predominantly species n 16 from the proteobacteria phylum with 12 out of 16 clustering together and all encoding a clade i nos it appeared that the protein tree was dominated by nos clade ii sequences with the majority of sequences from bacteroidota species 53 out of the 76 only one species rhodobacter midas s 63 clustered with nosz sequences of known n2o reducers to support the annotation of the hq mags a nos sequence from ignavibacterium album strain dsm 19864 sanford et al 2012 and from a flavobacterium species kim et al 2020 from the bacteroidota phylum was included in the tree these sequences clustered with the other sequences from bacteroidota showing that the nosz sequences of the bacteroidota were closely related to the characterised nos of i album dsm 19864 of the bacteria predicted to have a nosz gene only five had a mean abundance higher than 0 5 during the period sampled fig 6 the microorganisms with the highest abundance were a ca amarolinea midas s 1 chloroflexota rhodobacter midas s 63 proteobacteria ca dechloromonas phosphorivorans proteobacteria ca promineofilaceae midas s 461 chloroflexota and terrimonas midas s 390 bacteroidota with 1 4 0 9 0 9 0 6 and 0 5 mean abundance respectively 3 6 the n2o production pattern could not be explained by the relative abundance of species individually or grouped into functional guilds no individual member seemed to be solely responsible for the seasonal n2o concentration pattern fig 3 non growing species are not expected to take an active role in the process as expected there was a large overlap of the community between high and low n2o production periods fig 7 b and an absence of a correlation between the non growing microbial community and the n2o concentration g n m3 fig 7a although there was an overlap between high and low n2o production periods for the growing communities fig 7b a slight gradient was observed between the beta diversity of growing microbial communities and n2o concentration fig 7a additionally as shown in section 3 2 a number of individual species were positively correlated with n2o concentration level however it was possible that the cumulative relative abundance of a functional guild of microorganisms could show a better correlation to the n2o production pattern the functional guilds were based on the presence of key nitrogen transforming or n2o associated genes predicted in the hq mags the three aob and the full denitrifier ca dechloromonas phosphorivorans were grouped according to their functionality aob and complete den respectively the other species were grouped according to the presence of the nosz gene n2o reducers den or the presence of the norbc gene without a nosz gene n2o producers den the nob without a nosz gene but with a nxrab were grouped together as well nob there was a small but significant negative correlation ρ 0 37 p value 2 3 10 3 fig 8 supplemental data s7 with species grouped as potential nob n 3 nxrab but no nosz supplemental data s7 additionally species grouped as denn2o reducers n 59 ρ 0 48 p value 5 6 10 5 fig 8 supplemental data s7 encoding nosz had a significant negative correlation with the n2o concentration the relative read abundance of the denn2o producers encoding norbc but not nosz n 8 was dominated by one species from the saprospiraceae family olb8 midas s 29 fig 8 supplemental data s7 while at first glance there was a similar pattern in relative read abundance of this specific group and the seasonal n2o concentration the large time difference makes a direct metabolic correlation unlikely this was also reflected in the statistical analysis as no correlation ρ 3 0 10 3 p value 0 98 fig 8 supplemental data s7 in relative read abundance of the n2o producers was identified the full denitrifiers n 1 consisting only of the ca d phosphorivorans fig 8 supplemental data s7 showed an increased relative abundance during high n2o periods however the specific pattern in increase was not reflected in the n2o concentration pattern as it was not significantly correlated ρ 3 2 10 3 p value 0 98 supplemental data s7 lastly the relative read abundance of the other functional group able to produce n2o the aob amoabc and hao predicted n 3 had no significant correlation to the n2o concentration pattern ρ 9 6 10 2 p value 0 45 supplemental data s7 fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 the n2o concentration pattern appeared to be microbially mediated by several candidate species the abiotic and biotic influences on the n2o emissions in full scale wwtps have been studied at multiple locations across europe chen et al 2019 daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2020 2021 these four studies also report the highest n2o emission between march and may and additionally indicated a correlation between n2o seasonality and accumulation of nitrite and or nitrate these studies also acknowledge the relationship between the accumulation of intermediates and the microbial conversions such annual patterns in microbial conversions may also be determined by variations in the abundance of specific bacterial taxa a change in the activity of certain taxa due to environmental variations or a combination of the two we identified 54 species showing a strong recurrent seasonality and a significant correlation to the n2o concentration indicating that the abundance of certain taxa could be important the majority 39 of these taxa also belonged to the growing fraction which is assumed to be metabolically active and not only present due to continuous transportation by the influent wastewater dottorini et al 2021 of these growing species 15 had an identity hit with a hq mag so it was possible to investigate their genomic potential in greater detail terrimonas midas s 743 was the only positively correlated species with a hq mag that had denitrification genes predicted directly associated with both n2o production norbc and reduction nosz although species of this genus have been identified in partial denitrification communities it has not been directly associated with n2o emissions zhang et al 2021 four of the negatively associated species with a hq mag had the potential to reduce n2o the filamentous bacteria ca amarolinea midas s 1 the most abundant of the species has previously been suggested to have the potential for n2o reduction andersen et al 2019 additionally other species from the ca amarolinea genus have been reported to actively transcribe nosz in an anammox bioreactor community suenaga et al 2021 the other three species were bacteroidota saprospiraceae midas s 321 saprospiraceae midas s 862 and 37 13 midas s 1223 while saprospiraceae has been associated with n2o emissions in soils and anammox bioreactors jones et al 2013 2014 speth et al 2016 this is the first instance that members of the saprospiraceae family have been predicted as n2o reducers in a full scale wwtp community another closely related genus within the bacteroidota flavobacterium has also been associated with n2o production in wwtp suggesting that bacteroidota species might have a more important role than previously thought kim et al 2020 all four species are interesting candidates to investigate in more detail for their n2o reduction potential the majority 39 of the 54 of the significantly correlated species did not have an identity hit with a hq mag in the midas genome database singleton et al 2021 it is difficult to investigate the possible genetic traits these species had to explain a significant correlation and possible effect on the seasonal n2o concentration it also shows that many of the species in the wwtp remain functionally elusive and that we need to increase the number of hq mags to improve the resolution and increase our insight into species functionality however some species correlating with the seasonal n2o concentration but without a hq mag available had a genus level association with known partial denitrifiers although functional traits are often species specific petriglieri et al 2021 these species could be of special interest to study in more detail among the species with a significant correlation to the seasonal n2o concentration was a rhodobacter a genus harbouring known denitrifiers and with species previously correlated with n2o emissions in wwtps vieira et al 2019 other microbial lineages that significantly correlated with n2o emission ca competibacter ca accumulibacter and dechloromonas species have been shown to produce and reduce n2o in lab scale enrichment experiments roy et al 2021 vieira et al 2018 yoon et al 2016 while multiple ca accumulibacter and dechloromonas species had a hq mag available only ca d phosphorivorans had genes predicted directly associated with n2o production and reduction dechloromonas species have not been attributed with high n2o emissions under optimal growth conditions due to their high affinity to n2o suenaga et al 2019 yoon et al 2016 however non ideal conditions e g salt or alkaline stress may stimulate n2o production by this species han et al 2019 the species grouped as nob consisting of nitrospira defluvii nitrotoga midas s 181 and two predicted species with at least one copy of the nxrab gene had a statistically significant negative correlation with the seasonal n2o concentration this correlation was also observed by gruber et al 2021 although nob have no direct genes able to produce or reduce n2o they can be involved in complex symbiosis with aob or heterotrophic bacteria daims et al 2016 potentially affecting seasonal n2o concentration more research is required to elucidate the relationship between abundance of nob and the seasonal n2o concentration aob have been suggested as mainly responsible for n2o production in wwtps in several studies dias et al 2022 law et al 2012 wunderlin et al 2012 although the aob in the avedøre wwtp had the potential to produce n2o via both the hydroxylamine pathway and nitrifier denitrification caranto et al 2016 wrage mönnig et al 2018 no significant correlation was identified between their abundance and the n2o concentration peak such stable abundance in contrast to strongly changing seasonal n2o concentration was also observed by gruber et al 2021 more detailed research is required to determine if this discrepancy demonstrates that aob do not significantly contribute to the seasonal n2o production peak 4 2 denitrification seemed dominated by partial denitrifiers full denitrifiers are often assumed to dominate the denitrification process in wwtp nielsen and mcmahon 2014 however in our study of avedøre wwtp we only identified one full denitrifier no3 to n2 lu et al 2014 zumft 1997 ca d phosphorivorans this is also reflected in the midas genome database of species from wwtps all over denmark while singleton et al 2021 identified 21 full denitrifiers they identified manifold more hq mags with at least one gene of the pathway predicted the variety in denitrification gene combinations is well established and seen in many natural and engineered environments baker et al 2015 graf et al 2014 lu et al 2014 division of labor between different species has additionally been shown in denitrifying enrichment cultures vieira et al 2018 wang et al 2021 suggesting that the denitrifying potential and as such the n2o production or reduction potential is likely impacted by the community structure 4 3 the high n2o reduction potential mainly identified in bacteroidota species was dominated by clade ii nosz the majority of the nosz genes were predicted in members of the bacteroidota the importance of this phylum in n2o reduction has been observed in soils jones et al 2014 while functionally verified n2o reducers are predominantly proteobacteria conthe et al 2018 hallin et al 2018 suenaga et al 2018 the many undiscovered n2o reducers from other phyla might play an important role in natural and engineered environments jones et al 2013 sanford et al 2012 singleton et al 2021 the majority of clade i nosz gene sequences have been identified in proteobacteria and are normally associated with denitrifying organisms hallin et al 2018 sanford et al 2012 yoon et al 2016 interestingly this was not observed in our analysis although there were three hq mags with a denitrifier clade i nosz gene predicted none of these hq mags had the full denitrification pathway predicted additionally none of these species had a significant correlation with the seasonal n2o concentration the majority 69 of the 72 of the nosz sequences predicted within the avedøre wwtp community were clade ii although this has been observed in other environments jones et al 2014 kim et al 2020 orellana et al 2014 suenaga et al 2021 this is the first study showing this overwhelming dominance of clade ii over clade i ratio 25 7 it could be that the proposed higher oxygen tolerance and affinity for n2o of the clade ii nos was selective for this community yoon et al 2016 4 4 other factors than the genomic n2o production or reduction potential predict the n2o concentration in the avedøre wwtp the community in avedøre wwtp had a large genetic potential to reduce n2o during the period studied other studies have shown that genomic n2o reduction potential and n2o emission level are correlated jones et al 2014 vieira et al 2018 with high nosz values relating to low n2o emissions in our dataset there were a high number of hq mags with a nosz predicted approximately 45 of the hq mags available suggesting a high genomic potential to reduce n2o this would imply that other factors than the genetic potential determine the n2o concentration in the wwtp however as we do not cover the entire community with the midas genome database long term monitoring of the nosz gene in the wwtp will be required to examine the nosz potential of the community without a hq mag many factors can influence the actual n2o reduction activity in full scale wwtps with dissolved oxygen concentrations often suggested as one of the key inhibitors for n2o reduction law et al 2012 pan et al 2013 suenaga et al 2018 the seasonal change in temperature can affect the dissolved oxygen concentration in the wwtp as well as the microbial conversion rates but its effect should be expected to be observed in both spring and fall additionally previous studies have identified only weak to no correlation between temperature as a parameter and n2o emissions ahn et al 2010 chen et al 2019 suggesting that temperature was not the dominant influencing factor another key parameter in n2o reduction is the electron availability as all enzymatic conversions in the denitrification pathway require electrons electron competition within the pathway can decrease in n2o reduction activity conthe et al 2018 felgate et al 2012 however the cod n ratio in the influent and the cod quality in the effluent remained stable throughout the studied period supplementary data s1 this does not exclude the possibility that the type of electron donor or carbon source shown to severely impact the n2o reductase activity itokawa et al 2001 pan et al 2013 qi et al 2022 ribera guardia et al 2014 2016 changed over the year table 1 n2o production can occur in both the aerobic and in the anoxic phase by aob and truncated denitrifiers song et al 2020 as n2o reduction only occurs during the anoxic phase kampschreur et al 2009 suenaga et al 2018 part of the produced n2o will directly be sparged out of the liquid during the aerobic phase although aerobic denitrification may occur robertson et al 1989 1995 and produce n2o the majority of the aerobically produced n2o is produced by aob tallec et al 2008 low dissolved oxygen concentrations and high nitrite concentrations have been shown to stimulate n2o production by aob kampschreur et al 2009 kozlowski et al 2016 as stated above if the seasonal temperature effect on dissolved oxygen affected n2o production by aob this would be expected to occur in both spring and fall while no nitrite concentrations were measured in the period studied it might be an interesting additional parameter to measure in future studies future work is required to elucidate the factors influencing seasonal under utilization of the high genetic n2o reduction potential of the community although this work provides a list of interesting candidates that could act as a n2o sink within avedøre wwtp many species are novel with little to no knowledge of their potential function meta omics data combined with n2o reductase activity assays measured with activated sludge throughout the year s could provide more insight into the physiology of n2o sink species this could result in mitigation strategies controlling species composition and n2o production and reduction activity 5 conclusions we found a recurrent strong seasonal n2o concentration pattern with spring peaks and autumn lows from avedøre wwtp over 3 years the relative read abundance of 54 species was significantly correlated to the n2o concentrations either positively or negatively partial denitrifiers instead of complete denitrifiers appeared to dominate the genetic denitrification potential of the community the cumulative abundances of n2o reducers and nob had a significant negative correlation to n2o concentrations clade ii nosz genes primarily found in bacteroidota were more common than clade i nosz genes in the hq mags multiple novel potential n2o sink species have been identified for further study overall there was some correlation between community structure and n2o concentration but activity measurements of specific bacteria are needed to understand the correlation in greater detail declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the authors wish to thank the avedøre wwtp for sharing the operational data and all the student

15921,nitrous oxide is a highly potent greenhouse gas and one of the main contributors to the greenhouse gas footprint of wastewater treatment plants wwtp although nitrous oxide can be produced by abiotic reactions in these systems biological n2o production resulting from the imbalance of nitrous oxide production and reduction by microbial populations is the dominant cause the microbial populations responsible for the imbalance have not been clearly identified yet they are likely responsible for strong seasonal nitrous oxide patterns here we examined the seasonal nitrous oxide concentration pattern in avedøre wwtp alongside abiotic parameters the microbial community composition based on 16s rrna gene sequencing and already available metagenome assembled genomes mags we found that the wwtp parameters could not explain the observed pattern while no distinct community changes between periods of high and low dissolved nitrous oxide concentrations were determined we found 26 and 28 species with positive and negative correlations to the seasonal n2o concentrations respectively mags were identified for 124 species approximately 31 mean relative abundance of the community and analysis of their genomic nitrogen transformation potential could explain this correlation for four of the negatively correlated species other abundant species were also analysed for their nitrogen transformation potential interestingly only one full denitrifier candidatus dechloromonas phosphorivorans was identified 59 species had a nosz gene predicted with the majority identified as a clade ii nosz gene mainly from the phylum bacteroidota a correlation of mag derived functional guilds with the n2o concentration pattern showed that there was a small but significant negative correlation with nitrite oxidizing bacteria and species with a nosz gene n2o reducers den more research is required specifically long term activity measurements in relation to the n2o concentration to increase the resolution of these findings graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrous oxide full scale wwtp time series metagenomics genomes 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is a highly potent greenhouse gas with a warming potential 300 times higher than co2 ravishankara et al 2009 terada et al 2017 n2o is one of the main contributors to the greenhouse gas footprint of wastewater treatment plants wwtp daelman et al 2013 delre et al 2019 consequently mitigating n2o emissions would significantly reduce wwtp carbon footprints but to create mitigation strategies we need to identify and understand the n2o sources emission of n2o in wwtps is due to an imbalance in biotic and abiotic n2o production and complete consumption conthe et al 2019 n2o is an intermediate of denitrification where heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria den transform nitrate no3 to dinitrogen gas n2 fig 1 zumft 1997 the accumulation of n2o can be due to incomplete denitrification by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria where the last transformation of n2o to dinitrogen gas n2 via nitrous oxide reductase nos ec 1 7 2 4 fig 1 is not completed kampschreur et al 2009 additionally n2o is a by product from ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob converting the intermediate hydroxylamine to n2o using cytochrome p460 caranto et al 2016 another n2o production pathway of aob is nitrifier denitrification where the no2 produced by hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao ec 1 7 2 6 is reduced to n2o via nitrite reductase nir ec 1 7 2 1 and nitric oxide reductase nor ec 1 7 2 5 fig 1 caranto and lancaster 2017 domingo félez and smets 2019 wrage mönnig et al 2018 lastly n2o can also be produced via abiotic reactions between intermediates of nitrification and denitrification or by metal mediated reactions kampschreur et al 2011 soler jofra et al 2016 although part of the n2o emission from wwtps can originate from truncated denitrifiers lacking the nitrous oxide reductase gene nosz k00376 there are also many non denitrifying organisms that have nosz genes predicted in their genome conthe et al 2019 hallin et al 2018 sanford et al 2012 these organisms have the potential to reduce n2o and if their total nos activity is higher in the wwtp than the total combined activity of the nitric oxide reductase nor and cytochrome p460 then the wwtp would be a n2o sink the actual nos activity within a wwtp will depend on the genetic nosz potential and factors influencing the nos activity post translational and transcriptional regulation can cause an imbalance between n2o producing nor cytochrome p460 and n2o consuming nos enzymes liu et al 2013 lycus et al 2017 other factors that can influence the production consumption balance are oxygen concentration no2 accumulation a low c n ratio and storage polymer metabolism kampschreur et al 2008 law et al 2012 lu and chandran 2010 otte et al 1996 wunderlin et al 2012 short term influences are not the only factors influencing n2o emissions seasonal abiotic parameters have been suggested to influence long term n2o emissions such as temperature for wwtps located in temperate climates accumulation of nitrogen species e g no2 no3 nh4 and influent flow rate chen et al 2019 daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2021 vasilaki et al 2018 seasonal community composition variation and dynamics have also been suggested to influence n2o emissions in full scale wwtps daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2021 however most of the abundant organisms in wwtps are undescribed and have unknown functions a comprehensive database of wwtp specific high quality metagenome assembled genomes hq mags was made available only recently the midas genome database singleton et al 2021 this novel database might provide new insights into the until now unknown potential n2o producers and consumers responsible for n2o emissions here we examine the n2o production pattern and microbial community data of a full scale danish wwtp with nutrient removal spanning multiple years combined with the mag derived nitrogen transformation potential of the community we searched for correlations between the relative abundance of specific species and the n2o production pattern species showing a statistically significant correlation were cross referenced with the species representatives of the previously constructed midas genome database of hq mags singleton et al 2021 and positive identity hits were investigated for nitrogen transformation potential community members with a substantial abundance 0 1 relative abundance in the wwtp and microorganisms of special interest were also cross referenced to the species representatives of the hq mags to ensure no key n2o producer or consumer were omitted the genomic n2o reduction potential was investigated in more detail based on clade type and phylogeny additionally the cumulative relative abundance of the species that were categorised into functional guilds using metagenome based classification was compared to the n2o concentration pattern over three years this combined approach provided novel insights into the microbiology of nitrogen transformations in full scale wwtps although a direct correlation to the n2o production pattern could not be established 2 methods 2 1 plant process design and data collection the avedøre wwtp copenhagen denmark has biological nitrogen removal and enhanced biological phosphate removal ebpr with a capacity to treat approximately 70 000 m3 of wastewater daily under dry weather conditions serving approximately 350 000 population equivalents pe key parameters measured during the studied period are shown in fig 2 a and other operational parameters are shown in supplemental data s1 mainstream treatment consists of screening grit removal and primary settlement before biological treatment with activated sludge four lines with two carousel reactors per line work in parallel and have alternating aeration and anoxic periods aeration is controlled by star control and is based on the ammonia concentration the average effluent total n was 4 7 2 1 g n m3 during the period 2017 2020 supplemental data s1 nitrous oxide was measured in the liquid phase in carrousel reactor 1 and 3 using two dissolved n2o sensors unisense environment a s denmark per line only line 3 was considered for this study as line 1 changed conditions during the period studied 2 2 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and bioinformatic analysis activated sludge biomass was sampled within the midas project as previously described mcilroy et al 2015 nierychlo et al 2020 briefly the activated sludge was sampled every one two weeks in the aerobic phase dna was extracted prepared and amplified as previously described stokholm bjerregaard et

filter with fastq maxee 1 0 dereplication of the sequences was done using usearch fastx uniques with sizeout unoise3 edgar 2017 with standard settings to generate exact amplicon sequence variants asvs the midas 4 reference database available at https www midasfieldguide org guide downloads combined with the sintax classifier with a confidence threshold of 0 8 edgar 2018 was used to assign taxonomy at the species level nierychlo et al 2020 for asvs without species level classification the taxonomy was assigned at the lowest available taxonomic level e g genus and these asvs were treated as separate species 2 3 classification of growing and non growing species in activated sludge the majority of species in activated sludge are found in the influent wastewater dottorini et al 2021 therefore by means of mass balances it is possible to identify whether these species are expected to grow or die in the activated sludge reactors in this study we assigned the species into growing and non growing groups based on the classification obtained by dottorini et al 2021 in dottorini et al 2021 the classification list is based on a mass balance between paired influent and activated sludge samples collected from 11 municipal wwtps across denmark although avedøre wwtp was not among the 11 wwtps used to obtain the classification list avedøre wwtp has very similar taxa process design and geographical location consequently it can be assumed that species will follow the same growth groups as described in dottorini et al 2021 species in wwtps with different process designs may not follow the same growth groups and mass balances should be conducted between paired influent and activated sludge samples the detailed mass balance methodology can be found elsewhere dottorini et al 2021 2 4 mag identification annotation and metabolic reconstruction a list of the abundant species relative read abundance of the 16s rrna gene of 0 1 at least twice in the sampling period in the avedøre wwtp was made resulting in 367 16s rrna gene defined species this species list was cross referenced with the 581 hq mags species representatives previously recovered from danish wwtps singleton et al 2021 supplemental data s2 the 581 hq mag species representatives are defined as species at the whole genome level 95 ani and in cases where multiple genomes were recovered with 95 ani to each other the best genome most complete and least contaminated was selected as the representative genome for the species group singleton et al 2021 hq mags that represented an abundant 16s rrna gene defined species in avedøre wwtp with 98 6 average nucleotide identity yarza et al 2014 across the full length 16s rrna gene were annotated using enrichm v0 5 0 https github com geronimp enrichm annotate with the enrichm v10 database incorporating a ko annotated uniref100 database suzek et al 2015 in some cases one 16s rrna gene defined midas species is associated with multiple mags for example tetrasphaera midas 5 is associated with 6 species representative mags this occurs due to the discrepancy between 16s rrna gene based and full genome based species definitions singleton et al 2022 in these instances we examined all the mags with a 98 6 identity hit of their 16s rrna genes to the 16s rrna gene defined midas species r v4 0 5 r core team 2019 https www r project org and r studio wickham et

by averaging the relative abundance of each asv the total reads per sample ranged from 32 481 to 124 155 the relative abundance of species was visualised with boxplots using the mean relative abundance for growing and non growing species differences in microbial community beta diversity were explored by non metric multidimensional scaling nmds using bray curtis dissimilarity distance in ampvis2 based on the n2o concentration profile during the 2017 2020 period two grouping periods have been described ad hoc using the mean n2o concentration as a threshold value the two groups are defined as high n2o concentration was higher than 0 138 g n m3 and low n2o concentration was lower than 0 138 g n m3 pearson correlations between species time series and n2o concentration were assessed with the hmisc package to approximate the data to a normal distribution species time series were transformed using a robust centered log ratio transformation and n2o concentration was squared

1995 3 results 3 1 avedøre wwtp showed a distinct seasonal n2o concentration pattern the full scale avedøre wwtp with biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal showed a distinct seasonal n2o production pattern with a recurring peak in the period between march and june fig 2a this was not concurrent with other operational parameters as the cod n ratio in the influent and nitrate in the effluent g n m3 were relatively constant over time fig 2a although there was a nitrate peak in the effluent in the winter of 2018 2019 it did not appear to influence the n2o concentration during this period the contrast between the relatively stable abiotic parameters and the strong n2o production pattern could indicate that the trend was caused by the microbial community present in the wwtp however the top 25 growing and non growing species fig 2b did not show many known n2o consumers or producers the growing species mainly consisted of known process critical species in wwtps with nutrient removal including biological p removal and many undescribed species nierychlo et al 2020 the non growing species were only present because of continuous addition via the influent wastewater dottorini et al 2021 and likely not very active in the transformation processes 3 2 the relative abundance of a subset of species was significantly positively or negatively correlated to the n2o concentration pattern we hypothesized that the strong n2o production pattern would be reflected by the relative read abundance of microbial community members of the avedøre wwtp we identified a total of 54 species 8 7 mean cumulative relative read abundance 39 growing species and 15 ambiguous species with a significant correlation to the seasonal n2o concentration pattern supplemental data s4 26 species had a significant positive correlation ρ 0 4 p value 0 01 supplemental data s4 fig 3 the most abundant positively correlated species was sja 25 midas s 31 bacteroidota with an average relative abundance between 0 1 and 0 4 but two peaks around 1 2 relative abundance supplemental figure s1 the mean relative abundance of all other positively correlated species was below 1 with most species around 0 2 supplemental figure s1 five of the 26 species 0 8 mean cumulative relative read abundance had an identity hit 98 6 nucleotide identity with a species representative in the midas genome database and were subsequently investigated for their nitrogen transformation potential while all five species had nitrogen transformation genes predicted fig 4 a green dot only terrimonas midas s 743 encoded denitrification genes directly associated with n2o production and reduction norbc k04561 k02305 and nosz k00376 respectively interestingly two other positively correlated species geothrix midas s 443 and rhodoferax midas s 320 also had the predicted genes nrfah and nirbd respectively which have been suggested to be involved in n2o production heo et al 2020 28 species were identified with a significant negative correlation ρ 0 4 p value 0 01 supplemental data s4 with ca amarolinea midas s 1 supplemental figure s2 showing the highest relative read abundance ca amarolinea midas s 1 had a read abundance of approximately 2 5 throughout the sampling period except for a peak of 15 around the end of september 2018 and a peak of 5 around february 2020 supplemental figure s2 of the 23 species nine 2 9 mean cumulative relative read abundance had an identity hit with a species representative of the midas genome database analysis of these genomes showed that all species had nitrogen transformation genes predicted fig 4a red dot four species ca amarolinea midas s 1 saprospiraceae midas s 321 saprospiraceae midas s 862 and 37 13 midas s 1223 bacteroidota had a nosz gene predicted without the norbc genes indicating those species as potential n2o reducers of those four species only ca amarolinea midas s 1 had denitrification gene predicted narghi in combination with the nosz 3 3 the most abundant microorganisms had a highly diverse nitrogen transformation potential the nitrogen transformation potential of all abundant species with an identity hit with a hq mag from the midas genome database singleton et al 2021 was additionally investigated species considered significantly abundant had a relative read abundance of at least 0 1 twice a year of the 367 abundant species 80 3 of the total cumulative relative read abundance 124 species had an identity hit with a species representative of the midas genome database together the species represented by a hq mag had a mean cumulative relative abundance of 31 4 of the 156 species representatives 108 had one or more nitrogen transformation genes supplemental data s5 an overview of the predicted nitrogen transformation genes of the top 33 most abundant species with an associated hq mag based on the mean relative abundance showed a varied nitrogen transformation potential fig 4b interestingly only one potential full denitrifier was predicted in the avedøre wwtp community ca dechloromonas phosphorivorans fig 4b although full denitrification potential was rare partial denitrification was not there were 81 species with at least one of the denitrification genes predicted including 11 potential n2o producers norbc predicted but no nosz and 59 potential n2o reducers nosz predicted but no norbc an interesting observation was that the hq mag of rhodanobacteraceae midas s 2835 had both a nirk and a nirs predicted suggested to be mutually exclusive jones et al 2013 indeed re annotation of the nirk and nirs genes with blast could only replicate this predicted function for nirk the closest hit for nirs was a c type cytochrome supplemental data s6 further study is required to identify the function of this predicted gene to investigate if the potential nob were correctly predicted a nxr a protein tree was made supplementary figure s3 nitrotoga species are well known nob boddicker and mosier 2018 but the hq mag of nitrotoga midas s 181 had only one of the two subunits predicted nxrb k00371 supplemental data s5 and was therefore not included in the protein tree the nxr a sequences of the two ns9 marine group species clustered with the cytoplasmic nxr a and nar g sequences olb14 midas s 849 clustered most closely to the periplasmic nitrite oxidoreductase sequences and nitrospira defluvii clustered most closely to nxr a sequences of other nitrospira species lastly stenotrophobacter midas s 1188 clustered near branches with a variety of functions although most sequences clustered near potential nxr a proteins experimental confirmation is required to functionally characterize these predicted proteins and determine if these species are actual nob 3 4 two novel nitrosomonas species might be important n2o producers with multiple n2o production pathways predicted although no aob were identified within the top 33 most abundant species represented by a hq mag singleton et al 2021 fig 4b they were present in lower abundance three nitrosomonas species were identified nitrosomonas midas s 139 nitrosomonas midas s 717 and nitrosomonas midas s 723 with a maximum relative abundance of 0 45 0 21 and 0 23 respectively fig 5 hq mags are available for nitrosomonas midas s 139 and nitrosomonas midas s 717 both species had the genes predicted of the canonical ammonia oxidation pathway ammonia monooxygenase amoabc k10944 k10945 k10946 and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao k10535 additionally nitrifier denitrification was predicted in both aob with nirs k and norbc identified one other species ottowia midas s 482 family comamonadaceae had hydroxylamine dehydrogenase but no ammonia monooxygenase predicted all three species were subsequently investigated for the potential to produce n2o from hydroxylamine with cytochrome p460 caranto et al 2016 kozlowski et al 2014 only the two nitrosomonas species were predicted to encode the cytochrome p460 fig 5 based on the genomic prediction of ottowia midas s 482 it appears that although this bacteria might be capable of converting hydroxylamine and or nitric oxide to nitrite via hao and nitrite to nitric oxide via nirs it does not appear to have the potential to produce n2o fig 1 and 5b 3 5 the majority of the nosz genes were predicted in hq mags from the bacteroidota phylum of the 124 species with an associated hq mag 59 had a nosz gene predicted in their genome supplemental data s5 however comparing the predicted nos sequences with nos sequences from known n2o reducers fig 6 we found a large evolutionary distance between the nos sequences of known n2o reducers blue dots and the predicted nos sequences from the species in the avedøre wwtp the known n2o reducers were predominantly species n 16 from the proteobacteria phylum with 12 out of 16 clustering together and all encoding a clade i nos it appeared that the protein tree was dominated by nos clade ii sequences with the majority of sequences from bacteroidota species 53 out of the 76 only one species rhodobacter midas s 63 clustered with nosz sequences of known n2o reducers to support the annotation of the hq mags a nos sequence from ignavibacterium album strain dsm 19864 sanford et al 2012 and from a flavobacterium species kim et al 2020 from the bacteroidota phylum was included in the tree these sequences clustered with the other sequences from bacteroidota showing that the nosz sequences of the bacteroidota were closely related to the characterised nos of i album dsm 19864 of the bacteria predicted to have a nosz gene only five had a mean abundance higher than 0 5 during the period sampled fig 6 the microorganisms with the highest abundance were a ca amarolinea midas s 1 chloroflexota rhodobacter midas s 63 proteobacteria ca dechloromonas phosphorivorans proteobacteria ca promineofilaceae midas s 461 chloroflexota and terrimonas midas s 390 bacteroidota with 1 4 0 9 0 9 0 6 and 0 5 mean abundance respectively 3 6 the n2o production pattern could not be explained by the relative abundance of species individually or grouped into functional guilds no individual member seemed to be solely responsible for the seasonal n2o concentration pattern fig 3 non growing species are not expected to take an active role in the process as expected there was a large overlap of the community between high and low n2o production periods fig 7 b and an absence of a correlation between the non growing microbial community and the n2o concentration g n m3 fig 7a although there was an overlap between high and low n2o production periods for the growing communities fig 7b a slight gradient was observed between the beta diversity of growing microbial communities and n2o concentration fig 7a additionally as shown in section 3 2 a number of individual species were positively correlated with n2o concentration level however it was possible that the cumulative relative abundance of a functional guild of microorganisms could show a better correlation to the n2o production pattern the functional guilds were based on the presence of key nitrogen transforming or n2o associated genes predicted in the hq mags the three aob and the full denitrifier ca dechloromonas phosphorivorans were grouped according to their functionality aob and complete den respectively the other species were grouped according to the presence of the nosz gene n2o reducers den or the presence of the norbc gene without a nosz gene n2o producers den the nob without a nosz gene but with a nxrab were grouped together as well nob there was a small but significant negative correlation ρ 0 37 p value 2 3 10 3 fig 8 supplemental data s7 with species grouped as potential nob n 3 nxrab but no nosz supplemental data s7 additionally species grouped as denn2o reducers n 59 ρ 0 48 p value 5 6 10 5 fig 8 supplemental data s7 encoding nosz had a significant negative correlation with the n2o concentration the relative read abundance of the denn2o producers encoding norbc but not nosz n 8 was dominated by one species from the saprospiraceae family olb8 midas s 29 fig 8 supplemental data s7 while at first glance there was a similar pattern in relative read abundance of this specific group and the seasonal n2o concentration the large time difference makes a direct metabolic correlation unlikely this was also reflected in the statistical analysis as no correlation ρ 3 0 10 3 p value 0 98 fig 8 supplemental data s7 in relative read abundance of the n2o producers was identified the full denitrifiers n 1 consisting only of the ca d phosphorivorans fig 8 supplemental data s7 showed an increased relative abundance during high n2o periods however the specific pattern in increase was not reflected in the n2o concentration pattern as it was not significantly correlated ρ 3 2 10 3 p value 0 98 supplemental data s7 lastly the relative read abundance of the other functional group able to produce n2o the aob amoabc and hao predicted n 3 had no significant correlation to the n2o concentration pattern ρ 9 6 10 2 p value 0 45 supplemental data s7 fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 the n2o concentration pattern appeared to be microbially mediated by several candidate species the abiotic and biotic influences on the n2o emissions in full scale wwtps have been studied at multiple locations across europe chen et al 2019 daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2020 2021 these four studies also report the highest n2o emission between march and may and additionally indicated a correlation between n2o seasonality and accumulation of nitrite and or nitrate these studies also acknowledge the relationship between the accumulation of intermediates and the microbial conversions such annual patterns in microbial conversions may also be determined by variations in the abundance of specific bacterial taxa a change in the activity of certain taxa due to environmental variations or a combination of the two we identified 54 species showing a strong recurrent seasonality and a significant correlation to the n2o concentration indicating that the abundance of certain taxa could be important the majority 39 of these taxa also belonged to the growing fraction which is assumed to be metabolically active and not only present due to continuous transportation by the influent wastewater dottorini et al 2021 of these growing species 15 had an identity hit with a hq mag so it was possible to investigate their genomic potential in greater detail terrimonas midas s 743 was the only positively correlated species with a hq mag that had denitrification genes predicted directly associated with both n2o production norbc and reduction nosz although species of this genus have been identified in partial denitrification communities it has not been directly associated with n2o emissions zhang et al 2021 four of the negatively associated species with a hq mag had the potential to reduce n2o the filamentous bacteria ca amarolinea midas s 1 the most abundant of the species has previously been suggested to have the potential for n2o reduction andersen et al 2019 additionally other species from the ca amarolinea genus have been reported to actively transcribe nosz in an anammox bioreactor community suenaga et al 2021 the other three species were bacteroidota saprospiraceae midas s 321 saprospiraceae midas s 862 and 37 13 midas s 1223 while saprospiraceae has been associated with n2o emissions in soils and anammox bioreactors jones et al 2013 2014 speth et al 2016 this is the first instance that members of the saprospiraceae family have been predicted as n2o reducers in a full scale wwtp community another closely related genus within the bacteroidota flavobacterium has also been associated with n2o production in wwtp suggesting that bacteroidota species might have a more important role than previously thought kim et al 2020 all four species are interesting candidates to investigate in more detail for their n2o reduction potential the majority 39 of the 54 of the significantly correlated species did not have an identity hit with a hq mag in the midas genome database singleton et al 2021 it is difficult to investigate the possible genetic traits these species had to explain a significant correlation and possible effect on the seasonal n2o concentration it also shows that many of the species in the wwtp remain functionally elusive and that we need to increase the number of hq mags to improve the resolution and increase our insight into species functionality however some species correlating with the seasonal n2o concentration but without a hq mag available had a genus level association with known partial denitrifiers although functional traits are often species specific petriglieri et al 2021 these species could be of special interest to study in more detail among the species with a significant correlation to the seasonal n2o concentration was a rhodobacter a genus harbouring known denitrifiers and with species previously correlated with n2o emissions in wwtps vieira et al 2019 other microbial lineages that significantly correlated with n2o emission ca competibacter ca accumulibacter and dechloromonas species have been shown to produce and reduce n2o in lab scale enrichment experiments roy et al 2021 vieira et al 2018 yoon et al 2016 while multiple ca accumulibacter and dechloromonas species had a hq mag available only ca d phosphorivorans had genes predicted directly associated with n2o production and reduction dechloromonas species have not been attributed with high n2o emissions under optimal growth conditions due to their high affinity to n2o suenaga et al 2019 yoon et al 2016 however non ideal conditions e g salt or alkaline stress may stimulate n2o production by this species han et al 2019 the species grouped as nob consisting of nitrospira defluvii nitrotoga midas s 181 and two predicted species with at least one copy of the nxrab gene had a statistically significant negative correlation with the seasonal n2o concentration this correlation was also observed by gruber et al 2021 although nob have no direct genes able to produce or reduce n2o they can be involved in complex symbiosis with aob or heterotrophic bacteria daims et al 2016 potentially affecting seasonal n2o concentration more research is required to elucidate the relationship between abundance of nob and the seasonal n2o concentration aob have been suggested as mainly responsible for n2o production in wwtps in several studies dias et al 2022 law et al 2012 wunderlin et al 2012 although the aob in the avedøre wwtp had the potential to produce n2o via both the hydroxylamine pathway and nitrifier denitrification caranto et al 2016 wrage mönnig et al 2018 no significant correlation was identified between their abundance and the n2o concentration peak such stable abundance in contrast to strongly changing seasonal n2o concentration was also observed by gruber et al 2021 more detailed research is required to determine if this discrepancy demonstrates that aob do not significantly contribute to the seasonal n2o production peak 4 2 denitrification seemed dominated by partial denitrifiers full denitrifiers are often assumed to dominate the denitrification process in wwtp nielsen and mcmahon 2014 however in our study of avedøre wwtp we only identified one full denitrifier no3 to n2 lu et al 2014 zumft 1997 ca d phosphorivorans this is also reflected in the midas genome database of species from wwtps all over denmark while singleton et al 2021 identified 21 full denitrifiers they identified manifold more hq mags with at least one gene of the pathway predicted the variety in denitrification gene combinations is well established and seen in many natural and engineered environments baker et al 2015 graf et al 2014 lu et al 2014 division of labor between different species has additionally been shown in denitrifying enrichment cultures vieira et al 2018 wang et al 2021 suggesting that the denitrifying potential and as such the n2o production or reduction potential is likely impacted by the community structure 4 3 the high n2o reduction potential mainly identified in bacteroidota species was dominated by clade ii nosz the majority of the nosz genes were predicted in members of the bacteroidota the importance of this phylum in n2o reduction has been observed in soils jones et al 2014 while functionally verified n2o reducers are predominantly proteobacteria conthe et al 2018 hallin et al 2018 suenaga et al 2018 the many undiscovered n2o reducers from other phyla might play an important role in natural and engineered environments jones et al 2013 sanford et al 2012 singleton et al 2021 the majority of clade i nosz gene sequences have been identified in proteobacteria and are normally associated with denitrifying organisms hallin et al 2018 sanford et al 2012 yoon et al 2016 interestingly this was not observed in our analysis although there were three hq mags with a denitrifier clade i nosz gene predicted none of these hq mags had the full denitrification pathway predicted additionally none of these species had a significant correlation with the seasonal n2o concentration the majority 69 of the 72 of the nosz sequences predicted within the avedøre wwtp community were clade ii although this has been observed in other environments jones et al 2014 kim et al 2020 orellana et al 2014 suenaga et al 2021 this is the first study showing this overwhelming dominance of clade ii over clade i ratio 25 7 it could be that the proposed higher oxygen tolerance and affinity for n2o of the clade ii nos was selective for this community yoon et al 2016 4 4 other factors than the genomic n2o production or reduction potential predict the n2o concentration in the avedøre wwtp the community in avedøre wwtp had a large genetic potential to reduce n2o during the period studied other studies have shown that genomic n2o reduction potential and n2o emission level are correlated jones et al 2014 vieira et al 2018 with high nosz values relating to low n2o emissions in our dataset there were a high number of hq mags with a nosz predicted approximately 45 of the hq mags available suggesting a high genomic potential to reduce n2o this would imply that other factors than the genetic potential determine the n2o concentration in the wwtp however as we do not cover the entire community with the midas genome database long term monitoring of the nosz gene in the wwtp will be required to examine the nosz potential of the community without a hq mag many factors can influence the actual n2o reduction activity in full scale wwtps with dissolved oxygen concentrations often suggested as one of the key inhibitors for n2o reduction law et al 2012 pan et al 2013 suenaga et al 2018 the seasonal change in temperature can affect the dissolved oxygen concentration in the wwtp as well as the microbial conversion rates but its effect should be expected to be observed in both spring and fall additionally previous studies have identified only weak to no correlation between temperature as a parameter and n2o emissions ahn et al 2010 chen et al 2019 suggesting that temperature was not the dominant influencing factor another key parameter in n2o reduction is the electron availability as all enzymatic conversions in the denitrification pathway require electrons electron competition within the pathway can decrease in n2o reduction activity conthe et al 2018 felgate et al 2012 however the cod n ratio in the influent and the cod quality in the effluent remained stable throughout the studied period supplementary data s1 this does not exclude the possibility that the type of electron donor or carbon source shown to severely impact the n2o reductase activity itokawa et al 2001 pan et al 2013 qi et al 2022 ribera guardia et al 2014 2016 changed over the year table 1 n2o production can occur in both the aerobic and in the anoxic phase by aob and truncated denitrifiers song et al 2020 as n2o reduction only occurs during the anoxic phase kampschreur et al 2009 suenaga et al 2018 part of the produced n2o will directly be sparged out of the liquid during the aerobic phase although aerobic denitrification may occur robertson et al 1989 1995 and produce n2o the majority of the aerobically produced n2o is produced by aob tallec et al 2008 low dissolved oxygen concentrations and high nitrite concentrations have been shown to stimulate n2o production by aob kampschreur et al 2009 kozlowski et al 2016 as stated above if the seasonal temperature effect on dissolved oxygen affected n2o production by aob this would be expected to occur in both spring and fall while no nitrite concentrations were measured in the period studied it might be an interesting additional parameter to measure in future studies future work is required to elucidate the factors influencing seasonal under utilization of the high genetic n2o reduction potential of the community although this work provides a list of interesting candidates that could act as a n2o sink within avedøre wwtp many species are novel with little to no knowledge of their potential function meta omics data combined with n2o reductase activity assays measured with activated sludge throughout the year s could provide more insight into the physiology of n2o sink species this could result in mitigation strategies controlling species composition and n2o production and reduction activity 5 conclusions we found a recurrent strong seasonal n2o concentration pattern with spring peaks and autumn lows from avedøre wwtp over 3 years the relative read abundance of 54 species was significantly correlated to the n2o concentrations either positively or negatively partial denitrifiers instead of complete denitrifiers appeared to dominate the genetic denitrification potential of the community the cumulative abundances of n2o reducers and nob had a significant negative correlation to n2o concentrations clade ii nosz genes primarily found in bacteroidota were more common than clade i nosz genes in the hq mags multiple novel potential n2o sink species have been identified for further study overall there was some correlation between community structure and n2o concentration but activity measurements of specific bacteria are needed to understand the correlation in greater detail declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the authors wish to thank the avedøre wwtp for sharing the operational data and all the student

experimentally eeq by dgt yes assay ceeq and eeq highlighted that primary treatments are not suitable for estrogens and bisphenolic plastics removal both at drinkable and wastewater treatment plants in hamilton where they worsen the water quality in terms of estrogenicity making these pollutants more available in the water phase all downstream sites monitored along the waikato river showed higher ceeq and eeq moreover the waikato river water quality showed a moderate worsening moving from taupo source to tuakau outfall the most polluted sites were downstream of hamilton city and huntly township wastewater treatment plants that serve the main conurbations in the area ceeq and eeq generally showed good agreement at low concentrations but differed substantially at more polluted sites

screen bioassay yes has been employed to assess the estrogenic potency of particular classes of edcs such as surfactants routledge and sumpter 1996 and to evaluate the total estrogenic potency of environmental extracts murk et al 2002 rutishauser et al 2004 edcs concentration and potency are routinely monitored via active sampling followed by a pre concentration step typically solid phase extraction spe epa united states environmental protection agency 2010 coupled with chromatography and bioassay analysis respectively such approaches allow only the evaluation of transient environmental concentrations and potency thus the analytes detection over a long time range requires repeated sampling and analysis over defined time points this increases the overall cost and processing time to obtain reliable results to date there are very few examples of hyphenation of specific organic pollutants bioassays and dgt passive sampling ji et al 2021 and more combinations are required for predicting the bioavailability of certain classes of organic aquatic pollutants the only significant example of dgt coupling with a bioassay is in fact represented by its use in combination with the estrogen responsive element chemically activated luciferase gene expression bioassay ere calux guo et al 2017 2019 this study represents the first attempt at hyphenation between a dgt sampling strategy and the yes assay by applying the yes assay to the eluate derived from passive sampling using a green dgt specifically developed for edcs with known estrogenic potency such as e2

thick diffusive gel lod and loq were also calculated theoretically assuming 18 days of deployment environmental exposure at least 6 probes were deployed for each site monitored the probes were exposed in the environment for 18 days water temperature during dgt deployments was continuously recorded using tidbit temperature loggers at the moment of retrieval dgt probes were stored in deionized water

biomarker based assay preparation and estradiol equivalency quantities evaluation assays were carried out using the xenoscreen xl yes accelerated high sensitivity agonist assay kit xenometrix ag ag 2015 method development followed the manufacturers protocol as presented in previous published studies fic et al 2014 and eeq calculations were carried out adopting the xenometrix excel workbook ag 2015 briefly the yeast cells were handled in a microbiological safety cabinet to avoid bacteria contamination and were grown using an orbital shaker incubator 31 c 100 rpm cultures were inspected periodically during growth using an inverted microscope growing yeast cells stably transformed with the herα yes and β galactosidase reporter system were exposed to serial dilutions of e2 ee2 bpa and bpaf target analytes and a fixed concentration of the positive control chemical e2 and solvent control in order to build calibration curves cells were then exposed to dgt eluates collected from each sampling site monitored along with e2 positive control assayed in the its calibration range and solvent control cells were incubated for 18 h at 31 c the induced cells were lysed in the presence of the yellow substrate cprg which turned purple in the presence of β galactosidase colour development of the bioassay was evaluated colorimetrically using a microplate spectrophotometer yeast cell growth was assessed by measurements of optical density at 690 nm prior to addition of the lysis buffer the color development absorbance was measured at 570 nm and was corrected for diffraction by cells and debris by a simultaneous optical density measurement at 690 nm od690 the results were evaluated for estrogenic activities as well as for yeast growth inhibition or cytotoxicity 2 6 yes assay calibration sample analysis qa qc stock solutions e2 1 µm ee2 1 µm bpa 10 nm bpaf 1 mm were prepared in dmso serial dilutions in sterile h2o and the volumes of the stock solutions to be added to the sterile water were calculated for half logarithmic dilution steps with the final volume of 80 µl solvent controls were always run along with the standards all target compounds were tested at 8 different concentrations in two independent experiments in duplicate to build the dose response curves for the calculation of estrogenic activities specifically the concentrations investigated were in the range 2 1 pm 6 7 nm for the e2 and ee2 and 21 nm 6 7 µm for the bpa and 2 1 nm 6 7 µm for the bpaf for each environmental sample 0 5 ml of meoh dgt eluate and 0 5 ml of etoh dgt eluate were combined and dried using a rotor concentrator room temperature 6 h they were then dissolved in 1 ml of sterile h2o dmso 1 and 80 µl were transferred to the 96 well plate for the single dose tests in duplicate to estimate the relative activities the e2 standard stock solution 1 µm was employed as positive control and was assayed in the range 2 1 pm 6 7 nm the e2 standard along with the environmental samples and the solvent were tested in duplicate experimental eeqs derived from the yes assay were compared to the calculated ceeq derived from dgt hplc ms analysis and eef factors derived from yes assay calibration by double tailed welch modified two sample t test using r this test assumes a normal distribution for both populations but not the same variance and was performed to verify if the mean obtained by the two methods were equal or not indicating as μeeq and μceeq the mean value of eeq and ceeq respectively the two hypotheses can be formulated as follows h 0 n u l l h

locations dgts probes were assembled prior to environmental deployment as shown in fig 2 c probes were deployed in the waikato river upstream and at waiora water treatment plant hwtp which produces potable water for hamilton city at critical stages of the water treatment after sedimentation after uv disinfection at a large municipal storage reservoir located in the suburb of pukete and from domestic tap water fig 2a dgts were also deployed at the pukete wastewater treatment plant pwwtp which processes wastewater form hamilton city at crucial stages primary sedimentation after secondary clarifiers after uv disinfection and in the waikato river downstream of the pwwtp outfall fig 2b water quality of the waikato river new zealand s longest at 425 km was monitored from its source at lake taupo to tuakau at particular locations used by different urban councils as sources of drinking water or wastewater discharge fig 2d the locations monitored were in order lake taupo upstream

downstream tuakau tuakau is the last significant township 30 km upstream from the river s outfall to the tasman sea and is the location of a major source of drinking water for auckland city population 1 46 million six dgts were deployed at each location together with a tidbit temperature logger for durations of up to 18 days 3 results and discussion 3 1 yes assay dose response curves and ec50 values ec50 is defined as the concentration of agonist needed to reach 50 of the maximum signal ag 2015 the experimental ec50 value of the 17 β estradiol e2 was determined to be in the sub nanomolar range ec50 4 47 e 10 m and in the same order of magnitude to literature values adopting the same assay fic et al 2014 the limit of detection lod was 4 01 e 11 m while the limit of quantification loq was 7 67 e 11 m the concentration intervals tested for each target in the assay were chosen according to the active concentration range of each compound evaluated in previous investigations fic et al 2014 the e2 equivalency factors eef of the target analytes were calculated in the yes assay according to an eight point standard e2 curve ee2 bpa and bpaf proved to have agonistic endocrine activity showing all induction ratio ir ir 10 of the difference between the maximum e2 and the solvent control in the agonist assay their dose response curves shown in fig 3 a and fig 3b had satisfactory coefficients of regression r2 0 9 all the compounds investigated dose dependently increased the secretion of β galactosidase in the yeast assay both ec50 and eefs followed the trends and the values found in the literature as reported in table 1 rutishauser et al 2004 ruan et al 2015 and table 2 murk et al 2002 ruan et al 2015 respectively 3 2 waiora treatment plant hwtp river to tap water monitoring the monitoring of the hwtp from river tap water took place between october and november 2017 during the exposure time no significant rainstorms took place all probes were retrieved without significant damage significant results and data correlations of the monitoring are reported in table 3 and fig 4 e2 ee2 bpa and bpaf concentrations determined by dgt hplc ms ranged from 0 6 to 19 1 ng l 1 and were comparable with those of other published studies that have examined surface freshwaters that serve urban areas around the world such as in china huang et al 2012 usa huang et al 2012 turkey aris et al 2014 italy pojana et al 2007 portugal rocha et al 2013 and previous waikato river monitoring tremblay and northcott 2013 ee2 maximum of 19 ng l 1 at waiora sedimentation and bpa maximum of 5 ng l 1 at waikato river upstream were the most commonly detected compounds and their trend was similar to those of other published monitoring of surface waters duong et al 2010 ee2 and bpa trends could be associated to the different chemistry and partitioning of the these compounds campbell et al 2006 ee2 kow 4 british columbia government 2017 and bpa 2 2 kow 3 4 borrirukwisitsak et al 2012 show in fact a relatively high octanol water partition coefficient making them more likely to bind to organic matter sedimentation can be applied prior or after coagulation in both cases its purpose is to reduce the concentration of particles and solids in suspension to decrease the chemicals needed during the process of coagulation or to make more effective the filtration respectively bache and gregory 2010 thus primary treatments are not designed for chemicals removal ceeqs and eeq agreed on the inefficacy of the primary sedimentation treatment for estrogens and bisphenolic plastics removal where they appear ineffective in terms of lowing estrogenicity making these estrogens more available in the water phase rather than promoting their removal another explanation to this phenomena could be given by the fact that ee2 conjugates are often converted back into their free forms during water treatment processes regaining potency as shown in other treatment plants monitoring gentili et al 2002 farré et al 2008 noppe et al 2007 the depletion of the selected edcs concentration during the treatment process corresponded to a decrease in estrogenic activity until not detectable eeq lod in the tap water the divergence between ceeq and eeq in the tap water could be explained by the fact that the tap water was monitored with only 2 dgt probes for practicality while all the other sampling sites were monitored with 6 dgts thus in the absence of a consistent number of replicate analyses ceeq values are not reliable and can be used only as an indication ceeqs and eeqs values resulted from the water monitoring at the hwtp appeared to be mainly in accordance with ratios very close to 1 this accordance is due to a small matrix effect high dgt selectivity with eluates enriched essentially by the analytes of interest this assumption is reasonable because the hwtp has the highest water quality among all the sites analysed with low interference by organic matter and particulates theoretical ceeq appeared to underestimate the total estradiol equivalency quantity at the most polluted stage waiora sedimentation since it does not take in count mixture of unidentified edcs not quantified during the analytical trace analysis that were eluted from dgt along with the target s compounds and to overestimate the total estradiol equivalency quantity at the less polluted sampling site tap water since it does not take in count edcs antagonist coaction david et al 2009 3 3 pukete wastewater treatment plant pwtp effluent to treated wastewater monitoring the monitoring of the pwtp from effluent to treated wastewater was also carried out between october and november 2017 during the exposure time the favourable weather conditions allowed to retrieve dgt probes without significant damage final results and data correlations of the monitoring are summarized in table 4 and fig 5 concentrations of the investigated edcs determined by dgt deployments at the pwtp ranged from 0 6 to 24 6 ng l 1 and were comparable to those determined from other wastewaters monitoring studies in the usa huang et al 2012 and canada huang et al 2012 from surface waters that serve urban areas aris et al 2014 pojana et al 2007 rocha et al 2013 and previous waikato river monitoring tremblay and northcott 2013 as expected the contaminated inflow wastewater showed estradiol equivalency quantities higher than that of the treated outflow dgt hplc ms ceeq and dgt yes eeqs dosages agreed on and confirmed again the ineffectiveness of primary treatments in the removal of the selected pollutants they in fact worsen the water quality rather than improving it with respect to ecs and promote the availability of the pollutants in the water phase the highest estradiol equivalency quantities were recorded at puteke sedimentation where bpa reached its maximum concentration 6 6 ng l 1 and at puteke secondary clarifiers where ee2 reached its maximum concentration of 24 6 ng l 1 likewise during the hwtp monitoring bpa and ee2 resulted the main pollutants possible explanations could be connected to their relatively high octanol water partition coefficients british columbia government 2017 borrirukwisitsak et al 2012 that allow them to bind rapidly to the organic matter and to the fact that estrogen conjugates may be converted back into their free forms during water treatment processes regaining potency gentili et al 2002 farré et al 2008 noppe et al 2007 the dgt method employed in this research was optimized to recover estrogens in their free forms from the dgt binding layer iuele et al 2021 it was preferred to evaluate the contribution of the free forms over the conjugated forms since the latter are less active than the first they may degrade to their free form under aerobic conditions sarmah and northcott 2008 and they are usually converted back into their free forms during water treatment processes as previously mentioned ceeqs and eeqs values determined during pwtp water monitoring were higher than those of the hwtp water monitoring at every treatment stage because pwtp inflow water is represented by the urban wastewater of hamilton city population 0 16 million the depletion of the concentration of all the analytes during the treatment processes corresponded in a progressively decreased estrogenic activity however despite the different treatments applied the inflow water quality at hwtp waikato upstream eeq 1 8e 09 g l 1 was higher than the outflow water quality at pwtp waikato downstream eeq 4 2e 08 g l 1 corresponding in a worsening of the water quality going down the river ceeqs and eeqs ratios during the wastewater monitoring at the pwtp appeared less close to 1 and less in accordance compared to hwtp ratios this is likely due to a bigger matrix effect and low selectivity of the dgt in fact matrix effect due to the potential interference from sample matrix can cause ion suppression or ion enhancement although the former is most common during hplc ms and this effect in some cases can compromise the analytical results zhou and kang 2013 several strategies are available to compensate the matrix interference one approach consists in selective sample extraction to limit the co eluting material van de steene et al 2006 dgt method allowed selective sample extraction since it was tailored to elute bisphenols and free forms of estrogens from the binding layer compensating the matrix effect at the most polluted sites the divergence between ceeq evaluated via hplc ms and the eeq evaluated via yes assay was mainly associated to the fact that other bisphenols and hormones not monitored by hplc ms were eluted along with those monitored however despite dgt selective sample extraction we acknowledged that ceeq value could be affected by ion suppression or ion enhancement during hplc ms analysis because it is difficult to fully correct the matrix effect experimentally the difference between eeq and ceeq values could also be enhanced by synergistic coaction of the target compounds david et al 2009 with estrogenic compounds not investigated during the hplc ms analysis the highest divergence between theoretical ceeq and eeq values is noticeable at starting treatment stages sedimentation and secondary clarification that are the most polluted stages with the lowest water quality in fact theoretical ceeq underestimates the total estradiol equivalency quantity since it does not take in count like eeq that estrogens co presence is not simply addictive but it can lead to synergic interaction david et al 2009 lastly fine sediments and particulates are particularly present at these stages in which they not only work as sinks accumulating pollutants on their surface lai et al 2000 but can interfere with the efficiency of dgt sampling and compromise its quality by settling on its protective membrane causing biofouling and degradation urík and vrana 2019 3 4 waikato river source to outfall monitoring the waikato river from source to outfall water quality monitoring took place between january and february 2018 rainstorms prior to the retrieval time caused significant flooding diluting the pollutants of interest in the environment and damaging some of the dgt probes as well all probes deployed at cambridge upstream were lost however the consistent number of probes deployed ensured replicated analysis in all the other sites significant results of the monitoring and data analysis are shown in table 5 and fig 6 concentrations of the estrogens investigated ranged from 0 5 to 9 2 g l 1 and were similar to those of other surface freshwaters that serve urban areas huang et al 2012 aris et al 2014 pojana et al 2007 rocha et al 2013 and previous waikato river monitoring tremblay and northcott 2013 bpa considered to be an ubiquitous pollutant with a concentration assumed as background tremblay and northcott 2013 was present at all sites it ranged from 1 1 g l 1 at lake taupo upstream to 3 4 g l 1 at huntly waikato downstream estradiol equivalency quantities were detected as well at lake taupo considered to be a pristine environment free of urban wastewater influence they could be associated with agricultural activity in the lake s catchment conroy et al 2007 to the lack of antagonistic chemicals and to reduced microbial activity in this oligotrophic environment that could help the removal of these contaminants avoiding their accumulation fic et al 2014 ceeq and eeq were higher in the downstream of all the monitored sites ceeq and eeq increased from the source to the outfall in fact it was possible to determine a moderate worsening of water quality moving from taupo to tuakau with estradiol equivalency quantities peaking at hamilton downstream and huntly downstream from their respective wastewater treatment plants wwtps moreover the waikato river catchment is an area exploited for extensive dairy farming thus non point source discharges could impact the water quality further downstream tuakau samples still showed a consistent estrogenic activity but with a noticeable dilution however this effect could be associated with both microbial degradation and particulate binding since water quality becomes increasingly eutrophic downstream it appeared from the correlation of the calculated and experimental total estradiol equivalency quantities eeq ceeq that theoretical quantification overestimated estradiol equivalency quantities at upstream sites where estrogens concentration is low and underestimate estradiol equivalency quantities downstream where the concentration is high predicted eeqs ceeqs differed from experimental eeqs at some sites in particular the most polluted ones at these sites other estrogens with similar affinity for the dgt elution solvents lai et al 2000 could be sampled and accumulated david et al 2009 increasing the total estradiol equivalency quantities eeq evaluated by the yes assay however it should be noticed that surface waters are well mixed due to the reasonable and constant water flow and this has probably avoided the accumulation of material on the dgt membrane thus eeqs and ceeqs did not differ to the same degree seen during the pwtp effluent to treated wastewater monitoring estradiol equivalency quantities of selected edcs were evaluated by the regional council during a survey of the waikato river in november 2013 tremblay and northcott 2013 the selected method consisted of an active sampling and spe extraction of 10 l of aqueous sample to determine the lod prior to meln assay that exploits reporter cell lines balaguer et al 1999 in our study eeqs of selected edcs in the waikato river were evaluated adopting dgt passive sampling assuming 18 days of deployment to determine the lod prior to the yes assay that exploits a recombinant brew yeast ag 2015 the limits of detection lods of the different spe meln and dgt yes are for 17β estradiol 7 20e 11 g l and 1 04e 09 g l respectively the spe meln assay appeared more sensitive compared to the dgt yes assay however both assays ensure quantification in the ng l 1 range thus the eeqs detected by the regional council during november 2013 were compared with those evaluated by this investigation in the same locations during january and february 2018 data arose from the monitoring just mentioned and the present study are compared in table 6 eeqs from both studies are generally in accordance at all sites investigated with the possibility that taupo upstream and at tuakau showed increased eeqs from 2013 to 2018 however more analysis would be required to confirm a deterioration of the water quality 4 conclusion endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs are compounds that interfere with endocrine homeostasis in animals and are of increasing concern ecologically estrogenic compounds natural and anthropogenic such as 17β estradiol e2 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 bisphenol a bpa and the analogue bisphenol af bpaf are one class of edcs and have been implicated in human and non human reproductive disorders and significant ecological impacts this study attempted to quantify e2 ee2 bpa and bpaf total estradiol equivalency quantities using a novel coupling of dgt hplc ms analysis with a biomarker based yeast estrogen screen the yes assay uses the saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains recombined in order to identify compounds that are human estrogen receptor herα active ag 2015 and among the others was selected due to its robustness test speed and relatively low cost dgt eluates were treated to be compatible with the yes assay theoretical estradiol equivalency quantities ceeq were calculated from dgt hplc ms analysis and experimental estradiol equivalency quantities eeq were calculated from the concatenated dgt yes assay selected monitoring of different stages of drinking and wastewater treatment confirmed the utility of the assay method and revealed possible increases in water borne estradiol equivalency due to treatment involving removal of particulate phases but confirmed the efficacy of treatment in reducing biologically active estrogenic compounds discrepancies between ceeq and eeq were apparent at some stages of treatment possibly due to dgt eluates being enriched by other estrogenic compounds not determined by hplc analysis this divergence was particularly observed at early treatment stages sedimentation and secondary clarification where ceeq underestimated the total estradiol equivalency quantities waikato river source to outfall monitoring using the same system revealed that ceeq and eeq were higher downstream at all sites along the river eeqs increased from the source to the outfall with peak activities at hamilton and huntly after the outlets of wastewater treatment plants that serve these main urban areas dgt hplc ms and dgt yes assay hyphenation provided a correct total estrogenic potency evaluation moreover ceeq and eeq showed always consistent trends in particular dgt yes assay and the correspondent eeq is a fast and convenient approach that allows in a single measurement to capture all of the estrogenic compounds rather than just the ones with analytical standards representing better the real estrogenic disruption especially at the most polluted sites dgt hpc ms and the correspondent ceeq resulted to correctly predict the estrogenic disruption only in the case of a comprehensive analytes screening thus matching the values obtainable with the bioassay eeq this study demonstrated that this type of dgt could be suitable for passive sampling and accumulation of estrogenic compounds that can be evaluated for their total estrogenic activity using the yes assay but better congruency between the ceeq and eeq values requires a more complete identification of all major compounds accumulated that might contribute to total estrogenic potency credit authorship contribution statement helena iuele conceptualization

chromatography mass spectrometry analysis hplc ms and the yeast estrogen screen yes estradiol equivalency quantities integrated in time were evaluated theoretically ceeq by dgt hplc ms and experimentally eeq by dgt yes assay ceeq and eeq highlighted that primary treatments are not suitable for estrogens and bisphenolic plastics removal both at drinkable and wastewater treatment plants in hamilton where they worsen the water quality in terms of estrogenicity making these pollutants more available in the water phase all downstream sites monitored along the waikato river showed higher ceeq and eeq moreover the waikato river water quality showed a moderate worsening moving from taupo source to tuakau outfall the most polluted sites were downstream of hamilton city and huntly township wastewater treatment plants that serve the main conurbations in the area ceeq and eeq generally showed good agreement at low concentrations but differed substantially at more polluted sites where ceeq consistently underestimated estrogenic potency possibly due to dgt accumulation of estrogenic compounds not quantified by hplc ms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords diffusive gradients in thin films dgts yeast estrogen screen assay yes assay emerging endocrine disruptors edcs in situ monitoring 1 introduction natural and synthetic substances that interfere with endocrine homeostasis in animals are defined as endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs these substances have been demonstrated to cause a variety of pathological conditions including reproductive disorders cancer sterility hermaphroditism and metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity both in human and non human who world health organization and ipcs international programme on chemical safety 2002 endocrine disrupting compounds include a wide range of chemicals with differing potencies which defines their ability to cause effects ruenitz et al 1996 one of the most studied edc groups includes natural or synthetic compounds that activate the vertebrate estrogen receptors with the most potent being the synthetic steroid sex hormones 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 and natural 17β estradiol e2 with proven carcinogenic effects fernández et al 2004 jaakkola et al 2011 other less potent synthetic estrogenic compounds includes widely produced plastic monomers such as bisphenol a bpa 5 million tonnes globally per year huang et al 2012 and its substitute bisphenol af bpaf 100 tonnes per year in china alone song et al 2012 the carcinogenic potential of these compounds has been demonstrated for conditions such as adenomyosis leiomyomas atypical hyperplasia stromal polyps newbold et al 2007 and breast tumours dairkee et al 2008 in the case of bpa exposure reproductive toxicity yang et al 2016 and thyroid cancer marotta et al 2019 have been observed due to bpaf exposure and mammary cancer in offsprings de assis et al 2012 following ee2 exposure during pregnancy endocrine disruption by these has also been extensively observed in aquatic ecosystems where large point source discharges occur from wastewater treatment plants and there is potential for trophic transfer and biomagnification to take place suedel et al 1994 matthiessen et al 2018 moreover their interaction can lead to unpredictable results due to additive and synergistic phenomena david et al 2009 thus the monitoring of concentration and potency of both estrogens and bisphenols in freshwater ecosystems is increasingly important for an understanding of their environmental impact passive sampling methodologies such as polar organic chemical integrative samplers pocis and namely diffusive gradients in thin films dgts are suitable for investigating low concentrations of estrogenic compounds in natural waters and combines sampling and concentration in a single step allowing the estimation of in situ time integrated concentrations dgts are suitable to quantify dissolved species for which a selective binding agent exists thus dgts can be customized in order to quantify a broad range of inorganic zhang and davison 1995 and organic iuele et al 2021 species additionally bio marker based assays are powerful and well validated tools due to their specificity selectivity speed and relatively low cost epa united states environmental protection agency 1978 they allow correlation of the exposure derived from the analytical quantification with the potency and thus the potential effect on the freshwater ecosystem murk et al 2002 leusch et al 2010 the yeast estrogen screen bioassay yes has been employed to assess the estrogenic potency of particular classes of edcs such as surfactants routledge and sumpter 1996 and to evaluate the total estrogenic potency of environmental extracts murk et al 2002 rutishauser et al 2004 edcs concentration and potency are routinely monitored via active sampling followed by a pre concentration step typically solid phase extraction spe epa united states environmental protection agency 2010 coupled with chromatography and bioassay analysis respectively such approaches allow only the evaluation of transient environmental concentrations and potency thus the analytes detection over a long time range requires repeated sampling and analysis over defined time points this increases the overall cost and processing time to obtain reliable results to date there are very few examples of hyphenation of specific organic pollutants bioassays and dgt passive sampling ji et al 2021 and more combinations are required for predicting the bioavailability of certain classes of organic aquatic pollutants the only significant example of dgt coupling with a bioassay is in fact represented by its use in combination with the estrogen responsive element chemically activated luciferase gene expression bioassay ere calux guo et al 2017 2019 this study represents the first attempt at hyphenation between a dgt sampling strategy and the yes assay by applying the yes assay to the eluate derived from passive sampling using a green dgt specifically developed for edcs with known estrogenic potency such as e2 ee2 bpa and bpaf targets analytes were selected to represent some of the most potent compounds with estrogenic activity known today fernández et al 2004 dairkee et al 2008 and they represent emerging unregulated pollutants petrovic et al 2004 included in the latest chemical contaminant candidate list drafted by the u s environmental protection agency epa united states environmental protection

thick diffusive gel lod and loq were also calculated theoretically assuming 18 days of deployment environmental exposure at least 6 probes were deployed for each site monitored the probes were exposed in the environment for 18 days water temperature during dgt deployments was continuously recorded using tidbit temperature loggers at the moment of retrieval dgt probes were stored in deionized water until lab analysis the probes were disassembled then 2 binding gels per site were combined and 10 ml of etoh for 24 h were adopted to elute e2 and ee2 then 10 ml of meoh for 24 h to elute bpa and bpaf

2015 briefly the yeast cells were handled in a microbiological safety cabinet to avoid bacteria contamination and were grown using an orbital shaker incubator 31 c 100 rpm cultures were inspected periodically during growth using an inverted microscope growing yeast cells stably transformed with the herα yes and β galactosidase reporter system were exposed to serial dilutions of e2 ee2 bpa and bpaf target analytes and a fixed concentration of the positive control chemical e2 and solvent control in order to build calibration curves cells were then exposed to dgt eluates collected from each sampling site monitored along with e2 positive control assayed in the its calibration range and solvent control cells were incubated for 18 h at 31 c the induced cells were lysed in the presence of the yellow substrate cprg which turned purple in the presence of β galactosidase colour development of the bioassay was evaluated colorimetrically using a microplate spectrophotometer yeast cell growth was assessed by measurements of optical density at 690 nm prior to addition of the lysis buffer the color development absorbance was measured at 570 nm and was corrected for diffraction by cells and debris by a simultaneous optical density measurement at 690 nm od690 the results were evaluated for estrogenic activities as well as for yeast growth inhibition or cytotoxicity 2 6 yes assay calibration sample analysis qa qc stock solutions e2 1 µm ee2 1 µm bpa 10 nm bpaf 1 mm were prepared in dmso serial dilutions in sterile h2o and the volumes of the stock solutions to be added to the sterile water were calculated for half logarithmic dilution steps with the final volume of 80 µl solvent controls were always run along with the standards all target compounds were tested at 8 different concentrations in two independent experiments in duplicate to build the dose response curves for the calculation of estrogenic activities specifically the concentrations investigated were in the range 2 1 pm 6 7 nm for the e2 and ee2 and 21 nm 6 7 µm for the bpa and 2 1 nm 6 7 µm for the bpaf for each environmental sample 0 5 ml of meoh dgt eluate and 0 5 ml of etoh dgt eluate were combined and dried using a rotor concentrator room temperature 6 h they were then dissolved in 1 ml of sterile h2o dmso 1 and 80 µl were transferred to the 96 well plate for the single dose tests in duplicate to estimate the relative activities the e2 standard stock solution 1 µm was employed as positive control and was assayed in the range 2 1 pm 6 7 nm the e2 standard along with the environmental samples and the solvent were tested in duplicate experimental eeqs derived from the yes assay were compared to the calculated ceeq derived from dgt hplc ms analysis and eef factors derived from yes assay calibration by double tailed welch modified two sample t test using r this test assumes a normal distribution for both populations but not the same variance and was performed to verify if the mean obtained by the two methods were equal or not indicating as μeeq and μceeq the mean value of eeq and ceeq respectively the two hypotheses can be formulated as follows h 0 n u l l h

locations dgts probes were assembled prior to environmental deployment as shown in fig 2 c probes were deployed in the waikato river upstream and at waiora water treatment plant hwtp which produces potable water for hamilton city at critical stages of the water treatment after sedimentation after uv disinfection at a large municipal storage reservoir located in the suburb of pukete and from domestic tap water fig 2a dgts were also deployed at the pukete wastewater treatment plant pwwtp which processes wastewater form hamilton city at crucial stages primary sedimentation after secondary clarifiers after uv disinfection and in the waikato river downstream of the pwwtp outfall fig 2b water quality of the waikato river new zealand s longest at 425 km was monitored from its source at lake taupo to tuakau at particular locations used by different urban councils as sources of drinking water or wastewater discharge fig 2d the locations monitored were in order lake taupo upstream

downstream tuakau tuakau is the last significant township 30 km upstream from the river s outfall to the tasman sea and is the location of a major source of drinking water for auckland city population 1 46 million six dgts were deployed at each location together with a tidbit temperature logger for durations of up to 18 days 3 results and discussion 3 1 yes assay dose response curves and ec50 values ec50 is defined as the concentration of agonist needed to reach 50 of the maximum signal ag 2015 the experimental ec50 value of the 17 β estradiol e2 was determined to be in the sub nanomolar range ec50 4 47 e 10 m and in the same order of magnitude to literature values adopting the same assay fic et al 2014 the limit of detection lod was 4 01 e 11 m while the limit of quantification loq was 7 67 e 11 m the concentration intervals tested for each target in the assay were chosen according to the active concentration range of each compound evaluated in previous investigations fic et al 2014 the e2 equivalency factors eef of the target analytes were calculated in the yes assay according to an eight point standard e2 curve ee2 bpa and bpaf proved to have agonistic endocrine activity showing all induction ratio ir ir 10 of the difference between the maximum e2 and the solvent control in the agonist assay their dose response curves shown in fig 3 a and fig 3b had satisfactory coefficients of regression r2 0 9 all the compounds investigated dose dependently increased the secretion of β galactosidase in the yeast assay both ec50 and eefs followed the trends and the values found in the literature as reported in table 1 rutishauser et al 2004 ruan et al 2015 and table 2 murk et al 2002 ruan et al 2015 respectively 3 2 waiora treatment plant hwtp river to tap water monitoring the monitoring of the hwtp from river tap water took place between october and november 2017 during the exposure time no significant rainstorms took place all probes were retrieved without significant damage significant results and data correlations of the monitoring are reported in table 3 and fig 4 e2 ee2 bpa and bpaf concentrations determined by dgt hplc ms ranged from 0 6 to 19 1 ng l 1 and were comparable with those of other published studies that have examined surface freshwaters that serve urban areas around the world such as in china huang et al 2012 usa huang et al 2012 turkey aris et al 2014 italy pojana et al 2007 portugal rocha et al 2013 and previous waikato river monitoring tremblay and northcott 2013 ee2 maximum of 19 ng l 1 at waiora sedimentation and bpa maximum of 5 ng l 1 at waikato river upstream were the most commonly detected compounds and their trend was similar to those of other published monitoring of surface waters duong et al 2010 ee2 and bpa trends could be associated to the different chemistry and partitioning of the these compounds campbell et al 2006 ee2 kow 4 british columbia government 2017 and bpa 2 2 kow 3 4 borrirukwisitsak et al 2012 show in fact a relatively high octanol water partition coefficient making them more likely to bind to organic matter sedimentation can be applied prior or after coagulation in both cases its purpose is to reduce the concentration of particles and solids in suspension to decrease the chemicals needed during the process of coagulation or to make more effective the filtration respectively bache and gregory 2010 thus primary treatments are not designed for chemicals removal ceeqs and eeq agreed on the inefficacy of the primary sedimentation treatment for estrogens and bisphenolic plastics removal where they appear ineffective in terms of lowing estrogenicity making these estrogens more available in the water phase rather than promoting their removal another explanation to this phenomena could be given by the fact that ee2 conjugates are often converted back into their free forms during water treatment processes regaining potency as shown in other treatment plants monitoring gentili et al 2002 farré et al 2008 noppe et al 2007 the depletion of the selected edcs concentration during the treatment process corresponded to a decrease in estrogenic activity until not detectable eeq lod in the tap water the divergence between ceeq and eeq in the tap water could be explained by the fact that the tap water was monitored with only 2 dgt probes for practicality while all the other sampling sites were monitored with 6 dgts thus in the absence of a consistent number of replicate analyses ceeq values are not reliable and can be used only as an indication ceeqs and eeqs values resulted from the water monitoring at the hwtp appeared to be mainly in accordance with ratios very close to 1 this accordance is due to a small matrix effect high dgt selectivity with eluates enriched essentially by the analytes of interest this assumption is reasonable because the hwtp has the highest water quality among all the sites analysed with low interference by organic matter and particulates theoretical ceeq appeared to underestimate the total estradiol equivalency quantity at the most polluted stage waiora sedimentation since it does not take in count mixture of unidentified edcs not quantified during the analytical trace analysis that were eluted from dgt along with the target s compounds and to overestimate the total estradiol equivalency quantity at the less polluted sampling site tap water since it does not take in count edcs antagonist coaction david et al 2009 3 3 pukete wastewater treatment plant pwtp effluent to treated wastewater monitoring the monitoring of the pwtp from effluent to treated wastewater was also carried out between october and november 2017 during the exposure time the favourable weather conditions allowed to retrieve dgt probes without significant damage final results and data correlations of the monitoring are summarized in table 4 and fig 5 concentrations of the investigated edcs determined by dgt deployments at the pwtp ranged from 0 6 to 24 6 ng l 1 and were comparable to those determined from other wastewaters monitoring studies in the usa huang et al 2012 and canada huang et al 2012 from surface waters that serve urban areas aris et al 2014 pojana et al 2007 rocha et al 2013 and previous waikato river monitoring tremblay and northcott 2013 as expected the contaminated inflow wastewater showed estradiol equivalency quantities higher than that of the treated outflow dgt hplc ms ceeq and dgt yes eeqs dosages agreed on and confirmed again the ineffectiveness of primary treatments in the removal of the selected pollutants they in fact worsen the water quality rather than improving it with respect to ecs and promote the availability of the pollutants in the water phase the highest estradiol equivalency quantities were recorded at puteke sedimentation where bpa reached its maximum concentration 6 6 ng l 1 and at puteke secondary clarifiers where ee2 reached its maximum concentration of 24 6 ng l 1 likewise during the hwtp monitoring bpa and ee2 resulted the main pollutants possible explanations could be connected to their relatively high octanol water partition coefficients british columbia government 2017 borrirukwisitsak et al 2012 that allow them to bind rapidly to the organic matter and to the fact that estrogen conjugates may be converted back into their free forms during water treatment processes regaining potency gentili et al 2002 farré et al 2008 noppe et al 2007 the dgt method employed in this research was optimized to recover estrogens in their free forms from the dgt binding layer iuele et al 2021 it was preferred to evaluate the contribution of the free forms over the conjugated forms since the latter are less active than the first they may degrade to their free form under aerobic conditions sarmah and northcott 2008 and they are usually converted back into their free forms during water treatment processes as previously mentioned ceeqs and eeqs values determined during pwtp water monitoring were higher than those of the hwtp water monitoring at every treatment stage because pwtp inflow water is represented by the urban wastewater of hamilton city population 0 16 million the depletion of the concentration of all the analytes during the treatment processes corresponded in a progressively decreased estrogenic activity however despite the different treatments applied the inflow water quality at hwtp waikato upstream eeq 1 8e 09 g l 1 was higher than the outflow water quality at pwtp waikato downstream eeq 4 2e 08 g l 1 corresponding in a worsening of the water quality going down the river ceeqs and eeqs ratios during the wastewater monitoring at the pwtp appeared less close to 1 and less in accordance compared to hwtp ratios this is likely due to a bigger matrix effect and low selectivity of the dgt in fact matrix effect due to the potential interference from sample matrix can cause ion suppression or ion enhancement although the former is most common during hplc ms and this effect in some cases can compromise the analytical results zhou and kang 2013 several strategies are available to compensate the matrix interference one approach consists in selective sample extraction to limit the co eluting material van de steene et al 2006 dgt method allowed selective sample extraction since it was tailored to elute bisphenols and free forms of estrogens from the binding layer compensating the matrix effect at the most polluted sites the divergence between ceeq evaluated via hplc ms and the eeq evaluated via yes assay was mainly associated to the fact that other bisphenols and hormones not monitored by hplc ms were eluted along with those monitored however despite dgt selective sample extraction we acknowledged that ceeq value could be affected by ion suppression or ion enhancement during hplc ms analysis because it is difficult to fully correct the matrix effect experimentally the difference between eeq and ceeq values could also be enhanced by synergistic coaction of the target compounds david et al 2009 with estrogenic compounds not investigated during the hplc ms analysis the highest divergence between theoretical ceeq and eeq values is noticeable at starting treatment stages sedimentation and secondary clarification that are the most polluted stages with the lowest water quality in fact theoretical ceeq underestimates the total estradiol equivalency quantity since it does not take in count like eeq that estrogens co presence is not simply addictive but it can lead to synergic interaction david et al 2009 lastly fine sediments and particulates are particularly present at these stages in which they not only work as sinks accumulating pollutants on their surface lai et al 2000 but can interfere with the efficiency of dgt sampling and compromise its quality by settling on its protective membrane causing biofouling and degradation urík and vrana 2019 3 4 waikato river source to outfall monitoring the waikato river from source to outfall water quality monitoring took place between january and february 2018 rainstorms prior to the retrieval time caused significant flooding diluting the pollutants of interest in the environment and damaging some of the dgt probes as well all probes deployed at cambridge upstream were lost however the consistent number of probes deployed ensured replicated analysis in all the other sites significant results of the monitoring and data analysis are shown in table 5 and fig 6 concentrations of the estrogens investigated ranged from 0 5 to 9 2 g l 1 and were similar to those of other surface freshwaters that serve urban areas huang et al 2012 aris et al 2014 pojana et al 2007 rocha et al 2013 and previous waikato river monitoring tremblay and northcott 2013 bpa considered to be an ubiquitous pollutant with a concentration assumed as background tremblay and northcott 2013 was present at all sites it ranged from 1 1 g l 1 at lake taupo upstream to 3 4 g l 1 at huntly waikato downstream estradiol equivalency quantities were detected as well at lake taupo considered to be a pristine environment free of urban wastewater influence they could be associated with agricultural activity in the lake s catchment conroy et al 2007 to the lack of antagonistic chemicals and to reduced microbial activity in this oligotrophic environment that could help the removal of these contaminants avoiding their accumulation fic et al 2014 ceeq and eeq were higher in the downstream of all the monitored sites ceeq and eeq increased from the source to the outfall in fact it was possible to determine a moderate worsening of water quality moving from taupo to tuakau with estradiol equivalency quantities peaking at hamilton downstream and huntly downstream from their respective wastewater treatment plants wwtps moreover the waikato river catchment is an area exploited for extensive dairy farming thus non point source discharges could impact the water quality further downstream tuakau samples still showed a consistent estrogenic activity but with a noticeable dilution however this effect could be associated with both microbial degradation and particulate binding since water quality becomes increasingly eutrophic downstream it appeared from the correlation of the calculated and experimental total estradiol equivalency quantities eeq ceeq that theoretical quantification overestimated estradiol equivalency quantities at upstream sites where estrogens concentration is low and underestimate estradiol equivalency quantities downstream where the concentration is high predicted eeqs ceeqs differed from experimental eeqs at some sites in particular the most polluted ones at these sites other estrogens with similar affinity for the dgt elution solvents lai et al 2000 could be sampled and accumulated david et al 2009 increasing the total estradiol equivalency quantities eeq evaluated by the yes assay however it should be noticed that surface waters are well mixed due to the reasonable and constant water flow and this has probably avoided the accumulation of material on the dgt membrane thus eeqs and ceeqs did not differ to the same degree seen during the pwtp effluent to treated wastewater monitoring estradiol equivalency quantities of selected edcs were evaluated by the regional council during a survey of the waikato river in november 2013 tremblay and northcott 2013 the selected method consisted of an active sampling and spe extraction of 10 l of aqueous sample to determine the lod prior to meln assay that exploits reporter cell lines balaguer et al 1999 in our study eeqs of selected edcs in the waikato river were evaluated adopting dgt passive sampling assuming 18 days of deployment to determine the lod prior to the yes assay that exploits a recombinant brew yeast ag 2015 the limits of detection lods of the different spe meln and dgt yes are for 17β estradiol 7 20e 11 g l and 1 04e 09 g l respectively the spe meln assay appeared more sensitive compared to the dgt yes assay however both assays ensure quantification in the ng l 1 range thus the eeqs detected by the regional council during november 2013 were compared with those evaluated by this investigation in the same locations during january and february 2018 data arose from the monitoring just mentioned and the present study are compared in table 6 eeqs from both studies are generally in accordance at all sites investigated with the possibility that taupo upstream and at tuakau showed increased eeqs from 2013 to 2018 however more analysis would be required to confirm a deterioration of the water quality 4 conclusion endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs are compounds that interfere with endocrine homeostasis in animals and are of increasing concern ecologically estrogenic compounds natural and anthropogenic such as 17β estradiol e2 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 bisphenol a bpa and the analogue bisphenol af bpaf are one class of edcs and have been implicated in human and non human reproductive disorders and significant ecological impacts this study attempted to quantify e2 ee2 bpa and bpaf total estradiol equivalency quantities using a novel coupling of dgt hplc ms analysis with a biomarker based yeast estrogen screen the yes assay uses the saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains recombined in order to identify compounds that are human estrogen receptor herα active ag 2015 and among the others was selected due to its robustness test speed and relatively low cost dgt eluates were treated to be compatible with the yes assay theoretical estradiol equivalency quantities ceeq were calculated from dgt hplc ms analysis and experimental estradiol equivalency quantities eeq were calculated from the concatenated dgt yes assay selected monitoring of different stages of drinking and wastewater treatment confirmed the utility of the assay method and revealed possible increases in water borne estradiol equivalency due to treatment involving removal of particulate phases but confirmed the efficacy of treatment in reducing biologically active estrogenic compounds discrepancies between ceeq and eeq were apparent at some stages of treatment possibly due to dgt eluates being enriched by other estrogenic compounds not determined by hplc analysis this divergence was particularly observed at early treatment stages sedimentation and secondary clarification where ceeq underestimated the total estradiol equivalency quantities waikato river source to outfall monitoring using the same system revealed that ceeq and eeq were higher downstream at all sites along the river eeqs increased from the source to the outfall with peak activities at hamilton and huntly after the outlets of wastewater treatment plants that serve these main urban areas dgt hplc ms and dgt yes assay hyphenation provided a correct total estrogenic potency evaluation moreover ceeq and eeq showed always consistent trends in particular dgt yes assay and the correspondent eeq is a fast and convenient approach that allows in a single measurement to capture all of the estrogenic compounds rather than just the ones with analytical standards representing better the real estrogenic disruption especially at the most polluted sites dgt hpc ms and the correspondent ceeq resulted to correctly predict the estrogenic disruption only in the case of a comprehensive analytes screening thus matching the values obtainable with the bioassay eeq this study demonstrated that this type of dgt could be suitable for passive sampling and accumulation of estrogenic compounds that can be evaluated for their total estrogenic activity using the yes assay but better congruency between the ceeq and eeq values requires a more complete identification of all major compounds accumulated that might contribute to total estrogenic potency credit authorship contribution statement helena iuele conceptualization

15923,occurring worldwide blooms of raphidiopsis raciborskii threaten the use of water resources especially in tropical and subtropical waterbodies its high flexibility in the uses of light and macronutrients c n p frustrates any bloom prediction and control based on macronutrients regulation to identify the critical factors promoting periodic blooms of r raciborskii the trends of meteorological hydrodynamic physical and chemical variables including macro and micronutrients n p fe were analyzed in a chinese tropical large reservoir dashahe reservoir over five years it was hypothesized that fe availability mediated by the mixing pattern of the reservoir played a crucial role in the periodic blooms of the cyanobacterium to have a more complete understanding the effects of fe on growth of a local r raciborskii strain were tested in a monoculture experiment the biomass and relative abundance of r raciborskii in the reservoir showed a clear seasonal trend with relative abundance 50 in summer autumn july to october three habitat types along a dominance gradient were identified in the reservoir and 17 variables were used to compare them statistical analysis and habitat comparison showed that temperature and stratification dissolved fe and n concentrations in the epilimnion and dissolved fe and oxygen concentrations in the hypolimnion were the critical factors driving the dynamics of r raciborskii in the study reservoir the habitat dominated by r raciborskii was characterized by a relatively low availability of macro resources zeu zm 1 srp 0 01 mg l din 0 3 mg l and by a high fe availability supplemented from hypoxic hypolimnion the dependence of growth on fe concentration increase was confirmed in culture where the maximum was reached at 0 689 mg fe l our results suggest that a high fe bioavailability also originating from the hypoxic hypolimnion influences the dynamics r raciborskii and favors the blooms of the species as a consequence fe concentrations in the water column as well as oxygen measurements along the water column should be routinely included in the monitoring programs aimed at predicting and controlling r raciborskii blooms the growth of raphidiopsis raciborskii is enhanced by a rich iron supply from the hypoxic hypolimnion resulting from seasonal stratification image graphical abstract keywords r raciborskii fe habitat characteristics limiting effects dominance tropical reservoir 1 introduction blooms of the cyanobacterium raphidiopsis raciborskii formerly cylindrospermopsis raciborskii are occurring worldwide in lakes reservoirs and rivers at increasing frequency and magnitude antunes et al 2015 these events threaten the utilization of water resources e g drinking supply recreation and aquaculture because the species produce toxins and cause water quality degradation burford et al 2016 the quite rapid geographical expansion of r raciborskii padisák 1997 has been attributed to the ecophysiological plasticity of this species with diverse strains and ecotypes piccini et al 2011 and to global warming sinha et al 2012 a high level of flexibility with respect to availability and uptake of nutrients particularly nitrogen n and phosphorus p also offers to this species an advantage over other members of the phytoplankton assemblage burford et al 2016 this high flexibility frustrated the bloom control by decreasing n and p supply in tropical lakes and reservoirs huszar et al 2000 lei et al 2018 reinl et al 2021 lu et al 2022 and suggested that a better knowledge about the multi dimensional niche of the species is needed to predict r raciborskii dynamics and dominance in warm waters facey et al 2019 hofmann et al 2021 several studies from tropical china brazil and africa have shown that a decreased n availability was among the principal causes explaining the dominance of r raciborskii e g huszar et al 2000 lei et al 2014 mowe et al 2015 lu et al 2022 the metabolic processes to assimilate and fix nitrogen are mediated by enzymes as nitrate reductase nr nitrite reductase nir and nitrogenase nit all bearing a cofactor containing iron fe milligan and harrison 2000 behrenfeld and milligan 2013 jiang et al 2018 a sufficient fe bio availability is thus required for the functioning of these metalloenzyme and for the consequent n assimilation behrenfeld and milligan 2013 jiang et al 2018 fu et al 2019 recently showed that the fe uptake rate of r raciborskii cells under n deficient conditions was threefold compared to that of cells incubated with repleted nitrate fe has been identified as an essential micronutrient influencing phytoplankton proliferation due to its physiological functions in a multitude of biological processes including not only nitrogen fixing and assimilation but also oxygenic photosynthesis and respiration borowitzka et al 2016 thus a growing awareness has been recently achieved that freshwater phytoplankton growth and structure can also be regulated by micronutrients i e trace metals alone or in cooperation with n and p downs et al 2008 molot et al 2010 2014 xu et al 2013 wu et al 2022 a few field investigations have tested the effect of fe concentrations and the synergistic effect of n or p and fe on the growth of r raciborskii facey et al 2021 havens 2012 proposed that the nitrate drawdown in lake erie was the result of fe increase because of enhanced utilization of nitrogen identifying the role of fe and its interplay with other variables in the multidimensional set of environmental factors that defines the niche of the species could contribute to clarify what are the mechanisms triggering r raciborskii blooms in freshwater ecosystems in spite of its biological importance and abundance on earth s surface fe is relatively unavailable to the biota in euphotic layer since the element at circum neutral ph values and in an oxidizing environment is poorly soluble and precipitates in the sediments earhart and lei 2015 a high seasonal variability in fe bioavailability in the epilimnion was detected in chinese tropical reservoirs depending on the oxygen availability in the hypolimnion yang et al 2017 xiao et al 2021 this variability was driven by thermal stratification and its effects on hypolimnetic oxygen and ph values and the fe supply in the epilimnion significantly depended on the concentrations of this element in the hypoxic hypolimnion xiao et al 2021 these results suggested that not only fe availability but also water physical and hydrodynamics conditions should be considered in describing the realized niche of r raciborskii hutchinson 1957 defined the fundamental niche as an n dimensional hyper volume whose dimensions are represented by the range of variability of all the environmental variables that concur to the existence of a species in the absence of biological interactions e g competition and or predation natural populations occupy what is commonly defined as local realized niche i e the subset of actual conditions including biological interactions where a population or a species shows a positive growth marrone et al 2022 a better knowledge of the critical niche axes for phytoplankton their range of effectiveness on the different species and of the patterns of environmental variability within which a species can still persist would be thus necessary to fully understand the dynamics of phytoplankton including cyanobacteria in aquatic ecosystems in particular not only the resources themselves but also the factors driving the variability of their supply should be considered as postulated by the phytoplankton habitat template theory the comparison of multi dimensional habitats i e local niches realized under different environmental and biological conditions is a useful method to compare the role of environmental factors in determining the most suitable set of conditions for phytoplankton species in the field reynolds 1998 reynolds et al 2002 padisák et al 2009 padisák and naselli flores 2021 in the tropical reservoirs of southern china r raciborskii is widely distributed and its dominance has been likely promoted by the decline of n and p after these reservoirs underwent eutrophication control in recent years xiao et al 2021 lei et al 2021 lu et al 2022 seasonal r raciborskii blooms repeatedly occurred in these reservoirs challenging the detection of the habitats characteristics that beyond n and p availability could favor the dominance of the species considering the importance of fe in the utilization of n and p and its essential role in metabolic processes in this paper we wish to elucidate how the effect of fe availability influences biomass accumulation and dominance of r raciborskii also considering the meteorological hydrodynamic physical and chemical variables which modulate the availability of this microelement it is thus hypothesized that i fe plays an important role in cooperation with n and p in supporting the ability of r raciborskii to outcompete other phytoplankton species and that ii this role is modulated by the hydrodynamic conditions of water bodies to test the hypotheses the main meteorological hydrodynamic physical and chemical variables and r raciborskii population dynamics were investigated in a tropical large reservoir dashahe reservoir southern china over a period of five years to assess the importance of all the considered environmental variables a comprehensive method coupling regression analysis and habitat comparison was used we did not consider zooplankton grazing as a critical factor in our study since this large filamentous species do not represent a suitable food for zooplankton padisák 1997 naselli flores et al 2007 moreover zooplankton is commonly characterized by small size and has a weak grazing effect on the species in the study reservoir xi et al 2015 to complete our investigation the effects of fe availability on the growth of a local commonly occurring r raciborskii strain were tested in a monoculture experiment 2 methods 2 1 field investigation 2 1 1 study site and local climate dashahe

circinale xiao et al 2007 the reservoir and its watershed underwent a basin wide eutrophication control program which resulted in a significant decrease of d circinale yuan et al 2015 however in recent years in spite of the further reduction of nutrient concentrations and loads recurrent blooms of raphidiopsis raciborskii have affected the reservoir the reservoir is subjected to a tropical

showed a quite regular seasonal trend fig 2 a r raciborskii dominance relative abundance 50 and bloom biomass 10 mg l generally occurred from june to october and the population abundance reached its annual minima in february march fig 2b in other periods april to may and november to january the presence of the species was irregular with large variation of biomass and relative abundance fig 2b among the 65 samples analyzed 34 were allocated in the habitat type i good conditions 30 in habitat type ii moderately good conditions and 36 in habitat type iii poor conditions fig 2c 3 2 meteorological and hydrodynamic conditions according to the tropical monsoon climate average annual precipitation was 2226 623 mm with a clear seasonal pattern the wet season was from april to october and the dry season from november to march the precipitation pattern contributed to the seasonality of water retention time rt and the large volume of the reservoir stored the inflow and prevented serious wash out to occur as a result the rt was never lower than 70 days water column mixing proportion wcmp was below 100 and indicated water stratification from april to october whereas a value of 100 indicated whole mixing in other periods the seasonality of stratification mixing is typical of warm monomictic conditions the high precipitation sometime storms with more than 100 mm of precipitation per day were never able to break the thermocline during the stratification period fig 3 a as regard the three meteorological and hydrodynamic variables considered in the present study the habitat type i was characterized by significantly lower rt values than those occurring in type ii and iii p 0 05 anosim 3 3 physical and chemical conditions the tropical climate also contributed to warm water temperature values in the whole year the surface water temperature t was generally above 15 c in winter except for the cold winter in 2017 when t reached 13 c and up to 32 c in summer relative water column stability rwcs was determined by the relative density difference between surface and bottom water which reflected the warm monomictic conditions of the reservoir circulation generally occurred between the end of november and the end of march with a nearly isothermal water column and rwcs close to 0 the depth of the thermocline during stratification periods fluctuated among months and years and a high variability in the zeu zm ratio ranging from 0 3 to 4 9 was recorded in the study period nevertheless the zeu zm ratio was 1 for most of the study period the high surface water temperature values during stratification periods were associated to slight increases of ph values in surface water and to pronounced decrease of bottom dissolved oxygen concentration bdo which reached values close to 0 from may to august fig 4 b significant differences p 0 05 anosim were detected in t and bdo in the three habitat types the habitat type i was characterized by significant higher p 0 05 anosim surface water temperatures and anaerobic conditions at the bottom compared to the other two habitats fig 4c total nitrogen etn and total phosphorus etp ranged from 0 45 mg l to 1 67 mg l and from 0 014 mg l to 0 059 mg l respectively and their average values were 0 99 0 3 mg l and 0 030 0 008 mg l respectively the reservoir showed meso to eutrophic conditions according to tp and tn concentrations soluble reactive phosphorus esrp values were rather constant during the investigated period with an average of 0 005 0 003 mg l during stratification bsrp values although generally below 0 01 mg l were higher than those recorded at the surface suggesting a slightly release of this nutrient from the sediments and contributing to the slight increase of etp fig 5 a more edin was partly incorporated into organic nitrogen in the stratification period leading to a continuous decrease of edin in particular a progressive and significant increase in bdfe under anaerobic condition was observed in the bottom waters during the stratification periods in the five years of investigation with maximum bdfe concentrations reaching 6 2 mg l an increase of edfe was also observed associated with the rise of bdfe concentrations in the anaerobic hypolimnion as regard nutrients the habitat type i was characterized by significantly higher values of edfe and bdfe and lower edin compared to habitat type iii p 0 05 anosim with reference to esrp no statistically significant differences occurred among the three habitats fig 5b 3 4 statistical and multi dimensional comparison of habitats fourteen environmental variables significantly correlated spearman p 0 05 to r raciborskii relative abundance and or biomass and they were selected to characterize its environment in a pca biplot fig 6 a the first two axes cumulatively explained 50 of the variance of the relative abundance of the species and the three identified habitat types were markedly separated the partial analysis of the explanatory value of significant hydrodynamic rt and wcmp physical t and rwcs and chemical bdo and nutrients variables were 26 38 and 45 respectively for biomass and were 5 33 and 48 respectively for relative abundance the results showed the strong and complex coupling or co linear relationships between the fourteen variables which altogether explained more than 40 of r raciborskii variation the coupling or co linearity between variables caused difficulties in identifying the effect of individual variable on the dynamics of r raciborskii population the habitat comparison simplified the task and only seven variables rt t edin edfe bod bsrp bdfe showed significant difference p 0 05 anosim between habitat type i good conditions and habitat type iii poor conditions moreover rwcs with p 0 05 in anosim was also considered these eight variables were selected to describe the habitat template of r raciborskii in the study reservoir and to highlight the differences characterizing the three identified habitat types r raciborskii dominated the habitat characterized by lower edin higher edfe and t conditions higher bdfe and bsrp in hypoxic hypolimnion conversely its population collapsed in the habitat with oxygented hypolimnion even if the edin was high fig 6c a synthesis of these results is shown in fig 6d which summarizes the most relevant physical and chemical features of r raciborskii habitat type i good conditions for its growth and dominance and habitat type iii poor conditions for its growth 3 5 laboratory experiment on fe availability and raphidiopsis raciborskii growth the highest measured growth rates of r raciborskii n8 were attained in the treatments with the highest fe concentrations 0 689 mg l and 1 378 mg l and their value was about 0 10 0 002 d 1 fig 7 the minimum growth rate occurred in the treatments with no added fe and with 0 00689 mg l fe concentration no significant differences in chl a concentration 8 0 1 3 μg l were detected in these two treatments at the end of the experiment the growth rates were significantly different anova p 0 05 n 8 in the treatments with fe concentrations lower than 0 689 mg l and followed a decreasing trend as the fe concentrations decreased in the treatments fig 7 4 discussion the wax and wane of extant phytoplankton populations can be controlled by dozens of factors in the field and identifying what are those limiting growth and eventually causing losses is important to understand the temporal and spatial variability in the population abundance reynolds 1998 padisák et al 2009 padisák and naselli flores 2021 the dynamics of phytoplankton populations in a given habitat depend on several environmental constraints including temperature light availability nutrient concentrations mixing depth hydraulic regime zooplankton grazing etc according to the habitat template approach developed by reynolds 1998 all these variables contribute to determine the recruitment and dominance of phytoplankton species in fact depending on the value and combination of these variables some species will conform better than others to a given pattern of ecological conditions which defines the local realized niche of those species following this approach we identified and analyzed three different environmental patterns habitat type i ii and iii occurring in dashahe reservoir and characterized by a progressively decreasing abundance of raphidiopsis raciborskii our results showed that the habitat comparison was an effective approach in order to identify the critical conditions which drive the population dynamics of r raciborskii this approach allowed to select 7 physical and chemical t wcrs edin edfe bdfe bsrp and bod variables and one hydrodynamic variable rt useful to explain r raciborskii population dominance and collapse high water temperature is crucial for the growth of r raciborskii which is considered a tropical planktic genus padisák 1997 frequently blooming in tropical and subtropical regions antunes et al 2015 burford et al 2016 culture experiments have shown that r raciborskii could grow well at temperature above 16 c with optimum values at 28 c 32 c yu et al 2014 ruan et al 2018 in the tropical reservoir dashahe as well as in other reservoirs of the region water temperatures showed values mostly above 16 c moreover year round r raciborskii blooms have been recorded in some reservoirs in the vicinity of dashahe reservoir lei et al 2018 tang et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 therefore water temperature alone unlikely limited the species growth in dashahe reservoir even considering the unusually cold waters t 13 c recorded in 2017 in addition water temperature also determines the duration and strength of stratification and a decrease of the mixing depth as shown by the lower wcmp percentages recorded during the stratification period a decreased depth and low flushing rates corresponding to high rt where found to favor the biomass accumulation of low light adapted cyanobacteria in a circulating reservoir in southern china tang et al 2021 however in the deeper and larger dashahe reservoir low rt were typical of habitat type i and ii i e those habitats showing good to moderately good growth conditions for r raciborskii considering that water abstraction in the reservoir generally occurs from outlets located in its deepest layers below the thermocline 4 meters from the bottom the low retention time lowest value was 70 days was probably not effective in flushing out the species growing in the epilimnion and in reducing its relative abundance and biomass as reported in literature tolerance to low light levels can contribute to the dominance of r raciborskii briand et al 2004 in our investigations the ratio of zeu zmix was mostly below 1 indicating that poor light conditions frequently characterize the reservoir s water column poor light conditions might be attributed to the disturbance exerted by meteorological and hydrodynamic variables in the monsoon season increased turbidity due to high flushing and to the deepening of the mixing zone induced by decreasing temperature in dry season the role of macro nutrients c n p in determining the growth of r raciborskii was extensively investigated in literature and its competitiveness with regard to c n and p availability was extensively assessed antunes et al 2015 burford et al 2016 and literature therein in the present investigation din the main source of nitrogen for phytoplankton growth was identified as one important factor explaining the variance of r raciborskii biomass and relative abundance r raciborskii has the ability to fix and store nitrogen and can utilize a range of different nitrogen sources this ability offers to the species a competitive advantage under low and fluctuating dissolved nitrogen concentrations moisander et al 2012 lu et al 2022 the negative correlation between din concentrations and r raciborskii biomass and relative abundance suggests that nitrogen was not a limiting factor for r raciborskii growth and the decrease of din recorded in the first half of the year might be due to its effective utilization from phytoplankton contemporary srp concentrations were almost constantly 10 μg l at the surface of the reservoir r raciborskii is known to have high p uptake and storage capacity which make the species more competitive under low p availability compared to other phytoplankton species istvánovics et al 2000 wu et al 2009 and enable it to dominate under a wide range of phosphorus levels chislock et al 2014 as regard c availability all cyanobacteria possess an active co2 concentrating mechanism giordano et al 2005 moreover r raciborskii can efficiently utilize bicarbonate holland et al 2012 and thrive in a wide range of ph values bonilla et al 2012 bicarbonate is present in the ph range 4 11 with a peak at ph 8 3 where it represents the exclusive form of available c padisák and naselli flores 2021 such ph values in our study were more often characterizing habitat type i good conditions rather than moderately good and poor habitat types ii and iii these results reconfirmed the flexible strategy adopted by r raciborskii with regard to n p and c uptake and the challenge that may represent the management of this species through the control of n and p availability antunes et al 2015 burford et al 2016 taking in account the environmental fe availability a significant positive correlation between fe concentration and r raciborskii population increase emerged both in the field and under experimental conditions the field investigation in dashahe reservoir showed that the most suitable habitat type i of r raciborskii was characterized by high epilimnetic dfe concentrations 0 02 mg l whose source was mostly derived from the hypoxic anoxic hypolimnion the growth experiment showed that r raciborskii population stopped growing at a fe concentration of 0 00689 mg l 0 1 μm and its maximum growth rate was attained at a concentration of 0 689 mg l 10 μm suggesting higher fe requirements than those needed by non nitrogen fixing algae jin et al 2009 both field and experiment results imply that r raciborskii growth strongly depended on fe availability fe is an essential microelement since it plays a crucial role in photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation and also contributes to regulate phosphorus bioavailability yong et al 2014 borowitzka et al 2016 more than 50 of metabolic fe occurs within the photosynthetic apparatus of phytoplankton photosynthetic pigments and pigment binding proteins would be reduced under fe stressed conditions strzepek harrison 2004 behrenfeld and milligan 2013 as shown by browning et al 2017 fe is a cofactor in several classes of microbial alkaline phosphatases and controls the coupling of nitrogen and phosphorus cycle in nutrient depleted aquatic ecosystems tan et al 2020 demonstrated that alkaline phosphatase activity and growth of r raciborskii strain n8 increased along with fe concentration allowing the cyanobacterium to grow in a medium only containing organic phosphorus d glucose 6 phosphate these authors suggested the important role that fe plays on r raciborskii growth in poor light and low phosphorus conditions moreover r raciborskii shows high ammonium and nitrate uptake affinity can utilize organic nitrogen and can store the element as cyanophycin granules and in the phycobiliproteins présing et al 1996 whitton and potts 2007 ruan et al 2018 lu et al 2022 fe is thus the most important cofactor to ensure this efficient use of nitrogen to r raciborskii such importance was further suggested by the strong coupling of fe supply and n utilization as shown by the significant correlation between din decrease and dfe increase in study reservoir all these results confirmed our first hypothesis i and implied that a rich fe supply is an important support for the competitiveness of the species since its availability makes possible the flexible strategy adopted by r raciborskii with respect to resource acquisition both light and macro nutrients it is important to remark that fe is a redox sensitive element and dissolved fe concentrations mostly depend on the gradients of oxygen and ph condition developing during stratification actually under oxygen rich conditions and alkaline ph values as those occurring in the epilimnion of waterbodies highly bioavailable fe2 is quickly transformed in insoluble fe3 and made unavailable to phytoplankton millero et al 1995 it is thus important to know the potential fe sources and their distribution in aquatic environment through space and time to fully understand the fe role on the dynamics of r raciborskii high water temperatures have effects on the stratification patterns of waterbodies and promoted hypoxic conditions in the hypolimnion of dashahe reservoirs which corresponded to an increase of bsrp and bdfe likely through their release from sediments gautreau et al 2020 qin et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 the increase of dfe concentrations in the bottom layer of the reservoir coincided with an increased availability of dfe and tfe in the epilimnion the mobilization of bioavailable fe from the sediments can thus explain the higher fe bioavailability recorded during the stratification period and the establishment of suitable habitat conditions type i that favored the formation of r raciborskii blooms these results supported our second hypothesis ii that hydrodynamic conditions modulated the role of fe on the dynamics of r raciborskii 5 conclusion the results of a study carried out both in the field and in the lab showed that r raciborskii a worldwide distributed and bloom forming diazotrophic cyanobacterium has higher requirements for bioavailable fe than non nitrogen fixing algae especially under conditions of n deficiency since this microelement is largely involved in the metabolic pathways of nitrogen utilization actually our investigation showed that the absolute dominance of r raciborskii occurred when the habitat turned to conditions characterized by high temperatures water stratification lowering of available nitrogen and an increased bio availability of fe the results achieved strongly suggest that fe bio availability is an important axis in the multidimensional space that defines the local realized niche of this cyanobacterium the range of variability of this axis affected the growth and dominance patterns of r raciborskii in the study reservoir and under appropriate circumstances allowed this species to outcompete other phytoplankton taxa up to forming almost monospecific assemblages the results indicate that dissolved fe availability should be therefore considered as important as that of other macronutrients n p or si for diatom commonly considered as fundamental variables governing the dynamics of phytoplankton and shaping their niches as a consequence fe concentrations in the water column as well as oxygen measurements along the water column should be routinely included in the monitoring programs aimed at predicting and controlling r raciborskii blooms moreover water management addressed at increasing hypolimnetic oxygenation during stratification could contribute to reduce fe bioavailability in reservoirs and limit the occurrence

15923,occurring worldwide blooms of raphidiopsis raciborskii threaten the use of water resources especially in tropical and subtropical waterbodies its high flexibility in the uses of light and macronutrients c n p frustrates any bloom prediction and control based on macronutrients regulation to identify the critical factors promoting periodic blooms of r raciborskii the trends of meteorological hydrodynamic physical and chemical variables including macro and micronutrients n p fe were analyzed in a chinese tropical large reservoir dashahe reservoir over five years it was hypothesized that fe availability mediated by the mixing pattern of the reservoir played a crucial role in the periodic blooms of the cyanobacterium to have a more complete understanding the effects of fe on growth of a local r raciborskii strain were tested in a monoculture experiment the biomass and relative abundance of r raciborskii in the reservoir showed a clear seasonal trend with relative abundance 50 in summer autumn july to october three habitat types along a dominance gradient were identified in the reservoir and 17 variables were used to compare them statistical analysis and habitat comparison showed that temperature and stratification dissolved fe and n concentrations in the epilimnion and dissolved fe and oxygen concentrations in the hypolimnion were the critical factors driving the dynamics of r raciborskii in the study reservoir the habitat dominated by r raciborskii was characterized by a relatively low availability of macro resources zeu zm 1 srp 0 01 mg l din 0 3 mg l and by a high fe availability supplemented from hypoxic hypolimnion the dependence of growth on fe concentration increase was confirmed in culture where the maximum was reached at 0 689 mg fe l our results suggest that a high fe bioavailability also originating from the hypoxic hypolimnion influences the dynamics r raciborskii and favors the blooms of the species as a consequence fe concentrations in the water column as well as oxygen measurements along the water column should be routinely included in the monitoring programs aimed at predicting and controlling r raciborskii

habitat characteristics limiting effects dominance tropical reservoir 1 introduction blooms of the cyanobacterium raphidiopsis raciborskii formerly cylindrospermopsis raciborskii are occurring worldwide in lakes reservoirs and rivers at increasing frequency and magnitude antunes et al 2015 these events threaten the utilization of water resources e g drinking supply recreation and aquaculture because the species produce toxins and cause water quality degradation burford et al 2016 the quite rapid geographical expansion of r raciborskii padisák 1997 has been attributed to the ecophysiological plasticity of this species with diverse strains and ecotypes piccini et al 2011 and to global warming sinha et al 2012 a high level of flexibility with respect to availability and uptake of nutrients particularly nitrogen n and phosphorus p also offers to this species an advantage over other members of the phytoplankton assemblage burford et al 2016 this high flexibility frustrated the bloom control by decreasing n and p supply in tropical lakes and reservoirs huszar et al 2000 lei et al 2018 reinl et al 2021 lu et al 2022 and suggested that a better knowledge about the multi dimensional niche of the species is needed to predict r raciborskii dynamics and dominance in warm waters facey et al 2019 hofmann et al 2021 several studies from tropical china brazil and africa have shown that a decreased n availability was among the principal causes explaining the dominance of r raciborskii e g huszar et al 2000 lei et al 2014 mowe et al 2015 lu et al 2022 the metabolic processes to assimilate and fix nitrogen are mediated by enzymes as nitrate reductase nr nitrite reductase nir and nitrogenase nit all bearing a cofactor containing iron fe milligan and harrison 2000 behrenfeld and milligan 2013 jiang et al 2018 a sufficient fe bio availability is thus required for the functioning of these metalloenzyme and for the consequent n assimilation behrenfeld and milligan 2013 jiang et al 2018 fu et al 2019 recently showed that the fe uptake rate of r raciborskii cells under n deficient conditions was threefold compared to that of cells incubated with repleted nitrate fe has been identified as an essential micronutrient influencing phytoplankton proliferation due to its physiological functions in a multitude of biological processes including not only nitrogen fixing and assimilation but also oxygenic photosynthesis and respiration borowitzka et al 2016 thus a growing awareness has been recently achieved that freshwater phytoplankton growth and structure can also be regulated by micronutrients i e trace metals alone or in cooperation with n and p downs et al 2008 molot et al 2010 2014 xu et al 2013 wu et al 2022 a few field investigations have tested the effect of fe concentrations and the synergistic effect of n or p and fe on the growth of r raciborskii facey et al 2021 havens 2012 proposed that the nitrate drawdown in lake erie was the result of fe increase because of enhanced utilization of nitrogen identifying the role of fe and its interplay with other variables in the multidimensional set of environmental factors that defines the niche of the species could contribute to clarify what are the mechanisms triggering r raciborskii blooms in freshwater ecosystems in spite of its biological importance and abundance on earth s surface fe is relatively unavailable to the biota in euphotic layer since the element at circum neutral ph values and in an oxidizing environment is poorly soluble and precipitates in the sediments earhart and lei 2015 a high seasonal variability in fe bioavailability in the epilimnion was detected in chinese tropical reservoirs depending on the oxygen availability in the hypolimnion yang et al 2017 xiao et al 2021 this variability was driven by thermal stratification and its effects on hypolimnetic oxygen and ph values and the fe supply in the epilimnion significantly depended on the concentrations of this element in the hypoxic hypolimnion xiao et al 2021 these results suggested that not only fe availability but also water physical and hydrodynamics conditions should be considered in describing the realized niche of r raciborskii hutchinson 1957 defined the fundamental niche as an n dimensional hyper volume whose dimensions are represented by the range of variability of all the environmental variables that concur to the existence of a species in the absence of biological interactions e g competition and or predation natural populations occupy what is commonly defined as local realized niche i e the subset of actual conditions including biological interactions where a population or a species shows a positive growth marrone et al 2022 a better knowledge of the critical niche axes for phytoplankton their range of effectiveness on the different species and of the patterns of environmental variability within which a species can still persist would be thus necessary to fully understand the dynamics of phytoplankton including cyanobacteria in aquatic ecosystems in particular not only the resources themselves but also the factors driving the variability of their supply should be considered as postulated by the phytoplankton habitat template theory the comparison of multi dimensional habitats i e local niches realized under different environmental and biological conditions is a useful method to compare the role of environmental factors in determining the most suitable set of conditions for phytoplankton species in the field reynolds 1998 reynolds et al 2002 padisák et al 2009 padisák and naselli flores 2021 in the tropical reservoirs of southern china r raciborskii is widely distributed and its dominance has been likely promoted by the decline of n and p after these reservoirs underwent eutrophication control in recent years xiao et al 2021 lei et al 2021 lu et al 2022 seasonal r raciborskii blooms repeatedly occurred in these reservoirs challenging the detection of the habitats characteristics that beyond n and p availability could favor the dominance of the species considering the importance of fe in the utilization of n and p and its essential role in metabolic processes in this paper we wish to elucidate how the effect of fe availability influences biomass accumulation and dominance of r raciborskii also considering the meteorological hydrodynamic physical and chemical variables which modulate the availability of this microelement it is thus hypothesized that i fe plays an important role in cooperation with n and p in supporting the ability of r raciborskii to outcompete other phytoplankton species and that ii this role is modulated by the hydrodynamic conditions of water bodies to test the hypotheses the main meteorological hydrodynamic physical and chemical variables and r raciborskii population dynamics were investigated in a tropical large reservoir dashahe reservoir southern china over a period of five years to assess the importance of all the considered environmental variables a comprehensive method coupling regression analysis and habitat comparison was used we did not consider zooplankton grazing as a critical factor in our study since this large filamentous species do not represent a suitable food for zooplankton padisák 1997 naselli flores et al 2007 moreover zooplankton is commonly characterized by small size and has a weak grazing effect on the species in the study reservoir xi et al 2015 to complete our investigation the effects of fe availability on the growth of a local commonly occurring r raciborskii strain were tested in a monoculture experiment 2 methods 2 1 field investigation 2 1 1 study site and local climate dashahe

showed a quite regular seasonal trend fig 2 a r raciborskii dominance relative abundance 50 and bloom biomass 10 mg l generally occurred from june to october and the population abundance reached its annual minima in february march fig 2b in other periods april to may and november to january the presence of the species was irregular with large variation of biomass and relative abundance fig 2b among the 65 samples analyzed 34 were allocated in the habitat type i good conditions 30 in habitat type ii moderately good conditions and 36 in habitat type iii poor conditions fig 2c 3 2 meteorological and hydrodynamic conditions according to the tropical monsoon climate average annual precipitation was 2226 623 mm with a clear seasonal pattern the wet season was from april to october and the dry season from november to march the precipitation pattern contributed to the seasonality of water retention time rt and the large volume of the reservoir stored the inflow and prevented serious wash out to occur as a result the rt was never lower than 70 days water column mixing proportion wcmp was below 100 and indicated water stratification from april to october whereas a value of 100 indicated whole mixing in other periods the seasonality of stratification mixing is typical of warm monomictic conditions the high precipitation sometime storms with more than 100 mm of precipitation per day were never able to break the thermocline during the stratification period fig 3 a as regard the three meteorological and hydrodynamic variables considered in the present study the habitat type i was characterized by significantly lower rt values than those occurring in type ii and iii p 0 05 anosim 3 3 physical and chemical conditions the tropical climate also contributed to warm water temperature values in the whole year the surface water temperature t was generally above 15 c in winter except for the cold winter in 2017 when t reached 13 c and up to 32 c in summer relative water column stability rwcs was determined by the relative density difference between surface and bottom water which reflected the warm monomictic conditions of the reservoir circulation generally occurred between the end of november and the end of march with a nearly isothermal water column and rwcs close to 0 the depth of the thermocline during stratification periods fluctuated among months and years and a high variability in the zeu zm ratio ranging from 0 3 to 4 9 was recorded in the study period nevertheless the zeu zm ratio was 1 for most of the study period the high surface water temperature values during stratification periods were associated to slight increases of ph values in surface water and to pronounced decrease of bottom dissolved oxygen concentration bdo which reached values close to 0 from may to august fig 4 b significant differences p 0 05 anosim were detected in t and bdo in the three habitat types the habitat type i was characterized by significant higher p 0 05 anosim surface water temperatures and anaerobic conditions at the bottom compared to the other two habitats fig 4c total nitrogen etn and total phosphorus etp ranged from 0 45 mg l to 1 67 mg l and from 0 014 mg l to 0 059 mg l respectively and their average values were 0 99 0 3 mg l and 0 030 0 008 mg l respectively the reservoir showed meso to eutrophic conditions according to tp and tn concentrations soluble reactive phosphorus esrp values were rather constant during the investigated period with an average of 0 005 0 003 mg l during stratification bsrp values although generally below 0 01 mg l were higher than those recorded at the surface suggesting a slightly release of this nutrient from the sediments and contributing to the slight increase of etp fig 5 a more edin was partly incorporated into organic nitrogen in the stratification period leading to a continuous decrease of edin in particular a progressive and significant increase in bdfe under anaerobic condition was observed in the bottom waters during the stratification periods in the five years of investigation with maximum bdfe concentrations reaching 6 2 mg l an increase of edfe was also observed associated with the rise of bdfe concentrations in the anaerobic hypolimnion as regard nutrients the habitat type i was characterized by significantly higher values of edfe and bdfe and lower edin compared to habitat type iii p 0 05 anosim with reference to esrp no statistically significant differences occurred among the three habitats fig 5b 3 4 statistical and multi dimensional comparison of habitats fourteen environmental variables significantly correlated spearman p 0 05 to r raciborskii relative abundance and or biomass and they were selected to characterize its environment in a pca biplot fig 6 a the first two axes cumulatively explained 50 of the variance of the relative abundance of the species and the three identified habitat types were markedly separated the partial analysis of the explanatory value of significant hydrodynamic rt and wcmp physical t and rwcs and chemical bdo and nutrients variables were 26 38 and 45 respectively for biomass and were 5 33 and 48 respectively for relative abundance the results showed the strong and complex coupling or co linear relationships between the fourteen variables which altogether explained more than 40 of r raciborskii variation the coupling or co linearity between variables caused difficulties in identifying the effect of individual variable on the dynamics of r raciborskii population the habitat comparison simplified the task and only seven variables rt t edin edfe bod bsrp bdfe showed significant difference p 0 05 anosim between habitat type i good conditions and habitat type iii poor conditions moreover rwcs with p 0 05 in anosim was also considered these eight variables were selected to describe the habitat template of r raciborskii in the study reservoir and to highlight the differences characterizing the three identified habitat types r raciborskii dominated the habitat characterized by lower edin higher edfe and t conditions higher bdfe and bsrp in hypoxic hypolimnion conversely its population collapsed in the habitat with oxygented hypolimnion even if the edin was high fig 6c a synthesis of these results is shown in fig 6d which summarizes the most relevant physical and chemical features of r raciborskii habitat type i good conditions for its growth and dominance and habitat type iii poor conditions for its growth 3 5 laboratory experiment on fe availability and raphidiopsis raciborskii growth the highest measured growth rates of r raciborskii n8 were attained in the treatments with the highest fe concentrations 0 689 mg l and 1 378 mg l and their value was about 0 10 0 002 d 1 fig 7 the minimum growth rate occurred in the treatments with no added fe and with 0 00689 mg l fe concentration no significant differences in chl a concentration 8 0 1 3 μg l were detected in these two treatments at the end of the experiment the growth rates were significantly different anova p 0 05 n 8 in the treatments with fe concentrations lower than 0 689 mg l and followed a decreasing trend as the fe concentrations decreased in the treatments fig 7 4 discussion the wax and wane of extant phytoplankton populations can be controlled by dozens of factors in the field and identifying what are those limiting growth and eventually causing losses is important to understand the temporal and spatial variability in the population abundance reynolds 1998 padisák et al 2009 padisák and naselli flores 2021 the dynamics of phytoplankton populations in a given habitat depend on several environmental constraints including temperature light availability nutrient concentrations mixing depth hydraulic regime zooplankton grazing etc according to the habitat template approach developed by reynolds 1998 all these variables contribute to determine the recruitment and dominance of phytoplankton species in fact depending on the value and combination of these variables some species will conform better than others to a given pattern of ecological conditions which defines the local realized niche of those species following this approach we identified and analyzed three different environmental patterns habitat type i ii and iii occurring in dashahe reservoir and characterized by a progressively decreasing abundance of raphidiopsis raciborskii our results showed that the habitat comparison was an effective approach in order to identify the critical conditions which drive the population dynamics of r raciborskii this approach allowed to select 7 physical and chemical t wcrs edin edfe bdfe bsrp and bod variables and one hydrodynamic variable rt useful to explain r raciborskii population dominance and collapse high water temperature is crucial for the growth of r raciborskii which is considered a tropical planktic genus padisák 1997 frequently blooming in tropical and subtropical regions antunes et al 2015 burford et al 2016 culture experiments have shown that r raciborskii could grow well at temperature above 16 c with optimum values at 28 c 32 c yu et al 2014 ruan et al 2018 in the tropical reservoir dashahe as well as in other reservoirs of the region water temperatures showed values mostly above 16 c moreover year round r raciborskii blooms have been recorded in some reservoirs in the vicinity of dashahe reservoir lei et al 2018 tang et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 therefore water temperature alone unlikely limited the species growth in dashahe reservoir even considering the unusually cold waters t 13 c recorded in 2017 in addition water temperature also determines the duration and strength of stratification and a decrease of the mixing depth as shown by the lower wcmp percentages recorded during the stratification period a decreased depth and low flushing rates corresponding to high rt where found to favor the biomass accumulation of low light adapted cyanobacteria in a circulating reservoir in southern china tang et al 2021 however in the deeper and larger dashahe reservoir low rt were typical of habitat type i and ii i e those habitats showing good to moderately good growth conditions for r raciborskii considering that water abstraction in the reservoir generally occurs from outlets located in its deepest layers below the thermocline 4 meters from the bottom the low retention time lowest value was 70 days was probably not effective in flushing out the species growing in the epilimnion and in reducing its relative abundance and biomass as reported in literature tolerance to low light levels can contribute to the dominance of r raciborskii briand et al 2004 in our investigations the ratio of zeu zmix was mostly below 1 indicating that poor light conditions frequently characterize the reservoir s water column poor light conditions might be attributed to the disturbance exerted by meteorological and hydrodynamic variables in the monsoon season increased turbidity due to high flushing and to the deepening of the mixing zone induced by decreasing temperature in dry season the role of macro nutrients c n p in determining the growth of r raciborskii was extensively investigated in literature and its competitiveness with regard to c n and p availability was extensively assessed antunes et al 2015 burford et al 2016 and literature therein in the present investigation din the main source of nitrogen for phytoplankton growth was identified as one important factor explaining the variance of r raciborskii biomass and relative abundance r raciborskii has the ability to fix and store nitrogen and can utilize a range of different nitrogen sources this ability offers to the species a competitive advantage under low and fluctuating dissolved nitrogen concentrations moisander et al 2012 lu et al 2022 the negative correlation between din concentrations and r raciborskii biomass and relative abundance suggests that nitrogen was not a limiting factor for r raciborskii growth and the decrease of din recorded in the first half of the year might be due to its effective utilization from phytoplankton contemporary srp concentrations were almost constantly 10 μg l at the surface of the reservoir r raciborskii is known to have high p uptake and storage capacity which make the species more competitive under low p availability compared to other phytoplankton species istvánovics et al 2000 wu et al 2009 and enable it to dominate under a wide range of phosphorus levels chislock et al 2014 as regard c availability all cyanobacteria possess an active co2 concentrating mechanism giordano et al 2005 moreover r raciborskii can efficiently utilize bicarbonate holland et al 2012 and thrive in a wide range of ph values bonilla et al 2012 bicarbonate is present in the ph range 4 11 with a peak at ph 8 3 where it represents the exclusive form of available c padisák and naselli flores 2021 such ph values in our study were more often characterizing habitat type i good conditions rather than moderately good and poor habitat types ii and iii these results reconfirmed the flexible strategy adopted by r raciborskii with regard to n p and c uptake and the challenge that may represent the management of this species through the control of n and p availability antunes et al 2015 burford et al 2016 taking in account the environmental fe availability a significant positive correlation between fe concentration and r raciborskii population increase emerged both in the field and under experimental conditions the field investigation in dashahe reservoir showed that the most suitable habitat type i of r raciborskii was characterized by high epilimnetic dfe concentrations 0 02 mg l whose source was mostly derived from the hypoxic anoxic hypolimnion the growth experiment showed that r raciborskii population stopped growing at a fe concentration of 0 00689 mg l 0 1 μm and its maximum growth rate was attained at a concentration of 0 689 mg l 10 μm suggesting higher fe requirements than those needed by non nitrogen fixing algae jin et al 2009 both field and experiment results imply that r raciborskii growth strongly depended on fe availability fe is an essential microelement since it plays a crucial role in photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation and also contributes to regulate phosphorus bioavailability yong et al 2014 borowitzka et al 2016 more than 50 of metabolic fe occurs within the photosynthetic apparatus of phytoplankton photosynthetic pigments and pigment binding proteins would be reduced under fe stressed conditions strzepek harrison 2004 behrenfeld and milligan 2013 as shown by browning et al 2017 fe is a cofactor in several classes of microbial alkaline phosphatases and controls the coupling of nitrogen and phosphorus cycle in nutrient depleted aquatic ecosystems tan et al 2020 demonstrated that alkaline phosphatase activity and growth of r raciborskii strain n8 increased along with fe concentration allowing the cyanobacterium to grow in a medium only containing organic phosphorus d glucose 6 phosphate these authors suggested the important role that fe plays on r raciborskii growth in poor light and low phosphorus conditions moreover r raciborskii shows high ammonium and nitrate uptake affinity can utilize organic nitrogen and can store the element as cyanophycin granules and in the phycobiliproteins présing et al 1996 whitton and potts 2007 ruan et al 2018 lu et al 2022 fe is thus the most important cofactor to ensure this efficient use of nitrogen to r raciborskii such importance was further suggested by the strong coupling of fe supply and n utilization as shown by the significant correlation between din decrease and dfe increase in study reservoir all these results confirmed our first hypothesis i and implied that a rich fe supply is an important support for the competitiveness of the species since its availability makes possible the flexible strategy adopted by r raciborskii with respect to resource acquisition both light and macro nutrients it is important to remark that fe is a redox sensitive element and dissolved fe concentrations mostly depend on the gradients of oxygen and ph condition developing during stratification actually under oxygen rich conditions and alkaline ph values as those occurring in the epilimnion of waterbodies highly bioavailable fe2 is quickly transformed in insoluble fe3 and made unavailable to phytoplankton millero et al 1995 it is thus important to know the potential fe sources and their distribution in aquatic environment through space and time to fully understand the fe role on the dynamics of r raciborskii high water temperatures have effects on the stratification patterns of waterbodies and promoted hypoxic conditions in the hypolimnion of dashahe reservoirs which corresponded to an increase of bsrp and bdfe likely through their release from sediments gautreau et al 2020 qin et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 the increase of dfe concentrations in the bottom layer of the reservoir coincided with an increased availability of dfe and tfe in the epilimnion the mobilization of bioavailable fe from the sediments can thus explain the higher fe bioavailability recorded during the stratification period and the establishment of suitable habitat conditions type i that favored the formation of r raciborskii blooms these results supported our second hypothesis ii that hydrodynamic conditions modulated the role of fe on the dynamics of r raciborskii 5 conclusion the results of a study carried out both in the field and in the lab showed that r raciborskii a worldwide distributed and bloom forming diazotrophic cyanobacterium has higher requirements for bioavailable fe than non nitrogen fixing algae especially under conditions of n deficiency since this microelement is largely involved in the metabolic pathways of nitrogen utilization actually our investigation showed that the absolute dominance of r raciborskii occurred when the habitat turned to conditions characterized by high temperatures water stratification lowering of available nitrogen and an increased bio availability of fe the results achieved strongly suggest that fe bio availability is an important axis in the multidimensional space that defines the local realized niche of this cyanobacterium the range of variability of this axis affected the growth and dominance patterns of r raciborskii in the study reservoir and under appropriate circumstances allowed this species to outcompete other phytoplankton taxa up to forming almost monospecific assemblages the results indicate that dissolved fe availability should be therefore considered as important as that of other macronutrients n p or si for diatom commonly considered as fundamental variables governing the dynamics of phytoplankton and shaping their niches as a consequence fe concentrations in the water column as well as oxygen measurements along the water column should be routinely included in the monitoring programs aimed at predicting and controlling r raciborskii blooms moreover water management addressed at increasing hypolimnetic oxygenation during stratification could contribute to reduce fe bioavailability in reservoirs and limit the occurrence and the extent of r raciborskii blooms data availability statement the data that support the findings of this study are available by the corresponding author upon reasonable request declaration of

15924,polyethylene terephthalate pet is produced worldwide mainly as material for plastic drink bottles pet is produced by polymerization of purified terephthalate pta or dimethyl terephthalate dmt with ethylene glycol during the synthetic manufacturing processes of pta and dmt high organic loading wastewater is produced which is typically treated separately by anaerobic wastewater treatment technologies given the high demand for pet manufacturing plants are expanding globally which will result in an increase in the amounts of pta and dmt wastewater in need of treatment in terms of effective treatment the cotreatment of pta and dmt wastewater has several advantages including lower area and energy requirements in this study we examined the performance of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor in cotreating pta and dmt wastewater with high organic loading evaluating its removal characteristics after 518 days of continuous operation in addition we performed a microbiome analysis of the uasb granular sludge to uncover the microbial interactions and metabolic functions within the reactor by continuous operation we achieved an organic removal rate of 6 6 kg m

based on genomic and enzymatic approaches junghare et al 2019 nobu et al 2015 on the other hand the metabolic functions of p isophthalicum ji and p terephthalicum jt are still limited due to the lack of their genomic sequences in a recent study metatranscriptomics of uasb granules treated with pta wastewater fed with 12 mm bz ta or trimellitate revealed that aromatic compound degrading syntrophs expressed different pathways depending on the substrate and ta degraders may secrete intracellular bz to improve the thermodynamic favorability of ta degradation nobu et al 2017 thus clarifying the role of each substrate in syntrophic metabolisms is important for better understanding of their survival strategies in anaerobic ecosystem that lead to better control of the treatment process although anaerobic oa degradation in denitrifying or sulfate reducing bacteria has been estimated to be degraded to benzoyl coa via orthophthayl coa and then by the benzoyl coa degradation pathway boll et al 2020 syntrophic oa degradation pathways are still unknown furthermore anaerobic microbial degradation of pt and dmt is a complete mystery on site pta and dmt wastewater have been treated separately due to their different synthetic processes however it is possible that pta and dmt may be treated in the same plant considering recent recycling efforts to convert pet waste to feedstock

into the ddbj sequence read archive database dra012838 3 results and discussion 3 1 continuous treatment of synthetic pta dmt manufacturing wastewater during the entire operational period the ph values in the influent and effluent were 7 0 0 4 and 7 3 0 2 respectively fig s2h in the start up period phase 1 while a 43 7 4 total cod removal efficiency was observed during days 7 19 total and soluble cod removal efficiencies during days 71 81 reached 90 2 8 and 94 3 1 0 fig s2a and s2b indicating that the seed sludges were acclimated to pta dmt wastewater degradation the total and soluble cod removal efficiencies in phase 1 were 71 19 and 89 6 1 respectively table 1 during phases 1 8 the organic loading rate olr was elevated from 1 8 0 2 kg m 3 day 1 to 7 6 0 7 kg m 3 day 1 and increased with substrate concentration tables 1 s1 and s2 dmt and fm were added into the influent wastewater in the phases 3 and 4 respectively which are present in the dmt manufacturing wastewater and the concentrations were fixed according to known discharged level after the phase 4 shah et al 1998 yasin et al 2020 tables s1 and s2 the total and soluble cod removal efficiencies during phases 3 7 were 90 indicating that the uasb reactor allows an olr of 6 0 0 5 kg m 3 day 1 the produced biogas was composed of 72 8 3 5 ch4 24 2 3 4 co2 and 3 1 1 2 n2 gasses following the starting up period phases 2 8 based on the linear relationship r2 0 973 between methane production rates and cod removal efficiencies the methane conversion rate was 84 in the uasb reactor fig s3 which is comparable with previous study in the two stage uasb system treating synthetic pta wastewater containing ac bz and ta as 80 of the methane conversion rate calculated from methane production rates and olr olr of 25 kg m 3 day 1 and 90 of cod removal efficiency kleerebezem et al 2005 during the entire operational day no h2 gas was detected indicating that vfa accumulation in the uasb reactor e g propionate did not occur in this study which frequently occurs with high olr operation kuroda et al 2015 at an olr of 7 6 0 7 kg m 3 day 1 the total and soluble cod removal efficiencies significantly dropped to 87 table 1 aromatic compounds and organic acids in the influent wastewater were mostly removed by the uasb reactor during phases 2 7 removal efficiency as cod concentration 76 100 fig 2 but high concentrations of pt 1180 mg cod l 1 22 of removal efficiency ta 467 mg cod l 1 70 ia 315 mg cod l 1 65 and oa 160 mg cod l 1 81 remained in the effluent at phase 8 to date high concentrations of bz and ac have caused inhibitory effects on ta and pt degradation kleerebezem et al 1999 ma et al 2020 besides pt is among the organic compounds in pta wastewater most resistant to biodegradation ma et al 2020 furthermore the biodegradability of phthalates in the natural environment is oa ta ia liang et al 2008 in phase 8 the order of removal efficiencies of aromatic compounds was bz oa ta ia pt fig 1 which is consistent with previous studies as discussed above based on those removal efficiencies pt degradation might be competed with bz degradation in the uasb reactor due to the lowest biodegradability in phase 8 with highest bz concentration fig 1 table 1 and table s1 therefore this study indicates that pt and its inhibitor treatment is the most critical step in the successful treatment of pta dmt wastewater under methanogenic conditions in this study the organic removal rates in the uasb reactor were 5 6 kg m 3 day 1 in phase 7 and 6 6 kg m 3 day 1 in phase 8 table 1 previously reported organic removal rates of a single anaerobic reactor treating pta wastewater except for hybrid process process treating wastewater containing only ta and no confirmation of ta degradation in the process were 1 5 5 5 kg m 3 day 1 joung et al 2009 kleerebezem et al 2005 macarie 2000 therefore the uasb reactor in this study demonstrates the highest organic removal rate the reason for this may be the influence of mt and fm derived from dmt wastewater the increase of mt concentration and addition of fm may activate mt utilizing and or hydrogenotrophic methanogens respectively in the uasb granular sludge discussed in detail in section 3 2 in order to reduce the ta pt degradation inhibition by bz and ac at high concentrations two stage treatment processes have been studied for pta wastewater treatment until now the organic removal rates of two stage uasb reactors and upflow anaerobic fluidized bed sequencing batch reactor uafb sbr systems have been reported to be 22 5 kg m 3 day 1 and 9 10 kg m 3 day 1 respectively kleerebezem et al 2005 ma et al 2020b to enhance organic removal rates of over 6 6 kg m 3 day 1 at phase 8 an additional treatment process is required for inhibitor removal in addition the pta dmt wastewater in this study did not contain low concentrations of aromatic compounds e g trimellitic acid and 4 carboxybenzaldehyde garg and prasad 2017 or formaldehyde from the dmt wastewater shah et al 1998 therefore the biodegradability of these materials should be confirmed through reactor and batch culture based experiments such as continuous treatment and methane activity tests overall this study indicates that cotreatment of pta and dmt manufacturing wastewater is feasible and may remove organic matter at higher olrs than pta wastewater alone to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on cotreatment of complex wastewater from pta and dmt manufacturing processes using the uasb reactor 3 2 microbial community shifts corresponding to changes in reactor operational conditions this study observed 28 979 83 273 nonchimeric sequence reads and 115 373 otus 97 similarities from 16 granular sludge samples in the uasb reactor unweighted weighted unifrac based pcoa showed that microbial community structures were significantly changed by the addition of fm phases 4 and 5 to the wastewater figs 2 and s4 and tables s1 and s2 among the predominant otus methanogenic archaea were methanobacterium pta00009 methanolinea pta00015 and methanoregula pta00026 of the hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanothrix pta00001 and pta00011 of aceticlastic methanogen and mt utilizing methanomethylovorans pta00061 and methanomassiliicoccus pta00047 the predominant putative aromatic compound degraders were syntrophus pta00006 syntrophorhabdus pta00007 and pta00004 and pelotomaculum pta00012 fig 2 the sludge microbiomes of methanogens and syntrophs are similar to previous studies kuroda et al 2016 narihiro et al 2018 indicating that these are core microbiomes for treating pta wastewater in uasb reactors through the entire periods mt utilizing methanogen methanomassiliicoccus pta00047 was stably present in the uasb reactor fig 2 methanomassiliicoccus can employ hydrogen in addition to mt for methanogenesis and can consume hydrogen to partial pressures 0 1 pa which is one order of magnitude lower than the known hydrogen utilizing methanogens that commonly observed in anaerobic wastewater treatment process e g methanobacterium and methanospirillum feldewert et al 2021 furthermore a positive correlation between methanomassiliicoccus and syntrophorhabdus has been found from microbial community profiling of pta treating uasb reactors kuroda et al 2016 therefore we hypothesized that methanomassiliicoccus may be stably present in the uasb granular sludge due to the increased mt concentration derived from dmt wastewater and may be responsible for the syntrophic relationship under low hydrogen partial pressure which can avoid competition with other hydrogenotrophic methanogens in addition when the addition of fm was initiated methanoregula pta00026 newly acquired a niche and the relative abundances of syntrophus pta00006 and syntrophorhabdus pta00007 and pta00004 were increased during phase 4 5 fig 2 methanoregula is often minor population in full scale uasb reactors treating pta wastewater kuroda et al 2016 narihiro et al 2018 but 16s rrna gene based correlation analysis showed that methanoregula forms positive correlation with candidatus methanofastidiosum and several uncultivated microorganisms that may play roles for vfas degradation narihiro et al 2018 in this study the abundance of syntrophus and syntrophorhabdus were increased with the addition of fm which may contribute to the treatment of pta dmt wastewater through stimulating syntrophic interactions on the other hand the abundance of several uncultured taxa such as tpd 58 fcpu426 ca magasanikbacteria and ta06 were increased from phase 4 fig 2 although their roles in the uasb reactor are unknown the fm might be one of the keys for predominance of those functionally known organisms based on spearman s rank correlation test p 0 05 only positive correlation we found specific syntrophic partnerships in the sludge microbiome fig s5 syntrophobacter pta00039 a known propionate degrading syntroph positively correlated with methanobacterium pta00009 and pta00032 and methanomassiliicoccus pta00047 in addition putative aromatic compound degraders syntrophorhabdus pta00007 and methanolinea pta00015 were significantly correlated p 0 05 direct or indirect positive relationships between syntrophorhabdus and methanolinea have been reported in an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor treating phenol and a uasb reactor treating pta wastewater franchi et al 2020 narihiro et al 2018 suggesting that such close syntrophic relationships are often formed in uasb granular sludge treatment of aromatic compound containing wastewater furthermore phylogenetically unique archaea of putative symbiotic organisms so called dpann archaea belonging to the order woesearchaeales pta00072 had positive correlations with methanoregula pta00026 ca methanofastidiosum pta00043 and methanosarcina pta00058 fig s5 a recent global 16s rrna gene survey e g freshwater soil marine water and hydrothermal vent water suggests that some members of woesearchaeales establish symbiotic or parasitic relationships with methanogens liu et al 2018 we detected woesearchaeales otus at a relatively high abundance rate of 16s rrna gene sequences from several uasb reactors treating pta wastewater kuroda et al 2016 narihiro et al 2018 indicating that woesearchaeales are widely distributed in the environment although the results are based on 16s rrna based analysis this is the first report that woesearchaeales organisms may have a parasitic or symbiotic lifestyle with methanogens in a pta dmt wastewater treatment ecosystem further analysis using metagenome derived genome information will be needed to clarify the ecophysiology of woesearchaeales organisms 3 3 elucidation of syntrophic

syntrophs have most of the genes for bz degradation pelotomaculaceae pta 1498 has no benzoate transporter related genes suggesting that pelotomaculaceae does not secrete bz as a byproduct of ta degradation some uncultured syntrophaceae organisms are known as bz degraders in uasb treatment of pta wastewater nobu et al 2017 however there were very few or no bz degradation genes in the syntrophus pta bin 35 and syntrophales pta bin 76 sub and pta 1547 genomes retrieved in short for our pta dmt wastewater treating uasb reactor pelotomaculaceae pta 1498 was responsible for ta

for methanogens most bins have essential gene clusters of tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase mtr methyl coenzyme m reductase mcr formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase fmd and heterodisulfide

2014 we further attempted to find the oa degrading pathways in the uasb reactor based on amino acid sequence similarity to previously assumed genes involved in oa degradation table s7 through manual curation of oa degrading gene clusters we found that syntrophorhabdaceae pta bin 92 and syntrophorhabdus pta bin 58 sub have gene clusters containing oa transporter related genes associated with the

58 sub 01829 and ipda pta bin 58 sub 01830 in addition to oa transporter related genes fig 4a and table s7 it is assumed that anaerobic oa degradation starts from conversion into phthaloyl coa via heterodimeric sptab subunits of succinyl coa phthalate coa transferase 3a denitrifying bacteria or phthalate coa ligase 3b sulfate reducing bacteria fig 4a boll et al 2020 then further degradation is catalyzed by phthaloyl coa decarboxylase 4 with the 5 dodecameric ubix like subunit of prfmn forming prenyltransferase and 6 nudix like hydrolase putatively involved in the synthesis of dimethylallyl phosphate dmap from dimethylallyl diphosphate dmapp in addition anaerobic ta or ia degradation gene sets have been encoded as a single cluster that contains ta or ia transporters and transcriptional regulators junghare et al 2019 nobu et al 2017 2015 to estimate the putative function of two ubid family proteins pta bin 92 01643 and pta bin 92 01644 we constructed a phylogenetic tree of ubid related proteins involved in aromatic compound decarboxylation fig 5 two ubid family proteins are distantly related to known isophthalyl coa terephthalyl coa and orthophthalyl coa decarboxylases and clustered with functionally unknown proteins opy75633 1 ae63 00274 opy65918 1 a4e63 02778 and opy74358 1 a4e64 observed in the uasb reactor treatment of pta wastewater nobu et al 2017 these phylogenetic observations and gene cluster comparison with known oa degraders suggest that two novel ubid family proteins of syntrophorhabdaceae organisms may have a potential role in orthophthalyl coa decarboxylation and have independently evolved in functionally different linages such as sulfate reducers e g desulfobacula and desulfosarcina and denitrifers e g atomatoleum and azoarcus fig 5 in short we propose two possible routes for anaerobic oa degradation in the reactors fig 4b the first is that syntrophorhabdaceae pta bin 92 directly decarboxylates oa and ligases coa into the bz although the direct decarboxylation of oa is thermodynamically difficult due to the formation of a nonstabilized dianionic transition state ebenau jehle et al 2017 ta degradation of syntrophorhabdus aromaticivorans ui and pelotomaculum related organisms may occur lykidis et al 2011 nobu et al 2015 wu et al 2013 as indicated by the physiological traits of aerobes taylor and ribbons 1983 second the ia degradation catalyzing enzymes ipdacy of syntrophorhabdus pta bin 58 sub activate oa to orthophthalyl coa which is followed by decarboxylation i e ia is activated by coa ligase ipdy and then converted to benzoyl coa by decarboxylation related enzymes ipdac junghare et al 2019 nobu et al 2017 2015 the amino acid sequence homology between ipdy of syntrophorhabdus pta bin 58 sub 01830 and s aromaticivorans ui synardraft 0373 show high similarity 92 table s7 however a previous study reported that no coa ligase activity was observed in oa by in vitro enzyme assays with a cell free extract from syntrophorhabdus aromaticivorans ui junghare et al 2019 notably the ia degradation gene clusters of syntrophorhabdus aromaticivorans ui synardraft 0372 0378 lack trap transporters and periplasmic binding proteins that are found in known oa degrading bacteria fig 4a tables s5 and s7 junghare et al 2019 nobu et al 2017 2015 suggesting that the trap transporter subunit may be essential to the incorporation of oa inside the cells in addition both genomes of the candidate oa degraders syntrophorhabdaceae pta bin 92 and syntrophorhabdus pta bin 58 sub encode nudix like hydrolase that can catalyze the synthesis of dmap from dmapp and showed 22 60 homology with a gene set 1 5 of d cetonica jcm12296 fig 4a suggesting that oa may be degraded by the same route of d cetonica jcm12296 via a putative atp dependent coa ligase 3b fig 4a and 4b boll et al 2020 geiger et al 2019 to test these assumptions additional studies employing transcriptome and in vitro enzyme assays are needed overall shotgun metagenomic analysis revealed that there are clear differences among five lineages of syntrophic bacteria with respect to their roles in degrading major aromatic compounds in synthetic pta wastewater i e pelotomaculaceae pta 1498 for ta syntrophorhabdaceae pta bin 92 and syntrophorhabdus pta bin 58 sub for ia oa and syntrophorhabdus pta bin 58 sub and pta bin 63 and syntrophorhabdaceae pta bin 92 and pta40 005 sub for bz fig s7 it is assumed that these syntrophic bacteria and likely other bacterial populations may be responsible for the degradation of pt and dmt however we were unable to assign the functional genes involved in the degradation of these compounds from our metagenomic dataset due to limited enzymatic and biochemical information on pt dmt degradation under methanogenic conditions further study is therefore needed to elucidate the pta dmt degradation mechanisms and to fully understand anaerobic pta dmt wastewater treatment processes conclusion this study demonstrates the performance of a uasb reactor in treating high organic loading pta dmt wastewater specifically its removal characteristics after 518 days of continuous operation in addition we performed a microbiome analysis of uasb granular sludge to elucidate the microbial interactions and metabolic functions of the reactor the conclusions of this study are as follows during the cotreatment of pta dmt wastewater the uasb reactor achieved an organic removal rate of 6 6 kg m 3 day 1 during phase 8 cod in the effluent during phase 8 was mainly composed of pt ta ia and oa which may be treated by a two stage anaerobic reactor system e g uasb and uafb sbr we found specific microbial interactions between the aromatic compound degrading syntroph syntrophorhabdus and the hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanolinea in addition anaerobic woesearchaeales organisms were positively correlated with hydrogenotrophic methanoregula methylotrophic candidatus methanofastidiosum and aceticlastic methanosarcina methanogens suggesting that woesearchaeales related dpann archaea may have parasitic or symbiotic relationships with methanogens in granular sludge shotgun metagenomic analysis revealed that ta ia oa and bz were degraded by metabolically diverse syntrophic bacteria of the families pelotomaculaceae and syntrophorhabdaceae according to their genomes we proposed two possible routes for oa degradation under methanogenic conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

15924,polyethylene terephthalate pet is produced worldwide mainly as material for plastic drink bottles pet is produced by polymerization of purified terephthalate pta or dimethyl terephthalate dmt with ethylene glycol during the synthetic manufacturing processes of pta and dmt high organic loading wastewater is produced which is typically treated separately by anaerobic wastewater treatment technologies given the high demand for pet manufacturing plants are expanding globally which will result in an increase in the amounts of pta and dmt wastewater in need of treatment in terms of

microbiome analysis of the uasb granular sludge to uncover the microbial interactions and metabolic functions within the reactor by continuous operation we achieved an organic removal rate of 6 6 kg m

based on genomic and enzymatic approaches junghare et al 2019 nobu et al 2015 on the other hand the metabolic functions of p isophthalicum ji and p terephthalicum jt are still limited due to the lack of their genomic sequences in a recent study metatranscriptomics of uasb granules treated with pta wastewater fed with 12 mm bz ta or trimellitate revealed that aromatic compound degrading syntrophs expressed different pathways depending on the substrate and ta degraders may secrete intracellular bz to improve the thermodynamic favorability of ta degradation nobu et al 2017 thus clarifying the role of each substrate in syntrophic metabolisms is important for better understanding of their survival strategies in anaerobic ecosystem that lead to better control of the treatment process although anaerobic oa degradation in denitrifying or sulfate reducing bacteria has been estimated to be degraded to benzoyl coa via orthophthayl coa and then by the benzoyl coa degradation pathway boll et al 2020 syntrophic oa degradation pathways are still unknown furthermore anaerobic microbial degradation of pt and dmt is a complete mystery on site pta and dmt wastewater have been treated separately due to their different synthetic processes however it is possible that pta and dmt may be treated in the same plant considering recent recycling efforts to convert pet waste to feedstock

compact area and low energy requirements cotreatment of pta and dmt wastewater may be advantageous to determine the performance of a uasb reactor for treating high organic loading complex wastewater from pta and dmt manufacturing processes we operated a reactor continuously for 518 days to evaluate its removal capabilities in addition we performed 16s rrna gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomic

values in the influent and effluent were 7 0 0 4 and 7 3 0 2 respectively fig s2h in the start up period phase 1 while a 43 7 4 total cod removal efficiency was observed during days 7 19 total and soluble cod removal efficiencies during days 71 81 reached 90 2 8 and 94 3 1 0 fig s2a and s2b indicating that the seed sludges were acclimated to pta dmt wastewater degradation the total and soluble cod removal efficiencies in phase 1 were 71 19 and 89 6 1 respectively table 1 during phases 1 8 the organic loading rate olr was elevated from 1 8 0 2 kg m 3 day 1 to 7 6 0 7 kg m 3 day 1 and increased with substrate concentration tables 1 s1 and s2 dmt and fm were added into the influent wastewater in the phases 3 and 4 respectively which are present in the dmt manufacturing wastewater and the concentrations were fixed according to known discharged level after the phase 4 shah et al 1998 yasin et al 2020 tables s1 and s2 the total and soluble cod removal efficiencies during phases 3

phases 2 8 based on the linear relationship r2 0 973 between methane production rates and cod removal efficiencies the methane conversion rate was 84 in the uasb reactor fig s3 which is comparable with previous study in the two stage uasb system treating synthetic pta wastewater containing ac bz and ta as 80 of the methane conversion rate calculated from methane production rates and olr olr of 25 kg m 3 day 1 and 90 of cod removal efficiency kleerebezem et al 2005 during the entire operational day no h2 gas was detected indicating that vfa accumulation in the uasb reactor e g propionate did not occur in this study which frequently occurs with high olr operation kuroda et al 2015 at an olr of 7 6 0 7 kg m 3 day 1 the total and soluble cod removal efficiencies significantly dropped to 87 table 1 aromatic compounds and organic acids in the influent wastewater were mostly removed by the uasb reactor during phases 2 7 removal efficiency as cod concentration 76 100 fig 2 but high concentrations of pt 1180 mg cod l 1 22 of removal efficiency ta 467 mg cod l 1 70 ia 315 mg cod l 1 65 and oa 160 mg cod l 1 81 remained in the effluent at phase 8 to date high concentrations of bz and ac have caused inhibitory effects on ta and pt degradation kleerebezem et al 1999 ma et al 2020 besides pt is among the organic compounds in pta wastewater most resistant to biodegradation ma et al 2020 furthermore the biodegradability of phthalates in the natural environment is oa ta ia liang et al 2008 in phase 8 the order of removal efficiencies of aromatic compounds was bz oa ta ia pt fig 1 which is consistent with previous studies as discussed above based on those removal efficiencies pt degradation might be competed with bz degradation in the uasb reactor due to the lowest biodegradability in phase 8 with highest bz concentration fig 1 table 1 and table s1 therefore this study indicates that pt and its inhibitor treatment is the most critical step in the successful treatment of pta dmt wastewater under methanogenic conditions in this study the organic removal rates in the uasb reactor were 5 6 kg m 3 day 1 in phase 7 and 6 6 kg m 3 day 1 in phase 8 table 1 previously reported organic removal rates of a single anaerobic reactor treating pta wastewater except for hybrid process process treating wastewater containing only ta and no confirmation of ta degradation in the process were 1 5 5 5 kg m 3 day 1 joung et al 2009 kleerebezem et al 2005 macarie 2000 therefore the uasb reactor in this study demonstrates the highest organic removal rate the reason for this may be the influence of mt and fm derived from dmt wastewater the increase of mt concentration and addition of fm may activate mt utilizing and or hydrogenotrophic methanogens respectively in the uasb granular sludge discussed in detail in section 3 2 in order to reduce the ta pt degradation inhibition by bz and ac at high concentrations two stage treatment processes have been studied for pta wastewater treatment until now the organic removal rates of two stage uasb reactors and upflow anaerobic fluidized bed sequencing batch reactor uafb sbr systems have been reported to be 22 5 kg m 3 day 1 and 9 10 kg m 3 day 1 respectively kleerebezem et al 2005 ma et al 2020b to enhance organic removal rates of over 6 6 kg m 3 day 1 at phase 8 an additional treatment process is required for inhibitor removal in addition the pta dmt wastewater in this study did not contain low concentrations of aromatic compounds e g trimellitic acid and 4 carboxybenzaldehyde garg and prasad 2017 or formaldehyde from the dmt wastewater shah et al 1998 therefore the biodegradability of these materials should be confirmed through reactor and batch culture based experiments such as continuous treatment and methane activity tests overall this study indicates that cotreatment of pta and dmt manufacturing wastewater is feasible and may remove organic matter at higher olrs than pta wastewater alone to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on cotreatment of complex wastewater from pta and dmt manufacturing processes using the uasb reactor 3 2 microbial community shifts corresponding to changes in reactor operational conditions this study observed 28 979 83 273 nonchimeric sequence reads and 115 373 otus 97 similarities from 16 granular sludge samples in the uasb reactor unweighted weighted unifrac based pcoa showed that microbial community structures were significantly changed by the addition of fm phases 4 and 5 to the wastewater figs 2 and s4 and tables s1 and s2 among the predominant otus methanogenic archaea were methanobacterium pta00009 methanolinea pta00015 and methanoregula pta00026 of the hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanothrix pta00001 and pta00011 of aceticlastic methanogen and mt utilizing methanomethylovorans pta00061 and methanomassiliicoccus pta00047 the predominant putative aromatic compound degraders were syntrophus pta00006 syntrophorhabdus pta00007 and pta00004 and pelotomaculum pta00012 fig 2 the sludge microbiomes of methanogens and syntrophs are similar to previous studies kuroda et al 2016 narihiro et al 2018 indicating that these are core microbiomes for treating pta wastewater in uasb reactors through the entire periods mt utilizing methanogen methanomassiliicoccus pta00047 was stably present in the uasb reactor fig 2 methanomassiliicoccus can employ hydrogen in addition to mt for methanogenesis and can consume hydrogen to partial pressures 0 1 pa which is one order of magnitude lower than the known hydrogen utilizing methanogens that commonly observed in anaerobic wastewater treatment process e g methanobacterium and methanospirillum feldewert et al 2021 furthermore a positive correlation between methanomassiliicoccus and syntrophorhabdus has been found from microbial community profiling of pta treating uasb reactors kuroda et al 2016 therefore we hypothesized that methanomassiliicoccus may be stably present in the uasb granular sludge due to the increased mt concentration derived from dmt wastewater and may be responsible for the syntrophic relationship under low hydrogen partial pressure which can avoid competition with other hydrogenotrophic methanogens in addition when the addition of fm was initiated methanoregula pta00026 newly acquired a niche and the relative abundances of syntrophus pta00006 and syntrophorhabdus pta00007 and pta00004 were increased during phase 4 5 fig 2 methanoregula is often minor population in full scale uasb reactors treating pta wastewater kuroda et al 2016 narihiro et al 2018 but 16s rrna gene based correlation analysis showed that methanoregula forms positive correlation with candidatus methanofastidiosum and several uncultivated microorganisms that may play roles for vfas degradation narihiro et al 2018 in this study the abundance of syntrophus and syntrophorhabdus were increased with the addition of fm which may contribute to the treatment of pta dmt wastewater through stimulating syntrophic interactions on the other hand the abundance of several uncultured taxa such as tpd 58 fcpu426 ca magasanikbacteria and ta06 were increased from phase 4 fig 2 although their roles in the uasb reactor are unknown the fm might be one of the keys for predominance of those functionally known organisms based on spearman s rank correlation test p 0 05 only positive correlation we found specific syntrophic partnerships in the sludge microbiome fig s5 syntrophobacter pta00039 a known propionate degrading syntroph positively correlated with methanobacterium pta00009 and pta00032 and methanomassiliicoccus pta00047 in addition putative aromatic compound degraders syntrophorhabdus pta00007 and methanolinea pta00015 were significantly correlated p 0 05 direct or indirect positive relationships between syntrophorhabdus and methanolinea have been reported in an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor treating phenol and a uasb reactor treating pta wastewater franchi et al 2020 narihiro et al 2018 suggesting that such close syntrophic relationships are often formed in uasb granular sludge treatment of aromatic compound containing wastewater furthermore phylogenetically unique archaea of putative symbiotic organisms so called dpann archaea belonging to the order woesearchaeales pta00072 had positive correlations with methanoregula pta00026 ca methanofastidiosum pta00043 and methanosarcina pta00058 fig s5 a recent global 16s rrna gene survey e g freshwater soil marine water and hydrothermal vent water suggests that some members of woesearchaeales establish symbiotic or parasitic relationships with methanogens liu et al 2018 we detected woesearchaeales otus at a relatively high abundance rate of 16s rrna gene sequences from several uasb reactors treating pta wastewater kuroda et al 2016 narihiro et al 2018 indicating that woesearchaeales are widely distributed in the environment although the results are based on 16s rrna based analysis this is the first report that woesearchaeales organisms may have a parasitic or symbiotic lifestyle with methanogens in a pta dmt wastewater treatment ecosystem further analysis using metagenome derived genome information will be needed to clarify the ecophysiology of woesearchaeales organisms 3 3 elucidation of syntrophic aromatic compound degradation metabolism as a result of metagenomic shotgun sequence analysis of granular sludge at phase 8 day 517 we obtained 61 high quality 70 completeness and 8 1 contamination assembled bins fig s6 and table s4 for aromatic compound degrading syntrophs we successfully recovered pelotomaculaceae pta 1498 syntrophorhabdus pta bin 58 sub and pta bin 63 and syntrophorhabdaceae pta bin 92 and pta40 005 sub for the methanogenic archaea we obtained methanoregulaceae pta bin 109 methanolinea pta 2021 sub pta bin 108 and pta40 052 methanoregulaceae pta bin 91 methanomethylovorans pta 1831 methanotrichaceae cluster 18 and pta40 033 methanothrix a cluster 122 methanothrix pta40 030 sub methanobacterium a pta40 037 sub methanobacterium pta bin 89 and methanomassiliicoccus pta bin 119 the abundance of the metagenomic bins was similar to the results of 16s rrna gene analysis fig 1 and table s4 indicating that the reconstruction of the predominant microbial genomes was successfully performed from shotgun dna sequences we annotated genes responsible for syntrophic aromatic compound degradation pathways bz ta ia and oa in five genomes of pelotomaculaceae pta 1498 syntrophorhabdus pta bin 58 sub and pta bin 63 and syntrophorhabdaceae pta bin 92 and pta40 005 sub fig 3 a a complete gene set of ta degradation was present only in pelotomaculaceae pta 1498 02776 02781 and pta 1498 02840 pta 1498 02961 02964 table s5 for ia degradation syntrophorhabdus pta bin 58 sub and syntrophorhabdaceae pta bin 92 have isophthalate coa ligase ipdy isophthalyl coa decarboxylase ipda isophthalyl coa decarboxylase partner protein c ipdc and transcriptional regulators pta bin 58 sub 01828 01831 and pta bin 92 01762 01765 although five syntrophs have most of the genes for bz degradation pelotomaculaceae pta 1498 has no benzoate transporter related genes suggesting that pelotomaculaceae does not secrete bz as a byproduct of ta degradation some uncultured syntrophaceae organisms are known as bz degraders in uasb treatment of pta wastewater nobu et al 2017 however there were very few or no bz degradation genes in the syntrophus pta bin 35 and syntrophales pta bin 76 sub and pta 1547 genomes retrieved in short for our pta dmt wastewater treating uasb reactor pelotomaculaceae pta 1498 was responsible for ta syntrophorhabdus pta bin 58 sub and syntrophorhabdaceae pta bin 92 were responsible for ia and four syntrophs pta bin58 sub pta bin 63 pta bin 92 and pta40 005 sub were responsible for bz degradation for methanogens most bins have essential gene clusters of tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase mtr methyl coenzyme m reductase mcr formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase fmd and heterodisulfide reductase hdr fig 3b and table s6 in addition hydrogenotrophic methanogens pta bin 109 pta 2021 sub pta bin 108 pta40 052 pta bin 91 pta40 037 sub and pta bin 89 and mt utilizing methanogens pta 1831 and pta bin 119 have gene sets of hydrogenase related genes and mtaabc respectively thus this study confirms that these methanogenic bins may produce methane as previously reported costa and leigh 2014 we further attempted to find the oa degrading pathways in the uasb reactor based on amino acid sequence similarity to previously assumed genes involved in oa degradation table s7 through manual curation of oa degrading gene clusters we found that syntrophorhabdaceae pta bin 92 and syntrophorhabdus pta bin 58 sub have gene clusters containing oa transporter related genes associated with the trap transporter family pta bin 92 01641 and pta bin 58 sub 01825 34 and 36 amino acid sequence identities for jcm12296 rs19380 of d cetonica jcm12296 respectively and periplasmic binding protein pta bin 92 01642 27 identity for pa01 00214 of azoarcus sp pa01 pta bin 58 sub 01826 25 identity for jcm12296 rs19385 of d cetonica jcm12296 1 and 2 in fig 4 a table s7 syntrophorhabdaceae pta bin 92 encodes benzoate coa ligase pta bin 92 01639 34 identity for benzoate coa ligase in synardraft 1026 of s aromaticivorans ui dodecameric ubix like subunit of prenylated flavin mononucleotide prfmn forming prenyltransferase related protein pta bin 92 01640 60 identity for jcm12296 rs19370 of d cetonica jcm12296 and two ubid family proteins pta bin 92 01643 and pta bin 92 01644 32 and 33 identities for eb rs21745 of a aromaticum ebn1 nudix like hydrolase pta bin 92 03541 40 identity for eb rs21780 of a aromaticum ebn1 and dodecameric ubix like subunit of prfmn forming prenyltransferase related protein pta bin 92 03542 57 identity for jcm12296 rs19370 of d cetonica jcm12296 were found in different contigs with the gene cluster syntrophorhabdus pta bin 58 sub encodes the dodecameric ubix like subunit of prfmn forming prenyltransferase related protein pta bin 58 sub 01824 63 identity for jcm12296 rs19370 of d cetonica jcm12296 ipdy pta bin 58 sub 01828 ipdc pta bin 58 sub 01829 and ipda pta bin 58 sub 01830 in addition to oa transporter related genes fig 4a and table s7 it is assumed that anaerobic oa degradation starts from conversion into phthaloyl coa via heterodimeric sptab subunits of succinyl coa phthalate coa transferase 3a denitrifying bacteria or phthalate coa ligase 3b sulfate reducing bacteria fig 4a boll et al 2020 then further degradation is catalyzed by phthaloyl coa decarboxylase 4 with the 5 dodecameric ubix like subunit of prfmn forming prenyltransferase and 6 nudix like hydrolase putatively involved in the synthesis of dimethylallyl phosphate dmap from dimethylallyl diphosphate dmapp in addition anaerobic ta or ia degradation gene sets have been encoded as a single cluster that contains ta or ia transporters and transcriptional regulators junghare et al 2019 nobu et al 2017 2015 to estimate the putative function of two ubid family proteins pta bin 92 01643 and pta bin 92 01644 we constructed a phylogenetic tree of ubid related proteins involved in aromatic compound decarboxylation fig 5 two ubid family proteins are distantly related to known isophthalyl coa terephthalyl coa and orthophthalyl coa decarboxylases and clustered with functionally unknown proteins opy75633 1 ae63 00274 opy65918 1 a4e63 02778 and opy74358 1 a4e64 observed in the uasb reactor treatment of pta wastewater nobu et al 2017 these phylogenetic observations and gene cluster comparison with known oa degraders suggest that two novel ubid family proteins of syntrophorhabdaceae organisms may have a potential role in orthophthalyl coa decarboxylation and have independently evolved in functionally different linages such as sulfate reducers e g desulfobacula and desulfosarcina and denitrifers e g atomatoleum and azoarcus fig 5 in short we propose two possible routes for anaerobic oa degradation in the reactors fig 4b the first is that syntrophorhabdaceae pta bin 92 directly decarboxylates oa and ligases coa into the bz although the direct decarboxylation of oa is thermodynamically difficult due to the formation of a nonstabilized dianionic transition state ebenau jehle et al 2017 ta degradation of syntrophorhabdus aromaticivorans ui and pelotomaculum related organisms may occur lykidis et al 2011 nobu et al 2015 wu et al 2013 as indicated by the physiological traits of aerobes taylor and ribbons 1983 second the ia degradation catalyzing enzymes ipdacy of syntrophorhabdus pta bin 58 sub activate oa to orthophthalyl coa which is followed by decarboxylation i e ia is activated by coa ligase ipdy and then converted to benzoyl coa by decarboxylation related enzymes ipdac junghare et al 2019 nobu et al 2017 2015 the amino acid sequence homology between ipdy of syntrophorhabdus pta bin 58 sub 01830 and s aromaticivorans ui synardraft 0373 show high similarity 92 table s7 however a previous study reported that no coa ligase activity was observed in oa by in vitro enzyme assays with a cell free extract from syntrophorhabdus aromaticivorans ui junghare et al 2019 notably the ia degradation gene clusters of syntrophorhabdus aromaticivorans ui synardraft 0372 0378 lack trap transporters and periplasmic binding proteins that are found in known oa degrading bacteria fig 4a tables s5 and s7 junghare et al 2019 nobu et al 2017 2015 suggesting that the trap transporter subunit may be essential to the incorporation of oa inside the cells in addition both genomes of the candidate oa degraders syntrophorhabdaceae pta bin 92 and syntrophorhabdus pta bin 58 sub encode nudix like hydrolase that can catalyze the synthesis of dmap from dmapp and showed 22 60 homology with a gene set 1 5 of d cetonica jcm12296 fig 4a suggesting that oa may be degraded by the same route of d cetonica jcm12296 via a putative atp dependent coa ligase 3b fig 4a and 4b boll et al 2020 geiger et al 2019 to test these assumptions additional studies employing transcriptome and in vitro enzyme assays are needed overall shotgun metagenomic analysis revealed that there are clear differences among five lineages of syntrophic bacteria with respect to their roles in degrading major aromatic compounds in synthetic pta wastewater i e pelotomaculaceae pta 1498 for ta syntrophorhabdaceae pta bin 92 and syntrophorhabdus pta bin 58 sub for ia oa and syntrophorhabdus pta bin 58 sub and pta bin 63 and syntrophorhabdaceae pta bin 92 and pta40 005 sub for bz fig s7 it is assumed that these syntrophic bacteria and likely other bacterial populations may be responsible for the degradation of pt and dmt however we were unable to assign the functional genes involved in the degradation of these compounds from our metagenomic dataset due to limited enzymatic and biochemical information on pt dmt degradation under methanogenic conditions further study is therefore needed to elucidate the pta dmt degradation mechanisms and to fully understand anaerobic pta dmt wastewater treatment processes conclusion this study demonstrates the performance of a uasb reactor in treating high organic loading pta dmt wastewater specifically its removal characteristics after 518 days of continuous operation in addition we performed a microbiome analysis of uasb granular sludge to elucidate the microbial interactions and metabolic functions of the reactor the conclusions of this study are as follows during the cotreatment of pta dmt wastewater the uasb reactor achieved an organic removal rate of 6 6 kg m 3 day 1 during phase 8 cod in the effluent during phase 8 was mainly composed of pt ta ia and oa which may be treated by a two stage anaerobic reactor system e g uasb and uafb sbr we found specific microbial interactions between the aromatic compound degrading syntroph syntrophorhabdus and the hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanolinea in addition anaerobic woesearchaeales organisms were positively correlated with hydrogenotrophic methanoregula methylotrophic candidatus methanofastidiosum and aceticlastic methanosarcina methanogens suggesting that woesearchaeales related dpann archaea may have parasitic or symbiotic relationships with methanogens in granular sludge shotgun metagenomic analysis revealed that ta ia oa and bz were degraded by metabolically diverse syntrophic bacteria of the families pelotomaculaceae and syntrophorhabdaceae according to their genomes we proposed two possible routes for oa degradation under methanogenic conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships
