2875,a novel framework that integrally uses groundwater and streamflow observations to calibrate a physically based sub surface model to generate base flow on a daily time step is presented in this study trend analysis on mean annual base flow time series showed that a declining trend was present in the basin though the upstream humid region was devoid of any trend glue analysis was adopted to the simulation of base flow in the humid region and the most sensitive parameters were identified as the recharge factor rf and discharge factor pd the model was able to satisfactorily simulate base flow as observed values fell within the 95ci bands for the calibration period the mean annual bfi values were computed at muthankera to be 0 236 0 02 the mean seasonal bfi varied from 48 during post monsoon periods to 21 during monsoon periods the base flow simulated by the model was comparable to the output from the eckhardt filter which has been widely cited to be a suitable baseflow separation method for many river basins due to the absence of groundwater level data in the transition region a combination of model and digital filter was used to calibrate that region the draft from the groundwater storage computed from the model was found to be highly nonlinear the rf was seen to be lower and pd to be higher in the transition region than in the humid region this would imply that in the transition region the base flow is generated more gradually in comparison to the humid region this was characteristic of forested basins where the uptake of water by deep rooted trees during evapotranspiration from the unsaturated zone causes delay in the water table response which in turn could result in delay in the base flow generation process the consequence of the calibration exercise on kabini basin was establishing that the heterogeneity in terms of precipitation and land use has resulted in the distinct hydrologic responses from the two regions in the basin keywords

introduction base flow is the streamflow component that comes from groundwater storage during prolonged dry periods and hence can be considered as representative of the catchment physiographic characteristics hall 1968 wittenberg and sivapalan 1999 hydrograph separation of base flow has remained a relevant research area for long because of the insights they provide into the catchment hydrology for example high base flow indices and large recession constants imply a perennial river with large contribution from sub surface stores reilly and kroll 2003 smakhtin 2001 vogel and kroll 1996 in basins with long intervals between precipitation events the river flow is sustained by base flow thus is vital for aquatic habitats choi et al 2018 fan et al 2013 hayes et al 2018 studies have shown that climate variability and land use changes attribute to changes in base flow and that base flow feedback to global warming has been extreme ahiablame et al 2017 ficklin et al 2016 zhang and schilling 2006 accurate quantification and modelling of base flow is thus imperative considering the wide gap that is being projected between water supply and demand miller et al 2016 hydrologic modelling studies mostly focus on how best the peak flow is modelled and the realistic simulation of base flow is often overlooked lo et al 2008 uncertainty in base flow modelling is high because of the difficulty in measuring base flow in the field partington et al 2012 recursive digital filters are the most widely used methods for estimating base flow from streamflow hydrographs they work based on filtering out high frequency signals like that of quick flow from low frequency signals similar to that of base flow lyne and hollick 1979 nathan and mcmahon 1990 though perfect for long term base flow estimation these methods have been criticised for lacking a physical basis chapman 1991 though default filter parameter values have been suggested for the many widely used filters various studies have brought out the need to calibrate the parameters specific to the region of application eckhardt 2005 lim et al 2010 tracer based methods have been used in various studies to calibrate the filters kouanda et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 they have been reported to be labour intensive and that the presence of large uncertainties in the results increases with the time period of the study gonzales et al 2009 lott and stewart 2016 studies have demonstrated how base flow can be separated by using groundwater levels and based on relationship between groundwater table and stream discharge the need for groundwater level measurements with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution may particularly limit its use holko et al 2002 peters and van lanen 2005 studies on base flow simulation using physically based models say conceptual models hydrologic models and groundwater models are not extensive in literature the merit of this approach is that the physical basis of the models gives the base flow outputs from them more plausibility additionally future forecasting studies can be carried out using the models given the forecasted climatological inputs conceptual modelling of base flow basically consists of one or several conceptual reservoirs and a linear or nonlinear storage outflow function it has been indicated that arriving at the right model structure and parameterisation is challenging and that choosing an optimal storage outflow structure for a large number of catchments would be a compromise stoelzle et al 2015 traditionally hydrologic models have incorporated such conceptual models to simulate groundwater discharge luo et al 2012 modified such a conceptual base flow module in the hydrological model swat such that the single reservoir approach was replaced with a two linear reservoir approach and then later in gan and luo 2013 the single linear reservoir was replaced with a non linear reservoir approach karki et al 2021 studied the base flow simulation capability of a similar conceptual module based on an exponential storage discharge function in the national water model fully integrated models have been used to simulate base flow in a synthetic setting which was then used to assess the performance and adequacy of various recursive digital filters for varying rainfall scenarios and catchment characteristics li et al 2013 li et al 2014 partington et al 2012 su et al 2016 this paper puts forward a framework for base flow simulation using a distributed groundwater model the model used in this study ambhasgw is a two dimensional distributed model that is capable of modelling spatially variable recharge and pumping the model essentially solves for the two dimensional ground water equations for an unconfined aquifer it uses an operator split approach wherein the hydraulic head is updated for the vertical flux in each grid then for base flow discharge and finally for lateral flux between the grids scheidegger et al 2021 subash et al 2017 tomer et al 2021 the objectives of this study are to 1 present a new modelling framework to simulate base flow from a subsurface model using both groundwater and streamflow observations for calibration 2 model a temporally varying base flow in a tropical basin by integrating the modelling framework and a recursive digital filter 3 understand the base flow generation and trends in the basin the novel contributions of this study are as follows base flow is simulated at a daily time step using a distributed two dimensional groundwater model from a real basin for a period of 25 years the calibration is done against observed groundwater levels and streamflow data integrally further the performance of four digital filters for various parameterisations are compared against the simulated base flow from the calibrated model the modelling framework is applied to a sub humid tropical river basin characterised by a sharp climatic gradient and trends the kabini basin is highly heterogeneous such that the region up to muthankera basin which is nested in the basin is humid with no temporal variation in base flow and groundwater levels but the region downstream is sub humid heavily forested and it has been reported in earlier studies that streamflow in kabini during the dry weather period indicated a declining trend sekhar et al 2016 to our knowledge there has not been any study where base flow for this region has been modelled 2 methodology 2 1 study area and data the kabini basin is a tributary of the river cauvery and is located on the western ghats india the region up to the kabini dam in the basin has been chosen for the study and will henceforth be referred to as kabini basin in this paper fig 1 the basin lies such that it forms a barrier to the monsoonal winds coming from the indian ocean and moving north east resulting in a steep decline in the annual rainfall as one move eastwards into the basin table 1 the basin can be differentiated into two regions the region upstream extending up to the muthankera gauge muthankera basin falls in a humid zone which receives 1500 2500 mm of average annual rainfall the region between the muthankera gauge and the kabini dam transition zone gets an annual average rainfall of 1000 1500 mm and is a sub humid zone in addition to the precipitation gradient the two regions have distinct land cover the humid zone is dominated by plantation land cover and the sub humid zone comprises predominantly of forest cover the soils of the basin are fine textured comprising of laterites forest loam and riverine alluvium the humid zone has a lateritic cover and thick mature saprolite and the sub humid zone has red and black soil system with thick immature saprolite the basin lies on a gneissic complex with few strips of schist formations hornblende gneiss covers the humid zone and the sub humid zone is underlain by leucocratic gneiss soumya et al 2013 the choice of this basin was motivated by the presence of significant base flow trends the trends of dry weather stream flow in the kabini river over three decades indicated a significant decline sekhar et al 2016 this is characteristic of the large scale groundwater depletion across the indian sub continent mukherjee et al 2018 rodell et al 2009 the hydrology of the basin has been monitored since 1974 by the central water commission cwc at muthankera and at kabini dam by the karnataka water resources department the daily rainfall data was obtained for the period from 1991 to 2016 from seven rain gauging stations in and around the basin the rain gauge stations 1 4 were monitored by the indian meteorological department imd and the ones numbered 5 7 were monitored by karnataka state natural disaster monitoring centre ksndmc depth to groundwater level data was obtained from the central groundwater board india through the india wris portal depth to gwl data was available for four seasons namely pre monsoon monsoon post monsoon kharif post monsoon rabi for the period from 1996 to 2017 2 2 base flow separation using digital filters in order to ascertain the trend base flow was separated using existing digital filtering methods they are briefly mentioned below 2 2 1 lyne hollick filter lyne and hollick 1979 proposed the filter equation 1 q d i a q d i 1 1 a 2 q i q i 1 subject to 2 q d i 0 and 3 q b i q i q d i where q is the total streamflow m3 s q d is the quickflow m3 s q b is the base flow m3 s i is the daily time step and a is the filter parameter this technique was developed on the basis of signal processing that filtering out high frequency signals was intuitively analogous to the separation of low frequency base flow from higher frequencies of quick flow nathan and mcmahon 1990 suggested that the value of filter parameter in the range 0 90 0 95 yielded the most acceptable base flow separation they applied the lyne hollick algorithm to 186 catchments of sizes in the range of 4 2 210 km2 they noted that compared to the existing base flow separation methods at the time this filter reflected the negligible base flow contributions better was less variable and gave closest estimates to that from widely accepted manual separation technique based on the master recession curve 2 2 2 chapman maxwell filter chapman 1991 noted that the lyne hollick algorithm implied that when direct runoff ceased the base flow was constant which was not in accordance with the recession theory he suggested an improved algorithm where the filter parameter now assumed hydrological significance as the recession constant when the quick flow response has ceased 4 q b i 3 k 1 3 k q b i 1 1 k 3 k q i q i 1 subject to 5 q b i q i where k is the filter parameter analogous to the recession constant chapman and maxwell 1996 simplified the equation to 6 q b i k 2 k q b i 1 1 k 2 k q i which provided identical results to the earlier form eckhardt 2005 2 2 3 boughton filter boughton used a base flow separation algorithm in the awbm model he developed in 1993 chapman 1999 the filter equation is as follows 7 q b i k 1 c q b i 1 c 1 c q i subject to eq 5 is a modification to the chapman maxwell algorithm giving it more flexibility by replacing the term 1 k with parameter c 2 2 4 eckhardt filter eckhardt filter is a two parameter recursive filter which is mathematically expressed as 8 q b i 1 b f i m a x k q b i 1 1 k b f i m a x q i 1 k b f i m a x subject to eq 5 where k is the recession constant and b f i m a x is the maximum base flow index that can be modelled by the algorithm eckhardt 2005 suggested to set b f i m a x 0 80 for perennial streams with porous aquifers b f i m a x 0 50 for ephemeral streams with porous aquifers and b f i m a x 0 25 for perennial streams with hard rock aquifers the filter parameter k can be determined from recession analysis b f i m a x was found to be the less critical parameter in the filter which was helpful considering it cannot be derived from streamflow records it was stated that an uncertainty of 19 in the b f i m a x leads to a mean error of 5 in the calculation of bfi eckhardt 2012 it was advised that b f i m a x be chosen depending on the hydrogeological conditions of a catchment say by calibration against results from a tracer based separation 2 3 estimation of recession constant the recession constant is one of the filter parameters that need to be calibrated in order to separate base flow from streamflow manual on low flow estimation and prediction has two methods for performing recession analysis in a humid catchment which is constantly interrupted by rainfall events resulting in a series of recession segments the two methods can be classified as those involving construction of a master recession curve mrc and those performing a separate calculation of parameters from individual recession segments irs gustard and demuth 2008 starting point of the recession for individual segments is usually set to the first value below the q 70 threshold at least two days after the peak flood discharge duration of recession in the various segments was uniformly truncated to seven days to reduce variability many samples of varying sizes say 5 10 20 and 30 years were selected from 40 years of streamflow data recession analysis was performed on all the samples to ascertain the uncertainty in the estimated recession constant value incurred from varying the sample size chosen for the analysis 2 4 trend analysis the mann kendall test was used to evaluate temporal trends in base flow in the kabini for the period of 1992 to 2016 mann 1945 presented a non parametric test for randomness against time which is a particular application of kendall s test for correlation kendall 1975 also known as kendal s tau the null hypothesis of randomness ho states that the data x1 x2 xn are a sample of n independent and identically distributed random variables the alternate hypothesis h1 is that the data follow a monotonic trend over time the test statistic is defined as 9 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s g n x j x k where 10 s g n x 1 x 0 0 x 0 1 x 0 kendall 1975 showed that s is asymptotically normally distributed and gave the mean and variance of s for the situation where there may be ties in the x values as 11 e s 0 12 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 j 1 p t j t j 1 2 t j 5 18 where p is the number of tied groups in the data set and t j is the number of data points in the jth tied group a positive value of s indicates that there is an upward trend in which the observations increase with time hipel and mcleod 1994 the temporal variation in base flow from the kabini basin was studied for a period of 25 years from 1992 to 2016 using the mann kendall test trend analysis was performed on time series of mean annual values of base flow the lyne hollick filter and eckhardt filter were used to separate the base flow because ranges of filter parameters for which these filters generated acceptable base flow values in various catchments have been documented in past studies ideally the filters should be calibrated for the region but since such studies have not been done for this basin we used the parameter ranges provided in literature filter parameter values in the range of 0 90 0 95 has been suggested for generating plausible base flow values using the lyne hollick filter the parameter bfi max in eckhardt filter was set as 0 25 since the basin rested on a hard rock aquifer the other filter parameter in the eckhardt filter is the recession constant which was computed from recession analysis the recession analysis was performed using two methods the master recession curve mrc method and the individual recession segments irs method 2 5 modelling framework to simulate base flow 2 5 1 model description ambhasgw is a spatially distributed two dimensional subsurface model that implements transient groundwater modelling horan et al 2021 scheidegger et al 2021 sekhar et al 2018 subash et al 2017 tomer et al 2017 2021 the model solves for the two dimensional groundwater flow equation for an unconfined aquifer it uses an operator split approach wherein first the grids are updated with the net recharge and computes the base flow from each grid and later simulates the horizontal distribution of the flow in grids based on the diffusivity the model requires inputs of initial head and net recharge recharge draft the parameters that need to be calibrated are specific yield sy recharge factor r f discharge factor p d transmissivity t and the hydraulic head corresponding to zero baseflow denoted as hmin the parameters rf pd and hmin can be set as spatially varying in the model the two dimensional equation for a homogeneous isotropic and unconfined aquifer can be written as 13 x h h x y h h y sy k h t q where sy is the specific yield h is the hydraulic head m k is the hydraulic conductivity m day and q is the source sink term x and y are the coordinates m and t is the time days if the drawdown in the aquifer is very small compared to the saturated thickness h can be replaced with an average thickness b assumed to be constant over the aquifer and kb can be replaced by transmissivity t the equation can thus be linearised by this approximation fetter 2007 p 135 the two dimensional transient groundwater flow equation is solved using an operator split approach first the equation is solved vertically for the source sink term q b then it is solved horizontally for the lateral flow tomer et al 2021 the numerical solution for the vertical fluxes is described in subash et al 2017 and is described briefly here sat kumar 2010 improved upon an analytical model developed to predict water table fluctuations based on discrete record of precipitation developed by park and parker 2008 by the addition of a draft term the solution for the recharge abstraction is done independently for each grid the governing equation is given by 14 dh dt λ h sy rf r sy d net sy where h is the groundwater level m t is the time days sy is the specific yield λ is the discharge constant r is the rainfall m rf is the recharge factor and d net is the net groundwater draft m the solution of eq 13 is given in appendix a in subash et al 2017 the solution is given as 15 h t 1 p d h t g u where h t 1 is the head at time step t 1 pd 1 λ s y g p d s y and u r f r d net the above equation implies that baseflow would be generated till the groundwater level reaches 0 which might not be realistic and baseflow might cease at some level hence the equation was modified as 16 h t 1 h m i n p d h t h m i n g u after the hydraulic head has been updated for recharge and abstraction the vertical flux term can be omitted from the linearised form of eq 13 and can be solved for the lateral flow by using a finite difference method 2 5 2 model simulation the spatial domain of the watershed was discretised to 5 km 5 km grids fig 1 the srtm 90 m digital elevation model was used to establish elevation of the land grid the external boundary of the study area was assumed to be a zero flux condition rainfall in each grid was obtained using the thiessen method on the rainfall data at seven stations in and near the basin the parameter values for sy rf pd and t has been kept homogeneous throughout the grids the muthankera basin was chosen for the calibration of the model in this section as the availability of groundwater level data was restricted to the region the draft in the basin was assumed to be zero the basin was discretised to 60 grids the initial head was kept as 6 m below the mean elevation of the grid the value for parameter hmin was set below the lowest elevation among the pixels in each grid and was spatially varying the simulation was done on a daily time step the glue analysis was adopted to the simulation of daily base flow in muthankera basin 2 5 3 parameter estimation using glue the glue method which was proposed by beven and binley 1992 is a monte carlo based approach which uses a large number of model runs with different randomly chosen parameter values selected from a priori probability distribution the likelihood function is calculated for each set of parameters the acceptability of each run is evaluated against observed values on the basis of a subjective threshold the run is considered to be non behavioral if the acceptability falls below the threshold which is defined by a giving an allowable deviation to the highest likelihood value in this study parameter sets with a sample size of 1000 were generated by latin hypercube sampling from a uniform distribution of parameter space the parameter range was varied between 0 005 and 0 12 for specific yield and between 0 01 and 0 30 for recharge factor this was fixed based on estimates of the aquifer parameters for upper cauvery basin through hydrochemistry studies siva soumya 2009 discharge factor was varied between 0 90 and 0 99 and transmissivity was set to vary between 20 and 80 m2 day the output variables considered for calibration were the difference in groundwater levels between the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons gwl grd and streamflow data during recession segments in between the months of january and march q dry the recession segments of streamflow hydrographs for specific years with no precipitation events in the period from dec mar namely 2004 2005 2007 2008 and 2009 were used for calibration in addition to the groundwater level data from 2000 to 2009 the grids which contained at least two observation wells were considered for the calibration the likelihood measure was selected so as to represent the goodness of fit of both the variables combinations of coefficient of determination rsq and rescaled root mean square error rmsesc were taken as the likelihood criterion root mean square error was rescaled by dividing it by the maximum root mean square value in the sample the likelihood functions were set in the following combinations 17 l 1 0 33 r s q q d r y 0 33 r s q g w l g r d 0 33 r m s e s c g w l g r d 18 l 2 0 50 r s q q d r y 0 25 r s q g w l g r d 0 25 r m s e s c g w l g r d 19 l 3 0 25 r s q q d r y 0 5 r s q g w l g r d 0 25 r m s e s c g w l g r d 20 l 4 0 25 r s q q d r y 0 25 r s q g w l g r d 0 50 r m s e s c g w l g r d since values greater than 0 50 is considered acceptable for coefficient of determination with reference to moriasi et al 2007 threshold values for the likelihood functions are set accordingly the subjectivity involved in fixing the threshold value is regarded as a drawback of the glue technique since past studies have emphasized that parameter uncertainty and simulation results are sensitive to the choice of threshold values jin et al 2010 thus fixing the threshold values in accordance with already accepted model evaluation performance ratings facilitates minimizing the subjectivity involved 2 5 4 parameter uncertainty the 95 confidence intervals for base flow due to parameter uncertainty were obtained from the mean monthly values of base flow for the periods used in calibration in this study three indices were used to further compare the derived 95ci a r i l average relative interval length defined by jin et al 2010 p c i the percentage of observations bracketed by the 95ci used by lu et al 2009 and p u c i the percentage of observations bracketed by the unit confidence interval proposed by li et al 2011 these indices are described below 21 a r i l 1 n l i m i t u p p e r t l i m i t l o w e r t q o b s t where q o b s t is the observed flow at time t l i m i t u p p e r t and l i m i t l o w e r t are the calculated upper and lower limits for t th month respectively and n is the number of time steps a smaller a r i l value represents a better performance 22 p c i n q i n n where n q i n is the number of observations which are contained within the confidence interval it measures the reliability of the predictive distributions 23 p u c i 1 a b s p c i 0 95 a r i l p u c i was proposed as it was not adequate to judge the uncertainty results by only a r i l or p c i it is only used in 95 confidence interval evaluation larger the p u c i lower the uncertainty of 95 confidence interval of discharge is 2 5 5 simulation of base flow in kabini the basin was discretised to 88 grids of size 5 km 5 km the parameter values for the 60 grids corresponding to muthankera basin was to be retained as the optimal parameter values obtained from calibration of the model the parameters sy and t have been kept homogeneous throughout the 88 grids the model was run for varying combinations of recharge factor and discharge factor for the grids pertaining to the transition zone on a daily scale for the time period of 1991 2016 the lack of groundwater level data impedes applying the above framework to model base flow in the transition region hence we sought the integrated application of the subsurface model and a digital filter to model this region the filter was used to obtain a base flow hydrograph for the transition region this is under the assumption that whichever filter was deemed suitable for the muthankera basin would hold for the transition region as well calibration of the model could be done against the observed base flow for the dry weather months jan mar the period with no trend would have to be chosen for this exercise as the model would be run on conditions of zero draft initially distinct hydrologic signatures from the basin were also used to make up for the absence of groundwater level data for calibration 2 6 model evaluation statics 2 6 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency n s e 24 n s e 1 i 0 n y i o b s y i s i m 2 i 0 n y i o b s y i m e a n 2 where y i o b s is the ith observation for the

the results of the recession analysis performed using the mrc and irs methods are depicted in fig 2 the variability in the computed recession constant values was lower for the irs method the values computed by the irs method using 30 years of data were chosen as the recession constant for the basins base flow realisations were generated by varying a and b f i m a x in the range 0 90 0 95 and 0 25 0 30 respectively k was varied between 0 90 and 0 92 for muthankera and 0 86 to 0 89 for kabini trend analysis showed that all the base flow time series concurred in reporting the presence or absence of trends significant at α 0 05 fig 2 c all the base flow realisations showed no trend in muthankera and a significant declining trend in kabini storm flow series were obtained by subtracting the separated base flow time series from the streamflow series trend analysis performed on these storm flow realisations showed that there was a significant trend in kabini except for a few realisations fig 2d to determine if the trend was caused due to the trend in rainfall over the basin the mann kendall test was performed on the basin averaged rainfall as well as the data from individual rain gauges no trend was observed in the annual rainfall time series for the period of analysis table 2 in general the trend in base flow has been attributed broadly to the climate and land use changes in past studies from studies on forested basins in similar climatic regimes it has been concluded that they contribute to decreased runoff due to greater evapotranspiration as compared to areas under shorter land covers the deep tree roots abstract water from the unsaturated zone during the transpiration process which impacts the recharge to groundwater and displays large inter year variations in the same maréchal et al 2009 ruiz et al 2010 3 2 calibration of a physically based model to simulate base flow the dotty plots from the glue analysis showed that the discharge factor and recharge factor were the most sensitive parameters for base flow simulation fig 3 the likelihood combination l3 had the lowest aril value and l2 had the highest pci value since l2 had the largest puci consequently l2 was adopted for estimating the optimal parameters table 3 the parameter values from the behavioural set corresponding to l2 that gave the highest value of likelihood were adopted as the optimal parameter values to simulate base flow for the basin the optimal parameters for the muthankera basin were computed as sy 0 025 rf 0 15 pd 0 96 and t 38 m2 day the model was calibrated from 2000 to 2009 and validated from 2010 to 2016 fig 4 the performance of simulated base flow from the subsurface model was evaluated against various parameterisation schemes of recursive digital filters lyne hollick filter lh was evaluated with filter parameter value of 0 925 as suggested by nathan and mcmahon 1990 eckhardt filter eck has two parameters k which is the recession constant the median values computed by irs method using 30 years of data were chosen as the recession constant for the basins obtained as 0 91 for muthankera and 0 88 for kabini since the basin lies on a hard rock aquifer and has a perennial stream b f i m a x was set as 0 25 as suggested by eckhardt 2005 chapman maxwell filter cm has only one parameter which is the recession constant k boughton filter b has a parameter c that requires calibration but unlike b f i m a x no suggested values have been given in literature lyne hollick filter with the filter parameter value of 0 925 yielded satisfactory values of nse and rsr but was found to over simulate base flow as compared to the model output simulated base flow was seen to better compare to the base flow separated from eckhardt filter the lyne hollick and chapman maxwell filters yielded larger peaks of base flow as compared to the eckhardt filter fig 5 a parameters of the recursive digital filters were calibrated with respect to the base flow simulated from the sub surface model table 4 both boughton and eckhardt filters gave the best values for the model evaluation statics and eckhardt filter gave the least standard error to compare the variations in bfi values computed using the base flow separated from digital filters base flow series were generated for the calibrated filter parameter ranges the filter parameter ranges used is given in table 4 it is seen that the variability in bfi computed is greatest for lyne hollick filters as compared to eckhardt and boughton filters the median values for the eckhardt and boughton filters are similar but lyne hollick filter seems to generate values very different from the other two filters for post monsoon periods fig 5b hence eckhardt filter seems to compare best to the output from the calibrated subsurface model the mean annual bfi values were computed at muthankera to be 0 236 0 02 there was minimal difference in the annual and wet season bfi but the dry season bfi was computed to be much higher the mean seasonal bfi varied from 48 during post monsoon periods to 21 during monsoon periods table 5 the 95ci plots from glue analysis was plotted for 2000 2010 the observed base flow was seen to fall within the 95ci bands in the calibration period hence the model can be established to give reliable simulations of base flow for the basin fig 6 the observed base flow shown in the 95ci plots was the base flow separated by using eckhardt filter the filtered base flow has been used in the figures so as to depict how well the model has simulated base flow across all the years in the calibration period and not just with respect to the few recession segments in periods of no rain events the fact that the base flow simulated by the model was very comparable to the output from the eckhardt filter only adds to the robustness of the model this is because eckhardt filter has been widely cited to be a suitable baseflow separation method for many river basins gonzales et al 2009 kouanda et al 2018 xie et al 2020 to our knowledge this is the first study that has done a comparison of various filters in this basin as well as used a physically based model to simulate base flow evaluating the output from other recursive filters against the simulated base flow brought out the fact that the filter parameter values suggested in literature does not always realistically compute base flow there were large variations in the bfi computed by various filters hence to bridge the uncertainty it is required to calibrate the digital filters with respect to the basin studied 3 3 simulation of base flow from kabini basin it has been established in the previous section that eckhardt filter was suitable for base flow separation in muthankera so it was used to compute the observed base flow in kabini as well the model was calibrated against the observed base flow for the dry weather months jan mar from 1992 to 1999 the model was run with zero draft and hence it was assumed that the years picked for calibration had minimal impact of draft the best 5 parameter set from a monte carlo simulation of 200 runs yielded the optimal parameters as rf 0 119 and pd 0 979 fig 8a since there was no groundwater level data in the transition zone two hydrologic signatures that differentiated the nested basins had to be used for calibration of parameters they were i the long term averaged base flow ratio of kabini to muthankera revealed that the ratios in the dry months were much higher compared to the wet months ii the declining trend in base flow in kabini and the absence of the same in muthankera fig 7 the absolute error between the observed and simulated long term averaged base flow ratio of kabini to muthankera was the least for pd 0 976 fig 8 b hence the optimal parameters for the transition zone were fixed as sy 0 025 rf 0 12 pd 0 98 and t 38 m2 day the calibration and validation plots showed that the model was able to simulate the flood and drought years reasonably fig 8 the bias for the validation years was high which was possibly due to not incorporating the trend component to the model the long term averaged ratios of simulated base flow at kabini to muthankera was able to reproduce higher ratios in dry months compared to wet months as was seen in the observed time series fig 9 a initial estimate for the draft was estimated from the observed annual base flow time series the draft was added uniformly to the 28 grids the draft time series was iteratively fitted so as to match the observed annual base flow series it should be noted that this draft is not a measure of the actual draft in the basin as we have assumed it to be zero where a trend was not explicitly depicted in the base flow hydrographs hence the draft computed by this model here should be regarded as in addition to the draft that was already present in the region fig 9 b this depicts the groundwater depletion from the storage and is very non linear which is typical of forested basins in sub humid to semi arid climate regimes the mann kendall test on the mean annual time series of simulated base flow from kabini basin reported a declining trend significant at α 0 05 p value was obtained as 0 02 and a sen s slope of 0 51 the result of the calibration exercise was getting some insights into the base flow generation process in the basin the fact that a base flow trend was absent in muthankera sub basin though a trend was observed at the downstream gauge called for looking into how the two regions differ could it be that though the terrain is similar in both the transition zone is more forested than the upstream region the high spatial variability in both precipitation and land use between muthankera basin and the transition region could as well be probable attributes to the distinct patterns of hydrologic response observed the lack of groundwater observation wells makes it difficult to draw any conclusions regarding the groundwater level behaviour in the region the recharge factor was obtained to be lower in the transition region than in the humid region it is consistent with the widely accepted theory that basins with forest cover have lower groundwater recharge rates than other land use especially in tropical watersheds limited by water availability maréchal et al 2009 owuor et al 2016 this has been attributed to the high evapotranspiration rates from the forest cover the discharge factor which is analogous to the delay in base flow response to recharge was found to be greater in the transition zone this would imply that in the transition region the base flow is generated more gradually in comparison to the humid region groundwater recharge is buffered in the transition area due to the uptake of water by deep rooted trees during evapotranspiration from the unsaturated zone which causes a delay in the water table response and in turn translates to the delay in the base flow generation process presence of laterites in the humid zone might accelerate the drainage of the groundwater reservoir to contribute to the base flow but the reverse is true for the transition area with red soils the presence of varying soil types in the two regions is itself a consequence of the varying climate regime in both the longer residence time of base flow in the transition area is possibly why the region has more base flow than the humid region in the dry months the loss from the groundwater storage computed from the model was found to be highly nonlinear this is characteristic of forested catchments in similar climatic regimes as the basin under study water uptake by deep roots in the unsaturated zone can play a role in controlling water balance in forested catchments and cause large year to year variability 4 conclusions base flow was simulated from a sub humid tropical basin using a distributed sub surface model a framework for simulating daily base flow from the model by calibrating against groundwater levels as well as streamflow data was put forth in this study glue analysis was adopted to the simulation of base flow and the most sensitive parameters were identified as the recharge factor and the discharge factor the observed base flow was seen to fall within the 95ci bands hence the model can be established to give reliable simulations of base flow for the basin the base flow output from the model was compared with various parameterisations of four recursive digital filters the base flow from eckhardt filter was seen to compare best with the model output with respect to fit with daily base flow series and bfi eckhardt filter has been widely cited to be a suitable base flow separation method for many river basins gonzales et al 2009 kouanda et al 2018 xie et al 2020 a combination of eckhardt filter and distributed groundwater model was used to model the temporally varying base flow in the basin two distinct hydrologic signatures were identified and were utilised in the calibration of the transition zone the consequence of the calibration exercise on kabini basin was establishing that the heterogeneity in terms of precipitation and land use has resulted in the distinct hydrologic responses from the two regions in the basin the loss from the groundwater storage computed from the model was found to be highly nonlinear the recharge factor was obtained to be lower in the transition region compared to the humid region which is attributed to the high evapotranspiration from the forest cover in the transition region discharge factor was greater in transition region which implies that there is greater delay in base flow response to the recharge it has been noted that laterite soils present in the humid region could result in faster drainage from groundwater storage as compared to the red soils in transition region water uptake from unsaturated zone by deep rooted trees can translate to a delay in water table response and hence base flow generation future research could focus on the following calibrating the model with additional data of base flow separated using chemical based methods or water isotopes could improve the accuracy of the base flow estimation the model has been applied on a mountainous basin on a hard rock aquifer in this study and the same can be extended to other aquifer

2875,a novel framework that integrally uses groundwater and streamflow observations to calibrate a physically based sub surface model to generate base flow on a daily time step is presented in this study trend analysis on mean annual base flow time series showed that a declining trend was present in the basin though the upstream humid region was devoid of any trend glue analysis was adopted to the simulation of base flow in the humid region and the most sensitive parameters were identified as the recharge factor rf and discharge factor pd the model was able to satisfactorily simulate base flow as observed values fell within the 95ci bands for the calibration period the mean annual bfi values were computed at muthankera to be 0 236 0 02 the mean seasonal bfi varied from 48 during post monsoon periods to 21 during monsoon periods the base flow simulated by the model was comparable to the output from the eckhardt filter which has been widely cited to be a suitable baseflow separation method for many river basins due to the absence of groundwater level data in the transition region a combination of model and digital filter was used to calibrate that region the draft from the groundwater storage computed from the model was found to be highly nonlinear the rf was seen to be lower and pd to be higher in the transition region than in the humid region this would imply that in the transition region the base flow is generated more gradually in comparison to the humid region this was characteristic of forested basins where the uptake of water by deep rooted trees during evapotranspiration from the unsaturated zone causes delay in the water table response which in turn could result in delay in the base flow generation process the consequence of the calibration exercise on kabini basin was establishing that the heterogeneity in terms of precipitation and land use has resulted in the distinct hydrologic responses from the two regions in the basin keywords baseflow modelling physically based subsurface modelling recession constant digital filtering baseflow index trend analysis data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction base flow is the streamflow component that comes from groundwater storage during prolonged dry periods and hence can be considered as representative of the catchment physiographic characteristics hall 1968 wittenberg and sivapalan 1999 hydrograph separation of base flow has remained a relevant research area for long because of the insights they provide into the catchment hydrology for example high base flow indices and large recession constants imply a perennial river with large contribution from sub surface stores reilly and kroll 2003 smakhtin 2001 vogel and kroll 1996 in basins with long intervals between precipitation events the river flow is sustained by base flow thus is vital for aquatic habitats choi et al 2018 fan et al 2013 hayes et al 2018 studies have shown that climate variability and land use changes attribute to changes in base flow and that base flow feedback to global warming has been extreme ahiablame et al 2017 ficklin et al 2016 zhang and schilling 2006 accurate quantification and modelling of base flow is thus imperative considering the wide gap that is being projected between water supply and demand miller et al 2016 hydrologic modelling studies mostly focus on how best the peak flow is modelled and the realistic simulation of base flow is often overlooked lo et al 2008 uncertainty in base flow modelling is high because of the difficulty in measuring base flow in the field partington et al 2012 recursive digital filters are the most widely used methods for estimating base flow from streamflow hydrographs they work based on filtering out high frequency signals like that of quick flow from low frequency signals similar to that of base flow lyne and hollick 1979 nathan and mcmahon 1990 though perfect for long term base flow estimation these methods have been criticised for lacking a physical basis chapman 1991 though default filter parameter values have been suggested for the many widely used filters various studies have brought out the need to calibrate the parameters specific to the region of application eckhardt 2005 lim et al 2010 tracer based methods have been used in various studies to calibrate the filters kouanda et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 they have been reported to be labour intensive and that the presence of large uncertainties in the results increases with the time period of the study gonzales et al 2009 lott and stewart 2016 studies have demonstrated how base flow can be separated by using groundwater levels and based on relationship between groundwater table and stream discharge the need for groundwater level measurements with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution may particularly limit its use holko et al 2002 peters and van lanen 2005 studies on base flow simulation using physically based models say conceptual models hydrologic models and groundwater models are not extensive in literature the merit of this approach is that the physical basis of the models gives the base flow outputs from them more plausibility additionally future forecasting studies can be carried out using the models given the forecasted climatological inputs conceptual modelling of base flow basically consists of one or several conceptual reservoirs and a linear or nonlinear storage outflow function it has been indicated that arriving at the right model structure and parameterisation is challenging and that choosing an optimal storage outflow structure for a large number of catchments would be a compromise stoelzle et al 2015 traditionally hydrologic models have incorporated such conceptual models to simulate groundwater discharge luo et al 2012 modified such a conceptual base flow module in the hydrological model swat such that the single reservoir approach was replaced with a two linear reservoir approach and then later in gan and luo 2013 the single linear reservoir was replaced with a non linear reservoir approach karki et al 2021 studied the base flow simulation capability of a similar conceptual module based on an exponential storage discharge function in the national water model fully integrated models have been used to simulate base flow in a synthetic setting which was then used to assess the performance and adequacy of various recursive digital filters for varying rainfall scenarios and catchment characteristics li et al 2013 li et al 2014 partington et al 2012 su et al 2016 this paper puts forward a framework for base flow simulation using a distributed groundwater model the model used in this study ambhasgw is a two dimensional distributed model that is capable of modelling spatially variable recharge and pumping the model essentially solves for the two dimensional ground water equations for an unconfined aquifer it uses an operator split approach wherein the hydraulic head is updated for the vertical flux in each grid then for base flow discharge and finally for lateral flux between the grids scheidegger et al 2021 subash et al 2017 tomer et al 2021 the objectives of this study are to 1 present a new modelling framework to simulate base flow from a subsurface model using both groundwater and streamflow observations for calibration 2 model a temporally varying base flow in a tropical basin by integrating the modelling framework and a recursive digital filter 3 understand the base flow generation and trends in the basin the novel contributions of this study are as follows base flow is simulated at a daily time step using a distributed two dimensional groundwater model from a real basin for a period of 25 years the calibration is done against observed groundwater levels and streamflow data integrally further the performance of four digital filters for various parameterisations are compared against the simulated base flow from the calibrated model the modelling framework is applied to a sub humid tropical river basin characterised by a sharp climatic gradient and trends the kabini basin is highly heterogeneous such that the region up to muthankera basin which is nested in the basin is humid with no temporal variation in base flow and groundwater levels but the region downstream is sub humid heavily forested and it has been reported in earlier studies that streamflow in kabini during the dry weather period indicated a declining trend sekhar et al 2016 to our knowledge there has not been any study where base flow for this region has been modelled 2 methodology 2 1 study area and data the kabini basin is a tributary of the river cauvery and is located on the western ghats india the region up to the kabini dam in the basin has been chosen for the study and will henceforth be referred to as kabini basin in this paper fig 1 the basin lies such that it forms a barrier to the monsoonal winds coming from the indian ocean and moving north east resulting in a steep decline in the annual rainfall as one move eastwards into the basin table 1 the basin can be differentiated into two regions the region upstream extending up to the muthankera gauge muthankera basin falls in a humid zone which receives 1500 2500 mm of average annual rainfall the region between the muthankera gauge and the kabini dam transition zone gets an annual average rainfall of 1000 1500 mm and is a sub humid zone in addition to the precipitation gradient the two regions have distinct land cover the humid zone is dominated by plantation land cover and the sub humid zone comprises predominantly of forest cover the soils of the basin are fine textured comprising of laterites forest loam and riverine alluvium the humid zone has a lateritic cover and thick mature saprolite and the sub humid zone has red and black soil system with thick immature saprolite the basin lies on a gneissic complex with few strips of schist formations hornblende gneiss covers the humid zone and the sub humid zone is underlain by leucocratic gneiss soumya et al 2013 the choice of this basin was motivated by the presence of significant base flow trends the trends of dry weather stream flow in the kabini river over three decades indicated a significant decline sekhar et al 2016 this is characteristic of the large scale groundwater depletion across the indian sub continent mukherjee et al 2018 rodell et al 2009 the hydrology of the basin has been monitored since 1974 by the central water commission cwc at muthankera and at kabini dam by the karnataka water resources department the daily rainfall data was obtained for the period from 1991 to 2016 from seven rain gauging stations in and around the basin the rain gauge stations 1 4 were monitored by the indian meteorological department imd and the ones numbered 5 7 were monitored by karnataka state natural disaster monitoring centre ksndmc depth to groundwater level data was obtained from the central groundwater board india through the india wris portal depth to gwl data was available for four seasons namely pre monsoon monsoon post monsoon kharif post monsoon rabi for the period from 1996 to 2017 2 2 base flow separation using digital filters in order to ascertain the trend base flow was separated using existing digital filtering methods they are briefly mentioned below 2 2 1 lyne hollick filter lyne and hollick 1979 proposed the filter equation 1 q d i a q d i 1 1 a 2 q i q i 1 subject to 2 q d i 0 and 3 q b i q i q d i where q is the total streamflow m3 s q d is the quickflow m3 s q b is the base flow m3 s i is the daily time step and a is the filter parameter this technique was developed on the basis of signal processing that filtering out high frequency signals was intuitively analogous to the separation of low frequency base flow from higher frequencies of quick flow nathan and mcmahon 1990 suggested that the value of filter parameter in the range 0 90 0 95 yielded the most acceptable base flow separation they applied the lyne hollick algorithm to 186 catchments of sizes in the range of 4 2 210 km2 they noted that compared to the existing base flow separation methods at the time this filter reflected the negligible base flow contributions better was less variable and gave closest estimates to that from widely accepted manual separation technique based on the master recession curve 2 2 2 chapman maxwell filter chapman 1991 noted that the lyne hollick algorithm implied that when direct runoff ceased the base flow was constant which was not in accordance with the recession theory he suggested an improved algorithm where the filter parameter now assumed hydrological significance as the recession constant when the quick flow response has ceased 4 q b i 3 k 1 3 k q b i 1 1 k 3 k q i q i 1 subject to 5 q b i q i where k is the filter parameter analogous to the recession constant chapman and maxwell 1996 simplified the equation to 6 q b i k 2 k q b i 1 1 k 2 k q i which provided identical results to the earlier form eckhardt 2005 2 2 3 boughton filter boughton used a base flow separation algorithm in the awbm model he developed in 1993 chapman 1999 the filter equation is as follows 7 q b i k 1 c q b i 1 c 1 c q i subject to eq 5 is a modification to the chapman maxwell algorithm giving it more flexibility by replacing the term 1 k with parameter c 2 2 4 eckhardt filter eckhardt filter is a two parameter recursive filter which is mathematically expressed as 8 q b i 1 b f i m a x k q b i 1 1 k b f i m a x q i 1 k b f i m a x subject to eq 5 where k is the recession constant and b f i m a x is the maximum base flow index that can be modelled by the algorithm eckhardt 2005 suggested to set b f i m a x 0 80 for perennial streams with porous aquifers b f i m a x 0 50 for ephemeral streams with porous aquifers and b f i m a x 0 25 for perennial streams with hard rock aquifers the filter parameter k can be determined from recession analysis b f i m a x was found to be the less critical parameter in the filter which was helpful considering it cannot be derived from streamflow records it was stated that an uncertainty of 19 in the b f i m a x leads to a mean error of 5 in the calculation of bfi eckhardt 2012 it was advised that b f i m a x be chosen depending on the hydrogeological conditions of a catchment say by calibration against results from a tracer based separation 2 3 estimation of recession constant the recession constant is one of the filter parameters that need to be calibrated in order to separate base flow from streamflow manual on low flow estimation and prediction has two methods for performing recession analysis in a humid catchment which is constantly interrupted by rainfall events resulting in a series of recession segments the two methods can be classified as those involving construction of a master recession curve mrc and those performing a separate calculation of parameters from individual recession segments irs gustard and demuth 2008 starting point of the recession for individual segments is usually set to the first value below the q 70 threshold at least two days after the peak flood discharge duration of recession in the various segments was uniformly truncated to seven days to reduce variability many samples of varying sizes say 5 10 20 and 30 years were selected from 40 years of streamflow data recession analysis was performed on all the samples to ascertain the uncertainty in the estimated recession constant value incurred from varying the sample size chosen for the analysis 2 4 trend analysis the mann kendall test was used to evaluate temporal trends in base flow in the kabini for the period of 1992 to 2016 mann 1945 presented a non parametric test for randomness against time which is a particular application of kendall s test for correlation kendall 1975 also known as kendal s tau the null hypothesis of randomness ho states that the data x1 x2 xn are a sample of n independent and identically distributed random variables the alternate hypothesis h1 is that the data follow a monotonic trend over time the test statistic is defined as 9 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s g n x j x k where 10 s g n x 1 x 0 0 x 0 1 x 0 kendall 1975 showed that s is asymptotically normally distributed and gave the mean and variance of s for the situation where there may be ties in the x values as 11 e s 0 12 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 j 1 p t j t j 1 2 t j 5 18 where p is the number of tied groups in the data set and t j is the number of data points in the jth tied group a positive value of s indicates that there is an upward trend in which the observations increase with time hipel and mcleod 1994 the temporal variation in base flow from the kabini basin was studied for a period of 25 years from 1992 to 2016 using the mann kendall test trend analysis was performed on time series of mean annual values of base flow the lyne hollick filter and eckhardt filter were used to separate the base flow because ranges of filter parameters for which these filters generated acceptable base flow values in various catchments have been documented in past studies ideally the filters should be calibrated for the region but since such studies have not been done for this basin we used the parameter ranges provided in literature filter parameter values in the range of 0 90 0 95 has been suggested for generating plausible base flow values using the lyne hollick filter the parameter bfi max in eckhardt filter was set as 0 25 since the basin rested on a hard rock aquifer the other filter parameter in the eckhardt filter is the recession constant which was computed from recession analysis the recession analysis was performed using two methods the master recession curve mrc method and the individual recession segments irs method 2 5 modelling framework to simulate base flow 2 5 1 model description ambhasgw is a spatially distributed two dimensional subsurface model that implements transient groundwater modelling horan et al 2021 scheidegger et al 2021 sekhar et al 2018 subash et al 2017 tomer et al 2017 2021 the model solves for the two dimensional groundwater flow equation for an unconfined aquifer it uses an operator split approach wherein first the grids are updated with the net recharge and computes the base flow from each grid and later simulates the horizontal distribution of the flow in grids based on the diffusivity the model requires inputs of initial head and net recharge recharge draft the parameters that need to be calibrated are specific yield sy recharge factor r f discharge factor p d transmissivity t and the hydraulic head corresponding to zero baseflow denoted as hmin the parameters rf pd and hmin can be set as spatially varying in the model the two dimensional equation for a homogeneous isotropic and unconfined aquifer can be written as 13 x h h x y h h y sy k h t q where sy is the specific yield h is the hydraulic head m k is the hydraulic conductivity m day and q is the source sink term x and y are the coordinates m and t is the time days if the drawdown in the aquifer is very small compared to the saturated thickness h can be replaced with an average thickness b assumed to be constant over the aquifer and kb can be replaced by transmissivity t the equation can thus be linearised by this approximation fetter 2007 p 135 the two dimensional transient groundwater flow equation is solved using an operator split approach first the equation is solved vertically for the source sink term q b then it is solved horizontally for the lateral flow tomer et al 2021 the numerical solution for the vertical fluxes is described in subash et al 2017 and is described briefly here sat kumar 2010 improved upon an analytical model developed to predict water table fluctuations based on discrete record of precipitation developed by park and parker 2008 by the addition of a draft term the solution for the recharge abstraction is done independently for each grid the governing equation is given by 14 dh dt λ h sy rf r sy d net sy where h is the groundwater level m t is the time days sy is the specific yield λ is the discharge constant r is the rainfall m rf is the recharge factor and d net is the net groundwater draft m the solution of eq 13 is given in appendix a in subash et al 2017 the solution is given as 15 h t 1 p d h t g u where h t 1 is the head at time step t 1 pd 1 λ s y g p d s y and u r f r d net the above equation implies that baseflow would be generated till the groundwater level reaches 0 which might not be realistic and baseflow might cease at some level hence the equation was modified as 16 h t 1 h m i n p d h t h m i n g u after the hydraulic head has been updated for recharge and abstraction the vertical flux term can be omitted from the linearised form of eq 13 and can be solved for the lateral flow by using a finite difference method 2 5 2 model simulation the spatial domain of the watershed was discretised to 5 km 5 km grids fig 1 the srtm 90 m digital elevation model was used to establish elevation of the land grid the external boundary of the study area was assumed to be a zero flux condition rainfall in each grid was obtained using the thiessen method on the rainfall data at seven stations in and near the basin the parameter values for sy rf pd and t has been kept homogeneous throughout the grids the muthankera basin was chosen for the calibration of the model in this section as the availability of groundwater level data was restricted to the region the draft in the basin was assumed to be zero the basin was discretised to 60 grids the initial head was kept as 6 m below the mean elevation of the grid the value for parameter hmin was set below the lowest elevation among the pixels in each grid and was spatially varying the simulation was done on a daily time step the glue analysis was adopted to the simulation of daily base flow in muthankera basin 2 5 3 parameter estimation using glue the glue method which was proposed by beven and binley 1992 is a monte carlo based approach which uses a large number of model runs with different randomly chosen parameter values selected from a priori probability distribution the likelihood function is calculated for each set of parameters the acceptability of each run is evaluated against observed values on the basis of a subjective threshold the run is considered to be non behavioral if the acceptability falls below the threshold which is defined by a giving an allowable deviation to the highest likelihood value in this study parameter sets with a sample size of 1000 were generated by latin hypercube sampling from a uniform distribution of parameter space the parameter range was varied between 0 005 and 0 12 for specific yield and between 0 01 and 0 30 for recharge factor this was fixed based on estimates of the aquifer parameters for upper cauvery basin through hydrochemistry studies siva soumya 2009 discharge factor was varied between 0 90 and 0 99 and transmissivity was set to vary between 20 and 80 m2 day the output variables considered for calibration were the difference in groundwater levels between the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons gwl grd and streamflow data during recession segments in between the months of january and march q dry the recession segments of streamflow hydrographs for specific years with no precipitation events in the period from dec mar namely 2004 2005 2007 2008 and 2009 were used for calibration in addition to the groundwater level data from 2000 to 2009 the grids which contained at least two observation wells were considered for the calibration the likelihood measure was selected so as to represent the goodness of fit of both the variables combinations of coefficient of determination rsq and rescaled root mean square error rmsesc were taken as the likelihood criterion root mean square error was rescaled by dividing it by the maximum root mean square value in the sample the likelihood functions were set in the following combinations 17 l 1 0 33 r s q q d r y 0 33 r s q g w l g r d 0 33 r m s e s c g w l g r d 18 l 2 0 50 r s q q d r y 0 25 r s q g w l g r d 0 25 r m s e s c g w l g r d 19 l 3 0 25 r s q q d r y 0 5 r s q g w l g r d 0 25 r m s e s c g w l g r d 20 l 4 0 25 r s q q d r y 0 25 r s q g w l g r d 0 50 r m s e s c g w l g r d since values greater than 0 50 is considered acceptable for coefficient of determination with reference to moriasi et al 2007 threshold values for the likelihood functions are set accordingly the subjectivity involved in fixing the threshold value is regarded as a drawback of the glue technique since past studies have emphasized that parameter uncertainty and simulation results are sensitive to the choice of threshold values jin et al 2010 thus fixing the threshold values in accordance with already accepted model evaluation performance ratings facilitates minimizing the subjectivity involved 2 5 4 parameter uncertainty the 95 confidence intervals for base flow due to parameter uncertainty were obtained from the mean monthly values of base flow for the periods used in calibration in this study three indices were used to further compare the derived 95ci a r i l average relative interval length defined by jin et al 2010 p c i the percentage of observations bracketed by the 95ci used by lu et al 2009 and p u c i the percentage of observations bracketed by the unit confidence interval proposed by li et al 2011 these indices are described below 21 a r i l 1 n l i m i t u p p e r t l i m i t l o w e r t q o b s t where q o b s t is the observed flow at time t l i m i t u p p e r t and l i m i t l o w e r t are the calculated upper and lower limits for t th month respectively and n is the number of time steps a smaller a r i l value represents a better performance 22 p c i n q i n n where n q i n is the number of observations which are contained within the confidence interval it measures the reliability of the predictive distributions 23 p u c i 1 a b s p c i 0 95 a r i l p u c i was proposed as it was not adequate to judge the uncertainty results by only a r i l or p c i it is only used in 95 confidence interval evaluation larger the p u c i lower the uncertainty of 95 confidence interval of discharge is 2 5 5 simulation of base flow in kabini the basin was discretised to 88 grids of size 5 km 5 km the parameter values for the 60 grids corresponding to muthankera basin was to be retained as the optimal parameter values obtained from calibration of the model the parameters sy and t have been kept homogeneous throughout the 88 grids the model was run for varying combinations of recharge factor and discharge factor for the grids pertaining to the transition zone on a daily scale for the time period of 1991 2016 the lack of groundwater level data impedes applying the above framework to model base flow in the transition region hence we sought the integrated application of the subsurface model and a digital filter to model this region the filter was used to obtain a base flow hydrograph for the transition region this is under the assumption that whichever filter was deemed suitable for the muthankera basin would hold for the transition region as well calibration of the model could be done against the observed base flow for the dry weather months jan mar the period with no trend would have to be chosen for this exercise as the model would be run on conditions of zero draft initially distinct hydrologic signatures from the basin were also used to make up for the absence of groundwater level data for

the results of the recession analysis performed using the mrc and irs methods are depicted in fig 2 the variability in the computed recession constant values was lower for the irs method the values computed by the irs method using 30 years of data were chosen as the recession constant for the basins base flow realisations were generated by varying a and b f i m a x in the range 0 90 0 95 and 0 25 0 30 respectively k was varied between 0 90 and 0 92 for muthankera and 0 86 to 0 89 for kabini trend analysis showed that all the base flow time series concurred in reporting the presence or absence of trends significant at α 0 05 fig 2 c all the base flow realisations showed no trend in muthankera and a significant declining trend in kabini storm flow series were obtained by subtracting the separated base flow time series from the streamflow series trend analysis performed on these storm flow realisations showed that there was a significant trend in kabini except for a few realisations fig 2d to determine if the trend was caused due to the trend in rainfall over the basin the mann kendall test was performed on the basin averaged rainfall as well as the data from individual rain gauges no trend was observed in the annual rainfall time series for the period of analysis table 2 in general the trend in base flow has been attributed broadly to the climate and land use changes in past studies from studies on forested basins in similar climatic regimes it has been concluded that they contribute to decreased runoff due to greater evapotranspiration as compared to areas under shorter land covers the deep tree roots abstract water from the unsaturated zone during the transpiration process which impacts the recharge to groundwater and displays large inter year variations in the same maréchal et al 2009 ruiz et al 2010 3 2 calibration of a physically based model to simulate base flow the dotty plots from the glue analysis showed that the discharge factor and recharge factor were the most sensitive parameters for base flow simulation fig 3 the likelihood combination l3 had the lowest aril value and l2 had the highest pci value since l2 had the largest puci consequently l2 was adopted for estimating the optimal parameters table 3 the parameter values from the behavioural set corresponding to l2 that gave the highest value of likelihood were adopted as the optimal parameter values to simulate base flow for the basin the optimal parameters for the muthankera basin were computed as sy 0 025 rf 0 15 pd 0 96 and t 38 m2 day the model was calibrated from 2000 to 2009 and validated from 2010 to 2016 fig 4 the performance of simulated base flow from the subsurface model was evaluated against various parameterisation schemes of recursive digital filters lyne hollick filter lh was evaluated with filter parameter value of 0 925 as suggested by nathan and mcmahon 1990 eckhardt filter eck has two parameters k which is the recession constant the median values computed by irs method using 30 years of data were chosen as the recession constant for the basins obtained as 0 91 for muthankera and 0 88 for kabini since the basin lies on a hard rock aquifer and has a perennial stream b f i m a x was set as 0 25 as suggested by eckhardt 2005 chapman maxwell filter cm has only one parameter which is the recession constant k boughton filter b has a parameter c that requires calibration but unlike b f i m a x no suggested values have been given in literature lyne hollick filter with the filter parameter value of 0 925 yielded satisfactory values of nse and rsr but was found to over simulate base flow as compared to the model output simulated base flow was seen to better compare to the base flow separated from eckhardt filter the lyne hollick and chapman maxwell filters yielded larger peaks of base flow as compared to the eckhardt filter fig 5 a parameters of the recursive digital filters were calibrated with respect to the base flow simulated from the sub surface model table 4 both boughton and eckhardt filters gave the best values for the model evaluation statics and eckhardt filter gave the least standard error to compare the variations in bfi values computed using the base flow separated from digital filters base flow series were generated for the calibrated filter parameter ranges the filter parameter ranges used is given in table 4 it is seen that the variability in bfi computed is greatest for lyne hollick filters as compared to eckhardt and boughton filters the median values for the eckhardt and boughton filters are similar but lyne hollick filter seems to generate values very different from the other two filters for post monsoon periods fig 5b hence eckhardt filter seems to compare best to the output from the calibrated subsurface model the mean annual bfi values were computed at muthankera to be 0 236 0 02 there was minimal difference in the annual and wet season bfi but the dry season bfi was computed to be much higher the mean seasonal bfi varied from 48 during post monsoon periods to 21 during monsoon periods table 5 the 95ci plots from glue analysis was plotted for 2000 2010 the observed base flow was seen to fall within the 95ci bands in the calibration period hence the model can be established to give reliable simulations of base flow for the basin fig 6 the observed base flow shown in the 95ci plots was the base flow separated by using eckhardt filter the filtered base flow has been used in the figures so as to depict how well the model has simulated base flow across all the years in the calibration period and not just with respect to the few recession segments in periods of no rain events the fact that the base flow simulated by the model was very comparable to the output from the eckhardt filter only adds to the robustness of the model this is because eckhardt filter has been widely cited to be a suitable baseflow separation method for many river basins gonzales et al 2009 kouanda et al 2018 xie et al 2020 to our knowledge this is the first study that has done a comparison of various filters in this basin as well as used a physically based model to simulate base flow evaluating the output from other recursive filters against the simulated base flow brought out the fact that the filter parameter values suggested in literature does not always realistically compute base flow there were large variations in the bfi computed by various filters hence to bridge the uncertainty it is required to calibrate the digital filters with respect to the basin studied 3 3 simulation of base flow from kabini basin it has been established in the previous section that eckhardt filter was suitable for base flow separation in muthankera so it was used to compute the observed base flow in kabini as well the model was calibrated against the observed base flow for the dry weather months jan mar from 1992 to 1999 the model was run with zero draft and hence it was assumed that the years picked for calibration had minimal impact of draft the best 5 parameter set from a monte carlo simulation of 200 runs yielded the optimal parameters as rf 0 119 and pd 0 979 fig 8a since there was no groundwater level data in the transition zone two hydrologic signatures that differentiated the nested basins had to be used for calibration of parameters they were i the long term averaged base flow ratio of kabini to muthankera revealed that the ratios in the dry months were much higher compared to the wet months ii the declining trend in base flow in kabini and the absence of the same in muthankera fig 7 the absolute error between the observed and simulated long term averaged base flow ratio of kabini to muthankera was the least for pd 0 976 fig 8 b hence the optimal parameters for the transition zone were fixed as sy 0 025 rf 0 12 pd 0 98 and t 38 m2 day the calibration and validation plots showed that the model was able to simulate the flood and drought years reasonably fig 8 the bias for the validation years was high which was possibly due to not incorporating the trend component to the model the long term averaged ratios of simulated base flow at kabini to muthankera was able to reproduce higher ratios in dry months compared to wet months as was seen in the observed time series fig 9 a initial estimate for the draft was estimated from the observed annual base flow time series the draft was added uniformly to the 28 grids the draft time series was iteratively fitted so as to match the observed annual base flow series it should be noted that this draft is not a measure of the actual draft in the basin as we have assumed it to be zero where a trend was not explicitly depicted in the base flow hydrographs hence the draft computed by this model here should be regarded as in addition to the draft that was already present in the region fig 9 b this depicts the groundwater depletion from the storage and is very non linear which is typical of forested basins in sub humid to semi arid climate regimes the mann kendall test on the mean annual time series of simulated base flow from kabini basin reported a declining trend significant at α 0 05 p value was obtained as 0 02 and a sen s slope of 0 51 the result of the calibration exercise was getting some insights into the base flow generation process in the basin the fact that a base flow trend was absent in muthankera sub basin though a trend was observed at the downstream gauge called for looking into how the two regions differ could it be that though the terrain is similar in both the transition zone is more forested than the upstream region the high spatial variability in both precipitation and land use between muthankera basin and the transition region could as well be probable attributes to the distinct patterns of hydrologic response observed the lack of groundwater observation wells makes it difficult to draw any conclusions regarding the groundwater level behaviour in the region the recharge factor was obtained to be lower in the transition region than in the humid region it is consistent with the widely accepted theory that basins with forest cover have lower groundwater recharge rates than other land use especially in tropical watersheds limited by water availability maréchal et al 2009 owuor et al 2016 this has been attributed to the high evapotranspiration rates from the forest cover the discharge factor which is analogous to the delay in base flow response to recharge was found to be greater in the transition zone this would imply that in the transition region the base flow is generated more gradually in comparison to the humid region groundwater recharge is buffered in the transition area due to the uptake of water by deep rooted trees during evapotranspiration from the unsaturated zone which causes a delay in the water table response and in turn translates to the delay in the base flow generation process presence of laterites in the humid zone might accelerate the drainage of the groundwater reservoir to contribute to the base flow but the reverse is true for the transition area with red soils the presence of varying soil types in the two regions is itself a consequence of the varying climate regime in both the longer residence time of base flow in the transition area is possibly why the region has more base flow than the humid region in the dry months the loss from the groundwater storage computed from the model was found to be highly nonlinear this is characteristic of forested catchments in similar climatic regimes as the basin under study water uptake by deep roots in the unsaturated zone can play a role in controlling water balance in forested catchments and cause large year to year variability 4 conclusions base flow was simulated from a sub humid tropical basin using a distributed sub surface model a framework for simulating daily base flow from the model by calibrating against groundwater levels as well as streamflow data was put forth in this study glue analysis was adopted to the simulation of base flow and the most sensitive parameters were identified as the recharge factor and the discharge factor the observed base flow was seen to fall within the 95ci bands hence the model can be established to give reliable simulations of base flow for the basin the base flow output from the model was compared with various parameterisations of four recursive digital filters the base flow from eckhardt filter was seen to compare best with the model output with respect to fit with daily base flow series and bfi eckhardt filter has been widely cited to be a suitable base flow separation method for many river basins gonzales et al 2009 kouanda et al 2018 xie et al 2020 a combination of eckhardt filter and distributed groundwater model was used to model the temporally varying base flow in the basin two distinct hydrologic signatures were identified and were utilised in the calibration of the transition zone the consequence of the calibration exercise on kabini basin was establishing that the heterogeneity in terms of precipitation and land use has resulted in the distinct hydrologic responses from the two regions in the basin the loss from the groundwater storage computed from the model was found to be highly nonlinear the recharge factor was obtained to be lower in the transition region compared to the humid region which is attributed to the high evapotranspiration from the forest cover in the transition region discharge factor was greater in transition region which implies that there is greater delay in base flow response to the recharge it has been noted that laterite soils present in the humid region could result in faster drainage from groundwater storage as compared to the red soils in transition region water uptake from unsaturated zone by deep rooted trees can translate to a delay in water table response and hence base flow generation future research could focus on the following calibrating the model with additional data of base flow separated using chemical based methods or water isotopes could improve the accuracy of the base flow estimation the model has been applied on a mountainous basin on a hard rock aquifer in this study and the same can be extended to other aquifer

2876,water options trading wot is an effective way to promote efficient allocation of water resources and to manage risks of water scarcity scientific prediction information can help hedge the risks brought by uncertain hydrological and market environment to wot however confronting with the prediction information irrigation areas characterizing with heterogeneous resource endowments often exhibit different willingness in wot therefore through using prediction information this study provides a novel perspective to assess the water option trading willingness wotw in irrigation areas with heterogeneous resource endowments firstly according to multi objective optimization and expected utility theory a three phase dynamic adjustment model involving tradable water prediction expected return analysis of wot and wotw calculation is constructed and integrated then based on three sets of comparative analysis data from 2014 to 2020 in five irrigated areas the influence mechanism of heterogeneous resource endowments on the evolution intensity and improvement potential of the wotw is analyzed and the option contract with optimal water demand to motivate the wotw in heterogeneous irrigation areas is proposed the results of the case study suggest that the wotw is largely affected by the matching equilibrium of water and arable land resources in irrigation areas larger water resource endowment per unit of arable land indicates smaller fluctuation of the wotw evolution and greater intensity and improvement potential of the wotw conversely larger inter annual variation of the water resource endowment per unit of arable land implies more inclination of the wotw intensity in irrigation areas to be weakened in which situation the irrigation areas prefer the option contracts with less water demand this study provides a new method and theoretical foundation for the optimal allocation and options trading of agricultural water resources keywords water option options trading willingness irrigated area heterogeneous resources endowments prediction information data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the crisis of water scarcity has been mushrooming in some developing and less developed regions worldwide which not only limits their economic development but also prevents the living standard of people who inhabit in these regions from being improved elevating the utilization of water resources therefore becomes the most crucial and urgent problem to be solved in order to realize sustainable development for countries and regions suffering with water crisis around the world tan and zhang 2018 in recent years the exercise of market economy and free competition enables trading water rights trading on the premise of water conservation transferring water resources from low efficiency regions to high efficiency ones under which circumstance water consumption intensive industries and consumers are being pushed in the teeth of the storm svensson et al 2021 womble and hanemann 2020 it has reached a consensus that the distinctive feature of agriculture characterizes with high water consumption yet relatively low water utilization efficiency for instance the available water resources consumed by agriculture accounts for more than 60 percent of the total water consumption in china whereas the effective water utilization rate remains merely 45 wei et al 2016 in this severe situation one of the effective countermeasures to balance water supply with water demand is to vigorously develop water saving agriculture while promoting the transmission of agricultural water to non agricultural water arellano gonzalez et al 2021 fang and zhang 2020 for this exploring the optimal allocation and rights trading of agricultural water resources has become an important issue applying traditional trading mechanism which lacks flexibility to water options is rendered less possible to neutralize the risks caused by the uncertainty of water supply and fluctuating water prices to hedge risks the idea of water options is proposed which gives potential traders permission to negotiate on water transaction price and volume offering contract holders the rights to buy or sell a certain amount of water at an agreed price during the contract period hansen et al 2014 rey et al 2016a comparing with other means of water trading such as spot market transaction water bank virtual water the water option contract is more flexible and reliable owing to the ever increasing popularity of water options in the research field of water management the water option trade wot exhibits great potential in various practical applications conrad and lópez 2002 delorit and block 2020 yan et al 2018 the irrigated area is the relatively independent management unit of agricultural planting which is usually in the position of water right transferor regulating water rights and water diversion as well as transmission and distribution system of the planting area however the market price of water trade still remains somehow uncertain which attributes to various influencing factors involving but not limited to complicated hydrological and market environment the information on tradable water of irrigated areas the water demand of transferee etc li et al 2014 therefore the premise of participating in wot is to adopt scientific methodology to guarantee accurate prediction thereby realizing effective coupling of forecast information and water option contract delorit et al 2019 wu et al 2021 moreover since the capability in risk prevention and profiting underlies the attitude of irrigation area toward the forecast information their water option trading willingness wotw is therefore affected by the attitude that closely correlates with the area s resource endowment delorit and block 2020 heterogeneity is a notion that describes the characteristic differences among objects although some studies assumed that individuals in economic activities are homogeneous and can be regarded as fundamental economic elements that are mutually replaceable however in reality this assumption fails to elaborate profound and volatile decision making behavior of individuals to which comprehensive analysis shall initiate from individual and or group heterogeneity perspectives instead huang et al 2020 tan et al 2020 therefore in order to activate the marketplace for trading agricultural water rights while improving water utilization efficiency it is of significant necessity to analyze the influence mechanism of heterogeneous resource endowments in irrigation areas on their wotw and to determine the optimal water option contracts maximizing the wotw willingness can be understood as the preference and intention that an individual is inclined to do something which is usually based on interests and trust liu et al 2019 scholz et al 2015 some studies measured and analyzed individual willingness in water resource utilization and management through modeling and empirical approaches contingent valuation method and binary profit model were used to assess farmers willingness to use treated wastewater deh haghi et al 2020 iftekhar et al 2021 wang et al 2017 proposed a two level multi objective planning model to obtain the optimal allocation of agricultural water resources and the transaction price of water options stimulating the willingness to save water in irrigation areas conrad et al 2017 conducted a discrete choice experiment to investigate farmers preference concerning water use policies such as water rights allocation and water rights trading during drought periods the study on wotw and its influencing mechanism is conductive to analyzing the internal driving force of trading behavior and to realizing the efficient transfer of water rights unfortunately few studies have discussed how to optimize the water consumption structure of irrigation areas to participate in wot when the tradable water is insufficient and the influence of the heterogeneous resource endowment of irrigation areas on their willingness to trade water options the existing researches on water option basically concentrate on its trading and pricing mechanisms hu et al 2021a ramos and garrido 2004 rey et al 2016b seidl et al 2020 conduct a quantitative survey of the water market in the murray darling basin which suggested that financial investors and large corporates are more likely to offer highly sophisticated temporary water trading products similar to water options vicuna et al 2018 discussed the optimal option trading mechanism for agricultural water during droughts and short term turbidity events in santiago a risk hedging model was applied to wot by yan et al 2018 providing the optimal trading strategy for water consumers ha and gao 2017 constructed an imprecise two stage mixed integer programming model to study the case of wot a pricing model for water option was proposed by cui and schreider 2009 to activate the australian water market according to the rationale of stochastic process with jumps however considering the trading and pricing mechanisms the expected return of wot with insufficient tradable water needs further investigation in order to eliminate uncertainties in wot accurate forecasting information and methods that can hedge risks in the trading were proposed wei and xie 2022 among them the grey model was proposed by deng 1982 exhibiting characteristics of small sample but high prediction accuracy which has been widely applied in various fields to predict population water consumption industrial output etc hu et al 2021b meng et al 2021 stochastic programming and the characterization of uncertain factors based on probability distribution are also effective methods li et al 2020b applied bayesian theorem to develop a forecasting model for tradable water and the probability distribution function pdf of water demand womble and hanemann 2020 assessed the transaction costs of water options by analyzing the pdf of collected procedural transaction costs zhang et al 2018 developed a double sided stochastic chance constrained linear fractional programming model to analyze the consumption of irrigation water under uncertainties based on maximum entropy model and probability distribution theory yan et al 2018 effectively predicted the runoff and spot market prices in wot as mentioned above individual preferences and behaviors are influenced by heterogeneous characteristics in the field of wot some scholars explored the influence of individual heterogeneity imposed on participant s decision making based on panel data fang and wu 2020 analyzed the performance of wot in irrigation areas with heterogeneous water pressure by constructing time varying did model wang et al 2022 developed the bltsfppb model by integrating bi level programming and bayesian model and explored the optimal allocation of water resources considering the subjectivity of water managers driven by water options trading delorit and block 2020 explored the influence of farmers heterogeneous risk attitudes on their water options investment and cooperation willingness in wot the tradable water involved in wot is determined by water resources endowment and crop planting composition within an irrigation area therefore the heterogeneity in arable land and in water resource endowments of irrigation areas must be considered in analyzing wotw nevertheless hardly can sufficient studies be found which propose specific research framework to explore the influence of heterogeneous resource endowments on the wotw in irrigation areas in response to the above problem this study aims at analyzing the influence of heterogeneous resource endowments imposed on the willingness of irrigation areas to participate in wot by optimizing their water consumption structure proposing the option contract with optimal water demand to activate the wotw in heterogeneous irrigation areas by coupling the multi objective optimal allocation model for crop planting water with the expected return and willingness calculation model of wot the novelty and contributions of this study are elaborated as follows 1 by coupling an multi objective optimal allocation model for crop planting water a model that calculates the expected return and willingness of wot is established providing a novel perspective with forecast information to assess the wotw in irrigation areas characterized with heterogeneous resource endowments 2 an interest trust motivated model that can dynamically update the wotw is proposed thereby enabling the model itself to accurately describe the evolution of wotw in irrigation areas with heterogeneous resource endowments after action review 3 four scenarios of contracted water demand are designed to stimulate the wotw in irrigation areas with heterogeneous endowments making breakthroughs in practical scale limitations of the proposed model in conclusion driven by wot this study provides insights into the optimal allocation of water resources in irrigation areas with heterogeneous resource endowments and the increase in wotw which is conducive to the efficient utilization of agricultural water resources the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 outlines the corresponding problem descriptions section 3 elaborates the detailed modelling process of our proposal consisting of tradable water prediction expected return analysis of wot and wotw calculation section 4 applies the developed model to bayannur section 5 summarizes the conclusions and future works of this paper 2 problem description 2 1 overview of the problem this study aims at exploring the influence mechanism of resource endowments of heterogeneous water and arable land on the wotw in irrigation areas advancing sound and reasonable suggestions for improving wot in irrigation areas with different resource endowments under the environment with uncertain risk where decision making is required by integrating three dynamic adjustment phases involving tradable water forecast expected return analysis of wot including the expected return of adjusting the planting structure and wotw calculation this study provides a novel perspective for assessing the wotw in irrigation areas with heterogeneous endowments to which the specific procedures are outlined as follows in phase 1 an optimal multi objective model is established to predict the tradable water and expected planting return in different irrigation areas in phase 2 the income scenarios of wot under uncertainties are analyzed according to the expected utility theory in phase 3 an interest trust motivated model is proposed to describe the evolution of wotw in irrigation areas to which the schematic diagram demonstrating the flow of the proposed framework is depicted in fig 1 2 2 tradable water prediction tradable water underlies the notion of wot upon which the scientific prediction of tradable water is the key to securing water resource safety of the transferor while promoting successful water trading rosegrant and binswanger 1994 zhang and zhang 2008 for the calculation of tradable water in irrigation areas factors such as agricultural water resource endowments and main water consumption i e the water used for crop growing must be considered specifically the water resource endowments in irrigation area primarily consist of water allocation atmospheric precipitation groundwater and river runoff etc while the water use for crop growing closely correlates with the regional land water allocation and agricultural planting structure li et al 2020a as a result driven by wot within a short time period when water saving technology can hardly be improved it is necessary to reduce the consumption of crop planting water as much as possible by optimizing planting structure in order to maximize the income of crop growing thereby increasing the tradable water and its utilization for wot in each irrigation area zhang et al 2016 therefore based on multi objective optimization theory in phase 1 an optimal allocation model for crop planting water driven by wot is established thereby calculating crop planting income and tradable water in irrigation areas within the period of water option contract 2 3 expected return analysis of wot when confronting with contracted water demand raised by water demander each irrigation area with heterogeneous resource endowments will conduct wot decision making according to the tradable water calculated in phase 1 the expected utility theory holds that decision makers choose between uncertain or risky prospects by comparing their expected utility values aumann 1962 given any choices each irrigation area will choose an alternative that has higher expected utility value under which circumstance phase 2 adopts the expected utility theory in analyzing diverse wot decision making scenarios and the corresponding expected returns in each irrigation area the decision making process of wot can further by subdivided into two steps in the first step the water demander proposes an option contract in option market on the basis of assessing its own water supply and demand in order to hedge the risks brought by water shortage and water price fluctuations in the second step the major water supplier irrigation area evaluates the expected wot return based on tradable water to make a wot decision 2 4 wotw calculation the decision making willingness of the subject is usually a gradual evolving process which is closely correlated with the subject s heterogeneous characteristics decision making interests and past experiences herbon 2016 huang 1998 teo and yu 2005 through establishing the forecast model of tradable water and the expected income model of wot the expected returns of crop planting and wot in irrigation area driven by wot are obtained respectively however these expected incomes contain a lot of uncertain hydrological and market information such as water endowments in irrigation areas inter annual variation of arable land in these areas fluctuating water prices in spot market and the actual water demands etc bontems and nauges 2019 sampson et al 2014 this undoubtedly increases the risk of wot affecting the wotw of irrigation areas therefore the decision makers usually refers to the past experiences or in advance predictions to facilitate the decision making of wot heterogeneous characteristics may affect individual behaviors dong 2007 sheremeta 2013 similarly in uncertain wot environment the capability of profiting and risk preventing of irrigation areas depends heavily on local resource endowments ranjan and shogren 2006 therefore heterogeneous irrigation areas will form different decision making responses based on the obtained forecast information which is largely reflected in the influences imposed by different water and arable land endowments on irrigation areas wotw to sum up with respect to water option contract each irrigation area should first assess the expected income according to the obtained forecast information to make wotw decision after which the willingness of conducting the next wot will be updated by the after action review that considers the actual information specifically the update of wotw in heterogeneous irrigation areas is based on previous willingness before it can be determined by comparing the trading income and the prediction accuracy delorit and block 2020 in brief the wotw of irrigation areas according to in advance prediction will increase only when the actual income of wot is greater than non trading income and the deviation between the actual and expected income of wot conducting in advance prediction is smaller than that of performing empirical prediction 3 modeling 3 1 prediction model of tradable water the tradable water can be calculated by 1 w tra t agr k w end t agr k w pla t agr k where t denotes the execution period of water option contract w tra t agr k denotes the tradable water measured in irrigation area k k 1 2 u w end t agr k denotes the agricultural water endowments in irrigation area k i e the sum of water allocation atmospheric precipitation groundwater and river runoff w pla t agr k denotes the water used for agricultural crop growing in irrigation area k due to the limited w end t agr k and motivated by wot benefits irrigation area will reduce the w pla t agr k while increasing the w tra t agr k by adjusting the crop growing structure on the premise of maximizing crop growing income therefore the multi objective optimal allocation model for crop growing water in irrigation areas within the contracted option period can be expressed as follows the objective function is written as 2 max r pla t agr k j 1 m i 1 n x ij a y i y e i m i n w pla t agr k j 1 m i 1 n n i x ij where r pla t agr k is the expected return of crop planting in irrigation area k within the contracted period t j j 1 2 m is the index of crop replanting times i i 1 2 n is the index of planted crop types x ij is the planting area of the crop i with j th replanting times x ij 0 suggests that the value of the replanting times of the crop i is less than j n i is the water demand per unit planting area of the crop i throughout its whole growing period furthermore a y i y e i is the conversion coefficient between planting area and yield yield and economic benefit of the crop i which can be used to determine the yield benefit of the crop i in period t constraint conditions 1 constraints of available arable land due to the scarce arable land the total crop planting areas including replanting must not exceed the total available planting area of arable land in the region during the contracted period a t total which can be described by 3 j 1 m i 1 n x ij a t total 2 constraints of available water driven by the option income the irrigation area have to reserve a certain amount of tradable water in order to participate in the wot suggesting that the water used for crop planting during contracted water option period must not exceed the area s water resource endowments which can be described by 4 j 1 m i 1 n n i x ij w end t agr k 3 constraints of crop demands considering food security within the contracted period t the planting area of crop i in irrigation area should be no lower than the minimum planting area specified for such crops p t i m i n which can be expressed by

solving the above equation 7 the optimal water resources allocation for various types of crops n i x ij and the tradable water w tra t agr k in irrigation areas are obtained however regarding the above model under the influence of complex hydrological and land use environments both w end t agr k and a t total exhibit strong uncertainty which therefore increases the difficulty in predicting w tra t agr k in order to compensate the negative impact of these factors on wot the decision maker shall proactively predict the uncertain information and evaluate the expected return in advance by relying on previous experiences and or adopting advanced technological countermeasures 3 2 the expected return model of wot the conventional process of wot is as follows step 1 the water demander proposes a call option contract c p 1 p 2 q t where p 1 is the exercise price of the water option i e the contract stipulates the price of buying the water right when the demander is short of water p 2 is the premium of unit water option i e the unit water option fee paid by the demander to the irrigation area to obtain the option q is the contracted water demand of the demander i e the total amount of water options the demander can buy from the irrigation area through the contract t is the exercise date of the water option measuring the expected return of wot when the contract expires step 2 the irrigation area evaluates the expected return of wot motivated by the option income if w tra t agr k q the irrigation area functioning as a rational economic man will sign an option contract with the water demander moreover the expected return of wot is affected by exercising the option contract to which the execution of the contract must meet two trigger conditions simultaneously one condition is that the spot market price of the water option p spot should be greater than the exercising price of the water option i e p spot p 1 the other is that the actual water demand of the demander w need non a g r must exist i e w need non a g r 0 only when both conditions are satisfied simultaneously can the water demander exercise the option contract in which situation the income of wot will include the contracted water purchasing income obtained from the demander note that both p spot and w need non a g r are characterized with uncertainties and can be regarded as continuous random variables in order to eliminate the uncertainties of these two variables this paper performs statistical analysis method to fit the probability distribution of the variables thereby obtaining their probability density functions based on existing data suppose the p spot follows the probability distribution p spot f p spot and its probability density is f p spot the w need non a g r follows the probability distribution w need non a g r f w need non a g r and its probability density is f w need non a g r based on the above steps the specific decision making scenarios and corresponding expected returns of wot are formulated as follows 1 if the predicted tradable water exceeds the contracted water demand i e when w tra t agr k q the irrigation area will enter into an option contract with the water demander facing four decision making scenarios scenario 1 if p spot p 1 the water demander will not exercise the option in this scenario the demander shall pay the total option premium q p 2 to the irrigation area furthermore the irrigation area will also receive the repurchase income of excess water p spot w tra t agr k suggesting that the administration purchases the excess water from the water supplier after the wot at market price in order to stimulate the wot to sum up the expected return function s 1 of the irrigation area in scenario 1 is expressed as 8 s 1 0 p 1 q p 2 p spot w tra t agr k f w need non a g r f p spot d w need non a g r d p spot scenario 2 if p spot p 1 but the demander is not really short of water i e w need non a g r 0 the demander will also not exercise the option similar to scenario 1 the water demander shall pay q p 2 to the irrigation area and the irrigation area will also receive p spot w tra t agr k to sum up the expected return function s 2 of the irrigation area in scenario 2 is expressed as 9 s 2 p 1 0 q p 2 p spot w tra t agr k f w need non a g r f p spot d w need non a g r d p spot scenario 3 if p spot p 1 and 0 w need non a g r q the demander will exercise part of the water option in this scenario the water demander shall pay both the option premium q p 2 and the water option purchasing fee w need non a g r p 1 to the irrigation area the irrigation area will also receive the repurchase income of excess water from the administration w tra t agr k w need non a g r p spot to sum up the expected return function s 3 of the irrigation area in scenario 3 is expressed as 10 s 3 p 1 0 q q p 2 w need non a g r p 1 w tra t agr k w need non a g r p spot f w need non a g r f p spot d w need non a g r d p spot scenario 4 if p spot p 1 and w need non a g r q the demander will exercise all the water options similar to scenario 3 the water demander shall pay q p 2 and q p 1 to the irrigation area the irrigation area will also receive the repurchasing income of excess water from the administration w tra t agr k q p spot to sum up the expected return function s 4 of the irrigation area in scenario 4 is expressed as 11 s 4 p 1 q q p 2 q p 1 w tra t agr k q p spot f w need non a g r f p spot d w need non a g r d p spot it can be seen from the above analysis that after the prediction of tradable water in phase 1 if w tra t agr k q the total expected income of wot in irrigation area is r wot r pla t agr k s where r pla t agr k denotes the crop planting income s s s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 denotes the wot income 2 when w tra t agr k q the irrigation area will consider whether to increase tradable water through adjusting the planting structure to satisfy the water demand contract if the irrigation area does not adjust the structure it may not be able to participate in the wot and can solely obtain the crop planting income r pla t agr k therefore if the irrigation area does not trade in water options the total expected income is r 1 r pla t agr k on the contrary if the area adjusts the planting structure it will obtain the adjusted crop planting income r tra t agr k a d j and the wot income s therefore if the irrigation area trades in water options by adjusting the planting structure the total expected income is r 2 r tra t agr k a d j s 3 3 calculation model of wotw this phase explores the change of wotw in irrigation areas with heterogeneous resource endowments considering the impact of interest and trust on willingness the dynamically evolving model of wotw is constructed according to the wot motivated incomes of crop planting and option trading obtained above which can be expressed as follows 12 wot w t wot w t 1 1 α u δ r wot emp δ r wot adv δ r wot emp δ r wot adv r wot act r n w o t act δ r wot emp δ r wot adv w o t w t 1 1 α d δ r wot emp δ r ws adv δ r wot emp δ r wot adv o t h e r w i s e in the above equation 12 wot w t denotes the wotw of the irrigation area in period t to which larger value of wot w t implies more inclination of the irrigation area to trade water options in period t similarly wot w t 1 is the wotw of the irrigation area in period t 1 which reflects the basic influence of the historical willingness on the wotw update α u α d is the sensitivity coefficient which expresses the increase decrease rate of wotw by setting the values of α u α d the variation characteristics of wotw can be reflected combining with actual situation the wotw is more sensitive to failed wot practices which means that the wotw will be reduced significantly if the actual benefits r wot act of conducting wot is less than those r n w o t act of not conducting wot or the deviation between the actual and the expected income of wot using in advance prediction δ r wot adv δ r wot adv 0 is larger than that of using empirical predication δ r wot emp δ r wot emp 0 one reasonable explanation is that on one hand wot cannot bring more benefits on the other hand the accuracy of in advance prediction is not satisfactory or even worse than empirical prediction so the irrigation area s trust in prediction is reduced conversely reaching a high level of wotw requires continuous accumulation of some successful wot practices i e r wot act r n w o t act and δ r wot emp δ r wot adv it is easy to prove that δ r wot emp δ r wot adv δ r wot emp δ r wot adv 1 1 especially when δ r wot emp δ r wot adv 0 then δ r wot emp δ r wot adv δ r wot emp δ r wot adv 0 1 this suggests that when the accuracy of in advance predictions is better than that of empirical ones the willingness of irrigation areas to conduct wot based on in advance prediction information will increase on the contrary when δ r wot emp δ r wot adv 0 then δ r wot emp δ r wot adv δ r wot emp δ r wot adv 1 0 which will inhibit the wotw of the irrigation area 4 case study the proposed model was applied in the bayannur with typical irrigation areas to which the corresponding results are illustrated as follows 4 1 study site the bayannur locating in the west of the inner monggol autonomous region and north of the yellow river is one of the three largest irrigation areas in china the areas stretches across five districts counties in bayannur including linhe lh dengkou dk hanggin rear banner hb wuyuan wy and urad banner ub covering an area of 65000 km2 with 803 565 ha farmland and a population of 1 728 559 in 2020 the reasonable for choosing the bayannur as the case study are presented as follows 1 water demanders are short of water as the economy develops the water demand of various industries in bayannur is emerging for which reason the initial allocation of water resources cannot satisfy the needs of regional development 2 agricultural has the water saving potential bayannur has been developing its irrigated agriculture which relies largely on the yellow river to grow wheat corn sunflower melon and other crops in this region although agriculture accounts for 87 of its total water consumption however the effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water is less than 0 4 and the gross agricultural production accounts for only 46 of the total local revenue 2018 data 3 policy support bayannur has been listed as a pilot area for water rights trading by china s ministry of water resources which puts forward new requirements for regional development on one hand as an important commodity grain production base securing regional food safety is of utmost importance on the other hand it is of critical necessity to develop water saving agriculture while facilitating the conversion of agricultural water to non agricultural water by activating marketplace for water options trading 4 to facilitate studying the five regions counties in bayannur are geographically adjacent and have similar planting preferences hydrological and market environment which helps control the variables to analyze the impact of heterogeneous water and land resource endowments on wotw in each region county 4 2 data collection this paper designs three types of dataset namely the actual data the empirical prediction data and the in advance prediction data the first one refers to the real data from 2011 to 2020 obtained from authoritative documents and reports such as inner mongolia statistical yearbook bayannur water resources bulletin and main crop water requirement and irrigation of china the second one means that the predicted data is obtained by calculating the average value of the actual data in the previous five years for example the data of 2014 is predicted by calculating the average value of the actual data from 2009 to 2013 the last one means that the data is obtained by adopting some advanced prediction methods based on the empirical data in this paper the grey model is used for predicting w tra t agr k and a t total while the probability statistics are for p spot and w need non a g r respectively the sources and corresponding relationships of the three external datasets are shown in fig 2 specifically in phase 1 of the above fig 2 the actual data of water arable land resource and main crop data of each irrigation area are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively in phase 2 the water option contract is c 3 5 0 1 q 1 based on the reality where q is the analysis variable being used to discuss the evolution of wotw in irrigation areas when facing different contracted water demands in addition combining with historical data the fitting results suggest that both the probability distribution of p spot and w need non a g r approximate gauss distribution where p spot n 4 1 0 252 w need non a g r n 19597537 12749572 in phase 3 it is assumed that the initial wotw of each irrigation area is 0 5 considering that the rate of decrease in willingness is higher than that of increase so set α u 0 4 α d 0 6 4 3 results and discussion 4 3 1 comparative analysis of resource endowments in each irrigation area 1 actual data in order to investigate the influence of resource heterogeneity in irrigation areas on the wotw this part compares the endowments of water and arable land in each irrigation area based on actual data 2009 2020 as shown in fig 3 a 3 b and 3 c in general the five irrigated areas exhibit distinctive differences in terms of the endowments of arable land and water resources per unit of arable land specifically the sequencing of arable land resource endowments satisfies ub wy lh hb dk the sequencing of water resource endowments satisfies ub lh wy hb dk the sequencing of water resource endowments per unit of arable land satisfies hb dk lh wy ub moreover the concentration of the data in the figure reflects the inter annual variation of endowments to which more concentrated data implies smaller inter annual variation in endowments according to the above results the resource endowments of each irrigation area are further subdivided into three subgroups high h medium m and low l to which the corresponding sequencing of the subdivision results is presented as follows arable land resource endowments h ub m wy lh l hb dk water resource endowments h ub m lh wy hb l dk water resource endowments per unit of arable land h hb dk m lh wy l ub which is shown in fig 4 the links in the figure represent the relevance and the results suggest that except for wy and lh the matching between arable land and water resources in other irrigation areas is not balanced for example the water resource endowments of the area ub may be lower than the water demand of its arable land on the contrary the water resource endowments of the areas dk and hb may exceed the water demand of their arable land 2 prediction data as aforementioned this study designs three types of comparative datasets the resource endowments of each irrigation area 2014 2020 are predicted based on the method of empirical and in advanced predictions after which the mean with standard deviation sd results of the three datasets are compared as shown in fig 5 the results suggest that these two prediction methods can effectively predict the water and arable land resource endowments in irrigation areas among which the results of in advance prediction are generally better than those of empirical prediction particularly the in advance prediction exhibits significant advantages when the inter annual variation of arable land resource endowments in irrigation areas is large such as ub dk or when that of water resource endowments is large such as ub 4 3 2 evolutionary analysis of wotw in order to investigate the evolution of wotw based on prediction information in heterogeneous irrigation areas four scenarios of contracted water demand are designed to simulate the scarcity of tradable water i e 5 10 15 and 20 the differentiated design of contractual demand scenarios enhances the applicability of this framework specifically 5 means that the contracted water demand exceeds 5 of the tradable water predicted by the irrigation area i e q 1 5 w tra t agr k which can also be interpreted as the water deficient ratio in the irrigation area planning to trade water option and the same implications apply for the contracted water demands of 10 15 20 then based on the willingness calculation model the evolution of the wotw from 2014 to 2020 in the five irrigation areas is analyzed to which the results are shown in fig 6 with respect to the evolving trend of wotw it can be observed from fig 6 that all the evolving wotw in irrigation areas lh dk and hb exhibit a general upward trend which can be attributed to two aspects on one hand in recent years the water endowments of each irrigation area has shown an increasing trend year by year which can increase the amount of tradable water in irrigation areas on the other hand the prediction information has proven to be reliable which is conducive to reducing the risk of wot however the evolution of wotw in irrigation areas wy and ub fluctuated markedly which attributes to the fact that wy and ub have less water resource endowments per unit of arable land this further weakens their risk prevention ability of wot to hedge against uncertainties leaving them vulnerable to volatility in water option returns considering contracted water demand in each irrigation area fig 6 a and 6 d suggest that when the contracted water demand varies from 10 to 15 the wotw in both areas of lh and wy are relatively large furthermore neither too high 20 nor too low 5 contracted water demand is capable of stimulating the wotw of lh and wy the reason is that the water and arable land resources are relatively matched and their inter annual variation is small in lh and wy in this case only can a modest contracted water demand motivate lh and wy to participate in wot fig 6 b shows that within the variation range from 5 to 20 of the contracted water demand no significant difference can be found in the wotw of the irrigation area dk and even in the later period 2019 2020 the evolution of the wotw stagnates in dk the above phenomenon attributes to the large endowments and inter annual variation of water resource per unit of arable land in dk which enhances the adaptability of the irrigation area to small scale fluctuations in water demand in this case further evolution of wotw may require higher water demands as shown in fig 6 c within the variation range of the contracted water demand from 5 to 20 the wotw in the hb area increases with the increase in contracted water demand one reasonable explanation for the above phenomenon is the abundant endowments and small inter annual variation of water resource per unit of arable land in hb which undoubtedly increases the tradable water and the ability to hedge the risk of wot in hb undersuchcircumstance motivated by wot benefits hb is more inclined to sign a water option contract with a larger water demand fig 6 e shows that the wotw of ub increases steadily as the contracted water demand increases from 5 to 15 however when the contracted water demand increases to 20 a sharp drop occurs in wotw which can be attributed to the smaller endowments and inter annual variation of water resource per unit of arable land in ub therefore ub is more inclined to sign a water option contract with a relatively stable water demand once the contract water demand exceeds a certain threshold the wotw of ub will decrease in conclusion when the water and arable land resources are relatively matched and their inter annual variation is small the irrigation area is more inclined to sign a water option contract with a modest water demand when the water and arable land resources are relatively large and their inter annual variation is small the irrigation area is more inclined to sign a water option contract with a larger water demand when the water and arable land resources are relatively small and their inter annual variation is larger a relatively stable water option contract should be designed for the irrigation area 4 3 3 intensity analysis of wotw in this subsection the influences of different resource endowments and contracted water demand imposed on the intensity of wotw in irrigation areas are analyzed which is shown in fig 7 and fig 8 fig 7 shows the mean value of the wotw in different irrigation areas under different contracted water demands from 2014 to 2020 the results suggest that the intensity of wotw in these five heterogeneous irrigation areas varies considerably and satisfies the following sequencing result hb lh dk ub wy similarly according to the above results it is further subdivided into three subgroups h hb m lh dk l ub wy fig 8 analyzes the relevance between the intensity of wotw in irrigation areas and that between water resource endowments per unit of arable land and its inter annual variation the results suggest that the intensity of wotw in irrigation areas is determined by water resource endowment per unit of arable land and is affected by the inter annual fluctuation of water resource endowment per unit of arable land to some extent in other words greater water resource endowment per unit of arable land indicates greater wotw of irrigation areas larger inter annual variation of the water resource endowment per unit of arable land implies more inclination of weakening the intensity of wotw in irrigation areas for example among those areas hb possesses the largest water resource endowment per unit of arable land and the smallest inter annual variation of water resource endowment per unit of arable land in this case hb has the greatest intensity of wotw remarkably despite the water resource endowment per unit of arable land in dk wy is greater than that in lh ub the final sequencing result of wotw intensity is dk lh wy ub which can be attributed to the greater inter annual variation of the water resource endowment per unit of arable land in dk wy than that of lh ub in addition by comparing dk and ub it can be found that the inter annual variation of the water resource endowment per unit of arable land exerts a rather limited influence on the intensity of wotw whereas the water resource endowment per unit of arable land plays a decisive role in wotw intensity of irrigation areas the causes for the above results owe to the following reasons one reason is that larger water resource endowment per unit of arable land is more conducive to realize trade off between crop planting and wot additionally rich water resource endowments also help the irrigation area hedge against the risk of wot brought by the complex hydrological and market environments the other explanation is that if large inter annual variation of the water resources endowment per unit of arable land happens the water and arable land resource of the irrigation area becomes considerably complex which will inevitably increase the difficulty of scientific prediction on resource endowments in this scenario the irrigation area is prone to conduct irrational wot decisions under which circumstance the deviation between the expected income and the actual income will decrease the wotw of the irrigation area in the next round of wot fig 9 shows the mean value of wotw in different irrigation areas with different contracted water demand the results suggest that the wotw intensity of irrigation areas with heterogeneous resource endowments has different response mechanisms to cope with different contracted water demand for instance lh and hb in particular are sensitive to the change of contracted water demand the percentages of 10 5 20 10 and 15 are the optimal contracted water demand to stimulate the wotw intensity in lh dk hb wy and ub respectively fig 10 shows the matching relationship between the optimal contracted water demand and the irrigation areas with different inter annual deviation of water resource endowment per unit of arable land the results suggest that larger inter annual variation of water resource endowment per unit of arable land implies smaller optimal contracted water demand which can be explained as follows large inter annual variation of the water resource endowment per unit of arable land will increase the profitable risks in wot in order to hedge risks irrigation areas are inclined to participate in water options trading with smaller contractual water demand fig 11 shows the intensity of wotw under different resource endowment and contracted water demand scenarios for example if the contracted water demand is 20 the total wotw intensity in the five irrigation areas is 25 suggesting that the total wotw intensity in these areas reaches its maximum and minimum when the contracted water demand is 10 and 5 respectively as the contracted water demand increases from 10 to 20 the total wotw intensity in these areas gradually decreases in view of the above analysis when only one water demand contract can be designed 10 is the optimal contracted water demand which can make the intensity of wotw of these five irrigation districts reach the maximum value 4 3 4 potential analysis of improving wotw the potential for improving wotw is closely correlated with the irrigation areas resource endowments and external incentives therefore this potential can be reflected to some degree through analyzing the distribution range of the wotw in heterogeneous irrigation areas in different planning years and contracted water demand if the wotw distribution is relatively concentrated it indicates that the wotw in irrigation areas is less affected by the inter annual variation of resource endowments and different contracted water demand scenarios which limits the potential for improving the wotw in irrigation areas whereas relatively scattered distribution of the wotw suggests the opposite result fig 12 shows the wotw distribution in these five irrigation areas from 2014 to 2020 in four contracted water demand scenarios according to the result the wotw distribution in the areas of hb lh and dk are relatively scattered whereas the wotw distribution in wy and ub are relatively concentrated the sequencing result of the potential for improving the wotw in these five areas is hb lh dk ub wy similarly according to the above results these areas are further subdivided into three subgroups h hb m lh dk l ub wy in terms of the wotw distribution scope the wotw distribution in the areas of lh hb and ub is mainly concentrated in the end of the scope i e the end has the highest wotw density suggesting great potential in improving the wotw particularly the wotw in the end of the scope the wotw distribution in dk is concentrated at both ends and the middle of the distribution scope in particular since the wotw in the middle is usually not stable enough and susceptible to external factors it should be promoted first in addition the wotw in wy is concentrated at the top of the scope suggesting limited potential in improving the wotw fig 13 shows the relevance between the wotw intensity and the potential in improving the wotw of each area suggesting that larger wotw intensity indicates greater potential in improving the wotw the above results reveal that the potential for improving wotw has the characteristics of the matthew effect i e the improve potential is determined by the resource endowments of the irrigation area and is affected by certain external incentives such as optimal contract water demand fig 14 shows the wotw distribution in these five irrigation areas under different contracted water demand scenarios it can be observed that when the contracted water demand is 10 5 20 5 and 15 respectively the wotw distribution range of the irrigation areas of lh dk hb wy and ub is the widest having the greatest potential in improving the wotw in these five areas the above results suggest that when the contracted water demand scenario satisfies the optimal contracted water demand of each irrigation area the potential for improving the wotw of each area is the largest 5 conclusions this study focuses on exploring the influence of water and arable land heterogeneity in irrigation areas on their sole discretion to trade water options proposing improvement measures to facilitate wot under uncertain hydrological and market environments through integrating multi objective optimization with expected utility theory the optimal allocation of crop planting water and expected returns in heterogeneous irrigation areas motivated by wot are analyzed and the model that measures the wotw in the areas using prediction information is proposed the case study of bayannur adopts the proposed model the conclusions and managerial insights of this paper are formulated as follows a mian conclusions 1 instead of affected by the amount of a single resource endowment the wotw is largely affected by the matching equilibrium of water and arable land resources in irrigation areas 2 smaller water resource endowment per unit of arable land in the irrigation area implies larger fluctuation of the wotw evolution increasing the amount of tradable water and the accuracy of prediction information is conducive to the upward evolving of wotw 3 greater water resource endowment per unit of arable land suggests stronger wotw of irrigated areas furthermore larger inter annual variation of the water resource endowment per unit of arable land indicates more inclination of the wotw intensity in irrigated areas to be weakened and more inclination of the irrigation area participating in wot with smaller contractual water demand 4 the potential for improving wotw is consistent with the wotw intensity in irrigation areas to some extent which suggests that greater wotw intensity in irrigation areas implies more potential for improving wotw b managerial insights 1 the influence mechanism of water and arable land endowments on the wotw should be analyzed from comprehensive perspective of water resource endowment per unit of arable land and the wotw in irrigation areas can be maximized by coordinating the allocation of water and arable land resources 2 the steady wotw evolution in irrigation areas can be achieved by not only increasing the water resource endowment per unit of arable land but applying scientific prediction methodologies in particular increasing the water resource endowment per unit of arable land mainly involves two approaches under the condition of constant arable land resources one approach is to increase the water resource endowments in irrigation areas by increasing the allocation of water resources and reducing the water consumption for crop planting under the condition of constant water resources the other approach is to reduce the demand for arable land resources in irrigation areas by optimizing agricultural planting structure or by developing high yield high quality and high efficiency agriculture 3 the wotw intensity in irrigation areas is determined by the water resource endowment per unit of arable land and is affected by the inter annual fluctuation of water resource endowment per unit of arable land to some extent therefore balancing the inter annual allocation of water and arable land resources in irrigation areas is beneficial to increasing the wotw in irrigation areas moreover for irrigation areas with large inter annual variation in water endowment per unit of arable land smaller contractual water demand is more likely to motivate them to participate in wot 4 in terms of the potential for improving wotw of contracted water demand when the conditions of appropriate water resource endowment per unit of arable land and its small inter annual variation are satisfied contract with moderate water demand has the greatest potential for improving the wotw when the water resource endowment per unit of arable land and its inter annual variation is large the amount of contracted water demand has little potential for improving the wotw when the water resource endowment per unit of arable land is small and its inter annual variation is large contract with appropriate water demand has the great potential for improving the wotw in this study although the research framework has comprehensively considered the conventional mechanism of wot its application may be limited by several countries that are hydrologically or statutorily dissimilar our future researching interest will be focusing on these factors enabling this study to be applied to a wider community credit authorship

2876,water options trading wot is an effective way to promote efficient allocation of water resources and to manage risks of water scarcity scientific prediction information can help hedge the risks brought by uncertain hydrological and market environment to wot however confronting with the prediction information irrigation areas characterizing with heterogeneous resource endowments often exhibit different willingness in wot therefore through using prediction information this study provides a novel perspective to assess the water option trading willingness wotw in irrigation areas with heterogeneous resource endowments firstly according to multi objective optimization and expected utility theory a three phase dynamic adjustment model involving tradable water prediction expected return analysis of wot and wotw calculation is constructed and integrated then based on three sets of comparative analysis data from 2014 to 2020 in five irrigated areas the influence mechanism of heterogeneous resource endowments on the evolution intensity and improvement potential of the wotw is analyzed and the option contract with optimal water demand to motivate the wotw in heterogeneous irrigation areas is proposed the results of the case study suggest that the wotw is largely affected by the matching equilibrium of water and arable land resources in irrigation areas larger water resource endowment per unit of arable land indicates smaller fluctuation of the wotw evolution and greater intensity and improvement potential of the wotw conversely larger inter annual variation of the water resource endowment per unit of arable land implies more inclination of the wotw intensity in irrigation areas to be weakened in which situation the irrigation areas prefer the option contracts with less water demand this study provides a new method and theoretical foundation for the optimal allocation and options trading of agricultural water resources keywords water option options trading willingness irrigated area heterogeneous resources endowments prediction information data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the crisis of water scarcity has been mushrooming in some developing and less developed regions worldwide which not only limits their economic development but also prevents the living standard of people who inhabit in these regions from being improved elevating the utilization of water resources therefore becomes the most crucial and urgent problem to be solved in order to realize sustainable development for countries and regions suffering with water crisis around the world tan and zhang 2018 in recent years the exercise of market economy and free competition enables trading water rights trading on the premise of water conservation transferring water resources from low efficiency regions to high efficiency ones under which circumstance water consumption intensive industries and consumers are being pushed in the teeth of the storm svensson et al 2021 womble and hanemann 2020 it has reached a consensus that the distinctive feature of agriculture characterizes with high water consumption yet relatively low water utilization efficiency for instance the available water resources consumed by agriculture accounts for more than 60 percent of the total water consumption in china whereas the effective water utilization rate remains merely 45 wei et al 2016 in this severe situation one of the effective countermeasures to balance water supply with water demand is to vigorously develop water saving agriculture while promoting the transmission of agricultural water to non agricultural water arellano gonzalez et al 2021 fang and zhang 2020 for this exploring the optimal allocation and rights trading of agricultural water resources has become an important issue applying traditional trading mechanism which lacks flexibility to water options is rendered less possible to neutralize the risks caused by the uncertainty of water supply and fluctuating water prices to hedge risks the idea of water options is proposed which gives potential traders permission to negotiate on water transaction price and volume offering contract holders the rights to buy or sell a certain amount of water at an agreed price during the contract period hansen et al 2014 rey et al 2016a comparing with other means of water trading such as spot market transaction water bank virtual water the water option contract is more flexible and reliable owing to the ever increasing popularity of water options in the research field of water management the water option trade wot exhibits great potential in various practical applications conrad and lópez 2002 delorit and block 2020 yan et al 2018 the irrigated area is the relatively independent management unit of agricultural planting which is usually in the position of water right transferor regulating water rights and water diversion as well as transmission and distribution system of the planting area however the market price of water trade still remains somehow uncertain which attributes to various influencing factors involving but not limited to complicated hydrological and market environment the information on tradable water of irrigated areas the water demand of transferee etc li et al 2014 therefore the premise of participating in wot is to adopt scientific methodology to guarantee accurate prediction thereby realizing effective coupling of forecast information and water option contract delorit et al 2019 wu et al 2021 moreover since the capability in risk prevention and profiting underlies the attitude of irrigation area toward the forecast information their water option trading willingness wotw is therefore affected by the attitude that closely correlates with the area s resource endowment delorit and block 2020 heterogeneity is a notion that describes the characteristic differences among objects although some studies assumed that individuals in economic activities are homogeneous and can be regarded as fundamental economic elements that are mutually replaceable however in reality this assumption fails to elaborate profound and volatile decision making behavior of individuals to which comprehensive analysis shall initiate from individual and or group heterogeneity perspectives instead huang et al 2020 tan et al 2020 therefore in order to activate the marketplace for trading agricultural water rights while improving water utilization efficiency it is of significant necessity to analyze the influence mechanism of heterogeneous resource endowments in irrigation areas on their wotw and to determine the optimal water option contracts maximizing the wotw willingness can be understood as the preference and intention that an individual is inclined to do something which is usually based on interests and trust liu et al 2019 scholz et al 2015 some studies measured and analyzed individual willingness in water resource utilization and management through modeling and empirical approaches contingent valuation method and binary profit model were used to assess farmers willingness to use treated wastewater deh haghi et al 2020 iftekhar et al 2021 wang et al 2017 proposed a two level multi objective planning model to obtain the optimal allocation of agricultural water resources and the transaction price of water options stimulating the willingness to save water in irrigation areas conrad et al 2017 conducted a discrete choice experiment to investigate farmers preference concerning water use policies such as water rights allocation and water rights trading during drought periods the study on wotw and its influencing mechanism is conductive to analyzing the internal driving force of trading behavior and to realizing the efficient transfer of water rights unfortunately few studies have discussed how to optimize the water consumption structure of irrigation areas to participate in wot when the tradable water is insufficient and the influence of the heterogeneous resource endowment of irrigation areas on their willingness to trade water options the existing researches on water option basically concentrate on its trading and pricing mechanisms hu et al 2021a ramos and garrido 2004 rey et al 2016b seidl et al 2020 conduct a quantitative survey of the water market in the murray darling basin which suggested that financial investors and large corporates are more likely to offer highly sophisticated temporary water trading products similar to water options vicuna et al 2018 discussed the optimal option trading mechanism for agricultural water during droughts and short term turbidity events in santiago a risk hedging model was applied to wot by yan et al 2018 providing the optimal trading strategy for water consumers ha and gao 2017 constructed an imprecise two stage mixed integer programming model to study the case of wot a pricing model for water option was proposed by cui and schreider 2009 to activate the australian water market according to the rationale of stochastic process with jumps however considering the trading and pricing mechanisms the expected return of wot with insufficient tradable water needs further investigation in order to eliminate uncertainties in wot accurate forecasting information and methods that can hedge risks in the trading were proposed wei and xie 2022 among them the grey model was proposed by deng 1982 exhibiting characteristics of small sample but high prediction accuracy which has been widely applied in various fields to predict population water consumption industrial output etc hu et al 2021b meng et al 2021 stochastic programming and the characterization of uncertain factors based on probability distribution are also effective methods li et al 2020b applied bayesian theorem to develop a forecasting model for tradable water and the probability distribution function pdf of water demand womble and hanemann 2020 assessed the transaction costs of water options by analyzing the pdf of collected procedural transaction costs zhang et al 2018 developed a double sided stochastic chance constrained linear fractional programming model to analyze the consumption of irrigation water under uncertainties based on maximum entropy model and probability distribution theory yan et al 2018 effectively predicted the runoff and spot market prices in wot as mentioned above individual preferences and behaviors are influenced by heterogeneous characteristics in the field of wot some scholars explored the influence of individual heterogeneity imposed on participant s decision making based on panel data fang and wu 2020 analyzed the performance of wot in irrigation areas with heterogeneous water pressure by constructing time varying did model wang et al 2022 developed the bltsfppb model by integrating bi level programming and bayesian model and explored the optimal allocation of water resources considering the subjectivity of water managers driven by water options trading delorit and block 2020 explored the influence of farmers heterogeneous risk attitudes on their water options investment and cooperation willingness in wot the tradable water involved in wot is determined by water resources endowment and crop planting composition within an irrigation area therefore the heterogeneity in arable land and in water resource endowments of irrigation areas must be considered in analyzing wotw nevertheless hardly can sufficient studies be found which propose specific research framework to explore the influence of heterogeneous resource endowments on the wotw in irrigation areas in response to the above problem this study aims at analyzing the influence of heterogeneous resource endowments imposed on the willingness of irrigation areas to participate in wot by optimizing their water consumption structure proposing the option contract with optimal water demand to activate the wotw in heterogeneous irrigation areas by coupling the multi objective optimal allocation model for crop planting water with the expected return and willingness calculation model of wot the novelty and contributions of this study are elaborated as follows 1 by coupling an multi objective optimal allocation model for crop planting water a model that calculates the expected return and willingness of wot is established providing a novel perspective with forecast information to assess the wotw in irrigation areas characterized with heterogeneous resource endowments 2 an interest trust motivated model that can dynamically update the wotw is proposed thereby enabling the model itself to accurately describe the evolution of wotw in irrigation areas with heterogeneous resource endowments after action review 3 four scenarios of contracted water demand are designed to stimulate the wotw in irrigation areas with heterogeneous endowments making breakthroughs in practical scale limitations of the proposed model in conclusion driven by wot this study provides insights into the optimal allocation of water resources in irrigation areas with heterogeneous resource endowments and the increase in wotw which is conducive to the efficient utilization of agricultural water resources the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 outlines the corresponding problem descriptions section 3 elaborates the detailed modelling process of our proposal consisting of tradable water prediction expected return analysis of wot and wotw calculation section 4 applies the developed model to bayannur section 5 summarizes the conclusions and future works of this paper 2 problem description 2 1 overview of the problem this study aims at exploring the influence mechanism of resource endowments of heterogeneous water and arable land on the wotw in irrigation areas advancing sound and reasonable suggestions for improving wot in irrigation areas with different resource endowments under the environment with uncertain risk where decision making is required by integrating three dynamic adjustment phases involving tradable water forecast expected return analysis of wot including the expected return of adjusting the planting structure and wotw calculation this study provides a novel perspective for assessing the wotw in irrigation areas with heterogeneous endowments to which the specific procedures are outlined as follows in phase 1 an optimal multi objective model is established to predict the tradable water and expected planting return in different irrigation areas in phase 2 the income scenarios of wot under uncertainties are analyzed according to the expected utility theory in phase 3 an interest trust motivated model is proposed to describe the evolution of wotw in irrigation areas to which the schematic diagram demonstrating the flow of the proposed framework is depicted in fig 1 2 2 tradable water prediction tradable water underlies the notion of wot upon which the scientific prediction of tradable water is the key to securing water resource safety of the transferor while promoting successful water trading rosegrant and binswanger 1994 zhang and zhang 2008 for the calculation of tradable water in irrigation areas factors such as agricultural water resource endowments and main water consumption i e the water used for crop growing must be considered specifically the water resource endowments in irrigation area primarily consist of water allocation atmospheric precipitation groundwater and river runoff etc while the water use for crop growing closely correlates with the regional land water allocation and agricultural planting structure li et al 2020a as a result driven by wot within a short time period when water saving technology can hardly be improved it is necessary to reduce the consumption of crop planting water as much as possible by optimizing planting structure in order to maximize the income of crop growing thereby increasing the tradable water and its utilization for wot in each irrigation area zhang et al 2016 therefore based on multi objective optimization theory in phase 1 an optimal allocation model for crop planting water driven by wot is established thereby calculating crop planting income and tradable water in irrigation areas within the period of water option contract 2 3 expected return analysis of wot when confronting with contracted water demand raised by water demander each irrigation area with heterogeneous resource endowments will conduct wot decision making according to the tradable water calculated in phase 1 the expected utility theory holds that decision makers choose between uncertain or risky prospects by comparing their expected utility values aumann 1962 given any choices each irrigation area will choose an alternative that has higher expected utility value under which circumstance phase 2 adopts the expected utility theory in analyzing diverse wot decision making scenarios and the corresponding expected returns in each irrigation area the decision making process of wot can further by subdivided into two steps in the first step the water demander proposes an option contract in option market on the basis of assessing its own water supply and demand in order to hedge the risks brought by water shortage and water price fluctuations in the second step the major water supplier irrigation area evaluates the expected wot return based on tradable water to make a wot decision 2 4 wotw calculation the decision making willingness of the subject is usually a gradual evolving process which is closely correlated with the subject s heterogeneous characteristics decision making interests and past experiences herbon 2016 huang 1998 teo and yu 2005 through establishing the forecast model of tradable water and the expected income model of wot the expected returns of crop planting and wot in irrigation area driven by wot are obtained respectively however these expected incomes contain a lot of uncertain hydrological and market information such as water endowments in irrigation areas inter annual variation of arable land in these areas fluctuating water prices in spot market and the actual water demands etc bontems and nauges 2019 sampson et al 2014 this undoubtedly increases the risk of wot affecting the wotw of irrigation areas therefore the decision makers usually refers to the past experiences or in advance predictions to facilitate the decision making of wot heterogeneous characteristics may affect individual behaviors dong 2007 sheremeta 2013 similarly in uncertain wot environment the capability of profiting and risk preventing of irrigation areas depends heavily on local resource endowments ranjan and shogren 2006 therefore heterogeneous irrigation areas will form different decision making responses based on the obtained forecast information which is largely reflected in the influences imposed by different water and arable land endowments on irrigation areas wotw to sum up with respect to water option contract each irrigation area should first assess the expected income according to the obtained forecast information to make wotw decision after which the willingness of conducting the next wot will be updated by the after action review that considers the actual information specifically the update of wotw in heterogeneous irrigation areas is based on previous willingness before it can be determined by comparing the trading income and the prediction accuracy delorit and block 2020 in brief the wotw of irrigation areas according to in advance prediction will increase only when the actual income of wot is greater than non trading income and the deviation between the actual and expected income of wot conducting in advance prediction is smaller than that of performing empirical prediction 3 modeling 3 1 prediction model of tradable water the tradable water can be calculated by 1 w tra t agr k w end t agr k w pla t agr k where t denotes the execution period of water option contract w tra t agr k denotes the tradable water measured in irrigation area k k 1 2 u w end t agr k denotes the agricultural water endowments in irrigation area k i e the sum of water allocation atmospheric precipitation groundwater and river runoff w pla t agr k denotes the water used for agricultural crop growing in irrigation area k due to the limited w end t agr k and motivated by wot benefits irrigation area will reduce the w pla t agr k while increasing the w tra t agr k by adjusting the crop growing structure on the premise of maximizing crop growing income therefore the multi objective optimal allocation model for crop growing water in irrigation areas within the contracted option period can be expressed as follows the objective function is written as 2 max r pla t agr k j 1 m i 1 n x ij a y i y e i m i n w pla t agr k j 1 m i 1 n n i x ij where r pla t agr k is the expected return of crop planting in irrigation area k within the contracted period t j j 1 2 m is the index of crop replanting times i i 1 2 n is the index of planted crop types x ij is the planting area of the crop i with j th replanting times x ij 0 suggests that the value of the replanting times of the crop i is less than j n i is the water demand per unit planting area of the crop i throughout its whole growing period furthermore a y i y e i is the conversion coefficient between planting area and yield yield and economic benefit of the crop i which can be used to determine the yield benefit of the crop i in period t constraint conditions 1 constraints of available arable land due to the scarce arable land the total crop planting areas including replanting must not exceed the total available planting area of arable land in the region during the contracted period a t total which can be described by 3 j 1 m i 1 n x ij a t total 2 constraints of available water driven by the option income the irrigation area have to reserve a certain amount of tradable water in order to participate in the wot suggesting that the water used for crop planting during contracted water option period must not exceed the area s water resource endowments which can be described by 4 j 1 m i 1 n n i x ij w end t agr k 3 constraints of crop demands considering food security within the contracted period t the planting area of crop i in irrigation area should be no lower than the minimum planting area specified for such crops p t i m i n which can be expressed by 5 j 1 m x ij p t i m i n 4 non negative constraints when the number of replanting crops is j the planting area of the crop i should be no less than 0 which is described as 6 x ij 0 by integrating the objective function with constraints the global model to achieve minimum crop water consumption with an acceptable level of crop economic benefit is expressed as follows max r pla t agr k j 1 m i 1 n x ij a y i y e i m i n w pla t agr k j 1 m i 1 n n i x ij 7 s t j 1 m i 1 n n i x ij w end t agr k j 1 m i 1 n x ij a t total j 1 m x ij p t i m i n x ij 0 w tra t agr k w end t agr k w pla t agr k by solving the above equation 7 the optimal water resources allocation for various types of crops n i x ij and the tradable water w tra t agr k in irrigation areas are obtained however regarding the above model under the influence of complex hydrological and land use environments both w end t agr k and a t total exhibit strong uncertainty which therefore increases the difficulty in predicting w tra t agr k in order to compensate the negative impact of these factors on wot the decision maker shall proactively predict the uncertain information and evaluate the expected return in advance by relying on previous experiences and or adopting advanced technological countermeasures 3 2 the expected return model of wot the conventional process of wot is as follows step 1 the water demander proposes a call option contract c p 1 p 2 q t where p 1 is the exercise price of the water option i e the contract stipulates the price of buying the water right when the demander is short of water p 2 is the premium of unit water option i e the unit water option fee paid by the demander to the irrigation area to obtain the option q is the contracted water demand of the demander i e the total amount of water options the demander can buy from the irrigation area through the contract t is the exercise date of the water option measuring the expected return of wot when the contract expires step 2 the irrigation area evaluates the expected return of wot motivated by the option income if w tra t agr k q the irrigation area functioning as a rational economic man will sign an option contract with the water demander moreover the expected return of wot is affected by exercising the option contract to which the execution of the contract must meet two trigger conditions simultaneously one condition is that the spot market price of the water option p spot should be greater than the exercising price of the water option i e p spot p 1 the other is that the actual water demand of the demander w need non a g r must exist i e w need non a g r 0 only when both conditions are satisfied simultaneously can the water demander exercise the option contract in which situation the income of wot will include the contracted water purchasing income obtained from the demander note that both p spot and w need non a g r are characterized with uncertainties and can be regarded as continuous random variables in order to eliminate the uncertainties of these two variables this paper performs statistical analysis method to fit the probability distribution of the variables thereby obtaining their probability density functions based on existing data suppose the p spot follows the probability distribution p spot f p spot and its probability density is f p spot the w need non a g r follows the probability distribution w need non a g r f w need non a g r and its probability density is f w need non a g r based on the above steps the specific decision making scenarios and corresponding expected returns of wot are formulated as follows 1 if the predicted tradable water exceeds the contracted water demand i e when w tra t agr k q the irrigation area will enter into an option contract with the water demander facing four decision making scenarios scenario 1 if p spot p 1 the water demander will not exercise the option in this scenario the demander shall pay the total option premium q p 2 to the irrigation area furthermore the irrigation area will also receive the repurchase income of excess water p spot w tra t agr k suggesting that the administration purchases the excess water from the water supplier after the wot at market price in order to stimulate the wot to sum up the expected return function s 1 of the irrigation area in scenario 1 is expressed as 8 s 1 0 p 1 q p 2 p spot w tra t agr k f w need non a g r f p spot d w need non a g r d p spot scenario 2 if p spot p 1 but the demander is not really short of water i e w need non a g r 0 the demander will also not exercise the option similar to scenario 1 the water demander shall pay q p 2 to the irrigation area and the irrigation area will also receive p spot w tra t agr k to sum up the expected return function s 2 of the irrigation area in scenario 2 is expressed as 9 s 2 p 1 0 q p 2 p spot w tra t agr k f w need non a g r f p spot d w need non a g r d p spot scenario 3 if p spot p 1 and 0 w need non a g r q the demander will exercise part of the water option in this scenario the water demander shall pay both the option premium q p 2 and the water option purchasing fee w need non a g r p 1 to the irrigation area the irrigation area will also receive the repurchase income of excess water from the administration w tra t agr k w need non a g r p spot to sum up the expected return function s 3 of the irrigation area in scenario 3 is expressed as 10 s 3 p 1 0 q q p 2 w need non a g r p 1 w tra t agr k w need non a g r p spot f w need non a g r f p spot d w need non a g r d p spot scenario 4 if p spot p 1 and w need non a g r q the demander will exercise all the water options similar to scenario 3 the water demander shall pay q p 2 and q p 1 to the irrigation area the irrigation area will also receive the repurchasing income of excess water from the administration w tra t agr k q p spot to sum up the expected return function s 4 of the irrigation area in scenario 4 is expressed as 11 s 4 p 1 q q p 2 q p 1 w tra t agr k q p spot f w need non a g r f p spot d w need non a g r d p spot it can be seen from the above analysis that after the prediction of tradable water in phase 1 if w tra t agr k q the total expected income of wot in irrigation area is r wot r pla t agr k s where r pla t agr k denotes the crop planting income s s s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 denotes the wot income 2 when w tra t agr k q the irrigation area will consider whether to increase tradable water through adjusting the planting structure to satisfy the water demand contract if the irrigation area does not adjust the structure it may not be able to participate in the wot and can solely obtain the crop planting income r pla t agr k therefore if the irrigation area does not trade in water options the total expected income is r 1 r pla t agr k on the contrary if the area adjusts the planting structure it will obtain the adjusted crop planting income r tra t agr k a d j and the wot income s therefore if the irrigation area trades in water options by adjusting the planting structure the total expected income is r 2 r tra t agr k a d j s 3 3 calculation model of wotw this phase explores the change of wotw in irrigation areas with heterogeneous resource endowments considering the impact of interest and trust on willingness the dynamically evolving model of wotw is constructed according to the wot motivated incomes of crop planting and option trading obtained above which can be expressed as follows 12 wot w t wot w t 1 1 α u δ r wot emp δ r wot adv δ r wot emp δ r wot adv r wot act r n w o t act δ r wot emp δ r wot adv w o t w t 1 1 α d δ r wot emp δ r ws adv δ r wot emp δ r wot adv o t h e r w i s e in the above equation 12 wot w t denotes the wotw of the irrigation area in period t to which larger value of wot w t implies more inclination of the irrigation area to trade water options in period t similarly wot w t 1 is the wotw of the irrigation area in period t 1 which reflects the basic influence of the historical willingness on the wotw update α u α d is the sensitivity coefficient which expresses the increase decrease rate of wotw by setting the values of α u α d the variation characteristics of wotw can be reflected combining with actual situation the wotw is more sensitive to failed wot practices which means that the wotw will be reduced significantly if the actual benefits r wot act of conducting wot is less than those r n w o t act of not conducting wot or the deviation between the actual and the expected income of wot using in advance prediction δ r wot adv δ r wot adv 0 is larger than that of using empirical predication δ r wot emp δ r wot emp 0 one reasonable explanation is that on one hand wot cannot bring more benefits on the other hand the accuracy of in advance prediction is not satisfactory or even worse than empirical prediction so the irrigation area s trust in prediction is reduced conversely reaching a high level of wotw requires continuous accumulation of some successful wot practices i e r wot act r n w o t act and δ r wot emp δ r wot adv it is easy to prove that δ r wot emp δ r wot adv δ r wot emp δ r wot adv 1 1 especially when δ r wot emp δ r wot adv 0 then δ r wot emp δ r wot adv δ r wot emp δ r wot adv 0 1 this suggests that when the accuracy of in advance predictions is better than that of empirical ones the willingness of irrigation areas to conduct wot based on in advance prediction information will increase on the contrary when δ r wot emp δ r wot adv 0 then δ r wot emp δ r wot adv δ r wot emp δ r wot adv 1 0 which will inhibit the wotw of the irrigation area 4 case study the proposed model was applied in the bayannur with typical irrigation areas to which the corresponding results are illustrated as follows 4 1 study site the bayannur locating in the west of the inner monggol autonomous region and north of the yellow river is one of the three largest irrigation areas in china the areas stretches across five districts counties in bayannur including linhe lh dengkou dk hanggin rear banner hb wuyuan wy and urad banner ub covering an area of 65000 km2 with 803 565 ha farmland and a population of 1 728 559 in 2020 the reasonable for choosing the bayannur as the case study are presented as follows 1 water demanders are short of water as the economy develops the water demand of various industries in bayannur is emerging for which reason the initial allocation of water resources cannot satisfy the needs of regional development 2 agricultural has the water saving potential bayannur has been developing its irrigated agriculture which relies largely on the yellow river to grow wheat corn sunflower melon and other crops in this region although agriculture accounts for 87 of its total water consumption however the effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water is less than 0 4 and the gross agricultural production accounts for only 46 of the total local revenue 2018 data 3 policy support bayannur has been listed as a pilot area for water rights trading by china s ministry of water resources which puts forward new requirements for regional development on one hand as an important commodity grain production base securing regional food safety is of utmost importance on the other hand it is of critical necessity to develop water saving agriculture while facilitating the conversion of agricultural water to non agricultural water by activating marketplace for water options trading 4 to facilitate studying the five regions counties in bayannur are geographically adjacent and have similar planting preferences hydrological and market environment which helps control the variables to analyze the impact of heterogeneous water and land resource endowments on wotw in each region county 4 2 data collection this paper designs three types of dataset namely the actual data the empirical prediction data and the in advance prediction data the first one refers to the real data from 2011 to 2020 obtained from authoritative documents and reports such as inner mongolia statistical yearbook bayannur water resources bulletin and main crop water requirement and irrigation of china the second one means that the predicted data is obtained by calculating the average value of the actual data in the previous five years for example the data of 2014 is predicted by calculating the average value of the actual data from 2009 to 2013 the last one means that the data is obtained by adopting some advanced prediction methods based on the empirical data in this paper the grey model is used for predicting w tra t agr k and a t total while the probability statistics are for p spot and w need non a g r respectively the sources and corresponding relationships of the three external datasets are shown in fig 2 specifically in phase 1 of the above fig 2 the actual data of water arable land resource and main crop data of each irrigation area are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively in phase 2 the water option contract is c 3 5 0 1 q 1 based on the reality where q is the analysis variable being used to discuss the evolution of wotw in irrigation areas when facing different contracted water demands in addition combining with historical data the fitting results suggest that both the probability distribution of p spot and w need non a g r approximate gauss distribution where p spot n 4 1 0 252 w need non a g r n 19597537 12749572 in phase 3 it is assumed that the initial wotw of each irrigation area is 0 5 considering that the rate of decrease in willingness is higher than that of increase so set α u 0 4 α d 0 6 4 3 results and discussion 4 3 1 comparative analysis of resource endowments in each irrigation area 1 actual data in order to investigate the influence of resource heterogeneity in irrigation areas on the wotw this part compares the endowments of water and arable land in each irrigation area based on actual data 2009 2020 as shown in fig 3 a 3 b and 3 c in general the five irrigated areas exhibit distinctive differences in terms of the endowments of arable land and water resources per unit of arable land specifically the sequencing of arable land resource endowments satisfies ub wy lh hb dk the sequencing of water resource endowments satisfies ub lh wy hb dk the sequencing of water resource endowments per unit of arable land satisfies hb dk lh wy ub moreover the concentration of the data in the figure reflects the inter annual variation of endowments to which more concentrated data implies smaller inter annual variation in endowments according to the above results the resource endowments of each irrigation area are further subdivided into three subgroups high h medium m and low l to which the corresponding sequencing of the subdivision results is presented as follows arable land resource endowments h ub m wy lh l hb dk water resource endowments h ub m lh wy hb l dk water resource endowments per unit of arable land h hb dk m lh wy l ub which is shown in fig 4 the links in the figure represent the relevance and the results suggest that except for wy and lh the matching between arable land and water resources in other irrigation areas is not balanced for example the water resource endowments of the area ub may be lower than the water demand of its arable land on the contrary the water resource endowments of the areas dk and hb may exceed the water demand of their arable land 2 prediction data as aforementioned this study designs three types of comparative datasets the resource endowments of each irrigation area 2014 2020 are predicted based on the method of empirical and in advanced predictions after which the mean with standard deviation sd results of the three datasets are compared as shown in fig 5 the results suggest that these two prediction methods can effectively predict the water and arable land resource endowments in irrigation areas among which the results of in advance prediction are generally better than those of empirical prediction particularly the in advance prediction exhibits significant advantages when the inter annual variation of arable land resource endowments in irrigation areas is large such as ub dk or when that of water resource endowments is large such as ub 4 3 2 evolutionary analysis of wotw in order to investigate the evolution of wotw based on prediction information in heterogeneous irrigation areas four scenarios of contracted water demand are designed to simulate the scarcity of tradable water i e 5 10 15 and 20 the differentiated design of contractual demand scenarios enhances the applicability of this framework specifically 5 means that the contracted water demand exceeds 5 of the tradable water predicted by the irrigation area i e q 1 5 w tra t agr k which can also be interpreted as the water deficient ratio in the irrigation area planning to trade water option and the same implications apply for the contracted water demands of 10 15 20 then based on the willingness calculation model the evolution of the wotw from 2014 to 2020 in the five irrigation areas is analyzed to which the results are shown in fig 6 with respect to the evolving trend of wotw it can be observed from fig 6 that all the evolving wotw in irrigation areas lh dk and hb exhibit a general upward trend which can be attributed to two aspects on one hand in recent years the water endowments of each irrigation area has shown an increasing trend year by year which can increase the amount of tradable water in irrigation areas on the other hand the prediction information has proven to be reliable which is conducive to reducing the risk of wot however the evolution of wotw in irrigation areas wy and ub fluctuated markedly which attributes to the fact that wy and ub have less water resource endowments per unit of arable land this further weakens their risk prevention ability of wot to hedge against uncertainties leaving them vulnerable to volatility in water option returns considering contracted water demand in each irrigation area fig 6 a and 6 d suggest that when the contracted water demand varies from 10 to 15 the wotw in both areas of lh and wy are relatively large furthermore neither too high 20 nor too low 5 contracted water demand is capable of stimulating the wotw of lh and wy the reason is that the water and arable land resources are relatively matched and their inter annual variation is small in lh and wy in this case only can a modest contracted water demand motivate lh and wy to participate in wot fig 6 b shows that within the variation range from 5 to 20 of the contracted water demand no significant difference can be found in the wotw of the irrigation area dk and even in the later period 2019 2020 the evolution of the wotw stagnates in dk the above phenomenon attributes to the large endowments and inter annual variation of water resource per unit of arable land in dk which enhances the adaptability of the irrigation area to small scale fluctuations in water demand in this case further evolution of wotw may require higher water demands as shown in fig 6 c within the variation range of the contracted water demand from 5 to 20 the wotw in the hb area increases with the increase in contracted water demand one reasonable explanation for the above phenomenon is the abundant endowments and small inter annual variation of water resource per unit of arable land in hb which undoubtedly increases the tradable water and the ability to hedge the risk of wot in hb undersuchcircumstance motivated by wot benefits hb is more inclined to sign a water option contract with a larger water demand fig 6 e shows that the wotw of ub increases steadily as the contracted water demand increases from 5 to 15 however when the contracted water demand increases to 20 a sharp drop occurs in wotw which can be attributed to the smaller endowments and inter annual variation of water resource per unit of arable land in ub therefore ub is more inclined to sign a water option contract with a relatively stable water demand once the contract water demand exceeds a certain threshold the wotw of ub will decrease in conclusion when the water and arable land resources are relatively matched and their inter annual variation is small the irrigation area is more inclined to sign a water option contract with a modest water demand when the water and arable land resources are relatively large and their inter annual variation is small the irrigation area is more inclined to sign a water option contract with a larger water demand when the water and arable land resources are relatively small and their inter annual variation is larger a relatively stable water option contract should be designed for the irrigation area 4 3 3 intensity analysis of wotw in this subsection the influences of different resource endowments and contracted water demand imposed on the intensity of wotw in irrigation areas are analyzed which is shown in fig 7 and fig 8 fig 7 shows the mean value of the wotw in different irrigation areas under different contracted water demands from 2014 to 2020 the results suggest that the intensity of wotw in these five heterogeneous irrigation areas varies considerably and satisfies the following sequencing result hb lh dk ub wy similarly according to the above results it is further subdivided into three subgroups h hb m lh dk l ub wy fig 8 analyzes the relevance between the intensity of wotw in irrigation areas and that between water resource endowments per unit of arable land and its inter annual variation the results suggest that the intensity of wotw in irrigation areas is determined by water resource endowment per unit of arable land and is affected by the inter annual fluctuation of water resource endowment per unit of arable land to some extent in other words greater water resource endowment per unit of arable land indicates greater wotw of irrigation areas larger inter annual variation of the water resource endowment per unit of arable land implies more inclination of weakening the intensity of wotw in irrigation areas for example among those areas hb possesses the largest water resource endowment per unit of arable land and the smallest inter annual variation of water resource endowment per unit of arable land in this case hb has the greatest intensity of wotw remarkably despite the water resource endowment per unit of arable land in dk wy is greater than that in lh ub the final sequencing result of wotw intensity is dk lh wy ub which can be attributed to the greater inter annual variation of the water resource endowment per unit of arable land in dk wy than that of lh ub in addition by comparing dk and ub it can be found that the inter annual variation of the water resource endowment per unit of arable land exerts a rather limited influence on the intensity of wotw whereas the water resource endowment per unit of arable land plays a decisive role in wotw intensity of irrigation areas the causes for the above results owe to the following reasons one reason is that larger water resource endowment per unit of arable land is more conducive to realize trade off between crop planting and wot additionally rich water resource endowments also help the irrigation area hedge against the risk of wot brought by the complex hydrological and market environments the other explanation is that if large inter annual variation of the water resources endowment per unit of arable land happens the water and arable land resource of the irrigation area becomes considerably complex which will inevitably increase the difficulty of scientific prediction on resource endowments in this scenario the irrigation area is prone to conduct irrational wot decisions under which circumstance the deviation between the expected income and the actual income will decrease the wotw of the irrigation area in the next round of wot fig 9 shows the mean value of wotw in different irrigation areas with different contracted water demand the results suggest that the wotw intensity of irrigation areas with heterogeneous resource endowments has different response mechanisms to cope with different contracted water demand for instance lh and hb in particular are sensitive to the change of contracted water demand the percentages of 10 5 20 10 and 15 are the optimal contracted water demand to stimulate the wotw intensity in lh dk hb wy and ub respectively fig 10 shows the matching relationship between the optimal contracted water demand and the irrigation areas with different inter annual deviation of water resource endowment per unit of arable land the results suggest that larger inter annual variation of water resource endowment per unit of arable land implies smaller optimal contracted water demand which can be explained as follows large inter annual variation of the water resource endowment per unit of arable land will increase the profitable risks in wot in order to hedge risks irrigation areas are inclined to participate in water options trading with smaller contractual water demand fig 11 shows the intensity of wotw under different resource endowment and contracted water demand scenarios for example if the contracted water demand is 20 the total wotw intensity in the five irrigation areas is 25 suggesting that the total wotw intensity in these areas reaches its maximum and minimum when the contracted water demand is 10 and 5 respectively as the contracted water demand increases from 10 to 20 the total wotw intensity in these areas gradually decreases in view of the above analysis when only one water demand contract can be designed 10 is the optimal contracted water demand which can make the intensity of wotw of these five irrigation districts reach the maximum value 4 3 4 potential analysis of improving wotw the potential for improving wotw is closely correlated with the irrigation areas resource endowments and external incentives therefore this potential can be reflected to some degree through analyzing the distribution range of the wotw in heterogeneous irrigation areas in different planning years and contracted water demand if the wotw distribution is relatively concentrated it indicates that the wotw in irrigation areas is less affected by the inter annual variation of resource endowments and different contracted water demand scenarios which limits the potential for improving the wotw in irrigation areas whereas relatively scattered distribution of the wotw suggests the opposite result fig 12 shows the wotw distribution in these five irrigation areas from 2014 to 2020 in four contracted water demand scenarios according to the result the wotw distribution in the areas of hb lh and dk are relatively scattered whereas the wotw distribution in wy and ub are relatively concentrated the sequencing result of the potential for improving the wotw in these five areas is hb lh dk ub wy similarly according to the above results these areas are further subdivided into three subgroups h hb m lh dk l ub wy in terms of the wotw distribution scope the wotw distribution in the areas of lh hb and ub is mainly concentrated in the end of the scope i e the end has the highest wotw density suggesting great potential in improving the wotw particularly the wotw in the end of the scope the wotw distribution in dk is concentrated at both ends and the middle of the distribution scope in particular since the wotw in the middle is usually not stable enough and susceptible to external factors it should be promoted first in addition the wotw in wy is concentrated at the top of the scope suggesting limited potential in improving the wotw fig 13 shows the relevance between the wotw intensity and the potential in improving the wotw of each area suggesting that larger wotw intensity indicates greater potential in improving the wotw the above results reveal that the potential for improving wotw has the characteristics of the matthew effect i e the improve potential is determined by the resource endowments of the irrigation area and is affected by certain external incentives such as optimal contract water demand fig 14 shows the wotw distribution in these five irrigation areas under different contracted water demand scenarios it can be observed that when the contracted water demand is 10 5 20 5 and 15 respectively the wotw distribution range of the irrigation areas of lh dk hb wy and ub is the widest having the greatest potential in improving the wotw in these five areas the above results suggest that when the contracted water demand scenario satisfies the optimal contracted water demand of each irrigation area the potential for improving the wotw of each area is the largest 5 conclusions this study focuses on exploring the influence of water and arable land heterogeneity in irrigation areas on their sole discretion to trade water options proposing improvement measures to facilitate wot under uncertain hydrological and market environments through integrating multi objective optimization with expected utility theory the optimal allocation of crop planting water and expected returns in heterogeneous irrigation areas motivated by wot are analyzed and the model that measures the wotw in the areas using prediction information is proposed the case study of bayannur adopts the proposed model the conclusions and managerial insights of this paper are formulated as follows a mian conclusions 1 instead of affected by the amount of a single resource endowment the wotw is largely affected by the matching equilibrium of water and arable land resources in irrigation areas 2 smaller water resource endowment per unit of arable land in the irrigation area implies larger fluctuation of the wotw evolution increasing the amount of tradable water and the accuracy of prediction information is conducive to the upward evolving of wotw 3 greater water resource endowment per unit of arable land suggests stronger wotw of irrigated areas furthermore larger inter annual variation of the water resource endowment per unit of arable land indicates more inclination of the wotw intensity in irrigated areas to be weakened and more inclination of the irrigation area participating in wot with smaller contractual water demand 4 the potential for improving wotw is consistent with the wotw intensity in irrigation areas to some extent which suggests that greater wotw intensity in irrigation areas implies more potential for improving wotw b managerial insights 1 the influence mechanism of water and arable land endowments on the wotw should be analyzed from comprehensive perspective of water resource endowment per unit of arable land and the wotw in irrigation areas can be maximized by coordinating the allocation of water and arable land resources 2 the steady wotw evolution in irrigation areas can be achieved by not only increasing the water resource endowment per unit of arable land but applying scientific prediction methodologies in particular increasing the water resource endowment per unit of arable land mainly involves two approaches under the condition of constant arable land resources one approach is to increase the water resource endowments in irrigation areas by increasing the allocation of water resources and reducing the water consumption for crop planting under the condition of constant water resources the other approach is to reduce the demand for arable land resources in irrigation areas by optimizing agricultural planting structure or by developing high yield high quality and high efficiency agriculture 3 the wotw intensity in irrigation areas is determined by the water resource endowment per unit of arable land and is affected by the inter annual fluctuation of water resource endowment per unit of arable land to some extent therefore balancing the inter annual allocation of water and arable land resources in irrigation areas is beneficial to increasing the wotw in irrigation areas moreover for irrigation areas with large inter annual variation in water endowment per unit of arable land smaller contractual water demand is more likely to motivate them to participate in wot 4 in terms of the potential for improving wotw of contracted water demand when the conditions of appropriate water resource endowment per unit of arable land and its small inter annual variation are satisfied contract with moderate water demand has the greatest potential for improving the wotw when the water resource endowment per unit of arable land and its inter annual variation is large the amount of contracted water demand has little potential for improving the wotw when the water resource endowment per unit of arable land is small and its inter annual variation is large contract with appropriate water demand has the great potential for improving the wotw in this study although the research framework has comprehensively considered the conventional mechanism of wot its application may be limited by several countries that are hydrologically or statutorily dissimilar our future researching interest will be focusing on these factors enabling this study to be applied to a wider community credit authorship

2877,reservoir flood control operation is an important and effective measure for avoiding or reducing flood disasters considering that reservoir operation is a control process that essentially manages the spillway gates to increase or decrease the amount of released water this paper focuses on studying the reservoir flood control operation which considers spillway gate scheduling minimizing the peak outflow from the reservoir is adopted as the optimization objective to protect downstream areas from flood disasters in addition to the conventional reservoir constraints the operation constraints of individual spillway gates and the influence of the reservoir forebay water level and opening degree on the gates discharge capacity are also well considered to obtain precise scheduling the nonlinear factors especially the objective function in the form of maximin the three dimensional water discharge curves and the rules for the opening and closing sequence of the spillway gates are linearized through several strategies the original nonlinear and non convex model is then converted into a standard mixed integer linear programming milp formulation the results for the real world case study indicate that 1 the proposed model is believed to be computationally efficient with a calculation time of about 30 min 2 for the flood events with return periods of 10 years and 100 years the flood peaks are reduced from 4160 m3 s to 3681 m3 s and from 11007 m3 s to 9293 m3 s representing decreases of 11 5 and 15 6 respectively the outflow curves become more stable demonstrating that the flood control pressure on the downstream had been relieved after optimization 3 the proposed model can produce more realistic and executable flood control operation scheduling compared with the conventional optimization model without considering spillway gate scheduling these research findings can provide an effective reference for both the operators of reservoirs and researchers in the field of reservoir flood control operation keywords flood control operation spillway gate scheduling gate operation rules water discharge curves mixed integer linear programming data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods are the most important and common natural disaster in the world the economic loss caused by flooding ranks first among many types of disaster and poses a major threat to economic development people s lives and property safety albano et al 2017 apurv et al 2015 arnell and gosling 2016 reservoirs as a control measure with a regulating function play a prominent role in the flood control of rivers by regulating and storing flood water hence the construction and operation of reservoirs in flood control systems has become an important and effective measure for flood control and disaster reduction teng et al 2017 scholars in china and abroad have carried out a lot of research and exploration into the problem of reservoir flood control operation to reduce flood control risk meng et al meng et al 2019 proposed a framework of flood control operation for cascade reservoirs coupled with risk assessment fcora and a corresponding fcora model that contains three sub modules zhang et al zhang et al 2019 studied the real time reservoir flood control operation for cascade reservoirs using a two stage flood risk analysis method li et al li et al 2019 proposed a dynamic and intelligent modeling method for the joint operation of a flood control system which can alleviate the curse of dimensionality by reducing the number of reservoirs for flood control operation lu et al lu et al 2020 proposed a risk analysis model for reservoir flood control operation under two dimensional uncertainties based on bayesian network cuevas velásquez et al cuevas velásquez et al 2020 presented a real time flood control model that brings together the advantages of an optimization model based on mixed integer linear programming milp and a case based learning scheme using bayesian networks chen et al chen et al 2020 developed a multi objective risk management model for real time optimal flood control operation for a parallel reservoir system during flood season considering the uncertainties of reservoir in flows and lateral inflows wan et al wan et al 2021 focused on establishing linkage between flood limited water levels and flood forecasting technology thus developing a dynamic pre storm level approach for reservoir flood control operations zha et al zha et al 2021 proposed an optimization method combining dynamic programming dp progressive optimality algorithm poa and particle swarm optimization pso for the joint flood control operation of large scale reservoirs these studies mainly aim to use optimization algorithms to optimize reservoir operations and provide an optimal policy for flood control however the optimal results for reservoir operations mostly focus on water discharge and do not distribute the water discharge to the spillway gates as the reservoir discharge capacity is not fixed and depends on the combination of spillage gates at the current forebay water level conventional flood control operation which does not consider the optimal control of the spillway gates is not accurate and makes it difficult to directly guide the actual flood control operation considering that reservoir operation is a control process that essentially manages the spillway gates to increase or decrease the amount of released water this paper places emphasis on the optimal reservoir flood control operation considering spillway gate scheduling i e determining the hourly revervoir water level and allocating the total water discharge to each spillway gate the coupling of conventional reservoir constraints the complex rules of spillway gate operation and the influence of the reservoir forebay water level and opening degree on the gates discharge capacity make the reservoir flood control operation problem combined with spillway gate scheduling very challenging for operators and researchers in practical engineering application the reservoir flood control operation problem is adressed first and and each spillway gate s operation status opening degree is then determined based on the optimized forebay water level and total water discharge of the reservoir the trial and error methods are usually performed but it takes a large amount of time and is difficult to obtain ideal results at present there are few studies on reservoir operation for flood control which consider the combination of spillway gates chen et al chen et al 2016 established a floodgate combination table to distribute specific reservoir discharge to the floodgates based on the water discharge distribution principle and proposed a multi step progressive optimality algorithm for optimal floodgate operation in cascade reservoirs however when the water level of the reservoir fluctuates greatly and there are many spillway gates in the reservoir there may be a large number of floodgate combination schemes for a certain outflow in the floodgate table resulting in a very low search efficiency bagis and karaboga bagis and karaboga 2007 developed an evolutionary algorithm based fuzzy proportional derivative pd type controller for the real time control of spillway gates during the flood season karaboga et al karaboga et al 2008 proposed an operation method based on fuzzy logic control to automatically realize the operation of the spillway gates of the catalan dam in turkey feng and liu feng and liu 2014 proposed a mixed integer linear programming milp model to optimize the spillway gate scheduling i e determine the index of opened spillway gates and the opening degree of each spillway gate for reservoir flood control liu et al liu et al 2017 used poa to determine the multi objective reservoir operation during flood season considering spillway optimization and a smooth support vector machine model was then applied to abstract the optimal operation rules which consider the order and the number of spillways kim et al kim et al 2021 introduced a novel optimization method based on the pso algorithm combined with the rearrangement method of the particle solution groups to directly determine the optimal operation rules of the reservoir floodgates however their models all take one day as the scheduling period which is not accurate enough moreover they assume that individual spillway gates are either closed or fully open and the opening degree of spillway gates is not considered which makes the models less universally applicable flood control operation which considers the combination of spillway gates is a typical mixed integer nonlinear programming minlp problem and is very difficult to solve due to its non convex nonlinear and noncontinuous features belotti et al 2013 at present the conventional methods for reservoir operation including dp he et al 2021 poa jiang et al 2018 linear programming lp brandão 2010 nonlinear programming nlp huang et al 2019 and modern intelligent algorithms e g genetic algorithm shang et al 2017 and pso lu et al 2020 he et al 2014 all have great difficulties in solving this problem for example dp and poa are prone to the dimensional disaster problem when the number of spillway gates is large the lp and nlp methods cannot consider the status of individual spillway gates and thus are not suitable for dealing with the present problem modern intelligent algorithms are simple and widely adaptable but the stability of the results cannot be guaranteed strictly because of their stochastic optimization characteristics and they easily fall into local optimal solutions when very complex problems are encountered with the development of optimization software the milp approach is becoming more and more mature and has been widely used in reservoir operation because of its excellent performance in handling very complex constraints cuevas velásquez et al 2020 feng and liu 2014 su et al 2020 lu et al 2021 generally global or near global optimal results can be obtained within an acceptable solving time finardi et al 2016 ramos et al 2015 considering the above issues this paper focuses on developing an milp based optimization model for reservoir flood control operation which considers spillway gate scheduling the model aims to protect downstream areas from flood disasters by minimizing the peak outflow from the reservoir in order to speed up the solution time and obtain the global optimal solution the original nonlinear and non convex model is converted into a standard milp formulation through several linearization strategies the rationality and validity of the proposed model are verified by taking the flood control operation of the gongguoqiao reservoir located on the lancang river i e mekong river in southwest china as an example compared with the existing research the main contributions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 the optimal reservoir flood control operation considering spillway gate scheduling is studied in this paper in addition to the conventional reservoir constraints the operation constraints of individual spillway gates and the influence of the reservoir forebay water level and opening degree on the gates discharge capacity are also well considered making the optimization model and obtained flood control operation scheduling more refined 2 the nonlinear relationship between the water discharge reservoir forebay water level and opening degree of each spillway gate is represented by water discharge curves which are drawn based on the historical measured data a novel technique is then proposed to linearize the three dimensional water discharge curves 3 the optimization results obtained from the realistic case studies demonstrate that the proposed model is computationally efficient and produces more realistic and executable flood control operation scheduling than the conventional optimization model which does not consider spillway gate scheduling the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 establishes the mathematical formulation for the present problem and linearization strategies for the nonlinear objective functions and constraints are proposed the optimization results of the real world case studies are presented and discussed in section 3 finally conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 objective function the goal of the reservoir flood control is to ensure the safety of the dam and satisfy the downstream flood control requirements as dam safety can be achieved by limiting the highest reservoir level and the reservoirs have a responsibility to protect downstream areas from flood disasters minimizing the peak outflow from the reservoir is adopted as the objective of this study the objective function is presented as below 1 f min max 1 t t q t where t is the total number of time periods t is the index of time periods q t denotes the total water discharge of the reservoir in time period t in m3 s it should be noted that the local inflow of the flood control section located downstream is is not considered in this model 2 2 constraints the flood control constraints are presented as below a reservoir constraints 1 water balance constraints 2 v t v t 1 3600 i t q t δ t 3 q t q t p q t f q t p i 1 i q i t where i t denotes the forecasted reservoir inflow in time period t in m3 s δ t is the duration of period t and is set to 1 h in this model v t denotes the water storage of the reservoir at the end of time period t in m3 q t f denotes the water released from all of the spillways in m3 s q t p denotes the generating water flow i e the water released from all of the turbines in m3 s i and i represent the set and index of the spillways in the reservoir respectively q i t denotes the water discharge of spillway i in time period t in m3 s considering that hydropower plants usually operate at maximum capacity during the flood season in order to make full use of hydropower resources q t p is set to q max p i e the maximum generating water flow of the hydropower plant during the whole scheduling period for the sake of simplicity 2 water storage constraints 4 v min v t v max 5 v 0 v b v t v e where v max and v min denote the upper and lower bounds of the water storage of the reservoir respectively in m3 v b denotes the initial water storage of the reservoir in m3 v e denotes the target water storage of the reservoir at the end of the scheduling horizon in m3 3 water discharge constraints 6 q min q t q max 7 ε q t q t 1 ε where q min and q max denote the minimum and maximum total water discharge respectively in period t in m3 s ε is the maximum allowable variation of reservoir discharge in adjacent periods in m3 s constraints 6 and 7 are used to ensure the comprehensive water demand and flood control safety of the downstream b individual spillway gate constraints 1 water discharge limits 8 0 q i t u i t q i m a x where q i m a x denotes the maximum allowable water discharge of spillway i in m3 s u i t is a binary variable that is equal to 1 if the ith spillway gate is in open status in time period t but is equal to 0 otherwise 2 constraints on open and closed duration generally speaking the shorter the opening and closing time of the spillway gates the more flexible the gate operation and the better the flood control effect of the reservoir however the frequent opening and closing of the spillway gates will significantly increase the operation cost of the reservoir and affect the service life of the gate control system hence the minimum required open and closed durations of each spillway gate are set to 3 h in this model 9 x i t η t 1 t α i 1 y i η 1 y i t η t 1 t β i 1 x i η 1 x i t y i t 0 1 10 x i t y i t u i t u i t 1 x i t y i t 1 where x i t and y i t are 0 1 indicator variables if spillway gate i is opened in time period t x i t is equal to 1 otherwise it is equal to 0 if spillway gate i is closed in time period t y i t is equal to 1 otherwise it is equal to 0 α i and β i denote the minimum required open and closed durations of spillway gate i in h respectively the current status of the spillway gates can have a significant impact on the spillway gate scheduling in this paper we assume that all spillway gates are closed before the arrival of the flood events and their closed duration is in line with the minimum required closed duration and the reservoir can release water by the turbines in the hydropower plant 3 water discharge function 11 q i t f i q z o i t z t 1 z t 2 12 z t f zv v t 13 o i t 1 m u i t 1 o i t m 1 u i t where o i t denotes the opening degree of spillway gate i in time period t it should be noted that the opening degree is usually limited to several specific numbers in practical engineering applications such as 1 2 and 3 to prevent the spillway gates from being adjusted too frequently f i q z denotes the relative function between the water discharge the opening degree of spillway gate i and the forebay water level of the reservoir f zv represents the relation function between the water level and water storage of the reservoir m is a very large positive number constraint 13 represents the relationship between the opening and closing statuses and the opening degree of the spillway gates when spillway gate i is open in period t i e u i t 1 o i t 1 otherwise o i t 0 4 rules for gate opening and closing a reservoir that undertakes the task of flood control usually has a variety of spillways such as surface outlets and bottom outlets we suppose that the numbers of surface outlets and bottom outlets are i 1 and i 2 respectively 1 to avoid severe vibration of the spillway gates and ensure the safety of the dam the spillway gates are required to open or close symmetrically this symmetry rules can be described as follows 14 o m t s o m 1 t s o m 1 t s o m 2 t s o 1 t s o 2 m t s if i 1 2 m m 1 2 3 15 o m 1 t s o m 1 t s o m 2 t s o m 2 t s o 1 t s o 2 m 1 t s if i 1 2 m 1 m 1 2 3 16 o n t b o n 1 t b o n 1 t b o n 2 t b o 1 t b o 2 n t b if i 2 2 n n 1 2 3 17 o n 1 t b o n 1 t b o n 2 t b o n 2 t b o 1 t b o 2 n 1 t b if i 2 2 n 1 n 1 2 3 where o m t s and o n t b denote the opening degrees of surface outlet m and bottom outlet n respectively 2 the spillway gates usually have a specific opening and closing sequence for example opening the middle gates has a higher priority than opening the side gates and the surface outlets have a higher priority than the bottom outlets because the long term operation of the bottom outlets will have a negative impact on the slope of the downstream river and buildings moreover the closing priorities of these gates have the opposite order the opening and closing sequence of the spillway gates is shown as follows 18 p o m t s p o m 1 t s p o 1 t s p o n t b p o n 1 t b p o 1 t b where p denotes the opening priorities of the spillway gates 2 3 milp model formulation in the above model eq 1 contains a function of the minimax form which is nonlinear eq 11 is a function of two variables which represents the nonlinear relationship between the water discharge opening degree of the spillway gates and the reservoir water level the relationship between water level and water storage i e eq 12 is also usually a nonlinear function eq 18 contains the abstract mapping relationship between gate type gate position and gate opening and closing priority to sum up there are four nonlinear factors in the above model i e eqs 1 11 12 and 18 which need to be linearized so that the original minlp model can be transformed into an milp model that meets the accuracy requirements then a mature and efficient optimization solver can be used for solving the milp model considering that there have been many literatures on the linearization of the relationship between water level and water storage tong et al 2013 cheng et al 2018 this section mainly focuses on linearizing the objective function and the water discharge function of the spillways 2 3 1 linearization of the objective function firstly one auxiliary variable q is introduced which needs to satisfy eq 19 19 q t q t 1 t then eq 1 can be translated into eq 20 20 f min q since eqs 19 and 20 are linear the objective function can be linearized through eqs 19 and 20 2 3 2 linear approximation of the water discharge function of the spillway gates as shown in eq 11 the water discharge of each spillway is determined jointly by its opening degree and the reservoir water level a precise modelling of the water discharge function requires finite element analysis chen et al 2020 defina and susin 2003 in actual engineering applications the water discharge function of the spillways is usually described by a series of nonlinear curves based on the historical measured data as shown in fig 1 which are called water discharge curves each curve represents the relationship between the water discharge and opening degree of the spillway gates under a specified reservoir water level based on the water discharge curves a novel linear formulation for the water discharge function of spillways is presented in this subsection within the maximum and minimum possible water level range during the scheduling horizon three curves representing the relationship between water discharge and the opening degree of the spillway gate are selected corresponding to high z h medium z m and low z l reservoir water levels respectively as shown in fig 1 the opening degree is usually limited to several specific numbers in practical engineering applications the opening degrees of spillway gate i are limited to k levels which are marked with dotted lines in fig 1 accordingly the water discharge can be formulated using the following linear constraints 21 r i k t 0 1 k 1 2 k 22 k 1 k r i k t u i t 23 λ i k t v 0 v 1 2 3 a n d k 1 2 k 24 v 1 3 λ i k t v r i k t 25 z t z t 1 2 k 1 k v 1 3 λ i k t v z i k v 26 z t z t 1 2 k 1 k v 1 3 λ i k t v z i k v m 1 u i t 27 o i t k 1 k v 1 3 λ i k t v o i k v 28 q i t k 1 k v 1 3 λ i k t v q i k v where k is the index of the opening degree v is the index of the intersections of the three water level lines and a specific opening degree line z i k v o i k v and q i k v denote the reservoir water level opening degree and water discharge of spillway i at the vth intersection under opening degree k respectively r i k t is a binary variable and when r i k t is equal to 1 it means that the opening degree of spillway gate i in time period t is k λ i j t l v denotes the weighting coefficient of the vth intersection corresponding to opening degree k in time period t eqs 21 22 force spillway gate i to be kept open at only a single opening degree in time period t eqs 23 24 indicate that if the opening degree of spillway gate i is k i e r i k t 1 the sum of the weighting coefficients of its three intersections is equal to 1 otherwise the weighting coefficients are all 0 eqs 25 26 are used to interpolate the reservoir water level if spillway gate i in time period t is in open status the reservoir water level must be equal to the sum of the weighted water level of each intersection otherwise eqs 25 and 26 are invalid similarly eqs 27 and 28 calculate the interpolation value for the opening degree and water discharge respectively in fact the weighing coefficients of each intersection can be calculated through eqs 21 27 and when these coefficients are determined the interpolated value for water discharge is then uniquely determined by eq 28 2 3 3 linearization of the rules for the opening and closing sequence of the spillway gates two auxiliary binary variables γ a t s and γ b t b are introduced and eq 18 can then be converted into the following linear constraints 29 γ a t s γ b t b 0 1 30 o a t s n m γ a t s a 1 2 i 1 31 n o a t s m 1 γ a t s 32 o b t b g m γ b t b b 1 2 i 2 33 g o b t b m 1 γ b t b 34 u m 1 t s m γ m t s u m 2 t s m γ m 1 t s u 1 t s m γ 2 t s u n t b m γ 1 t s u n 1 t b m γ n t b u n 2 t b m γ n 1 t b u 1 t b m γ 2 t b where γ a t s and γ b t b are binary indicator variables n and g are the thresholds for the opening degree of the surface outlets and the bottom outlets respectively eqs 29 33 can ensure that if the opening degree of surface outlet a reaches n then γ a t s 1 otherwise γ a t s 0 if the opening degree of bottom outlet b reaches g then γ b t b 1 otherwise γ b t b 0 eq 34 ensures that the spillway gates with lower priority can only be opened when the opening degree of the gates with higher priority reaches n g in order to minimize the number of gate openings 2 3 4 complete model solution process coupling the above mentioned linearization strategies the whole solution process of the present problem based on the milp approach is shown below 1 input data into the model including the forecasted reservoir inflow and the initial and target forebay water level of the reservoir 2 linearize the relation function of the water level and water storage eq 12 using the piecewise linear

in section 2 3 3 6 coupled with the other linear constraints presented in section 2 2 the original minlp formulation is converted into an milp one 7 solve the formulated milp model using efficient optimization solvers such as gurobi cplex and lingo 8 output optimization results including the forebay water level of the reservoir and the opening degree of each spillway gate 3 case studies the proposed model was applied to the flood control operation of the gongguoqiao reservoir located on the lancang river i e mekong river in southwest china to verify its rationality and validity the gongguoqiao reservoir is the most upstream hydropower plant in the middle and lower reaches of the lancang river and plays an important role in flood control power generation and irrigation the characteristics of the reservoir are presented in table 1 the gongguoqiao reservoir contains three types of spillways turbines surface outlets and bottom outlets it should be noted that the turbines are considered as spillways because of their flood discharge capacity and the discharge through the turbines during the flood events was set as the maximum discharge to make full use of available water resources for power generation the characteristics of various types of spillways are shown in table 2 and two kinds of operation constraints should be considered in spillway scheduling 1 the water discharge of each individual spillway depends on its type and opening degree as well as the reservoir water level the water discharge curves of different types of spillways are presented in fig 2 2 the spillway gates should be operated in a specific order which is described as follows 1 the spillway gates should be opened in the following order turbines surface outlets bottom outlets they should be closed in the reverse order 2 the opening of each surface outlet is set to one of five levels a gate with a lower priority can only be opened when the opening of a higher priority gate is greater than level 3 3 the spillway gates should be operated symmetrically to ensure that the water discharge can be distributed evenly along the dams to verify the validity of the model for dealing with floods of different magnitudes two flood events which occurred in 2005 named 200502 and 2017 named 201701 corresponding to hydrographs of floods with a 100 year and 10 year return period are used as the typical floods the details of the two flood events are shown in fig 3 the initial and target forebay water levels of the reservoir refer to the actual historical operational data in the case studies 1 h was taken as the time period the model was solved by gurobi optimizer which is developed by gurobi optimization company and is a powerful mathematical optimization solver for a variety of mathematical programming problems including lp quadratic programming qp quadratically constrained programming qcp milp mixed integer quadratic programming miqp and mixed integer quadratically constrained programming miqcp gurobi optimizer reference manual 2020 due to its excellent computing performance it has been widely used in power system scheduling manufacturing finance and other fields all tests were performed on a thinkpad pc with 16 gb of ram and quad core cpu the optimized total water discharge of the gongguoqiao reservoir in case study 1 and case study 2 were 3681 m3 s and 9293 m3 s respectively as shown in table 3 the corresponding calculation times were 1745 s and 2248 s respectively although there is only one single reservoir involved in the case studies solving the problem is still challenging due to the consideration of the spillway gate scheduling and the relatively long scheduling cycle for such a large scale problem the computation time of about 30 min is acceptable and meets the timeliness requirement of the flood control of the gongguoqiao reservoir detailed flood control scheduling of the gongguoqiao reservoir is presented in the following section 3 1 case study 1 optimal flood control operation for flood 201701 optimization results for the flood control operation of the gongguoqiao reservoir in case study 1 are illustrated in fig 4 the characteristic indexes of the flood event before and after optimization are shown in table 4 where range ratio denotes the ratio of range to peak value it can be seen that the outflow process becomes more stable after the optimal flood control operation of the gongguoqiao reservoir the flood peak and flood range have been reduced from 4160 m3 s to 3681 m3 s and from 1566 m3 s to 476 m3 s with decreases of 11 5 and 69 6 respectively at the same time the range ratio and the standard deviation of the flood process also decreased indicating that the outflow curve became more stable and that the flood control pressure on the downstream had been relieved after optimization fig 5 shows the forebay water level of the gongguoqiao reservoir in case study 1 it can be observed that the water level of the reservoir can satisfy the upper and lower limits which can guarantee the safety of the dam the water level at the end of the scheduling horizon was 1304 65 m and therefore meets the control requirements moreover the water level varies greatly during the operation period due to its relatively poor regulation performance therefore the influence of the change in reservoir water level on the water discharge of the spillway gates cannot be ignored due to the small magnitude of flood 201701 the gongguoqiao reservoir has sufficient flood control storage and thus only one surface outlet 3 is opened the opening degree of surface outlet 3 in each time period is shown in fig 6 the scheduling of the spillway gates is in accordance with the reservoir gate operation rules moreover the opening degree of surface outlet 3 changes a little in adjacent time periods and does not open and close frequently 3 2 case study 2 optimal flood control operation for flood 200502 flood event 200101 is significantly different compared to flood 201 901 in terms of flood magnitude flood peak and duration thus it is necessary to test the validity of the developed model when applied to the flood control operation for flood 200502 optimization results for the flood control operation of the gongguoqiao reservoir in case study 2 are presented in fig 7 and table 5 the flood peak and flood range have been reduced from 11007 m3 s to 9293 m3 s and from 7227 m3 s to 3804 m3 s with decreases of 15 6 and 47 4 respectively the range ratio and the standard deviation of the flood process are reduced by 37 7 and 34 9 respectively this demonstrates that the optimization results of the flood control operation for flood 200 502 are also reasonable and acceptable the reservoir forebay water level in case study 2 is shown in fig 8 as can be seen the water level water storage of the gongguoqiao reservoir is constantly adjusted to minimize the flood peak and ensure downstream safety but it never breaches its upper and lower limits due to the very large magnitude of flood 200502 all spillway gates except the bottom outlets are scheduled during the flood event because there is only one bottom outlet and its opening has the lowest priority the bottom outlet remains closed during this flood event the opening degree of the surface outlets in each time period is shown in fig 9 the opening degree of surface outlet 3 changes a little in adjacent time periods and is effectively maintained at 4 and 5 as the drastic change in water level greatly affects the gate discharge capacity the opening of 2 and 4 has to change frequently to try to maintain a smooth discharge the opening of 1 and 5 also varies frequently however in order to reduce the number of gate openings 1 and 5 are opened only when the opening degree of 2 is greater than 3 this indicates that the introduction of constraints 29 34 means that the rules for gate opening and closing can be strictly observed in summary the above two case studies which include both small and large flood events demonstrate that the developed model can effectively deal with the flood control operation problem for a single reservoir while also considering spillway gate scheduling 3 3 case study 3 comparison with the conventional optimization model conventional optimization models for reservoir flood control operation only optimize the reservoir water discharge but do not distribute the water discharge to the spillway gates which is not accurate and in most cases fails to determine a feasible combination of spillage gates hence in order to highlight the advancement of the developed model a comparison between the optimization results obtained from the developed model and a conventional model is carried out the calculation conditions of the conventional model referred to case study 1 and poa jiang et al 2018 was employed to solve this model the comparison between the outflow and reservoir forebay water level obtained from the proposed model and the conventional model are presented in fig 10 and fig 11 respectively it can be observed that the flood peak and flood range obtained from the two different models are very close however the outflow and reservoir forebay water level obtained from the two models are quite different there are two main reasons for this difference 1 without considering the spillway gate scheduling it is assumed that the spillway gates can be set to any opening degree rather than to a certain number of degrees and the maximum discharge capacity of the gate under a certain water level has not been fully considered thus the obtained outflow is more stable 2 the flood control storage capacity of the gongguoqiao reservoir is small resulting in its forebay water level being very sensitive to the change of outflow based on the actual water discharge curves the actual outflow was recomputed using the forebay water levels obtained from the conventional model a comparison between the actual outflow and the optimal outflow calculated from the proposed model is shown in fig 12 as can be seen the obtained reservoir outflow based on the conventional model is not realistic indicating that the conventional model struggles to directly guide the practical flood control operation of reservoirs this also demonstrates that it is necessary to consider spillway gate scheduling comprehensively in the flood control operation model in order to make the optimization solutions more accurate 3 4 discussion two flood events corresponding to hydrographs of floods with a 100 year and 10 year return period respectively are used as the typical floods to verify the proposed model in each case study we analyze the optimization results from three aspects outflow curve reservoir water level process and gate operation scheme all of which prove that the operation results obtained in this study can effectively relieve the flood control pressure on the downstream and meet the operation constraints moreover in order to highlight the advancement of the developed model a comparison between the optimization results obtained from the developed model and a conventional model without considering spillway gate scheduling is carried out compared with the conventional optimization model the proposed model can produce more realistic and executable flood control operation scheduling therefore it can be proved that the optimal flood control operation studied in this paper is reasonable and advanced the reservoir outflow becomes discontinuous due to the finite number of spillway gate combinations hence there are fluctuations in the outflow curves see fig 4 and fig 7 for flood 200502 the fluctuations are more dramatic than those for flood 201701 moreover the flood detention effect as delay the arrival of the flood peak is not very significant especially for flood 200502 this is mainly because the flood peak and flood volume of the flood 200 502 100 year return period flood event are very large but the regulation performance of the gongguoqiao reservoir is daily and its flood control capacity is insufficient to be honest the flood regulation performanc will be better if only the optimization of reservoir outflow is considered and the comparison between the outflow obtained from the proposed model and that from the conventional model can also prove this see fig 10 this is mainly because when the spillway gate scheduling is not considered it is assumed that the spillway gates can be set to any opening degree rather than to a certain number of degrees and the maximum discharge capacity of the gate under a certain water level has not been fully considered however the obtained reservoir outflow based on the conventional model which does not consider spillway gate scheduling is not realistic and and deviate from the actual flood control operation to a large extent when executed see fig 12 although the developed model is more complex and more difficult to solve we believe that it can produce more realistic and executable flood control operation scheduling compared with the conventional optimization model and is more convenient to guide the practical flood control operation runoff is the most important and indispensable input for the reservoir flood control operation this study mainly focuses on considering the spillway gate scheduling in the reservoir flood control operation model and uses historical flood events to reduce the difficulty of solving the model i e it assumes that flood forecast information is reliable hence the uncertainty of flood forecast information should be considered in future research to further improve the implementability of the flood control operation scheme on the other hand due to the unavoidable forecast error the ideal practical operation process usually does not match with the plan nevertheless the optimization results from the proposed model can provide the operators with good initial operating plans to assist in their decision making hence a reasonable and practical real time flood control operation strategy for reservoirs which consists of efficient model updating algorithms jiang et al 2018 and real time inflow forecast techniques should be proposed to adjust the operation scheme of spillway gates and to avoid or reduce the negative influence caused by runoff forecast uncertainties the better the reservoir regulation performance is the more significant the flood regulation effect will be and the more types and numbers of spillway gates will be however when a large number of spillway gates or more reservoirs are involved in the proposed model the computational efficiency is reduced to some extent and may not meet the timeliness requirements for real time flood control operation hence model decomposition techniques and parallel techniques will be integrated into the solution method to further improve the solution efficiency and increase the engineering application value of the proposed model 4 conclusion this paper proposes an milp based model for reservoir flood control operation taking spillway gate scheduling into consideration the validity of the model is verified by taking the flood control operation of the gongguoqiao reservoir located on the lancang river i e mekong river in southwest china as an example the conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the proposed model can effectively meet the complex operational constraints of the reservoir and spillway gates the influence of the reservoir forebay water level and opening degree on the discharge capacity of the individual spillway gates during the operation periods is also considered which not only refines dispatching but also ensures the safe and stable operation of the reservoir and discharge facilities 2 effective linearization strategies are put forward to deal with the nonlinear factors in the reservoir flood control operation model especially the objective function in the form of maximin the three dimensional water discharge curves and the rules for the opening and closing sequence of the spillway gates for such a complex research problem the milp approach is computationally efficient with the help of superior optimization software 3 the developed optimization model can effectively deal with the very complicated flood control operation problem for floods of different magnitude the flood control pressure on the downstream has been greatly relieved after optimization moreover optimization results obtained from the conventional model which does not consider spillway gate scheduling are significantly different from those obtained from the proposed model and deviate from the actual flood control operation to a large extent when executed thus it is concluded that the proposed model can produce more realistic and executable flood control operation scheduling compared with the conventional optimization model and is more convenient to guide the practical flood control operation of reservoirs credit authorship contribution statement chengguo su methodology writing review editing funding acquisition peilin

2877,reservoir flood control operation is an important and effective measure for avoiding or reducing flood disasters considering that reservoir operation is a control process that essentially manages the spillway gates to increase or decrease the amount of released water this paper focuses on studying the reservoir flood control operation which considers spillway gate scheduling minimizing the peak outflow from the reservoir is adopted as the optimization objective to protect downstream areas from flood disasters in addition to the conventional reservoir constraints the operation constraints of individual spillway gates and the influence of the reservoir forebay water level and opening degree on the gates discharge capacity are also well considered to obtain precise scheduling the nonlinear factors especially the objective function in the form of maximin the three dimensional water discharge curves and the rules for the opening and closing sequence of the spillway gates are linearized through several strategies the original nonlinear and non convex model is then converted into a standard mixed integer linear programming milp formulation the results for the real world case study indicate that 1 the proposed model is believed to be computationally efficient with a calculation time of about 30 min 2 for the flood events with return periods of 10 years and 100 years the flood peaks are reduced from 4160 m3 s to 3681 m3 s and from 11007 m3 s to 9293 m3 s representing decreases of 11 5 and 15 6 respectively the outflow curves become more stable demonstrating that the flood control pressure on the downstream had been relieved after optimization 3 the proposed model can produce more realistic and executable flood control operation scheduling compared with the conventional optimization model without considering spillway gate scheduling these research findings can provide an effective reference for both the operators of reservoirs and researchers in the field of reservoir flood control operation keywords flood control operation spillway gate scheduling gate operation rules water discharge curves mixed integer linear programming data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods are the most important and common natural disaster in the world the economic loss caused by flooding ranks first among many types of disaster and poses a major threat to economic development people s lives and property safety albano et al 2017 apurv et al 2015 arnell and gosling 2016 reservoirs as a control measure with a regulating function play a prominent role in the flood control of rivers by regulating and storing flood water hence the construction and operation of reservoirs in flood control systems has become an important and effective measure for flood control and disaster reduction teng et al 2017 scholars in china and abroad have carried out a lot of research and exploration into the problem of reservoir flood control operation to reduce flood control risk meng et al meng et al 2019 proposed a framework of flood control operation for cascade reservoirs coupled with risk assessment fcora and a corresponding fcora model that contains three sub modules zhang et al zhang et al 2019 studied the real time reservoir flood control operation for cascade reservoirs using a two stage flood risk analysis method li et al li et al 2019 proposed a dynamic and intelligent modeling method for the joint operation of a flood control system which can alleviate the curse of dimensionality by reducing the number of reservoirs for flood control operation lu et al lu et al 2020 proposed a risk analysis model for reservoir flood control operation under two dimensional uncertainties based on bayesian network cuevas velásquez et al cuevas velásquez et al 2020 presented a real time flood control model that brings together the advantages of an optimization model based on mixed integer linear programming milp and a case based learning scheme using bayesian networks chen et al chen et al 2020 developed a multi objective risk management model for real time optimal flood control operation for a parallel reservoir system during flood season considering the uncertainties of reservoir in flows and lateral inflows wan et al wan et al 2021 focused on establishing linkage between flood limited water levels and flood forecasting technology thus developing a dynamic pre storm level approach for reservoir flood control operations zha et al zha et al 2021 proposed an optimization method combining dynamic programming dp progressive optimality algorithm poa and particle swarm optimization pso for the joint flood control operation of large scale reservoirs these studies mainly aim to use optimization algorithms to optimize reservoir operations and provide an optimal policy for flood control however the optimal results for reservoir operations mostly focus on water discharge and do not distribute the water discharge to the spillway gates as the reservoir discharge capacity is not fixed and depends on the combination of spillage gates at the current forebay water level conventional flood control operation which does not consider the optimal control of the spillway gates is not accurate and makes it difficult to directly guide the actual flood control operation considering that reservoir operation is a control process that essentially manages the spillway gates to increase or decrease the amount of released water this paper places emphasis on the optimal reservoir flood control operation considering spillway gate scheduling i e determining the hourly revervoir water level and allocating the total water discharge to each spillway gate the coupling of conventional reservoir constraints the complex rules of spillway gate operation and the influence of the reservoir forebay water level and opening degree on the gates discharge capacity make the reservoir flood control operation problem combined with spillway gate scheduling very challenging for operators and researchers in practical engineering application the reservoir flood control operation problem is adressed first and and each spillway gate s operation status opening degree is then determined based on the optimized forebay water level and total water discharge of the reservoir the trial and error methods are usually performed but it takes a large amount of time and is difficult to obtain ideal results at present there are few studies on reservoir operation for flood control which consider the combination of spillway gates chen et al chen et al 2016 established a floodgate combination table to distribute specific reservoir discharge to the floodgates based on the water discharge distribution principle and proposed a multi step progressive optimality algorithm for optimal floodgate operation in cascade reservoirs however when the water level of the reservoir fluctuates greatly and there are many spillway gates in the reservoir there may be a large number of floodgate combination schemes for a certain outflow in the floodgate table resulting in a very low search efficiency bagis and karaboga bagis and karaboga 2007 developed an evolutionary algorithm based fuzzy proportional derivative pd type controller for the real time control of spillway gates during the flood season karaboga et al karaboga et al 2008 proposed an operation method based on fuzzy logic control to automatically realize the operation of the spillway gates of the catalan dam in turkey feng and liu feng and liu 2014 proposed a mixed integer linear programming milp model to optimize the spillway gate scheduling i e determine the index of opened spillway gates and the opening degree of each spillway gate for reservoir flood control liu et al liu et al 2017 used poa to determine the multi objective reservoir operation during flood season considering spillway optimization and a smooth support vector machine model was then applied to abstract the optimal operation rules which consider the order and the number of spillways kim et al kim et al 2021 introduced a novel optimization method based on the pso algorithm combined with the rearrangement method of the particle solution groups to directly determine the optimal operation rules of the reservoir floodgates however their models all take one day as the scheduling period which is not accurate enough moreover they assume that individual spillway gates are either closed or fully open and the opening degree of spillway gates is not considered which makes the models less universally applicable flood control operation which considers the combination of spillway gates is a typical mixed integer nonlinear programming minlp problem and is very difficult to solve due to its non convex nonlinear and noncontinuous features belotti et al 2013 at present the conventional methods for reservoir operation including dp he et al 2021 poa jiang et al 2018 linear programming lp brandão 2010 nonlinear programming nlp huang et al 2019 and modern intelligent algorithms e g genetic algorithm shang et al 2017 and pso lu et al 2020 he et al 2014 all have great difficulties in solving this problem for example dp and poa are prone to the dimensional disaster problem when the number of spillway gates is large the lp and nlp methods cannot consider the status of individual spillway gates and thus are not suitable for dealing with the present problem modern intelligent algorithms are simple and widely adaptable but the stability of the results cannot be guaranteed strictly because of their stochastic optimization characteristics and they easily fall into local optimal solutions when very complex problems are encountered with the development of optimization software the milp approach is becoming more and more mature and has been widely used in reservoir operation because of its excellent performance in handling very complex constraints cuevas velásquez et al 2020 feng and liu 2014 su et al 2020 lu et al 2021 generally global or near global optimal results can be obtained within an acceptable solving time finardi et al 2016 ramos et al 2015 considering the above issues this paper focuses on developing an milp based optimization model for reservoir flood control operation which considers spillway gate scheduling the model aims to protect downstream areas from flood disasters by minimizing the peak outflow from the reservoir in order to speed up the solution time and obtain the global optimal solution the original nonlinear and non convex model is converted into a standard milp formulation through several linearization strategies the rationality and validity of the proposed model are verified by taking the flood control operation of the gongguoqiao reservoir located on the lancang river i e mekong river in southwest china as an example compared with the existing research the main contributions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 the optimal reservoir flood control operation considering spillway gate scheduling is studied in this paper in addition to the conventional reservoir constraints the operation constraints of individual spillway gates and the influence of the reservoir forebay water level and opening degree on the gates discharge capacity are also well considered making the optimization model and obtained flood control operation scheduling more refined 2 the nonlinear relationship between the water discharge reservoir forebay water level and opening degree of each spillway gate is represented by water discharge curves which are drawn based on the historical measured data a novel technique is then proposed to linearize the three dimensional water discharge curves 3 the optimization results obtained from the realistic case studies demonstrate that the proposed model is computationally efficient and produces more realistic and executable flood control operation scheduling than the conventional optimization model which does not consider spillway gate scheduling the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 establishes the mathematical formulation for the present problem and linearization strategies for the nonlinear objective functions and constraints are proposed the optimization results of the real world case studies are presented and discussed in section 3 finally conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 objective function the goal of the reservoir flood control is to ensure the safety of the dam and satisfy the downstream flood control requirements as dam safety can be achieved by limiting the highest reservoir level and the reservoirs have a responsibility to protect downstream areas from flood disasters minimizing the peak outflow from the reservoir is adopted as the objective of this study the objective function is presented as below 1 f min max 1 t t q t where t is the total number of time periods t is the index of time periods q t denotes the total water discharge of the reservoir in time period t in m3 s it should be noted that the local inflow of the flood control section located downstream is is not considered in this model 2 2 constraints the flood control constraints are presented as below a reservoir constraints 1 water balance constraints 2 v t v t 1 3600 i t q t δ t 3 q t q t p q t f q t p i 1 i q i t where i t denotes the forecasted reservoir inflow in time period t in m3 s δ t is the duration of period t and is set to 1 h in this model v t denotes the water storage of the reservoir at the end of time period t in m3 q t f denotes the water released from all of the spillways in m3 s q t p denotes the generating water flow i e the water released from all of the turbines in m3 s i and i represent the set and index of the spillways in the reservoir respectively q i t denotes the water discharge of spillway i in time period t in m3 s considering that hydropower plants usually operate at maximum capacity during the flood season in order to make full use of hydropower resources q t p is set to q max p i e the maximum generating water flow of the hydropower plant during the whole scheduling period for the sake of simplicity 2 water storage constraints 4 v min v t v max 5 v 0 v b v t v e where v max and v min denote the upper and lower bounds of the water storage of the reservoir respectively in m3 v b denotes the initial water storage of the reservoir in m3 v e denotes the target water storage of the reservoir at the end of the scheduling horizon in m3 3 water discharge constraints 6 q min q t q max 7 ε q t q t 1 ε where q min and q max denote the minimum and maximum total water discharge respectively in period t in m3 s ε is the maximum allowable variation of reservoir discharge in adjacent periods in m3 s constraints 6 and 7 are used to ensure the comprehensive water demand and flood control safety of the downstream b individual spillway gate constraints 1 water discharge limits 8 0 q i t u i t q i m a x where q i m a x denotes the maximum allowable water discharge of spillway i in m3 s u i t is a binary variable that is equal to 1 if the ith spillway gate is in open status in time period t but is equal to 0 otherwise 2 constraints on open and closed duration generally speaking the shorter the opening and closing time of the spillway gates the more flexible the gate operation and the better the flood control effect of the reservoir however the frequent opening and closing of the spillway gates will significantly increase the operation cost of the reservoir and affect the service life of the gate control system hence the minimum required open and closed durations of each spillway gate are set to 3 h in this model 9 x i t η t 1 t α i 1 y i η 1 y i t η t 1 t β i 1 x i η 1 x i t y i t 0 1 10 x i t y i t u i t u i t 1 x i t y i t 1 where x i t and y i t are 0 1 indicator variables if spillway gate i is opened in time period t x i t is equal to 1 otherwise it is equal to 0 if spillway gate i is closed in time period t y i t is equal to 1 otherwise it is equal to 0 α i and β i denote the minimum required open and closed durations of spillway gate i in h respectively the current status of the spillway gates can have a significant impact on the spillway gate scheduling in this paper we assume that all spillway gates are closed before the arrival of the flood events and their closed duration is in line with the minimum required closed duration and the reservoir can release water by the turbines in the hydropower plant 3 water discharge function 11 q i t f i q z o i t z t 1 z t 2 12 z t f zv v t 13 o i t 1 m u i t 1 o i t m 1 u i t where o i t denotes the opening degree of spillway gate i in time period t it should be noted that the opening degree is usually limited to several specific numbers in practical engineering applications such as 1 2 and 3 to prevent the spillway gates from being adjusted too frequently f i q z denotes the relative function between the water discharge the opening degree of spillway gate i and the forebay water level of the reservoir f zv represents the relation function between the water level and water storage of the reservoir m is a very large positive number constraint 13 represents the relationship between the opening and closing statuses and the opening degree of the spillway gates when spillway gate i is open in period t i e u i t 1 o i t 1 otherwise o i t 0 4 rules for gate opening and closing a reservoir that undertakes the task of flood control usually has a variety of spillways such as surface outlets and bottom outlets we suppose that the numbers of surface outlets and bottom outlets are i 1 and i 2 respectively 1 to avoid severe vibration of the spillway gates and ensure the safety of the dam the spillway gates are required to open or close symmetrically this symmetry rules can be described as follows 14 o m t s o m 1 t s o m 1 t s o m 2 t s o 1 t s o 2 m t s if i 1 2 m m 1 2 3 15 o m 1 t s o m 1 t s o m 2 t s o m 2 t s o 1 t s o 2 m 1 t s if i 1 2 m 1 m 1 2 3 16 o n t b o n 1 t b o n 1 t b o n 2 t b o 1 t b o 2 n t b if i 2 2 n n 1 2 3 17 o n 1 t b o n 1 t b o n 2 t b o n 2 t b o 1 t b o 2 n 1 t b if i 2 2 n 1 n 1 2 3 where o m t s and o n t b denote the opening degrees of surface outlet m and bottom outlet n respectively 2 the spillway gates usually have a specific opening and closing sequence for example opening the middle gates has a higher priority than opening the side gates and the surface outlets have a higher priority than the bottom outlets because the long term operation of the bottom outlets will have a negative impact on the slope of the downstream river and buildings moreover the closing priorities of these gates have the opposite order the opening and closing sequence of the spillway gates is shown as follows 18 p o m t s p o m 1 t s p o 1 t s p o n t b p o n 1 t b p o 1 t b where p denotes the opening priorities of the spillway gates 2 3 milp model formulation in the above model eq 1 contains a function of the minimax form which is nonlinear eq 11 is a function of two variables which represents the nonlinear relationship between the water discharge opening degree of the spillway gates and the reservoir water level the relationship between water level and water storage i e eq 12 is also usually a nonlinear function eq 18 contains the abstract mapping relationship between gate type gate position and gate opening and closing priority to sum up there are four nonlinear factors in the above model i e eqs 1 11 12 and 18 which need to be linearized so that the original minlp model can be transformed into an milp model that meets the accuracy requirements then a mature and efficient optimization solver can be used for solving the milp model considering that there have been many literatures on the linearization of the relationship between water level and water storage tong et al 2013 cheng et al 2018 this section mainly focuses on linearizing the objective function and the water discharge function of the spillways 2 3 1 linearization of the objective function firstly one auxiliary variable q is introduced which needs to satisfy eq 19 19 q t q t 1 t then eq 1 can be translated into eq 20 20 f min q since eqs 19 and 20 are linear the objective function can be linearized through eqs 19 and 20 2 3 2 linear approximation of the water discharge function of the spillway gates as shown in eq 11 the water discharge of each spillway is determined jointly by its opening degree and the reservoir water level a precise modelling of the water discharge function requires finite element analysis chen et al 2020 defina and susin 2003 in actual engineering applications the water discharge function of the spillways is usually described by a series of nonlinear curves based on the historical measured data as shown in fig 1 which are called water discharge curves each curve represents the relationship between the water discharge and opening degree of the spillway gates under a specified reservoir water level based on the water discharge curves a novel linear formulation for the water discharge function of spillways is presented in this subsection within the maximum and minimum possible water level range during the scheduling horizon three curves representing the relationship between water discharge and the opening degree of the spillway gate are selected corresponding to high z h medium z m and low z l reservoir water levels respectively as shown in fig 1 the opening degree is usually limited to several specific numbers in practical engineering applications the opening degrees of spillway gate i are limited to k levels which are marked with dotted lines in fig 1 accordingly the water discharge can be formulated using the following linear constraints 21 r i k t 0 1 k 1 2 k 22 k 1 k r i k t u i t 23 λ i k t v 0 v 1 2 3 a n d k 1 2 k 24 v 1 3 λ i k t v r i k t 25 z t z t 1 2 k 1 k v 1 3 λ i k t v z i k v 26 z t z t 1 2 k 1 k v 1 3 λ i k t v z i k v m 1 u i t 27 o i t k 1 k v 1 3 λ i k t v o i k v 28 q i t k 1 k v 1 3 λ i k t v q i k v where k is the index of the opening degree v is the index of the intersections of the three water level lines and a specific opening degree line z i k v o i k v and q i k v denote the reservoir water level opening degree and water discharge of spillway i at the vth intersection under opening degree k respectively r i k t is a binary variable and when r i k t is equal to 1 it means that the opening degree of spillway gate i in time period t is k λ i j t l v denotes the weighting coefficient of the vth intersection corresponding to opening degree k in time period t eqs 21 22 force spillway gate i to be kept open at only a single opening degree in time period t eqs 23 24 indicate that if the opening degree of spillway gate i is k i e r i k t 1 the sum of the weighting coefficients of its three intersections is equal to 1 otherwise the weighting coefficients are all 0 eqs 25 26 are used to interpolate the reservoir water level if spillway gate i in time period t is in open status the reservoir water level must be equal to the sum of the weighted water level of each intersection otherwise eqs 25 and 26 are invalid similarly eqs 27 and 28 calculate the interpolation value for the opening degree and water discharge respectively in fact the weighing coefficients of each intersection can be calculated through eqs 21 27 and when these coefficients are determined the interpolated value for water discharge is then uniquely determined by eq 28 2 3 3 linearization of the rules for the opening and closing sequence of the spillway gates two auxiliary binary variables γ a t s and γ b t b are introduced and eq 18 can then be converted into the following linear constraints 29 γ a t s γ b t b 0 1 30 o a t s n m γ a t s a 1 2 i 1 31 n o a t s m 1 γ a t s 32 o b t b g m γ b t b b 1 2 i 2 33 g o b t b m 1 γ b t b 34 u m 1 t s m γ m t s u m 2 t s m γ m 1 t s u 1 t s m γ 2 t s u n t b m γ 1 t s u n 1 t b m γ n t b u n 2 t b m γ n 1 t b u 1 t b m γ 2 t b where γ a t s and γ b t b are binary indicator variables n and g are the thresholds for the opening degree of the surface outlets and the bottom outlets respectively eqs 29 33 can ensure that if the opening degree of surface outlet a reaches n then γ a t s 1 otherwise γ a t s 0 if the opening degree of bottom outlet b reaches g then γ b t b 1 otherwise γ b t b 0 eq 34 ensures that the spillway gates with lower priority can only be opened when the opening degree of the gates with higher priority reaches n g in order to minimize the number of gate openings 2 3 4 complete model

optimization solvers such as gurobi cplex and lingo 8 output optimization results including the forebay water level of the reservoir and the opening degree of each spillway gate 3 case studies the proposed model was applied to the flood control operation of the gongguoqiao reservoir located on the lancang river i e mekong river in southwest china to verify its rationality and validity the gongguoqiao reservoir is the most upstream hydropower plant in the middle and lower reaches of the lancang river and plays an important role in flood control power generation and irrigation the characteristics of the reservoir are presented in table 1 the gongguoqiao reservoir contains three types of spillways turbines surface outlets and bottom outlets it should be noted that the turbines are considered as spillways because of their flood discharge capacity and the discharge through the turbines during the flood events was set as the maximum discharge to make full use of available water resources for power generation the characteristics of various types of spillways are shown in table 2 and two kinds of operation constraints should be considered in spillway scheduling 1 the water discharge of each individual spillway depends on its type and opening degree as well as the reservoir water level the water discharge curves of different types of spillways are presented in fig 2 2 the spillway gates should be operated in a specific order which is described as follows 1 the spillway gates should be opened in the following order turbines surface outlets bottom outlets they should be closed in the reverse order 2 the opening of each surface outlet is set to one of five levels a gate with a lower priority can only be opened when the opening of a higher priority gate is greater than level 3 3 the spillway gates should be operated symmetrically to ensure that the water discharge can be distributed evenly along the dams to verify the validity of the model for dealing with floods of different magnitudes two flood events which occurred in 2005 named 200502 and 2017 named 201701 corresponding to hydrographs of floods with a 100 year and 10 year return period are used as the typical floods the details of the two flood events are shown in fig 3 the initial and target forebay water levels of the reservoir refer to the actual historical operational data in the case studies 1 h was taken as the time period the model was solved by gurobi optimizer which is developed by gurobi optimization company and is a powerful mathematical optimization solver for a variety of mathematical programming problems including lp quadratic programming qp quadratically constrained programming qcp milp mixed integer quadratic programming miqp and mixed integer quadratically constrained programming miqcp gurobi optimizer reference manual 2020 due to its excellent computing performance it has been widely used in power system scheduling manufacturing finance and other fields all tests were performed on a thinkpad pc with 16 gb of ram and quad core cpu the optimized total water discharge of the gongguoqiao reservoir in case study 1 and case study 2 were 3681 m3 s and 9293 m3 s respectively as shown in table 3 the corresponding calculation times were 1745 s and 2248 s respectively although there is only one single reservoir involved in the case studies solving the problem is still challenging due to the consideration of the spillway gate scheduling and the relatively long scheduling cycle for such a large scale problem the computation time of about 30 min is acceptable and meets the timeliness requirement of the flood control of the gongguoqiao reservoir detailed flood control scheduling of the gongguoqiao reservoir is presented in the following section 3 1 case study 1 optimal flood control operation for flood 201701 optimization results for the flood control operation of the gongguoqiao reservoir in case study 1 are illustrated in fig 4 the characteristic indexes of the flood event before and after optimization are shown in table 4 where range ratio denotes the ratio of range to peak value it can be seen that the outflow process becomes more stable after the optimal flood control operation of the gongguoqiao reservoir the flood peak and flood range have been reduced from 4160 m3 s to 3681 m3 s and from 1566 m3 s to 476 m3 s with decreases of 11 5 and 69 6 respectively at the same time the range ratio and the standard deviation of the flood process also decreased indicating that the outflow curve became more stable and that the flood control pressure on the downstream had been relieved after optimization fig 5 shows the forebay water level of the gongguoqiao reservoir in case study 1 it can be observed that the water level of the reservoir can satisfy the upper and lower limits which can guarantee the safety of the dam the water level at the end of the scheduling horizon was 1304 65 m and therefore meets the control requirements moreover the water level varies greatly during the operation period due to its relatively poor regulation performance therefore the influence of the change in reservoir water level on the water discharge of the spillway gates cannot be ignored due to the small magnitude of flood 201701 the gongguoqiao reservoir has sufficient flood control storage and thus only one surface outlet 3 is opened the opening degree of surface outlet 3 in each time period is shown in fig 6 the scheduling of the spillway gates is in accordance with the reservoir gate operation rules moreover the opening degree of surface outlet 3 changes a little in adjacent time periods and does not open and close frequently 3 2 case study 2 optimal flood control operation for flood 200502 flood event 200101 is significantly different compared to flood 201 901 in terms of flood magnitude flood peak and duration thus it is necessary to test the validity of the developed model when applied to the flood control operation for flood 200502 optimization results for the flood control operation of the gongguoqiao reservoir in case study 2 are presented in fig 7 and table 5 the flood peak and flood range have been reduced from 11007 m3 s to 9293 m3 s and from 7227 m3 s to 3804 m3 s with decreases of 15 6 and 47 4 respectively the range ratio and the standard deviation of the flood process are reduced by 37 7 and 34 9 respectively this demonstrates that the optimization results of the flood control operation for flood 200 502 are also reasonable and acceptable the reservoir forebay water level in case study 2 is shown in fig 8 as can be seen the water level water storage of the gongguoqiao reservoir is constantly adjusted to minimize the flood peak and ensure downstream safety but it never breaches its upper and lower limits due to the very large magnitude of flood 200502 all spillway gates except the bottom outlets are scheduled during the flood event because there is only one bottom outlet and its opening has the lowest priority the bottom outlet remains closed during this flood event the opening degree of the surface outlets in each time period is shown in fig 9 the opening degree of surface outlet 3 changes a little in adjacent time periods and is effectively maintained at 4 and 5 as the drastic change in water level greatly affects the gate discharge capacity the opening of 2 and 4 has to change frequently to try to maintain a smooth discharge the opening of 1 and 5 also varies frequently however in order to reduce the number of gate openings 1 and 5 are opened only when the opening degree of 2 is greater than 3 this indicates that the introduction of constraints 29 34 means that the rules for gate opening and closing can be strictly observed in summary the above two case studies which include both small and large flood events demonstrate that the developed model can effectively deal with the flood control operation problem for a single reservoir while also considering spillway gate scheduling 3 3 case study 3 comparison with the conventional optimization model conventional optimization models for reservoir flood control operation only optimize the reservoir water discharge but do not distribute the water discharge to the spillway gates which is not accurate and in most cases fails to determine a feasible combination of spillage gates hence in order to highlight the advancement of the developed model a comparison between the optimization results obtained from the developed model and a conventional model is carried out the calculation conditions of the conventional model referred to case study 1 and poa jiang et al 2018 was employed to solve this model the comparison between the outflow and reservoir forebay water level obtained from the proposed model and the conventional model are presented in fig 10 and fig 11 respectively it can be observed that the flood peak and flood range obtained from the two different models are very close however the outflow and reservoir forebay water level obtained from the two models are quite different there are two main reasons for this difference 1 without considering the spillway gate scheduling it is assumed that the spillway gates can be set to any opening degree rather than to a certain number of degrees and the maximum discharge capacity of the gate under a certain water level has not been fully considered thus the obtained outflow is more stable 2 the flood control storage capacity of the gongguoqiao reservoir is small resulting in its forebay water level being very sensitive to the change of outflow based on the actual water discharge curves the actual outflow was recomputed using the forebay water levels obtained from the conventional model a comparison between the actual outflow and the optimal outflow calculated from the proposed model is shown in fig 12 as can be seen the obtained reservoir outflow based on the conventional model is not realistic indicating that the conventional model struggles to directly guide the practical flood control operation of reservoirs this also demonstrates that it is necessary to consider spillway gate scheduling comprehensively in the flood control operation model in order to make the optimization solutions more accurate 3 4 discussion two flood events corresponding to hydrographs of floods with a 100 year and 10 year return period respectively are used as the typical floods to verify the proposed model in each case study we analyze the optimization results from three aspects outflow curve reservoir water level process and gate operation scheme all of which prove that the operation results obtained in this study can effectively relieve the flood control pressure on the downstream and meet the operation constraints moreover in order to highlight the advancement of the developed model a comparison between the optimization results obtained from the developed model and a conventional model without considering spillway gate scheduling is carried out compared with the conventional optimization model the proposed model can produce more realistic and executable flood control operation scheduling therefore it can be proved that the optimal flood control operation studied in this paper is reasonable and advanced the reservoir outflow becomes discontinuous due to the finite number of spillway gate combinations hence there are fluctuations in the outflow curves see fig 4 and fig 7 for flood 200502 the fluctuations are more dramatic than those for flood 201701 moreover the flood detention effect as delay the arrival of the flood peak is not very significant especially for flood 200502 this is mainly because the flood peak and flood volume of the flood 200 502 100 year return period flood event are very large but the regulation performance of the gongguoqiao reservoir is daily and its flood control capacity is insufficient to be honest the flood regulation performanc will be better if only the optimization of reservoir outflow is considered and the comparison between the outflow obtained from the proposed model and that from the conventional model can also prove this see fig 10 this is mainly because when the spillway gate scheduling is not considered it is assumed that the spillway gates can be set to any opening degree rather than to a certain number of degrees and the maximum discharge capacity of the gate under a certain water level has not been fully considered however the obtained reservoir outflow based on the conventional model which does not consider spillway gate scheduling is not realistic and and deviate from the actual flood control operation to a large extent when executed see fig 12 although the developed model is more complex and more difficult to solve we believe that it can produce more realistic and executable flood control operation scheduling compared with the conventional optimization model and is more convenient to guide the practical flood control operation runoff is the most important and indispensable input for the reservoir flood control operation this study mainly focuses on considering the spillway gate scheduling in the reservoir flood control operation model and uses historical flood events to reduce the difficulty of solving the model i e it assumes that flood forecast information is reliable hence the uncertainty of flood forecast information should be considered in future research to further improve the implementability of the flood control operation scheme on the other hand due to the unavoidable forecast error the ideal practical operation process usually does not match with the plan nevertheless the optimization results from the proposed model can provide the operators with good initial operating plans to assist in their decision making hence a reasonable and practical real time flood control operation strategy for reservoirs which consists of efficient model updating algorithms jiang et al 2018 and real time inflow forecast techniques should be proposed to adjust the operation scheme of spillway gates and to avoid or reduce the negative influence caused by runoff forecast uncertainties the better the reservoir regulation performance is the more significant the flood regulation effect will be and the more types and numbers of spillway gates will be however when a large number of spillway gates or more reservoirs are involved in the proposed model the computational efficiency is reduced to some extent and may not meet the timeliness requirements for real time flood control operation hence model decomposition techniques and parallel techniques will be integrated into the solution method to further improve the solution efficiency and increase the engineering application value of the proposed model 4 conclusion this paper proposes an milp based model for reservoir flood control operation taking spillway gate scheduling into consideration the validity of the model is verified by taking the flood control operation of the gongguoqiao reservoir located on the lancang river i e mekong river in southwest china as an example the conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the proposed model can effectively meet the complex operational constraints of the reservoir and spillway gates the influence of the reservoir forebay water level and opening degree on the discharge capacity of the individual spillway gates during the operation periods is also considered which not only refines dispatching but also ensures the safe and stable operation of the reservoir and discharge facilities 2 effective linearization strategies are put forward to deal with the nonlinear factors in the reservoir flood control operation model especially the objective function in the form of maximin the three dimensional water discharge curves and the rules for the opening and closing sequence of the spillway gates for such a complex research problem the milp approach is computationally efficient with the help of superior optimization software 3 the developed optimization model can effectively deal with the very complicated flood control operation problem for floods of different magnitude the flood control pressure on the downstream has been greatly relieved after optimization moreover optimization results obtained from the conventional model which does not consider spillway gate scheduling are significantly different from those obtained from the proposed model and deviate from the actual flood control operation to a large extent when executed thus it is concluded that the proposed model can produce more realistic and executable flood control operation scheduling compared with the conventional optimization model and is more convenient to guide the practical flood control operation of reservoirs credit authorship contribution statement chengguo su methodology writing review editing funding acquisition peilin

2878,accurate evapotranspiration et measurements are fundamental for improving the understanding of water energy related processes and for validating model simulations however et is inherently difficult to measure unambiguously the surface renewal sr method which describes the turbulence exchange process from a new perspective has been successfully applied within affordable costs from crops to tall forest canopies however the sr method with its significant practical potential remains uncommon in measuring et likely because a semiempirical calibration coefficient α is needed therefore this study evaluates the performance of the sr method without any calibration and compares et measurements between the sr and bowen ratio br methods to test which method is more robust the results from a two year experiment at an arid vineyard show the following factors 1 daily et estimates by the sr method et sr without calibration α 1 agree well with those from the br method et br with determination coefficient r2 mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percent error mape values of 0 83 0 41 mm d 0 57 mm d and 22 22 respectively 2 compared to et br et sr values calibrated using a α of 1 2 et sr α 1 2 contained the least error in terms of mae 0 38 mm d and mape 19 64 followed by et sr α 1 3 and et sr α 1 1 without a significant difference 3 et br measurements were affected by abnormal br value rejection criteria with wider rejection ranges associated with more significant differences between the et br and et sr measurements and 4 61 of br values calculated from the sr based fluxes were distributed in the range of 1 1 whereas a maximum of 43 were in the same range based on br measurements under various abnormal br rejection criteria for the studied grapevine canopies the uncalibrated sr method is more robust than the br method and it is easy economic and accurate for practical application keywords evapotranspiration surface renewal method bowen ratio energy balance method vineyard data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a water phase change process from liquid or ice to gas including transpiration from vegetation and evaporation from water surfaces soil etc at a global scale multiyear et equals precipitation with a value of approximately 500 103 km y of which terrestrial et is approximately 70 103 km y and accounts for 60 of land precipitation oki kanae 2006 trenberth et al 2007 and the ratio can be greater than 90 in arid regions shen chen 2010 moreover et consumes approximately half of the incoming net radiation absorbed by the land surface trenberth et al 2009 therefore as a crucial flux linking the hydrological cycle and energy processes accurate observation of et is important for understanding the water energy nexus and land atmosphere feedbacks as well as for managing irrigation and water resources wang dickinson 2012 fisher et al 2017 blatchford et al 2019 however et is inherently difficult to measure unambiguously sivapalan 2003 because the et process is affected and controlled by environmental biophysical combined factors tan et al 2019 liu et al 2022 nonetheless in situ et can be measured indirectly based on theories of mass balance e g lysimeter or boundary layer meteorology e g the eddy covariance ec technique and the bowen ratio energy balance breb method which has been reviewed previously such as verstraeten et al 2008 allen et al 2011 wang dickinson 2012 and liu et al 2022 although the ec technique has been widely adopted for measuring et in various ecosystems over the global fluxnet baldocchi 2008 2014 the ec method encounters a commonly reported problem energy balance enclosure mauder et al 2020 ukkola et al 2022 moreover ec systems and lysimeters are costly and require professional maintenance and they are usually used in scientific research despite requiring less maintenance and costing approximately 15 of the cost of the ec system the breb method requires a homogeneous land surface without advection and encounters singularity estimates when the bowen ratio approaches 1 perez et al 1999 maruyama et al 2019 hicks et al 2020 limiting its application because accurate et observation is fundamental for improving water energy related learning observation methods with affordable cost should be developed to benefit farmers and early researchers lack funding the surface renewal sr method is an alternative to measure et because temperature sensors are mainly required and they are much easier to operate and more affordable compared to other methods such as the breb sr theory is based on the concept that gas and liquid molecules are transported by turbulent eddies it was first proposed by higbie 1935 and applied in chemistry in the 1990 s paw u et al 1992 1995 introduced and revised the sr method to measure sensible heat flux h over land surfaces by assuming that an air parcel would be replaced by a new parcel in the turbulence exchange process and heat would be added throughout the parcel height thus scalar exchange between surfaces and the atmosphere could be traced via high frequency temperatures paw u et al 1995 thereafter the sr method was promoted to practical applications in estimating latent heat flux and et via energy balance residual approaches snyder et al 1996 2008 hu et al 2018 the sr method is first used to calculate h using either of the following approaches 1 one scale ramp based classical structure function analysis paw u et al 1995 snyder et al 1996 2 two scale ramp based structure function analysis shapland et al 2012a shapland et al 2012b and 3 monin obukhov similarity theory most analysis castellvi 2004 the difference between the first and the second sr method is that an independent method such as ec or breb is required to determine a semiempirical calibration coefficient in the former paw u et al 1995 whereas the latter only requires high frequency temperature observations without any calibration shapland et al 2012a the most based third method requires additional measurements to estimate h such as wind speed which also complicates the application castellví 2018 the sr method with varied approaches for solving h has been tested and successfully applied in measuring et mainly to support crop irrigation such as snyder et al 2008 shapland et al 2012c moratiel and martínez cob 2013 suvočarev et al 2014 and pozníková et al 2018 the method is applicable not only for various crops from cotton rice and wheat to wine grape and orange orchard but also for tall forest canopies in both stable and unstable conditions with accuracy comparable to the ec method e g spano et al 2000 shapland et al 2012c suvočarev et al 2014 mekhmandarov et al 2015 savage 2017 and summarized in paw u et al 2005 and hu et al 2018 nonetheless the sr method has been mainly applied in california usa italy spain chile and israel considering that the sr method has high accuracy and significant potential in daily et measurement but remains uncommon in application the objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the sr method in addition the sr theory is different from those applied in the ec and br methods which may benefit et studies from a new perspective the ultimate goals are to identify the effects of coefficient calibration and uncalibration on et measurements in the sr method and to determine which measurement is better and more robust in terms of quality sr or br 2 description of field experiment and et measurements 2 1 experimental site and field observations the experiment was conducted at a vineyard 106 1 44 66 e 38 14 17 54 n altitude 1143 m near yinchuang city ningxia hui autonomous region northwest china fig 1 it is a continental temperate climate with a mean annual air temperature precipitation and pan evaporation of 9 c 200 mm and 1250 mm respectively in the study region grapevine is normally planted in late april and the sprouting flowering and fruit set fruit inflation maturity and defoliation stages of grapevines are late april to 20 may 21 may to early july early july to early august middle august to end of august and early september to early october respectively vines in the vineyard vitis vinifera l cv moldova were 7 years old and had row and vine spacings of 3 5 m and 0 5 m respectively the soil had a sandy loam texture with light gray calcium a mean bulk density of 1 5 g cm3 and a field capacity of approximately 13 in the 0 80 cm layer the grapevines with an average height of approximately 1 5 m at their mature stage were arranged on a vertical plane by iron wires at three levels with heights of approximately 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m respectively supported by a 2 m high single trellis system oriented northwest to southeast fig 1b irrigation consisted of an initial flood irrigation at the start of the season followed by periodic drip irrigation approximately every 20 days until maturity a br system was installed in the middle of the vineyard to measure meteorological data in august 2017 the system included a net radiometer nr lite kipp zonen netherlands at a height of 2 m approximately 0 5 m above the canopy temperature and humidity sensors hmp155a vaisala finland at heights of 2 and 2 5 m respectively and two soil heat flux plates hfp01 hukseflux netherlands at depths of 8 cm underground fig 1 and table 1 the system was powered by solar panels sensors were sampled every 5 s and 10 min statistics were recorded automatically by a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc usa these measurements were used to estimate et using the br method see section 2 2 for details from late june 2018 through late october 2019 two thermocouples fw3 campbell scientific inc usa were deployed at a height of approximately 2 25 m thermocouple temperatures were recorded at high frequency 10 hz and were used to estimate sensible heat flux with the sr method see section 2 3 for details then et was estimated by the energy balance residual 2 2 bowen ratio energy balance method the breb method is a typical technique for indirectly measuring et based on the simplified surface energy balance equation in the breb the bowen ratio β is used to divide the available energy between the latent heat le and sensible heat h fluxes β can be estimated using the measured meteorological data with vertical gradients eq 1 1 β h le γ δ t δ e where γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 δt is the air temperature ta difference c between the two measured heights and δe is the difference in actual water vapor pressure kpa γ can be calculated using atmospheric press p in kpa or elevation above sea level h in m eq 2 whereas the actual water vapor pressure can be calculated using relative humidity rh and the saturation vapor pressure estimated from air temperature ta eq 3 according to fao paper 56 allen et al 1998 2 γ 0 665

heat flux w m 2 respectively and l is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 which is set to a constant of 2 49 106 the sensible heat flux h is determined by eq 5 as follows 5 h br β r n g 1 β in this study rn g and δt were obtained directly from the flux tower observations 2 3 surface renewal method the sr method is based on the concept of air parcels periodically coming in contact with a surface exchanging mass or energy with the surface and then being replaced paw u et al 1995 this concept results in ramp like structures in high frequency temperature measurements which can be used to estimate the surface air exchange because the temperature change rate with time of air parcels is directly related to sensible heat flux the average heating of the air parcel and the number of times the air parcel is renewed over a sampling period are used to estimate the sensible heat flux for that period eq 6 paw u et al 1995 6 h sr α z ρ c p a τ where α is the calibration coefficient z is the temperature measurement height m ρ is the air density g m 3 c p is the specific heat of air at constant pressure j g 1 k 1 a is the average ramp amplitude k and τ the ramp period s is the mean air parcel renewal time over the sampling period in this study a was estimated by solving for the real roots of the following cubic equation eq 7 van atta 1977 containing the 2nd 3rd and 5th order structure functions as described in shapland et al 2012c and pozníková et al 2018 7 a 3 10 s 2 r s 5 r s 3 r a 10 s 3 r 0 where sn r is the n th order structure function n 2 3 5 and can be obtained from the high frequency air temperature observation 8 s n r 1 m j i 1 j m t i t i j n where ti and ti j are high frequency temperature measurements from the thermocouple between two sequential time lags m is the number of temperature points in the 10 min interval measured at a sample frequency f of 10 hz in this study and r the ratio of the sample lag interval j to f is the structure function time lag and is set as 0 5 s in this study thereafter τ can be determined by eq 9 9 τ r a 3 s 3 r the calibration coefficient α was set to 1 for initial computations but was varied over a range of 0 8 to 1 5 in a subsequent sensitivity analysis see section 4 2 for details then et at a 10 min scale was determined as a residual of the surface energy balance equation 10 e t sr r n g h sr l 2 4 data processing and statistical assessment for the breb method daytime 7 00 19 00 gmt 8 10 min average et values et 10min were calculated from 10 min observations according to equations in section 2 2 ten minute periods with negative et values or with β falling outside the range specified in eq 11 perez et al 1999 were considered abnormal and were removed from the data set the removed data were replaced by interpolated values using the linear interpolation method next daily et values were accumulated using the et 10min measurements during 7 00 19 00 gmt 8 the quality of each daily et value was assessed according to the proportion of valid data during the day and was classified into five categories table 2 analog to the nash sutcliffe coefficient nash sutcliffe 1970 monthly seasonal and annual et values were accumulated from these daily et values 11 1 ε β 1 ε where ε is the error interval and it is defined as 0 019 δe for the sr method instantaneous h values were first estimated by the high frequency temperature based on eq 6 and instantaneous et values by eq 10 considering the purpose of comparing et values between the breb and sr methods the negative instantaneous daytime et values from the sr method were also classified invalid and deleted thereafter invalid et values were obtained from linear interpolation and daily ets were summarized from the instantaneous ets with the same process as mentioned in the breb calculation finally intact daytime datasets i e each 10 min data point without any missing observations were used for comparison the mean absolute error mae mean absolute percent error mape root mean square error rmse and determine coefficient r2 were used for further analysis 3 results 3 1 et measurements et br from the breb fig 2 shows the statistics of et values from the breb method at the 10 min period hereinafter instantaneous daily and annual scales during the observation period from late august 2017 to the end of october 2019 there were 725 days of observations including 696 intact days without any missing observations the average instantaneous et was approximately 0 02 mm 10 min and half of the values varied between 0 005 and 0 025 mm 10 min fig 2a at the daily scale the mean maximum and minimum et values were 1 36 5 04 and 0 003 mm d respectively fig 2b the mean annual et was approximately 410 mm y fig 2c temporal variations are also shown in fig 3 the intraday change pattern of the et br values was characterized as sinusoidal with a maximal value occurring at noon fig 3a daily et values generally followed a sinusoidal variation during a given year the change trend was similar to those of rn ta and ea fig 4 specifically et increased gradually from the beginning of the year peaked during summer and then decreased with the grape harvest and ultimately approached to zero at the end of winter fig 3b 3 2 et measurements et sr from the surface renewal method during the two growing seasons from 2018 to 2019 the sr observation covered 247 days in which there were 213 intact days without any missing observations the et values from the sr method at the instantaneous and daily scales were 0 03 mm 10 min fig 5 a and 2 17 mm d on average respectively fig 5b the mean seasonal et was approximately 270 mm y fig 5c the intraday change pattern of the et sr values was similar to that of et br but with a larger amplitude fig 6 a due mainly to equipment maintenance there were gaps in et sr estimates making the sinusoidal variation less obvious nonetheless an increasing trend of et occurred at the beginning of the growing season whereas a decreasing trend was exhibited at the end of the growing season fig 6b 3 3 comparison between the et br and et sr measurements to perform a meaningful comparison a pair of 15 549 synchronous et br and et sr measurements on 213 intact days were adopted as shown in fig 7 et sr values were generally greater than those of et br at the instantaneous scale the mean et br value was 0 027 mm 10 min with a standard deviation sd of 0 026 mm 10 min whereas it was 0 031 0 030 mm 10 min for et sr measurements fig 7a an analysis of variance anova statistical test revealed significant differences p 0 01 between the instantaneous et br and et sr measurements which led to differences in daily ets accumulated from instantaneous values specifically the average mean daily et br value was 1 94 1 06 mm d with minimum and maximum values of 0 27 and 5 04 mm d respectively for et sr measurements the mean minimum and maximum daily values were 2 24 1 19 0 26 and 6 14 mm d respectively fig 7b when these daily et values accumulated to the seasonal scale difference margin values of 43 and 25 mm were observed for 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 7c the et measurements are similar to values reported by other studies e g trambouse et al 1998 and yunusa et al 2004 especially close to the values for the same grape species obtained by kang s group in an adjacent region li et al 2008 reported that the daily average et derived from the breb was 2 12 mm d for the experimental vineyard from later april to early october in 2006 whereas it was 2 38 mm d derived from a combination of sap flow and microlysimetry for the same periods in 2009 zhang et al 2011 and varied from 2 09 to 2 21 mm d in 2012 2015 as observed by the ec system zhao et al 2018 when the daily et br and et sr values were paired and plotted in a scatter plot a large number of the paired et measurements were distributed along the 1 1 line with a few et sr values higher than those of et br fig 8 the regression line between et br and et sr was close to the 1 1 line r2 0 83 with a slope of 1 03 and an intercept of 0 25 the mae mape and rmse statistics were 0 41 mm d 22 22 and 0 57 mm d respectively these results indicated that although differences were exhibited between the et br and et sr measurements the two groups of measured daily et values were highly correlated and the mean values were similar 4 discussion 4 1 performance of the sr method the et br and et sr measurements correlated well as mentioned in section 3 3 indicating that the sr method was comparable to the breb method to further understand the performance of the sr method the data in fig 8 were classified into three groups representing different weather conditions by judging sunshine hours h specifically it was classified as overcast when h 0 with or without precipitation whereas it was a sunny day when h 10 and the remaining days were cloudy fig 7 and table 3 show that the two measurements become more correlated as h decreases on overcast days et sr was closet to et br and the paired data were distributed closely along the 1 1 line with r2 mape and rmse values of 0 90 13 5 and 0 12 mm d respectively on cloudy days r2 decreased to 0 80 but mape and rmse increased with values of 20 5 and 0 43 mm d respectively on sunny days although et sr still agreed well with et br r2 was 0 70 and the errors became much greater as mape increased to 24 4 and rmse reached 0 79 mm d the results suggest that the sr and breb methods perform differently under varied sunlight conditions the process of the intraday flux estimates may reveal the reason on a given sunny day the sensible heat flux estimated by the sr method h sr was generally smaller than those obtained from the breb method h br fig 9 the relatively small sensible heat flux would lead to a high value of latent heat flux due to energy balance in addition there were fewer sharp fluctuations in h sr than in h br because the former was obtained from high frequency temperature and independent of net radiation rn fig 9c but the latter was calculated using rn directly fig 9d therefore h br fluctuated sharply as rn changed especially when the radiometer was occasionally shaded by clouds on overcast days although h br still fluctuated sharply the difference between h br and h sr was small resulting in a marginal difference between le br and le sr or et br and et sr fig 10 from this point of view the sr method is likely more robust in et measurement than the breb method especially on sunny days a future step would be to thoroughly test the sr method under varied sunlight conditions in combination with ec observations from various sites 4 2 calibration coefficient α and uncertainty when applying the sr method when applying the sr method a semiempirical calibration coefficient α is often used to estimate sensible heat flux eq 6 the α coefficient is determined by linear regression of hsr against sensible heat flux observed using an independent method ho i paw u et al 1995 hu et al 2018 such as the ec method or the breb method in the form of ho i hsr α 1 the uncalibrated sensible heat flux hsr estimated with α 1 was used in this study to assess sr method performance when no independent observation was available to perform a calibration the results in section 3 3 indicate that et sr values estimated by rearranging the energy balance equation using uncalibrated hsr agree well with et estimated with the breb method r2 0 83 and mape 22 several studies have reported α values for grapevines during the growing season in the range of 0 8 to 1 5 spano et al 2000 shapland et al 2012c poblete echeverría et al 2014 although variables related to canopy structure sensor placement and frequency response and data processing choices may impact α depending on canopy structure and temperature sensor height above the canopy top a value of 1 is likely suitable for accurately estimating et for grapevines with sparse canopies at heights of approximately 1 5 2 0 m as indicated by spano et al 2000 and this study suggesting that the sr method requires no calibration and is easy for practical applications moreover snyder et al 2008 suggested that the α value could be determined with acceptable accuracy by trial and error if the other independent observation was unavailable nonetheless the effects of α values on et sr are further analyzed by changing the α value from 0 8 to 1 5 with a 0 1 increment unsurprisingly the instantaneous sensible heat flux h values increase linearly as α increase fig 11 a because of the linear relationship shown in eq 6 as such the increasing h would lead to a decrease in et estimated by inversing the energy balance equation eq 10 therefore daily et values exhibit a declining trend as α increases from 0 8 to 1 5 with average values of 2 51 2 38 2 24 2 12 2 02 1 92 1 82 and 1 74 mm d fig 11b however the maximum difference is 0 50 mm between the uncalibrated and calibrated mean daily et values i e between et sr α 1 and et sr α 1 5 fig 12 further indicates that if et br is chosen as the criterion et sr estimated using α between 0 8 and 1 5 correlated well with et br with a minimum r2 of 0 73 and a maximum mape of 31 the best et sr is estimated using an α of 1 2 in terms of mae 0 38 mm d rmse 0 52 mm d and mape 19 64 followed by et sr α 1 3 mae 0 39 mm d rmse 0 51 mm d and mape 20 01 and et sr α 1 1 mae 0 39 mm d rmse 0 51 mm d and mape 20 03 in fact these three groups of et sr values show nonsignificant differences and the uncalibrated et sr α 1 is nearly comparable to these three groups of et sr with mae rmse and mape values of 0 43 mm d 0 51 mm d and 22 22 respectively notably r2 between et br and et sr decreased as α increased changing from 0 85 α 0 8 to 0 73 α 1 5 fig 12 these results indicate that although α between 1 1 and 1 3 could obtain less biased et sr measurements with r2 and mape values of approximately 0 8 and 20 the uncalibrated et sr is likely accurate for application with r2 and mape values of 0 83 and 22 respectively 4 3 abnormal β value and uncertainty in the breb method there are different abnormal β rejection ranges to solve the singularity point when β approaches 1 such as β 0 75 ortega farias et al 1996 and 1 3 β 0 7 unland et al 1996 ma et al 2015 which may have a significant effect on et estimates comunian et al 2018 maruyama et al 2019 in the following section four abnormal β rejection criteria including eq 11 0 3 0 333 and 1 5 to 0 667 with a narrowing trend table 4 were selected to discuss the impact on et br et brs0 et brs1 et brs2 and et brs3 respectively the results in fig 13 show that daily ets accumulated from instantaneous ets on the basis of different abnormal β value rejection criteria exhibit certain differences et brs0 is significantly different from et sr measurements as shown in section 3 3 et brs1 and et sr measurements exhibited significant differences anova p 0 01 n 213 anova still revealed a significant difference between the et brs2 and et sr measurements although the significance level changed to 0 05 the et brs3 and et sr measurements were not significantly different the results indicate that the wider the abnormal β value rejection range is the more invalid et values will be replaced with interpolation and a more significant difference exists between the et br and et sr measurements in addition the smaller the β value is the more robust the breb method according to eq 4 from this point of view the abnormal β value rejection criterion proposed by perez et al 1999 is more rigorous than that proposed by maruyama et al 2019 because there are fewer normal β values in the range of 1 to 1 fig 14 similarly because 61 of normal β values calculated using h sr and le sr distribute at 1 to 1 whereas it is a maximum of 43 for the breb method under varied abnormal β rejection criteria the performance of the sr method is more robust than that of the breb method 5 conclusions this study investigated the performance of the sr method over sparse grapevine canopies in an arid region an experiment was designed to achieve the objective by installing the sr and br systems in the same location that shares the same available energy at an arid vineyard daily et values measured by the sr method et sr agree well with et br measured by the breb method with r2 mae rmse and mape values of 0 83 0 41 mm d 0 57 mm d and 22 22 respectively even if the semiempirical coefficient α in the sr method is uncalibrated in addition et br measurements are significantly affected by abnormal β value rejection criteria although et sr measurements were affected by the α values the et sr values measured with uncalibrated α 1 and calibrated α 0 8 1 5 methods showed nonsignificant differences it is concluded that the sr method is likely more robust than the breb method and is easy economic and accurate for practical application credit authorship

2878,accurate evapotranspiration et measurements are fundamental for improving the understanding of water energy related processes and for validating model simulations however et is inherently difficult to measure unambiguously the surface renewal sr method which describes the turbulence exchange process from a new perspective has been successfully applied within affordable costs from crops to tall forest canopies however the sr method with its significant practical potential remains uncommon in measuring et likely because a semiempirical calibration coefficient α is needed therefore this study evaluates the performance of the sr method without any calibration and compares et measurements between the sr and bowen ratio br methods to test which method is more robust the results from a two year experiment at an arid vineyard show the following factors 1 daily et estimates by the sr method et sr without calibration α 1 agree well with those from the br method et br with determination coefficient r2 mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percent error mape values of 0 83 0 41 mm d 0 57 mm d and 22 22 respectively 2 compared to et br et sr values calibrated using a α of 1 2 et sr α 1 2 contained the least error in terms of mae 0 38 mm d and mape 19 64 followed by et sr α 1 3 and et sr α 1 1 without a significant difference 3 et br measurements were affected by abnormal br value rejection criteria with wider rejection ranges associated with more significant differences between the et br and et sr measurements and 4 61 of br values calculated from the sr based fluxes were distributed in the range of 1 1 whereas a maximum of 43 were in the same range based on br measurements under various abnormal br rejection criteria for the studied grapevine canopies the uncalibrated sr method is more robust than the br method and it is easy economic and accurate for practical application keywords evapotranspiration surface renewal method bowen ratio energy balance method vineyard data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a water phase change process from liquid or ice to gas including transpiration from vegetation and evaporation from water surfaces soil etc at a global scale multiyear et equals precipitation with a value of approximately 500 103 km y of which terrestrial et is approximately 70 103 km y and accounts for 60 of land precipitation oki kanae 2006 trenberth et al 2007 and the ratio can be greater than 90 in arid regions shen chen 2010 moreover et consumes approximately half of the incoming net radiation absorbed by the land surface trenberth et al 2009 therefore as a crucial flux linking the hydrological cycle and energy processes accurate observation of et is important for understanding the water energy nexus and land atmosphere feedbacks as well as for managing irrigation and water resources wang dickinson 2012 fisher et al 2017 blatchford et al 2019 however et is inherently difficult to measure unambiguously sivapalan 2003 because the et process is affected and controlled by environmental biophysical combined factors tan et al 2019 liu et al 2022 nonetheless in situ et can be measured indirectly based on theories of mass balance e g lysimeter or boundary layer meteorology e g the eddy covariance ec technique and the bowen ratio energy balance breb method which has been reviewed previously such as verstraeten et al 2008 allen et al 2011 wang dickinson 2012 and liu et al 2022 although the ec technique has been widely adopted for measuring et in various ecosystems over the global fluxnet baldocchi 2008 2014 the ec method encounters a commonly reported problem energy balance enclosure mauder et al 2020 ukkola et al 2022 moreover ec systems and lysimeters are costly and require professional maintenance and they are usually used in scientific research despite requiring less maintenance and costing approximately 15 of the cost of the ec system the breb method requires a homogeneous land surface without advection and encounters singularity estimates when the bowen ratio approaches 1 perez et al 1999 maruyama et al 2019 hicks et al 2020 limiting its application because accurate et observation is fundamental for improving water energy related learning observation methods with affordable cost should be developed to benefit farmers and early researchers lack funding the surface renewal sr method is an alternative to measure et because temperature sensors are mainly required and they are much easier to operate and more affordable compared to other methods such as the breb sr theory is based on the concept that gas and liquid molecules are transported by turbulent eddies it was first proposed by higbie 1935 and applied in chemistry in the 1990 s paw u et al 1992 1995 introduced and revised the sr method to measure sensible heat flux h over land surfaces by assuming that an air parcel would be replaced by a new parcel in the turbulence exchange process and heat would be added throughout the parcel height thus scalar exchange between surfaces and the atmosphere could be traced via high frequency temperatures paw u et al 1995 thereafter the sr method was promoted to practical applications in estimating latent heat flux and et via energy balance residual approaches snyder et al 1996 2008 hu et al 2018 the sr method is first used to calculate h using either of the following approaches 1 one scale ramp based classical structure function analysis paw u et al 1995 snyder et al 1996 2 two scale ramp based structure function analysis shapland et al 2012a shapland et al 2012b and 3 monin obukhov similarity theory most analysis castellvi 2004 the difference between the first and the second sr method is that an independent method such as ec or breb is required to determine a semiempirical calibration coefficient in the former paw u et al 1995 whereas the latter only requires high frequency temperature observations without any calibration shapland et al 2012a the most based third method requires additional measurements to estimate h such as wind speed which also complicates the application castellví 2018 the sr method with varied approaches for solving h has been tested and successfully applied in measuring et mainly to support crop irrigation such as snyder et al 2008 shapland et al 2012c moratiel and martínez cob 2013 suvočarev et al 2014 and pozníková et al 2018 the method is applicable not only for various crops from cotton rice and wheat to wine grape and orange orchard but also for tall forest canopies in both stable and unstable conditions with accuracy comparable to the ec method e g spano et al 2000 shapland et al 2012c suvočarev et al 2014 mekhmandarov et al 2015 savage 2017 and summarized in paw u et al 2005 and hu et al 2018 nonetheless the sr method has been mainly applied in california usa italy spain chile and israel considering that the sr method has high accuracy and significant potential in daily et measurement but remains uncommon in application the objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the sr method in addition the sr theory is different from those applied in the ec and br methods which may benefit et studies from a new perspective the ultimate goals are to identify the effects of coefficient calibration and uncalibration on et measurements in the sr method and to determine which measurement is better and more robust in terms of quality sr or br 2 description of field experiment and et measurements 2 1 experimental site and field observations the experiment was conducted at a vineyard 106 1 44 66 e 38 14 17 54 n altitude 1143 m near yinchuang city ningxia hui autonomous region northwest china fig 1 it is a continental temperate climate with a mean annual air temperature precipitation and pan evaporation of 9 c 200 mm and 1250 mm respectively in the study region grapevine is normally planted in late april and the sprouting flowering and fruit set fruit inflation maturity and defoliation stages of grapevines are late april to 20 may 21 may to early july early july to early august middle august to end of august and early september to early october respectively vines in the vineyard vitis vinifera l cv moldova were 7 years old and had row and vine spacings of 3 5 m and 0 5 m respectively the soil had a sandy loam texture with light gray calcium a mean bulk density of 1 5 g cm3 and a field capacity of approximately 13 in the 0 80 cm layer the grapevines with an average height of approximately 1 5 m at their mature stage were arranged on a vertical plane by iron wires at three levels with heights of approximately 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m respectively supported by a 2 m high single trellis system oriented northwest to southeast fig 1b irrigation consisted of an initial flood irrigation at the start of the season followed by periodic drip irrigation approximately every 20 days until maturity a br system was installed in the middle of the vineyard to measure meteorological data in august 2017 the system included a net radiometer nr lite kipp zonen netherlands at a height of 2 m approximately 0 5 m above the canopy temperature and humidity sensors hmp155a vaisala finland at heights of 2 and 2 5 m respectively and two soil heat flux plates hfp01 hukseflux netherlands at depths of 8 cm underground fig 1 and table 1 the system was powered by solar panels sensors were sampled every 5 s and 10 min statistics were recorded automatically by a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc usa these measurements were used to estimate et using the br method see section 2 2 for details from late june 2018 through late october 2019 two thermocouples fw3 campbell scientific inc usa were deployed at a height of approximately 2 25 m thermocouple temperatures were recorded at high frequency 10 hz and were used to estimate sensible heat flux with the sr method see section 2 3 for details then et was estimated by the energy balance residual 2 2 bowen ratio energy balance method the breb method is a typical technique for indirectly measuring et based on the simplified surface energy balance equation in the breb the bowen ratio β is used to divide the available energy between the latent heat le and sensible heat h fluxes β can be estimated using the measured meteorological data with vertical gradients eq 1 1 β h le γ δ t δ e where γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 δt is the air temperature ta difference c between the two measured heights and δe is the difference in actual water vapor pressure kpa γ can be calculated using atmospheric press p in kpa or elevation above sea level h in m eq 2 whereas the actual water vapor pressure can be calculated using relative humidity rh and the saturation vapor pressure estimated from air temperature ta eq 3 according to fao paper 56 allen et al 1998 2 γ 0 665

heat flux w m 2 respectively and l is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 which is set to a constant of 2 49 106 the sensible heat flux h is determined by eq 5 as follows 5 h br β r n g 1 β in this study rn g and δt were obtained directly from the flux tower observations 2 3 surface renewal method the sr method is based on the concept of air parcels periodically coming in contact with a surface exchanging mass or energy with the surface and then being replaced paw u et al 1995 this concept results in ramp like structures in high frequency temperature measurements which can be used to estimate the surface air exchange because the temperature change rate with time of air parcels is directly related to sensible heat flux the average heating of the air parcel and the number of times the air parcel is renewed over a sampling period are used to estimate the sensible heat flux for that period eq 6 paw u et al 1995 6 h sr α z ρ c p a τ where α is the calibration coefficient z is the temperature measurement height m ρ is the air density g m 3 c p is the specific heat of air at constant pressure j g 1 k 1 a is the average ramp amplitude k and τ the ramp period s is the mean air parcel renewal time over the sampling period in this study a was estimated by solving for the real roots of the following cubic equation eq 7 van atta 1977 containing the 2nd 3rd and 5th order structure functions as described in shapland et al 2012c and pozníková et al 2018 7 a 3 10 s 2 r s 5 r s 3 r a 10 s 3 r 0 where sn r is the n th order structure function n 2 3 5 and can be obtained from the high frequency air temperature observation 8 s n r 1 m j i 1 j m t i t i j n where ti and ti j are high frequency temperature measurements from the thermocouple between two sequential time lags m is the number of temperature points in the 10 min interval measured at a sample frequency f of 10 hz in this study and r the ratio of the sample lag interval j to f is the structure function time lag and is set as 0 5 s in this study thereafter τ can be determined by eq 9 9 τ r a 3 s 3 r the calibration coefficient α was set to 1 for initial computations but was varied over a range of 0 8 to 1 5 in a subsequent sensitivity analysis see section 4 2 for details then et at a 10 min scale was determined as a residual of the surface energy balance equation 10 e t sr r n g h sr l 2 4 data processing and statistical assessment for the breb method daytime 7 00 19 00 gmt 8 10 min average et values et 10min were calculated from 10 min observations according to equations in section 2 2 ten minute periods with negative et values or with β falling outside the range specified in eq 11 perez et al 1999 were considered abnormal and were removed from the data set the removed data were replaced by interpolated values using the linear interpolation method next daily et values were accumulated using the et 10min measurements during 7 00 19 00 gmt 8 the quality of each daily et value was assessed according to the proportion of valid data during the day and was classified into five categories table 2 analog to the nash sutcliffe coefficient nash sutcliffe 1970 monthly seasonal and annual et values were accumulated from these daily et values 11 1 ε β 1 ε where ε is the error interval and it is defined as 0 019 δe for the sr method instantaneous h values were first estimated by the high frequency temperature based on eq 6 and instantaneous et values by eq 10 considering the purpose of comparing et values between the breb and sr methods the negative instantaneous daytime et values from the sr method were also classified invalid and deleted thereafter invalid et values were obtained from linear interpolation and daily ets were summarized from the instantaneous ets with the same process as mentioned in the breb calculation finally intact daytime datasets i e each 10 min data point without any missing observations were used for comparison the mean absolute error mae mean absolute percent error mape root mean square error rmse and determine coefficient r2 were used for further analysis 3 results 3 1 et measurements et br from the breb fig 2 shows the statistics of et values from the breb method at the 10 min period hereinafter instantaneous daily and annual scales during the observation period from late august 2017 to the end of october 2019 there were 725 days of observations including 696 intact days without any missing observations the average instantaneous et was approximately 0 02 mm 10 min and half of the values varied between 0 005 and 0 025 mm 10 min fig 2a at the daily scale the mean maximum and minimum et values were 1 36 5 04 and 0 003 mm d respectively fig 2b the mean annual et was approximately 410 mm y fig 2c temporal variations are also shown in fig 3 the intraday change pattern of the et br values was characterized as sinusoidal with a maximal value occurring at noon fig 3a daily et values generally followed a sinusoidal variation during a given year the change trend was similar to those of rn ta and ea fig 4 specifically et increased gradually from the beginning of the year peaked during summer and then decreased with the grape harvest and ultimately approached to zero at the end of winter fig 3b 3 2 et measurements et sr from the surface renewal method during the two growing seasons from 2018 to 2019 the sr observation covered 247 days in which there were 213 intact days without any missing observations the et values from the sr method at the instantaneous and daily scales were 0 03 mm 10 min fig 5 a and 2 17 mm d on average respectively fig 5b the mean seasonal et was approximately 270 mm y fig 5c the intraday change pattern of the et sr values was similar to that of et br but with a larger amplitude fig 6 a due mainly to equipment maintenance there were gaps in et sr estimates making the sinusoidal variation less obvious nonetheless an increasing trend of et occurred at the beginning of the growing season whereas a decreasing trend was exhibited at the end of the growing season fig 6b 3 3 comparison between the et br and et sr measurements to perform a meaningful comparison a pair of 15 549 synchronous et br and et sr measurements on 213 intact days were adopted as shown in fig 7 et sr values were generally greater than those of et br at the instantaneous scale the mean et br value was 0 027 mm 10 min with a standard deviation sd of 0 026 mm 10 min whereas it was 0 031 0 030 mm 10 min for et sr measurements fig 7a an analysis of variance anova statistical test revealed significant differences p 0 01 between the instantaneous et br and et sr measurements which led to differences in daily ets accumulated from instantaneous values specifically the average mean daily et br value was 1 94 1 06 mm d with minimum and maximum values of 0 27 and 5 04 mm d respectively for et sr measurements the mean minimum and maximum daily values were 2 24 1 19 0 26 and 6 14 mm d respectively fig 7b when these daily et values accumulated to the seasonal scale difference margin values of 43 and 25 mm were observed for 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 7c the et measurements are similar to values reported by other studies e g trambouse et al 1998 and yunusa et al 2004 especially close to the values for the same grape species obtained by kang s group in an adjacent region li et al 2008 reported that the daily average et derived from the breb was 2 12 mm d for the experimental vineyard from later april to early october in 2006 whereas it was 2 38 mm d derived from a combination of sap flow and microlysimetry for the same periods in 2009 zhang et al 2011 and varied from 2 09 to 2 21 mm d in 2012 2015 as observed by the ec system zhao et al 2018 when the daily et br and et sr values were paired and plotted in a scatter plot a large number of the paired et measurements were distributed along the 1 1 line with a few et sr values higher than those of et br fig 8 the regression line between et br and et sr was close to the 1 1 line r2 0 83 with a slope of 1 03 and an intercept of 0 25 the mae mape and rmse statistics were 0 41 mm d 22 22 and 0 57 mm d respectively these results indicated that although differences were exhibited between the et br and et sr measurements the two groups of measured daily et values were highly correlated and the mean values were similar 4 discussion 4 1 performance of the sr method the et br and et sr measurements correlated well as mentioned in section 3 3 indicating that the sr method was comparable to the breb method to further understand the performance of the sr method the data in fig 8 were classified into three groups representing different weather conditions by judging sunshine hours h specifically it was classified as overcast when h 0 with or without precipitation whereas it was a sunny day when h 10 and the remaining days were cloudy fig 7 and table 3 show that the two measurements become more correlated as h decreases on overcast days et sr was closet to et br and the paired data were distributed closely along the 1 1 line with r2 mape and rmse values of 0 90 13 5 and 0 12 mm d respectively on cloudy days r2 decreased to 0 80 but mape and rmse increased with values of 20 5 and 0 43 mm d respectively on sunny days although et sr still agreed well with et br r2 was 0 70 and the errors became much greater as mape increased to 24 4 and rmse reached 0 79 mm d the results suggest that the sr and breb methods perform differently under varied sunlight conditions the process of the intraday flux estimates may reveal the reason on a given sunny day the sensible heat flux estimated by the sr method h sr was generally smaller than those obtained from the breb method h br fig 9 the relatively small sensible heat flux would lead to a high value of latent heat flux due to energy balance in addition there were fewer sharp fluctuations in h sr than in h br because the former was obtained from high frequency temperature and independent of net radiation rn fig 9c but the latter was calculated using rn directly fig 9d therefore h br fluctuated sharply as rn changed especially when the radiometer was occasionally shaded by clouds on overcast days although h br still fluctuated sharply the difference between h br and h sr was small resulting in a marginal difference between le br and le sr or et br and et sr fig 10 from this point of view the sr method is likely more robust in et measurement than the breb method especially on sunny days a future step would be to thoroughly test the sr method under varied sunlight conditions in combination with ec observations from various sites 4 2 calibration coefficient α and uncertainty when applying the sr method when applying the sr method a semiempirical calibration coefficient α is often used to estimate sensible heat flux eq 6 the α coefficient is determined by linear regression of hsr against sensible heat flux observed using an independent method ho i paw u et al 1995 hu et al 2018 such as the ec method or the breb method in the form of ho i hsr α 1 the uncalibrated sensible heat flux hsr estimated with α 1 was used in this study to assess sr method performance when no independent observation was available to perform a calibration the results in section 3 3 indicate that et sr values estimated by rearranging the energy balance equation using uncalibrated hsr agree well with et estimated with the breb method r2 0 83 and mape 22 several studies have reported α values for grapevines during the growing season in the range of 0 8 to 1 5 spano et al 2000 shapland et al 2012c poblete echeverría et al 2014 although variables related to canopy structure sensor placement and frequency response and data processing choices may impact α depending on canopy structure and temperature sensor height above the canopy top a value of 1 is likely suitable for accurately estimating et for grapevines with sparse canopies at heights of approximately 1 5 2 0 m as indicated by spano et al 2000 and this study suggesting that the sr method requires no calibration and is easy for practical applications moreover snyder et al 2008 suggested that the α value could be determined with acceptable accuracy by trial and error if the other independent observation was unavailable nonetheless the effects of α values on et sr are further analyzed by changing the α value from 0 8 to 1 5 with a 0 1 increment unsurprisingly the instantaneous sensible heat flux h values increase linearly as α increase fig 11 a because of the linear relationship shown in eq 6 as such the increasing h would lead to a decrease in et estimated by inversing the energy balance equation eq 10 therefore daily et values exhibit a declining trend as α increases from 0 8 to 1 5 with average values of 2 51 2 38 2 24 2 12 2 02 1 92 1 82 and 1 74 mm d fig 11b however the maximum difference is 0 50 mm between the uncalibrated and calibrated mean daily et values i e between et sr α 1 and et sr α 1 5 fig 12 further indicates that if et br is chosen as the criterion et sr estimated using α between 0 8 and 1 5 correlated well with et br with a minimum r2 of 0 73 and a maximum mape of 31 the best et sr is estimated using an α of 1 2 in terms of mae 0 38 mm d rmse 0 52 mm d and mape 19 64 followed by et sr α 1 3 mae 0 39 mm d rmse 0 51 mm d and mape 20 01 and et sr α 1 1 mae 0 39 mm d rmse 0 51 mm d and mape 20 03 in fact these three groups of et sr values show nonsignificant differences and the uncalibrated et sr α 1 is nearly comparable to these three groups of et sr with mae rmse and mape values of 0 43 mm d 0 51 mm d and 22 22 respectively notably r2 between et br and et sr decreased as α increased changing from 0 85 α 0 8 to 0 73 α 1 5 fig 12 these results indicate that although α between 1 1 and 1 3 could obtain less biased et sr measurements with r2 and mape values of approximately 0 8 and 20 the uncalibrated et sr is likely accurate for application with r2 and mape values of 0 83 and 22 respectively 4 3 abnormal β value and uncertainty in the breb method there are different abnormal β rejection ranges to solve the singularity point when β approaches 1 such as β 0 75 ortega farias et al 1996 and 1 3 β 0 7 unland et al 1996 ma et al 2015 which may have a significant effect on et estimates comunian et al 2018 maruyama et al 2019 in the following section four abnormal β rejection criteria including eq 11 0 3 0 333 and 1 5 to 0 667 with a narrowing trend table 4 were selected to discuss the impact on et br et brs0 et brs1 et brs2 and et brs3 respectively the results in fig 13 show that daily ets accumulated from instantaneous ets on the basis of different abnormal β value rejection criteria exhibit certain differences et brs0 is significantly different from et sr measurements as shown in section 3 3 et brs1 and et sr measurements exhibited significant differences anova p 0 01 n 213 anova still revealed a significant difference between the et brs2 and et sr measurements although the significance level changed to 0 05 the et brs3 and et sr measurements were not significantly different the results indicate that the wider the abnormal β value rejection range is the more invalid et values will be replaced with interpolation and a more significant difference exists between the et br and et sr measurements in addition the smaller the β value is the more robust the breb method according to eq 4 from this point of view the abnormal β value rejection criterion proposed by perez et al 1999 is more rigorous than that proposed by maruyama et al 2019 because there are fewer normal β values in the range of 1 to 1 fig 14 similarly because 61 of normal β values calculated using h sr and le sr distribute at 1 to 1 whereas it is a maximum of 43 for the breb method under varied abnormal β rejection criteria the performance of the sr method is more robust than that of the breb method 5 conclusions this study investigated the performance of the sr method over sparse grapevine canopies in an arid region an experiment was designed to achieve the objective by installing the sr and br systems in the same location that shares the same available energy at an arid vineyard daily et values measured by the sr method et sr agree well with et br measured by the breb method with r2 mae rmse and mape values of 0 83 0 41 mm d 0 57 mm d and 22 22 respectively even if the semiempirical coefficient α in the sr method is uncalibrated in addition et br measurements are significantly affected by abnormal β value rejection criteria although et sr measurements were affected by the α values the et sr values measured with uncalibrated α 1 and calibrated α 0 8 1 5 methods showed nonsignificant differences it is concluded that the sr method is likely more robust than the breb method and is easy economic and accurate for practical application credit authorship

2879,assessing the natural or man made alterations in the hydrological characteristics of watershed systems is a prerequisite to develop watershed management restoration and conservation strategies and plans the range of variability approach rva based on a suite of indicators of hydrologic alteration iha is most widely used to assess hydrologic alterations however the traditional rva and its revised versions and alternatives all suffer from major challenges such as binning the data and using only the target range to compare the probability distributions of the hydrologic variables in the pre and post impact periods through applying simplified statistical analyses this paper proposes the density difference approach dda and the weighted rva to overcome these challenges despite the previous approaches which divide the time series of the continuous variables into discrete groups dda uses the continuous probability density function pdf estimated by the gaussian kernel density estimation kde technique it considers the magnitude frequency and order position of all individual data in the alteration analysis furthermore to account for the variations in the values and frequencies of the variables beyond the target range which is neglected in the traditional rva the weighted rva approach has been proposed these suggested approaches along the other widely used alteration assessment approaches have been applied to quantify the hydrologic alteration in the gharnaveh watershed in the northeast of iran using 50 years of daily discharge data recorded at the tamar hydrometry station at the outlet of the watershed the performance of the alteration analysis approaches was further evaluated using the randomly generated time series with the arbitrary changes in the probability distribution parameters the results indicate a significant difference in the alteration values and ranks calculated by different alteration analysis approaches compared to the traditional rva the weighted rva resulted in higher alteration degrees for most of the iha indicators dda outperformed the other alteration analysis approaches for both the observed and randomly generated data it better accounted for the alteration in the key characteristics of the probability distribution including the location dispersion and skewness parameters of the randomly generated data series we recommend dda as an appropriate hydrologic alteration assessment approach that assists water resource managers and decision makers through accounting for multi dimensional attributes of hydrologic alterations keywords hydrologic alteration indicators range of variability density plot alteration assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a quantitative and reasonable assessment ofthe hydrologicalteration of watersheds plays a crucial role in the development of the socio economic plans environment protection and rehabilitation programs and water resources management projects maingi marsh 2002 herawati et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 global climate change and human interventions across the watershed systems are the main deriving forces leading to the hydrologic alterations arnell gosling 2013 rosenberg et al 2000 wang et al 2010 alteration of the hydrologic regime in a watershed system results in various consequences in their ecological environmental and socioeconomic functions and services arthington et al 2006 bunn arthington 2002 pal 2016 poff zimmerman 2010 sakaris 2013 the hydrologic regime of a river comprises five key characteristics including magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change zeiringer et al 2018 which are impacted by modification of natural hydrologic processes through human activities caruso 2013 sharma et al 2020 sun et al 2017 therefore understanding and quantifying the likely impacts of human intervention across the watershed systems on these characteristics constitutes a principal component of the hydrologic alterations analyses considering the increased and widespread attention the analysis of hydrologic regime alteration has recently gained the development of appropriate tools and methods is of vital importance the hydrologic regime analysis is usually based on two steps of developing indicators and conducting an assessment liu et al 2018 literature review indicates that more than 200 hydrologic indicators have been developed during previous studies gao et al 2009 karimian et al 2018 yang et al 2012 of which the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha developed by the nature conservancy tnc in the usa richter et al 1996 is the most widely used index system xue et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 which represents most of the important facets of the flow regime principato and viggiani 2012 regarding the assessment methodologies over 200 unique environmental flow assessment methodologies have been introduced in the literature peres cancelliere 2016 tharme 2003 some of the most recently used assessment methods for hydrologic regime alteration include the range of variability approach richter et al 1996 the dundee hydrologic regime alteration method dhram black et al 2005 histogram matching approach hma shiau wu 2008 histogram comparison approach hca huang et al 2017 entropy theory and ahp approach kim singh 2014 li et al 2015 and morphological alteration of iha indicators approach maa zheng et al 2021 the rva approach despite its widespread application is subject to potential limitations huang et al 2017 shiau wu 2008 it merely considers changes in the indicators values within the target range i e between the 25th and 75th percentiles for the natural or pre impact period and ignores the alteration in the frequencies of hydrologic indicators for beyond the target range shiau wu 2008 this will lead to loss of important information particularly for the iha indicators with skewed probability distributions principato and viggiani 2012 furthermore the rva method may yield non intuitive results for indicators with a large frequency for a particular value or when the denominator of the expression expected frequency used for quantifying the hydrologic alteration is equal to 0 tnc 2009 also it only considers the difference in frequency of the pre impact and post impact hydrologic indicator values within the target range and ignores alteration related to the order of hydrologic representative years hry i e wet average and dry years that is an important holistic feature of the flow regime yin et al 2015 several improvements to the traditional rva and the development of alternative approaches have been introduced in the literature to overcome these limitations yin et al 2015 developed a metric for assessing the alteration of the hry order based on the euclidean distance and then combined this metric with rva to address the potential underestimation of the degree of alteration made by the traditional rva shiau and wu 2008 proposed the application of the hma to address the limitations of the rva approach the hma approach assesses hydrologic regime alteration by using the degree of histogram dissimilarity as a metric which is based on the quadratic form distance between the frequency vectors of the pre impact and post impact histograms weighted by a specific similarity matrix huang et al 2017 lin et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 although a histogram may contain all of the statistical information of an indicator including information about wet average or dry years it still suffers from some limitations that have been discussed in detail in huang et al 2017 to eliminate the limitations of the hma approach huang et al 2017 proposed the hca approach which is also based on the histogram analysis by comparing the pre impact and post impact frequency histograms of an indicator it first calculates the degree of similarity between pre impact and post impact frequency histograms and then deduces the degree of alteration huang et al 2019 yuqin et al 2019 integrated hry and hca to eliminate the potential underestimation of the degree of alteration computed by hca which may occur due to ignoring hydrologic representative years to overcome the limitation of ignoring the morphological characteristic of the time series by the traditional rva zheng et al 2021 developed a method to obtain the morphological alteration of the iha indicators by considering the ordering relationships and magnitude differences of all the elements of hydrologic time series they quantified the morphological alteration of the iha indicators by comparing the hasse matrices of pre and post impact time series and integrated the morphological alteration with frequency alteration obtained by the traditional rva as can be noticed all the above mentioned assessment methods developed and applied in recent years have used the bin counting histogram method to estimate and compare the probability density function pdf of continuous hydrologic variables during the pre and post impact periods although bin counting is a more common and computationally quick method of pdf estimation it suffers from major drawbacks such as subjectivity in the choice of the number or width of bins and replacing data from their individual location to bins data binning which causes the probability histogram shape to become discontinuous and flat in each bin węglarczyk 2018 to address the major shortcomings of the previous hydrological alteration assessment approaches this study proposes two innovative approaches namely weighted range of variability approach weighted rva and density difference approach dda the weighted rva has been proposed to overcome the main drawback of the traditional rva by accounting for alterations beyond the target range that may contain important information although the latest version of the rva tnc 2009 evaluates alteration values for three categories of low medium and high range of rva none of the previous studies reported how to aggregate these three values into a single alteration index for each indicator to calculate the overall degree of the hydrologic alteration we introduce a method to aggregate these three values in the weighted rva approach dda has been proposed to overcome the major drawbacks caused by bin counting histogram that has been used in most of the previous alteration assessment approaches the concept advantages and disadvantages and the calculation procedure of the proposed approaches are explained in the materials and methods section we demonstrate the results of applying these approaches to assess hydrologic alterations in the gharnaveh watershed in northeast of iran where a range of human interventions has changed hydrological processes across the watershed we will also compare the results of the proposed approaches with those of the traditional rva and some introduced methods in the recent thread of developing hydrological alteration analysis approaches including hma hca and maa 2 materials and methods 2 1 iha indicators the iha software program has been developed by the nature conservancy tnc as a tool for calculating the characteristics of natural and altered hydrologic regimes tnc 2009 it summarizes long periods of daily hydrologic data into a much more manageable series of ecologically relevant hydrologic indicators more details about this software program are given in its user s manual tnc 2009 in this study it has been applied to extract the time series of 33 hydrologic indicators in five groups table 1 from 50 years daily discharge data recorded at the tamar hydrometry station as can be noticed from table 1 the iha software covers an extensive and meaningfull range of hydrologic parameters usefull for the hydrological change analysis these parameters account for changes in all key features of a hydrologic regime including magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of chang due to the non normality of the given daily discharge data the non parametric statistics have been selected to calculate the iha indicators 2 2 range of variability approach rva in the rva analysis the range of natural variability of 33 iha indicators during the pre impact period is set as the flow management and restoration targets the rva target range for each indicator is defined as percentile levels for non parametric analysis or a multiple of the indicator s standard deviations for parametric analysis for the pre impact period richter et al 1996 the degree to which the rva target range is not attained during the impact period is considered as an indicator of hydrologic alteration the degree of change or alteration of a given hydrologic indicator di is defined as follows richter et al 1998 peres cancelliere 2016 shiau wu 2006 xue et al 2017 1 d m n o m n e n e m 1 2 33 where dm is the degree of hydrological alteration of the mth indicator no m is the number of years in which the observed value of the iha indicator fell within the target range i e between the 25th and 75th percentiles for the natural or pre impact period and ne is the number of years for which the value of the indicator is expected to fall within the target range based on the frequency of occurrence in the pre impact period it is worth to note that the rva target range can be adopted as any selected percentile levels or as a simple multiple of the parameter s standard deviation for the pre impact period for instance zheng et al 2020 adopted 33rd and 67th percentiles and wang et al 2016 used 16th and 84th percentiles the interquartile range 25th and 75th percentiles however is the most frequently used boundary values for the rva target range richter et al 1998 shiau and wu 2008 ge et al 2018 du et el 2020 in this study ne is assumed equal to 50 of the post impact number of years du et al 2020 the overall degree of the hydrologic alteration is calculated as an average of alteration degree for all indicators as follows singh jain 2021 2 d o r v a m 1 n d m n where do rva is the overall degree of alteration of the flow regime and n is the number of hydrologic indicators the higher the value of do rva the greater the degree of alteration the eq 1 only considers the changes in the frequency of the intermediate values for an iha indictor and neglects the changes in the frequencies of its low and high values this leads to an information loss about the alteration that may occur in the tail values of the probability distribution of an iha indicator principato and viggiani 2012 for example when half of data values for an iha indicator during the post impact period fall in the range of the middle category target range regardless of the frequencies of data values in the low and high categories the traditional rva approach considers no alteration for that indicator however due to alteration in the probability distribution of that iha indicator during the post impact period the frequencies of the data values in the low and high categories may largely deviate from their expected frequency of 25 2 3 weighted range of variability approach weighted rva despite that the latest versions of the iha software program tnc 2009 calculates the rva for three categories of low middle and high values in most of the previous studies lin et al 2016 shi et al 2019 singh jain 2021 the rva for the middle category has been considered as a basis to calculate the degree of alteration in other words the middle category of the iha values has been used as the target range i e between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the pre impact data set in fact the alteration beyond the target range either below the lower bound of the target range or above the upper bound of the target range is neglected shiau wu 2008 while for many hydrological parameters particularly parameters with the skewed distribution the alteration in their low or high values is important principato and viggiani 2012 as mentioned in the introduction section the latest version of the iha software calculates alteration in three categories for each of the 33 iha indicators however there is no reported solution in the literature about how to aggregate them into a single value to indicate the overall degree of alteration to overcome this problem the weighted rva has been proposed in this study to this end we used eq 1 for each category of rva separately and the weighted mean of the alteration for these categories has been calculated as the degree of alteration since the frequency of values in the rva categories i e 0 25 0 5 and 0 25 for the low middle and high rva categories respectively are different the weight for each category has been assigned equal to its frequency however depending on the importance of low middle and high values of the iha indicators in a hydrologic analysis different weights can be assigned to each category provided that their sum is equal to one depending on the distribution of post impact data in three categories the absolute value of alteration degree calculated by the weighted rva might exceed the upper limit of 1 adopted by other approaches therefore to make the result of the weighted rav approach consistent with the other approaches the calculated alteration degree for an iha indicator should be standardized to the range of 0 1 by dividing to the maximum possible value of its alteration degree based on the assigned weights for three categories of rva the maximum possible value of the alteration degree for an iha indicator can be calculated using the following equation 3 maxa w h w l 2 w h 2 w l w m where wl wm and wh indicate weights assigned to the low middle and high categories of rva the main advantages of the weighted rva are inclusion of changes in all categories of rva and preference of the users through assigning weights to each rva category in aggregating them into a single alteration degree however it still suffers from some challenges of the traditional rva such as intuitive selection of the comparative interval target range and the division by zero or a small value due to no or low frequency of the hydrologic variable within the target range of the pre impact period 2 4 histogram matching approach hma shiau and wu 2008 presented a histogram matching approach hma for assessment of the flow regime alteration the central idea behind the hma is that two data sets of an indicator would be similar if their frequency histograms resemble each other the hma uses the degree of histogram dissimilarity as a metric for impact assessment which is based on the quadratic form distance between the frequency vectors of the pre and post impact histograms weighted by a specified similarity matrix the calculation procedure is as follows the number of bins has been calculated by following equation in this study freedman and diaconis 1981 4 nb m r m n m 1 3 2 r mq where nbm is the number of histogram classes rm is the data range which is the difference between the largest and smallest data values nm is the total number of data for mth indicator and rmq is the inter quartile range of the first and third quartiles a quadratic form distance niblack et a 1993 has been employed to measure the dissimilarity between two histograms of pre and post impact periods 5 d q h k h k t a h k where h h1 h2 hnb t and k k1 k2 knb t are the frequency vectors of the pre impact histogram h and the post impact histogram k respectively and h k is the distance vector a aij where aij is the similarity between classes i and j for a linear similarity function the similarity between classes i and j is calculated by following expression shiau and wu 2008 6 a ij 1 d ij d max in which dij vi vj is ground distance between classes i and j where vi and vj are mean values of classes i and j dmax max dij v1 vnb the degree of histogram dissimilarity for the mth hydrologic indicator is determined as follows shiau and wu 2008 7 d hma m d q m 4 2 nb m 1 the overall degree of the hydrologic alteration is calculated as follows shiau and wu 2008 8 d o h m a m 1 n d hma m 2 n where do hma is the overall degree of alteration of the flow regime and n is the number of hydrologic indicators the higher the value of do hma the greater the degree of alteration more detailed information about hma is available in shiau and wu 2008 the major drawbacks of hma are binning the data węglarczyk 2018 and using the quadratic form distance metric proposed by niblack et al 1993 the problems caused by data binning will be discussed in the results and discussion section the quadratic form distance metric proposed by niblack et al 1993 underestimates distances because it tends to accentuate the similarity of probability distributions without a pronounce mode rubner et al 1998 principato and viggiani 2012 2 5 histogram comparison approach hca huang et al 2017 got inspiration from rva and hma to propose the hca approach to quantify the hydrologic alteration of the iha indicators hca considers both class by class correspondence and cross class information the calculation procedure is as follows the number of classes for the histogram is determined in the same way as the hma method using eq 4 the similarity degree sm is defined as follows huang et al 2017 9 s m s m cc s m ci 10 s m cc i 1 nb m m i n h i m k i m 11 s m ci i 1 nb m m i n h w i m k w j m 1 i j nb m where hm h1 m h2 m hnbm m and km k1 m k2 m knbm m are the frequency vectors of histograms hm and km i and j are the original serial numbers of the histogram classes from left to right w is the serial number ordered from largest to smallest according to the frequency vectors in cases where the frequency vectors are the same w is ordered from left to right according to the histogram class s m cc calculates the similarity by comparing the frequency vectors of the same histogram class and reflects the class by class correspondence and s m ci calculates the similarity by comparing the frequency vectors of the same serial number and reflects the cross class information both s m cc and s m ci range between 0 and 1 making sm range between 0 and 1 the degree of alteration for the mth hydrologic indicator is calculated by eq 12 huang et al 2017 12 d hca m 1 s m the overall degree of the hydrologic alteration is calculated as follows huang et al 2017 13 d o h c a m 1 n d hca m 2 n where do hca is the overall degree of alteration of the flow regime and n is the number of hydrologic indicators the higher the value of do hca the greater the degree of alteration more detailed information about hca has been given in huang et al 2017 the major drawback of hca is binning the data that is further discussed in the results and discussion section 2 6 morphological alteration approach maa according to lacasa et al 2015 the ordering position and magnitude of each element in a time series should be considered to uniquely characterize it and its fluctuations lacasa et al 2015 based on this point and to include the morphological alteration of the time series into alteration analysis zheng et al 2021 developed an approach that can consider the ordering relationships and magnitude differences of all the elements the calculation procedure is as follows the magnitude difference of the iha indicators is calculated the same as the traditional rva using eq 1 the hasse matrix h of a sequence of an iha indicator is defined by comparing every two elements of a time series as follows zheng et al 2021 14 h ij 1 i f q i k q j k k 1 2 m i j 1 2 n 1 i f q i k q j k k 1 2 m i j 1 2 n 0 o t h e r w i s e where qi k and qj k are the ith and jth element of the indicators time series for the kth variable e g for a selected iha indicator qi 1 and qi 2 means the ordering variable and magnitude variable for the ith year an iha time series is divided into three ranges by the rva boundaries 25th and 75th percentile of the pre impact period values below the lower boundary are defined as low values within the rva boundaries as middle values and high values above the higher boundary the elements in a time series falling into the low middle and high value ranges are converted to 1 2 and 3 respectively the ordering variable is derived from the time index of the time series 1 for the first year and n for the last year of the time series the magnitude variable is represented by hii pi pmax where pi is the ith converted iha value and pmax is the maximum of all converted ihas which substitutes the diagonal elements of the hasse matrix given a n n pre impact matrix hpre and post impact n n matrix hpost the hasse distance of the two matrices dh pre post is defined by following equations zheng et al 2021 15 d h p r e p o s t 1 w d o p r e p o s t w d d p r e p o s t 16 d d p r e p o s t i 1 n h ii pre h ii post n 17 d o p r e p o s t i 1 n 1 j i 1 n h ij pre h ij post n n 1 2 where dd is the distance due to the diagonal elements of the two matrices while do is the distance due to the off diagonal elements the summations of diagonal elements and off diagonal elements cannot be greater than n and n n 1 2 respectively the resulting dd and do fall into the range from 0 to 1 w has a range of 0 1 and is a weighting parameter determined by the importance of ordering relationships and magnitude differences therefore the range of the hasse distance varies between 0 and 1 a decrease in the hasse distance implies a higher similarity between the two time series in case the length of pre impact n1 and post impact n2 time series are different the associated hasse matrices are denoted as h1 and h2 the hasse distance between h1 and h2 can be calculated by comparing n1 n2 1 times the overlapping part of these two matrices moving the smaller matrix diagonally from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the bigger one the smallest distance among the n1 n2 1 distances is the hasse distance between h1 and h2 in this way the most similar part between pre impact and post impact datasets can be found the overall alteration of mth iha dmo is a combination of the frequency alteration dm and the morphological alteration dhm zheng et al 2021 18 d mo 1 1 d m 1 d hm the overall degree of the hydrologic alteration is calculated as follows zheng et al 2021 19 d o m a a 1 n i 1 n d mo where do maa is the overall degree of alteration of the flow regime and n is the number of hydrologic indicators the higher the value of do maa the greater the degree of alteration more detailed information about maa can be found in zheng et al 2021 the major drawback of maa is a simple aggregation of the frequency alteration and morphological alteration which results in an overestimation of the alteration degree 2 7 density difference approach dda out of all probability distribution functions the probability density function pdf best shows how the whole probability mass is distributed over the values of a random variable węglarczyk 2018 the pdf estimation methods are either parametric or nonparametric the parametric methods assume a parametric model for the underlying pdf of the data they are only suitable when the data are known to follow a presumed distribution however when the underlying distribution is unknown they are inadequate or inappropriate on the other hand the nonparametric methods impose fewer assumptions on the shape of the underlying distribution the kernel density estimation kde was developed more than a half century ago by rosenblatt 1956 and parzen 1962 to derive a smooth empirical pdf based on individual locations of all sample data parzen 1962 rosenblatt 1956 it has gained wide explosion of interest during last decades in many fields of study sheather 2004 we used kde to prepare and compare the density plots of the iha indicators during pre and post impact periods as an index of hydrologic alteration the calculation procedure is as follows the a kernel density estimator with kernel function k for an iha indicator is defined sheather 2004 20 f x 1 n h i 1 n k x x i h where xi is the sample values n is the total number of iha data h is the tunable smoothing parameter window width or bandwidth which governs the amount of smoothing applied to the sample k is the selected kernel density function that is required to satisfy sheather 2004 21 k x d x 1 there are many types of kernel functions of which the most widely used is the gaussian density with infinite support sheather 2004 gong et al 2014 the efficiency of the estimated kernel density depends upon two factors 1 an appropriate choice of the kernel bandwidth and 2 selection of the kernel function latif mustafa 2020 we used the gaussian density function and the silverman s bandwidth in this study silverman 1986 proposes the following equation to estimate the smoothing factor or bandwidth 22 h 0 9 m i n σ iqr 1 34 n 1 5 where σ is the standard deviation of the iha indicator data iqr is the interquartile range of the iha indicator data n is the total number of the iha indicator data this equation is widely used in practice and referred to as the silverman s bandwidth or silverman s rule of thumb sheather 2004 difference in density functions of the pre impact and post impact time series for each iha indicator is calculated with the total variation distance which is well known in probability theory schmid schmidt 2006 and is the most classical concept of distance between probability measures cai lim 2022 23 d d 1 2 f x p r e f x p o s t d x the concept of the above equation is in line with the concept of the mean integrated squared error which is a widely used choice of overall measure of the discrepancy between two probability distributions sheather 2004 since the area under the density plots is equal to one in case of zero overlaps between two density plots the difference between them will be equal to two therefore in the above equation the difference in the densities of the pre and post impact time series has been divided by two to limit the degree of alteration values into the range of 0 to 1 it should be noted that the range of values in two time series is usually different therefore to numerically subtract the probability density functions of two time series their pdfs should be calculated within their unified range from minimum to maximum of two series the overall degree of the hydrologic alteration is calculated as follows huang et al 2017 24 d o d d a m 1 n d d 2 n where do dda is the overall degree of alteration of the flow regime and n is the number of hydrologic indicators the higher the value of do dda the greater the degree of alteration the main advantage of dda includes accounting for the changes in magnitude frequency and order position of all individual data along a time series in the alteration analysis through using and comparing kde the subjective selection of the bandwidth parameter is considered as a major disadvantage of dda the advantages and disadvantages of kde application in real life examples have been thoroughly demonstrated by węglarczyk 2018 2 8 study area the gharnaveh watershed is one of the major subwatersheds of the gorganrud river basin in the golestan province in the northeast of iran it has a total catchment area of 78 500 ha and lies between 37 32 1 n to 37 47 8 n and 55 32 e to 56 1 7 e with an elevation range of 155 to 1420 m a s l the long term mean annual precipitation is 527 mm mostly occurring during november may the topographic edaphic and vegetative conditions of the watershed accompanied by intensive human interferences give rise to a high potential for floods and soil erosion the fertile and fragile deep loess soils on undulating hills and extensive dry farming are dominant characteristics of the watershed following the implementation of national socio economic development plans during the past decades extensive land use change from natural forests and rangelands to croplands has occurred in the country with no exemption of the study area this condition has resulted in an increase in the frequency and magnitudes of floods during 1980 2005 in the study area the deadliest and most devastating floods in the study area occurred in 2001 2002 and 2005 ardalan et al 2009 therefore several small scale earth filled and rock filled concrete dams were implemented across upstream tributaries as watershed management projects the earlier land use changes and later watershed management practices as well as climate change seems to have caused hydrologic regime alteration in the study area therefore this study has aimed to quantify these alterations to shed light on the impacts of anthropogenic interventions on the hydrologic regime of the gharnaveh watershed as a representative of many watersheds across the region with similar challenges mentioned above to achieve this aim daily discharge data recorded in 50 years 1969 2018 at the tamar hydrometry station located near the outlet of the watershed were obtained from the regional water company of the golestan province the construction of earth filled and rock filled concrete dams has been chosen as flood mitigation and gully control strategies and practices by the local authorities responsible for watershed management after the occurrence of large floods in 2002 and 2005 therefore the periods before and after 2005 were marked as the pre and post impact periods respectively the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha software program tnc 2009 was applied to produce the iha indicators time series and rva analysis furthermore the weighted rva hma hca maa and dda alteration analysis approaches were applied to quantify hydrologic regime alteration in the gharnaveh watershed and their results were compared 3 results and discussion the preliminary results of the iha software program indicate that a significant hydrologic regime change has occurred after the implementation of watershed management interventions in response to the devastating flood occurrences in 2001 2002 and 2005 these watershed management practices mainly as earth fill and rock fill cemented dams have been implemented to control or mitigate floods and gully erosion as the major natural hazards in the study area although these practices seem to be successful in mitigating the floods they have been resulted in a significant decrease in the water yield of the gharnaveh watershed fig 2 which comprises the central part of the contributing drainage area to the bostan dam s reservoir fig 1 indeed these hydrologic changes are accompanied by alteration in various ecohydrologically essential indicators the application of the iha software has facilitated summarizing the long term recorded daily discharge data of the tamar hydrometry station into times series of ecologically relevant hydrologic indicators that have been used to assess the hydrologic alteration with different alteration assessment approaches 3 1 analysis of hydrologic alteration using rva and weighted rva the hydrologic alteration for each iha indicator has been calculated at three categories of low middle and high values using the traditional rva and weighted rva fig 3 and table 2 the boundary of these three categories for each iha indicator has been defined based on the target range of the indicator i e the interquartile range iqr of the indicator s data during the pre impact period richter et al 1998 shiau and wu 2008 ge et al 2018 the values within the target range are considered as middle rva category the values below and above the target range are classified as low rva and high rva categories respectively for all the indicators of the groups one and two of iha indicators table 2 which characterize the magnitude of hydrologic changes the frequency of low values has been increased particularly for the minimum flow indicators and monthly flows in the spring and summer seasons which consists of the dry period of the year on the other hand the frequency of their high and middle values has decreased although not as intense as low values the most significant alteration occurred for 1 and 3 day minimum flows and the number of zero flow days the number of zero flow days shows a very large increase for the high rva category among the months the most significant alteration is seen for august the minimum alteration has occurred for the low pulse duration and the occurrence dates of the minimum and maximum daily flows the frequency of large daily shifts from low flows to high flows rise rate has decreased while the frequency of large shifts from high flow to low flows fall rate has increased magnitudes of alteration for the maximum flow indicators are less pronounced than the minimum flow indicators as can be noticed from table 3 for most of the iha indicators particularly for the extreme low flow indicators 1 to 30 day minimum flow indicators baseflow and monthly flows of the driest months of the year july and august the degree of alteration yielded by the weighted rva is higher than the traditional rva approach this is mainly because for the majority of the iha indicators the degree of alteration for the low and high rva categories is greater than the middle rva category which is considered as the target range for the hydrologic alteration calculation in the traditional rva method see table 2 in fact the lower or upper tail values of the iha indicators distribution experience more alteration due to the human interventions and climatic perturbations therefore it can be concluded that the inclusion of all categories of rva in the calculation of hydrologic alteration degree provides more reliable results however the weighted rva is also subjected to the inherent drawback of the rva method which yields non intuitive results for indicators that have a large number of annual statistics equal to a particular value or are divided by a small frequency number a fractional number less than one for instance the 1 and 3 day minimum flow indicators may have many zero values during the post impact period particularly in arid and semi arid environments or the number of zero flow days may be zero or very small for the pre impact period particularly in temperate and humid areas in the case of the former situation the calculated value of the rva will be very large for the low category of rva see for instance in fig 3 the low rva of the 1 and 3 day minimum flows for the latter case either the division by zero occurs which is undefined or the division by a small frequency value which usually results in a very large rva value for the high rva category see for instance in fig 3 the high rva of the zero flow days therefore we excluded the zero flow days indicator from further analysis furthermore the iha indicators were ranked according to their alteration in a descending order table 3 we used the average method for ranking according to this method the average of the ranks for tied values are assigned to all the tied values 3 2 analysis of hydrologic alteration using hma hca and maa in this study the hma hca and maa alteration analysis approaches have been applied to the study area too their results have been included in table 3 as is evident there is a considerable variation in the alteration value range and rank of the iha indicators obtained by different alteration analysis approaches which will be discussed later in this text the hma and hca approaches are based on comparing the frequency histograms of the iha indicators in pre and post impact periods the frequency histograms of the iha indicators for the study area in the pre and post impact periods have been shown in fig 4 this figure clearly demonstrates that for the iha indicators with high alteration degree the dissimilarity of the pre and post impact histograms is very significant as seen there is a great dissimilarity between the pre and post impact histograms for the august monthly discharge 1 3 and 7 day minimum discharges and baseflow indicators regarding the results of the maa approach the alteration values and ranks of the iha indicators are strongly dependent on the given values of the weighting parameter w which determines the importance of morphologic and frequency alterations this finding has been demonstrated in fig 5 as can be noticed changing the value of w in its defined range 0 1 has a less pronounced effect on the variation of the iha indicators with high alteration values and low alteration ranks in this study the importance of the morphologic and frequency alterations has been considered equal w 0 5 the maa approach uses the hasse distance between two hasse matrices of the pre and post impact time series to depict their morphological difference zheng et al 2021 as a sample the hasse matrices for monthly discharges of august and may respectively with high and low alteration values have been presented in appendix a 3 3 analysis of hydrologic alteration using dda the frequency densities of the 32 iha indicators in the pre and post impact periods have been displayed in fig 6 as seen the density plots of the pre and post impact periods for the august monthly flow 1 3 7 and 30 day minimum flows and base flow indicators show the highest dissimilarity these are the iha indicators with the highest alteration values according to all the applied alteration analysis approaches on the other hand the density plots of the pre and post impact periods for the march monthly flow high pulse counts dates of minimum and maximum flows and low pulse length present the highest similarity since the area under the probability density plots is equal to one subtraction of two density functions for the pre and post impact time series of an iha indicator provides a sound method to quantify the difference between them as an alteration degree the results of the application of this procedure for 32 iha indicators at the tamar hydrometry station have been presented in fig 7 this figure clearly shows that for which value of an indicator along the x axis how much and in which direction negative or positive the alteration has occurred as shown in fig 7a for all months of the year the frequency of low discharges has increased during the post impact period on the contrary the frequency of high discharges for the majority of months except for the winter season has decreased considering the extreme flows the frequency of very low values for the minimum flow indicators has extremely increased during the post impact period fig 7b for the maximum flow indicators although the frequency of their low values has slightly increased the frequency of their very high values except for 30 and 90 day maximum flows has also negligibly increased fig 7b on the other hand the frequency of their moderate values has slightly decreased during the post impact period the dates of minimum and maximum flows showed the least alteration fig 7b the results of the dda approach for the hydrological fluctuation indicators frequency duration and rate of changes indicate that the high pulse duration rise rate and fall rate indicators have undergone the largest alteration respectively fig 7c the frequency of the high number of low and high pulses has slightly increased and vice versa the frequency of high absolute rate of changes has increased for both the rise and fall rates and vice versa this indicates that the hydrologic response of the study area has tended towards a flashier condition in the post impact period this can also be deduced from the alteration pattern of reversals whereas the frequency of a high number of reversals has increased during the post impact period 3 4 comparing the results of alteration approaches to compare the conformity of different alteration analysis approaches the pearson s correlation analysis has been carried out among the alteration values obtained by applying different alteration analysis approaches the correlation results have been presented in fig 8 moreover we calculated the correlation of the results of the applied alteration approaches with the changes in the median values of the iha indicators during pre and post impact periods the highest pairwise correlations have been revealed between the traditional rva and maa and between hma and hca these results are not so unexpected given that the maa approach integrates the morphologic alteration to the frequency alteration calculated with the traditional rva and the similarity of the hma and hca approaches in using the frequency histograms to calculate the alteration degree both of the proposed approaches in this research i e the weighted rva and dda exhibit the most conformity with other approaches although the correlation values between the weighted rva and other approaches are slightly higher than the correlation values between the dda and other approaches the weighted rva suffers from the limitations attributed to the traditional rva approach huang et al 2017 shiau wu 2008 zheng et al 2021 therefore it can be concluded that the dda approach outperforms other approaches the hma and hca approaches show a very high correlation with each other however they particularly hca show the least conformity with other approaches also there is the highest correlation between the iha indicators median change and alteration values calculated by weighted rva approach followed by dda rva and maa approaches the least correlation exists between the iha indicators median change and alteration values calculated by the hca and hma approaches hma and hca are subject to the main disadvantage of the histogram known as the bin edge problem wand and jones 1994 which might result in the distribution shape skewness reversal due to changes in bin locations weber 2008 another disadvantage of the histogram estimators is that they display bumps in frequencies that may have been observed only due to noise zambom and dias 2013 in histogram based approaches even when two time series show equal frequency for all bins we cannot say they are similar because the degree of their dispersion inside bins may be different kim 2009 despite being rooted in the histogram methodology the bin edge problem is not shared by the kernel density estimation zambom and dias 2013 furthermore the kernel density estimator shows several advantages over commonly used histograms węglarczyk 2018 it better exhibits the details of the pdf such as multimodality which might occur for pdf of some data sets it uses all sample points locations which helps to better reveal the information contained in the sample the bias of the kernel estimator is of one order better than that of a histogram estimator sheather 2004 however it exhibits an undesirable case when the variable under study is nonnegative and a part of its data lies near zero when this condition happens the probability leakage below zero may occur particularly if a higher value for the band width is assigned węglarczyk 2018 two possible remedies to this drawback are to logarithmize the data or to use an assymetric kernel węglarczyk 2018 however for the densities comparison objective this drawback can be disregarded as has been presented in table 3 the variation among the alteration values obtained for 32 iha indicators using the hma and hca approaches is less pronounced compared to the other approaches the highest standard deviation of alteration values for 32 iha indicators has been observed for the weighted and traditional rva approaches respectively a significant portion of the very high value of the standard deviation in the case of the weighted rva approach can be attributed to the 1 and 3 day minimum flow indicators that attained very high values of alteration degree for the low rva category see table 2 this has been stated as a drawback of the rva approach when encountering a large number of annual statistics equal to a particular value such as zero tnc 2009 in case of the gharnaveh watershed due to the implementation of many earth filled dams across the upper tributaries the frequency of low flows and no flow days has markedly increased in the recent years because the watershed s surface runoff is retained in the reservoirs of the constructed dams on the other hand the watershed is dominantly covered by deep loess deposits and there exists no actual aquifer to be recharged most of the ponded water in the reservoirs evaporated back into the air resulting in increase in the frequency of low flows and zero flow days in downstreams the abovementioned drawback is aggravated when the number of data in the post impact period is considerably less than in the pre impact period when this happens the expected frequency for the rva categories particularly for the low or high categories may become an absolute fractional number less than one resulting in absolute alteration values larger than 3 which is logically unacceptable for instance as can be noticed from table 2 and fig 3 for 1 and 3 day minimum flow in the low rva category and number of zero flow days in the high rva category the alteration values are unacceptably large therefore care should be taken to this limitation when using the weighted rva method as seen in table 3 exclusion of 1 and 3 day minimum flow indicators from the alteration analysis using the weighted rva will decrease the mean and standard deviation of the alteration values to 0 47 and 0 23 which bring them into the range of the results of other alteration analysis approaches inclusion of the low and high rva categories changes in the weighted rva approach despite logical from a theoretical point of view might practically limit its application to those iha indicators which suffer from the abovementioned conditions the range and standard deviation of the iha indicators alteration values for maa and dda are close to each other but the mean value of the alterations is higher for the maa approach this can mainly be attributed to integrating the morphologic alteration to the frequency alteration in the maa approach followed by dda the alteration degrees from the maa approach shows the most conformity with the alteration degrees from other approaches however there is no straightforward guide on how to assign the value of the weighting parameter w that has significant effects on the calculation of the alteration value particularly for the iha indicators with moderate alteration comparing the alteration values of the iha indicators groups in the gharnaveh watershed shows that the most alteration has occurred for the group two magnitude and duration of annual extreme water conditions and five rate and frequency of water condition changes the least alteration has been observed for group three timing of annual extreme water conditions and four frequency and duration of high and low pulses within group two the low extreme indicators have experienced the most alteration while the high extreme indicators have shown less alteration also within group one magnitude of monthly water conditions the dry months july and august exhibit high alteration values these results indicate that although the implementation of the earth filled and rock fill cemented dams has mitigated the magnitude of floods it has resulted in a significant alteration in the hydrologic regime worsening the ecohydrological condition of the watershed this conclusion can be supported by the large values of the alteration degree attained by the low extreme flow indicators particularly the baseflow indicator which is a very important indicator from an ecohydrological point of view the length of the data used for the pre and post impact periods were 37 and 13 years respectively although according to silvermam 1986 the number of data points required to get a reliable density estimate grows exponentially with dimensionality this is not a concern for the dda approach that uses univariate one dimensional timeseries silverman 1986 suggested that four points is enough for accurate kde for one dimensional data botta dukat and lukacs 2021 indicated that at least 10 20 individuals should be measured to fit a kde to a single trait however like with other statistical analysis methods the larger the sample size the closer the fit of kde to the actual distribution and the more robust the result of the dda approach will be 3 5 evaluating the performance of alteration approaches in detecting alteration in key parameters of the probability distribution alteration in a hydrologic time series may occur as changes in different parameters of the probability distribution location dispersion and asymmetry are the most important parameters in probability theory and statistics to assess the ability of the studied alteration analysis approaches in quantifying the changes in the probability distribution parameters a normally distributed example series of 1000 records using the mean and standard deviation values of the october discharge data µ 0 8 and sd 0 3 m3 sec of the tamar hydrometry station has been randomly generated as the base series then its location mean and dispersion standard deviation parameters were changed as much as 50 percent to generated the s1 to s4 example series furthermore a right skewed s5 series and a left skewed s6 series normally distributed series were generated with the same standard deviation values as the base series but with location values of 0 4 and 1 2 and shape alpha parameters of 10 and 10 respectively fig 9 shows the probability densities of these randomly generated example series and table 4 summarizes their descriptive statistics since the number of records 1000 was limited the mean and standard deviations of the randomly generated example series are slightly different from their expected values the alteration degrees due to changes in the mean standard deviation and skewness of the base series have been calculated with the studied alteration analysis approaches and summarized in table 5 and presented in fig 10 the results of the alteration analysis approaches are different for the example series for the changes in the first moment mean base s3 and base s4 although still remarkable the variation in the alteration degree calculated with different approaches is less pronounced compared to the changes in the second standard deviation base s1 and base s2 and third skewness base s5 and base s6 moments the variance among the results of different approaches is more pronounced for the changes in the standard deviation particularly when its value is reduced generally speaking the maa approach overestimates the alteration degree this is mainly because it adds the morphological alteration to the frequency alteration calculated by the traditional rva approach another noticeable result is that the direction of change increase or decrease in the first and third moments rarely affects the alteration value calculated with the hma hca and dda approach while for the second moment and other approaches the direction of change markedly affects the alteration degree the intersection overlapping area between two probability density functions is widely used as the similarity index and thus the non overlapping area can be used as the distance dissimilarity index cha 2007 pastore and calcagni 2019 cai and lim 2022 therefore the overlap index ovl between the s1 to s6 series and the base series has been computed with the baysetestr package makowski et al 2019 and subtracted from 1 to obtain the non overlap value novl as the index of dissimilarity the overlapping and nonoverlapping indices for the paired densities of the s1 to s6 series with the base series have been included in table 5 as seen the nonoverlap index resulting from the baysetestr is almost the same as the dda approach s result accordingly it can be concluded that the dda approach outperforms regardless the type of the changes occurred in the distribution properties the subjective estimation of the bandwidth parameter in the dda approach using the silverman s rule of thumb may undemine the performance of it therefore to evaluate the effect of the bandwidth parameter on the dda results a sensitivity analysis has been carried out the results indicated that the alteration degree calculated by dda is not very sensitive to the bandwidth parameter fig 11 4 conclusions the combined application of the rva alteration analysis approach and the iha indicators is the usual routine to assess hydrological alterations however the traditional rva suffers from some limitations therefore several adjustments and alternatives viz hma hca and maa have been proposed in the literature in this study we proposed two alternative alteration analysis approaches including the weighted rva and dda and applied them for the time series of iha indicators at the tamar hydrometry station near the outlet of the gharnaveh watershed in northeast of iran their results were compared with the results of the traditional rva hma hca and maa approaches the main conclusions of this study are summarized as follows a high level of hydrologic alteration has occurred following the implementation of flood control structural measures in the gharnaveh watershed it should be noted that the calculated alteration values are the combined effects of anthropogenic interventions and climate change further research is required to separate these effects the weighted rva approach proposed in this study resulted in higher alteration values compared to the traditional rva as it accounts for alteration in all rva categories the dda approach proposed in this study compares the continuous pdf of two time series to reveal their difference comparing the continuous pdfs ensures that changes in magnitude frequency and order position of all individual data are considered in alteration analysis this is a very distinct advantage of dda compared to the other used approaches although the empirical selection of the smoothing factor or bandwidth is considered as an important downside of kde the final result of the dda approach is not so sensitive to the bandwidth changes we suggest dda as a superior hydrologic alteration analysis approach this has been supported by a theoretical analysis on example random data sets demonstrating excellent performance of dda in terms of accurately detecting and calculating the alteration in important parameters of the probability distribution functions including location dispersion and skewness in many watersheds particularly in developing and non developed regions there is not enough data to adequately perform the assessment of hydrological alterations in these cases mixed use of the hydrologic simulation and water resources optimization and allocation models can generate appropriate data sets to analyze the hydrological alterations caused by different management alternatives intended by the water resources decision makers and managers pardo loaiza et al 2021 in this context soft computing techniques such as evolutionary algorithms ehteram et al 2018 artificial neural networks taormina et al 2015 machine learning fotovatikhah et al 2018 shamshirband et al 2020 and deep learning fu et al 2020 have been demonstrated to be promising techniques particularly suited for prediction and optimization of future hydrologic conditions due to human interventions furthermore a subjective component pertinent to all alteration analysis approaches which still not explicitly addressed in the literature is the equal weights assigned to all iha indicators to calculate the overall hydrologic alteration degree there is no robust rationale to assign equal weights to the iha indicators future research could for instance investigate how to assign a weight for each iha indicator based on its importance and to assess hydrologic alterations in watersheds with scarce or no recorded discharge data such research could contribute to assisting water resource managers and decision makers design watershed management restoration and

2879,assessing the natural or man made alterations in the hydrological characteristics of watershed systems is a prerequisite to develop watershed management restoration and conservation strategies and plans the range of variability approach rva based on a suite of indicators of hydrologic alteration iha is most widely used to assess hydrologic alterations however the traditional rva and its revised versions and alternatives all suffer from major challenges such as binning the data and using only the target range to compare the probability distributions of the hydrologic variables in the pre and post impact periods through applying simplified statistical analyses this paper proposes the density difference approach dda and the weighted rva to overcome these challenges despite the previous approaches which divide the time series of the continuous variables into discrete groups dda uses the continuous probability density function pdf estimated by the gaussian kernel density estimation kde technique it considers the magnitude frequency and order position of all individual data in the alteration analysis furthermore to account for the variations in the values and frequencies of the variables beyond the target range which is neglected in the traditional rva the weighted rva approach has been proposed these suggested approaches along the other widely used alteration assessment approaches have been applied to quantify the hydrologic alteration in the gharnaveh watershed in the northeast of iran using 50 years of daily discharge data recorded at the tamar hydrometry station at the outlet of the watershed the performance of the alteration analysis approaches was further evaluated using the randomly generated time series with the arbitrary changes in the probability distribution parameters the results indicate a significant difference in the alteration values and ranks calculated by different alteration analysis approaches compared to the traditional rva the weighted rva resulted in higher alteration degrees for most of the iha indicators dda outperformed the other alteration analysis approaches for both the observed and randomly generated data it better accounted for the alteration in the key characteristics of the probability distribution including the location dispersion and skewness parameters of the randomly generated data series we recommend dda as an appropriate hydrologic alteration assessment approach that assists water resource managers and decision makers through accounting for multi dimensional attributes of hydrologic alterations keywords hydrologic alteration indicators range of variability density plot alteration assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a quantitative and reasonable assessment ofthe hydrologicalteration of watersheds plays a crucial role in the development of the socio economic plans environment protection and rehabilitation programs and water resources management projects maingi marsh 2002 herawati et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 global climate change and human interventions across the watershed systems are the main deriving forces leading to the hydrologic alterations arnell gosling 2013 rosenberg et al 2000 wang et al 2010 alteration of the hydrologic regime in a watershed system results in various consequences in their ecological environmental and socioeconomic functions and services arthington et al 2006 bunn arthington 2002 pal 2016 poff zimmerman 2010 sakaris 2013 the hydrologic regime of a river comprises five key characteristics including magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change zeiringer et al 2018 which are impacted by modification of natural hydrologic processes through human activities caruso 2013 sharma et al 2020 sun et al 2017 therefore understanding and quantifying the likely impacts of human intervention across the watershed systems on these characteristics constitutes a principal component of the hydrologic alterations analyses considering the increased and widespread attention the analysis of hydrologic regime alteration has recently gained the development of appropriate tools and methods is of vital importance the hydrologic regime analysis is usually based on two steps of developing indicators and conducting an assessment liu et al 2018 literature review indicates that more than 200 hydrologic indicators have been developed during previous studies gao et al 2009 karimian et al 2018 yang et al 2012 of which the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha developed by the nature conservancy tnc in the usa richter et al 1996 is the most widely used index system xue et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 which represents most of the important facets of the flow regime principato and viggiani 2012 regarding the assessment methodologies over 200 unique environmental flow assessment methodologies have been introduced in the literature peres cancelliere 2016 tharme 2003 some of the most recently used assessment methods for hydrologic regime alteration include the range of variability approach richter et al 1996 the dundee hydrologic regime alteration method dhram black et al 2005 histogram matching approach hma shiau wu 2008 histogram comparison approach hca huang et al 2017 entropy theory and ahp approach kim singh 2014 li et al 2015 and morphological alteration of iha indicators approach maa zheng et al 2021 the rva approach despite its widespread application is subject to potential limitations huang et al 2017 shiau wu 2008 it merely considers changes in the indicators values within the target range i e between the 25th and 75th percentiles for the natural or pre impact period and ignores the alteration in the frequencies of hydrologic indicators for beyond the target range shiau wu 2008 this will lead to loss of important information particularly for the iha indicators with skewed probability distributions principato and viggiani 2012 furthermore the rva method may yield non intuitive results for indicators with a large frequency for a particular value or when the denominator of the expression expected frequency used for quantifying the hydrologic alteration is equal to 0 tnc 2009 also it only considers the difference in frequency of the pre impact and post impact hydrologic indicator values within the target range and ignores alteration related to the order of hydrologic representative years hry i e wet average and dry years that is an important holistic feature of the flow regime yin et al 2015 several improvements to the traditional rva and the development of alternative approaches have been introduced in the literature to overcome these limitations yin et al 2015 developed a metric for assessing the alteration of the hry order based on the euclidean distance and then combined this metric with rva to address the potential underestimation of the degree of alteration made by the traditional rva shiau and wu 2008 proposed the application of the hma to address the limitations of the rva approach the hma approach assesses hydrologic regime alteration by using the degree of histogram dissimilarity as a metric which is based on the quadratic form distance between the frequency vectors of the pre impact and post impact histograms weighted by a specific similarity matrix huang et al 2017 lin et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 although a histogram may contain all of the statistical information of an indicator including information about wet average or dry years it still suffers from some limitations that have been discussed in detail in huang et al 2017 to eliminate the limitations of the hma approach huang et al 2017 proposed the hca approach which is also based on the histogram analysis by comparing the pre impact and post impact frequency histograms of an indicator it first calculates the degree of similarity between pre impact and post impact frequency histograms and then deduces the degree of alteration huang et al 2019 yuqin et al 2019 integrated hry and hca to eliminate the potential underestimation of the degree of alteration computed by hca which may occur due to ignoring hydrologic representative years to overcome the limitation of ignoring the morphological characteristic of the time series by the traditional rva zheng et al 2021 developed a method to obtain the morphological alteration of the iha indicators by considering the ordering relationships and magnitude differences of all the elements of hydrologic time series they quantified the morphological alteration of the iha indicators by comparing the hasse matrices of pre and post impact time series and integrated the morphological alteration with frequency alteration obtained by the traditional rva as can be noticed all the above mentioned assessment methods developed and applied in recent years have used the bin counting histogram method to estimate and compare the probability density function pdf of continuous hydrologic variables during the pre and post impact periods although bin counting is a more common and computationally quick method of pdf estimation it suffers from major drawbacks such as subjectivity in the choice of the number or width of bins and replacing data from their individual location to bins data binning which causes the probability histogram shape to become discontinuous and flat in each bin węglarczyk 2018 to address the major shortcomings of the previous hydrological alteration assessment approaches this study proposes two innovative approaches namely weighted range of variability approach weighted rva and density difference approach dda the weighted rva has been proposed to overcome the main drawback of the traditional rva by accounting for alterations beyond the target range that may contain important information although the latest version of the rva tnc 2009 evaluates alteration values for three categories of low medium and high range of rva none of the previous studies reported how to aggregate these three values into a single alteration index for each indicator to calculate the overall degree of the hydrologic alteration we introduce a method to aggregate these three values in the weighted rva approach dda has been proposed to overcome the major drawbacks caused by bin counting histogram that has been used in most of the previous alteration assessment approaches the concept advantages and disadvantages and the calculation procedure of the proposed approaches are explained in the materials and methods section we demonstrate the results of applying these approaches to assess hydrologic alterations in the gharnaveh watershed in northeast of iran where a range of human interventions has changed hydrological processes across the watershed we will also compare the results of the proposed approaches with those of the traditional rva and some introduced methods in the recent thread of developing hydrological alteration analysis approaches including hma hca and maa 2 materials and methods 2 1 iha indicators the iha software program has been developed by the nature conservancy tnc as a tool for calculating the characteristics of natural and altered hydrologic regimes tnc 2009 it summarizes long periods of daily hydrologic data into a much more manageable series of ecologically relevant hydrologic indicators more details about this software program are given in its user s manual tnc 2009 in this study it has been applied to extract the time series of 33 hydrologic indicators in five groups table 1 from 50 years daily discharge data recorded at the tamar hydrometry station as can be noticed from table 1 the iha software covers an extensive and meaningfull range of hydrologic parameters usefull for the hydrological change analysis these parameters account for changes in all key features of a hydrologic regime including magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of chang due to the non normality of the given daily discharge data the non parametric statistics have been selected to calculate the iha indicators 2 2 range of variability approach rva in the rva analysis the range of natural variability of 33 iha indicators during the pre impact period is set as the flow management and restoration targets the rva target range for each indicator is defined as percentile levels for non parametric analysis or a multiple of the indicator s standard deviations for parametric analysis for the pre impact period richter et al 1996 the degree to which the rva target range is not attained during the impact period is considered as an indicator of hydrologic alteration the degree of change or alteration of a given hydrologic indicator di is defined as follows richter et al 1998 peres cancelliere 2016 shiau wu 2006 xue et al 2017 1 d m n o m n e n e m 1 2 33 where dm is the degree of hydrological alteration of the mth indicator no m is the number of years in which the observed value of the iha indicator fell within the target range i e between the 25th and 75th percentiles for the natural or pre impact period and ne is the number of years for which the value of the indicator is expected to fall within the target range based on the frequency of occurrence in the pre impact period it is worth to note that the rva target range can be adopted as any selected percentile levels or as a simple multiple of the parameter s standard deviation for the pre impact period for instance zheng et al 2020 adopted 33rd and 67th percentiles and wang et al 2016 used 16th and 84th percentiles the interquartile range 25th and 75th percentiles however is the most frequently used boundary values for the rva target range richter et al 1998 shiau and wu 2008 ge et al 2018 du et el 2020 in this study ne is assumed equal to 50 of the post impact number of years du et al 2020 the overall degree of the hydrologic alteration is calculated as an average of alteration degree for all indicators as follows singh jain 2021 2 d o r v a m 1 n d m n where do rva is the overall degree of alteration of the flow regime and n is the number of hydrologic indicators the higher the value of do rva the greater the degree of alteration the eq 1 only considers the changes in the frequency of the intermediate values for an iha indictor and neglects the changes in the frequencies of its low and high values this leads to an information loss about the alteration that may occur in the tail values of the probability distribution of an iha indicator principato and viggiani 2012 for example when half of data values for an iha indicator during the post impact period fall in the range of the middle category target range regardless of the frequencies of data values in the low and high categories the traditional rva approach considers no alteration for that indicator however due to alteration in the probability distribution of that iha indicator during the post impact period the frequencies of the data values in the low and high categories may largely deviate from their expected frequency of 25 2 3 weighted range of variability approach weighted rva despite that the latest versions of the iha software program tnc 2009 calculates the rva for three categories of low middle and high values in most of the previous studies lin et al 2016 shi et al 2019 singh jain 2021 the rva for the middle category has been considered as a basis to calculate the degree of alteration in other words the middle category of the iha values has been used as the target range i e between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the pre impact data set in fact the alteration beyond the target range either below the lower bound of the target range or above the upper bound of the target range is neglected shiau wu 2008 while for many hydrological parameters particularly parameters with the skewed distribution the alteration in their low or high values is important principato and viggiani 2012 as mentioned in the introduction section the latest version of the iha software calculates alteration in three categories for each of the 33 iha indicators however there is no reported solution in the literature about how to aggregate them into a single value to indicate the overall degree of alteration to overcome this problem the weighted rva has been proposed in this study to this end we used eq 1 for each category of rva separately and the weighted mean of the alteration for these categories has been calculated as the degree of alteration since the frequency of values in the rva categories i e 0 25 0 5 and 0 25 for the low middle and high rva categories respectively are different the weight for each category has been assigned equal to its frequency however depending on the importance of low middle and high values of the iha indicators in a hydrologic analysis different weights can be assigned to each category provided that their sum is equal to one depending on the distribution of post impact data in three categories the absolute value of alteration degree calculated by the weighted rva might exceed the upper limit of 1 adopted by other approaches therefore to make the result of the weighted rav approach consistent with the other approaches the calculated alteration degree for an iha indicator should be standardized to the range of 0 1 by dividing to the maximum possible value of its alteration degree based on the assigned weights for three categories of rva the maximum possible value of the alteration degree for an iha indicator can be calculated using the following equation 3 maxa w h w l 2 w h 2 w l w m where wl wm and wh indicate weights assigned to the low middle and high categories of rva the main advantages of the weighted rva are inclusion of changes in all categories of rva and preference of the users through assigning weights to each rva category in aggregating them into a single alteration degree however it still suffers from some challenges of the traditional rva such as intuitive selection of the comparative interval target range and the division by zero or a small value due to no or low frequency of the hydrologic variable within the target range of the pre impact period 2 4 histogram matching approach hma shiau and wu 2008 presented a histogram matching approach hma for assessment of the flow regime alteration the central idea behind the hma is that two data sets of an indicator would be similar if their frequency histograms resemble each other the hma uses the degree of histogram dissimilarity as a metric for impact assessment which is based on the quadratic form distance between the frequency vectors of the pre and post impact histograms weighted by a specified similarity matrix the calculation procedure is as follows the number of bins has been calculated by following equation in this study freedman and diaconis 1981 4 nb m r m n m 1 3 2 r mq where nbm is the number of histogram classes rm is the data range which is the difference between the largest and smallest data values nm is the total number of data for mth indicator and rmq is the inter quartile range of the first and third quartiles a quadratic form distance niblack et a 1993 has been employed to measure the dissimilarity between two histograms of pre and post impact periods 5 d q h k h k t a h k where h h1 h2 hnb t and k k1 k2 knb t are the frequency vectors of the pre impact histogram h and the post impact histogram k respectively and h k is the distance vector a aij where aij is the similarity between classes i and j for a linear similarity function the similarity between classes i and j is calculated by following expression shiau and wu 2008 6 a ij 1 d ij d max in which dij vi vj is ground distance between classes i and j where vi and vj are mean values of classes i and j dmax max dij v1 vnb the degree of histogram dissimilarity for the mth hydrologic indicator is determined as follows shiau and wu 2008 7 d hma m d q m 4 2 nb m 1 the overall degree of the hydrologic alteration is calculated as follows shiau and wu 2008 8 d o h m a m 1 n d hma m 2 n where do hma is the overall degree of alteration of the flow regime and n is the number of hydrologic indicators the higher the value of do hma the greater the degree of alteration more detailed information about hma is available in shiau and wu 2008 the major drawbacks of hma are binning the data węglarczyk 2018 and using the quadratic form distance metric proposed by niblack et al 1993 the problems caused by data binning will be discussed in the results and discussion section the quadratic form distance metric proposed by niblack et al 1993 underestimates distances because it tends to accentuate the similarity of probability distributions without a pronounce mode rubner et al 1998 principato and viggiani 2012 2 5 histogram comparison approach hca huang et al 2017 got inspiration from rva and hma to propose the hca approach to quantify the hydrologic alteration of the iha indicators hca considers both class by class correspondence and cross class information the calculation procedure is as follows the number of classes for the histogram is determined in the same way as the hma method using eq 4 the similarity degree sm is defined as follows huang et al 2017 9 s m s m cc s m ci 10 s m cc i 1 nb m m i n h i m k i m 11 s m ci i 1 nb m m i n h w i m k w j m 1 i j nb m where hm h1 m h2 m hnbm m and km k1 m k2 m knbm m are the frequency vectors of histograms hm and km i and j are the original serial numbers of the histogram classes from left to right w is the serial number ordered from largest to smallest according to the frequency vectors in cases where the frequency vectors are the same w is ordered from left to right according to the histogram class s m cc calculates the similarity by comparing the frequency vectors of the same histogram class and reflects the class by class correspondence and s m ci calculates the similarity by comparing the frequency vectors of the same serial number and reflects the cross class information both s m cc and s m ci range between 0 and 1 making sm range between 0 and 1 the degree of alteration for the mth hydrologic indicator is calculated by eq 12 huang et al 2017 12 d hca m 1 s m the overall degree of the hydrologic alteration is calculated as follows huang et al 2017 13 d o h c a m 1 n d hca m 2 n where do hca is the overall degree of alteration of the flow regime and n is the number of hydrologic indicators the higher the value of do hca the greater the degree of alteration more detailed information about hca has been given in huang et al 2017 the major drawback of hca is binning the data that is further discussed in the results and discussion section 2 6 morphological alteration approach maa according to lacasa et al 2015 the ordering position and magnitude of each element in a time series should be considered to uniquely characterize it and its fluctuations lacasa et al 2015 based on this point and to include the morphological alteration of the time series into alteration analysis zheng et al 2021 developed an approach that can consider the ordering relationships and magnitude differences of all the elements the calculation procedure is as follows the magnitude difference of the iha indicators is calculated the same as the traditional rva using eq 1 the hasse matrix h of a sequence of an iha indicator is defined by comparing every two elements of a time series as follows zheng et al 2021 14 h ij 1 i f q i k q j k k 1 2 m i j 1 2 n 1 i f q i k q j k k 1 2 m i j 1 2 n 0 o t h e r w i s e where qi k and qj k are the ith and jth element of the indicators time series for the kth variable e g for a selected iha indicator qi 1 and qi 2 means the ordering variable and magnitude variable for the ith year an iha time series is divided into three ranges by the rva boundaries 25th and 75th percentile of the pre impact period values below the lower boundary are defined as low values within the rva boundaries as middle values and high values above the higher boundary the elements in a time series falling into the low middle and high value ranges are converted to 1 2 and 3 respectively the ordering variable is derived from the time index of the time series 1 for the first year and n for the last year of the time series the magnitude variable is represented by hii pi pmax where pi is the ith converted iha value and pmax is the maximum of all converted ihas which substitutes the diagonal elements of the hasse matrix given a n n pre impact matrix hpre and post impact n n matrix hpost the hasse distance of the two matrices dh pre post is defined by following equations zheng et al 2021 15 d h p r e p o s t 1 w d o p r e p o s t w d d p r e p o s t 16 d d p r e p o s t i 1 n h ii pre h ii post n 17 d o p r e p o s t i 1 n 1 j i 1 n h ij pre h ij post n n 1 2 where dd is the distance due to the diagonal elements of the two matrices while do is the distance due to the off diagonal elements the summations of diagonal elements and off diagonal elements cannot be greater than n and n n 1 2 respectively the resulting dd and do fall into the range from 0 to 1 w has a range of 0 1 and is a weighting parameter determined by the importance of ordering relationships and magnitude differences therefore the range of the hasse distance varies between 0 and 1 a decrease in the hasse distance implies a higher similarity between the two time series in case the length of pre impact n1 and post impact n2 time series are different the associated hasse matrices are denoted as h1 and h2 the hasse distance between h1 and h2 can be calculated by comparing n1 n2 1 times the overlapping part of these two matrices moving the smaller matrix diagonally from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the bigger one the smallest distance among the n1 n2 1 distances is the hasse distance between h1 and h2 in this way the most similar part between pre impact and post impact datasets can be found the overall alteration of mth iha dmo is a combination of the frequency alteration dm and the morphological alteration dhm zheng et al 2021 18 d mo 1 1 d m 1 d hm the overall degree of the hydrologic alteration is calculated as follows zheng et al 2021 19 d o m a a 1 n i 1 n d mo where do maa is the overall degree of alteration of the flow regime and n is the number of hydrologic indicators the higher the value of do maa the greater the degree of alteration more detailed information about maa can be found in zheng et al 2021 the major drawback of maa is a simple aggregation of the frequency alteration and morphological alteration which results in an overestimation of the alteration degree 2 7 density difference approach dda out of all probability distribution functions the probability density function pdf best shows how the whole probability mass is distributed over the values of a random variable węglarczyk 2018 the pdf estimation methods are either parametric or nonparametric the parametric methods assume a parametric model for the underlying pdf of the data they are only suitable when the data are known to follow a presumed distribution however when the underlying distribution is unknown they are inadequate or inappropriate on the other hand the nonparametric methods impose fewer assumptions on the shape of the underlying distribution the kernel density estimation kde was developed more than a half century ago by rosenblatt 1956 and parzen 1962 to derive a smooth empirical pdf based on individual locations of all sample data parzen 1962 rosenblatt 1956 it has gained wide explosion of interest during last decades in many fields of study sheather 2004 we used kde to prepare and compare the density plots of the iha indicators during pre and post impact periods as an index of hydrologic alteration the calculation procedure is as follows the a kernel density estimator with kernel function k for an iha indicator is defined sheather 2004 20 f x 1 n h i 1 n k x x i h where xi is the sample values n is the total number of iha data h is the tunable smoothing parameter window width or bandwidth which governs the amount of smoothing applied to the sample k is the selected kernel density function that is required to satisfy sheather 2004 21 k x d x 1 there are many types of kernel functions of which the most widely used is the gaussian density with infinite support sheather 2004 gong et al 2014 the efficiency of the estimated kernel density depends upon two factors 1 an appropriate choice of the kernel bandwidth and 2 selection of the kernel function latif mustafa 2020 we used the gaussian density function and the silverman s bandwidth in this study silverman 1986 proposes the following equation to estimate the smoothing factor or bandwidth 22 h 0 9 m i n σ iqr 1 34 n 1 5 where σ is the standard deviation of the iha indicator data iqr is the interquartile range of the iha indicator data n is the total number of the iha indicator data this equation is widely used in practice and referred to as the silverman s bandwidth or silverman s rule of thumb sheather 2004 difference in density functions of the pre impact and post impact time series for each iha indicator is calculated with the total variation distance which is well known in probability theory schmid schmidt 2006 and is the most classical concept of distance between probability measures cai lim 2022 23 d d 1 2 f x p r e f x p o s t d x the concept of the above equation is in line with the concept of the mean integrated squared error which is a widely used choice of overall measure of the discrepancy between two probability distributions sheather 2004 since the area under the density plots is equal to one in case of zero overlaps between two density plots the difference between them will be equal to two therefore in the above equation the difference in the densities of the pre and post impact time series has been divided by two to limit the degree of alteration values into the range of 0 to 1 it should be noted that the range of values in two time series is usually different therefore to numerically subtract the probability density functions of two time series their pdfs should be calculated within their unified range from minimum to maximum of two series the overall degree of the hydrologic alteration is calculated as follows huang et al 2017 24 d o d d a m 1 n d d 2 n where do dda is the overall degree of alteration of the flow regime and n is the number of hydrologic indicators the higher the value of do dda the greater the degree of alteration the main advantage of dda includes accounting for the changes in magnitude frequency and order position of all individual data along a time series in the alteration analysis through using and comparing kde the subjective selection of the bandwidth parameter is considered as a major disadvantage of dda the advantages and disadvantages of kde application in real life examples have been thoroughly demonstrated by węglarczyk 2018 2 8 study area the gharnaveh watershed is one of the major subwatersheds of the gorganrud river basin in the golestan province in the northeast of iran it has a total catchment area of 78 500 ha and lies between 37 32 1 n to 37 47 8 n and 55 32 e to 56 1 7 e with an elevation range of 155 to 1420 m a s l the long term mean annual precipitation is 527 mm mostly occurring during november may the topographic edaphic and vegetative conditions of the watershed accompanied by intensive human interferences give rise to a high potential for floods and soil erosion the fertile and fragile deep loess soils on undulating hills and extensive dry farming are dominant characteristics of the watershed following the implementation of national socio economic development plans during the past decades extensive land use change from natural forests and rangelands to croplands has occurred in the country with no exemption of the study area this condition has resulted in an increase in the frequency and magnitudes of floods during 1980 2005 in the study area the deadliest and most devastating floods in the study area occurred in 2001 2002 and 2005 ardalan et al 2009 therefore several small scale earth filled and rock filled concrete dams were implemented across upstream tributaries as watershed management projects the earlier land use changes and later watershed management practices as well as climate change seems to have caused hydrologic regime alteration in the study area therefore this study has aimed to quantify these alterations to shed light on the impacts of anthropogenic interventions on the hydrologic regime of the gharnaveh watershed as a representative of many watersheds across the region with similar challenges mentioned above to achieve this aim daily discharge data recorded in 50 years 1969 2018 at the tamar hydrometry station located near the outlet of the watershed were obtained from the regional water company of the golestan province the construction of earth filled and rock filled concrete dams has been chosen as flood mitigation and gully control strategies and practices by the local authorities responsible for watershed management after the occurrence of large floods in 2002 and 2005 therefore the periods before and after 2005 were marked as the pre and post impact periods respectively the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha software program tnc 2009 was applied to produce the iha indicators time series and rva analysis furthermore the weighted rva hma hca maa and dda alteration analysis approaches were applied to quantify hydrologic regime alteration in the gharnaveh watershed and their results were compared 3 results and discussion the preliminary results of the iha software program indicate that a significant hydrologic regime change has occurred after the implementation of watershed management interventions in response to the devastating flood occurrences in 2001 2002 and 2005 these watershed management practices mainly as earth fill and rock fill cemented dams have been implemented to control or mitigate floods and gully erosion as the major natural hazards in the study area although these practices seem to be successful in mitigating the floods they have been resulted in a significant decrease in the water yield of the gharnaveh watershed fig 2 which comprises the central part of the contributing drainage area to the bostan dam s reservoir fig 1 indeed these hydrologic changes are accompanied by alteration in various ecohydrologically essential indicators the application of the iha software has facilitated summarizing the long term recorded daily discharge data of the tamar hydrometry station into times series of ecologically relevant hydrologic indicators that have been used to assess the hydrologic alteration with different alteration assessment approaches 3 1 analysis of hydrologic alteration using rva and weighted rva the hydrologic alteration for each iha indicator has been calculated at three categories of low middle and high values using the traditional rva and weighted rva fig 3 and table 2 the boundary of these three categories for each iha indicator has been defined based on the target range of the indicator i e the interquartile range iqr of the indicator s data during the pre impact period richter et al 1998 shiau and wu 2008 ge et al 2018 the values within the target range are considered as middle rva category the values below and above the target range are classified as low rva and high rva categories respectively for all the indicators of the groups one and two of iha indicators table 2 which characterize the magnitude of hydrologic changes the frequency of low values has been increased particularly for the minimum flow indicators and monthly flows in the spring and summer seasons which consists of the dry period of the year on the other hand the frequency of their high and middle values has decreased although not as intense as low values the most significant alteration occurred for 1 and 3 day minimum flows and the number of zero flow days the number of zero flow days shows a very large increase for the high rva category among the months the most significant alteration is seen for august the minimum alteration has occurred for the low pulse duration and the occurrence dates of the minimum and maximum daily flows the frequency of large daily shifts from low flows to high flows rise rate has decreased while the frequency of large shifts from high flow to low flows fall rate has increased magnitudes of alteration for the maximum flow indicators are less pronounced than the minimum flow indicators as can be noticed from table 3 for most of the iha indicators particularly for the extreme low flow indicators 1 to 30 day minimum flow indicators baseflow and monthly flows of the driest months of the year july and august the degree of alteration yielded by the weighted rva is higher than the traditional rva approach this is mainly because for the majority of the iha indicators the degree of alteration for the low and high rva categories is greater than the middle rva category which is considered as the target range for the hydrologic alteration calculation in the traditional rva method see table 2 in fact the lower or upper tail values of the iha indicators distribution experience more alteration due to the human interventions and climatic perturbations therefore it can be concluded that the inclusion of all categories of rva in the calculation of hydrologic alteration degree provides more reliable results however the weighted rva is also subjected to the inherent drawback of the rva method which yields non intuitive results for indicators that have a large number of annual statistics equal to a particular value or are divided by a small frequency number a fractional number less than one for instance the 1 and 3 day minimum flow indicators may have many zero values during the post impact period particularly in arid and semi arid environments or the number of zero flow days may be zero or very small for the pre impact period particularly in temperate and humid areas in the case of the former situation the calculated value of the rva will be very large for the low category of rva see for instance in fig 3 the low rva of the 1 and 3 day minimum flows for the latter case either the division by zero occurs which is undefined or the division by a small frequency value which usually results in a very large rva value for the high rva category see for instance in fig 3 the high rva of the zero flow days therefore we excluded the zero flow days indicator from further analysis furthermore the iha indicators were ranked according to their alteration in a descending order table 3 we used the average method for ranking according to this method the average of the ranks for tied values are assigned to all the tied values 3 2 analysis of hydrologic alteration using hma hca and maa in this study the hma hca and maa alteration analysis approaches have been applied to the study area too their results have been included in table 3 as is evident there is a considerable variation in the alteration value range and rank of the iha indicators obtained by different alteration analysis approaches which will be discussed later in this text the hma and hca approaches are based on comparing the frequency histograms of the iha indicators in pre and post impact periods the frequency histograms of the iha indicators for the study area in the pre and post impact periods have been shown in fig 4 this figure clearly demonstrates that for the iha indicators with high alteration degree the dissimilarity of the pre and post impact histograms is very significant as seen there is a great dissimilarity between the pre and post impact histograms for the august monthly discharge 1 3 and 7 day minimum discharges and baseflow indicators regarding the results of the maa approach the alteration values and ranks of the iha indicators are strongly dependent on the given values of the weighting parameter w which determines the importance of morphologic and frequency alterations this finding has been demonstrated in fig 5 as can be noticed changing the value of w in its defined range 0 1 has a less pronounced effect on the variation of the iha indicators with high alteration values and low alteration ranks in this study the importance of the morphologic and frequency alterations has been considered equal w 0 5 the maa approach uses the hasse distance between two hasse matrices of the pre and post impact time series to depict their morphological difference zheng et al 2021 as a sample the hasse matrices for monthly discharges of august and may respectively with high and low alteration values have been presented in appendix a 3 3 analysis of hydrologic alteration using dda the frequency densities of the 32 iha indicators in the pre and post impact periods have been displayed in fig 6 as seen the density plots of the pre and post impact periods for the august monthly flow 1 3 7 and 30 day minimum flows and base flow indicators show the highest dissimilarity these are the iha indicators with the highest alteration values according to all the applied alteration analysis approaches on the other hand the density plots of the pre and post impact periods for the march monthly flow high pulse counts dates of minimum and maximum flows and low pulse length present the highest similarity since the area under the probability density plots is equal to one subtraction of two density functions for the pre and post impact time series of an iha indicator provides a sound method to quantify the difference between them as an alteration degree the results of the application of this procedure for 32 iha indicators at the tamar hydrometry station have been presented in fig 7 this figure clearly shows that for which value of an indicator along the x axis how much and in which direction negative or positive the alteration has occurred as shown in fig 7a for all months of the year the frequency of low discharges has increased during the post impact period on the contrary the frequency of high discharges for the majority of months except for the winter season has decreased considering the extreme flows the frequency of very low values for the minimum flow indicators has extremely increased during the post impact period fig 7b for the maximum flow indicators although the frequency of their low values has slightly increased the frequency of their very high values except for 30 and 90 day maximum flows has also negligibly increased fig 7b on the other hand the frequency of their moderate values has slightly decreased during the post impact period the dates of minimum and maximum flows showed the least alteration fig 7b the results of the dda approach for the hydrological fluctuation indicators frequency duration and rate of changes indicate that the high pulse duration rise rate and fall rate indicators have undergone the largest alteration respectively fig 7c the frequency of the high number of low and high pulses has slightly increased and vice versa the frequency of high absolute rate of changes has increased for both the rise and fall rates and vice versa this indicates that the hydrologic response of the study area has tended towards a flashier condition in the post impact period this can also be deduced from the alteration pattern of reversals whereas the frequency of a high number of reversals has increased during the post impact period 3 4 comparing the results of alteration approaches to compare the conformity of different alteration analysis approaches the pearson s correlation analysis has been carried out among the alteration values obtained by applying different alteration analysis approaches the correlation results have been presented in fig 8 moreover we calculated the correlation of the results of the applied alteration approaches with the changes in the median values of the iha indicators during pre and post impact periods the highest pairwise correlations have been revealed between the traditional rva and maa and between hma and hca these results are not so unexpected given that the maa approach integrates the morphologic alteration to the frequency alteration calculated with the traditional rva and the similarity of the hma and hca approaches in using the frequency histograms to calculate the alteration degree both of the proposed approaches in this research i e the weighted rva and dda exhibit the most conformity with other approaches although the correlation values between the weighted rva and other approaches are slightly higher than the correlation values between the dda and other approaches the weighted rva suffers from the limitations attributed to the traditional rva approach huang et al 2017 shiau wu 2008 zheng et al 2021 therefore it can be concluded that the dda approach outperforms other approaches the hma and hca approaches show a very high correlation with each other however they particularly hca show the least conformity with other approaches also there is the highest correlation between the iha indicators median change and alteration values calculated by weighted rva approach followed by dda rva and maa approaches the least correlation exists between the iha indicators median change and alteration values calculated by the hca and hma approaches hma and hca are subject to the main disadvantage of the histogram known as the bin edge problem wand and jones 1994 which might result in the distribution shape skewness reversal due to changes in bin locations weber 2008 another disadvantage of the histogram estimators is that they display bumps in frequencies that may have been observed only due to noise zambom and dias 2013 in histogram based approaches even when two time series show equal frequency for all bins we cannot say they are similar because the degree of their dispersion inside bins may be different kim 2009 despite being rooted in the histogram methodology the bin edge problem is not shared by the kernel density estimation zambom and dias 2013 furthermore the kernel density estimator shows several advantages over commonly used histograms węglarczyk 2018 it better exhibits the details of the pdf such as multimodality which might occur for pdf of some data sets it uses all sample points locations which helps to better reveal the information contained in the sample the bias of the kernel estimator is of one order better than that of a histogram estimator sheather 2004 however it exhibits an undesirable case when the variable under study is nonnegative and a part of its data lies near zero when this condition happens the probability leakage below zero may occur particularly if a higher value for the band width is assigned węglarczyk 2018 two possible remedies to this drawback are to logarithmize the data or to use an assymetric kernel węglarczyk 2018 however for the densities comparison objective this drawback can be disregarded as has been presented in table 3 the variation among the alteration values obtained for 32 iha indicators using the hma and hca approaches is less pronounced compared to the other approaches the highest standard deviation of alteration values for 32 iha indicators has been observed for the weighted and traditional rva approaches respectively a significant portion of the very high value of the standard deviation in the case of the weighted rva approach can be attributed to the 1 and 3 day minimum flow indicators that attained very high values of alteration degree for the low rva category see table 2 this has been stated as a drawback of the rva approach when encountering a large number of annual statistics equal to a particular value such as zero tnc 2009 in case of the gharnaveh watershed due to the implementation of many earth filled dams across the upper tributaries the frequency of low flows and no flow days has markedly increased in the recent years because the watershed s surface runoff is retained in the reservoirs of the constructed dams on the other hand the watershed is dominantly covered by deep loess deposits and there exists no actual aquifer to be recharged most of the ponded water in the reservoirs evaporated back into the air resulting in increase in the frequency of low flows and zero flow days in downstreams the abovementioned drawback is aggravated when the number of data in the post impact period is considerably less than in the pre impact period when this happens the expected frequency for the rva categories particularly for the low or high categories may become an absolute fractional number less than one resulting in absolute alteration values larger than 3 which is logically unacceptable for instance as can be noticed from table 2 and fig 3 for 1 and 3 day minimum flow in the low rva category and number of zero flow days in the high rva category the alteration values are unacceptably large therefore care should be taken to this limitation when using the weighted rva method as seen in table 3 exclusion of 1 and 3 day minimum flow indicators from the alteration analysis using the weighted rva will decrease the mean and standard deviation of the alteration values to 0 47 and 0 23 which bring them into the range of the results of other alteration analysis approaches inclusion of the low and high rva categories changes in the weighted rva approach despite logical from a theoretical point of view might practically limit its application to those iha indicators which suffer from the abovementioned conditions the range and standard deviation of the iha indicators alteration values for maa and dda are close to each other but the mean value of the alterations is higher for the maa approach this can mainly be attributed to integrating the morphologic alteration to the frequency alteration in the maa approach followed by dda the alteration degrees from the maa approach shows the most conformity with the alteration degrees from other approaches however there is no straightforward guide on how to assign the value of the weighting parameter w that has significant effects on the calculation of the alteration value particularly for the iha indicators with moderate alteration comparing the alteration values of the iha indicators groups in the gharnaveh watershed shows that the most alteration has occurred for the group two magnitude and duration of annual extreme water conditions and five rate and frequency of water condition changes the least alteration has been observed for group three timing of annual extreme water conditions and four frequency and duration of high and low pulses within group two the low extreme indicators have experienced the most alteration while the high extreme indicators have shown less alteration also within group one magnitude of monthly water conditions the dry months july and august exhibit high alteration values these results indicate that although the implementation of the earth filled and rock fill cemented dams has mitigated the magnitude of floods it has resulted in a significant alteration in the hydrologic regime worsening the ecohydrological condition of the watershed this conclusion can be supported by the large values of the alteration degree attained by the low extreme flow indicators particularly the baseflow indicator which is a very important indicator from an ecohydrological point of view the length of the data used for the pre and post impact periods were 37 and 13 years respectively although according to silvermam 1986 the number of data points required to get a reliable density estimate grows exponentially with dimensionality this is not a concern for the dda approach that uses univariate one dimensional timeseries silverman 1986 suggested that four points is enough for accurate kde for one dimensional data botta dukat and lukacs 2021 indicated that at least 10 20 individuals should be measured to fit a kde to a single trait however like with other statistical analysis methods the larger the sample size the closer the fit of kde to the actual distribution and the more robust the result of the dda approach will be 3 5 evaluating the performance of alteration approaches in detecting alteration in key parameters of the probability distribution alteration in a hydrologic time series may occur as changes in different parameters of the probability distribution location dispersion and asymmetry are the most important parameters in probability theory and statistics to assess the ability of the studied alteration analysis approaches in quantifying the changes in the probability distribution parameters a normally distributed example series of 1000 records using the mean and standard deviation values of the october discharge data µ 0 8 and sd 0 3 m3 sec of the tamar hydrometry station has been randomly generated as the base series then its location mean and dispersion standard deviation parameters were changed as much as 50 percent to generated the s1 to s4 example series furthermore a right skewed s5 series and a left skewed s6 series normally distributed series were generated with the same standard deviation values as the base series but with location values of 0 4 and 1 2 and shape alpha parameters of 10 and 10 respectively fig 9 shows the probability densities of these randomly generated example series and table 4 summarizes their descriptive statistics since the number of records 1000 was limited the mean and standard deviations of the randomly generated example series are slightly different from their expected values the alteration degrees due to changes in the mean standard deviation and skewness of the base series have been calculated with the studied alteration analysis approaches and summarized in table 5 and presented in fig 10 the results of the alteration analysis approaches are different for the example series for the changes in the first moment mean base s3 and base s4 although still remarkable the variation in the alteration degree calculated with different approaches is less pronounced compared to the changes in the second standard deviation base s1 and base s2 and third skewness base s5 and base s6 moments the variance among the results of different approaches is more pronounced for the changes in the standard deviation particularly when its value is reduced generally speaking the maa approach overestimates the alteration degree this is mainly because it adds the morphological alteration to the frequency alteration calculated by the traditional rva approach another noticeable result is that the direction of change increase or decrease in the first and third moments rarely affects the alteration value calculated with the hma hca and dda approach while for the second moment and other approaches the direction of change markedly affects the alteration degree the intersection overlapping area between two probability density functions is widely used as the similarity index and thus the non overlapping area can be used as the distance dissimilarity index cha 2007 pastore and calcagni 2019 cai and lim 2022 therefore the overlap index ovl between the s1 to s6 series and the base series has been computed with the baysetestr package makowski et al 2019 and subtracted from 1 to obtain the non overlap value novl as the index of dissimilarity the overlapping and nonoverlapping indices for the paired densities of the s1 to s6 series with the base series have been included in table 5 as seen the nonoverlap index resulting from the baysetestr is almost the same as the dda approach s result accordingly it can be concluded that the dda approach outperforms regardless the type of the changes occurred in the distribution properties the subjective estimation of the bandwidth parameter in the dda approach using the silverman s rule of thumb may undemine the performance of it therefore to evaluate the effect of the bandwidth parameter on the dda results a sensitivity analysis has been carried out the results indicated that the alteration degree calculated by dda is not very sensitive to the bandwidth parameter fig 11 4 conclusions the combined application of the rva alteration analysis approach and the iha indicators is the usual routine to assess hydrological alterations however the traditional rva suffers from some limitations therefore several adjustments and alternatives viz hma hca and maa have been proposed in the literature in this study we proposed two alternative alteration analysis approaches including the weighted rva and dda and applied them for the time series of iha indicators at the tamar hydrometry station near the outlet of the gharnaveh watershed in northeast of iran their results were compared with the results of the traditional rva hma hca and maa approaches the main conclusions of this study are summarized as follows a high level of hydrologic alteration has occurred following the implementation of flood control structural measures in the gharnaveh watershed it should be noted that the calculated alteration values are the combined effects of anthropogenic interventions and climate change further research is required to separate these effects the weighted rva approach proposed in this study resulted in higher alteration values compared to the traditional rva as it accounts for alteration in all rva categories the dda approach proposed in this study compares the continuous pdf of two time series to reveal their difference comparing the continuous pdfs ensures that changes in magnitude frequency and order position of all individual data are considered in alteration analysis this is a very distinct advantage of dda compared to the other used approaches although the empirical selection of the smoothing factor or bandwidth is considered as an important downside of kde the final result of the dda approach is not so sensitive to the bandwidth changes we suggest dda as a superior hydrologic alteration analysis approach this has been supported by a theoretical analysis on example random data sets demonstrating excellent performance of dda in terms of accurately detecting and calculating the alteration in important parameters of the probability distribution functions including location dispersion and skewness in many watersheds particularly in developing and non developed regions there is not enough data to adequately perform the assessment of hydrological alterations in these cases mixed use of the hydrologic simulation and water resources optimization and allocation models can generate appropriate data sets to analyze the hydrological alterations caused by different management alternatives intended by the water resources decision makers and managers pardo loaiza et al 2021 in this context soft computing techniques such as evolutionary algorithms ehteram et al 2018 artificial neural networks taormina et al 2015 machine learning fotovatikhah et al 2018 shamshirband et al 2020 and deep learning fu et al 2020 have been demonstrated to be promising techniques particularly suited for prediction and optimization of future hydrologic conditions due to human interventions furthermore a subjective component pertinent to all alteration analysis approaches which still not explicitly addressed in the literature is the equal weights assigned to all iha indicators to calculate the overall hydrologic alteration degree there is no robust rationale to assign equal weights to the iha indicators future research could for instance investigate how to assign a weight for each iha indicator based on its importance and to assess hydrologic alterations in watersheds with scarce or no recorded discharge data such research could contribute to assisting water resource managers and decision makers design watershed management restoration and
