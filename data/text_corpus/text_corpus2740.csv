13700,using magnetic sorbents to pollutants eliminations seem to be an efficient easy to apply and low cost technique however the majority of studies focus on the study of sorption properties using model solutions and research on actual wastewater is largely missing therefore this study aims to assess the application of magnetically modified montmorillonite mmt to eliminate zn ii cd ii and pb ii cations from metallurgical waste leachates first model solutions were prepared to describe the properties of mmt sorption kinetic and isotherm models the determined elimination efficiency was higher than 98 the qmax values were in model solutions determined to be 34 3 2 84 and 7 25 mg g for zn ii cd ii and pb ii respectively then the mmt was applied in order to eliminate of zn ii cd ii and pb ii ions from actual metallurgical waste leachates the experimental data obtained from the metallurgical waste leachates corresponded with the data obtained from the model solutions the equilibrium metal uptake capacities obtained by heavy metals adsorption from model solution and metallurgical waste leachates followed the order zn ii pb ii cd ii for dust leachates and zn ii cd ii pb ii for converter sludge leachates which directly corresponds with the heavy metal ions concentration in the leachates moreover the elimination of zn ii cd ii and pb ii by mmt was higher than 98 even in the fifth recycling experiment cycle after the sorption the sorbent was still magnetically active facilitating its removal from the solution mmt proved to be an efficient and regenerable sorbent applicable for wastewater treatment keywords magnetic montmorillonite metallurgical waste leachates sorption heavy metals recycling 1 introduction the production of steel by electric arc furnaces eaf is independent on the production of pig iron and allows the production of different steel grades using scrap metal as a batch in a fully automated operation use of eaf leads to worldwide production of 5 7 million tonnes of dust per year the dust usually collected by bag filters or electrostatic precipitators 1 the chemical composition of the dust depends on the chemical composition of the scrap with the increasing portion of galvanised steel parts being used in the automotive industry the portion of scrap containing zn collected by eaf increases as well therefore the portion of zn could reach up to 46 wt 0 3 6 wt of pb 0 01 0 2 wt of cd 20 35 wt of fe and 0 2 0 7 wt of cr 2 3 both converter sludge and dust are fine grained hazardous waste materials with a negative impact on the environment due to high content of heavy metals pb zn cd and other elements cu s cl f na k rendering their recycling impossible 4 therefore after their stabilisation they are deposited in landfills for hazardous wastes industrial mining and agricultural activities together with vehicle emissions are major sources of the heavy metals in wastewaters 5 6 heavy metals gradually accumulate in the environment they can also be transformed into organometallic compounds which are far more toxic than their precursors 7 after their accumulation in bottom sediments they tend to move up to the food chain 8 zinc cadmium and lead are all heavy metals detrimental to human health for example zinc induces cell death and alteration in brain tissues which contributes to a wide range of diseases mainly alzheimer s and parkinson s disease or lateral sclerosis 9 exposure to cadmium can cause cancer 10 and lead is neurotoxic and leads to multiorgan damages 11 their elimination from wastewaters is of utmost importance the research of new procedures of waste management has been a topical issue for a long time heavy metals can be removed from aqueous solutions by several techniques such as chemical precipitation ion exchange reverse osmosis electrodialysis or sorption 12 13 sorption seems to be more advantageous than conventional techniques mainly due to its relative simplicity low impact on the environment and cost effectiveness surface coatings of the used adsorbent can lead to other beneficial properties of the material such as good thermal stability physical and electrical properties or high saturation magnetisation 14 the key benefit of magnetic modification is that the adsorbent gains ferromagnetic properties and following the sorption it can be together with adsorbed pollutants easily removed from the solution using a magnetic field 15 16 iron oxide fexoy nanoparticles nps have broad application potential in medicine 17 catalysis 18 environmental application 19 or magnetoresponsive nanosystems 20 moreover fexoy nps in lower than 30 40 nm size exhibit superparamagnetic response and reversibly transition between a pseudoparamagnetic state and a pseudoferromagnetic state in the magnetic field 21 the fexoy nps prepared by precipitation usually consist of feo fe2o3 and fe3o4 in magnetically modified composites 22 23 all of these oxides excel in both their superparamagnetic behaviour below 30 nm and biocompatibility following the removal of the magnetic field fexoy nps lose their magnetic properties which prevents the self aggregation of nps their specific surface area is thus not affected and they are therefore suitable for all kinds of biomedical applications and bioseparations 24 26 the fexoy nps have become due to their convenient properties a component in various types of composites especially those applied in wastewater treatment 27 29 for the presented study we chose montmorillonite mt as an experimental sorbent due to its excellent sorption properties for a wide range of pollutants namely heavy metals 30 32 and organic compounds 33 34 relatively large surface area cation exchange capacity low cost and local origin and availability czech republic the elimination of pollutants using mt can take place through ion exchange in the interlayer space where permanent negative charges lead to the formation of outer sphere complexes with metal ions or by the formation of inner sphere complexes on sio and alo groups at the clay particle edges 35 the exact mechanism of these processes depends on many environmental factors such as ph temperature time ionic strength type of sorbent ions or presence of ligands 36 37 various magnetic composites such as geopolymer fe3o4 38 clay fe3o4 and chitosan clay fe3o4 39 montmorillonite magnetic clay nps and organically modified montmorillonite magnetic clay nps 32 or hydroxyapatite magnetite composite 40 were used as efficient adsorbents for removal of cu ii pb ii ni ii cd ii hg ii 38 as iii as v cr vi 39 and co ii 32 from aqueous solutions the magnetic modification is known not to decrease the sorption capacity of the original clays 32 38 39 the elimination of heavy metals cations and pollutants has been an object of many surveys however only a few focused on actual wastewaters are available therefore in this study we used wastewater obtained from either metallurgical sludge or dust for the study of elimination of zn ii cd ii and pb ii ions by mmt we compared the experimental sorption data obtained from metallurgical waste leachates with the data obtained from sorption study in model solutions ms prepared from heavy metals salts excellent sorption properties of a sorbent are not the only attribute required its reusability is a critical factor as well thus we tested the regenerability of mmt for five adsorption desorption cycles 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of magnetic montmorillonite 2 1 1 material as a substrate for fexoy nanoparticles we used montmorillonite mt si3 99al0 01 al1 32fe iii 0 16mg0 50ti0 02 o10 oh 2 ca0 16k0 04na0 12 originating from ivančice czech republic a half unit cell chemical composition of the original mt was determined by bulk chemical analysis this mt is one of the purest natural montmorillonites on the world it does not contain admixtures and thus it does not need to be modified prior to the application the cation exchange capacity of this mt was determined 0 76 meq g in a previous study 41 the specific surface area was measured by sorptomatic 1990 using nitrogen and calculated by the advance data processing software according to the bet isotherm the specific surface area was determined to be 122 m2 g for mt while the value of the cumulative micropore volume was 0 055 m3 g and following the magnetic modification increased to 142 m2 g for mmt while the cumulative micropore volume was 0 063 m3 g 2 1 2 chemicals feso4 7h2o per analyses mach chemikálie s r o ostrava czech

method the suspension containing fexoy nps was prepared by precipitation from the iron hydroxide solution after the elimination of so4 2 ions by decantation evidence reaction using bacl2 the suspension was mixed with deionised water and dried mt finally the mixture was filtered the following day the procedure may be summarised as follows 1 m i c r o w a v e f e x o y n p s m t f i l t r a

described in more detail in 22 2 2 characterisation of material 2 2 1 morphological analysis the secondary transmission electron microscope stem images of native mt and mmt fig 1 were obtained using

details were taken by a secondary electron detector in the bright field mode 2 2 2 magnetic properties magnetisation curves of native mt and mmt both before and after sorption were measured at room

concentration of cd ii pb ii or zn ii ions 2 3 2 preparation of sorption solutions the first step of the study of adsorption properties of mmt was the preparation of solutions modelling the concentration of heavy metals in real leachates the initial concentration of observed heavy metals cations was based on concentrations determined in real metallurgical waste leachates previously 43 the model solutions containing a mixture of heavy metals were prepared in 1 5 2040 mg l concentrations range for zn ii cd ii and pb ii in the ms the initial concentrations of heavy metals in ms and initial ph of ms are presented in table 1 this step enables the description of the adsorption properties of cd ii pb ii or zn ii ions on the mmt before testing the sorption of heavy metals from metallurgical waste leachates moreover the determined heavy metals concentrations in prepared solutions show the impact the initial concentrations have on the sorption process a multi metal solution containing 10 mg l of zn ii cd ii and pb ii was prepared to investigate the sorption process on mmt and sorption properties were compared with original mt 2 3 3 preparation of metallurgical wastes leachates converter sludge cs and dust d samples were leached following the european technical standard en 12457 2 44 mixtures with solid to liquid ratio 1 10 were shaken in discontinuous rotation container at a constant speed 4 5 rpm at laboratory temperature for 24 h the leachates were filtered through 0 45 μm filter paper and ph of leachates gryf 158 and concentrations of zn cd pb and fe ions in final extracts were determined using atomic emission spectrometer with inductively coupled plasma aes icp spectro arcos spectro analytical instruments inc germany 2 4 kinetic and adsorption test batch sorption experiments were carried out in plastic flasks at laboratory temperature 0 1 0 01 g of mmt was mixed with 25 ml of ms containing a mixture of cd ii pb ii and zn ii ions table 1 the adsorbent dose and volume of ms were chosen based on our previous experiments 45 the mixtures were shaken at a constant speed 28 rpm for 2 h after the shaking the mixture was filtered through a 0 23 μm pore filter pragopor 8 pragochema spol s r o concentrations of cd ii pb ii and zn ii ions in the filtrate were determined by aes icp the sorption properties of mmt cs and d were tested on 0 1 g of mmt and 25 ml of metallurgical waste leachates in 0 5 48 h interval the monitored elements zn cd pb and fe were determined after filtration in final extracts by aes icp the equilibrium metal uptake capacity was calculated according to eq 2 2 q e v c 0 c e m where qe mg g is the amount of contaminant removed from the solution c0 and ce are the concentrations of the metal ions in the initial solution and at the equilibrium after the sorption experiment mg l respectively v is volume of the solution l and m is the sorbent dose g in the mixture pseudo first 46 pfo eq 3 and pseudo second order 47 pso eq 4 equations were used to explore the kinetics of zn ii cd ii and pb ii ions adsorption on the mmt from cs and d leachates 3 log q e q log q e k 1 t 2 303 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant 1 min and k2 is the adsorption rate constant of the pseudo second order kinetic model g mg min the initial adsorption behaviour can be expressed by weber intraparticle diffusion model written as 5 q t k i t 1 2 c where ki is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant mg g min0 5 and c mg g is the intercept providing information on the thickness of the boundary layer of sorbent 48 49 the so called characteristic curve based on the intra particle diffusion ipd model can be expressed as 50 6 r i q r e f c q r e f 1 c q r e f where ri is defined as the initial adsorption factor of the ipd model and can be represented in terms of the ratio of the initial adsorption amount c to the final adsorption amount qref qref mg g is the solid phase concentration in the longest time of adsorption process 50 sorption of zn ii cd ii and pb ii from model solutions on the mmt was examined by freundlich and lagmuir isotherms in their non linear form 51 52 as well 2 5 regenerability test to evaluate the regenerability of mmt a laboratory prepared multi metal solution containing 10 mg l of zn ii cd ii and pb ii ions was used according to the previously published studies minerals acids provide efficient desorption properties 53 55 hence for the regenerability experiment 0 1 m hcl was selected due to the high metal desorption properties 56 57 0 1 g of mmt was mixed with 25 ml multi metal solution and shaken as is described in the section on adsorption test the concentrations of zn ii cd ii and pb ii were determined using icp aes after the sorption procedure the mmt was mixed with 25 ml 0 1 m hcl and shaken for 2 h the released concentrations of zn ii cd ii and pb ii were determined by aes icp after the desorption experiment the mmt was washed by deionised water until it achieved ph 6 dried at laboratory temperature and weighed then it was used for subsequent adsorption desorption cycle procedure the solid to liquid ratio 0 1 mg of mmt to 25 ml of solution was preserved in all cycles the efficiency of the removal of zn ii cd ii and pb ii was calculated as follows 57 7 re amount of metal desorbed in one cycle amount of metal loaded in one cycle x 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological and edx analysis of mmt comparison of the detailed stem images of the native mt fig 1a and mmt fig 1b reveals a difference in surface details the surface of mmt consisted of more rounded clusters particles than the surface of the native mt the detailed image shows that fexoy nps of irregular shape and different size are found on the mmt surface characterisation of mt and mmt using xrpd vibrating sample magnetometer scanning electron microscope and edax was published in more details in our previous article 45 3 2 elimination of heavy metals from the multi element solution fig 2 shows the effect of the zn ii pb ii and cd ii combination and the influence of the initial concentrations of these metals in ms on their elimination by mmt initial ph of ms was determined to be in 5 06 5 33 range which is favourable for zn ii cd ii and pb ii adsorption 58 59 removal of zn ii by mmt from ms1 ms10 was unaffected by the presence of cd ii and pb ii ions and their initial concentrations the percentage of zn ii removed by mmt achieved almost 100 in the whole concentration range 1 2000 mg l the efficiency of pb ii and cd ii elimination was influenced by the increased concentration of heavy metals in the initial solutions especially of zn ii the elimination of pb ii by mmt from ms was still efficient when the concentration of zn ii was lower than 250 mg l in the initial solution ms6 when the concentration exceeded 20 mg l of zn ii and 10 mg l of pb ii in the initial solution ms4 the elimination of cd ii decreased this decrease is caused by the fixed number of active sites of the mmt adsorbent as well as high concentrations of adsorbed elements that lead to saturation of the active sites 60 for the explanation of the mmt facilitated heavy metals elimination model solutions with various combination of initial heavy metals concentration were prepared the initial concentrations of the metals in the prepared ms11 14 are presented in table 1 the equilibrium metal uptake capacity removal efficiency and their comparison with ms9 and ms10 are presented in the table 2 final ph of ms after sorption experiments decreased to 4 09 4 95 see fig s1 in supplementary data the generation of protons probably caused this during the adsorption process reversing the ph towards the acidic levels 35 it had been assumed that oh ions could compete for zn ii with the active sites on the adsorbent surface at higher ph values 13 61 however in the case of ms11 ms14 where the initial ph values of ms were the same as the initial ph of ms1 ms10 only 13 5 of zn ii were removed by mmt therefore we did not confirm this assumption the elimination of zn ii from ms11 ms14 was affected by the higher initial concentration of cd ii and pb ii ions the ionic radius of study heavy metals cations decrease as follows pb ii 0 119 nm cd ii 0 097 nm zn ii 0 074 nm 62 therefore based on their ionic radius the higher affinity to mmt should be pb ii than cd ii and zn ii this precondition was verified on the mmt in our previous study 45 based on this study and aforementioned experiments the efficiency of mmt facilitated removal of zn ii cd ii and pb ii from ms depended on the initial concentrations of these metals in the ms this effect is caused by the concentration gradient of heavy metals cations present in the mixtures to demonstrate the mechanism of heavy metals sorption onto mmt we applied original mt and mmt to eliminate heavy metals from a multi component solution containing 10 mg l of zn ii cd ii and pb ii the equilibrium metal uptake capacity and removal of zn ii cd ii and pb ii from multi component solution was the same for mt and mmt table s1 in supplementary data the following adsorption trend was observed pb ii zn ii cd ii which corresponds with both our previous results 45 and the results reported by 63 where the sorption trend from the two component solution was zn ii cd ii it can be assumed that cation exchange mechanism took part in the sorption process therefore the concentrations of na k mg and ca released during the sorption experiment from mt and mmt were determined table s2 in supplementary data the concentrations of na k mg and ca released during the sorption by mt were slightly higher than those when mmt was applied the cations were released from mmt during the preparation therefore the determined concentrations were lower than those from mt after sorption experiment it can be concluded that zn ii cd ii and pb ii sorption onto mt and mmt follows the same mechanism and that there was no effect of fexoy nps presence on the sorption process based on the structure of mt surface we can propose that the adsorption of zn ii cd ii and pb ii on the mt and mmt take place partly by cation exchange mechanism table s2 and by the formation of complexes on sio and alo groups at the clay particle edges adsorption sites on the clay surface and edges are deprotonated when alkalinity increases and are ready to adsorb heavy metals cations 35 adsorption may be described by equation eq 8 where protons are generated and would reverse ph towards the acidic side 35 8 s oh m2 h2o s o moh2 2h moreover fe o could act as a lewis base and can coordinate with zn ii cd ii pb ii to form inner sphere complexes 64 partial protonation of feo to feoh at ph 5 could also lead to both inner and outer sphere complexations with metal cations 64 these presumptions correspond with the decrease of ph values following sorption experiment using ms1 ms14 fig s1 in supplementary data the sorption of zn ii pb ii and cd ii ions on mmt from the solution modelling real concentration of metallurgical waste leachates is presented in fig 2 d f the experimental data were fitted by freundlich and langmuir isotherm models in the non linear form the maximum sorption capacity of mmt was determined to be 34 32 mg g 2 84 mg g and 7 25 mg g for zn ii cd ii and pb ii ions respectively table 3 experimental data correlated well with both the langmuir and freundlich equations however the freundlich adsorption model fit for the cd ii adsorption better r2 0 99 than the langmuir adsorption model r2 0 94 on the other hand the adsorption of both zn ii and cd ii ions on the mmt was described better by langmuir isotherm the 1 n value was lower than 1 indicating that the adsorption of zn ii cd ii and pb ii on the mmt is favourable 65 the separation factor rl 0 rl 1 determined that the adsorption process of zn ii pb ii and cd ii ions from model solution on the mmt was favourable as well 66 the concentrations of fe released to the final extracts after sorption experiments were determined as well using aes icp the concentrations of fe released to the solutions after sorption experiments were lower than 0 14 mg l which corresponds to 0 04 mg g the magnetic properties of mmt after sorption experiments were verified by a magnet fig s2 in supplementary data 3 3 characterisation of metallurgical waste leachates metallurgical waste leachates were obtained per european technical standard en 12457 2 44 preparation of leachates was described in more details in the preceding section 2 2 the concentrations of zn ii pb ii and cd ii in the leachates obtained from converter sludge cs determined by aes icp were 10 4 mg l 7 04 mg l and 0 57 mg l for zn ii cd ii and pb ii and final ph of leachate was determined to be 6 89 in the leachates obtained from dust d the determined concentrations were 1200 mg l 22 mg l and 3 91 mg l for zn ii cd ii and pb ii respectively while the final ph was 6 16 3 3 1 effect of the phase contact time the values of adsorbed percentage re of pb ii exceeded 98 cs leachates and 70 d leachates the constant value of equilibrium metal uptake capacity of cd ii ions removed by mmt from both leachates was achieved within 2 h fig 3 a b the maximum adsorption capacity of pb ii 92 5 was achieved after 2 h as reported by 67 as well the zn ii ions amount adsorbed on mmt form cs leachates increased with increasing contact time for the cs leachates the percentage of heavy metals adsorbed on mmt was higher for than for the d leachates which was probably caused by the filling of the mmt adsorption sites by heavy metals present in d leachates comparison of mmt adsorbed pollutants from metallurgical waste leachates and from the prepared model solutions is shown in table 4 the qmax and re values were higher for the heavy metals cations sorption from ms than for their sorption from metallurgical waste leachates the higher values were caused by the presence of other elements in cs and d leachates on the other hand the elimination of heavy metals cations from metallurgical waste leachates especially cs by mmt was efficient the qmax values of similar types of adsorbents are presented in table 5 the lower values qmax of cd ii and pb ii determined in present work in comparison with results of other authors were influenced by its sorption from multi metal solution the maximum adsorption capacity of similar adsorbents was determined due to sorption from single metal solution moreover the qmax value is influenced by the initial concentrations of the pollutants as present tables 2 and 5 3 4 kinetic parameters the k2 and qe parameters of the pso kinetic model were calculated based on eq 3 and are presented in table 6 the coefficients of determination r2 obtained for the pso kinetic model were greater than 0 97 for all metal ions adsorbed on mmt from cs leachates and greater than 0 98 for metal ions besides cd ii from d leachates fig 3 c d the pso kinetic model is a convenient expression for the representation of the sorption of heavy metals from cs leachates and zn ii and pb ii ions from d leachates on the mmt although pb ii ion radius is greater than the radius of cd ii and zn ii ions the molar conductivity values 1 2 pb2 71 10 4 m2 s mol predict pb ii as the fastest adsorbed ion from metallurgical waste leachates on the mmt 62 this prediction was confirmed by the constant value of the pso rate determined in cs leachates as well however in the case of d leachates the highest pso rate constant was determined for zn ii 1 2 zn2 52 8 10 4 m2 s mol 62 the higher k2 value of zn ii was caused mainly by its concentration gradient in comparison with cd ii and pb ii this was confirmed in the aforementioned experiments with model solutions the pfo kinetic model did not fit the experimental data as well as the pso kinetic model the pfo kinetic model coefficients of determination had lower values than the pso kinetic model and therefore it is not presented the plots of the intraparticle diffusion model ipd fig 3 e f were not linear over the whole time the plot did not pass through the origin hence the adsorption was influenced to some degree by the boundary layer 76 there were either one or three parts of the curve controlling the rate of molecule adsorption but only one of them was limiting step the first slope of the linear part indicated the adsorption rate the second part is probably the diffusion into mesopores and the third part refers to the adsorption into micropores the limiting step of zn ii and cd ii ions adsorption from the cs leachate was probably the adsorption into mmt pores the portion of the plots of pb ii ions adsorption from both leachates was nearly parallel did not pass through the origin the pb ii elimination by mmt was higher than 97 from cs leachates and higher than 70 from d leachates and ri value was lower than 0 1 hence it can be concluded that the process was mainly controlled by strongly initial adsorption these differences are caused by the size of the molecules and the varying initial concentrations 50 the following trend of adsorption amount was observed zn ii cd ii pb ii for cs leachates and zn ii pb ii cd ii for d leachates adsorption was directly related to the initial heavy metal concentration in cs and d leachates this trend corresponds with the results obtained by sorption of heavy metals from ms1 14 the same adsorption trend was observed during the sorption of heavy metals from automobile effluent on the mt 31 this effect is the reason for the higher metal concentration generating a greater driving force for metal ions to be fixed on the adsorbent 31 77 the ri values for zn ii cd ii and pb ii ions adsorbed on mmt from cs and d leachates determined by ipd model are presented in the supplementary data table s3 together with their longest adsorption times eq 5 the ri values determined for heavy metals cations show strongly initial adsorption of zn ii intermediately initial adsorption for cd ii and approaching completely initial adsorption for pb ii in cs leachates the ri value determined for pb ii ions adsorbed on mmt from d leachates was lower than 0 1 therefore approaching completely initial adsorption and intermediately initial adsorption of zn ii ri value 0 88 50 the adsorption of zn ii ions adsorbed on the mmt from d leachates was on the basis of ri value intermediately initial adsorption the calculates values of ki and c are shown in table 6 the c values determined from cs leachates decreased as follows zn ii cd ii pb ii which corresponds with initial concentration in cs leachates before sorption moreover with increasing concentration the boundary layer thickness increases and the boundary layer effect is greater 78 3 5 sem the sem images of the mmt following the sorption experiment with metallurgical wastes leachates fig 4 show no visible changes in comparison to the mmt prior to the sorption experiments fig 1 particle morphology and chemical mapping of mmt after the sorption experiments show the presence of zn pb and fe on the mmt surface zn ii and pb ii ions covered the mmt surface independently on the presence of fexoy nps on the mmt surface it can be assumed that the mechanism of sorption onto mmt is a combination of cation exchange and fixation of heavy metal cations on the mmt surface cd is not presented in fig 4 due to its low quantity in comparison with other elements mapping of the mmt surface after sorption experiment proved the presence of fe therefore the sorption experiment did not cause the release of fexoy nps to the ms the magnetic properties of mmt were verified using a magnet after the sorption experiments fig s2 in supplementary data 3 6 regenerability of mmt the hcl solution eliminated more than 80 of zn ii cd ii and pb ii in each desorption step and mmt adsorption properties were higher than 88 following the desorption fig 5 a the increase of the amount of zn ii cd ii and pb ii removed from solution was probably caused by the gradual washing of fexoy nps during the regeneration procedure providing adsorption sites for cations sorption the loss of mass of mmt after regeneration procedure was 53 fig 5 b which was caused by manipulation with composite washing filtration weighing magnetic properties of mmt after the fifth regeneration cycle were verified using a magnet and determined using vibrating sample magnetometer fig 6 shows room temperature magnetisation curves of native montmorillonite mt inset and magnetically modified montmorillonites mmt before and after the fifth regeneration cycle native mt exhibited low magnetisation reversal with nearly zero remanent magnetisation mr followed by almost linear increase of magnetisation with increasing magnetic field towards higher values coercive field hc corresponds to 1 72 ka m and at a magnetic field of 2 t which is not sufficient for the saturation of the sample the magnetisation m 2 reaches the small value about 0 13 am2 kg however magnetic parameters of the magnetically modified powders prior to sorption are significantly higher compared to the native mt see table 7 in particular they reflect the amount and size of magnetic nanoparticles used in the modification the magnetisation m 2 can in this case be considered as saturating after 5th regeneration cycle the decrease in the parameters m 2 and mr is probably related to the decrease in the amount of magnetic nanoparticles in the powder volume a change in their size then indicates an increase in the coercive field 4 conclusion we applied mmt for the elimination of zn ii cd ii and pb ii from metallurgical waste leachates the experimental data obtained from these leachates correspond well with data obtained from model solutions the zn ii cd ii and pb ii removal from cs leachates was more effective than from d leachates nevertheless the qmax values were higher in d leachates therefore the elimination efficiency of zn ii cd ii and pb ii by mmt depends on its initial concentration in solution which we confirmed in experiments with model solutions moreover we successfully tested the regenerability of mmt the elimination of all the metal cations observed was higher than 88 in each step of the five adsorption desorption cycles magnetic properties of mmt after sorption and regenerability experiments were verified using a magnet our results are significant for the understanding of the mmt sorption properties when applied to actual wastewaters since it is crucial to test the sorption properties not only in laboratory conditions finally we prepared and applied regenerable mmt as heavy metals sorbent capable of being easily removed from the solution using a magnetic force declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgement the work was supported by erdf esf new

13700,using magnetic sorbents to pollutants eliminations seem to be an efficient easy to apply and low cost technique however the majority of studies focus on the study of sorption properties using model solutions and research on actual wastewater is largely missing therefore this study aims to assess the application of magnetically modified montmorillonite mmt to eliminate zn ii cd ii and pb ii cations from metallurgical waste leachates first model solutions were prepared to describe the properties of mmt sorption kinetic and isotherm models the determined elimination efficiency was higher than 98 the qmax values were in model solutions determined to be 34 3 2 84 and 7 25 mg g for zn ii cd ii and pb ii respectively then the mmt was applied in order to eliminate of zn ii cd ii and pb ii

uptake capacities obtained by heavy metals adsorption from model solution and metallurgical waste leachates followed the order zn ii pb ii cd ii for dust leachates and zn ii cd ii pb ii for converter sludge leachates which directly corresponds with the heavy metal ions concentration in the leachates moreover the elimination of zn ii cd ii and pb ii by mmt was higher than 98 even in the fifth recycling experiment cycle after the sorption the sorbent was still magnetically active facilitating its removal from the solution mmt proved to be an efficient and regenerable sorbent applicable for wastewater treatment keywords magnetic montmorillonite metallurgical waste leachates sorption heavy metals recycling 1 introduction the production of steel by electric arc furnaces eaf is independent on the production of pig iron and allows the production of different steel grades using scrap metal as a batch in a fully automated operation use of eaf leads to worldwide production of 5 7 million tonnes of dust per year the dust usually collected by bag filters or electrostatic precipitators 1 the chemical composition of the dust depends on the chemical composition of the scrap with the increasing portion of galvanised steel parts being used in the automotive industry the portion of scrap containing zn collected by eaf increases as well therefore the portion of zn could reach up to

to high content of heavy metals pb zn cd and other elements cu s cl f na k rendering their recycling impossible 4 therefore after their stabilisation they are deposited in landfills for hazardous wastes industrial mining and agricultural activities together with vehicle emissions are major sources of the heavy metals in wastewaters 5 6 heavy metals gradually accumulate in the environment they can also be transformed into organometallic compounds which are far more toxic than their precursors 7 after their accumulation in bottom sediments they tend to move up to the food chain 8 zinc cadmium and lead are all heavy metals detrimental to human health for example zinc induces cell death and alteration in brain tissues which contributes to a wide range of diseases mainly alzheimer s and parkinson s disease or lateral sclerosis 9 exposure to cadmium can cause cancer 10 and lead is neurotoxic and leads to multiorgan damages 11 their elimination from wastewaters is of utmost importance the research of new procedures of waste management has been a topical issue for a long time heavy metals can be removed from aqueous solutions by several techniques such as chemical precipitation ion exchange reverse osmosis electrodialysis or sorption 12 13 sorption seems to be more advantageous than conventional techniques mainly due to its relative simplicity low impact on the environment and cost effectiveness surface coatings of the used adsorbent can lead to other beneficial properties of the material such as good thermal stability physical and electrical properties or high saturation magnetisation 14 the key benefit of magnetic modification is that the adsorbent gains ferromagnetic properties and following the sorption it can be together with adsorbed pollutants easily removed from the solution using a magnetic field 15 16 iron oxide fexoy nanoparticles nps have broad application potential in medicine 17 catalysis 18 environmental application 19 or magnetoresponsive nanosystems 20 moreover fexoy nps in lower than 30 40 nm size exhibit superparamagnetic response and reversibly transition between a pseudoparamagnetic state and a pseudoferromagnetic state in the magnetic field 21 the fexoy nps prepared by precipitation usually consist of feo fe2o3 and fe3o4 in magnetically modified composites 22 23 all of these oxides excel in both their superparamagnetic behaviour below 30 nm and biocompatibility following the removal of the magnetic field fexoy nps lose their magnetic properties which prevents the self aggregation of nps their specific surface area is thus not affected and they are therefore suitable for all kinds of biomedical applications and bioseparations 24 26 the fexoy nps have become due to their convenient properties a component in various types of composites especially those applied in wastewater treatment 27 29 for the presented study we chose montmorillonite mt as an experimental sorbent due to its excellent sorption properties for a wide range of pollutants namely heavy metals 30 32 and organic compounds 33 34 relatively large surface area cation exchange capacity low cost and local origin and availability czech republic the elimination of pollutants using mt can take place through ion exchange in the interlayer space where permanent negative charges lead to the formation of outer sphere complexes with metal ions or by the formation of inner sphere complexes on sio and alo groups at the clay particle edges 35 the exact mechanism of these processes depends on many environmental factors such as ph temperature time ionic strength type of sorbent ions or presence of ligands 36 37 various magnetic composites such as geopolymer fe3o4 38 clay fe3o4 and chitosan clay fe3o4 39 montmorillonite magnetic clay nps and organically modified montmorillonite magnetic clay nps 32 or hydroxyapatite magnetite composite 40 were used as efficient adsorbents for removal of cu ii pb ii ni ii cd ii hg ii 38 as iii as v cr vi 39 and co ii 32 from aqueous solutions the magnetic modification is known not to decrease the sorption capacity of the original clays 32 38 39 the elimination of heavy metals cations and pollutants has been an object of many surveys however only a few focused on actual wastewaters are available therefore in this study we used wastewater obtained from either metallurgical sludge or dust for the study of elimination of zn ii cd ii and pb ii ions by mmt we compared the experimental sorption data obtained from metallurgical waste leachates with the data obtained from sorption study in model solutions ms prepared from heavy metals salts excellent sorption properties of a sorbent are not the only attribute required its reusability is a critical factor as well thus we tested the regenerability of mmt for five adsorption desorption cycles 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of magnetic montmorillonite 2 1 1 material as a substrate for fexoy

original mt was determined by bulk chemical analysis this mt is one of the purest natural montmorillonites on the world it does not contain admixtures and thus it does not need to be modified prior to the application the cation exchange capacity of this mt was determined 0 76 meq g in a previous study 41 the specific surface area was measured by sorptomatic 1990 using nitrogen and calculated by the advance data processing software according to the bet isotherm the specific surface area was determined to be 122 m2 g for mt while the value of the cumulative micropore volume was 0 055 m3 g and following the magnetic modification increased to 142 m2 g for mmt while the cumulative micropore volume was 0 063 m3 g 2 1 2 chemicals feso4 7h2o per analyses mach chemikálie s r o ostrava czech

method the suspension containing fexoy nps was prepared by precipitation from the iron hydroxide solution after the elimination of so4 2 ions by decantation evidence reaction using bacl2 the suspension was mixed with deionised water and dried mt finally the mixture was filtered the following day the procedure may be summarised as follows 1 m i c r o w a v e f e x o y n p s m t f i l t r a

concentration of cd ii pb ii or zn ii ions 2 3 2 preparation of sorption solutions the first step of the study of adsorption properties of mmt was the preparation of solutions modelling the concentration of heavy metals in real leachates the initial concentration of observed heavy metals cations was based on concentrations determined in real metallurgical waste leachates previously 43 the model solutions containing a mixture of heavy metals were prepared in 1 5 2040 mg l concentrations range for zn ii cd ii and pb ii in the ms the initial concentrations of heavy metals in ms and initial ph of ms are presented in table 1 this step enables the description of the adsorption properties of cd ii pb ii or zn ii ions on the mmt before testing the sorption of heavy metals from metallurgical waste leachates moreover the determined heavy metals concentrations in prepared solutions show the impact the initial concentrations have on the sorption process a multi metal solution containing 10 mg l of zn ii cd ii and pb ii was prepared to investigate the sorption process on mmt and sorption properties were compared with original mt 2 3 3 preparation of metallurgical wastes leachates converter sludge cs and dust d samples were leached following the european technical standard en 12457 2 44 mixtures with solid to liquid ratio 1 10 were shaken in discontinuous rotation container at a constant speed 4 5 rpm at laboratory temperature for 24 h the leachates were filtered through 0 45 μm filter paper and ph of leachates gryf 158 and concentrations of zn cd pb and fe ions in final extracts were determined using atomic emission spectrometer with inductively coupled plasma aes icp spectro arcos spectro analytical instruments inc germany 2 4 kinetic and adsorption test batch sorption experiments were carried out in plastic flasks at laboratory temperature 0 1 0 01 g of mmt was mixed with 25 ml of ms containing a mixture of cd ii pb ii and zn ii ions table 1 the adsorbent dose and volume of ms were chosen based on our previous experiments 45 the mixtures were shaken at a constant speed 28 rpm for 2 h after the shaking the mixture was filtered through a 0 23 μm pore filter pragopor 8 pragochema spol s r o concentrations of cd ii pb ii and zn ii ions in the filtrate were determined by aes icp the sorption properties of mmt cs and d were tested on 0 1 g of mmt and 25 ml of metallurgical waste leachates in 0 5 48 h interval the monitored elements zn cd pb and fe were determined after filtration in final extracts by aes icp the equilibrium metal uptake capacity was calculated according to eq 2 2 q e v c 0 c e m where qe mg g is the amount of contaminant removed from the solution c0 and ce are the concentrations of the metal ions in the initial solution and at the equilibrium after the sorption experiment mg l respectively v is volume of the solution l and m is the sorbent dose g in the mixture pseudo first 46 pfo eq 3 and pseudo second order 47 pso eq 4 equations were used to explore the kinetics of zn ii cd ii and pb ii ions adsorption on the mmt from cs and d leachates 3 log q e q log q e k 1 t 2 303 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant 1 min and k2 is the adsorption rate constant of the pseudo second order kinetic model g mg min the initial adsorption behaviour can be expressed by weber intraparticle diffusion model written as 5 q t k i t 1 2 c where ki is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant mg g min0 5 and c mg g is the intercept providing information on the thickness of the boundary layer of sorbent 48 49 the so called characteristic curve based on the intra particle diffusion ipd model can be expressed as 50 6 r i q r e f c q r e f 1 c q r e f where ri is defined as the initial adsorption factor of the ipd model and can be represented in terms of the ratio of the initial adsorption amount c to the final adsorption amount qref qref mg g is the solid phase concentration in the longest time of adsorption process 50 sorption of zn ii cd ii and pb ii from model solutions on the mmt was examined by freundlich and lagmuir isotherms in their non linear form 51 52 as well 2 5 regenerability test to evaluate the regenerability of mmt a laboratory prepared multi metal solution containing 10 mg l of zn ii cd ii and pb ii ions was used according to the previously published studies minerals acids provide efficient desorption properties 53 55 hence for the regenerability experiment 0 1 m hcl was selected due to the high metal desorption properties 56 57 0 1 g of mmt was mixed with 25 ml multi metal solution and shaken as is described in the section on adsorption test the concentrations of zn ii cd ii and pb ii were determined using icp aes after the sorption procedure the mmt was mixed with 25 ml 0 1 m hcl and shaken for 2 h the released concentrations of zn ii cd ii and pb ii were determined by aes icp after the desorption experiment the mmt was washed by deionised water until it achieved ph 6 dried at laboratory temperature and weighed then it was used for subsequent adsorption desorption cycle procedure the solid to liquid ratio 0 1 mg of mmt to 25 ml of solution was preserved in all cycles the efficiency of the removal of zn ii cd ii and pb ii was calculated as follows 57 7 re amount of metal desorbed in one cycle amount of metal loaded in one cycle x 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological and edx analysis of mmt comparison of the detailed stem images of the native mt fig 1a and mmt fig 1b reveals a difference in surface details the surface of mmt consisted of more rounded clusters particles than the surface of the native mt the detailed image shows that fexoy nps of irregular shape and different size are found on the mmt surface characterisation of mt and mmt using xrpd vibrating sample magnetometer scanning electron microscope and edax was published in more details in our previous article 45 3 2 elimination of heavy metals from the multi element solution fig 2 shows the effect of the zn ii pb ii and cd ii combination and the influence of the initial concentrations of these metals in ms on their elimination by mmt initial ph of ms was determined to be in 5 06 5 33 range which is favourable for zn ii cd ii and pb ii adsorption 58 59 removal of zn ii by mmt from ms1 ms10 was unaffected by the presence of cd ii and pb ii ions and their initial concentrations the percentage of zn ii removed by mmt achieved almost 100 in the whole concentration range 1 2000 mg l the efficiency of pb ii and cd ii elimination was influenced by the increased concentration of heavy metals in the initial solutions especially of zn ii the elimination of pb ii by mmt from ms was still efficient when the concentration of zn ii was lower than 250 mg l in the initial solution ms6 when the concentration exceeded 20 mg l of zn ii and 10 mg l of pb ii in the initial solution ms4 the elimination of cd ii decreased this decrease is caused by the fixed number of active sites of the mmt adsorbent as well as high concentrations of adsorbed elements that lead to saturation of the active sites 60 for the explanation of the mmt facilitated heavy metals elimination model solutions with various combination of initial heavy metals concentration were prepared the initial concentrations of the metals in the prepared ms11 14 are presented in table 1 the equilibrium metal uptake capacity removal efficiency and their comparison with ms9 and ms10 are presented in the table 2 final ph of ms after sorption experiments decreased to 4 09 4 95 see fig s1 in supplementary data the generation of protons probably caused this during the adsorption process reversing the ph towards the acidic levels 35 it had been assumed that oh ions could compete for zn ii with the active sites on the adsorbent surface at higher ph values 13 61 however in the case of ms11 ms14 where the initial ph values of ms were the same as the initial ph of ms1 ms10 only 13 5 of zn ii were removed by mmt therefore we did not confirm this assumption the elimination of zn ii from ms11 ms14 was affected by the higher initial concentration of cd ii and pb ii ions the ionic radius of study heavy metals cations decrease as follows pb ii 0 119 nm cd ii 0 097 nm zn ii 0 074 nm 62 therefore based on their ionic radius the higher affinity to mmt should be pb ii than cd ii and zn ii this precondition was verified on the mmt in our previous study 45 based on this study and aforementioned experiments the efficiency of mmt facilitated removal of zn ii cd ii and pb ii from ms depended on the initial concentrations of these metals in the ms this effect is caused by the concentration gradient of heavy metals cations present in the mixtures to demonstrate the mechanism of heavy metals sorption onto mmt we applied original mt and mmt to eliminate heavy metals from a multi component solution containing 10 mg l of zn ii cd ii and pb ii the equilibrium metal uptake capacity and removal of zn ii cd ii and pb ii from multi component solution was the same for mt and mmt table s1 in supplementary data the following adsorption trend was observed pb ii zn ii cd ii which corresponds with both our previous results 45 and the results reported by 63 where the sorption trend from the two component solution was zn ii cd ii it can be assumed that cation exchange mechanism took part in the sorption process therefore the concentrations of na k mg and ca released during the sorption experiment from mt and mmt were determined table s2 in supplementary data the concentrations of na k mg and ca released during the sorption by mt were slightly higher than those when mmt was applied the cations were released from mmt during the preparation therefore the determined concentrations were lower than those from mt after sorption experiment it can be concluded that zn ii cd ii and pb ii sorption onto mt and mmt follows the same mechanism and that there was no effect of fexoy nps presence on the sorption process based on the structure of mt surface we can propose that the adsorption of zn ii cd ii and pb ii on the mt and mmt take place partly by cation exchange mechanism table s2 and by the formation of complexes on sio and alo groups at the clay particle edges adsorption sites on the clay surface and edges are deprotonated when alkalinity increases and are ready to adsorb heavy metals cations 35 adsorption may be described by equation eq 8 where protons are generated and would reverse ph towards the acidic side 35 8 s oh m2 h2o s o moh2 2h moreover fe o could act as a lewis base and can coordinate with zn ii cd ii pb ii to form inner sphere complexes 64 partial protonation of feo to feoh at ph 5 could also lead to both inner and outer sphere complexations with metal cations 64 these presumptions correspond with the decrease of ph values following sorption experiment using ms1 ms14 fig s1 in supplementary data the sorption of zn ii pb ii and cd ii ions on mmt from the solution modelling real concentration of metallurgical waste leachates is presented in fig 2 d f the experimental data were fitted by freundlich and langmuir isotherm models in the non linear form the maximum sorption capacity of mmt was determined to be 34 32 mg g 2 84 mg g and 7 25 mg g for zn ii cd ii and pb ii ions respectively table 3 experimental data correlated well with both the langmuir and freundlich equations however the freundlich adsorption model fit for the cd ii adsorption better r2 0 99 than the langmuir adsorption model r2 0 94 on the other hand the adsorption of both zn ii and cd ii ions on the mmt was described better by langmuir isotherm the 1 n value was lower than 1 indicating that the adsorption of zn ii cd ii and pb ii on the mmt is favourable 65 the separation factor rl 0 rl 1 determined that the adsorption process of zn ii pb ii and cd ii ions from model solution on the mmt was favourable as well 66 the concentrations of fe released to the final extracts after sorption experiments were determined as well using aes icp the concentrations of fe released to the solutions after sorption experiments were lower than 0 14 mg l which corresponds to 0 04 mg g the magnetic properties of mmt after sorption experiments were verified by a magnet fig s2 in supplementary data 3 3 characterisation of metallurgical waste leachates metallurgical waste leachates were obtained per european technical standard en 12457 2 44 preparation of leachates was described in more details in the preceding section 2 2 the concentrations of zn ii pb ii and cd ii in the leachates obtained from converter sludge cs determined by aes icp were 10 4 mg l 7 04 mg l and 0 57 mg l for zn ii cd ii and pb ii and final ph of leachate was determined to be 6 89 in the leachates obtained from dust d the determined concentrations were 1200 mg l 22 mg l and 3 91 mg l for zn ii cd ii and pb ii respectively while the final ph was 6 16 3 3 1 effect of the phase contact time the values of adsorbed percentage re of pb ii exceeded 98 cs leachates and 70 d leachates the constant value of equilibrium metal uptake capacity of cd ii ions removed by mmt from both leachates was achieved within 2 h fig 3 a b the maximum adsorption capacity of pb ii 92 5 was achieved after 2 h as reported by 67 as well the zn ii ions amount adsorbed on mmt form cs leachates increased with increasing contact time for the cs leachates the percentage of heavy metals adsorbed on mmt was higher for than for the d leachates which was probably caused by the filling of the mmt adsorption sites by heavy metals present in d leachates comparison of mmt adsorbed pollutants from metallurgical waste leachates and from the prepared model solutions is shown in table 4 the qmax and re values were higher for the heavy metals cations sorption from ms than for their sorption from metallurgical waste leachates the higher values were caused by the presence of other elements in cs and d leachates on the other hand the elimination of heavy metals cations from metallurgical waste leachates especially cs by mmt was efficient the qmax values of similar types of adsorbents are presented in table 5 the lower values qmax of cd ii and pb ii determined in present work in comparison with results of other authors were influenced by its sorption from multi metal solution the maximum adsorption capacity of similar adsorbents was determined due to sorption from single metal solution moreover the qmax value is influenced by the initial concentrations of the pollutants as present tables 2 and 5 3 4 kinetic parameters the k2 and qe parameters of the pso kinetic model were calculated based on eq 3 and are presented in table 6 the coefficients of determination r2 obtained for the pso kinetic model were greater than 0 97 for all metal ions adsorbed on mmt from cs leachates and greater than 0 98 for metal ions besides cd ii from d leachates fig 3 c d the pso kinetic model is a convenient expression for the representation of the sorption of heavy metals from cs leachates and zn ii and pb ii ions from d leachates on the mmt although pb ii ion radius is greater than the radius of cd ii and zn ii ions the molar conductivity values 1 2 pb2 71 10 4 m2 s mol predict pb ii as the fastest adsorbed ion from metallurgical waste leachates on the mmt 62 this prediction was confirmed by the constant value of the pso rate determined in cs leachates as well however in the case of d leachates the highest pso rate constant was determined for zn ii 1 2 zn2 52 8 10 4 m2 s mol 62 the higher k2 value of zn ii was caused mainly by its concentration gradient in comparison with cd ii and pb ii this was confirmed in the aforementioned experiments with model solutions the pfo kinetic model did not fit the experimental data as well as the pso kinetic model the pfo kinetic model coefficients of determination had lower values than the pso kinetic model and therefore it is not presented the plots of the intraparticle diffusion model ipd fig 3 e f were not linear over the whole time the plot did not pass through the origin hence the adsorption was influenced to some degree by the boundary layer 76 there were either one or three parts of the curve controlling the rate of molecule adsorption but only one of them was limiting step the first slope of the linear part indicated the adsorption rate the second part is probably the diffusion into mesopores and the third part refers to the adsorption into micropores the limiting step of zn ii and cd ii ions adsorption from the cs leachate was probably the adsorption into mmt pores the portion of the plots of pb ii ions adsorption from both leachates was nearly parallel did not pass through the origin the pb ii elimination by mmt was higher than 97 from cs leachates and higher than 70 from d leachates and ri value was lower than 0 1 hence it can be concluded that the process was mainly controlled by strongly initial adsorption these differences are caused by the size of the molecules and the varying initial concentrations 50 the following trend of adsorption amount was observed zn ii cd ii pb ii for cs leachates and zn ii pb ii cd ii for d leachates adsorption was directly related to the initial heavy metal concentration in cs and d leachates this trend corresponds with the results obtained by sorption of heavy metals from ms1 14 the same adsorption trend was observed during the sorption of heavy metals from automobile effluent on the mt 31 this effect is the reason for the higher metal concentration generating a greater driving force for metal ions to be fixed on the adsorbent 31 77 the ri values for zn ii cd ii and pb ii ions adsorbed on mmt from cs and d leachates determined by ipd model are presented in the supplementary data table s3 together with their longest adsorption times eq 5 the ri values determined for heavy metals cations show strongly initial adsorption of zn ii intermediately initial adsorption for cd ii and approaching completely initial adsorption for pb ii in cs leachates the ri value determined for pb ii ions adsorbed on mmt from d leachates was lower than 0 1 therefore approaching completely initial adsorption and intermediately initial adsorption of zn ii ri value 0 88 50 the adsorption of zn ii ions adsorbed on the mmt from d leachates was on the basis of ri value intermediately initial adsorption the calculates values of ki and c are shown in table 6 the c values determined from cs leachates decreased as follows zn ii cd ii pb ii which corresponds with initial concentration in cs leachates before sorption moreover with increasing concentration the boundary layer thickness increases and the boundary layer effect is greater 78 3 5 sem the sem images of the mmt following the sorption experiment with metallurgical wastes leachates fig 4 show no visible changes in comparison to the mmt prior to the sorption experiments fig 1 particle morphology and chemical mapping of mmt after the sorption experiments show the presence of zn pb and fe on the mmt surface zn ii and pb ii ions covered the mmt surface independently on the presence of fexoy nps on the mmt surface it can be assumed that the mechanism of sorption onto mmt is a combination of cation exchange and fixation of heavy metal cations on the mmt surface cd is not presented in fig 4 due to its low quantity in comparison with other elements mapping of the mmt surface after sorption experiment proved the presence of fe therefore the sorption experiment did not cause the release of fexoy nps to the ms the magnetic properties of mmt were verified using a magnet after the sorption experiments fig s2 in supplementary data 3 6 regenerability of mmt the hcl solution eliminated more than 80 of zn ii cd ii and pb ii in each desorption step and mmt adsorption properties were higher than 88 following the desorption fig 5 a the increase of the amount of zn ii cd ii and pb ii removed from solution was probably caused by the gradual washing of fexoy nps during the regeneration procedure providing adsorption sites for cations sorption the loss of mass of mmt after regeneration procedure was 53 fig 5 b which was caused by manipulation with composite washing filtration weighing magnetic properties of mmt after the fifth regeneration cycle were verified using a magnet and determined using vibrating sample magnetometer fig 6 shows room temperature magnetisation curves of native montmorillonite mt inset and magnetically modified montmorillonites mmt before and after the fifth regeneration cycle native mt exhibited low magnetisation reversal with nearly zero remanent magnetisation mr followed by almost linear increase of magnetisation with increasing magnetic field towards higher values coercive field hc corresponds to 1 72 ka m and at a magnetic field of 2 t which is not sufficient for the saturation of the sample the magnetisation m 2 reaches the small value about 0 13 am2 kg however magnetic parameters of the magnetically modified powders prior to sorption are significantly higher compared to the native mt see table 7 in particular they reflect the amount and size of magnetic nanoparticles used in the modification the magnetisation m 2 can in this case be considered as saturating after 5th regeneration cycle the decrease in the parameters m 2 and mr is probably related to the decrease in the amount of magnetic nanoparticles in the powder volume a change in their size then indicates an increase in the coercive field 4 conclusion we applied mmt for the elimination of zn ii cd ii and pb ii from metallurgical waste leachates the experimental data obtained from these leachates correspond well with data obtained from model solutions the zn ii cd ii and pb ii removal from cs leachates was more effective than from d leachates nevertheless the qmax values were higher in d leachates therefore the elimination efficiency of zn ii cd ii and pb ii by mmt depends on its initial concentration in solution which we confirmed in experiments with model solutions moreover we successfully tested the regenerability of mmt the elimination of all the metal cations observed was higher than 88 in each step of the five adsorption desorption cycles magnetic properties of mmt after sorption and regenerability experiments were verified using a magnet our results are significant for the understanding of the mmt sorption properties when applied to actual wastewaters since it is crucial to test the sorption properties not only in laboratory conditions finally we prepared and applied regenerable mmt as heavy metals sorbent capable of being easily removed from the solution using a magnetic force declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgement the work was supported by erdf esf new

13701,the new world order requires solutions integrating a sustainability oriented approach to mitigate problems associated with population increase and overexploitation of renewable and non renewable resources in this regard circular economy encourages the use of technologies that make it possible to reuse or take advantage of different types of waste thus bioprocesses and technologies focused on the recovery of value added products from wastewater can contribute to this end the present study sought to identify the scientific and technological trajectory of this area of knowledge using bibliometric analysis network analysis and patent application analysis as a first approach to understand this problem some of the most relevant results are the identification of actors and dynamics around the progress of scientific and technological production in the generation of solutions aimed at contributing to sustainable development with a particular emphasis on the need to generate technically and economically viable proposals based on adecuate policies and robust regulatory frameworks that allow for the adequate development of this activity keywords technological trajectory wastewater product recovery basic research technological development 1 introduction 1 1 sustainability and the circular economy in any economy sustainability and its associated problems require a multidisciplinary approach for adequate management 1 many of the problems posed by wastewater production can be solved by implementing resource recovery systems and through them implement actions aimed at improving sustainability 2 therefore the efficient management of these wastes and the optimization of water use must be incentivized 3 additionally any evaluation of wastewater resource recovery systems should consider not only the evaluation method but also the contexts and opinions of all stakeholders 4 this concern has been addressed by the european union eu where the criteria behind sustainable policies and the use of resources were based on guidelines provided the circular economy seeking tangible economic social and environmental benefits 5 therefore different countries have embraced circular economy because it offers an environmentally friendly alternative to the current production model 6 circular economy represents an interesting framework to integrate relevant elements such as reuse recycling and reduction although it is crucial to continue constructing the concept and increasing its accuracy and promoting its association with the notion of sustainable development 7 8 therefore circular economy can be seen as an alternative to optimize the use of resources and simultaneously decrease waste 9 it is considered to have a positive relationship with sustainability and it represents a good starting point for sustainable production 10 the expected results of circular economy and its methods will vary depending on the approach leaning either toward waste mitigation and saving resources or toward economic development 11 1 2 bioprocesses and technologies for the recovery of value added wastewater products the current approach to wastewater treatment has incorporated the recovery of value added products 12 increasing its relevance and potential for instance wastewater from fruit and vegetable processing industries contain large amounts of bioactive compounds that can be recovered not only to mitigate environmental impact but also to promote the development of other value added products 13 similarly wastewater resulting from the nixtamalization process alkaline treatment of maize allows for the recovery of gelling arabinoxylan prebiotic which is useful as a probiotic vehicle for example bifidobacterium 14 in the case of wastewater from shrimp cooking the recovery of astaxanthin and bioactive peptides can be used in important applications 15 additionally antioxidants such as melanoidins and polyphenols with potential applications in pharmacy cosmetics and food production can be obtained from wastewater generated during the distillation process of sugarcane molasses 16 concerning energy the bio electrochemical system bes provides an attractive mechanism to recover bioelectricity from wastewater as well as other components such as methane industrial chemicals hydrogen and heavy metals among others 17 similarly microbial electrosynthesis systems mess have shown their potential to provide solutions not only in terms of resource recovery but also to obtain energy sustainably through wastewater treatment 18 on the other hand microbial electrometallurgical processes are useful for the recovery of metals sn fe and cu and organic products for example acetates and polymers from wastewater produced by the manufacture of printed circuit boards prcb which contributes to compliance with disposal requirements for this type of effluent 19 electrodialysis anti fouling configurations used to treat tannery wastewater represent an option for the recovery of proteins amino acids and low molecular weight charged species while at the same time water is desalinated and treated for reuse 20 similarly the recovery of gold ions contained in gold plating wastewater can be achieved by using low cost activated carbon from agricultural waste via the absorption process 21 biorefineries can be used to transform waste from the dairy industry into useful products ranging from biofuels and bioplastics to food additives and different chemicals 22 another potentially attractive case for a biorefinery is the use of microalgae to produce biomass and energy from urban wastewater and as the primary treatment of such type of effluent 23 in fact due to their versatility microalgae have many applications in sustainable biorefineries that help to meet two critical objectives product recovery and biofuel recovery 24 a series of interesting biorefinement processes using industrial wastewater have to do with biohydrogen production 25 the biorefinery is also being used to produce cellulases and decrease pollutants in domestic wastewater 26 microbiological methods e g microremediation are being used to decrease contaminant load in wastewater from refineries for example phenols and at the same time to produce useful enzymes 27 actors in the food industry have developed applications to recover products of interest for example olive oil mills where a spray drying system can recover the product and decrease contaminant loads 28 in this type of mills phenolic compounds can also be recovered and eliminated using physical extraction and chemical and biological methods reduction of organic load 29 another example is the production of potato chips in which separation methods can mitigate the organic load of wastewater decrease water consumption and help to recover by products such as starch oil and fat which have different uses for instance in paper and soap manufacturing processes 30 the textile industry uses ultrafiltration processes to recover and reuse polyvinyl alcohol pva with the purpose of mitigating environmental impact 31 photosynthetic bacteria psb are an exciting group of microorganisms that have different functions they are used in wastewater treatment processes they produce proteins carotenoids and coenzyme q10 among others and they help to eliminate residual sludge 32 33 anaerobic processes to recover energy in the form of methane are used in the treatment of low resistance domestic wastewater 34 methanotrophs represent an option to reduce methane production during wastewater treatment methanol and biopolymers can be synergistically obtained in the process and these microorganisms also participate in biological nitrogen mitigation 35 in wastewater from egg processing plants electrocoagulation provides an alternative for the efficient recovery of protein and fat 36 for its part municipal wastewater treatment can be approached by using microalgae to obtain proteins and carbohydrates originating from the produced biomass 37 the recovery of phosphorus from sludge from urban effluents for fertilizer production is unviable due to the scarce presence of this element and the high costs associated with its production reactants and energy 38 despite the potential of phosphorus recovery from municipal waters it is important to note the technical and environmental challenges associated with replacing phosphorus contained in phosphate rocks for agricultural use 39 hydroxyapatite precipitation is one method to obtain phosphorus from acid wastewater 40 crystallization processes are viable in high phosphorus content wastewater 41 as well as in urban and livestock wastewater via struvite crystallization technologies 42 the reduction of total ammonia nitrogen tan and the recovery of total orthophosphate in wastewater from swine production is a focal point in the industry in this regard a proposed technology uses bittern as a less expensive alternative magnesium source that yields positive results in terms of performance and profitability 43 1 3 environmental policy and regulation challenges and opportunities legislative aspects socioeconomic impact safety and hygiene issues and the evaluation of heavy metal and organic micropollutant contents associated with products recovered from wastewater for example from domestic wastewater must be addressed by research as a sine qua non condition toward effective solutions 44 the following are regulatory obstacles and milestones around the world in the eu carrying out recycling and phosphorus recovery activities using wastewater requires complying with regulations established by the market and environmental and health laws 45 value added products generated from sewage sludge must be carefully evaluated for endocrine disrupting compound edc content and the presence of toxic intermediaries and to avoid further restrictions to their use storage and commercialization 46 in the eu sewage sludge storage criteria are being replaced by initiatives aimed at stabilization and safe recycling in favor of the environment and enhancing product recovery therefore it is relevant to evaluate the safety of each application for an adequate classification 47 at the legislative level several economies are prioritizing research on two key elements alternative fuels and sustainable biorefineries using waste products favoring a model centered on circular economy 48 in china industrial wastewater is marginally controlled which aggravates the environmental impact of the country s increasing economic activity 49 in response to its large demand for water resources however the country has advanced a wastewater reuse strategy but the lack of public awareness cooperation from other actors and the unhurried adoption of wastewater related programs have been obstacles to its implementation the guidelines and integral management of these resources need to be further developed in addition to technical requirements for water quality and aspects related to commercialization must be defined 50 in developing countries the irrigation of crops using treated water also requires the development of policies incorporating financial mechanisms and institutional work to address this problem 51 in general developing economies frequently fail to provide comprehensive information to formulate adequate policies to address problems associated with the recovery of resources from this type of effluent 52 although wastewater reuse is certainly promoted these countries often lack regulatory frameworks dealing with environmental protection and health 53 consequently addressing these problems should be a priority in developing countries as well as the incorporation of endogenous technologies providing effective and efficient solutions although developing countries must also be capable of creating their own technological solutions and compete at the global scale on the other hand knowledge about wastewater treatment and sanitation technologies will allow for a better understanding of how to comply with existing regulations and norms which will result in efficient solutions for water disposal or reuse 54 therefore progress in political normative technical and environmental matters is a relevant area of focus in this field wastewater treatment indicators reveal the degree of sustainability associated with a technology 55 56 and the use of these indicators is also necessary for activities involving the recovery of value added products it is also essential to outline the scientific and technological trajectory of this field of knowledge to identify its current status and provide information for the design of strategies to develop original basic and applied research projects aimed at advancing technological solutions that have a positive impact at the economic social and environmental levels therefore the main goal of the present study was to provide a first approach to the scientific and technological trajectory around the recovery of value added products from wastewater 2 method the nature of technological progress is evolutionary shaped by multiple dynamics and uncertainty during its development 57 the technological innovation of products and processes is increasingly complex and innovation is a key factor for industrialization and economic growth 58 59 thus the definition of a technological trajectory technological development is quite useful to outline the state of a technology over a period of time although identifying such trajectory is of course not easy and how closely it is defined depends on the desired degree of detail specificity 60 61 the scientific trajectories basic research must also be considered in this context because science and technology often present coevolutionary dynamics 62 in this regard innovation studies can be operationalized in different ways for instance bibliometric and network analyses have proven useful in approaching and understanding regional innovation systems as a contribution to the correct design of innovation policies 63 thus different methods and tools can be used to support the identification and development of a scientific and technological trajectory in different areas of knowledge these can be considered as a starting point for the present study 1 patent analysis to identify sources of knowledge and innovation capabilities 64 2 bibliometric and co occurrence analyses keywords to map scientific knowledge 65 66 and 3 analysis of networks to understand collaboration in science and technology co authorship 67 each of these in addition to other tools provides different alternatives depending on the scope of each project and the need to delve into a specific area of knowledge the present study sought to identify the scientific and technological trajectory around the recovery of value added products from wastewater for this purpose the study procedure was divided into the following stages 1 bibliometric analysis statistical analysis of indicators 2 networking keyword author co occurrence analysis and 3 analysis of patent applications statistical analysis of indicators each of these stages involved the search for information documents and patent applications related to the terms recovery products and wastewater in two databases scopus 68 and patentscope world intellectual property organization wipo which accounts for millions of patent documents 69 they represent two robust and reliable documentary sources to search for data on science and technology in the case of scopus the search criteria were focused on documents including the aforementioned terms within the title abstract and keywords 2 828 documents title abs key recovery and title abs key products and title abs key wastewater and pubyear 1971 and pubyear 2021 this search allowed not only to analyze the production of documents using the terms over time but also to visualize such production by country knowledge area institutions and publication sources and to generate a first approach to the scientific progress of this area of study based on the same search criteria 1 708 results were obtained for the period from 2011 to 2020 title abs key recovery and title abs key products and title abs key wastewater and pubyear 2010 and pubyear 2021 these data were used in a network study based on keyword co occurrence analysis which complemented the analysis of the scientific trajectory by identifying the most relevant thematic clusters i e grouping related terms and nodes elements within the scientific production associated with the recovery of products using wastewater treatment processes subsequently to outline the progress of this industrial sector the technological trajectory was identified by searching for patent applications in the patentscope database using the same three terms used in the scopus search and the following filter options 1 advanced search 2 english 3 all offices and 4 including automatic word separation in lexemes items groups were analyzed according to the maximum of 50 results provided by the patentscope analysis bar recovery and products and wastewater as a result 20 852 patent applications were identified for the period from 1972 to 2020 revealing the countries that receive most of these applications their applicants as well as the most important technological sectors being developed in the light of this area of knowledge this methodological development made it possible to verify the vertiginous progress of basic research in the field under study and its related technologies concerning scientific production only two documents were published in 1974 but in 2019 293 were published and in the case of patent applications only one application was submitted in 1972 but a total of 1 458 were submitted in 2019 the year with most patent applications to date see fig 1 2 1 scientific trajectory 2 1 1 statistical analysis basic research ten leading economies associated with wastewater product recovery has been conducted in north america 619 documents from the united states and canada europe 630 documents from spain italy united kingdom germany and france asia 653 documents from china and india and australia 111 documents most countries in this group are classified as developed the united states and china are clearly the leaders with 509 and 495 publications respectively however other developing economies such as brazil barely made it into the 13th place with 54 publications in the study period which highlights the need to allocate more resources and establish policies to foster scientific development on problems that could be addressed by using these results under a sustainable approach in developing countries when the analysis was focused on scientific production by institution the predominance of chinese institutions in the top ten became clear these institutions are 1 chinese academy of sciences first place 2 ministry of education china third place 3 tsinghua university fourth place 4 university of the chinese academy of sciences fifth place 5 harbin institute of technology sixth place and 6 tongji university seventh place the university of queensland australia ranked second and the eighth ninth and tenth positions are occupied by ghent university belgium the wageningen university and research center netherlands and the delft university of technology netherlands respectively noticeably the united states has the highest number of publications globally but none of its institutions rank in the top ten it is also important to indicate that these ten institutions are in general highly productive table 1 shows the total number of documents registered in the scopus database for each of them as well as for their three main publication areas as can be observed in many cases the recovery of added value from wastewater could be considered a priority research area for these organizations and thus expand their participation in this type of research an analysis of the scientific production by area of knowledge shows that most of this production is related to the area of environmental science the rest is focused on strictly technical areas such as engineering chemistry chemical engineering biochemistry genetics and molecular biology energy and materials science among others the business administration and accounting area is ranked in the tenth place with a total of only 85 publications which highlights the need to increase the participation of this field but also of other disciplines within the social and economic sciences in order to develop our understanding of these issues not only from an environmental and technical perspective but also from one that integrates sustainable goals by including economic and social elements into the equation in other words it is necessary for other knowledge areas to become more involved in the study and discussion on the recovery of value added products from wastewater this increased interest would result among other things in robust legislative and regulatory frameworks increased understanding of specific needs in each context and holistic solutions see fig 2 the type of documents included in this search are as follows a article 2078 b conference paper 412 c review 199 d book chapter 79 e conference review 24 f book 13 g note 13 h report 3 i short survey 3 j erratum 2 k business article 1 and l editorial 1 among the main sources where these studies are being published are academic journals indexed in the journal citation reports jcr 71 given the significant impact factor of these

a priority for the scientific community and it is taking on a prominent position in the most important journals in the world especially in publications focused on eco friendly solutions 2 1 2 network study the co occurrence exercise was carried out using the same search criteria in scopus but for the period from 2011 to 2020 in this case the analysis criteria were as follows 1 type of analysis co occurrence 2 unit of analysis author keywords and 3 counting method full counting as a result 4 331 keywords were identified of which 202 have a minimum number of five keyword occurrences in other words each of these terms appears at least five times frequency a total of 11 clusters were formed which were composed of 202 nodes and 1 508 links total link strength was 2 351 thus the five nodes with the highest number of occurrences for each cluster are the following 1 red cluster wastewater 182 pharmaceuticals 60 sludge 27 solid phase extraction 23 and ic ms ms 20 2 dark green cluster wastewater treatment 107 reverse osmosis 22 water reuse 21 nanofiltration 20 and desalination 16 3 dark blue cluster phosphorus recovery 82 struvite 81 adsorption 50 recovery 45 and calcium phosphate

orange cluster nutrient recovery 43 phosphorus 30 and recycling 15 8 light pink brown cluster olive mill wastewater 21 sustainability 15 and phenolic compounds 13 9 dark pink cluster sewage sludge 37 biomass 16 and pyrolysis 12 10 light pink cluster life cycle assessment 20 precipitation 13 and phosphorous recovery 7 and 11 light green cluster coagulation 8 antibiotic 5 and chitosan 5 as a result of this analysis we could identify different thematic groups related to fields of knowledge such as wastewater treatment or phosphorus energy and nutrient recovery among others it was also possible to pinpoint the main bioprocesses and technologies in use and to outline areas of higher development and those with less development which represent areas of opportunity for basic science projects see fig 4 observing the arrangement and relationships among each thematic cluster reveals the interaction among the different concepts involved in the basic research on the multiple problems faced by the field as efficient solutions for the recovery of wastewater resources are developed one of the most important nodes concerns phosphorus recovery this element is intensively used in agriculture and another important element is the production of energy for industrial applications to reduce environmental impact although other widely used methods e g anaerobic digestion are also represented the figure shows the presence of less widespread techniques e g nanofiltration and evaporation among others that will likely continue growing over time as their knowledge base is developed within the framework of this field as clearly shown by the figure the recovery of value added products and wastewater treatment are frequently symbiotic 2 2 technological trajectory 2 2 1 statistical analysis a patent application analysis showed that most were submitted in the united states 9 350 in total reflecting the importance of this country as a target market for the use and application of these technologies and most of the 20 852 global results for the period from 1972 to 2020 are from six actors the united states the pct the patent cooperation treaty canada european patent office epo australia and china 20 252 documents the rest were submitted in the united kingdom israel new zealand and south africa 504 documents as well as in ten other countries not in the top ten 96 documents this result shows that the use of applications derived from technologies associated with the use of wastewater processes for product recovery is limited to a few actors and therefore other economies could also take advantage of their benefits the most outstanding american applicants are xyleco a chemical products manufacturer 72 general electric company a diversified technology and financial services company 73 strong force iot portfolio 2016 patent portfolio holding company 74 calera corporation specializing in carbon sequestration 75 e i dupont de nemours and company a producer of agricultural products and specialized products 76 and chevron usa energy services 77 in europe the leaders are shell oil company netherlands and england specialized in energy and petrochemicals 78 and basf se germany a chemical company 79 in asia toray industries japan a fiber products manufacturer 80 and the saudi arabian oil company saudi arabia involved in the entire chain of hydrocarbon exploration production commercialization and refining 81 see fig 5 however there are numerous other applicants the following is a list of examples of patent documents concerning the recovery of fluorosilicate phosphate potassium ammonium and heavy metals from wastewater 1 us20140231359 treatment of phosphate containing wastewater with fluorosilicate and phosphate recovery applicant ostara nutrient recovery technologies inc 2 us20150274562 wastewater refinery applicants grains research development corporation and the university of queensland 3 us20190002321 recovery of phosphorus compounds from wastewater applicant kemira oyj 4 ca2799294 treatment of phosphate containing wastewater applicant ostara nutrient recovery technologies inc y 5 us20180050931 process for separate removal and recovery of heavy metals from industrial wastewater applicant nanchang hangkong university 69 as can be appreciated this technological field is dominated by transnational companies which is why the broader intervention of other actors such as academia or the incursion of companies from developing economies would be desirable for these markets concerning the development of the technological areas with which the patent applications are associated according to the international patent classification ipc classes c02 f and b01d are noteworthy these classes are focused on processes designed to neutralize or attenuate harmful chemicals sediment separation treat wastewater for different purposes infrastructure and separate solids from liquids and solids from solids using a variety of techniques the rest of the categories including more than 1 000 documents are grouped into applications related to catalysis colloidal chemistry fermentation and enzymatic processes to synthesize compounds topics associated with the use of enzymes and microorganisms obtention of organic compounds by techniques such as electrolysis and the use of enzymes in the preparation of inorganic compounds among others finally the number of applications associated with processes such as cracking or pyrolysis measurement and testing of enzymatic or microbiological processes water reclamation and soluble materials among others is less than 1000 see table 2 this analysis reveals the many physical chemical or biological methods that can be used to obtain different products and enable various processes among these physical and chemical processes as well as microbiology have played a central role in applications aimed at recovering resources from wastewater 3 discussion and conclusions the development and use of technologies and bioprocesses related to the treatment and recovery of value added products in wastewater is a relevant issue that needs to be further developed by promoting scientific research and technological development to achieve effective and efficient solutions to pressing issues thus the wide range of wastewater compositions represents a potential that can be channeled via two types of applications wastewater treatment and recovery of high value added products such as energy proteins amino acids metals and organic products among many others therefore the use of these technologies becomes a priority for addressing environmental problems and mitigating industrial impact and also for integrating economic and social elements to support their sustainable development the scientific trajectory outlined in the present study shows that most of the knowledge in the area is concentrated in developed countries where well identified areas of interest and opportunity are becoming increasingly relevant therefore developing economies should increase their participation although the activity has significantly increased in recent years the reported number of documents is still short from what could be considered significant production therefore the promotion of basic research will require increased support and will be an important basis to understand horizontal and cross sectional issues on wastewater product recovery in this regard the leadership of institutions in china australia and europe is noteworthy and the participation of organizations from developing countries should take on a more significant role in the face of the sustainability problems that they are bound to face in the future undoubtedly basic research in this field represents a topic of interest for highly specialized journals this kind of research should undoubtedly include an environmental and technical scope but also an economic and social perspective data on the technological trajectory shows that applications in the field present a more vital dynamic than scientific production and the increase has been more pronounced since the year 2010 when more than 1 000 patent applications were submitted however most of these applications are filed through the united states the pct canada the european patent office australia and china which reflects the applicants interest in these territories and as in the case of the united states that it represents not only a critical consumer market but also the key technological market therefore in view of the predominance of companies from developed countries the creation of markets and the integration of proprietary technologies in developing countries is not a trivial task similarly certain technological areas have a higher concentration of technological developments associated with the treatment and recovery of wastewater products such as sludge treatment separation chemical or physical processes among others however other technological areas that have a central role in the advancement of this technological field are also growing such as material analysis and obtention of organic compounds among others despite significant progress in wastewater treatment and the recovery of value added products there are evident limitations that need to be addressed under a scientific and technological approach so that additional technically and economically feasible solutions can be developed in addition efforts directed at the economic and social development that must derive from the use of these technologies must be undertaken by the scientific community and all stakeholders in other words to achieve sustainable development all involved actors from the academia the industrial sector and the government must promote ad hoc policies to advance research and development create legislative normative and regulatory frameworks train highly specialized human resources address ethical biosecurity and intellectual property protection issues and invest in infrastructure and market development especially in developing economies where endogenous knowledge and technology must also be promoted while their natural resources and the social welfare of their most vulnerable populations are also protected the present study was intended as a first approach to the progress of this area of knowledge and its main related themes the present study adopted a general approach to the subject matter which can be considered as a limitation therefore future lines of research focused on the recovery of resources from wastewater must address specific cases and on that basis evaluate their specific benefits and problems it is also important to develop strategies toward an agenda focused on the most relevant problems in each country in particular the emphasis should be placed on developing countries facing adverse situations this scientific and technological trajectory is a starting point into this field and the purpose of the present study was to outline the general state of the scientific and technological development associated with the recovery of value added products from wastewater a more in depth view into the area will depend on the desired specificity finally actions aimed at promoting sustainable solutions must be put in place in this regard the circular economy can provide an interesting framework for such actions integrating the technical economic social and environmental aspects declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments we wish to acknowledge the support provided by the national polytechnic institute instituto politécnico nacional and the secretariat for research and postgraduate

13701,the new world order requires solutions integrating a sustainability oriented approach to mitigate problems associated with population increase and overexploitation of renewable and non renewable resources in this regard circular economy encourages the use of technologies that make it possible to reuse or take advantage of different types of waste thus bioprocesses and technologies focused on the recovery of value added products from wastewater can contribute to this end the present study sought to identify the scientific and technological trajectory of this area of knowledge using bibliometric analysis network analysis and patent application analysis as a first approach to understand this problem some of the most relevant results are the identification of actors and dynamics around the progress of scientific and technological production in the generation of solutions aimed at contributing to sustainable development with a particular emphasis on the need to generate technically and economically viable proposals based on adecuate policies and robust regulatory frameworks that allow for the adequate development of this activity keywords technological trajectory wastewater product recovery basic research technological development 1 introduction 1 1 sustainability and the circular economy in any economy sustainability and its associated problems require a multidisciplinary approach for adequate management 1 many of the problems posed by wastewater production can be solved by implementing resource recovery systems and through them implement actions aimed at improving sustainability 2 therefore the efficient management of these wastes and the optimization of water use must be incentivized 3 additionally any evaluation of wastewater resource recovery systems should consider not only the evaluation method but also the contexts and opinions of all stakeholders 4 this concern has been addressed by the european union eu where the criteria behind sustainable policies and the use of resources were based on guidelines provided the circular economy seeking tangible economic social and environmental benefits 5 therefore different countries have embraced circular economy because it offers an environmentally friendly alternative to the current production model 6 circular economy represents an interesting framework to integrate relevant elements such as reuse recycling and reduction although it is crucial to continue constructing the concept and increasing its accuracy and promoting its association with the notion of sustainable development 7 8 therefore circular economy can be seen as an alternative to optimize the use of resources and simultaneously decrease waste 9 it is considered to have a positive relationship with sustainability and it represents a good starting point for sustainable production 10 the expected results of circular economy and its methods will vary depending on the approach leaning either toward waste mitigation and saving resources or toward economic development 11 1 2 bioprocesses and technologies for the recovery of value added wastewater products the current approach to wastewater treatment has incorporated the recovery of value added products 12 increasing its relevance and potential for instance wastewater from fruit and vegetable processing industries contain large amounts of bioactive compounds that can be recovered not only to mitigate environmental impact but also to promote the development of other value added products 13 similarly wastewater resulting from the nixtamalization process alkaline treatment of maize allows for the recovery of gelling arabinoxylan prebiotic which is useful as a probiotic vehicle for example bifidobacterium 14 in the case of wastewater from shrimp cooking the recovery of astaxanthin and bioactive peptides can be used in important applications 15 additionally antioxidants such as melanoidins and polyphenols with potential applications in pharmacy cosmetics and food production can be obtained from wastewater generated during the distillation process of sugarcane molasses 16 concerning energy the bio electrochemical system bes provides an attractive mechanism to recover bioelectricity from wastewater as well as other components such as methane industrial chemicals hydrogen and heavy metals among others 17 similarly microbial electrosynthesis systems mess have shown their potential to provide solutions not only in terms of resource recovery but also to obtain energy sustainably through wastewater treatment 18 on the other hand microbial electrometallurgical processes are useful for the recovery of metals sn fe and cu and organic products for example acetates and polymers from wastewater produced by the manufacture of printed circuit boards prcb which contributes to compliance with disposal requirements for this type of effluent 19 electrodialysis anti fouling configurations used to treat tannery wastewater represent an option for the recovery of proteins amino acids and low molecular weight charged species while at the same time water is desalinated and treated for reuse 20 similarly the recovery of gold ions contained in gold plating wastewater can be achieved by using low cost activated carbon from agricultural waste via the absorption process 21 biorefineries can be used to transform waste from the dairy industry into useful products ranging from biofuels and bioplastics to food additives and different chemicals 22 another potentially attractive case for a biorefinery is the use of microalgae to produce biomass and energy from urban wastewater and as the primary treatment of such type of effluent 23 in fact due to their versatility microalgae have many applications in sustainable biorefineries that help to meet two critical objectives product recovery and biofuel recovery 24 a series of interesting biorefinement processes using industrial wastewater have to do with biohydrogen production 25 the biorefinery is also being used to produce cellulases and decrease pollutants in domestic wastewater 26 microbiological methods e g microremediation are being used to decrease contaminant load in wastewater from refineries for example phenols and at the same time to produce useful enzymes 27 actors in the food industry have developed applications to recover products of interest for example olive oil mills where a spray drying system can recover the product and decrease contaminant loads 28 in this type of mills phenolic compounds can also be recovered and eliminated using physical extraction and chemical and biological methods reduction of organic load 29 another example is the production of potato chips in which separation methods can mitigate the organic load of wastewater decrease water consumption and help to recover by products such as starch oil and fat which have different uses for instance in paper and soap manufacturing processes 30 the textile industry uses ultrafiltration processes to recover and reuse polyvinyl alcohol pva with the purpose of mitigating environmental impact 31 photosynthetic bacteria psb are an exciting group of microorganisms that have different functions they are used in wastewater treatment processes they produce proteins carotenoids and coenzyme q10 among others and they help to eliminate residual sludge 32 33 anaerobic processes to recover energy in the form of methane are used in the treatment of low resistance domestic wastewater 34 methanotrophs represent an option to reduce methane production during wastewater treatment methanol and biopolymers can be synergistically obtained in the process and these microorganisms also participate in biological nitrogen mitigation 35 in wastewater from egg processing plants electrocoagulation provides an alternative for the efficient recovery of protein and fat 36 for its part municipal wastewater treatment can be approached by using microalgae to obtain proteins and carbohydrates originating from the produced biomass 37 the recovery of phosphorus from sludge from urban effluents for fertilizer production is unviable due to the scarce presence of this element and the high costs associated with its production reactants and energy 38 despite the potential of phosphorus recovery from municipal waters it is important to note the technical and environmental challenges associated with replacing phosphorus contained in phosphate rocks for agricultural use 39 hydroxyapatite precipitation is one method to obtain phosphorus from acid wastewater 40 crystallization processes are viable in high phosphorus content wastewater 41 as well as in urban and livestock wastewater via struvite crystallization technologies 42 the reduction of total ammonia nitrogen tan and the recovery of total orthophosphate in wastewater from swine production is a focal point in the industry in this regard a proposed technology uses bittern as a less expensive alternative magnesium source that yields positive results in terms of performance and profitability 43 1 3 environmental policy and regulation challenges and opportunities legislative aspects socioeconomic impact safety and hygiene issues and the evaluation of heavy metal and organic micropollutant contents associated with products recovered from wastewater for example from domestic wastewater must be addressed by research as a sine qua non condition toward effective solutions 44 the following are regulatory obstacles and milestones around the world in the eu carrying out recycling and phosphorus recovery activities using wastewater requires complying with regulations established by the market and environmental and health laws 45 value added products generated from sewage sludge must be carefully evaluated for endocrine disrupting compound edc content and the presence of toxic intermediaries and to avoid further restrictions to their use storage and commercialization 46 in the eu sewage sludge storage criteria are being replaced by initiatives aimed at stabilization and safe recycling in favor of the environment and enhancing product recovery therefore it is relevant to evaluate the safety of each application for an adequate classification 47 at the legislative level several economies are prioritizing research on two key elements alternative fuels and sustainable biorefineries using waste products favoring a model centered on circular economy 48 in china industrial wastewater is marginally controlled which aggravates the environmental impact of the country s increasing economic activity 49 in response to its large demand for water resources however the country has advanced a wastewater reuse strategy

of focus in this field wastewater treatment indicators reveal the degree of sustainability associated with a technology 55 56 and the use of these indicators is also necessary for activities involving the recovery of value added products it is also essential to outline the scientific and technological trajectory of this field of knowledge to identify its current status and provide information for the design of strategies to develop original basic and applied research projects aimed at advancing technological solutions that have a positive impact at the economic social and environmental levels therefore the main goal of the present study was to provide a first approach to the scientific and technological trajectory around the recovery of value added products from wastewater 2 method the nature of technological progress is evolutionary shaped by multiple dynamics and uncertainty during its development 57 the technological innovation of products and processes is increasingly complex and innovation is a key factor for industrialization and economic growth 58 59 thus the definition of a technological trajectory technological development is quite useful to outline the state of a technology over a period of time although identifying such trajectory is of course not easy and how closely it is defined depends on the desired degree of detail specificity 60 61 the scientific trajectories basic research must also be considered in this context because science and technology often present coevolutionary dynamics 62 in this regard innovation studies can be operationalized in different ways for instance bibliometric and network analyses have proven useful in approaching and understanding regional innovation systems as a contribution to the correct design of innovation policies 63 thus different methods and tools can be used to support the identification and development of a scientific and technological trajectory in different areas of knowledge these can be considered as a starting point for the present study 1 patent analysis to identify sources of knowledge and innovation capabilities 64 2 bibliometric and co occurrence analyses keywords to map scientific knowledge 65 66 and 3 analysis of networks to understand collaboration in science and technology co authorship 67 each of these in addition to other tools provides different alternatives depending on the scope of each project and the need to delve into a specific area of knowledge the present study sought to identify the scientific and technological trajectory around the recovery of value added products from wastewater for this purpose the study procedure was divided into the following stages 1 bibliometric analysis statistical analysis of indicators 2 networking keyword author co occurrence analysis and 3 analysis of patent applications statistical analysis of indicators each of these stages involved the search for information documents and patent applications related to the terms recovery products and wastewater in two databases scopus 68 and patentscope world intellectual property organization wipo which accounts for millions of patent documents 69 they represent two robust and reliable documentary sources to search for data on science and technology in the case of scopus the search criteria were focused on documents including the aforementioned terms within the title abstract and keywords 2 828 documents title abs key recovery and title abs key products and title abs key wastewater and pubyear 1971 and pubyear 2021 this search allowed not only to analyze the production of documents using the terms over time but also to visualize such production by country knowledge area institutions and publication sources and to generate a first approach to the scientific progress of this area of study based on the same search criteria 1 708 results were obtained for the period from 2011 to 2020 title abs key recovery and title abs key products and title abs key wastewater and pubyear 2010 and pubyear 2021 these data were used in a network study based on keyword co occurrence analysis which complemented the analysis of the scientific trajectory by identifying the most relevant thematic clusters i e grouping related terms and nodes elements within the scientific production associated with the recovery of products using wastewater treatment processes subsequently to outline the progress of this industrial sector the technological trajectory was identified by searching for patent applications in the patentscope database using the same three terms used in the scopus search and the following filter options 1 advanced search 2 english 3 all offices and 4 including automatic word separation in lexemes items groups were analyzed according to the maximum of 50 results provided by the patentscope analysis bar recovery and products and wastewater as a result 20 852 patent applications were identified for the period from 1972 to 2020 revealing the countries that receive most of these applications their applicants as well as the most important technological sectors being developed in the light of this area of knowledge this methodological development made it possible to verify the vertiginous progress of basic research in the field under study and its related technologies concerning scientific production only two documents were published in 1974 but in 2019 293 were published and in the case of patent applications only one application was submitted in 1972 but a total of 1 458 were submitted in 2019 the year with most patent applications to date see fig 1 2 1 scientific trajectory 2 1 1 statistical analysis basic research ten leading economies associated with wastewater product recovery has been conducted in north america 619 documents from the united states and canada europe 630 documents from spain italy united kingdom germany and france asia 653 documents from china and india and australia 111 documents most countries in this group are classified as developed the united states and china are clearly the leaders with 509 and 495 publications respectively however other developing economies such as brazil barely made it into the 13th place with 54 publications in the study period which highlights the need to allocate more resources and establish policies to foster scientific development on problems that could be addressed by using these results under a sustainable approach in developing countries when the analysis was focused on scientific production by institution the predominance of chinese institutions in the top ten became clear these institutions are 1 chinese academy of sciences first place 2 ministry of education china third place 3 tsinghua university fourth place 4 university of the chinese academy of sciences fifth place 5 harbin institute of technology sixth place and 6 tongji university seventh place the university of queensland australia ranked second and the eighth ninth and tenth positions are occupied by ghent university belgium the wageningen university and research center netherlands and the delft university of technology netherlands respectively noticeably the united states has the highest number of publications globally but none of its institutions rank in the top ten it is also important to indicate that these ten institutions are in general highly productive table 1 shows the total number of documents registered in the scopus database for each of them as well as for their three main publication areas as can be observed in many cases the recovery of added value from wastewater could be considered a priority research area for these organizations and thus expand their participation in this type of research an analysis of the scientific production by area of knowledge shows that most of this production is related to the area of environmental science the rest is focused on strictly technical areas such as engineering chemistry chemical engineering biochemistry genetics and molecular biology energy and materials science among others the business administration and accounting area is ranked in the tenth place with a total of only 85 publications which highlights the need to increase the participation of this field but also of other disciplines within the social and economic sciences in order to develop our understanding of these issues not only from an environmental and technical perspective but also from one that integrates sustainable goals by including economic and social elements into the equation in other words it is necessary for other knowledge areas to become more involved in the study and discussion on the recovery of value added products from wastewater this increased interest would result among other things in robust legislative and regulatory frameworks increased understanding of specific needs in each context and holistic solutions see fig 2 the type of documents included in this search are as follows a article 2078 b conference paper 412 c review 199 d book chapter 79 e conference review 24 f book 13 g note 13 h report 3 i short survey 3 j erratum 2 k business article 1

a priority for the scientific community and it is taking on a prominent position in the most important journals in the world especially in publications focused on eco friendly solutions 2 1 2 network study the co occurrence exercise was carried out using the same search criteria in scopus but for the period from 2011 to 2020 in this case the analysis criteria were as follows 1 type of analysis co occurrence 2 unit of analysis author keywords and 3 counting method full counting as a result 4 331 keywords were identified of which 202 have a minimum number of five keyword occurrences in other words each of these terms appears at least five times frequency a total of 11 clusters were formed which were composed of 202 nodes and 1 508 links total link strength was 2 351 thus the five nodes with the highest number of occurrences for each cluster are the following 1 red cluster wastewater 182 pharmaceuticals 60 sludge 27 solid phase extraction 23 and ic ms ms 20 2 dark green cluster wastewater treatment 107 reverse osmosis 22 water reuse 21 nanofiltration 20 and desalination 16 3 dark blue cluster phosphorus recovery 82 struvite 81 adsorption 50 recovery 45 and calcium phosphate

biomass 16 and pyrolysis 12 10 light pink cluster life cycle assessment 20 precipitation 13 and phosphorous recovery 7 and 11 light green cluster coagulation 8 antibiotic 5 and chitosan 5 as a result of this analysis we could identify different thematic groups related to fields of knowledge such as wastewater treatment or phosphorus energy and nutrient recovery among others it was also possible to pinpoint the main bioprocesses and technologies in use and to outline areas of higher development and those with less development which represent areas of opportunity for basic science projects see fig 4 observing the arrangement and relationships among each thematic cluster reveals the interaction among the different concepts involved in the basic research on the multiple problems faced by the field as efficient solutions for the recovery of wastewater resources are developed one of the most important nodes concerns phosphorus recovery this element is intensively used in agriculture and another important element is the production of energy for industrial applications to reduce environmental impact although other widely used methods e g anaerobic digestion are also represented the figure shows the presence of less widespread techniques e g nanofiltration and evaporation among others that will likely continue growing over time as their knowledge base is developed within the framework of this field as clearly shown by the figure the recovery of value added products and wastewater treatment are frequently symbiotic 2 2 technological trajectory 2 2 1 statistical analysis a patent application analysis showed that most were submitted in the united states 9 350 in total reflecting the importance of this country as a target market for the use and application of these technologies and most of the 20 852 global results for the period from 1972 to 2020 are from six actors the united states the pct the patent cooperation treaty canada european patent office epo australia and china 20 252 documents the rest were submitted in the united kingdom israel new zealand and south africa 504 documents as well as in ten other countries not in the top ten 96 documents this result shows that the use of applications derived from technologies associated with the use of wastewater processes for product recovery is limited to a few actors and therefore other economies could also take advantage of their benefits the most outstanding american applicants are xyleco a chemical products manufacturer 72 general electric company a diversified technology and financial services company 73 strong force iot portfolio 2016 patent portfolio holding company 74 calera corporation specializing in carbon sequestration 75 e i dupont de nemours and company a producer of agricultural products and specialized products 76 and chevron usa energy services 77 in europe the leaders are shell oil company netherlands and england specialized in energy and petrochemicals 78 and basf se germany a chemical company 79 in asia toray industries japan a fiber products manufacturer 80 and the saudi arabian oil company saudi arabia involved in the entire chain of hydrocarbon exploration production commercialization and refining 81 see fig 5 however there are numerous other applicants the following is a list of examples of patent documents concerning the recovery of fluorosilicate phosphate potassium ammonium and heavy metals from wastewater 1 us20140231359 treatment of phosphate containing wastewater with fluorosilicate and phosphate recovery applicant ostara nutrient recovery technologies inc 2 us20150274562 wastewater refinery applicants grains research development corporation and the university of queensland 3 us20190002321 recovery of phosphorus compounds from wastewater applicant kemira oyj 4 ca2799294 treatment of phosphate containing wastewater applicant ostara nutrient recovery technologies inc y 5 us20180050931 process for separate removal and recovery of heavy metals from industrial wastewater applicant nanchang hangkong university 69 as can be appreciated this technological field is dominated by transnational companies which is why the broader intervention of other actors such as academia or the incursion of companies from developing economies would be desirable for these markets concerning the development of the technological areas with which the patent applications are associated according to the international patent classification ipc classes c02 f and b01d are noteworthy these classes are focused on processes designed to neutralize or attenuate harmful chemicals sediment separation treat wastewater for different purposes infrastructure and separate solids from liquids and solids from solids using a variety of techniques the rest of the categories including more than 1 000 documents are grouped into applications related to catalysis colloidal chemistry fermentation and enzymatic processes to synthesize compounds topics associated with the use of enzymes and microorganisms obtention of organic compounds by techniques such as electrolysis and the use of enzymes in the preparation of inorganic compounds among others finally the number of applications associated with processes such as cracking or pyrolysis measurement and testing of enzymatic or microbiological processes water reclamation and soluble materials among others is less than 1000 see table 2 this analysis reveals the many physical chemical or biological methods that can be used to obtain different products and enable various processes among these physical and chemical processes as well as microbiology have played a central role in applications aimed at recovering resources from wastewater 3 discussion and conclusions the development and use of technologies and bioprocesses related to the treatment and recovery of value added products in wastewater is a relevant issue that needs to be further developed by promoting scientific research and technological development to achieve effective and efficient solutions to pressing issues thus the wide range of wastewater compositions represents a potential that can be channeled via two types of applications wastewater treatment and recovery of high value added products such as energy proteins amino acids metals and organic products among many others therefore the use of these technologies becomes a priority for addressing environmental problems and mitigating industrial impact and also for integrating economic and social elements to support their sustainable development the scientific trajectory outlined in the present study shows that most of the knowledge in the area is concentrated in developed countries where well identified areas of interest and opportunity are becoming increasingly relevant therefore developing economies should increase their participation although the activity has significantly increased in recent years the reported number of documents is still short from what could be considered significant production therefore the promotion of basic research will require increased support and will be an important basis to understand horizontal and cross sectional issues on wastewater product recovery in this regard the leadership of institutions in china australia and europe is noteworthy and the participation of organizations from developing countries should take on a more significant role in the face of the sustainability problems that they are bound to face in the future undoubtedly basic research in this field represents a topic of interest for highly specialized journals this kind of research should undoubtedly include an environmental and technical scope but also an economic and social perspective data on the technological trajectory shows that applications in the field present a more vital dynamic than scientific production and the increase has been more pronounced since the year 2010 when more than 1 000 patent applications were submitted however most of these applications are filed through the united states the pct canada the european patent office australia and china which reflects the applicants interest in these territories and as in the case of the united states that it represents not only a critical consumer market but also the key technological market therefore in view of the predominance of companies from developed countries the creation of markets and the integration of proprietary technologies in developing countries is not a trivial task similarly certain technological areas have a higher concentration of technological developments associated with the treatment and recovery of wastewater products such as sludge treatment separation chemical or physical processes among others however other technological areas that have a central role in the advancement of this technological field are also growing such as material analysis and obtention of organic compounds among others despite significant progress in wastewater treatment and the recovery of value added products there are evident limitations that need to be addressed under a scientific and technological approach so that additional technically and economically feasible solutions can be developed in addition efforts directed at the economic and social development that must derive from the use of these technologies must be undertaken by the scientific community and all stakeholders in other words to achieve sustainable development all involved actors from the academia the industrial sector and the government must promote ad hoc policies to advance research and development create legislative normative and regulatory frameworks train highly specialized human resources address ethical biosecurity and intellectual property protection issues and invest in infrastructure and market development especially in developing economies where endogenous knowledge and technology must also be promoted while their natural resources and the social welfare of their most vulnerable populations are also protected the present study was intended as a first approach to the progress of this area of knowledge and its main related themes the present study adopted a general approach to the subject matter which can be considered as a limitation therefore future lines of research focused on the recovery of resources from wastewater must address specific cases and on that basis evaluate their specific benefits and problems it is also important to develop strategies toward an agenda focused on the most relevant problems in each country in particular the emphasis should be placed on developing countries facing adverse situations this scientific and technological trajectory is a starting point into this field and the purpose of the present study was to outline the general state of the scientific and technological development associated with the recovery of value added products from wastewater a more in depth view into the area will depend on the desired specificity finally actions aimed at promoting sustainable solutions must be put in place in this regard the circular economy can provide an interesting framework for such actions integrating the technical economic social and environmental aspects declaration of competing interest the authors declare no

13702,successful start up of the anaerobic ammonium oxidization anammox system is the main challenge for its application two anammox biofilm systems with pulse feeding pattern an p and constant feeding pattern an c were operated and the performance of nitrogen removal and microbial interactions among anammox bacteria heterotrophs and other microorganisms were investigated the total nitrogen removal percentage reached 82 an p and 82 4 an c in 13 days and 32 days respectively an p could start up and reach steady state quicker than an c candidatus kuenenia was the dominant functional microorganism in both reactors heterotrophs pseudomonas and hyphomicrobium might play important roles in nitrogen and carbon metabolisms n decanoyl dl homoserine lactone and n dodecanoyl dl homoserine lactone were detected and acyl homoserine lactone based quorum sensing system existed in the anammox system complex microbial interactions including competition cooperation and cross feeding co existed in the anammox system and affected system performance keywords anammox microbial interaction nutrient metabolism quorum sensing feeding pattern 1 introduction development of energy efficient wastewater treatment technology is essential for achieving the goal of sustainable wastewater treatment compared with the conventional nitrogen removal processes anaerobic ammonium oxidization anammox has been proposed as a promising technology in wastewater treatment for reducing oxygen demand organic carbon requirement and sludge production 1 in this process anammox bacteria oxidize ammonium nh4 n to nitrogen gas n2 by using nitrite no2 n as the electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions 2 due to the slow growth rate and density dependent characteristics of anammox bacteria enhancing the activity of anammox bacteria and further achieving the stable operation of anammox systems are the main challenges for applications of the anammox process 3 4 nutrient feeding patterns can affect the microbial growth and metabolism in anammox systems 5 7 the increased nitrogen load could promote the growth of candidatus brocadia 7 a low nitrogen concertation the influent nh4 n concentration of 100 mg l was beneficial to improve the nitrogen removal and microbial activity compared with a high nitrogen concentration the influent nh4 n concentration increased stepwise from 100 to 700 mg l in the anammox system 5 in addition different nutrient supply patterns might be beneficial for the growth of different types of microorganisms r strategist microorganisms could grow quickly on easily available substrates while k strategist microorganisms could use limited nutrient more efficiently 8 therefore the potential influence of feeding patterns on microbial communities and growth characteristics deserves to be further investigated biofilm has been applied for promoting the growth of anammox bacteria which is beneficial for the growth of slow growing microorganisms 9 different types and characteristics of microorganisms like anammox bacteria and heterotrophs could coexist in biofilm systems because nutrient gradients in different layers of biofilm could provide the suitable growth condition for them 10 hence complex microbial interactions among these microorganisms in nutrient metabolism and information exchange exist in the anammox system which might affect the niche of anammox bacteria and further inhibit their enrichment for example heterotrophs may participate in the nitrogen metabolism and play different roles in the anammox system some heterotrophs could reduce nitrate no3 n to n2 through denitrification or reduce no3 n to no2 n through partial denitrification which could further improve the nitrogen removal efficiency of anammox systems 7 11 on the other hand other heterotrophs might compete for no2 n with anammox bacteria which had a negative effect on the performance of autotrophic nitrogen removal 12 microbial interactions by exchanging essential metabolites known as cross feeding also occurred between anammox bacteria and heterotrophs 5 13 anammox bacteria could produce extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp which were the main carbon sources for heterotrophs in the autotrophic system 14 16 the microbial interactions of anammox bacteria and heterotrophs might occur through the exchange of smp in the anammox biofilm 14 in addition candidatus kuenenia might be the contributor for the synthesis of hydrophobic amino acids which are important components of protein in eps 17 18 information exchange through quorum sensing qs is an important pathway for microbial interactions in biofilm anammox systems which could be enhanced due to high density microorganisms 19 the acyl homoserine lactones ahls based qs system which widely exists in nitrogen removal systems might affect biofilm formation and system performance 20 22 microbial aggregation activity and growth rate of anammox bacteria could be enhanced by adding different ahls 21 the addition of n octanoyl dl homoserinelactone c8 hsl and n hexanoyl dl homoserine lactone c6 hsl could improve the settleability and activity of anammox granules 23 in addition ahls qs systems might be the main qs system for information exchange between anammox bacteria and heterotrophs 13 hence it is a potential strategy through regulating ahls to improve the activity and competitive capacity of anammox bacteria in this study performance of the anammox system with different feeding patterns was investigated furthermore the potential functions of anammox bacteria and heterotrophs and their interactions in the nitrogen metabolism and the amino acid metabolism were clarified finally the potential regulatory mechanism of the ahls qs system in the anammox system was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation different feeding patterns including pulse feeding pattern an p and constant feeding pattern an c were applied to acclimate anammox bacteria in two lab scale anammox biofilm reactors working volume of 6 l the ph of anammox reactors was not controlled which was in the range of 7 5 8 0 and the temperature was maintained at 30 1 the operational cycle of an p and an c was both 6 h but these two reactors were operated with different feeding patterns the feeding duration of an p was 10 min followed by the anaerobic anoxic reaction stage of 330 min while an c had 340 min feeding and reaction stage additionally the decanting time of an p and an c was both 20 min the biofilm carriers with anammox biomass taken from an up flow anammox biofilm reactor were used as the seed and the carrier filling ratio in both reactors was 40 the nh4 n and no2 n of 50 mg l in the synthetic wastewater were made from 91 mg l nh4cl and 246 mg l nano2 respectively other compounds were 880 mg l nahco3 1100 mg l khco3 165 mg l cacl2 2h2o 110 mg l mgso4 7h2o 33 mg l kh2po4 and trace elements solution of 3 2 ml l the composition of trace elements included 1 5 g l fecl3 6h2o 0 03 g l cuso4 6h2o 0 18 g l ki 0 15 g l h3bo3 0 15 g l cocl2 6h2o 0 12 g l znso4 7h2o 0 12 g l mncl2 4h2o 0 06 g l namoo4 2h2o and 10 g l edta c10h16n2o8 24 2 2 microbial activity and biokinetics measurements the activities of anammox bacteria denitrifiers and other nh4 n oxidizing bacteria under anoxic or anaerobic conditions in anammox systems were measured anammox carriers were taken during the stable phase of the anammox reactors after washing the carriers were re suspended with synthetic wastewater but without nh4 n and no2 n and then the mixed solution was purged with n2 until the dissolved oxygen do concentration was below 0 5 mg l the 10 ml of 400 mg l nh4 n and 10 ml of 520 mg l no2 n concentrates were added into the flask before the anammox bacteria activity experiments the duration of anammox bacteria activity experiments was 120 min and the temperature was 30 1 water samples collected during the experiments were stored at 4 to prevent the degradation of different compositions in water samples after the experiment the concentration of nh4 n was measured the activity experiments of denitrifiers were measured by adding sodium acetate and no2 n or no3 n as the carbon source and electron acceptors respectively the carriers were taken from reactors and re suspended with synthetic wastewater but without nh4 n no2 n and no3 n and then the mixed solution was also purged with n2 10 ml of 520 mg l no2 n or no3 n concentrate were added into the flask before the activity experiments of denitrifiers together with the addition of sodium acetate as the organic carbon after the experiment concentrations of no2 n or no3 n were measured the activity experiments of other nh4 n oxidizing bacteria were carried out under anoxic or anaerobic conditions through purging with n2 and the substrate of these tests was only nh4 n by adding 10 ml of 400 mg l nh4 n concentrates after the experiment the concentration of nh4 n was measured in addition the kinetic coefficients the maximum specific reaction rate and the half saturation constant of anammox bacteria were determined by batch experiments anammox carriers were suspended in 200 ml of the mixed solution without nh4 n and no2 n following the mixed solution was purged with n2 the procedures of kinetics experiments were the same as that of the activity experiments of anammox bacteria the initial substrate concentrations were adjusted by adding different substrate concentrates and the initial nh4 n concentrations were 1 0 1 5 2 0 4 0 9 0 and 18 0 mg l and the initial no2 n concentrations were 1 3 2 0 3 0 5 2 12 0 and 24 0 mg l respectively 2 3 high throughput sequencing and metagenomics analysis anammox biomass samples taken from the stable phase of the anammox reactors were used for dna extraction by fast dna spin kit illumina inc usa the specific 16s rrna gene primers of 515f and 907r were used for polymerase chain reaction pcr of the extracted dna in the v4 v5 regions 25 then high throughput sequencing was used to analyze the products of pcr through the illumina hiseq2500 platform after parsing dna sequences with the usearch software the operational taxonomic units were clustered with a similarity of 97 26 the taxonomic information of the representative sequence which was extracted as it occurred the most frequently was obtained by the silva database https www arbsilva de for metagenomic analysis the raw reads were obtained by processing the dna sequencing by the illumina hiseq x ten platform and then they were conducted by using trimmomatic to obtain clean reads which would be further assembled by the megahit software version v1 0 6 27 after that metagenemark version 3 38 was used to obtain open reading frames and the cd hit program was used to obtain the non redundant gene catalogue unigenes 28 after comparing with the ncbi nr and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes databases diamond software was applied for the taxonomic annotation of unigenes with an e value cutoff of 10 5 29 2 4 analytical methods standard methods were applied for the measurements of nh4 n nessler s reagent spectrophotometry no2 n spectrophotometric method no3 n ultraviolet spectrophotometry and volatile suspended solids vss gravimetric method 30 do and ph were measured by using the portable multimeter hq40d hach usa a heat extraction method 31 was modified to extract the loose eps and tight eps from the anammox system biomass was scraped from anammox carriers and suspended in 50 ml of phosphate buffered saline solution and then centrifuged at 6000 r min for 10 min the supernatant was filtered with the 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane filter pes ф25 0 45 μm jinteng china and recorded as the loose eps the residual biomass was re suspended in 50 ml of phosphate buffered saline solution and heated in a thermostat water bath for 40 min at 80 c the mixture was centrifuged at 11 000 r min for 15 min and the supernatant after filtration through a 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane filter was recorded as the tight eps ahls of water eps and biomass phases were extracted and detected with detailed procedures as sun et al 32 the maximum specific reaction rate qmax and half saturation constant ks for anammox bacteria were calculated by the monod equation eq 1 33 1 q q max s nh 4 n k s s nh 4 n where q max is the maximum specific reaction rate of nh4 n of anammox bacteria mg g vss d q is the oxidation rate of nh4 n of anammox bacteria mg g vss d s is the concentration of nh4 n mg l k s is the half saturation constant of anammox bacteria mg l in addition the activities of anammox bacteria denitrifiers and other nh4 n oxidizing bacteria under anoxic or anaerobic conditions were calculated by the linear fitting between concentrations of nutrients and time it is worth noting that the duration of lag period needs to be subtracted during the calculation of the activity of anammox bacteria 3 results and discussion 3 1 system performance of an p and an c nitrogen removal in the anammox systems with different feeding patterns is shown in fig 1 the total nitrogen tn removal percentage increased rapidly and reached over 80 within 13 days in an p fig 1a the values of no2 nconsumed nh4 nconsumed δno2 n δnh4 n and no3 nproduced δnh4 nconsumed δno3 n δnh4 n reached 1 13 and 0 24 fig 1c respectively which were close to theoretical values of 1 32 and 0 26 3 indicating that nitrogen was mainly removed through the anammox reaction in an p during the initial stage of an c day 1 to day 12 the tn removal percentage increased slowly from 52 6 64 1 which was lower than that of an p fig 1b and the value of δno2 n δnh4 n was only 0 53 on day 12 fig 1d unlike an p anammox reaction was not the only nitrogen conversion pathway in an c which might be due to that the constant feeding pattern was beneficial for nutrients to gradually penetrate into different layers of the biofilm and further help microorganisms grow in different layers 10 as a result an c might not only enrich anammox bacteria but also benefit the growth of other microorganisms the relative stable phase was achieved in an p day 13 32 with the tn removal percentage and the values of δno2 n δnh4 n and δno3 n δnh4 n stabilizing around 82 0 1 14 and 0 24 on day 32 respectively fig 1a and 1c during day 13 to day 32 the tn removal percentage of an c increased gradually and was close to that of an p from 67 7 82 4 fig 1b and 1d meanwhile the value of δno2 n δnh4 n reached nearly 1 0 on day 32 as the effluent no2 n concentration decreased anammox reaction gradually became the dominant nitrogen removal pathway in an c whereas an c took a longer time to reach the same nitrogen removal percentage as an p this might be due to the substrates diffusion leading to the different substrate gradients in biofilm systems 34 10 pulse feeding could provide a relatively high nitrogen load within a short period which might prompt the diffusion of substrates inside the biofilm and the rapid utilization of substrates by anammox bacteria 34 in contrast the nitrogen concentrations in the anammox system with the constant feeding pattern were always below 20 mg l which might lead to the relatively slow diffusion rate of substrates but the mechanism needs to be further studied thus pulse feeding pattern was more conducive to the rapid startup and the efficient nitrogen removal of the anammox system the failure of the heating equipment caused the temperature of an p and an c dropped from 30 to 26 on day 33 the tn removal percentage increased while the value of δno2 n δnh4 n decreased in an p and an c indicating that temperature changes had a negative effect on the activity of anammox bacteria but was beneficial to increase the activity of other nh4 n oxidizing bacteria previous studies have found that the suitable temperature for the growth of anammox bacteria was 30 to 37 and anammox activity decreased quickly as the temperature changed in the mainstream anammox system 35 37 in addition other microorganisms that could oxide nh4 n under anoxic or anaerobic conditions and the room temperature such as ammonia oxidizing archaea had a higher affinity for nh4 n than anammox bacteria in the low nitrogen strength system 38 thus this type of nh4 n oxidizing bacteria might outcompete anammox bacteria for nh4 n and their activity increased gradually during this period compared with an p the value of δno2 n δnh4 n showed a significant decrease after this perturbation durations of recovery to stable state for an p and an c were 10 and 20 days respectively these might be due to that the relatively low nitrogen concentration in an c during the reaction process which might be beneficial for the recovery of the activity of other nh4 n oxidizing bacteria instead of anammox bacteria thus the anammox system with pulse feeding pattern had strong stability and perturbation resistance meaning that the pulse feeding pattern was more suitable for the application of the anammox process 3 2 microbial activity and biokinetics the activities of anammox bacteria denitrifiers and other nh4 n oxidizing bacteria under anoxic or anaerobic conditions were measured the activity of anammox bacteria of an p was 5 4 0 4 mg nh4 n g vss h which was higher than that of an c 4 6 0 1 mg nh4 n g vss h fig s1 indicating that the anammox bacteria might have a more suitable growth condition in biofilm systems with pulse feeding pattern in addition there was a lag period nearly 60 min in the anammox bacteria activity experiments of an p and an c which might be due to that the activity of anammox bacteria was susceptible to environmental changes such as temperature and substrate concentrations 36 39 the activity of other nh4 n oxidizing bacteria existing under anoxic or anaerobic conditions were 2 1 0 1 mg nh4 n g vss h in an p and 3 1 0 2 mg nh4 n g vss h in an c fig s1 this type of bacteria had a higher activity in an c which might compete with anammox bacteria for nh4 n and influence the growth of anammox bacteria in addition the activity of denitrifiers using no2 n as the electron donor was detected in an p and an c at 2 5 0 1 and 4 7 0 3 mg no2 n g vss h respectively while the activity of denitrifiers with no3 n as the electron donor was relatively low so denitrification might occur in the anammox system hence the anammox system with pulse feeding pattern was conducive to increase the activity of anammox bacteria while the anammox system with constant feeding might be beneficial for the growth of other nh4 n oxidizing bacteria these results were consistent with the performance of nitrogen removal in an p and an c kinetic constants of anammox bacteria were calculated with the monod equation ks is a key parameter in identifying the kinetics of a microbial population as either r or k strategist 8 the values of ks calculated based on the nh4 n oxidation rate were 11 0 mg l an p and 2 5 mg l an c indicating that anammox bacteria growing in an p possessed a higher value of ks a lower substrate affinity than those growing in an c 40 hence in this study the anammox system with the pulse feeding pattern tended to enrich r strategist anammox bacteria while the system with the constant feeding pattern tended to enrich k strategist anammox bacteria the short period with a relatively high nitrogen load in an p might make it easier for anammox bacteria to utilize substrates which might result in the lower affinity for substrates and tend to enrich the r strategist anammox bacteria in contrast the constantly low concentration of substrates in an c might lead to a high affinity for substrates and tended to enrich k strategist anammox bacteria 41 3 3 microbial community and nitrogen conversion pathway analysis microbial communities in the anammox system were detected by the high throughput sequencing technique fig 2 planctomycete and chloroflexi were the dominant phylum with the relative abundance of 45 and 38 in an p and an c respectively fig 2a anammox bacteria the essential functional microorganisms were identified as a deep branching of planctomycete 4 accounting for the highest relative abundance of all microorganisms in the anammox system chloroflexi was an important heterotrophic phylum in autotrophic nitrogen removal systems which could degrade smp and eps produced by autotrophs and reinforce the structure of anammox granule 42 44 bacteria belonging to chloroflexi phylum possessed the nitrate reduction related genes which might participate in nitrogen conversions and enhance nitrogen removal percentage through reducing no3 n 16 meanwhile proteobacteria phylum had a high relative abundance this phylum contained many denitrifiers which might affect nitrogen removal in anammox systems by competing with anammox bacteria for substrates 11 in addition bacteria belonging to proteobacteria phylum could participate in the synthesis and degradation of signal molecules which might interact with other bacteria by qs 18 45 the result of the microbial community at the genus level showed that candidatus kuenenia belonging to anammox bacteria was the dominant functional microorganism in both an p and an c with the relative abundance of 34 7 and 35 7 respectively fig 2b so the dominant anammox bacteria was not affected significantly by the feeding pattern the main reason might be due to that the concentration of substrates did not reduce to zero during the reaction phase in an p meaning that the pulse feeding pattern could not provide microorganisms with a long term starvation 46 nitrosomonas belonging to ammonia oxidizing bacteria were also detected in anammox systems which could survive in anoxic or anaerobic conditions 47 48 besides the influent of the anammox system might contain a certain concentration of do which might be utilized as the substrate by nitrosomonas europae various heterotrophs were also detected in the anammox system of which ardenticatenales uncultured chloroflexi phylum was the primary heterotroph with the relative abundance accounting for 36 1 of an p and 35 2 of an c and might play an important role in nitrogen and carbon metabolisms 18 20 in addition sm1a02 made up of a relatively higher relative abundance in the anammox system which was consistent with akaboci et al 49 thus anammox bacteria and heterotrophs coexisted in an p and an c and their possible functions and interactions in nutrient metabolism and information exchange would be further analyzed by metagenomics analysis nitrogen metabolism related functional genes and their related genera were detected through metagenomics the genes of nirk and nirs encoded nitrite reductase were detected in an p and an c and the relative abundance of nirk 0 02 was higher than that of nirs 0 004 fig 3 these genes were the first step of the biochemical pathway of anammox bacteria which could reduce no2 n to no 50 the genes of nir were mainly harbored by candidatus kuenenia but some heterotrophs also possessed these genes such as pseudomonas and candidatus accumulibacter thus these heterotrophs could participate in nitrogen conversions and might compete with anammox bacteria for no2 n thereby affecting nitrogen removal in addition hdh and hzs encoded hydrazine dehydrogenase and hydrazine synthase were the important functional genes of anammox reaction 50 due to the limitation of kegg database these genes were not annotated the genes related to nitrification and denitrification processes and their related genera were detected in an p and an c ammonium monooxygenase amo the important gene for the oxidation of nh4 n was only harbored by nitrosomonas europaea fig 3 the results of activity experiments showed that other nh4 n oxidation bacteria existing under anoxic or anaerobic condition could oxidize nh4 n to no2 n in the anammox system therefore nitrosomonas europaea was likely to be these bacteria of nh4 n oxidation meanwhile other undetected bacteria might also have this function of oxidizing nh4 n to no2 n under anoxic or anaerobic condition except for functional microorganisms many nitrogen metabolism related genes were harbored by denitrifiers including pseudomonas hyphomicrobium and rhodanobacter which could participate in multiple nitrogen conversions additionally the species and functions of microorganisms involved in nitrogen metabolism in an p were the same as those of an c indicating that the feeding pattern had little effect on the microbial community associated with nitrogen metabolism this might be due to biofilm systems could provide suitable growth conditions for different types of microorganisms reducing the impact of environment changes on the growth of microorganisms 10 3 4 eps content and amino acid metabolism eps containing high amounts of protein and polysaccharides plays a key role in bacterial aggregation which could achieve the high microbial density and further influence the activity of anammox bacteria 15 51 in addition many heterotrophs could use macromolecular substances of eps as carbon sources to exist in the anammox system without the addition of organic substrate 16 hence eps might be a crucial substance for the microbial interaction between anammox bacteria and heterotrophs tight eps was the main component accounting for the large mounts of all eps in the anammox system the amount of loose eps was relatively lower comparing to that of tight eps with values of only 1 6 mg g vss an p and 1 7 mg g vss an c eps is conducive to enhance the aggregation capacity of anammox bacteria in the biofilm and make the stable structure of anammox biofilm 52 protein was the major component in tight eps and its content in an p and an c was 27 3 mg g vss and 28 4 mg g vss respectively fig s2 while the amount of polysaccharide was 11 4 mg g vss in an p and 13 1 mg g vss in an c this might be due to that nutrients were more likely to be converted into protein than polysaccharide in the autotrophic cultures 53 the degradation of eps generated by anammox bacteria could provide heterotrophs with amino acid an important organic carbon to support their growth in anammox systems 14 15 meanwhile the increased content of hydrophobic amino acids might be beneficial to improve the hydrophobicity of anammox bacteria and the stability of the anammox biofilm 54 many amino acid synthesis genes were detected in the anammox system fig s2 the related amino acids were classified based on the value of the biosynthesis cost reported by akashi and gojobori 55 the relative abundance of synthesis genes of relatively cheaper amino acids aspartate glutamate serine and glycine was high implying that microorganisms had a strong potential to synthesize cheaper amino acids and preferred to utilize these amino acids in the anammox system 5 consistent with mee et al 56 some microorganisms had priority to utilize amino acids with a low synthesis cost to achieve a high biosynthesis efficiency among these amino acids the relative abundance of yhdr encoding the synthesis gene of glutamate was the highest fig 4 a glutamate a major component of extracellular protein had a high content in the anammox system and the increased content of glutamate could promote the synthesis of extracellular protein 13 serine and glycine related synthesis genes were also relatively high so these amino acids might be generated in large quantities and used by different microorganisms in the anammox system besides the amino acid degradation genes of valine were relatively high indicating that valine might not be the main amino acid to promote the synthesis of extracellular proteins in addition feeding patterns had little influence on amino acid metabolism pathways in an p and an c which might be due to that feeding patterns did not change microbial metabolisms in this study candidatus kuenenia playing an important role in the synthesis of amino acids harbored 10 amino acid synthesis genes including serine glycine aspartate and glutamine which might have complex microbial interactions of cross feeding with other microorganisms fig 4a meanwhile candidatus kuenenia harbored the degradation genes of aspartate threonine valine and leucine implying that anammox bacteria also had potential to degrade these amino acids therefore candidatus kuenenia was likely to act as an amino acid producer and maintain the content of amino acid in the anammox system in addition nitrosomonas also harbored multiple amino acid synthesis genes and might be involved in the synthesis of different types of amino acids for heterotrophs hyphomicrobium anaerolinea and roseovarius harbored 9 9 and 12 amino acid synthesis genes respectively which were the important heterotrophs participating in amino acid metabolism since these heterotrophs harbored both the synthesis genes of cheaper amino acids and costly amino acids they might be crucial producers of amino acids and play different roles in microbial interactions 57 in addition burkholderia candidatus accumulibacter and methyloversatilis mainly harbored synthesis genes of the costly amino acids tryptophan and phenylalanine these heterotrophs were likely to have an important functional niche in the amino acids metabolism of an p and an c which might be more conducive to efficient microbial interactions through cross feeding between anammox bacteria and heterotrophs 56 it is worth noting that isosphaera was the only bacteria harboring amino acid degradation genes of costly amino acids fig 4b and might have a cooperative relationship with other heterotrophs in the cross feeding process 58 additionally few microorganisms harbored degradation genes of cheaper amino acids the degradation gene of serine was only harbored by pseudomonas while the degradation gene of glycine was possessed by pseudomonas and chloroflexus amino acids or peptides could be degraded into carbon containing intermediates by heterotrophs 16 thus in this study pseudomonas and chloroflexus might provide carbon containing intermediates for other heterotrophs through microbial interactions 3 5 microbial information exchange based on the ahls quorum sensing system ahls based qs systems are important for microbial information exchange in biological nitrogen removal systems 23 59 the relative abundance of ahls related genes and their related genus are shown in fig 5 the synthesis genes of ahls rpal and the sensing genes of ahls rapr were detected in an p and anc indicating that microorganisms might exchange information through the ahls based qs systems the relative abundance of hdts was significantly higher than that of other synthesis genes fig 5a so it might be the most important synthesis genes of ahls in the anammox system which was consistent with tang et al 59 and laue et al 60 additionally acylase could degrade ahls by cleaving amide bonds of ahls 61 the relative abundance of the gene encoding acylase in a nc was slightly higher than that of a np implying that the more complex balance between the ahl qs and ahl quorum quenching qq might exist in a nc in addition the genes related to diffusible signal factor and autoinducers 2 were also detected in the anammox system so microbial information exchange was also likely to occur through these types of qs systems but the specific mechanism needs to be further studied hdts was mainly harbored by candidatus kuenenia which also had the potential to produce ahls fig 5b hyphomicrobium and methylobacterium possessed rpal and hdts so these microorganisms could synthesize ahls through two synthesis pathways rpar was harbored by bradyrhizobium and rhodopseudomonas which could be used to sense ahls thus hyphomicrobium methylobacterium bradyrhizobium and rhodopseudomonas might cooperate to achieve the synthesis and sensing of ahls additionally geobacter burkholderia isosphaera and other heterotrophs also harbored hdts hence ahls qs system was likely to be used for microbial interactions of information exchange between autotrophs and heterotrophs in the anammox system the degradation gene of ahls was possessed by candidatus microthrix gemmatimonas and salinispira which were the main qq genus in the anammox system microbial interactions among these heterotrophs and anammox bacteria might also control the balance of ahls qs and ahls qq in the anammox system to verify the existence of ahls qs in an p and an c the diversity distribution and concentration of ahls were detected fig 5c c8 hsl n butyryl dl homoserine lactone c4 hsl n decanoyl dl homoserine lactone c10 hsl and n dodecanoyl dl homoserine lactone c12 hsl were detected in an p and an c and ahls were mainly concentrated in the eps phase the total concentrations of ahls in the eps phase were 231 9 ng g vss an p and 207 5 ng g vss an c while those in the biomass phase were 128 4 ng g vss an p and 113 7 ng g vss an c fig 5c the regulation mechanism of ahls qs systems showed that after the production of ahls in the biomass phase ahls would diffuse freely and accumulate in the eps phase when ahls accumulated to a significant concentration these signal substances would diffuse into the cell overwhelms export and activate the transcription of the target gene 62 the concentration of c10 hsl was 184 2 ng g vss an p and 166 8 ng g vss an c in the eps phase accounting for 79 4 an p and 80 4 an c of the total concentration of ahls in this phase meanwhile c10 hsl made up of 61 6 an p and 59 3 an c of the total concentration of ahls in the biomass phase therefore c10 hsl was the main ahls in the anammox system fig 5c previous studies also found that c10 hsl existed in anammox based systems which might be beneficial to produce eps and enrich anammox bacteria 17 18 in addition c12 hsl was also an important ahls in an p and an c and the content of c12 hsl in the biomass phase was slightly higher than that of the eps phase tang et al 63 detected c12 hsl and c8 hsl in the anammox system and found that c12 hsl might have a negative effect on the activity of anammox bacteria previous studies have found that some heterotrophs could produce c12 hsl such as pseudomonas sp 1a1 and rhodococcus sp bh4 64 65 this indicated that c12 hsl might be produced by heterotrophs rather than anammox bacteria hence c10 hsl and c12 hsl might play different roles in the anammox system further affecting the enrichment of different types of bacteria 3 6 potential microbial interactions in an p and an c candidatus kuenenia and heterotrophs coexisted in the anammox system fig 6 6 genera harbored genes relating to nitrogen metabolism amino acid metabolism and ahls qs system including 2 genera of autotrophs candidatus kuenenia and ntrosomonas and 4 genera of heterotrophs hyphomicrobium geobacter burkholderia and candidatus accumulibacter these four heterotrophs might affect the performance of nitrogen removal the production of eps and the synthesis or degradation of ahls which were also likely to have an important functional niche in the anammox system nitrogen and carbon metabolisms related genes were not only possessed by anammox bacteria but also harbored by pseudomonas and nitrososipra pseudomonas might have the potential to synthesize or degrade amino acids which could provide amino acids by themselves or other heterotrophs as carbon sources 16 in addition 5 heterotrophs possessed the genes related to both amino acid metabolism and the ahls qs system so cooperative or competitive interactions might exist in the process of the degradation of amino acids and ahls based information exchanges but the possible mechanism needs to be further explored 4 conclusions an p had a stronger stability and perturbation resistance than an c and the pulse feeding pattern was an effective strategy for the application of the anammox process candidatus kuenenia was the dominant functional microorganism and played an important role in the nitrogen conversion and the amino acids metabolism many heterotrophs existed in the anammox system and there were complex interactions between anammox bacteria and heterotrophs by cross feeding and information exchange ahls based qs system c10 hsl and c12 hsl were the main signal substances in this study which might play important roles in microbial interactions declaration of competing interest the authors report no

13702,successful start up of the anaerobic ammonium oxidization anammox system is the main challenge for its application two anammox biofilm systems with pulse feeding pattern an p and constant feeding pattern an c were operated and the performance of nitrogen removal and microbial interactions among anammox bacteria heterotrophs and other microorganisms were investigated the total nitrogen removal percentage reached 82 an p and 82 4 an c in 13 days and 32 days respectively an p could start up and reach steady state quicker than an c candidatus kuenenia was the dominant functional microorganism in both reactors heterotrophs pseudomonas and hyphomicrobium might play important roles in nitrogen and carbon metabolisms n decanoyl dl homoserine lactone and n dodecanoyl dl homoserine lactone were detected and acyl homoserine lactone based quorum sensing system existed in the anammox system complex microbial interactions including competition cooperation and cross feeding co existed in the anammox system and affected system performance keywords anammox microbial interaction nutrient metabolism quorum sensing feeding pattern 1 introduction development of energy efficient wastewater treatment technology is essential for achieving the goal of sustainable wastewater treatment compared with the conventional nitrogen removal processes anaerobic ammonium oxidization anammox has been proposed as a promising technology in wastewater treatment for reducing oxygen demand organic carbon requirement and sludge production 1 in this process anammox bacteria oxidize ammonium nh4 n to nitrogen gas n2 by using nitrite no2 n as the electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions 2 due to the slow growth rate and density dependent characteristics of anammox bacteria enhancing the activity of anammox bacteria and further achieving the stable operation of anammox systems are the main challenges for applications of the anammox process 3 4 nutrient feeding patterns can affect the microbial growth and metabolism in anammox systems 5 7 the increased nitrogen load could promote the growth of candidatus brocadia 7 a low nitrogen concertation the influent nh4 n concentration of 100 mg l was beneficial to improve the nitrogen removal and microbial activity compared with a high nitrogen concentration the influent nh4 n concentration increased stepwise from 100 to 700 mg l in the anammox system 5 in addition different nutrient supply patterns might be beneficial for the growth of different types of microorganisms r strategist microorganisms could grow quickly on easily available substrates while k strategist microorganisms could use limited nutrient more efficiently 8 therefore the potential influence of feeding patterns on microbial communities and growth characteristics deserves to be further investigated biofilm has been applied for promoting the growth of anammox bacteria which is beneficial for the growth of slow growing microorganisms 9 different types and characteristics of microorganisms like anammox bacteria and heterotrophs could coexist in biofilm systems because nutrient gradients in different layers of biofilm could provide the suitable growth condition for them 10 hence complex microbial interactions among these microorganisms in nutrient metabolism and information exchange exist in the anammox system which might affect the niche of anammox bacteria and further inhibit their enrichment for example heterotrophs may participate in the nitrogen metabolism and play different roles in the anammox system some heterotrophs could reduce nitrate no3 n to n2 through denitrification or reduce no3 n to no2 n through partial denitrification which could further improve the nitrogen removal efficiency of anammox systems 7 11 on the other hand other heterotrophs might compete for no2 n with anammox bacteria which had a negative effect on the performance of autotrophic nitrogen removal 12 microbial interactions by exchanging essential metabolites known as cross feeding also occurred between anammox bacteria and heterotrophs 5 13 anammox bacteria could produce extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp which were the main carbon sources for heterotrophs in the autotrophic system 14 16 the microbial interactions of anammox bacteria and heterotrophs might occur through the exchange of smp in the anammox biofilm 14 in addition candidatus kuenenia might be the contributor for the synthesis of hydrophobic amino acids which are important components of protein in eps 17 18 information exchange through quorum sensing qs is an important pathway for microbial interactions in biofilm anammox systems which could be enhanced due to high density microorganisms 19 the acyl homoserine lactones ahls based qs system which widely exists in nitrogen removal systems might affect biofilm formation and system performance 20 22 microbial aggregation activity and growth rate of anammox bacteria could be enhanced by adding different ahls 21 the addition of n octanoyl dl homoserinelactone c8 hsl and n hexanoyl dl homoserine lactone c6 hsl could improve the settleability and activity of anammox granules 23 in addition ahls qs systems might be the main qs system for information exchange between anammox bacteria and heterotrophs 13 hence it is a potential strategy through regulating ahls to improve the activity and competitive capacity of anammox bacteria in this study performance of the anammox system with different feeding patterns was investigated furthermore the potential functions of anammox bacteria and heterotrophs and their interactions in the nitrogen metabolism and the amino acid metabolism were clarified finally the potential regulatory mechanism of the ahls qs system in the anammox system was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation different feeding patterns including pulse feeding pattern an p and constant feeding pattern an c were applied to acclimate anammox bacteria in two lab scale anammox biofilm reactors working volume of 6 l the ph of anammox reactors was not controlled which was in the range of 7 5 8 0 and the temperature was maintained at 30 1 the operational cycle of an p and an c was both 6 h but these two reactors were operated with different feeding patterns the feeding duration of an p was 10 min followed by the anaerobic anoxic reaction stage of 330 min while an c had 340 min feeding and reaction stage additionally the decanting time of an p and an c was both 20 min the biofilm carriers with anammox biomass taken from an up flow anammox biofilm reactor were used as the seed and the carrier filling ratio in both reactors was 40 the nh4 n and no2 n of 50 mg l in the synthetic wastewater were made from 91 mg l nh4cl and 246 mg l nano2 respectively other compounds were 880 mg l nahco3 1100 mg l khco3 165 mg l cacl2 2h2o 110 mg l mgso4 7h2o 33 mg l kh2po4 and trace elements solution of 3 2 ml l the composition of trace elements included 1 5 g l fecl3 6h2o 0 03 g l cuso4 6h2o 0 18 g l ki 0 15 g l h3bo3 0 15 g l cocl2 6h2o 0 12 g l znso4 7h2o 0 12 g l mncl2 4h2o 0 06 g l namoo4 2h2o and 10 g l edta c10h16n2o8 24 2 2 microbial activity and biokinetics measurements the activities of anammox bacteria denitrifiers and other nh4 n oxidizing bacteria under anoxic or anaerobic conditions in anammox systems were measured anammox carriers were taken during the stable phase of the anammox reactors after washing the carriers were re suspended with synthetic wastewater but without nh4 n and no2 n and then the mixed solution was purged with n2 until the dissolved oxygen do concentration was below 0 5 mg l the 10 ml of 400 mg l nh4 n and 10 ml of 520 mg l no2 n concentrates were added into the flask before the anammox bacteria activity experiments the duration of anammox bacteria activity experiments was 120 min and the temperature was 30 1 water samples collected during the experiments were stored at 4 to prevent the degradation of different compositions in water samples after the experiment the concentration of nh4 n was measured the activity experiments of denitrifiers were measured by adding sodium acetate and no2 n or no3 n as the carbon source and electron acceptors respectively the carriers were taken from reactors and re suspended with synthetic wastewater but without nh4 n no2 n and no3 n and then the mixed solution was also purged with n2 10 ml of 520 mg l no2 n or no3 n concentrate were added into the flask before the activity experiments of denitrifiers together with the addition of sodium acetate as the organic carbon after the experiment concentrations of no2 n or no3 n were measured the activity experiments of other nh4 n oxidizing bacteria were carried out under anoxic or anaerobic conditions through purging with n2 and the substrate of these tests was only nh4 n by adding 10 ml of 400 mg l nh4 n concentrates after the experiment the concentration of nh4 n was measured in addition the kinetic coefficients the maximum specific reaction rate and the half saturation constant of anammox bacteria were determined by batch experiments anammox carriers were suspended in 200 ml of the mixed solution without nh4 n and no2 n following the mixed solution was purged with n2 the procedures of kinetics experiments were the same as that of the activity experiments of anammox bacteria the initial substrate concentrations were adjusted by adding different substrate concentrates and the initial nh4 n concentrations were 1 0 1 5 2 0 4 0 9 0 and 18 0 mg l and the initial no2 n concentrations were 1 3 2 0 3 0 5 2 12 0 and 24 0 mg l respectively 2 3 high throughput sequencing and metagenomics analysis anammox biomass samples taken from the stable phase of the anammox reactors were used for dna extraction by fast dna spin kit illumina inc usa the specific 16s rrna gene primers of 515f and 907r were used for polymerase chain reaction pcr of the extracted dna in the v4 v5 regions 25 then high throughput sequencing was used to analyze the products of pcr through the illumina hiseq2500 platform after parsing dna sequences with the usearch software the operational taxonomic units were clustered with a similarity of 97 26 the taxonomic information of the representative sequence which was extracted as it occurred the most frequently was obtained by the silva database https www arbsilva de for metagenomic analysis the raw reads were obtained by processing the dna sequencing by the illumina hiseq x ten platform and then they were conducted by using trimmomatic to obtain clean reads which would be further assembled by the megahit software version v1 0 6 27 after that metagenemark version 3 38 was used to obtain open reading frames and the cd hit program was used to obtain the non redundant gene catalogue unigenes 28 after comparing with the ncbi nr and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes databases diamond software was applied for the taxonomic annotation of unigenes with an e value cutoff of 10 5 29 2 4 analytical methods standard methods were applied for the measurements of nh4 n nessler s reagent spectrophotometry no2 n spectrophotometric method no3 n ultraviolet spectrophotometry and volatile suspended solids vss gravimetric method 30 do and ph were measured by using the portable multimeter hq40d hach usa a heat extraction method 31 was modified to extract the loose eps and tight eps from the anammox system biomass was scraped from anammox carriers and suspended in 50 ml of phosphate buffered saline solution and then centrifuged at 6000 r min for 10 min the supernatant was filtered with the 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane filter pes ф25 0 45 μm jinteng china and recorded as the loose eps the residual biomass was re suspended in 50 ml of phosphate buffered saline solution and heated in a thermostat water bath for 40 min at 80 c the mixture was centrifuged at 11 000 r min for 15 min and the supernatant after filtration through a 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane filter was recorded as the tight eps ahls of water eps and biomass phases were extracted and detected with detailed procedures as sun et al 32 the maximum specific reaction rate qmax and half saturation constant ks for anammox bacteria were calculated by the monod equation eq 1 33 1 q q max s nh 4 n k s s nh 4 n where q max is the maximum specific reaction rate of nh4 n of anammox bacteria mg g vss d q is the oxidation rate of nh4 n of anammox bacteria mg g vss d s is the concentration of nh4 n mg l k s is the half saturation constant of anammox bacteria mg l in addition the activities of anammox bacteria denitrifiers and other nh4 n oxidizing bacteria under anoxic or anaerobic conditions were calculated by the linear fitting between concentrations of nutrients and time it is worth noting that the duration of lag period needs to be subtracted during the calculation of the activity of anammox bacteria 3 results and discussion 3 1 system performance of an p and an c nitrogen removal in the anammox systems with different feeding patterns is shown in fig 1 the total nitrogen tn removal percentage increased rapidly and reached over 80 within 13 days in an p fig 1a the values of no2 nconsumed nh4 nconsumed δno2 n δnh4 n and no3 nproduced δnh4 nconsumed δno3 n δnh4 n reached 1 13 and 0 24 fig 1c respectively which were close to theoretical values of 1 32 and 0 26 3 indicating that nitrogen was mainly removed through the anammox reaction in an p during the initial stage of an c day 1 to day 12 the tn removal percentage increased slowly from 52 6 64 1 which was lower than that of an p fig 1b and the value of δno2 n δnh4 n was only 0 53 on day 12 fig 1d unlike an p anammox reaction was not the only nitrogen conversion pathway in an c which might be due to that the constant feeding pattern was beneficial for nutrients to gradually penetrate into different layers of the biofilm and further help microorganisms grow in different layers 10 as a result an c might not only enrich anammox bacteria but also benefit the growth of other microorganisms the relative stable phase was achieved in an p day 13 32 with the tn removal percentage and the values of δno2 n δnh4 n and δno3 n δnh4 n stabilizing around 82 0 1 14 and 0 24 on day 32 respectively fig 1a and 1c during day 13 to day 32 the tn removal percentage of an c increased gradually and was close to that of an p from 67 7 82 4 fig 1b and 1d meanwhile the value of δno2 n δnh4 n reached nearly 1 0 on day 32 as the effluent no2 n concentration decreased anammox reaction gradually became the dominant nitrogen removal pathway in an c whereas an c took a longer time to reach the same nitrogen removal percentage as an p this might be due to the substrates diffusion leading to the different substrate gradients in biofilm systems 34 10 pulse feeding could provide a relatively high nitrogen load within a short period which might prompt the diffusion of substrates inside the biofilm and the rapid utilization of substrates by anammox bacteria 34 in contrast the nitrogen concentrations in the anammox system with the constant feeding pattern were always below 20 mg l which might lead to the relatively slow diffusion rate of substrates but the mechanism needs to be further studied thus pulse feeding pattern was more conducive to the rapid startup and the efficient nitrogen removal of the anammox system the failure of the heating equipment caused the temperature of an p and an c dropped from 30 to 26 on day 33 the tn removal percentage increased while the value of δno2 n δnh4 n decreased in an p and an c indicating that temperature changes had a negative effect on the activity of anammox bacteria but was beneficial to increase the activity of other nh4 n oxidizing bacteria previous studies have found that the suitable temperature for the growth of anammox bacteria was 30 to 37 and anammox activity decreased quickly as the temperature changed in the mainstream anammox system 35 37 in addition other microorganisms that could oxide nh4 n under anoxic or anaerobic conditions and the room temperature such as ammonia oxidizing archaea had a higher affinity for nh4 n than anammox bacteria in the low nitrogen strength system 38 thus this type of nh4 n oxidizing bacteria might outcompete anammox bacteria for nh4 n and their activity increased gradually during this period compared with an p the value of δno2 n δnh4 n showed a significant decrease after this perturbation durations of recovery to stable state for an p and an c were 10 and 20 days respectively these might be due to that the relatively low nitrogen concentration in an c during the reaction process which might be beneficial for the recovery of the activity of other nh4 n oxidizing bacteria instead of anammox bacteria thus the anammox system with pulse feeding pattern had strong stability and perturbation resistance meaning that the pulse feeding pattern was more suitable for the application of the anammox process 3 2 microbial activity and biokinetics the activities of anammox bacteria denitrifiers and other nh4 n oxidizing bacteria under anoxic or anaerobic conditions were measured the activity of anammox bacteria of an p was 5 4 0 4 mg nh4 n g vss h which was higher than that of an c 4 6 0 1 mg nh4 n g vss h fig s1 indicating that the anammox bacteria might have a more suitable growth condition in biofilm systems with pulse feeding pattern in addition there was a lag period nearly 60 min in the anammox bacteria activity experiments of an p and an c which might be due to that the activity of anammox bacteria was susceptible to environmental changes such as temperature and substrate concentrations 36 39 the activity of other nh4 n oxidizing bacteria existing under anoxic or anaerobic conditions were 2 1 0 1 mg nh4 n g vss h in an p and 3 1 0 2 mg nh4 n g vss h in an c fig s1 this type of bacteria had a higher activity in an c which might compete with anammox bacteria for nh4 n and influence the growth of anammox bacteria in addition the activity of denitrifiers using no2 n as the electron donor was detected in an p and an c at 2 5 0 1 and 4 7 0 3 mg no2 n g vss h respectively while the activity of denitrifiers with no3 n as the electron donor was relatively low so denitrification might occur in the anammox system hence the anammox system with pulse feeding pattern was conducive to increase the activity of anammox bacteria while the anammox system with constant feeding might be beneficial for the growth of other nh4 n oxidizing bacteria these results were consistent with the performance of nitrogen removal in an p and an c kinetic constants of anammox bacteria were calculated with the monod equation ks is a key parameter in identifying the kinetics of a microbial population as either r or k strategist 8 the values of ks calculated based on the nh4 n oxidation rate were 11 0 mg l an p and 2 5 mg l an c indicating that anammox bacteria growing in an p possessed a higher value of ks a lower substrate affinity than those growing in an c 40 hence in this study the anammox system with the pulse feeding pattern tended to enrich r strategist anammox bacteria while the system with the constant feeding pattern tended to enrich k strategist anammox bacteria the short period with a relatively high nitrogen load in an p might make it easier for anammox bacteria to utilize substrates which might result in the lower affinity for substrates and tend to enrich the r strategist anammox bacteria in contrast the constantly low concentration of substrates in an c might lead to a high affinity for substrates and tended to enrich k strategist anammox bacteria 41 3 3 microbial community and nitrogen conversion pathway analysis microbial communities in the anammox system were detected by the high throughput sequencing technique fig 2 planctomycete and chloroflexi were the dominant phylum with the relative abundance of 45 and 38 in an p and an c respectively fig 2a anammox bacteria the essential functional microorganisms were identified as a deep branching of planctomycete 4 accounting for the highest relative abundance of all microorganisms in the anammox system chloroflexi was an important heterotrophic phylum in autotrophic nitrogen removal systems which could degrade smp and eps produced by autotrophs and reinforce the structure of anammox granule 42 44 bacteria belonging to chloroflexi phylum possessed the nitrate reduction related genes which might participate in nitrogen conversions and enhance nitrogen removal percentage through reducing no3 n 16 meanwhile proteobacteria phylum had a high relative abundance this phylum contained many denitrifiers which might affect nitrogen removal in anammox systems by competing with anammox bacteria for substrates 11 in addition bacteria belonging to proteobacteria phylum could participate in the synthesis and degradation of signal molecules which might interact with other bacteria by qs 18 45 the result of the microbial community at the genus level showed that candidatus kuenenia belonging to anammox bacteria was the dominant functional microorganism in both an p and an c with the relative abundance of 34 7 and 35 7 respectively fig 2b so the dominant anammox bacteria was not affected significantly by the feeding pattern the main reason might be due to that the concentration of substrates did not reduce to zero during the reaction phase in an p meaning that the pulse feeding pattern could not provide microorganisms with a long term starvation 46 nitrosomonas belonging to ammonia oxidizing bacteria were also detected in anammox systems which could survive in anoxic or anaerobic conditions 47 48 besides the influent of the anammox system might contain a certain concentration of do which might be utilized as the substrate by nitrosomonas europae various heterotrophs were also detected in the anammox system of which ardenticatenales uncultured chloroflexi phylum was the primary heterotroph with the relative abundance accounting for 36 1 of an p and 35 2 of an c and might play an important role in nitrogen and carbon metabolisms 18 20 in addition sm1a02 made up of a relatively higher relative abundance in the anammox system which was consistent with akaboci et al 49 thus anammox bacteria and heterotrophs coexisted in an p and an c and their possible functions and interactions in nutrient metabolism and information exchange would be further analyzed by metagenomics analysis nitrogen metabolism related functional genes and their related genera were detected through metagenomics the genes of nirk and nirs encoded nitrite reductase were detected in an p and an c and the relative abundance of nirk 0 02 was higher than that of nirs 0 004 fig 3 these genes were the first step of the biochemical pathway of anammox bacteria which could reduce no2 n to no 50 the genes of nir were mainly harbored by candidatus kuenenia but some heterotrophs also possessed these genes such as pseudomonas and candidatus accumulibacter thus these heterotrophs could participate in nitrogen conversions and might compete with anammox bacteria for no2 n thereby affecting nitrogen removal in addition hdh and hzs encoded hydrazine dehydrogenase and hydrazine synthase were the important functional genes of anammox reaction 50 due to the limitation of kegg database these genes were not annotated the genes related to nitrification and denitrification processes and their related genera were detected in an p and an c ammonium monooxygenase amo the important gene for the oxidation of nh4 n was only harbored by nitrosomonas europaea fig 3 the results of activity experiments showed that other nh4 n oxidation bacteria existing under anoxic or anaerobic condition could oxidize nh4 n to no2 n in the anammox system therefore nitrosomonas europaea was likely to be these bacteria of nh4 n oxidation meanwhile other undetected bacteria might also have this function of oxidizing nh4 n to no2 n under anoxic or anaerobic condition except for functional microorganisms many nitrogen metabolism related genes were harbored by denitrifiers including pseudomonas hyphomicrobium and rhodanobacter which could participate in multiple nitrogen conversions additionally the species and functions of microorganisms involved in nitrogen metabolism in an p were the same as those of an c indicating that the feeding pattern had little effect on the microbial community associated with nitrogen metabolism this might be due to biofilm systems could provide suitable growth conditions for different types of microorganisms reducing the impact of environment changes on the growth of microorganisms 10 3 4 eps content and amino acid metabolism eps containing high amounts of protein and polysaccharides plays a key role in bacterial aggregation which could achieve the high microbial density and further influence the activity of anammox bacteria 15 51 in addition many heterotrophs could use macromolecular substances of eps as carbon sources to exist in the anammox system without the addition of organic substrate 16 hence eps might be a crucial substance for the microbial interaction between anammox bacteria and heterotrophs tight eps was the main component accounting for the large mounts of all eps in the anammox system the amount of loose eps was relatively lower comparing to that of tight eps with values of only 1 6 mg g vss an p and 1 7 mg g vss an c eps is conducive to enhance the aggregation capacity of anammox bacteria in the biofilm and make the stable structure of anammox biofilm 52 protein was the major component in tight eps and its content in an p and an c was 27 3 mg g vss and 28 4 mg g vss respectively fig s2 while the amount of polysaccharide was 11 4 mg g vss in an p and 13 1 mg g vss in an c this might be due to that nutrients were more likely to be converted into protein than polysaccharide in the autotrophic cultures 53 the degradation of eps generated by anammox bacteria could provide heterotrophs with amino acid an important organic carbon to support their growth in anammox systems 14 15 meanwhile the increased content of hydrophobic amino acids might be beneficial to improve the hydrophobicity of anammox bacteria and the stability of the anammox biofilm 54 many amino acid synthesis genes were detected in the anammox system fig s2 the related amino acids were classified based on the value of the biosynthesis cost reported by akashi and gojobori 55 the relative abundance of synthesis genes of relatively cheaper amino acids aspartate glutamate serine and glycine was high implying that microorganisms had a strong potential to synthesize cheaper amino acids and preferred to utilize these amino acids in the anammox system 5 consistent with mee et al 56 some microorganisms had priority to utilize amino acids with a low synthesis cost to achieve a high biosynthesis efficiency among these amino acids the relative abundance of yhdr encoding the synthesis gene of glutamate was the highest fig 4 a glutamate a major component of extracellular protein had a high content in the anammox system and the increased content of glutamate could promote the synthesis of extracellular protein 13 serine and glycine related synthesis genes were also relatively high so these amino acids might be generated in large quantities and used by different microorganisms in the anammox system besides the amino acid degradation genes of valine were relatively high indicating that valine might not be the main amino acid to promote the synthesis of extracellular proteins in addition feeding patterns had little influence on amino acid metabolism pathways in an p and an c which might be due to that feeding patterns did not change microbial metabolisms in this study candidatus kuenenia playing an important role in the synthesis of amino acids harbored 10 amino acid synthesis genes including serine glycine aspartate and glutamine which might have complex microbial interactions of cross feeding with other microorganisms fig 4a meanwhile candidatus kuenenia harbored the degradation genes of aspartate threonine valine and leucine implying that anammox bacteria also had potential to degrade these amino acids therefore candidatus kuenenia was likely to act as an amino acid producer and maintain the content of amino acid in the anammox system in addition nitrosomonas also harbored multiple amino acid synthesis genes and might be involved in the synthesis of different types of amino acids for heterotrophs hyphomicrobium anaerolinea and roseovarius harbored 9 9 and 12 amino acid synthesis genes respectively which were the important heterotrophs participating in amino acid metabolism since these heterotrophs harbored both the synthesis genes of cheaper amino acids and costly amino acids they might be crucial producers of amino acids and play different roles in microbial interactions 57 in addition burkholderia candidatus accumulibacter and methyloversatilis mainly harbored synthesis genes of the costly amino acids tryptophan and phenylalanine these heterotrophs were likely to have an important functional niche in the amino acids metabolism of an p and an c which might be more conducive to efficient microbial interactions through cross feeding between anammox bacteria and heterotrophs 56 it is worth noting that isosphaera was the only bacteria harboring amino acid degradation genes of costly amino acids fig 4b and might have a cooperative relationship with other heterotrophs in the cross feeding process 58 additionally few microorganisms harbored degradation genes of cheaper amino acids the degradation gene of serine was only harbored by pseudomonas while the degradation gene of glycine was possessed by pseudomonas and chloroflexus amino acids or peptides could be degraded into carbon containing intermediates by heterotrophs 16 thus in this study pseudomonas and chloroflexus might provide carbon containing intermediates for other heterotrophs through microbial interactions 3 5 microbial information exchange based on the ahls quorum sensing system ahls based qs systems are important for microbial information exchange in biological nitrogen removal systems 23 59 the relative abundance of ahls related genes and their related genus are shown in fig 5 the synthesis genes of ahls rpal and the sensing genes of ahls rapr were detected in an p and anc indicating that microorganisms might exchange information through the ahls based qs systems the relative abundance of hdts was significantly higher than that of other synthesis genes fig 5a so it might be the most important synthesis genes of ahls in the anammox system which was consistent with tang et al 59 and laue et al 60 additionally acylase could degrade ahls by cleaving amide bonds of ahls 61 the relative abundance of the gene encoding acylase in a nc was slightly higher than that of a np implying that the more complex balance between the ahl qs and ahl quorum quenching qq might exist in a nc in addition the genes related to diffusible signal factor and autoinducers 2 were also detected in the anammox system so microbial information exchange was also likely to occur through these types of qs systems but the specific mechanism needs to be further studied hdts was mainly harbored by candidatus kuenenia which also had the potential to produce ahls fig 5b hyphomicrobium and methylobacterium possessed rpal and hdts so these microorganisms could synthesize ahls through two synthesis pathways rpar was harbored by bradyrhizobium and rhodopseudomonas which could be used to sense ahls thus hyphomicrobium methylobacterium bradyrhizobium and rhodopseudomonas might cooperate to achieve the synthesis and sensing of ahls additionally geobacter burkholderia isosphaera and other heterotrophs also harbored hdts hence ahls qs system was likely to be used for microbial interactions of information exchange between autotrophs and heterotrophs in the anammox system the degradation gene of ahls was possessed by candidatus microthrix gemmatimonas and salinispira which were the main qq genus in the anammox system microbial interactions among these heterotrophs and anammox bacteria might also control the balance of ahls qs and ahls qq in the anammox system to verify the existence of ahls qs in an p and an c the diversity distribution and concentration of ahls were detected fig 5c c8 hsl n butyryl dl homoserine lactone c4 hsl n decanoyl dl homoserine lactone c10 hsl and n dodecanoyl dl homoserine lactone c12 hsl were detected in an p and an c and ahls were mainly concentrated in the eps phase the total concentrations of ahls in the eps phase were 231 9 ng g vss an p and 207 5 ng g vss an c while those in the biomass phase were 128 4 ng g vss an p and 113 7 ng g vss an c fig 5c the regulation mechanism of ahls qs systems showed that after the production of ahls in the biomass phase ahls would diffuse freely and accumulate in the eps phase when ahls accumulated to a significant concentration these signal substances would diffuse into the cell overwhelms export and activate the transcription of the target gene 62 the concentration of c10 hsl was 184 2 ng g vss an p and 166 8 ng g vss an c in the eps phase accounting for 79 4 an p and 80 4 an c of the total concentration of ahls in this phase meanwhile c10 hsl made up of 61 6 an p and 59 3 an c of the total concentration of ahls in the biomass phase therefore c10 hsl was the main ahls in the anammox system fig 5c previous studies also found that c10 hsl existed in anammox based systems which might be beneficial to produce eps and enrich anammox bacteria 17 18 in addition c12 hsl was also an important ahls in an p and an c and the content of c12 hsl in the biomass phase was slightly higher than that of the eps phase tang et al 63 detected c12 hsl and c8 hsl in the anammox system and found that c12 hsl might have a negative effect on the activity of anammox bacteria previous studies have found that some heterotrophs could produce c12 hsl such as pseudomonas sp 1a1 and rhodococcus sp bh4 64 65 this indicated that c12 hsl might be produced by heterotrophs rather than anammox bacteria hence c10 hsl and c12 hsl might play different roles in the anammox system further affecting the enrichment of different types of bacteria 3 6 potential microbial interactions in an p and an c candidatus kuenenia and heterotrophs coexisted in the anammox system fig 6 6 genera harbored genes relating to nitrogen metabolism amino acid metabolism and ahls qs system including 2 genera of autotrophs candidatus kuenenia and ntrosomonas and 4 genera of heterotrophs hyphomicrobium geobacter burkholderia and candidatus accumulibacter these four heterotrophs might affect the performance of nitrogen removal the production of eps and the synthesis or degradation of ahls which were also likely to have an important functional niche in the anammox system nitrogen and carbon metabolisms related genes were not only possessed by anammox bacteria but also harbored by pseudomonas and nitrososipra pseudomonas might have the potential to synthesize or degrade amino acids which could provide amino acids by themselves or other heterotrophs as carbon sources 16 in addition 5 heterotrophs possessed the genes related to both amino acid metabolism and the ahls qs system so cooperative or competitive interactions might exist in the process of the degradation of amino acids and ahls based information exchanges but the possible mechanism needs to be further explored 4 conclusions an p had a stronger stability and perturbation resistance than an c and the pulse feeding pattern was an effective strategy for the application of the anammox process candidatus kuenenia was the dominant functional microorganism and played an important role in the nitrogen conversion and the amino acids metabolism many heterotrophs existed in the anammox system and there were complex interactions between anammox bacteria and heterotrophs by cross feeding and information exchange ahls based qs system c10 hsl and c12 hsl were the main signal substances in this study which might play important roles in microbial interactions declaration of competing interest the authors report no

13703,the objective of this work was to analyze the applicability of advanced oxidative processes aops based on the uv h2o2 catalyst system for the oxidative degradation of tetracycline tc from aqueous solutions tc is a rather stable pharmaceutical compound and the retrieval methods for its effective decomposition are an extremely urgent problem for the wastewater treatment processes during the experiments several possible catalytic systems were investigated it was determined that tio2 anatase and al2o3 are the most active in the tc oxidative degradation using these catalysts allowed to significantly reduce the amount of hydrogen peroxide feed into the oxidation system using tio2 3 times al2o3 4 times compared with the reaction stoichiometry while the degree of tc destruction in both cases was 99 9 it is noted that when using tio2 the oxidation reactions of intermediates occur more slowly despite the greater amount of hydrogen peroxide in the system and the reduction in cod at 360 s of exposure was only 50 at the same time in the system with al2o3 as a catalyst cod decreased by 75 at 360 s of the experiment it was determined that the reactions occurring during catalytic oxidation in the different systems under study attribute to the first and pseudo first order conducted toxicological tests showed that in spite of the complete tc destruction additional sorption treatment is required for their complete neutralization based on the conducted experiments it was concluded that the analyzed methods can be used for water treatment processes keywords tetracycline photocatalysis tio2 al2o3 wastewater treatment 1 introduction wastewater treatment is a complex and topical problem wastewater from residential buildings catering and service enterprises are exposed to the deep biological treatment according to the traditional treatment scheme this scheme includes grating systems and sand traps primary sedimentation nitrification and denitrification secondary sedimentation and filtration before the discharge of treatment water into the surface water it undergoes an obligatory disinfection stage ultraviolet irradiation chlorination 1 the pharmaceutical industry in comparison to the abovementioned examples is a source of insignificant volumes of wastewater however due to the presence of a wide range of chemicals in these wastewaters they cannot be treated by traditional methods and cannot be reused depending on the type of products the wastewater may be contaminated with significant amounts of suspended matter production of solid forms synthetic or natural aliphatic acids production of creams and ointments or have significant concentrations of dissolved organic matters alcohols acids high molecular weight organic compounds 1 3 the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater as well as content regulation of individual components in the wastewater for example penicillin group antibiotics is currently receiving increasing attention in many countries there is no full fledged system for determining the content of various active pharmaceutical ingredients api in wastewater which is why the total hazard of wastewater is estimated by the integral indicator of chemical oxygen demand cod however the cod cannot fully represent the toxicity and hazard of certain substances in the discharged effluent when reaching the municipal wastewater treatment plants such effluents inhibit the activity of activated sludge thereby reducing the overall treatment efficiency leading to the discharge of insufficiently treated wastewater into surface water 4 the essential danger of this wastewater type entering the surface water is the toxic effect of complex organic matters mainly aromatic even in trace amounts taking into account their synthetic nature these matters do not decompose under the influence of environmental factors and are prone to bioaccumulation studies on the long term effects of such pharmaceuticals on living organisms are insufficient 5 considering the fact that the effectiveness of biological treatment of wastewater from pharmaceutical production is quite low up to 10 5 6 the treatment process requires an individual approach to each specific case a separate issue is the wastewater treatment of pharmaceutical production wastewater depending on the output can carry up to 20 25 different api complex organic matters along with auxiliary substances simple organic acids metal oxides etc studies conducted around the world show that wastewater from municipal wastewater treatment plants entering water bodies contains a wide range of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites prevalently antibiotics and various hormonal compounds are found in wastewater the most widespread antibiotics are the ones from tetracycline tc group which are used to fight infections in humans and animals 7 9 various tc derivatives rank second in detection 10 production and consumption according to studies by wang et al 11 tc was detected in surface water samples in a concentration range of 0 07 1 34 ng l according to gu et al 12 a survey of wastewater treatment plants in wisconsin usa showed that tc compounds were present in 80 of the wastewater samples at the inlet and outlet of the wastewater treatment plant which confirms the low efficiency of biological treatment for this pharmaceutical group the treatment of such wastewater is carried out as a rule with the use of oxidative processes complex organic molecules under the action of strong oxidizing agents ozone hypochlorite hydrogen peroxide decompose into components and can be further effectively treated at municipal wastewater treatment plants 13 despite significant advances in the development of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment technologies using oxidative methods the efficiency of destruction of certain pharmaceuticals does not exceed 50 60 14 15 a promising way for the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment is the processes using advanced oxidation processes aops 10 15 20 the main advantage of using aops compared to traditional oxidative processes is the high rate of oxidation the aop s process produces a hydroxyl radical oh which has a significantly higher oxidizing potential than traditional oxidizers for oh is 2 80 for o3 is 2 07 for h2o2 is 1 77 for oh2 is 1 70 and etc 6 depending on the selected oxidant the mechanism of hydroxyl radical formation can vary significantly common aop s are 21 23 6 1 1 treatment with ozone at ph 9 0 10 0 o3 h2o 2oh o2 2 the combined effect of ozone and hydrogen peroxide o3 h2o2 2oh 3o2 3

methods for example to treat difficultly oxidizable substances such as pharmaceuticals dyes or pesticides 24 27 recently the possibility of using titanium compounds in various water treatment processes has been increasingly discussed research teams from russia and china have proven high efficiency of silicon 28 and titanium containing 29 32 reagents in wastewater treatment processes of complex composition the objective of this work was an assessment possibility of treatment model wastewater containing difficultly decomposable tc using photodegradation in presence of h2o2 and different metal oxide based catalysts its comparison between each other possibility of application to the design of efficiency green recyclable method for real wastewater treatment to accomplish the objective we studied kinetics of tc oxidative destruction in different systems different factors such as amount of catalyst or hydrogen peroxide on tc destruction were analyzed a toxicity assessment of the model solution before and after its exposure in the uv h2o2 catalyst system was carried out 2 experimental section 2 1 material and reagents titanium oxide tio2 99 8 anatase and 99 98 rutil powders titanium oxysulfate solution tioso4 хh2o titanium tetrachloride solution 99 9 ticl4 activated aluminum oxide powder alunima al2o3 obtained from sigma aldrich were used as catalysts in order to eliminate the adsorption effect of pharmaceuticals on the catalyst surface the static capacity of the catalysts was determined without additional uv h2o2 irradiation the total adsorption efficiency of pharmaceuticals and intermediates on all reagents did not exceed 10 analytical grade tetracycline hydrochloride was obtained from sigma aldrich for the spectrophotometric determination of tetracycline in water the following solutions obtained from sigma aldrich were used formaldehyde solution 37 wt in h2o ch2o acetylacetone c5h8o2 99 6 ammonium hydroxide solution nh4oh puriss p a sodium meta vanadate navo3 98 sodium hydroxide naoh 98 analytical grade formic ch2o2 and acetic c2h4o2 acids potassium manganate k2mno4 potassium bichromate k2cr2o7 sulfuric acid h2so4 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 were obtained from himreagent deionized water from a milli q system academiс waters millipore was used to prepare all solutions 2 2 irradiation procedures after perusing the literature is was determined that unmodified titanium dioxide is inactive in visible light 33 34 so the experiment was conducted using uv irradiation in a coil photoreactor with an 8 w mercury quartz low pressure drb 8 lamp 61 the minimum irradiation intensity of the uv lamp at a wavelength of 254 nm was 0 025 w cm2 the light power of the drb 8 lamp was 2 1 w the irradiation dose in the experiments varied from 0 79 to 35 42 j cm2 the contact time with irradiation zone τc ranging from 12 to 540 s uv reactor diagram is shown in fig 1 in order to maintain stable uvc output irradiance we warmed up the mercury lamps in advance and controlled the temperature 25 c the laboratory unit includes a mercury quartz lamp 2 a quartz coil 3 a peristaltic pump for infeed of wastewater solution 1 a receiver for treated water collection 4 the lamp is located coaxially with a quartz coil 40 mm in diameter the inner diameter of the quartz tube is 5 mm the lamp and the coil are enclosed in a stainless steel housing the contact time of the liquid with uv irradiation was calculated by the formula 2 1 τ c l d c n c s c s a g l where dс coil diameter 40 mm nc coil number 16 pcs scsa cross sectional area s π r2 quartz

coil radius 20 mm 2 3 analytical procedures the quantitative content of tc is based on reaction with naoh 10 and on determining the resulting compound colored in yellow green color at a wavelength λ 340 nm 35 the quantitative content of formaldehyde and formic acid was determined by the standard spectrophotometric method on a gbc cintra 303 spectrophotometer australia 36 to determine formaldehyde the method based on derivatization of formaldehyde with acetylacetone in ammonium acetate and on determining the resulting compound colored yellow at a wavelength of λ 412 nm was used to determine formic acid the method which is based on reaction of formic acid with ammonium vanadate and determining the resulting compound colored in yellow color at a wavelength λ 400 nm was used the quantitative analysis of h2o2 was performed using the standard titrimetric method proposed in 36 the method is based on its interaction with k2mno4 which oxidizes h2o2 when involved in a chemical reaction the content of the detected api and intermediates was found from calibration curves to draw which working solutions of substances with concentration range from 1 to 50 mg l were prepared cod was determined by arbitration analysis according to the standard method 37 during the experiment the acute toxic effect of the studied solutions was evaluated lower daphnid crustaceans daphnia magna were selected as a test species daphnia magna individuals were collected from beloe lake dmitrov russia and kept according to iso 38 21 c 16 h light 8 h dark period the neonates 24 h old were used in the 96 h acute assay according to the standardized biotest 38 of the inhibition of daphnia magna for final testing the predefined dilution coefficient of two was used and at least three containers for each given dilution ratio 10 animals were selected for each test concentration and 10 animals for the control series separately acute toxicity was expressed by the ec50 value which causes the death of 50 or more of the test species during the exposure time of 24 48 72 and 96 h using the control experiment as a reference with no more than 10 of inhibition measurements were carried out at least three times for each parameter at τc 12 540s 3 results and discussion 3 1 tc photodegradation in the presence of different catalysts due to the high photoactivity of titanium oxide in the crystalline form anatase was taken as a reference point relative to which all the others are compared 39 the most commonly used oxides are tio2 zno and cds halides but maximum permissible concentration for discharging to surface water russian federation norms for zn is 0 01 mg dm3 for cd is 0 005 mg dm3 for s2 is 0 0005 mg dm3 which is significantly lower relative with ti 0 1 mg dm3 in the literature the use of an oxidizing system based on aluminum oxide with h2o2 has shown efficiency in the oxidation of inorganic compounds 40 phenol was oxidized based on wet oxidation reaction using h2o2 and cu 5 al2o3 catalysts 41 novel fenton like catalyst γ cu al2o3 bi12o15cl6 was used for degradation of phenolic compounds 42 bimetallic pd pb catalysts supported on γ al2o3 were used for glycerol oxidation with h2o2 as the oxidizing agent at atmospheric pressure and 45 c 43 highly stable ru pvp γ al2o3 catalyst is used for the h2o2 oxidation of sulfides 44 it was suggested that the use of al2o3 as a catalyst for the oxidation of api tetracycline is promising the maximum permissible concentration for discharging to surface water russian federation norms for al is 0 5 mg dm3 that is why at the first stage of the experiment the tc degradation during photocatalytic oxidation was evaluated using various catalysts based on different titanium containing substances and aluminum oxide fig 2 at uv irradiation time of 180 s fig 2 shows that the introduction of a catalyst into the system significantly increases the efficiency of tc degradation while titanium oxide in the form of anatase and aluminum oxide showed maximum efficiency minimal catalytic activity possessed titanium dioxide in the form of rutile which corresponds to the literature data 22 45 the intermediate effectiveness of titanium salts in the form of chloride or sulfate can be explained by the incompletely formed structure of titanium hydroxide 46 which is formed as a result of the hydrolysis of its salts at neutral ph depending on the precipitation conditions rutile is usually crystallized from hydrochloric acid salts such as titanium hydroxide 47 48 and from sulfate containing hydroxides with properties close to anatase 46 49 50 it should be noted that using titanium compounds as a catalyst in addition to increasing the degree of degradation coagulating properties of titanium salts will occur which significantly increases the treatment efficiency and reduces the reagent costs of the wastewater treatment process also it is possible to recycle oxides as was mentioned in literature data 51 53 to assess the effect of the

concentration in the range from 0 1 to 1 g l data on the efficiency of tc degradation c0 20 mg l depending on the catalyst concentration with the uv irradiation time of 180 s are presented in table 1 from the data of table 1 we can conclude that the reaction most likely proceeds in the first order which is confirmed by an increase in the degree of tc degradation with an increase in the tc initial

photocatalytic degradation based on the obtained data the next stage of research was the assessment of the possibility of reducing the h2o2 dose as well as the effect of irradiation time in uv h2o2

results as a function of irradiation time at different stoichiometric ratio tc h2o2 in uv h2o2 catalyst system based on al2o3 and tio2 when using tio2 or al2o3 at stoichiometric ratios tc h2o2 1 1 experiments showed complete tc degradation in the first seconds from the obtained data we can see that when using tio2 the oxidation efficiency exceeds 99 even at ratios tc h2o2 1 0 33 already at 120

as was determined in previous works 61 the total adsorption efficiency of al2o3 for pharmaceuticals or intermediates did not exceed 10 we can conclude that efficiency of degradation was not less than 90 the efficiency of using aluminum oxide can be explained that γ aluminia is an effective catalyst for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide with the creation of an additional amount of hydroxyl radicals processes using nanoparticles of aluminum oxide hydrogen peroxide and external irradiation was described in work 54 in the case of using titanium oxide the process of creation of hydroxyl radicals under the uv irradiation occurs decomposition of water part of which is spent on the subsequent decomposition of hydrogen peroxide due to it the concentration of reactive oxygen species in water when used as a catalyst of titanium oxide was approximately 1 5 2 0 times lower from the data of fig 4 it can be concluded that the h2o2 tio2 ratio primarily affects the degradation efficiency the irradiation time begins to play a role when there is a lack of h2o2 in the reaction mixture as a result of which the reaction takes place over a longer time interval for the h2o2 al2o3 system an increase in the h2o2 concentration leads to a degradation time reduction the efficiency of tc degradation regardless of the catalyst type was 97 0 99 0 whereas the residual content of h2o2 can be toxic to aquatic biota it seems logical to trace the quantitative change in the h2o2 concentration in the solution during photocatalytic oxidation fig 4 shows that at the initial time point the h2o2 concentration decreases by almost 50 then the reaction rate decreases significantly at 180 s of the experiment no tc was detected in the solution the h2o2 concentration is 23 mg l using tio2 and 7 mg

the chemical transformations that api molecules undergo in the course of oxidative degradation are extremely complex the result of these transformations is the destruction of the benzene rings and functional groups that make up the initial molecules to low molecular weight organic acids and subsequent mineralization to co2 and h2o in fig 5 shows the changes in the tc concentration the integral indicator of cod and the intermediates concentration of the tc oxidation formic acid and formaldehyde as a function of irradiation time comparing the two diagrams it can be seen that an increase in cod occurs at a certain point in time which probably corresponds to the intermediates generation for example in the uv h2o2 tio2 system at the same time about 60 s from the start of the experiment the formic acid concentration increases and in the uv h2o2 al2o3 system after 12 s of the experiment the formaldehyde concentration increases it can be noted that when using tio2 the reactions of intermediates oxidation occur more slowly despite the greater amount of h2o2 in the system after 360 s of uv exposure the cod decreased only by 50 and the concentrations of formic acid and formaldehyde at this exposure time were 27 3 mg l and 4 6 mg l respectively at the same time in the system with al2o3 as a catalyst after 360 s of the experiment cod decreased by 75 formic acid was not found at this irradiation time the formaldehyde concentration was 0 81 mg l based on the obtained data it can be concluded that when using tio2 as a catalyst oxidative degradation proceeds through the formation of intermediates and when using al2o3 as a catalyst there is no such peaks which probably indicates a chain mechanism of organic components degradation to determine the reaction mechanism the nitrogen adsorption isotherms on the surface of the tio2 and al2o3 were obtained by the nova 1200e high speed surface area and pore size analyzer quantachrome united states for these catalysts the static adsorption capacity with respect to formic acid was determined as a result of the experiment it was found that the formic acid adsorption on the surface of the catalysts does not exceed 10 to calculate the rate constants for the tc decomposition during oxidation in the uv h2o2 catalyst system we used the equation for the kinetic model of a pseudo first order reactions the obtained data were compared with the previously conducted results of the tc oxidation in the uv h2o2 system table 2 56 the investigated oxidation processes in the presence of a catalyst as well as without a catalyst can be attributed to first and pseudo first order reactions with a linear correlation l n c τ τ fig 6 experimental data on tc oxidative degradation in uv h2o2 al2o3 system demonstrated first order reactions at the same time tc oxidative degradation in uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 tio2 systems have already demonstrated two stages of pseudo first order a characteristic break in the figure probably the two stage process is associated with the possible reactions between the target substance and the intermediates which are formed in larger quantities during oxidation in uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 tio2 systems fig 6 as can be seen from table 2 with al2o3 introduction into the system the rate constant increases by 4 2 times and with tio2 introduction by 29 3 times for value k1 but only up to 12 s then the oxidation process significantly slows down and value k2 becomes only 1 2 times higher the tc oxidation degree in the uv h2o2 tio2 system reaches 84 5 in the first 12 s of uv exposure based on these data it can be concluded that when al2o3 is used as a catalyst the tc oxidative degree is significantly higher considering the formation of intermediates than when tio2 is used 3 4 toxicity evaluation a perusal of the literature showed that intermediates formation can increase the toxicity of the treated solution 7 8 in this regard during the study additional experiments were conducted to determine the possible toxic effects of intermediates in model solutions lower daphnids crustaceans were taken as a test species which widely used at russian industrial plants for wastewater analysis before water input to biological treatment plants the experiment was carried out according to the standard methods as recommended in iso 38 us epa 57 and oecd 58 59 test guidelines for toxicological assessment of the wastewater acute toxicity or median lethal concentration that causes the death of 50 or more percent of the test species lc50 median lethal concentration was 8 87 ctc 12 mg l the tc harmless concentration c0 20 mg l causing the death of no more than 10 of the test species lc10 lowest lethal concentration in 96 h of exposure was 25 23 ctc 4 mg l and the average value of lethal time lt50 lethal time was 48 h a toxicity assessment of the model solution after its exposure in the uv h2o2 al2o3 system was carried out with the ratio of tc h2o2 1 0 25 and uv irradiation time of 180 360 and 540 s in order to reduce the probability of a static error the experiment was carried out in two parallel runs despite the fact that tc content is absent in the model solution at the exposure time of 180 s the death of test species was 100 at all points and the lt50 was 1 h this is probably due to the presence in the solution of a residual amount of intermediates such as carboxylic acids and aldehydes as well as a high residual hydrogen peroxide concentration to confirm this theory additional experiments were conducted with the introduction to the solution of 1 g l of birch based activated carbon bac with 30 min stirring in order to remove intermediates and hydrogen peroxide residues from model solution 60 the biotesting results are presented in table 3 from the data in table 3 it can be seen that the bac dose in the amount of 1 g l was not enough for the survival rate of 50 or more percent of test species an increase in the initial dose of bac up to 2 g l led to positive results i e the survival rate of test species was more than 50 after 360 s of exposure time 4 conclusions based on the data obtained as a result of experiments it can be concluded that when using the uv h2o2 catalyst system as aop s it is most advisable to use aluminum oxide the use of al2o3 can significantly reduce the content of intermediates in the treated water as well as achieve a significant reduction in the consumption of hydrogen peroxide required for the complete tc oxidative destruction it is established that using al2o3 in photocatalytical process allows to completely destruct the difficultly decomposable pharmaceutical substance in order to reduce the toxic effect of intermediates on activated sludge in deep biological treatment plants the need for subsequent treatment of model solutions for example adsorption from the tc decomposition products has been proven according preliminary estimation the cost of using of al2o3 as catalyst will be 3 4 times less than when using tio2 as a catalyst at the same time due to the more complete oxidation reaction using al2o3 and lower maximum permissible concentration the prevented damage and penalties for the discharge of insufficiently treated effluents in russian federation will be 2 3 times lower declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors express their gratitude to the

13703,the objective of this work was to analyze the applicability of advanced oxidative processes aops based on the uv h2o2 catalyst system for the oxidative degradation of tetracycline tc from aqueous solutions tc is a rather stable pharmaceutical compound and the retrieval methods for its effective decomposition are an extremely urgent problem for the wastewater treatment processes during the experiments several possible catalytic systems were investigated it was determined that tio2 anatase and al2o3 are the most active in the tc oxidative degradation using these catalysts allowed to significantly reduce the amount of hydrogen peroxide feed into the oxidation system using tio2 3 times al2o3 4 times compared with the reaction stoichiometry while the degree of tc destruction in both cases was 99 9 it is noted that when using tio2 the oxidation reactions of intermediates occur more slowly despite the greater amount of hydrogen peroxide in the system and the reduction in cod at 360 s of exposure was only 50 at the same time in the system with al2o3 as a catalyst cod decreased by 75 at 360 s of the experiment it was determined that the reactions occurring during catalytic oxidation in the different systems under study attribute to the first and pseudo first order conducted toxicological tests showed that in spite of the complete tc destruction additional sorption treatment is required for their complete neutralization based on the conducted experiments it was concluded that the analyzed methods can be used for water treatment processes keywords tetracycline photocatalysis tio2 al2o3 wastewater treatment 1 introduction wastewater treatment is a complex and topical problem wastewater from residential buildings catering and service enterprises are exposed to the deep biological treatment according to the traditional treatment scheme this scheme includes grating systems and sand traps primary sedimentation nitrification and denitrification secondary sedimentation and filtration before the discharge of treatment water into the surface water it undergoes an obligatory disinfection stage ultraviolet irradiation chlorination 1 the pharmaceutical industry in comparison to the abovementioned examples is a source of insignificant volumes of wastewater however due to the presence of a wide range of chemicals in these wastewaters they cannot be treated by traditional methods and cannot be reused depending on the type of products the wastewater may be contaminated with significant amounts of suspended matter production of solid forms synthetic or natural aliphatic acids production of creams and ointments or have significant concentrations of dissolved organic matters alcohols acids high molecular weight organic compounds 1 3 the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater as well as content regulation of individual components in the wastewater for example penicillin group antibiotics is currently receiving increasing attention in many countries there is no full fledged system for determining the content of various active pharmaceutical ingredients api in wastewater which is why the total hazard of wastewater is estimated by the integral indicator of chemical oxygen demand cod however the cod cannot fully represent the toxicity and hazard of certain substances in the discharged effluent when reaching the municipal wastewater treatment plants such effluents inhibit the activity of activated sludge thereby reducing the overall treatment efficiency leading to the discharge of insufficiently treated wastewater into surface water 4 the essential danger of this wastewater type entering the surface water is the toxic effect of complex organic matters mainly aromatic even in trace amounts taking into account their synthetic nature these matters do not decompose under the influence of environmental factors and are prone to bioaccumulation studies on the long term effects of such pharmaceuticals on living organisms are insufficient 5 considering the fact that the effectiveness of biological treatment of wastewater from pharmaceutical production is quite low up to 10 5 6 the treatment process requires an individual approach to each specific case a separate issue is the wastewater treatment of pharmaceutical production wastewater depending on the output can carry up to 20 25 different api complex organic matters along with auxiliary substances simple organic acids metal oxides etc studies conducted around the world show that wastewater from municipal wastewater treatment plants entering water bodies contains a wide range of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites prevalently antibiotics and various hormonal compounds are found in wastewater the most widespread antibiotics are the ones from tetracycline tc group which are used to fight infections in humans and animals 7 9 various tc derivatives rank second in detection 10 production and consumption according to studies by wang et al 11 tc was detected in surface water samples in a concentration range of 0 07 1 34 ng l according to gu et al 12 a survey of wastewater treatment plants in wisconsin usa showed that tc compounds were present in 80 of the wastewater samples at the inlet and outlet of the wastewater treatment plant which confirms the low efficiency of biological treatment for this pharmaceutical group the treatment of such wastewater is carried out as a rule with the use of oxidative processes complex organic molecules under the action of strong oxidizing agents ozone hypochlorite hydrogen peroxide decompose into components and can be further effectively treated at municipal wastewater treatment plants 13 despite significant advances in the development of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment technologies using oxidative methods the efficiency of destruction of certain pharmaceuticals does not exceed 50 60 14 15 a promising way for the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment is the processes using advanced oxidation processes aops 10 15 20 the main advantage of using aops compared to traditional oxidative processes is the high rate of oxidation the aop s process produces a hydroxyl radical oh which has a significantly higher oxidizing potential than traditional oxidizers for oh is 2 80 for o3 is 2 07 for h2o2 is 1 77 for oh2 is 1 70 and etc 6 depending on the selected oxidant the mechanism of hydroxyl radical formation can vary significantly common aop s are 21 23 6 1 1 treatment with ozone at ph 9 0 10 0 o3 h2o 2oh o2 2 the combined effect of ozone and hydrogen peroxide o3 h2o2 2oh 3o2 3

processes has been increasingly discussed research teams from russia and china have proven high efficiency of silicon 28 and titanium containing 29 32 reagents in wastewater treatment processes of complex composition the objective of this work was an assessment possibility of treatment model wastewater containing difficultly decomposable tc using photodegradation in presence of h2o2 and different metal oxide based catalysts its comparison between each other possibility of application to the design of efficiency green recyclable method for real wastewater treatment to accomplish the objective we studied kinetics of tc oxidative destruction in different systems different factors such as amount of catalyst or hydrogen peroxide on tc destruction were analyzed a toxicity assessment of the model solution before and after its exposure in the uv h2o2 catalyst system was carried out 2 experimental section 2 1 material and reagents titanium oxide tio2 99 8 anatase and 99 98 rutil powders titanium oxysulfate solution tioso4 хh2o titanium tetrachloride solution 99 9 ticl4 activated aluminum oxide powder alunima al2o3 obtained from sigma aldrich were used as catalysts in order to eliminate the adsorption effect of pharmaceuticals on the catalyst surface the static capacity of the catalysts was determined without additional uv h2o2 irradiation the total adsorption efficiency of pharmaceuticals and intermediates on all reagents did not exceed 10 analytical grade tetracycline hydrochloride was obtained from sigma aldrich for the spectrophotometric determination of tetracycline

obtained from himreagent deionized water from a milli q system academiс waters millipore was used to prepare all solutions 2 2 irradiation procedures after perusing the literature is was determined that unmodified titanium dioxide is inactive in visible light 33 34 so the experiment was conducted using uv irradiation in a coil photoreactor with an 8 w mercury quartz low pressure drb 8 lamp 61 the minimum irradiation intensity of the uv lamp at a wavelength of 254 nm was 0 025 w cm2 the light power of the drb 8 lamp was 2 1 w the irradiation dose in the experiments varied from 0 79 to 35 42 j cm2 the contact time with irradiation zone τc ranging from 12 to 540 s uv reactor diagram is shown in fig 1 in order to maintain stable uvc output irradiance we warmed up the mercury lamps in

coil radius 20 mm 2 3 analytical procedures the quantitative content of tc is based on reaction with naoh 10 and on determining the resulting compound colored in yellow green color at a wavelength λ 340 nm 35 the quantitative content of formaldehyde and formic acid was determined by the standard spectrophotometric method on a gbc cintra 303 spectrophotometer australia 36 to determine formaldehyde the method based on derivatization of formaldehyde with acetylacetone in ammonium acetate and on determining the resulting compound colored yellow at a wavelength of λ 412 nm was used to determine formic acid the method which is based on reaction of formic acid with ammonium vanadate and determining the resulting compound colored in yellow color at a wavelength λ 400 nm was used the quantitative analysis of h2o2 was performed using the standard titrimetric method proposed in 36 the method is based on its interaction with k2mno4 which oxidizes h2o2 when involved in a chemical reaction the content of the detected api and intermediates was found from calibration curves to draw which working solutions of substances with concentration range from 1 to 50 mg l were prepared cod was determined by arbitration analysis according to the standard method 37 during the experiment the acute toxic effect of the studied solutions was evaluated lower daphnid crustaceans daphnia magna were selected as a test species daphnia magna individuals were collected from beloe lake dmitrov russia and kept according to iso 38 21 c 16 h light 8 h dark period the neonates 24 h old were used in the 96 h acute assay according to the standardized biotest 38 of the inhibition of daphnia magna for final testing the predefined dilution coefficient of two was used and at least three containers for each given dilution ratio 10 animals were selected for each test concentration and 10 animals for the control series separately acute toxicity was expressed by the ec50 value which causes the death of 50 or more of the test species during the exposure time of 24 48 72 and 96 h using the control experiment as a reference with no more than 10 of inhibition measurements were carried out at least three times for each parameter at τc 12 540s 3 results and discussion 3 1 tc photodegradation in the presence of different catalysts due to the high photoactivity of titanium oxide in the crystalline form anatase was taken as a reference point relative to which all the others are compared 39 the most commonly used oxides are tio2 zno and cds halides but maximum permissible concentration for discharging to surface water russian federation norms for zn is 0 01 mg dm3 for cd is 0 005 mg dm3 for s2 is 0 0005 mg dm3 which is significantly lower relative with ti 0 1 mg dm3 in the literature the use of an oxidizing system based on aluminum oxide with h2o2 has shown efficiency in the oxidation of inorganic compounds 40 phenol was oxidized based on wet oxidation reaction using h2o2 and cu 5 al2o3 catalysts 41 novel fenton like catalyst γ cu al2o3 bi12o15cl6 was used for degradation of phenolic compounds 42 bimetallic pd pb catalysts supported on γ al2o3 were used for glycerol oxidation with h2o2 as the oxidizing agent at atmospheric pressure and 45 c 43 highly stable ru pvp γ al2o3 catalyst is used for the h2o2 oxidation of sulfides 44 it was suggested that the use of al2o3 as a catalyst for the oxidation of api tetracycline is promising the maximum permissible concentration for discharging to surface water russian federation norms for al is 0 5 mg dm3 that is why at the first stage of the experiment the tc degradation during photocatalytic oxidation was evaluated using various catalysts based on different titanium containing substances and aluminum oxide fig 2 at uv irradiation time of 180 s fig 2 shows that the introduction of a catalyst into the system significantly increases the efficiency of tc degradation while titanium oxide in the form of anatase and aluminum oxide showed maximum efficiency minimal catalytic activity possessed titanium dioxide in the form of rutile which corresponds to the literature data 22 45 the intermediate effectiveness of titanium salts in the form of chloride or sulfate can be explained by the incompletely formed structure of titanium hydroxide 46 which is formed as a result of the hydrolysis of its salts at neutral ph depending on the precipitation conditions rutile is usually crystallized from hydrochloric acid salts such as titanium hydroxide 47 48 and from sulfate containing hydroxides with properties close to anatase 46 49 50 it should be noted that using titanium compounds as a catalyst in addition to increasing the degree of degradation coagulating properties of titanium salts will occur which significantly increases the treatment efficiency and reduces the reagent costs of the wastewater treatment process also it is possible to recycle oxides as was mentioned in literature data 51 53 to assess the effect of the catalyst initial concentration on the efficiency of degradation on the best catalyst samples tio2 anatase and al2o3 a repeated experiment was conducted with a change in the catalyst initial

1 g l of birch based activated carbon bac with 30 min stirring in order to remove intermediates and hydrogen peroxide residues from model solution 60 the biotesting results are presented in table 3 from the data in table 3 it can be seen that the bac dose in the amount of 1 g l was not enough for the survival rate of 50 or more percent of test species an increase in the initial dose of bac up to 2 g l led to positive results i e the survival rate of test species was more than 50 after 360 s of exposure time 4 conclusions based on the data obtained as a result of experiments it can be concluded that when using the uv h2o2 catalyst system as aop s it is most advisable to use aluminum oxide the use of al2o3 can significantly reduce the content of intermediates in the treated water as well as achieve a significant reduction in the consumption of hydrogen peroxide required for the complete tc oxidative destruction it is established that using al2o3 in photocatalytical process allows to completely destruct the difficultly decomposable pharmaceutical substance in order to reduce the toxic effect of intermediates on activated sludge in deep biological treatment plants the need for subsequent treatment of model solutions for example adsorption from the tc decomposition products has been proven according preliminary estimation the cost of using of al2o3 as catalyst will be 3 4 times less than when using tio2 as a catalyst at the same time due to the more complete oxidation reaction using al2o3 and lower maximum permissible concentration the prevented damage and penalties for the discharge of insufficiently treated effluents in russian federation will be 2 3 times lower declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors express their gratitude to the

hydrolysis struvite 1 introduction sewage sludge production increases every year and sludge treatment and disposal is a problem representing about 50 of the current operating cost of a sewage treatment plant significant portion of nutrient in human food chain is finally discharged as sewage and it had been reported that 80 90 of p and a significant part of n in the food are ended up in sewage treatment system 1 in case of advanced sewage treatment plant more than 90 of p in sewage is accumulated in sludge therefore sewage sludge is regarded as a nutrient resource since it contains 10 17 of n and 2 3 of p 2 p is an essential non renewable and one of the limiting nutrients of all living organisms p rock reservoir is estimated to be exhausted within 100 years therefore it has driven focus on p recovery from sewage 3 4 currently struvite crystallization from wastewater has drawn much interests since it is one of the most promising simultaneous p and n recovery technologies

sewage therefore cheaper p source is necessary and ssa from the incineration of sewage sludge is one of the alternative p source since it contains high p content 10 9 ssa can replace vulnerable p rock reservoir which has been consumed over one million ton p yearly for fertilizer production 10 to our best knowledge no study has yet been reported to provide p and n for struvite crystallization using

4 g sludge cake dry mass basis was suspended in 100 ml of distilled water at ph 9 0 12 0 with 5 n naoh for 2 h at room temperature samples were taken at 10 30 60 120 min intervals and filtered using

sludge was centrifuged at 6000 g for 10 min mega 17r hanil science industry korea the supernatant was directly used for struvite crystallization because high concentration of suspended solids can interfere struvite crystallization 14 2 2 ssa and p leaching the ssa used in this experiment was a fly ash collected from a municipal sewage sludge incineration plant in pocheon city korea after drying the ssa overnight at 105 c in an oven it was treated with hcl solid liquid ratio of 1 10 for 1 h at ph 4 0 0 1 to selectively remove ca from the ssa 9 after discarding the supernatant the residual solid was further treated with 1 n naoh for 1 h to selectively leach out p and exclude heavy metals by forming insoluble metal hydroxides for the treatment 100 g of residual ssa was mixed with 1 l naoh 1 n solution at the solid liquid ratio s l of 1 10 in a magnetic stirrer the eluted liquid was separated by centrifugation at 6000 g for 10 min mega 17r hanil science industry korea and the supernatant was used as a p source for struvite crystallization detailed p extraction method from ssa can be found elsewhere 9 2 3 struvite precipitation of the sludge hydrolysate and the ssa leachate n and p molar ratio of the alkaline sludge hydrolysate showed that molar nh4 n concentration was about 2 66 times higher than that of po4 3 p in this study additional po4 3 p supply is needed to fully recover nh4 n as struvite from the sludge hydrolysate in this study the required po4 3 p was supplied from the p rich leachate of ssa in which 6 8 g of po4 3 p l 7 4 g of t p l was existed in the ssa leachate mg2 was provided to the nh4 n and po4 3 p solution by dissolving mgcl2 6h2o in distilled water for struvite precipitation nh4 n po4 3 p mg2 were adjusted to 1 1 1 mol ratio in the mixed solution at ph 10 0 by adding 5 n naoh or 5 n hcl 15 the mixed solution was stirred for 20 min at 25 c after mixing the solution was at stand still for 60 min to achieve enough struvite

average values were used for the data interpretation 2 4 2 characterization of the recovered precipitates after struvite precipitation the precipitated product was collected from the filtrate and it was carefully dried in an oven at 40 c to prevent the water loss from crystals and n loss from struvite crystals in order to avoid the formation of bobierrite mg3 po4 2 8h2o newberyite mghpo4 3h2o

to measure the major elements al fe ca mg k na p nh4 n content in the precipitate was calculated as the difference between the initial nh4 n present in the solution and the remaining nh4 n in the filtrate after struvite precipitation nh4 n content in the precipitates could be applied for the purity of struvite because nh4 n is only precipitated as in struvite while po4 3 p and mg2 can be precipitated in other forms therefore purity of struvite could be calculated by following eq 2 by hao et al 21 2 s t r u v i t e c o n t e n t c o n t e n t n x m s t r u v i t e m p x 1000 x 100

means of the solubility of p compounds in 2 citric acid in which 1 g of the recovered product was dissolved in 100 ml of 2 citric acid stirred at 35 40 rpm for 30 min 22 the obtained supernatant was filtered for t p analysis to be compared with the t p obtained from nitric acid digestion method all the experiments were carried out in duplicates n 2 and the average values were used for the analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 n and p extraction from sewage sludge and ssa characterization of the sludge showed that it had t p and t n of 23 1 0 1 and 139 3 18 4 g kg respectively table 1 the sludge 4 w v was hydrolyzed with naoh to investigate alkaline ph effect on the solubilization of p and n compounds from the sludge 23 solubilized t p po4 3 p t n nh4 n and cod were measured and expressed as the percentage of the compounds in the sludge the effect of ph on the release of p compounds t p and po4 3 p n compounds t n and nh4 n and cod from the alkaline sludge hydrolysis were shown in fig 1 solubilization of t p reached 31 4 at ph 9 0 and increased to 39 7 44 8 and 60 6 at ph 10 0 11 0 and 12 0 respectively solubilization efficiencies of po4 3 p based on t p of the sludge were 24 9 35 1 38 3 and 44 6 at ph 9 0 10 0 11 0 and 12 0 respectively cod solubilization efficiencies reached 23 5 25 1 34 and 43 2 at ph 9 0 10 0 11 0 and 12 0 respectively solubilization of t p po4 3 p and cod became double when ph increased from 9 0 12 0 proteins and carbohydrates are the main components of the sludge at high ph condition proteins and carbohydrates are dissociated and negatively charged consequently the solubility of proteins and carbohydrates increased by the repulsion between the negatively charged ions 24 kim et al also reported that the sludge dissolution by naoh treatment was mainly caused by protein denaturation and ionization 23 sludge solubilization based on t n were 33 6 33 3 38 5 and 44 8 at ph 9 0 10 0 11 0 and 12 0 respectively among the ph range the highest solubilization was achieved at ph 12 0 it has been reported that sludge flocs broke at mild alkaline condition and bacterial cell walls broke when ph reached 11 0 25 meanwhile only 8 5 of t n in the sludge was hydrolyzed to nh4 n at ph 12 0 major part of n compounds in sludge still exists as organic n such as proteins peptides and amino acids after alkali treatment it might also be caused by the fact that nh4 n can shift to nh3 g and volatilize from the solution at high ph condition 12 26 bi et al also observed stable trend of nh4 n at different ph during the alkaline treatment of the sludge 12 slightly decreased nh4 n was found at higher ph during the alkaline hydrolysis of the sludge and it was explained that the toxicity of stronger alkaline conditions could decrease the activities of sludge hydrolytic enzymes such as protease and peptidase 24 overall the solubilization of the sludge components were positively associated with time and the hydrolysis rates were very fast during the initial 10 min regardless of the ph conditions but reached a plateau after 30 min data not shown a previous study has shown that the rate of sludge hydrolysis was fast within the initial 30 min and became slower later 27 in this study the sludge was hydrolyzed for 60 min and used for further experiment of struvite crystallization after the alkaline sludge treatment for 60 min t p po4 3 p t n nh4 n and cod in the supernatant were 0 56 0 40 2 50 0 48 and 19 36 g l respectively table 2 t n and nh4 n concentrations in the solution were higher than t p and po4 3 p and the molar ratio of nh4 n po4 3 p was 2 66 1 34 3 mmol l 480 4 mg l of nh4 n and 12 9 mmol l 399 6 mg l po4 3 p in alkaline hydrolyzed sludge solution higher nh4 n molar concentration needed additional po4 3 p supply to completely utilize nh4 n for struvite production supplementary po4 3 p was provided from the p rich ssa in this study sewage sludge and ssa were used as complementary n and p source for struvite production elemental analysis of ssa by icp oes after nitric acid digestion showed that al 11 0 p 10 0 ca 7 7 and fe 3 4 were the major elements followed by mg k na and heavy metals table 3 ca and heavy metals need to be removed from the ssa in order to recover p as struvite and to meet the guidelines of fertilizer therefore sequential acid and alkali treatment of ssa was conducted to achieve p rich solution selectively removing ca and heavy metals 9 sequential acid and alkali treatment leached 74 1 g t p 73 8 of t p from ssa and 67 9 g po4 3 p 67 7 of t p from ssa from kg ssa heavy metals content in the leachate was very low and below the guideline cr and pb were below the detection limit by icp oes table 4 3 2 recovery of n and p by struvite precipitation 3 2 1 chemical and biological characteristics of the recovered product composition of the elements and heavy metals in the recovered precipitate is shown in table 5 po4 3 p and nh4 n were calculated from the result of wet chemical analysis the amount of recovered precipitate was 8 g and the recovered po4 3 p and nh4 n in the precipitate were 1 000 2 and 422 5 mg respectively therefore 125 mg po4 3 p and 52 8 mg nh4 n were contained in a gram g recovered in the precipitate the composition of the harvested precipitate showed po4 3 p 12 5 nh4 n 5 3 and mg2 9 3 and compared with the theoretical value of struvite table 6 the elemental composition of the recovered struvite depends on different kinds of waste sources ranging from 10 1 to 12 65 of p 28 29 the struvite composition obtained from this study was slightly higher than the report of liu et al in which the composition was p 11 5 n 4 97 and mg 9 45 30 po4 3 p nh4 n mg2 molar ratio of the obtained precipitate was 1 07 1 00 1 02 which was close to the theoretical ratio of struvite 1 1 1 therefore it was thought that the precipitate mostly consisted of struvite however the precipitate had slightly higher molar ratio of po4 3 p and mg2 than nh4 n implying the presence of mg p compounds in the precipitate struvite content in the precipitate could be estimated by the nh4 n content in the precipitate because nh4 n rarely forms precipitate other than struvite in this experimental condition 21 from the analysis the recovered precipitate of this study had 92 6 struvite content suzuki et al obtained similar struvite content 95 from swine wastewater 31 for the analysis of p bioavailability of the precipitates the harvested product was analyzed by 2 citric acid method 32 the recovered product showed 91 2 of p bioavailability similar p bioavailability 94 could be found in the studies of melia et al 33 and xu et al 22 while extractable p from struvite reagent by neutral ammonium citrate method was 96 2 in the study of vaneeckhaute et al 34 the result indicated that the recovered product from the sludge and ssa had a sufficient bioavailability and an efficacy as a p fertilizer heavy metals content of the recovered precipitate was also investigated to determine the possibility of using the precipitate as a fertilizer the results showed that heavy metals content was much lower than the fertilizer guideline limit table 5 it implied that the recovered product had a negligible environmental risk and could be directly used as a fertilizer therefore n and p compounds were successfully recovered as struvite and fertilizing property is comparable with other commercial fertilizers even though the sludge and ssa contain complex compounds including heavy metals 3 2 2 spectroscopic analysis of the recovered precipitate the xrd patterns of the harvested product and the database peaks of reference struvite were compared fig 2 the patterns were matched well with the unique pattern of the reference struvite at the 2 theta peaks of 15 04 15 85 16 5 20 91 21 50 27 13 30 6 31 97 and 33 29 35 it proved the formation of struvite crystal atr ftir absorption bands of po4 3 511 1010 1083 cm 1 nh4 2854 2925 cm 1 mg2 461 683 cm 1 and vibration resulting from oh and nh elongation 3240 to 3529 cm 1 were observed in fig 3 36 atr ftir spectrum could show the other co precipitated compounds during the struvite crystallization originpro version 8 0 0 was used for the phosphate vibration modes occurring at the range of 700 1200 cm 1 by comparing with the result of vogel et al 37 and bekiaris et al 38 table 7 the peaks for calcium phosphate dibasic amorphous cahpo4 magnesium phosphate mg3 po4 2 and brushite cahpo4 2h2o were observed at 1044 0 984 9 and 894 1 cm 1 respectively fig 4 it seemed that high ph condition of this study might favor the co precipitation of mg p and ca p 39 meanwhile the peaks occurred at 753 7 and 1079 1 cm 1 were the struvite peaks according to bekiaris et al 38 as a result the solid struvite was probably existed with the amorphous cahpo4 mg3 po4 2 and cahpo4 2h2o in this experiment 3 3 mass balance analysis n and p mass balance analysis were performed for the recovery process from the sludge and ssa to the recovered product fig 5 when the sewage sludge 139 3 g t n kg sludge was hydrolyzed only 8 5 of t n was released into the solution as nh4 n 11 9 g nh4 n kg was for struvite precipitation 40 g of the sludge cake was suspended in 1 l solution therefore the amount of nh4 n was 480 mg l 34 3 mmol of nh4 n l after struvite precipitation 422 5 mg was participated in struvite precipitation therefore 88 0 of nh4 n could be recovered in the precipitate from the hydrolyzed sludge solution however only 7 6 of t n in the sludge cake was recovered as struvite due to its low hydrolysis efficiency as nh4 n it is the bottleneck of n recovery from the sludge and needs to increase the conversion of t n in the sludge into nh4 n in order to enhance struvite yield in the original ssa the amount of t p was 100 3 g kg ssa after leaching procedure 67 7 of po4 3 p 67 9 g po4 3 p kg ssa could be leached out into the solution as l s ratio of 10 was used the amount of po4 3 p released was 6790 mg l in order to avoid overuse of po4 3 p from the ssa leached solution it was needed to check the containing po4 3 p concentration in the sludge solution in the 40 g of sludge the t p present in the sludge was 924 mg table 1 after hydrolysis 412 mg 13 3 mmol po4 3 p l of hydrolyzed sludge solution of po4 3 p was hydrolyzed into the solution table 2 for struvite precipitation po4 3 p was also needed to be 34 3 mmol l as nh4 n therefore another 21 0 mmol 651 mg po4 3 p was required from the ssa solution in total 1063 mg of po4 3 p was provided to the combined solution after struvite crystallization 1 000 2 mg of po4 3 p was recovered in the precipitates therefore 94 1 of the po4 3 p was successfully recovered from the combined solution however as all of the po4 3 p could not reached into solution from the sludge cake and ssa during hydrolysis and leaching procedure respectively the overall p recovery efficiency was 53 9 as po4 3 p considering much lower nh4 n recovery efficiency from the sludge than that of po4 3 p from ssa further research is needed to increase t n conversion to nh4 n during the sludge hydrolysis for economical struvite production 3 4 practical application of nutrient recovery from sewage sludge as struvite treating the waste sludge to meet with the emission guideline is a burden for wastewater treatment plant due to high operating cost however in this study waste sludge could be remanufactured as struvite 49 3 g of waste sludge 40 g of was and 9 3 g of ssa were successfully transformed into 7 4 g of value added product struvite 8 g precipitate with struvite content of 92 6 therefore it was the conversion of 15 of the total mass of sludge waste into valuable fertilizer in addition as all the required p and n for this struvite production was completely obtained from sludge waste any outcome for regent p and n could be avoided moreover high struivte content of the obtained product could make sure the harvested product to achieve the high market selling price therefore this study showed the practical application potential for both wastewater industry and fertilizer industry 4 conclusions this study showed that a single source of sludge could support the required p and n for struvite precipitation by applying two different pretreatment methods alkaline hydrolysis at ph 12 0 released nh4 n and po4 3 p nh4 n po4 3 p 1 2 66 in the sludge supernatant the additional p could be obtained from ssa after acid pretreated alkaline leaching method combination of the hydrolysate of sewage sludge and the leachate of ssa successfully recovered n and p as struvite with recovery of nh4 n 88 0 and po4 3 p 94 1 the similarity of elemental composition was high between obtained product and theoretical struvite moreover it had high struvite content 92 6 high p bioavailability 91 2 and a very low level of heavy metals therefore this studied struvite production pathway could be a promising way to reduce the economic barrier of struvite production meanwhile a scale up of this struvite production strategy is warranted declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

with 1 l naoh 1 n solution at the solid liquid ratio s l of 1 10 in a magnetic stirrer the eluted liquid was separated by centrifugation at 6000 g for 10 min mega 17r hanil science industry korea and the supernatant was used as a p source for struvite crystallization detailed p extraction method from ssa can be found elsewhere 9 2 3 struvite precipitation of the sludge hydrolysate and the ssa leachate n and p molar ratio of the alkaline sludge hydrolysate showed that molar nh4 n concentration was about 2 66 times higher than that of po4 3 p in this study additional po4 3 p supply is needed to fully recover nh4 n as struvite from the sludge hydrolysate in this study the required po4 3 p was supplied from the p rich leachate of ssa in which 6 8 g of po4 3 p l 7 4 g of t p l was existed in the ssa leachate mg2 was provided to the nh4 n and po4 3 p solution by dissolving mgcl2 6h2o in distilled water for struvite precipitation nh4 n po4 3 p mg2 were adjusted to 1 1 1 mol ratio in the mixed solution at ph 10 0 by adding 5 n naoh or 5 n hcl 15 the mixed solution was stirred for 20 min at 25 c after mixing the solution was at stand still for 60 min to achieve enough struvite formation at equilibrium 16 after filtration of the solution the precipitate was washed three times with distilled water and dried to remove nacl impurity 17 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1

on the nitric acid digestion method ds259 19 briefly 1 g of raw ssa was mixed with 20 ml of 7 n hno3 and autoclaved at 121 c for 30 min 19 all the analysis were performed in duplicates n 2 and the average values were used for the data interpretation 2 4 2 characterization of the recovered precipitates after struvite precipitation the precipitated product was collected from the filtrate and it was carefully dried in an oven at 40 c to prevent the water loss from crystals and n loss from struvite crystals in order to avoid the formation of bobierrite mg3 po4 2 8h2o newberyite mghpo4 3h2o magnesium pyrophosphate mg2p2o7 20 then they were gently pulverized in a mortar mill using an agate grinding set cg 600 m 050 c giese germany before xrd analysis d max 2500 v rigaku japan and ftir frontier perkinelmer uk elemental contents po4 3 p nh4 n and mg2 in the precipitate was used for the comparison between the molar composition of the recovered product and the standard struvite they were analyzed by digesting 1 g obtained product in 20 ml of 7 n hno3 and autoclaved at 121 c for 30 min 19 the digestion solution was filtered and analyzed by icp oes optima 7300 dv perkin elmer usa to measure the major elements al fe ca mg k na p nh4 n content in the precipitate was calculated as the difference between the initial nh4 n present in the solution and the remaining nh4 n in the filtrate after struvite precipitation nh4 n content in the precipitates could be applied for the purity of struvite because nh4 n is only precipitated as in struvite while po4 3 p and mg2 can be precipitated in other forms therefore purity of struvite could be calculated by following eq 2 by hao et al 21 2 s t r u v i t e c o n t e n t c o n t e n t n x m s t r u v i t e m p x 1000 x 100

should be lower than the fertilizer limit and icp oes was used for the analysis after nitric acid 7 n digestion p bioavailability is one of the indicators of agricultural fertilizer performance by means of the solubility of p compounds in 2 citric acid in which 1 g of the recovered product was dissolved in 100 ml of 2 citric acid stirred at 35 40 rpm for 30 min 22 the obtained supernatant was filtered for t p analysis to be compared with the t p obtained from nitric acid digestion method all the experiments were carried out in duplicates n 2 and the average values were used for the analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 n and p extraction from sewage sludge and ssa characterization of the sludge showed that it had t p and t n of 23 1 0 1 and 139 3 18 4 g kg respectively table 1 the sludge 4 w v was hydrolyzed with naoh to investigate alkaline ph effect on the solubilization of p and n compounds from the sludge 23 solubilized t p po4 3 p t n nh4 n and cod were measured and expressed as the percentage of the compounds in the sludge the effect of ph on the release of p compounds t p and po4 3 p n compounds t n and nh4 n and cod from the alkaline sludge hydrolysis were shown in fig 1 solubilization of t p reached 31 4 at ph 9 0 and increased to 39 7 44 8 and 60 6 at ph 10 0 11 0 and 12 0 respectively solubilization efficiencies of po4 3 p based on t p of the sludge were 24 9 35 1 38 3 and 44 6 at ph 9 0 10 0 11 0 and 12 0 respectively cod solubilization efficiencies reached 23 5 25 1 34 and 43 2 at ph 9 0 10 0 11 0 and 12 0 respectively solubilization of t p po4 3 p and cod became double when ph increased from 9 0 12 0 proteins and carbohydrates are the main components of the sludge at high ph condition proteins and carbohydrates are dissociated and negatively charged consequently the solubility of proteins and carbohydrates increased by the repulsion between the negatively charged ions 24 kim et al also reported that the sludge dissolution by naoh treatment was mainly caused by protein denaturation and ionization 23 sludge solubilization based on t n were 33 6 33 3 38 5 and 44 8 at ph 9 0 10 0 11 0 and 12 0 respectively among the ph range the highest solubilization was achieved at ph 12 0 it has been reported that sludge flocs broke at mild alkaline condition and bacterial cell walls broke when ph reached 11 0 25 meanwhile only 8 5 of t n in the sludge was hydrolyzed to nh4 n at ph 12 0 major part of n compounds in sludge still exists as organic n such as proteins peptides and amino acids after alkali treatment it might also be caused by the fact that nh4 n can shift to nh3 g and volatilize from the solution at high ph condition 12 26 bi et al also observed stable trend of nh4 n at different ph during the alkaline treatment of the sludge 12 slightly decreased nh4 n was found at higher ph during the alkaline hydrolysis of the sludge and it was explained that the toxicity of stronger alkaline conditions could decrease the activities of sludge hydrolytic enzymes such as protease and peptidase 24 overall the solubilization of the sludge components were positively associated with time and the hydrolysis rates were very fast during the initial 10 min regardless of the ph conditions but reached a plateau after 30 min data not shown a previous study has shown that the rate of sludge hydrolysis was fast within the initial 30 min and became slower later 27 in this study the sludge was hydrolyzed for 60 min and used for further experiment of struvite crystallization after the alkaline sludge treatment for 60 min t p po4 3 p t n nh4 n and cod in the supernatant were 0 56 0 40 2 50 0 48 and 19 36 g l respectively table 2 t n and nh4 n concentrations in the solution were higher than t p and po4 3 p and the molar ratio of nh4 n po4 3 p was 2 66 1 34 3 mmol l 480 4 mg l of nh4 n and 12 9 mmol l 399 6 mg l po4 3 p in alkaline hydrolyzed sludge solution higher nh4 n molar concentration needed additional po4 3 p supply to completely utilize nh4 n for struvite production supplementary po4 3 p was provided from the p rich ssa in this study sewage sludge and ssa were used as complementary n and p source for struvite production elemental analysis of ssa by icp oes after nitric acid digestion showed that al 11 0 p 10 0 ca 7 7 and fe 3 4 were the major elements followed by mg k na and heavy metals table 3 ca and heavy metals need to be removed from the ssa in order to recover p as struvite and to meet the guidelines of fertilizer therefore sequential acid and alkali treatment of ssa was conducted to achieve p rich solution selectively removing ca and heavy metals 9 sequential acid and alkali treatment leached 74 1 g t p 73 8 of t p from ssa and 67 9 g po4 3 p 67 7 of t p from ssa from kg ssa heavy metals content in the leachate was very low and below the guideline cr and pb were below the detection limit by icp oes table 4 3 2 recovery of n and p by struvite precipitation 3 2 1 chemical and biological characteristics of the recovered product composition of the elements and heavy metals in the recovered precipitate is shown in table 5 po4 3 p and nh4 n were calculated from the result of wet chemical analysis the amount of recovered precipitate was 8 g and the recovered po4 3 p and nh4 n in the precipitate were 1 000 2 and 422 5 mg respectively therefore 125 mg po4 3 p and 52 8 mg nh4 n were contained in a gram g recovered in the precipitate the composition of the harvested precipitate showed po4 3 p 12 5 nh4 n 5 3 and mg2 9 3 and compared with the theoretical value of struvite table 6 the elemental composition of the recovered struvite depends on different kinds of waste sources ranging from 10 1 to 12 65 of p 28 29 the struvite composition obtained from this study was slightly higher than the report of liu et al in which the composition was p 11 5 n 4 97 and mg 9 45 30 po4 3 p nh4 n mg2 molar ratio of the obtained precipitate was 1 07 1 00 1 02 which was close to the theoretical ratio of struvite 1 1 1 therefore it was thought that the precipitate mostly consisted of struvite however the precipitate had slightly higher molar ratio of po4 3 p and mg2 than nh4 n implying the presence of mg p compounds in the precipitate struvite content in the precipitate could be estimated by the nh4 n content in the precipitate because nh4 n rarely forms precipitate other than struvite in this experimental condition 21 from the analysis the recovered precipitate of this study had 92 6 struvite content suzuki et al obtained similar struvite content 95 from swine wastewater 31 for the analysis of p bioavailability of the precipitates the harvested product was analyzed by 2 citric acid method 32 the recovered product showed 91 2 of p bioavailability similar p bioavailability 94 could be found in the studies of melia et al 33 and xu et al 22 while extractable p from struvite reagent by neutral ammonium citrate method was 96 2 in the study of vaneeckhaute et al 34 the result indicated that the recovered product from the sludge and ssa had a sufficient bioavailability and an efficacy as a p fertilizer heavy metals content of the recovered precipitate was also investigated to determine the possibility of using the precipitate as a fertilizer the results showed that heavy metals content was much lower than the fertilizer guideline limit table 5 it implied that the recovered product had a negligible environmental risk and could be directly used as a fertilizer therefore n and p compounds were successfully recovered as struvite and fertilizing property is comparable with other commercial fertilizers even though the sludge and ssa contain complex compounds including heavy metals 3 2 2 spectroscopic analysis of the recovered precipitate the xrd patterns of the harvested product and the database peaks of reference struvite were compared fig 2 the patterns were matched well with the unique pattern of the reference struvite at the 2 theta peaks of 15 04 15 85 16 5 20 91 21 50 27 13 30 6 31 97 and 33 29 35 it proved the formation of struvite crystal atr ftir absorption bands of po4 3 511 1010 1083 cm 1 nh4 2854 2925 cm 1 mg2 461 683 cm 1 and vibration resulting from oh and nh elongation 3240 to 3529 cm 1 were observed in fig 3 36 atr ftir spectrum could show the other co precipitated compounds during the struvite crystallization originpro version 8 0 0 was used for the phosphate vibration modes occurring at the range of 700 1200 cm 1 by comparing with the result of vogel et al 37 and bekiaris et al 38 table 7 the peaks for calcium phosphate dibasic amorphous cahpo4 magnesium phosphate mg3 po4 2 and brushite cahpo4 2h2o were observed at 1044 0 984 9 and 894 1 cm 1 respectively fig 4 it seemed that high ph condition of this study might favor the co precipitation of mg p and ca p 39 meanwhile the peaks occurred at 753 7 and 1079 1 cm 1 were the struvite peaks according to bekiaris et al 38 as a result the solid struvite was probably existed with the amorphous cahpo4 mg3 po4 2 and cahpo4 2h2o in this experiment 3 3 mass balance analysis n and p mass balance analysis were performed for the recovery process from the sludge and ssa to the recovered product fig 5 when the sewage sludge 139 3 g t n kg sludge was hydrolyzed only 8 5 of t n was released into the solution as nh4 n 11 9 g nh4 n kg was for struvite precipitation 40 g of the sludge cake was suspended in 1 l solution therefore the amount of nh4 n was 480 mg l 34 3 mmol of nh4 n l after struvite precipitation 422 5 mg was participated in struvite precipitation therefore 88 0 of nh4 n could be recovered in the precipitate from the hydrolyzed sludge solution however only 7 6 of t n in the sludge cake was recovered as struvite due to its low hydrolysis efficiency as nh4 n it is the bottleneck of n recovery from the sludge and needs to increase the conversion of t n in the sludge into nh4 n in order to enhance struvite yield in the original ssa the amount of t p was 100 3 g kg ssa after leaching procedure 67 7 of po4 3 p 67 9 g po4 3 p kg ssa could be leached out into the solution as l s ratio of 10 was used the amount of po4 3 p released was 6790 mg l in order to avoid overuse of po4 3 p from the ssa leached solution it was needed to check the containing po4 3 p concentration in the sludge solution in the 40 g of sludge the t p present in the sludge was 924 mg table 1 after hydrolysis 412 mg 13 3 mmol po4 3 p l of hydrolyzed sludge solution of po4 3 p was hydrolyzed into the solution table 2 for struvite precipitation po4 3 p was also needed to be 34 3 mmol l as nh4 n therefore another 21 0 mmol 651 mg po4 3 p was required from the ssa solution in total 1063 mg of po4 3 p was provided to the combined solution after struvite crystallization 1 000 2 mg of po4 3 p was recovered in the precipitates therefore 94 1 of the po4 3 p was successfully recovered from the combined solution however as all of the po4 3 p could not reached into solution from the sludge cake and ssa during hydrolysis and leaching procedure respectively the overall p recovery efficiency was 53 9 as po4 3 p considering much lower nh4 n recovery efficiency from the sludge than that of po4 3 p from ssa further research is needed to increase t n conversion to nh4 n during the sludge hydrolysis for economical struvite production 3 4 practical application of nutrient recovery from sewage sludge as struvite treating the waste sludge to meet with the emission guideline is a burden for wastewater treatment plant due to high operating cost however in this study waste sludge could be remanufactured as struvite 49 3 g of waste sludge 40 g of was and 9 3 g of ssa were successfully transformed into 7 4 g of value added product struvite 8 g precipitate with struvite content of 92 6 therefore it was the conversion of 15 of the total mass of sludge waste into valuable fertilizer in addition as all the required p and n for this struvite production was completely obtained from sludge waste any outcome for regent p and n could be avoided moreover high struivte content of the obtained product could make sure the harvested product to achieve the high market selling price therefore this study showed the practical application potential for both wastewater industry and fertilizer industry 4 conclusions this study showed that a single source of sludge could support the required p and n for struvite precipitation by applying two different pretreatment methods alkaline hydrolysis at ph 12 0 released nh4 n and po4 3 p nh4 n po4 3 p 1 2 66 in the sludge supernatant the additional p could be obtained from ssa after acid pretreated alkaline leaching method combination of the hydrolysate of sewage sludge and the leachate of ssa successfully recovered n and p as struvite with recovery of nh4 n 88 0 and po4 3 p 94 1 the similarity of elemental composition was high between obtained product and theoretical struvite moreover it had high struvite content 92 6 high p bioavailability 91 2 and a very low level of heavy metals therefore this studied struvite production pathway could be a promising way to reduce the economic barrier of struvite production meanwhile a scale up of this struvite production strategy is warranted declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
