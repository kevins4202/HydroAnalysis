21710,in the present work a parameter study across a range of intrinsic wave periods wave heights current velocities hub immersion depths yaw misalignments and tip speed ratios on the dynamic behavior of blade root bending moments has been performed for evaluating the dynamic loading a modified unsteady blade element momentum bem model was prepared and coupled with linear and non linear wave theories firstly a validation study with previous experimental and numerical work was performed fifth order model gave more realistic results taking in consideration the effects of current on wave properties so the parameter study calculations were performed using the fifth order model the effect of varying wave period wave height and current velocity with and without the presence of yaw misalignment range on the response of root bending moments has been studied in addition the effects of tidal immersion depth variation at different flow conditions have been investigated also the bending moments behavior due to the change of tip speed ratio has been studied through investigating the effects of wave height wave period and current velocity variation in the presence of yaw misalignment range it has been observed that the in plane bending moments reduction over their median loading have a greater reduction at high wave heights and steep waves respectively furthermore yaw misalignment variation became more influential at higher velocities while the in plane bending moments reduction to average loadings had greater values at low velocities due to wave height and wave period increase the maximum loading ranges of 233 more than the double of the median out of plane bending moment and 146 of the median in plane bending moment were observed the submergence ratio reduction seemed to have minor effects even with increasing the current velocity while had a higher influence at increased wave heights also the excessive increase in the turbine rotational speed has caused a significant increase in the in plane bending moment frequency oscillations which in turn affects the quality of the electricity production keywords tidal current turbine unsteady bem model dynamic loading parametric study blade root bending moments non linear wave models 1 introduction tidal current power can be described as a highly density reliable and predictable renewable energy source it has been reported that an available tidal power of 95 and 61 3 twh year are available in the uk and china respectively the crown estate 2012 liu et al 2011 sites of high flow velocities are attractive to developers for maximizing the extraction power by the tidal current turbines tcts the pentland firth uk and east china sea channels are considered promising sites of tidal current power exploitation due to their high flow velocities that exceed 5 and 4 m s respectively liu et al 2011 draper et al 2014 the tidal turbines in such energetic sites with powerful waters experience high loads from both currents and waves which need to be correctly predicted the structural design of tct s devices must be gained from the proper quantification of the hydrodynamic loading resulted from turbulence surface waves and sheared flows milne et al 2010 2017 these loads accelerate fatigue occurrence which in turn leads to turbine failure the unsteady velocities induced by waves are multiple orders of magnitude larger than those imparted by flow turbulence lust et al 2013 to confirm the economic competition of tcts with other renewable energy systems it is crucial to guarantee the long term service life of turbine components through the characterization of dynamic loads that will result in decreasing the maintenance and repair costs as there are already examples of rotor failures have been reported shulman 2008 cbcnews 2010 2011 these failures occurred due to the improper estimation of the hydrodynamic loadings resulted in some energetic sites shulman 2008 cbcnews 2010 or the incorrect design of the turbine blades which was unsuitable for surviving these powerful environments cbcnews 2011 the first studies of tidal turbines were focused on the steady characteristics of performance behavior myers and bahaj 2006 bahaj et al 2007 batten et al 2007 recently there is a great interest in the turbine dynamic loading resulted from wave current interactions many experimental and numerical studies have investigated the dynamic behavior of turbine performance of scale model horizontal axis tcts immersed in towing and flume tanks to highlight the strong influence of surface waves lust et al 2013 gaurier et al 2013 guo et al 2018 luznik et al 2013 de jesus henriques et al 2014 it was reported that the mean values of both power and thrust coefficients in the presence of waves were identical to those predicted from cases of current only conditions gaurier et al 2013 used a scale model horizontal axis tct of 0 9 m rotor diameter in a flume tank with two wave periods 1 4 and 2 s and wave amplitudes of 0 08 and 0 14 m at a current velocity of 0 6 m s significant effects were observed due to wave presence through the resulted cyclic fluctuations on the turbine loads that reached 40 more than their mean values emphasizing the importance of considering wave current effects on the fatigue analysis for the structures of tidal turbine components a near value to this percentage was obtained in the study performed by guo et al 2018 of a 0 8 m rotor diameter scale model turbine immersed in a towing tank with towing velocity of 0 68 m s the fluctuation amplitudes of thrust and torque reached up to 50 of their mean values due to surface waves of 1 6 s wave period and 0 14 m wave height the average power coefficient cp in the case of current only conditions was 0 38 in the study performed by luznik et al 2013 that was conducted in a towing tank using a 0 46 m rotor diameter with a towing velocity of 0 6 m s the fluctuations in power coefficient due to surface wave of 1 78 s wave period and 0 076 m wave height were in the range of 0 25 cp 0 45 besides to waves the effects of tidal immersion depth has been studied by lust et al 2013 in a towing tank utilizing a scale model of 0 8 m diameter and towing velocity of 1 68 m s it was reported that a significant increase in the rotor power and thrust was observed due to reducing the tidal immersion from z d 2 25 to z d 1 3 where z is the vertical coordinate which has a value of zero at the water free surface and d is the turbine rotor diameter similar findings were reported by the study performed by milne et al 2010 where a significant effect of the hub immersion depth variation on the out of plane bending moment was observed opposite results were reported from the study conducted by nevalainen et al 2016 where the immersion depth change was observed to have minor effects the effects of flow direction in the presence of waves have been investigated by martinez et al 2018 utilizing a 1 2 m rotor diameter scale model turbine in a circular basin where it was subjected to combined waves and current the power and thrust coefficients were measured at wave properties of 2 s wave period and 0 102 m wave height on a current velocity of 0 8 m s at yaw angles of 0 10 and 20 it was reported that the presence of waves at a yaw angle of 0 has resulted in an increase in the standard deviation of thrust and torque reached to the double of the cases of current only conditions the measurements performed by evans 2014 and easton 2013 at two actual sites have confirmed that the inflow direction can deviate with an angle up to 20 relative to the main flow direction between flood and ebb conditions this range was used for adjusting the range of yaw misalignment investigated in the present study for investigating the variation effect of many input parameters on the eccentric rotor load pattern and out of plane bending moments a sensitivity analysis on a numerical tct model was performed by nevalainen 2016 where a single input parameter was varied and the other parameters were kept constant the most influential parameters were the current velocity wave height wave period rotor radius current shear and blade pitch while the submergence ratio and blade geometry had a minor influence within the investigated ranges barltrop et al 2006 investigated the influence of waves on the hydrodynamic loading of blade root bending moments of a three bladed 0 35 m rotor diameter of a horizontal axis tct experimentally and numerically the experiments were performed in a towing tank where the turbine was towed with a fixed speeds varied from 0 3 to 1 m s the wave frequencies wave heights and rotational speed were varied to investigate its effects on the resulted dynamic loading it was observed that due to the presence of waves the amplitudes of blade root in plane and out of plane bending moments were increased by 100 and 50 respectively with loading fluctuation ranges of 200 and 67 to their mean values respectively this study was extended by the same researchers barltrop et al 2007 where additional experimental and numerical study was performed by using another scale model of increased rotor diameter of 0 4 m for increasing the rotor thrust and torque the experiments were conducted in the same towing tank for investigating the influence of wave parameters on the predicted rotor torque and thrust where a parametric study was introduced it was reported that the rotor torque was increased due to the presence of waves at low current velocities while the mean thrust remains unaffected also at low wave frequencies the change in wave height has a significant influence in the rotor torque and thrust an increase in the rotational speed of the rotor was found to cause a considerable increase in the mean thrust and torque the performance characteristics due to the presence of waves and yaw misalignment were studied through an experimental study on a three bladed horizontal axis tct of 1 0 m rotor diameter by galloway et al 2010 the turbine was immersed in a towing tank where it was towed with a fixed speed of 1 5 m s due to surface waves the thrust and torque were fluctuated around the mean values of ranges 37 and 35 respectively the effects of yaw misalignment were also investigated where a reduction in power of 20 was reported at yaw angle of 22 5 galloway et al 2014 performed further experimental and numerical investigations using another scale model of rotor diameter of 0 8 m in a towing tank where the turbine was towed with a fixed speed of 0 9 m s the experiments were conducted at two immersion depths where the wave frequencies of 0 75 0 5 and 0 35 hz and wave heights of 0 1 m and 0 15 m respectively were used it was reported that due to the presence of waves and yaw misalignment the cyclic fluctuation ranges of blade root out of plane and in plane bending moments were in the order of 175 and 100 respectively of its mean values the loading ranges of bending moments to their median values that were reported by barltrop et al 2006 are significantly different from those predicted by galloway et al 2014 that was attributed to the differences of the turbines geometries and wave parameters that were implemented in the two experiments also the high loading amplitude of in plane bending moment of 200 of the mean value which was reported by barltrop et al 2006 was attributed to the use of very heavy blades that formed approximately 50 of the average in plane bending moment in regard to the numerical models that have been used for calculating the induced wave velocities the majority of previous numerical studies that used the bem model for evaluating the dynamic loading behavior of tcts utilized linear wave theory barltrop et al 2006 2007 faudot and dahlhaug 2012 lust et al 2013 galloway et al 2014 guo et al 2018 draycott et al 2019 the main problem of linear wave theory is that the current effects on wave are not accounted for where the current velocity is simply superimposed to the horizontal wave particle velocities some studies have reported that linear wave theory results were unreliable through studying the wave current interaction strokosz 1987 has reported that the dynamic loading resulted by using linear wave theory are inaccurate and may be under predicted or over predicted furthermore zheng et al 2008 performed experimental investigations on the vertical characteristics of current velocity profiles in a flume in the presence of wave and current it was observed that the resulted current profiles from experimental data and linear wave theory were different barltrop et al 2006 reported that in steep waves the linear wave theory under predicted the bending moments furthermore by reducing the tidal immersion depth and increasing the wave periods in the study conducted by galloway et al 2014 the linear wave theory under predicted the out of plane bending moments due to the shortcomings of linear wave theory a non linear third order model developed by kishida and sobey 1988 and fifth order model developed by fenton 1985 are coupled with the modified bem model for predicting the hydrodynamic loadings in the present study in light of above a more expanded parametric study than that performed by barltrop et al 2007 is implemented where a numerical investigation of the variation effects of wave height wave period hub immersion depth yaw misalignment rotational speed and current velocity are presented these parameters shown in table 1 were selected due to its significant influence in the dynamic loadings the wave height and period were found to have great effects as reported by barltrop et al 2007 gaurier et el 2013 luznik et al 2013 galloway et al 2014 nevalainen et al 2016 and guo et al 2018 also similar effects were observed for the hub immersion depth milne et al 2010 lust et al 2013 the effect of yaw misalignment was found to have also significant effects martinez et al 2018 galloway et al 2010 2014 moreover the variation effect of current velocity and turbine rotational speed were found to have considerable effects on the resulted loadings barltrop et al 2007 so a deeper and expanded investigation is required for studying the effect of the combined change of these parameters with each other to provide the reader with a better understanding of the behavior of out of plane and in plane bending moments this study is expected to be important for the tcts in the structural design stage for quantifying the resulted hydrodynamic loadings the rotor geometry data of galloway et al 2014 shown in table 2 is used though this numerical study where the 1 20 scale model turbine is a froude scaled to be representative of a full scale 16 m rotor diameter tct immersed in a tidal depth of 37 m the wave parameters and current velocity were numerically modeled and chosen to be representative of a maximum full scale wave height of 4 m wave period of 12 8 s and current velocity of 4 92 m s the ranges of the investigated parameters are shown in table 1 firstly a validation study between the experimental and numerical data of galloway et al 2014 and the present numerical model is presented through this validation an advanced unsteady bem model coupled with wave theories is used for predicting the dynamic loading besides linear wave theory third order and fifth order models are coupled with the modified bem model the results of the three wave theories are assessed and accordingly one model is used in the investigation of parameters variation influence 2 mathematical model 2 1 modified unsteady bem model the bem model coupled with linear and non linear wave theories have been used in this study for evaluating the dynamic loading resulted from wave current flow field actually the classical bem model with its assumptions is not capable of achieving this task and must include some modifications firstly the steady bem model must be corrected to count for three dimensional 3 d losses at blade tip and hub also stall delay angle of attack extrapolation and high loading corrections must be included secondly the bem model must count the elemental dynamic loads at blade rotation at each azimuthal position as the inflow current velocity no longer be deemed as uniform so it must be changed as a function of azimuth angle that in turn is changed to time besides dynamic stall correction must be included in the modified bem model to count for elemental lift coefficient and angle of attack corrections furthermore dynamic inflow correction must be inserted due to the inertial response of the rotor the modified bem model is performed in successive subroutines firstly the rotor geometry lift and drag coefficients with the corresponding angle of attack axial and tangential force coefficients axial and tangential induction factors tip and hub loss corrections are fed in an iterative procedure with the convergence of angle of attack the calculated wave velocities are also added to the iterative procedures in case of yawed flow rotor misalignment to the inflow current skewed axial flow correction should also be included due to the two dimensional 2 d flow assumptions of the bem theory the radial flow losses at blade tip and hub were not accounted for thus the accuracy of the theory was affected therefore glauert 1935 presented a correction factor to be implemented at the tip while moriarty and hansen 2005 proposed a similar expression as a correction factor at the hub the lift and drag coefficients were generated by xfoil code drela 1989 as 2 d coefficients so the 3 d flow effects were not taken in consideration the 3 d stall delay correction was applied to the lift coefficient by using du and selig 2000 model while eggars hansen 2004 model was used for correcting the drag coefficient because of the high range of inflow angles the predicted angles of attack range by xfoil may be exceeded so viterna and corrigan 1982 methodology extrapolated the lift and drag coefficients at a high range of angles of attack 180 at high loading conditions the bem theory fails and reverse flow was obtained the thrust coefficient was under estimated due to the assumptions of the stream tube model of no flow interactions with the control volume buhl 2005 correction was introduced through improving glauert s model yielding a smooth transition from glauert parabola to the classical bemt prediction chapman et al 2013 the bem model coupled with wave theory cannot be used directly for evaluating the dynamic loading generated from wave current flow field and yaw misalignment effects as it must contain some modifications and correction models due to the wave effects and blade rotation the elemental azimuthal position be very substantial and should be taken into account as the inflow current cannot be considered as uniform as a result the dynamic loading for each rotor blade must be calculated individually as the inflow current seen by one blade is different from the others due to the difference in azimuthal positions fig 1 presents the rotor geometry with illustration of the yaw misalignment and azimuthal rotation as shown in the figure ω is the angular velocity of the rotor ψ is the azimuthal angle r is the local elemental radius γ is the yaw angle of the upstream flow χ is the skew angle of the wake and u o is the inflow current velocity that be considered positive if it is in the same direction of wave propagation and negative it is in the opposite direction for modelling wave velocity by the wave theories and including azimuthal positions for each blade element and yaw misalignment the problem must be function on time time as a function of blade element azimuthal angle in the presence of yaw effects is calculated from eq 1 1 t i ψ r λ u o r sin ψ sin γ u o where λ is the tip speed ratio tsr and r is the radius of the rotor the second part of eq 1 is the resulted time because of yaw misalignment the tip speed ratio can be calculated from eq 2 2 λ ω r u o due to the acquired oscillations from surface waves the hydrodynamic coefficients predicted by xfoil as well as the corresponding angles of attack need to be modified also the time lagged response of the rotor inertia to flow dynamic conditions is highly recommended to be corrected so two correction models dynamic stall and dynamic inflow models are included in the unsteady modified bem model 2 2 dynamic stall correction lift coefficients and its corresponding angles of attack are strongly recommended to be corrected due to dynamic stall effects which result from the continuous fluctuations in the inflow velocity blade rotation and surface waves are the main sources of angle of attack oscillations that in turn lead to inflow velocity fluctuations in the current work boeing vertol model tarzanin 1972 containing an empirical time domain coefficient as a tuning parameter is employed within the modified unsteady bem model performing dynamic stall model is not an easy task because it relies on the previous change rate of the angle of attack α so an additional complete run must be performed for that purpose changes of elemental angle of attack and lift coefficients due to implementing dynamic stall model can be calculated from eqs 3 and 4 3 α d α a 1 c α 2 u α α 4 c l d c l 0 c l α d c l 0 α d α where c l and α are the elemental lift coefficient and angle of attack respectively a1 is an empirical time domain coefficient subscript d refers to the dynamic stall correction and α is the change rate of azimuthal angles of attack 2 3 dynamic inflow correction according to steady bem theory an increase in the flow velocity must be directly accompanied with an immediate increase in the rotor power in reality this instantaneous response of the rotor cannot occur due to the inertial response of the system there is a continuous variation in the inflow velocity due to surface waves yaw misalignment effects and flow turbulence which in turn lead to time lagged response because of the rotor blades inertia to account for rotor inertial response pitt and peters 1981 have introduced what is called dynamic inflow correction burton et al 2011 has described the total axial force on a disc by using eq 5 where the coefficient c t d was used to describe the contribution of the dynamic acceleration that must be added to the total thrust coefficient 5 f x 0 5 ρ u 2 π r 2 c t d galloway et al 2014 implemented burton s definition of the dynamic acceleration addition that accounts for the system losses for developing pitt and peters 1981 dynamic inflow model to introduce a new model for calculating blade dynamic bending moments in the present study the dynamic inflow model proposed by galloway et al 2014 was implemented in the unsteady bem model as shown from eqs 6 8 dynamic out of plane bending moment m x d consists of steady and relative out of plane bending moments m x is the out of plane bending moment resulted from steady bem model while m x r e l accounts for the contribution of dynamic acceleration calculated through the coefficient c x d for dynamic in plane bending moment m y d it can be calculated by using the same method where gravitational moment component is added to the steady and relative in plane bending moments for more details about this model the reader is referred to galloway s paper 6 m x d m x m x r e l 7 m x 0 5 ρ w 2 c r r c x 8 m x r e l 0 5 ρ u 2 r 3 π c

coupled with the modified bem model for validating the present numerical model with the experimental data of galloway et al 2014 due to the drawbacks of linear wave theory that were mentioned in the literature two non linear wave theories third order and fifth order models are coupled also with the modified unsteady bem model the results from the three models will be assessed through a validation study to reveal the reliable model that will be used in the parametric study in the following subsections a brief summary about linear wave theory third order and fifth order models are introduced 2 4 1 linear wave theory linear wave theory describes the kinematics and dynamics of wave propagation linearly it assumes that the fluid flow is inviscid incompressible and irrotational having a uniform tidal depth in tidal turbines the wave theory is implemented for calculating the wave particle velocities at each blade element position so the wave velocity equations are dependent on time and elemental azimuthal position linear wave uses the velocity potential to describe the motion of waves the velocity potential horizontal and vertical wave particle velocities are calculated through the eqs 9 11 9 φ u x h 2 ω r cosh k d z i sinh k d sin k x r ω r t i 10 u r φ x u h 2 ω r cosh k d z i sinh k d cos k x r ω r t i 11 w r φ z h 2 ω r sinh k d z i sinh k d sin k x r ω r t i where d is the water depth k is the wave number h is the wave height t i is the time instant x r is the stream wise distance in the direction of wave propagation and z i is the vertical position for each blade element that can be calculated according to the tidal depth and azimuth angle from the following equation 12 z i z h r cos ψ where z h represents the rotor hub immersion depth in actual sites the turbine is fixed so the doppler shift occurs due to the moving reference frame as a result the particle wave velocities are superimposed to the inflow current velocity hedges et al 1985 iso 2005 as shown in eq 10 due to doppler shift the wave period differs accordingly for a stationary reference frame the wave period is apparent t a while for a moving reference frame the wave period is intrinsic or relative t i as a result the wave frequency is classified into apparent ω a and relative ω r where ω a ω r k u hedges et al 1985 the dispersion relation that connect the angular wave frequency wave number and tidal depth for linear wave theory is shown in the following equation 13 ω r g k tanh k d 2 4 2 third order model for investigating a higher order interaction between propagating steady waves on a linear shear current kishida and sobey 1988 presented a modified third order stokes theory based on k h 2 as the expansion parameter a constant vorticity is imposed for the linear shear current and as a result the wave motion remains irrotational a moving reference frame has the same speed as wave speed c with coordinates x and z located at the sea bed where the wave motion is assumed to be two dimensional inviscid and steady from both current surface velocity u s and bottom velocity u b the mean eulerian current u m and current vorticity ω o are calculated according to eqs 14 and 15 14 u m u s u s u b 2 15 ω 0 u s u b d where the current surface velocity was obtained by using the 1 7th power law the dispersion relation for this model was defined by using eq 16 which was solved iteratively by using newton raphson method for calculating the unknown wave number k 16 g k tanh k d 0 5 a 11 k h 2 2 a 20 u m 1 2 ω 0 k c 0 d c 0 where c is the wave speed and the coefficients of a 11 and a 20 have not mentioned here for brevity and can be obtained from paper kishida and sobey 1988 ω 0 is the dimensionless constant vorticity obtained by the relation 17 ω 0 ω 0 k c 0 where c 0 is the airy wave speed by the use of perturbation expansion and euler equation the solution of the third order stokes on a linear shear current was introduced according to the moving reference frame through the stream function as shown in eq 18 the horizontal and vertical wave particle velocities were derived from the stream function as u r ψ z and w r ψ x 18 ψ c 0 k a 00 k z a 01 k z 2 ε a 11

listed in the stream function equation must be transmitted relative to the fixed reference frame through eqs 19 and 20 19 x x c t 20 z z where x and z are the fixed reference frame coordinates 2 4 3 fifth order stokes theory a higher order governing potential velocity equation is needed to model highly turbulent waves that are near to the breaking point a fifth order stokes theory was derived by fenton 1985 where the dimensionless wave height kh 2 was considered as the expansion parameter for the perturbation expansion of the fourier series this expansion inserted a detailed set of expansion parameters that are used in the equations of the particle wave theories more details can be obtained from the paper fenton 1985 this model assumes periodic steady propagating waves where a moving reference frame is considered having the same velocity of waves c and coordinates of x and y positioned in the sea bed also a stationary reference frame is considered with coordinates of x and y the transformation from the stationary to the moving reference frame occurs according to eqs 21 and 22 21 x x c t 22 y y according to the moving reference frame the time averaged eulerian current velocity c e is obtained by eq 23 23 c e c u where u is the mean current velocity the dispersion relation that relates the wave parameters is introduced as follows 24 c 0 ε 2 c 2 ε 4 c 4 u k g 1 2 0 where ε k h 2 is the expansion parameter which the coefficients of c 0 c 2 and c 4 are dependent on as mentioned before these coefficients can be obtained from fenton s paper eq 24 can be solved by iteration through newton raphson method for the unknown wave number according to the moving reference frame the velocity potential is given according to eq 25 the velocity potential is transferred to the fixed reference frame by using the eqs 21 and 22 to include the time domain 25 φ x y u x c 0 g k 3 1 2 i 1 5 ε i j 1 i a i j cosh j k y sin j k x the a i j constants are given in fenton s paper the horizontal and vertical particle wave velocities are calculated from the velocity potential equation by u r φ x and w r φ y 2 5 additional modifications due to waves and yaw misalignment due to the inclusion of waves in the bem model the relative flow velocity was corrected through modifying the inflow angle at each elemental azimuthal position according to eq 26 by modifying inflow angle the angle of attack and the corresponding lift and drag coefficients are changed accordingly as a result the axial and tangential force coefficients and their dependent parameters such as axial tangential induction factors power and thrust coefficients are changed 26 tan ϕ u r 1 a ω r 1 a w r where a and a are the axial and tangential induction factors respectively due to skewed wake the axial induction factor must be modified accordingly at each blade element the implementation of this correction in the modified bem model has caused contradictions in both out of plane and in plane bending moments when validated with experimental results during the study that has performed by galloway et al 2014 so the correction of axial induction factor was omitted in the current modified bem model yaw misalignment are included in the calculations of axial and tangential force coefficients respectively as shown in eqs 27 and 28 27 c x c l cos ϕ c d sin ϕ cos γ 28 c y c l sin ϕ c d cos ϕ cos 2 γ where c l c d are lift and drag coefficients respectively 3 results and discussion firstly a validation study was presented though comparing the results of the modified bem model coupled with wave theories with previous experimental and numerical data to assess the accuracy and reliability of the present numerical work then a parametric study was performed for getting a better understanding of the dynamic loading behavior of a horizontal axis tct through presenting the response of blade root bending moments to a range of flow conditions 3 1 validation study for validating the present numerical work a modified unsteady bem model was prepared and modified according to the corrections that previously mentioned in sections 2 1 2 2 and 2 3 galloway et al 2014 work was simulated by using the modified bem model coupled with linear wave theory third order and fifth order models the results were validated with galloway s experimental and numerical data the resulted dynamic loading of blade root out of plane and in plane bending moments from wave properties of 2 s intrinsic wave period and wave height of 0 1 m on a current velocity of 0 9 m s were presented in figs 2 and 3 fig 2 shows the out of plane bending moment where the results of the linear wave theory was compared with galloway s experimental and numerical work in the upper graph while the third order and fifth order results were presented in the lower graph and compared with galloway s experimental data the present numerical results of linear wave theory outweighed galloway s numerical work and showed a very good agreement with the experimental results for the out of plane bending moments resulted from the third order and fifth order models it differed from the experimental results in loading phase and frequency but had a relatively equal ultimate loading range by comparing the loading range of non linear models and linear wave theory it was found that non linear models had slightly higher loading ranges the differences between experimental work and the non linear models are attributed to the absence of current in galloway s experimental work where the turbine was mounted on a carriage and towed with a fixed speed to represent the current velocity so the current effect on the wave field was not accounted for in the experiments for linear wave theory the current velocity was superimposed to the horizontal wave particle velocity and its effects on the waves were not also taken in consideration so the linear wave theory results have a good agreement with the experimental data on the other hand the third order and fifth order models took in consideration the effects of current on wave properties as shown in their stream function and velocity potential relations resulting in dynamic loading differed in wave length and phase from the experimental and linear wave theory results the increased wave length in case of both third order and fifth order models due to the presence of a following current in the same direction of wave propagation was also confirmed by previous studies brevik and bjørn 1979 wolf and prandle 1999 zaman 2008 it is seen that the both models have the same loading wave length and almost the loading range the third order model results had more loading oscillations all over the time range comparing with experimental and fifth order data that may be attributed to considering the current shear instead of uniform current velocity for in plane bending moment results shown in fig 3 linear wave theory showed a reasonable agreement in loading frequency and amplitude comparing with galloway s experimental and numerical data the results of third order and fifth order models also differed in loading phase and frequency resulted in a little higher loading ranges comparing with the experimental results the average out of plane and in plane bending moments over the rotor blades resulted from the third order and fifth order models were compared as shown in fig 4 it is obvious that the average bending moments are identical in loading phase frequency and range which ensures the confidence and accuracy of the results obtained from the both models at fig 5 the resulted out of plane bending moment was presented at a 2 86 s wave period at the same wave height and current velocity of the previous comparison with yaw angle of 15 the results of linear wave theory showed a better agreement with experimental data comparing with galloway s numerical study for the high wave period of 2 86 s in this case the third order model failed to solve the dispersion relation indicating the incapability of the model of solving the wave current field at high wave periods fifth order model as a higher order non linear wave theory could solving the dispersion relation resulting in a higher wave length comparing with linear wave theory and experimental results the dynamic loading of out of plane bending moment resulted from fifth order model differed in phase and frequency from the experimental data but had a slightly lower loading range for the validation study due to the agreements between the experimental data and the present modified bem model coupled with linear wave theory it could be concluded that the modified unsteady bem model its corrections and linear wave theory were accurately applied and implemented in the current numerical study it could be seen that the present modified bem model coupled with linear wave theory has surpassed galloway s numerical model in predicting out of plane and in plane bending moments that may be attributed to the accuracy of the steady bem model which greatly affects the unsteady model results the steady bem model relies on the 2 d lift and drag coefficients which were predicted by xfoil code in both the present and galloway s studies these coefficients should be calculated at the proper chord based reynolds numbers and turbulence transition parameters ncrit otherwise the steady bem model will be significantly affected el shahat et al 2020 furthermore the implemented corrections of the steady bem model mentioned in section 2 1 also affect the model accuracy koh and ng 2016 masters at al 2011 all these parameters affect the steady bem model and hence the modified bem model and its results so the poor prediction of galloway s numerical model may be attributed to one of the mentioned reasons it is observed also that the out of plane bending moments predicted by galloway s model are more affected than in plane bending moments that is due to the high values of the axial force coefficients that affect the out of plane bending moments comparing with the low values of the tangential force coefficients which in turn lead to minor effects on the in plane bending moments the third order and fifth order models accounted for current effects on wave properties and gave more realistic results than linear wave theory at high wave periods the third order model failed to solve the wave current field so the fifth order model was considered the best choice at low and high wave periods taking in consideration the current effects on wave field so it is implemented in the parameter study that is presented in the following section many blockage corrections were applied to the data of the tct model by galloway et al 2014 however the final results were not satisfactory finally depending on the low value of blockage ratio 7 the correction was neglected galloway et al 2014 many previous studies where turbine model experiments were performed having blockage ratios of 6 and 6 3 respectively without correcting for blockage effects ordonez sanchez et al 2010 myers and bahaj 2009 furthermore the numerical study of turner and owen 2009 showed that blockage ratios larger than 7 8 have significant influence on the turbine power coefficient cp for lower ratios the blockage was seen to have minor effects for the turbine model of galloway et al 2014 the power and thrust coefficients were predicted by the present steady bem model the power and thrust were predicted accurately and a very good agreement was obtained as shown in fig 6 according to gaurier et al 2015 the blockage mainly influence the turbine performance curves at high tsrs when the thrust coefficient is high for the present case the differences between the experimental and bem model results of the power and thrust coefficients shown in fig 6 at high tsrs are not big at tsr 7 the bem model over predicted the power with up to 3 while under estimated the thrust with up to 2 comparing with the experimental data depending on the low discrepancies between the experimental and numerical results the blockage effects are believed to have limited effects on the results so it has been neglected in the present study 3 2 effects of wave period and wave height with the presence of yaw misalignment range yaw misalignment range in the study conducted by martinez et al 2018 was from 0 to 20 while the range was increased up to 22 5 in the studies performed by galloway et al 2010 and 2014 so in the present investigations the range of yaw angles was extended to be from 0 to 25 the effect of changing wave properties of intrinsic wave period and wave height with the change of yaw misalignment angles on the resulted dynamic loading is presented in fig 7 in this comparison the effect of increasing both the wave periods from 1 33 to 2 86 s and the wave heights from 0 1 to 0 2 m in the presence of yaw angle range from 0 to 25 is investigated it is clear that the increase of wave periods and wave heights lead to dynamic loading range increase while the wave height is dominant over the wave period and had a higher influence due to the increase of wave height from 0 1 to 0 2 m at a current velocity of 0 9 m s the out of plane bending moments fluctuated with significant amplitudes of 92 and 90 8 of their mean values at wave periods of 2 86 and 1 33 s respectively for in plane bending moments the fluctuation amplitudes were up to 60 8 and 56 of their mean values generally at all wave periods and heights it is observed that the presence of yaw misalignment has led to the increase of dynamic frequency oscillations for both out of plane and in plane bending moments yaw misalignments have caused a remarkable reduction in the median loading of in plane bending moments while had a slight reduction in case of out of plane bending moment this is attributed to the axial and tangential force coefficients calculated from eqs 27 and 28 where the effect of yaw cos γ is squared in case of tangential force coefficient leading to a higher reduction than the axial force coefficient the in plane bending moment reduction due to yawing the rotor with an angle of 25 at 1 33 and 2 86 s wave periods and wave heights of 0 1 and 0 2 m is shown in fig 8 it is observed that the in plane bending moment has a higher reduction at wave height of 0 2 m than at 0 1 m at the same wave period furthermore the in plane bending moment has a higher reduction at steep waves than at long waves a reduction percentage up to 37 of the in plane bending moment to median loading was observed at wave period of 1 33 s and wave height of 0 2 m while the reduction percentage at wave period of 2 86 s was 33 2 at the same conditions at fig 7 the in plane bending moment reduction due to yaw misalignments at the wave period of 2 86 s may seem higher than lower wave period of 1 33 s the graphs of low wave period are very steep so the differences are higher than what it look like from this comparison it can be concluded that a greater reduction in the turbine power comparing with thrust is expected due to yaw misalignment effects this reduction in the power becomes more influential at high wave heights and steep waves 3 3 effects of current velocity with the presence of yaw misalignment range at a fixed wave period and height the effect of current velocity variation in the presence of yaw misalignment range is shown in fig 9 the effect of velocity increase from 0 9 to 1 1 m s in a range of yaw angles from 0 to 25 is discussed according to eq 1 the increase of inflow current velocity leads to the decrease of time range so as shown in fig 9 in the cases of current velocity of 1 1 m s the time range was reduced the current velocity has a significant influence on dynamic loading ranges and their median values but has a lower effect on the loading wave length according to the dispersion relation of fifth order model eqs 23 and 24 increasing the current velocity affects the wave number and hence the wave length so it is observed that the increase of current velocity from 0 9 to 1 1 m s has resulted in an increase in the dynamic loading wave length from 8 7 to 9 23 m furthermore without yaw misalignment effects an increase of 51 and 50 of the median out of plane and in plane bending moments have been resulted due to the increase of current velocity from 0 9 to 1 1 m s due to this increase in the median loading of the bending moments the dynamic loading range over the median loading has been reduced from 94 to 77 for the out of plane bending moment and from 59 to 47 in case of in plane bending moment as shown in fig 9 it is clear that the corresponding reductions in the in plane bending moment to yaw angles of 15 20 and 25 in case of current velocity of 1 1 m s are higher than the reductions at lower current velocity of 0 9 m s the in plane bending moment reduction due to yaw misalignment angle of 25 at current velocity of 1 1 m s has led to in plane bending moment reduction up to 0 9 nm while at current velocity of 0 9 m s the in plane bending moment reduction was up to 0 65 nm so it can be said that yaw misalignment becomes more influential at higher current velocities however the ratio of in plane bending moment reduction to median loading is higher in case of lower current velocity of 0 9 m s this is attributed to the increase of median loading due to the increase of current velocity fig 10 shows the in plane bending moment reduction to the median loading corresponding to yaw misalignment angle of 25 at both current velocities of 0 9 and 1 1 m s respectively for current velocity of 1 1 m s the in plane bending moment reduction is 24 of its median loading while this ratio has increased up to 26 3 at lower current velocity of 0 9 m s 3 4 effects of combined change in current velocity wave period and wave height fig 11 shows the dynamic behavior of the out of plane and in plane bending moments to the change of wave periods wave heights and current velocities the intrinsic wave period and wave height have increased from 1 33 to 2 86 s and from 0 1 to 0 2 m respectively in a current velocity range from 0 7 to 1 1 m s according to the first part of eq 1 of time instant without yaw misalignment increasing the current velocity will cause a significant decrease to the time range so through the 30 performed revolutions of turbine rotor a large time range was obtained at current velocity of 0 7 m s while small time ranges were obtained at higher current velocities of 0 9 and 1 1 m s so a common time range from 2 2 to 11 4 s as shown in fig 11 was selected and set for the three current velocities at the present comparison it was observed that the increase of current velocity has a significant effect on the bending moments amplitudes where both the bending moments have a considerable increase due to the increase of current velocity in addition flow conditions of increased current velocity v 1 1 m s and high wave heights h 0 2 m had the maximum dynamic fluctuating range around the median value as shown in fig 11 on the other hand a significant increase in the bending moments wave length was resulted due to the increase of wave period the resulted increase of dynamic loading wave length due to the increase of wave period was higher than the resulted due to current velocity increase inferring that the effect of wave period on the wave length of the dynamic loading is dominant over the current velocity furthermore the increase of wave periods have resulted in a relatively small increase in the dynamic loading amplitudes comparing with the resulted loading amplitudes due to current velocity increase also it was observed that the increase of wave period has led to a significant increase in the frequency oscillations of the in plane bending moments for all the wave heights and current velocities these oscillations have detrimental effects on the tcts where the quality of the output power is significantly affected similar results were also confirmed by the results of nevalainen et al 2016 where a significant increase in the loading ranges of out of plane bending moments was observed due to the inflow current and wave height increase also the wave period was found to have a great effect on the loading wave length additional graphs figs 12 and 13 are added to provide more details about the effect of increasing both current velocity and wave period on the dynamic behavior of both out of plane and in plane bending moments in the presence of wave height range of 0 1 0 2 m the loading ranges over the median loads of both out of plane and in plane bending moments were drawn versus the current velocity for different wave periods and wave heights as shown in figs 12 and 13 for both bending moment graphs it can be seen that the loading ranges to their median values have maximum values at low current velocities that is attributed to the resulted high median loading values at high current velocities it can also be observed that the fluctuating loading range to the median load increases with increasing the wave heights and wave periods at fixed current velocities for out of plane bending moment the maximum loading ranges of 233 213 and 212 to their median values were seen at wave periods of 2 86 2 and 1 33 s respectively on a current velocity of 0 7 m s at these conditions the maximum in plane bending moment loading ranges of 146 141 and 119 to their median loadings were observed at higher current velocities of 0 9 and 1 1 m s the maximum out of plane bending moment loading ranges to their median values were seen at wave period of 2 s for in plane bending moment the matter is different where the maximum loading ranges to median values were obtained at wave period of 2 86 s for all current velocities it was observed also from figs 12 and 13 that the differences between bending moments to their median values due to wave period increase at the same wave height have higher values at lower current velocities than at higher current velocities especially in the in plane bending moment graphs from this comparison due to wave height and wave period increase the loading ranges to their median values reached maximum values of 233 and 146 of the out of pane and in plane bending moments respectively so the wave variation at tidal sites must be investigated carefully before the deployment stage this will be beneficial also for the proper selection of the structural design of the turbine through the quantification of the resulted hydrodynamic loads in these environments for avoiding rotor failures for the previous studies that investigated the effects of waves on the resulted dynamic loadings different cyclic fluctuations and loading ranges have been observed gaurier et al 2013 has reported that the fluctuation amplitudes of the turbine loads have reached 40 more than their mean values relatively lower percentages have been resulted in the study conducted by galloway et al 2010 where the thrust and torque were fluctuated around their mean values with ranges of 37 and 35 respectively comparing with these results higher fluctuating amplitudes were observed by guo et al 2018 the cyclic fluctuations of thrust and torque reached up to 50 of their mean values also it has been reported by barltrop et al 2006 that maximum loading ranges of out of plane and in plane bending moments of 200 and 67 to their mean values have been resulted different percentages of 175 and 100 of the out of plane and in plane bending moments respectively have been resulted in the study conducted by galloway et al 2014 in regard to the study conducted by martinez et al 2018 at a yaw angle of 0 an increase in the standard deviation of thrust and torque reached up to the double of the cases of current only conditions has been resulted from these percentages it is clear that there is a disparity in the resulted ranges of dynamic loads from a study to another this is attributed to the differences between these studies in operational geometric wave and inflow conditions to relate our results with the previous findings that mentioned in the literature it will be more suitable to relate it with the results of galloway et al 2014 as the data of the same tct model has been used in the present study galloway et al 2014 has reported that maximum loading ranges of 175 and 100 of the mean out of plane and in plane bending moments respectively have been observed at wave height and wave period of 0 1 m and 2 86 s respectively in the present study due to the wave height increase from 0 1 to 0 2 m the loading ranges of out of plane and in plane bending moments have reached up to 233 and 146 respectively of their mean values 3 5 effects of wave height at different wave periods at a fixed current velocity of 0 9 m s the effect of both wave height and period variation on the dynamic behavior of out of plane and in plane bending moments is presented in fig 14 it can be seen that the increase of wave height and wave period did not affect the median loading instead it influence the fluctuating range of both out of plane and in plane bending moments around their average values for the wave height effect on both the bending moments at all wave periods it significantly affects the dynamic loading range where a considerable increase was observed due to the increase of wave height on the other hand as shown in fig 14 the variation of wave height has a negligible effect on the wave length of the dynamic loading at the same wave period and current velocity due to the increase of wave period a significant increase on the loading wave length was observed while a slight increase in the loading amplitudes were resulted for the wave height range the maximum out of plane bending moment loading ranges to their median values were seen at wave period of 2 s while the maximum loading ranges of in plane bending moments to their median values were seen at wave period of 2 86 s the dynamic loading ranges to the median loadings of both out of plane and in plane bending moments are displayed in figs 15 and 16 for the bending moments it can be seen that the wave height has almost a linear relation with the dynamic loading ratio the maximum out of plane bending moment loading range of 185 to the average load was obtained at a wave period and wave height of 2 s and 0 2 m respectively at a wave period of 2 86 s the loading range to the median out of plane bending moment has a slightly lower values than at wave period of 2 s for in plane bending moment the matter is different where the maximum loading range of 111 relative to the median loading was observed at wave period and wave height of 2 86 s and 0 2 m respectively in the comparison of section 3 4 the maximum loading ranges to their median values were observed at the highest wave period of 2 86 s while here by increasing the current velocity the maximum out of plane loading appeared at wave period of 2 s that is attributed to the relatively lower augmentation values of loading ranges comparing with median loadings resulted from current velocity increase which in turn led to the decrease of these ratios accordingly for in plane loading ranges to median values the matter is different where the maximum loads appeared at the highest wave period of 2 86 s at all current velocities 3 6 effects of hub immersion depth reduction at different flow and wave conditions in regard to the effect of immersion depth reduction on the dynamic loadings many previous contradictory results have been reported in the study conducted by nevalainen et al 2016 it has been reported that immersion depth variation has a minor influence while the investigations performed by milne et al 2010 and lust et al 2013 have shown that it has a significant effect that may be attributed to the differences between these studies in operational geometric and inflow conditions so a deep investigation is required to study the effect of immersion depth variation on the resulted hydrodynamic loadings as a result in this part of results the effect of hub immersion depth variation on the dynamic loading behavior of out of plane and in plane bending moments has been investigated at different flow and wave conditions as shown in fig 17 by reducing the turbine hub immersion from 0 67 m to 1 13 m three submergence ratios z h d of 0 84 1 125 and 1 41 have been studied in this comparison firstly the submergence variation effect on a case of 2 s intrinsic wave period and wave height of 0 1 m on a 0 9 m s current velocity has been studied at these conditions it has been found that reducing the submergence ratio does not result in a significant increase in the dynamic loading range of both bending moments but instead has a relatively small effect within this comparison a second case was studied where the current velocity has been increased from 0 9 to 1 1 m s to study its effect on the dynamic loading in the presence of submergence ratio range due to increasing the current velocity according to eq 1 the time range has been reduced as shown in fig 17 the current velocity increase has resulted in dynamic loading range and amplitude increase while the same trend of the first case of reducing submergence ratio was seen where a small increase on both bending moments loading ranges around the median loadings was obtained a third case was presented though studying the effect of increasing wave height from 0 1 to 0 2 m in the presence of submergence ratio variation on the behavior of bending moments at a current velocity of 0 9 m s the dynamic fluctuation range of both bending moments around the median loading has been increased due to the wave height increase also it can be seen that the gained loading ranges due to the reduction of submergence ratio is significantly higher than those predicted from the previous two cases which indicating the considerable influence of submergence ratio reduction on the dynamic loading at high wave heights it is noticed also that the variation of submergence does not affect the median loading value but instead affects the dynamic loading range the gained bending moments to their median values resulted from reducing the submergence ratio from 1 41 to 0 84 and accompanied with increasing wave height from 0 1 to 0 2 m at current velocity of 0 9 m s are shown in fig 18a and 18 b respectively the maximum gained out of plane and in plane bending moments were increased up to 20 and 12 9 respectively of their mean values on the other hand with increasing current velocity from 0 9 to 1 1 m s the gained bending moments to their median values due to submergence ratio decrease were shown in fig 18c and 18 d the maximum gained out of plane and in plane bending moments to their median values were reduced up to 8 and 4 8 respectively these reductions are attributed to the median loading increase resulted from raising the current velocity from 0 9 to 1 1 m s 3 7 effects of tsr change generally at low tsr values tsr 4 the bem model struggles for conversion especially at elements near the blade root this feature is a common feature for bem codes not only for the present code at high tsrs the bem model becomes heavily dependent on the empirical corrections of high axial induction factors which affect the results accuracy if the correction is not suitable for the hydrofoil type to guarantee the convergence of the bem model for better agreements with the experimental data the turbine model experiments of galloway et al 2014 were performed at tsr range of 4 7 5 so in the present investigation the same tsr range was considered the intermediate value of 5 4 was selected because it represents the optimum tsr as reported by galloway et al 2014 and can be seen from fig 6 the present comparison was performed at fixed current velocity of 0 9 m s therefore the tsr was increased through increasing the rotor rotational speed the effect of tsr increase on the dynamic instantaneous and average loading of bending moments is presented in fig 19 the resulted instantaneous and average bending moments were displayed for tsr range from 4 to 7 5 in a 2 s wave period with a wave height of 0 1 m on a current velocity of 0 9 m s the corresponding rotational speed to the tsr values of 4 5 4 and 7 5 are 86 116 and 161 rpm respectively by increasing the tsr the median loadings of out of plane bending moments were found to be increased due to the greater rotor thrust the in plane bending moment median loadings were reduced due to the reduction in shaft torque at high tsrs similar findings were also reported from the study conducted by galloway et al 2014 according to the first part of eq 1 it can be noticed that the tsr increase leads to time reduction also from the velocity potential and stream functions of the wave models eqs 9 18 and 25 it can be observed that any change in the time leads to wave phase change as a result the three cases of the selected values for tsrs have resulted in a changed wave phase of the wave particle horizontal and vertical velocities and hence altering the resulted dynamic loading phase as shown in fig 19 for the three cases shown in fig 19 it can be observed that the dynamic loading range of out of plane bending moment has been increased due to the increase of tsr from 4 to 5 4 while was decreased at high tsr of 7 5 for the loading range of in plane bending moment it was found to be significantly decreased with increasing tsrs in addition another influence of tsr increase was observed in the increased frequency oscillations that appeared in both the bending moments especially the in plane bending moment at tsr 7 5 the increased frequency oscillations have a significant influence on the quality of the electrical power and causes flicker which may require advanced electronic devices for smoothing the output power so such operational conditions should be avoided 4 conclusions this paper introduces a parametric study across a range of parameters through modeling the dynamic behavior of blade root bending moments of a 1 20 scale model tidal turbine the model is a froude scaled to be representative of a full scale 16 m rotor diameter tct that is immersed in a tidal depth of 37 m the wave parameters and current velocity were numerically modeled and chosen to be representative of a maximum wave height of 4 m wave period of 12 8 s and a full scale current velocity of 4 92 m s a modified bem model was presented and coupled with linear and non linear wave theories to account for surface waves and yaw misalignment effects a validation study with previous experimental and numerical work was performed and very good agreements were obtained from linear wave theory results ensuring that the numerical model and its corrections were accurately implemented the results of fifth order model were more realistic than those of linear wave theory taking in consideration the effects of current on wave properties so it was implemented in the parametric study comparing with the wave period the variation effects of inflow current velocity and wave height have a significant influence on the dynamic loadings the presence of yaw misalignment has led to the increase of frequency oscillations on both the bending moments furthermore the reduction in the in plane bending moments due to rotor yawing has higher values at high and steep waves respectively of up to 37 of their median loadings due to rotor yawing however the reductions in the in plane bending moment increase with the current velocities increase the ratio of reduction to its median value has higher values at lower velocities this was attributed to the increase of median loading resulted from current velocity increase depending on the same reason the maximum loading ranges due to wave height period and current velocity variation were seen at the lowest velocity a maximum loading ranges of 233 and 146 of the median out of plane and in plane bending moments respectively were observed at 2 86 s wave period 0 2 m wave height and 0 7 m s current velocity the corresponding full scale parameters for these values are 12 8 s wave period 4 m wave height and 3 08 m s current velocity respectively maximum loadings of more than the double and almost one time and half of the median out of plane and of the in plane bending moments respectively are considered very high loadings which must be taken in consideration the effect of hub immersion depth variation was investigated at different flow and wave conditions hub immersion reduction was found to have minor effects on the dynamic loading ranges in the ordinary wave and flow conditions the same behavior was also observed even with increasing the inflow current velocity while a higher influence was seen by increasing the wave height consequently maximum gained increase of 20 and 12 9 of the median out of plane and in plane bending moments respectively were obtained due to wave height increase the excessive increase in the turbine rotational speed resulted in a significant increase in the in plane bending moment frequency oscillations which in turn affects the quality of electricity production these dynamic loading behaviors resulted from the variation of operational conditions wave parameters and inflow variables must be taken in consideration at the design stage of the turbine to avoid rotor failures furthermore the proper evaluation of the dynamic loadings enables developers for the best selection of tidal sites where excessive powerful environments should be avoid 5 future work however lust et al 2013 has reported that the induced velocities from waves are multiple orders of magnitude larger than those induced from turbulence the turbulence effects in wave current environments need further investigations as the present study introduced an evaluation of the response of the dynamic loads to the variation of operational geometric and inflow conditions the effect of turbulence was not taken in consideration so besides the wave current interaction effects the turbulence effect on the resulted hydrodynamic loading on the tidal turbines should be studied to properly mimic the actual environments where the tidal turbines be installed a future study will be performed to include the turbulence effects besides wave current interaction effects and compare it with the present results

21710,in the present work a parameter study across a range of intrinsic wave periods wave heights current velocities hub immersion depths yaw misalignments and tip speed ratios on the dynamic behavior of blade root bending moments has been performed for evaluating the dynamic loading a modified unsteady blade element momentum bem model was prepared and coupled with linear and non linear wave theories firstly a validation study with previous experimental and numerical work was performed fifth order model gave more realistic results taking in consideration the effects of current on wave properties so the parameter study calculations were performed using the fifth order model the effect of varying wave period wave height and current velocity with and without the presence of yaw misalignment range on the response of root bending moments has been studied in addition the effects of tidal immersion depth variation at different flow conditions have been investigated also the bending moments behavior due to the change of tip speed ratio has been studied through investigating the effects of wave height wave period and current velocity variation in the presence of yaw misalignment range it has been observed that the in plane bending moments reduction over their median loading have a greater reduction at high wave heights and steep waves respectively furthermore yaw misalignment variation became more influential at higher velocities while the in plane bending moments reduction to average loadings had greater values at low velocities due to wave height and wave period increase the maximum loading ranges of 233 more than the double of the median out of plane bending moment and 146 of the median in plane bending moment were observed the submergence ratio reduction seemed to have minor effects even with increasing the current velocity while had a higher influence at increased wave heights also the excessive increase in the turbine rotational speed has caused a significant increase in the in plane bending moment frequency oscillations which in turn affects the quality of the electricity production keywords tidal current turbine unsteady bem model dynamic loading parametric study blade root bending moments non linear wave models 1 introduction tidal current power can be described as a highly density reliable and predictable renewable energy source it has been reported that an available tidal power of 95 and 61 3 twh year are available in the uk and china respectively the crown estate 2012 liu et al 2011 sites of high flow velocities are attractive to developers for maximizing the extraction power by the tidal current turbines tcts the pentland firth uk and east china sea channels are considered promising sites of tidal current power exploitation due to their high flow velocities that exceed 5 and 4 m s respectively liu et al 2011 draper et al 2014 the tidal turbines in such energetic sites with powerful waters experience high loads from both currents and waves which need to be correctly predicted the structural design of tct s devices must be gained from the proper quantification of the hydrodynamic loading resulted from turbulence surface waves and sheared flows milne et al 2010 2017 these loads accelerate fatigue occurrence which in turn leads to turbine failure the unsteady velocities induced by waves are multiple orders of magnitude larger than those imparted by flow turbulence lust et al 2013 to confirm the economic competition of tcts with other renewable energy systems it is crucial to guarantee the long term service life of turbine components through the characterization of dynamic loads that will result in decreasing the maintenance and repair costs as there are already examples of rotor failures have been reported shulman 2008 cbcnews 2010 2011 these failures occurred due to the improper estimation of the hydrodynamic loadings resulted in some energetic sites shulman 2008 cbcnews 2010 or the incorrect design of the turbine blades which was unsuitable for surviving these powerful environments cbcnews 2011 the first studies of tidal turbines were focused on the steady characteristics of performance behavior myers and bahaj 2006 bahaj et al 2007 batten et al 2007 recently there is a great interest in the turbine dynamic loading resulted from wave current interactions many experimental and numerical studies have investigated the dynamic behavior of turbine performance of scale model horizontal axis tcts immersed in towing and flume tanks to highlight the strong influence of surface waves lust et al 2013 gaurier et al 2013 guo et al 2018 luznik et al 2013 de jesus henriques et al 2014 it was reported that the mean values of both power and thrust coefficients in the presence of waves were identical to those predicted from cases of current only conditions gaurier et al 2013 used a scale model horizontal axis tct of 0 9 m rotor diameter in a flume tank with two wave periods 1 4 and 2 s and wave amplitudes of 0 08 and 0 14 m at a current velocity of 0 6 m s significant effects were observed due to wave presence through the resulted cyclic fluctuations on the turbine loads that reached 40 more than their mean values emphasizing the importance of considering wave current effects on the fatigue analysis for the structures of tidal turbine components a near value to this percentage was obtained in the study performed by guo et al 2018 of a 0 8 m rotor diameter scale model turbine immersed in a towing tank with towing velocity of 0 68 m s the fluctuation amplitudes of thrust and torque reached up to 50 of their mean values due to surface waves of 1 6 s wave period and 0 14 m wave height the average power coefficient cp in the case of current only conditions was 0 38 in the study performed by luznik et al 2013 that was conducted in a towing tank using a 0 46 m rotor diameter with a towing velocity of 0 6 m s the fluctuations in power coefficient due to surface wave of 1 78 s wave period and 0 076 m wave height were in the range of 0 25 cp 0 45 besides to waves the effects of tidal immersion depth has been studied by lust et al 2013 in a towing tank utilizing a scale model of 0 8 m diameter and towing velocity of 1 68 m s it was reported that a significant increase in the rotor power and thrust was observed due to reducing the tidal immersion from z d 2 25 to z d 1 3 where z is the vertical coordinate which has a value of zero at the water free surface and d is the turbine rotor diameter similar findings were reported by the study performed by milne et al 2010 where a significant effect of the hub immersion depth variation on the out of plane bending moment was observed opposite results were reported from the study conducted by nevalainen et al 2016 where the immersion depth change was observed to have minor effects the effects of flow direction in the presence of waves have been investigated by martinez et al 2018 utilizing a 1 2 m rotor diameter scale model turbine in a circular basin where it was subjected to combined waves and current the power and thrust coefficients were measured at wave properties of 2 s wave period and 0 102 m wave height on a current velocity of 0 8 m s at yaw angles of 0 10 and 20 it was reported that the presence of waves at a yaw angle of 0 has resulted in an increase in the standard deviation of thrust and torque reached to the double of the cases of current only conditions the measurements performed by evans 2014 and easton 2013 at two actual sites have confirmed that the inflow direction can deviate with an angle up to 20 relative to the main flow direction between flood and ebb conditions this range was used for adjusting the range of yaw misalignment investigated in the present study for investigating the variation effect of many input parameters on the eccentric rotor load pattern and out of plane bending moments a sensitivity analysis on a numerical tct model was performed by nevalainen 2016 where a single input parameter was varied and the other parameters were kept constant the most influential parameters were the current velocity wave height wave period rotor radius current shear and blade pitch while the submergence ratio and blade geometry had a minor influence within the investigated ranges barltrop et al 2006 investigated the influence of waves on the hydrodynamic loading of blade root bending moments of a three bladed 0 35 m rotor diameter of a horizontal axis tct experimentally and numerically the experiments were performed in a towing tank where the turbine was towed with a fixed speeds varied from 0 3 to 1 m s the wave frequencies wave heights and rotational speed were varied to investigate its effects on the resulted dynamic loading it was observed that due to the presence of waves the amplitudes of blade root in plane and out of plane bending moments were increased by 100 and 50 respectively with loading fluctuation ranges of 200 and 67 to their mean values respectively this study was extended by the same researchers barltrop et al 2007 where additional experimental and numerical study was performed by using another scale model of increased rotor diameter of 0 4 m for increasing the rotor thrust and torque the experiments were conducted in the same towing tank for investigating the influence of wave parameters on the predicted rotor torque and thrust where a parametric study was introduced it was reported that the rotor torque was increased due to the presence of waves at low current velocities while the mean thrust remains unaffected also at low wave frequencies the change in wave height has a significant influence in the rotor torque and thrust an increase in the rotational speed of the rotor was found to cause a considerable increase in the mean thrust and torque the performance characteristics due to the presence of waves and yaw misalignment were studied through an experimental study on a three bladed horizontal axis tct of 1 0 m rotor diameter by galloway et al 2010 the turbine was immersed in a towing tank where it was towed with a fixed speed of 1 5 m s due to surface waves the thrust and torque were fluctuated around the mean values of ranges 37 and 35 respectively the effects of yaw misalignment were also investigated where a reduction in power of 20 was reported at yaw angle of 22 5 galloway et al 2014 performed further experimental and numerical investigations using another scale model of rotor diameter of 0 8 m in a towing tank where the turbine was towed with a fixed speed of 0 9 m s the experiments were conducted at two immersion depths where the wave frequencies of 0 75 0 5 and 0 35 hz and wave heights of 0 1 m and 0 15 m respectively were used it was reported that due to the presence of waves and yaw misalignment the cyclic fluctuation ranges of blade root out of plane and in plane bending moments were in the order of 175 and 100 respectively of its mean values the loading ranges of bending moments to their median values that were reported by barltrop et al 2006 are significantly different from those predicted by galloway et al 2014 that was attributed to the differences of the turbines geometries and wave parameters that were implemented in the two experiments also the high loading amplitude of in plane bending moment of 200 of the mean value which was reported by barltrop et al 2006 was attributed to the use of very heavy blades that formed approximately 50 of the average in plane bending moment in regard to the numerical models that have been used for calculating the induced wave velocities the majority of previous numerical studies that used the bem model for evaluating the dynamic loading behavior of tcts utilized linear wave theory barltrop et al 2006 2007 faudot and dahlhaug 2012 lust et al 2013 galloway et al 2014 guo et al 2018 draycott et al 2019 the main problem of linear wave theory is that the current effects on wave are not accounted for where the current velocity is simply superimposed to the horizontal wave particle velocities some studies have reported that linear wave theory results were unreliable through studying the wave current interaction strokosz 1987 has reported that the dynamic loading resulted by using linear wave theory are inaccurate and may be under predicted or over predicted furthermore zheng et al 2008 performed experimental investigations on the vertical characteristics of current velocity profiles in a flume in the presence of wave and current it was observed that the resulted current profiles from experimental data and linear wave theory were different barltrop et al 2006 reported that in steep waves the linear wave theory under predicted the bending moments furthermore by reducing the tidal immersion depth and increasing the wave periods in the study conducted by galloway et al 2014 the linear wave theory under predicted the out of plane bending moments due to the shortcomings of linear wave theory a non linear third order model developed by kishida and sobey 1988 and fifth order model developed by fenton 1985 are coupled with the modified bem model for predicting the hydrodynamic loadings in the present study in light of above a more expanded parametric study than that performed by barltrop et al 2007 is implemented where a numerical investigation of the variation effects of wave height wave period hub immersion depth yaw misalignment rotational speed and current velocity are presented these parameters shown in table 1 were selected due to its significant influence in the dynamic loadings the wave height and period were found to have great effects as reported by barltrop et al 2007 gaurier et el 2013 luznik et al 2013 galloway et al 2014 nevalainen et al 2016 and guo et al 2018 also similar effects were observed for the hub immersion depth milne et al 2010 lust et al 2013 the effect of yaw misalignment was found to have also significant effects martinez et al 2018 galloway et al 2010 2014 moreover the variation effect of current velocity and turbine rotational speed were found to have considerable effects on the resulted loadings barltrop et al 2007 so a deeper and expanded investigation is required for studying the effect of the combined change of these parameters with each other to provide the reader with a better understanding of the behavior of out of plane and in plane bending moments this study is expected to be important for the tcts in the structural design stage for quantifying the resulted hydrodynamic loadings the rotor geometry data of galloway et al 2014 shown in table 2 is used though this numerical study where the 1 20 scale model turbine is a froude scaled to be representative of a full scale 16 m rotor diameter tct immersed in a tidal depth of 37 m the wave parameters and current velocity were numerically modeled and chosen to be representative of a maximum full scale wave height of 4 m wave period of 12 8 s and current velocity of 4 92 m s the ranges of the investigated parameters are shown in table 1 firstly a validation study between the experimental and numerical data of galloway et al 2014 and the present numerical model is presented through this validation an advanced unsteady bem model coupled with wave theories is used for predicting the dynamic loading besides linear wave theory third order and fifth order models are coupled with the modified bem model the results of the three wave theories are assessed and accordingly one model is used in the investigation of parameters variation influence 2 mathematical model 2 1 modified unsteady bem model the bem model coupled with linear and non linear wave theories have been used in this study for evaluating the dynamic loading resulted from wave current flow field actually the classical bem model with its assumptions is not capable of achieving this task and must include some modifications firstly the steady bem model must be corrected to count for three dimensional 3 d losses at blade tip and hub also stall delay angle of attack extrapolation and high loading corrections must be included secondly the bem model must count the elemental dynamic loads at blade rotation at each azimuthal position as the inflow current velocity no longer be deemed as uniform so it must be changed as a function of azimuth angle that in turn is changed to time besides dynamic stall correction must be included in the modified bem model to count for elemental lift coefficient and angle of attack corrections furthermore dynamic inflow correction must be inserted due to the inertial response of the rotor the modified bem model is performed in successive subroutines firstly the rotor geometry lift and drag coefficients with the corresponding angle of attack axial and tangential force coefficients axial and tangential induction factors tip and hub loss corrections are fed in an iterative procedure with the convergence of angle of attack the calculated wave velocities are also added to the iterative procedures in case of yawed flow rotor misalignment to the inflow current skewed axial flow correction should also be included due to the two dimensional 2 d flow assumptions of the bem theory the radial flow losses at blade tip and hub were not accounted for thus the accuracy of the theory was affected therefore glauert 1935 presented a correction factor to be implemented at the tip while moriarty and hansen 2005 proposed a similar expression as a correction factor at the hub the lift and drag coefficients were generated by xfoil code drela 1989 as 2 d coefficients so the 3 d flow effects were not taken in consideration the 3 d stall delay correction was applied to the lift coefficient by using du and selig 2000 model while eggars hansen 2004 model was used for correcting the drag coefficient because of the high range of inflow angles the predicted angles of attack range by xfoil may be exceeded so viterna and corrigan 1982 methodology extrapolated the lift and drag coefficients at a high range of angles of attack 180 at high loading conditions the bem theory fails and reverse flow was obtained the thrust coefficient was under estimated due to the assumptions of the stream tube model of no flow interactions with the control volume buhl 2005 correction was introduced through improving glauert s model yielding a smooth transition from glauert parabola to the classical bemt prediction chapman et al 2013 the bem model coupled with wave theory cannot be used directly for evaluating the dynamic loading generated from wave current flow field and yaw misalignment effects as it must contain some modifications and correction models due to the wave effects and blade rotation the elemental azimuthal position be very substantial and should be taken into account as the inflow current cannot be considered as uniform as a result the dynamic loading for each rotor blade must be calculated individually as the inflow current seen by one blade is different from the others due to the difference in azimuthal positions fig 1 presents the rotor geometry with illustration of the yaw misalignment and azimuthal rotation as shown in the figure ω is the angular velocity of the rotor ψ is the azimuthal angle r is the local elemental radius γ is the yaw angle of the upstream flow χ is the skew angle of the wake and u o is the inflow current velocity that be considered positive if it is in the same direction of wave propagation and negative it is in the opposite direction for modelling wave velocity by the wave theories and including azimuthal positions for each blade element and yaw misalignment the problem must be function on time time as a function of blade element azimuthal angle in the presence of yaw effects is calculated from eq 1 1 t i ψ r λ u o r sin ψ sin γ u o where λ is the tip speed ratio tsr and r is the radius of the rotor the second part of eq 1 is the resulted time because of yaw misalignment the tip speed ratio can be calculated from eq 2 2 λ ω r u o due to the acquired oscillations from surface waves the hydrodynamic coefficients predicted by xfoil as well as the corresponding angles of attack need to be modified also the time lagged response of the rotor inertia to flow dynamic conditions is highly recommended to be corrected so two correction models dynamic stall and dynamic inflow models are included in the unsteady modified bem model 2 2 dynamic stall correction lift coefficients and its corresponding angles of attack are strongly recommended to be corrected due to dynamic stall effects which result from the continuous fluctuations in the inflow velocity blade rotation and surface waves are the main sources of angle of attack oscillations that in turn lead to inflow velocity fluctuations in the current work boeing vertol model tarzanin 1972 containing an empirical time domain coefficient as a tuning parameter is employed within the modified unsteady bem model performing dynamic stall model is not an easy task because it relies on the previous change rate of the angle of attack α so an additional complete run must be performed for that purpose changes of elemental angle of attack and lift coefficients due to implementing dynamic stall model can be calculated from eqs 3 and 4 3 α d α a 1 c α 2 u α α 4 c l d c l 0 c l α d c l 0 α d α where c l and α are the elemental lift coefficient and angle of attack respectively a1 is an empirical time domain coefficient subscript d refers to the dynamic stall correction and α is the change rate of azimuthal angles of attack 2 3 dynamic inflow correction according to steady bem theory an increase in the flow velocity must be directly accompanied with an immediate increase in the rotor power in reality this instantaneous response of the rotor cannot occur due to the inertial response of the system there is a continuous variation in the inflow velocity due to surface waves yaw misalignment effects and flow turbulence which in turn lead to time lagged response because of the rotor blades inertia to account for rotor inertial response pitt and peters 1981 have introduced what is called dynamic inflow correction burton et al 2011 has described the total axial force on a disc by using eq 5 where the coefficient c t d was used to describe the contribution of the dynamic acceleration that must be added to the total thrust coefficient 5 f x 0 5 ρ u 2 π r 2 c t d galloway et al 2014 implemented burton s definition of the dynamic acceleration addition that accounts for the system losses for developing pitt and peters 1981 dynamic inflow model to introduce a new model for calculating blade dynamic bending moments in the present study the dynamic inflow model proposed by galloway et al 2014 was implemented in the unsteady bem model as shown from eqs 6 8 dynamic out of plane bending moment m x d consists of steady and relative out of plane bending moments m x is the out of plane bending moment resulted from steady bem model while m x r e l accounts for the contribution of dynamic acceleration calculated through the coefficient c x d for dynamic in plane bending moment m y d it can be calculated by using the same method where gravitational moment component is added to the steady and relative in plane bending moments for more details about this model the reader is referred to galloway s paper 6 m x d m x m x r e l 7 m x 0 5 ρ w 2 c r r c x 8 m x r e l 0 5 ρ u 2 r 3 π c

coupled with the modified bem model for validating the present numerical model with the experimental data of galloway et al 2014 due to the drawbacks of linear wave theory that were mentioned in the literature two non linear wave theories third order and fifth order models are coupled also with the modified unsteady bem model the results from the three models will be assessed through a validation study to reveal the reliable model that will be used in the parametric study in the following subsections a brief summary about linear wave theory third order and fifth order models are introduced 2 4 1 linear wave theory linear wave theory describes the kinematics and dynamics of wave propagation linearly it assumes that the fluid flow is inviscid incompressible and irrotational having a uniform tidal depth in tidal turbines the wave theory is implemented for calculating the wave particle velocities at each blade element position so the wave velocity equations are dependent on time and elemental azimuthal position linear wave uses the velocity potential to describe the motion of waves the velocity potential horizontal and vertical wave particle velocities are calculated through the eqs 9 11 9 φ u x h 2 ω r cosh k d z i sinh k d sin k x r ω r t i 10 u r φ x u h 2 ω r cosh k d z i sinh k d cos k x r ω r t i 11 w r φ z h 2 ω r sinh k d z i sinh k d sin k x r ω r t i where d is the water depth k is the wave number h is the wave height t i is the time instant x r is the stream wise distance in the direction of wave propagation and z i is the vertical position for each blade element that can be calculated according to the tidal depth and azimuth angle from the following equation 12 z i z h r cos ψ where z h represents the rotor hub immersion depth in actual sites the turbine is fixed so the doppler shift occurs due to the moving reference frame as a result the particle wave velocities are superimposed to the inflow current velocity hedges et al 1985 iso 2005 as shown in eq 10 due to doppler shift the wave period differs accordingly for a stationary reference frame the wave period is apparent t a while for a moving reference frame the wave period is intrinsic or relative t i as a result the wave frequency is classified into apparent ω a and relative ω r where ω a ω r k u hedges et al 1985 the dispersion relation that connect the angular wave frequency wave number and tidal depth for linear wave theory is shown in the following equation 13 ω r g k tanh k d 2 4 2 third order model for investigating a higher order interaction between propagating steady waves on a linear shear current kishida and sobey 1988 presented a modified third order stokes theory based on k h 2 as the expansion parameter a constant vorticity is imposed for the linear shear current and as a result the wave motion remains irrotational a moving reference frame has the same speed as wave speed c with coordinates x and z located at the sea bed where the wave motion is assumed to be two dimensional inviscid and steady from both current surface velocity u s and bottom velocity u b the mean eulerian current u m and current vorticity ω o are calculated according to eqs 14 and 15 14 u m u s u s u b 2 15 ω 0 u s u b d where the current surface velocity was obtained by using the 1 7th power law the dispersion relation for this model was defined by using eq 16 which was solved iteratively by using newton raphson method for calculating the unknown wave number k 16 g k tanh k d 0 5 a 11 k h 2 2 a 20 u m 1 2 ω 0 k c 0 d c 0 where c is the wave speed and the coefficients

0 is the airy wave speed by the use of perturbation expansion and euler equation the solution of the third order stokes on a linear shear current was introduced according to the moving reference frame through the stream function as shown in eq 18 the horizontal and vertical wave particle velocities were derived from the stream function as u r ψ z and w r ψ x 18 ψ c 0 k a 00 k z a 01 k z 2 ε a 11

listed in the stream function equation must be transmitted relative to the fixed reference frame through eqs 19 and 20 19 x x c t 20 z z where x and z are the fixed reference frame coordinates 2 4 3 fifth order stokes theory a higher order governing potential velocity equation is needed to model highly turbulent waves that are near to the breaking point a fifth order stokes theory was derived by fenton 1985 where the dimensionless wave height kh 2 was considered as the expansion parameter for the perturbation expansion of the fourier series this expansion inserted a detailed set of expansion parameters that are used in the equations of the particle wave theories more details can be obtained from the paper fenton 1985 this model assumes periodic steady propagating waves where a moving reference frame is considered having the same velocity of waves c and coordinates of x and y positioned in the sea bed also a stationary reference frame is considered with coordinates of x and y the transformation from the stationary to the moving reference frame occurs according to eqs 21 and 22 21 x x c t 22 y y according to the moving reference frame the time averaged eulerian current velocity c e is obtained by eq 23 23 c e c u where u is the mean current velocity the dispersion relation that relates the wave parameters is introduced as follows 24 c 0 ε 2 c 2 ε 4 c 4 u k g 1 2 0 where ε k h 2 is the expansion parameter which the coefficients of c 0 c 2 and c 4 are dependent on as mentioned before these coefficients can be obtained from fenton s paper eq 24 can be solved by iteration through newton raphson method for the unknown wave number according to the moving reference frame the velocity potential is given according to eq 25 the velocity potential is transferred to the fixed reference frame by using the eqs 21 and 22 to include the time domain 25 φ x y u x c 0 g k 3 1 2 i 1 5 ε i j 1 i a i j cosh j k y sin j k x the a i j constants are given in fenton s paper the horizontal and vertical particle wave velocities are calculated from the velocity potential equation by u r φ x and w r φ y 2 5 additional modifications due to waves and yaw misalignment due to the inclusion of waves in the bem model the relative flow velocity was corrected through modifying the inflow angle at each elemental azimuthal position according to eq 26 by modifying inflow angle the angle of attack and the corresponding lift and drag coefficients are changed accordingly as a result the axial and tangential force coefficients and their dependent parameters such as axial tangential induction factors power and thrust coefficients are changed 26 tan ϕ u r 1 a ω r 1 a w r where a and a are the axial and tangential induction factors respectively due to skewed wake the axial induction factor must be modified accordingly at each blade element the implementation of this correction in the modified bem model has caused contradictions in both out of plane and in plane bending moments when validated with experimental results during the study that has performed by galloway et al 2014 so the correction of axial induction factor was omitted in the current modified bem model yaw misalignment are included in the calculations of axial and tangential force coefficients respectively as shown in eqs 27 and 28 27 c x c l cos ϕ c d sin ϕ cos γ 28 c y c l sin ϕ c d cos ϕ cos 2 γ where c l c d are lift and drag coefficients respectively 3 results and discussion firstly a validation study was presented though comparing the results of the modified bem model coupled with wave theories with previous experimental and numerical data to assess the accuracy and reliability of the present numerical work then a parametric study was performed for getting a better understanding of the dynamic loading behavior of a horizontal axis tct through presenting the response of blade root bending moments to a range of flow conditions 3 1 validation study for validating the present numerical work a modified unsteady bem model was prepared and modified according to the corrections that previously mentioned in sections 2 1 2 2 and 2 3 galloway et al 2014 work was simulated by using the modified bem model coupled with linear wave theory third order and fifth order models the results were validated with galloway s experimental and numerical data the resulted dynamic loading of blade root out of plane and in plane bending moments from wave properties of 2 s intrinsic wave period and wave height of 0 1 m on a current velocity of 0 9 m s were presented in figs 2 and 3 fig 2 shows the out of plane bending moment where the results of the linear wave theory was compared with galloway s experimental and numerical work in the upper graph while the third order and fifth order results were presented in the lower graph and compared with galloway s experimental data the present numerical results of linear wave theory outweighed galloway s numerical work and showed a very good agreement with the experimental results for the out of plane bending moments resulted from the third order and fifth order models it differed from the experimental results in loading phase and frequency but had a relatively equal ultimate loading range by comparing the loading range of non linear models and linear wave theory it was found that non linear models had slightly higher loading ranges the differences between experimental work and the non linear models are attributed to the absence of current in galloway s experimental work where the turbine was mounted on a carriage and towed with a fixed speed to represent the current velocity so the current effect on the wave field was not accounted for in the experiments for linear wave theory the current velocity was superimposed to the horizontal wave particle velocity and its effects on the waves were not also taken in consideration so the linear wave theory results have a good agreement with the experimental data on the other hand the third order and fifth order models took in consideration the effects of current on wave properties as shown in their stream function and velocity potential relations resulting in dynamic loading differed in wave length and phase from the experimental and linear wave theory results the increased wave length in case of both third order and fifth order models due to the presence of a following current in the same direction of wave propagation was also confirmed by previous studies brevik and bjørn 1979 wolf and prandle 1999 zaman 2008 it is seen that the both models have the same loading wave length and almost the loading range the third order model results had more loading oscillations all over the time range comparing with experimental and fifth order data that may be attributed to considering the current shear instead of uniform current velocity for in plane bending moment results shown in fig 3 linear wave theory showed a reasonable agreement in loading frequency and amplitude comparing with galloway s experimental and numerical data the results of third order and fifth order models also differed in loading phase and frequency resulted in a little higher loading ranges comparing with the experimental results the average out of plane and in plane bending moments over the rotor blades resulted from the third order and fifth order models were compared as shown in fig 4 it is obvious that the average bending moments are identical in loading phase frequency and range which ensures the confidence and accuracy of the results obtained from the both models at fig 5 the resulted out of plane bending moment was presented at a 2 86 s wave period at the same wave height and current velocity of the previous comparison with yaw angle of 15 the results of linear wave theory showed a better agreement with experimental data comparing with galloway s numerical study for the high wave period of 2 86 s in this case the third order model failed to solve the dispersion relation indicating the incapability of the model of solving the wave current field at high wave periods fifth order model as a higher order non linear wave theory could solving the dispersion relation resulting in a higher wave length comparing with linear wave theory and experimental results the dynamic loading of out of plane bending moment resulted from fifth order model differed in phase and frequency from the experimental data but had a slightly lower loading range for the validation study due to the agreements between the experimental data and the present modified bem model coupled with linear wave theory it could be concluded that the modified unsteady bem model its corrections and linear wave theory were accurately applied and implemented in the current numerical study it could be seen that the present modified bem model coupled with linear wave theory has surpassed galloway s numerical model in predicting out of plane and in plane bending moments that may be attributed to the accuracy of the steady bem model which greatly affects the unsteady model results the steady bem model relies on the 2 d lift and drag coefficients which were predicted by xfoil code in both the present and galloway s studies these coefficients should be calculated at the proper chord based reynolds numbers and turbulence transition parameters ncrit otherwise the steady bem model will be significantly affected el shahat et al 2020 furthermore the implemented corrections of the steady bem model mentioned in section 2 1 also affect the model accuracy koh and ng 2016 masters at al 2011 all these parameters affect the steady bem model and hence the modified bem model and its results so the poor prediction of galloway s numerical model may be attributed to one of the mentioned reasons it is observed also that the out of plane bending moments predicted by galloway s model are more affected than in plane bending moments that is due to the high values of the axial force coefficients that affect the out of plane bending moments comparing with the low values of the tangential force coefficients which in turn lead to minor effects on the in plane bending moments the third order and fifth order models accounted for current effects on wave properties and gave more realistic results than linear wave theory at high wave periods the third order model failed to solve the wave current field so the fifth order model was considered the best choice at low and high wave periods taking in consideration the current effects on wave field so it is implemented in the parameter study that is presented in the following section many blockage corrections were applied to the data of the tct model by galloway et al 2014 however the final results were not satisfactory finally depending on the low value of blockage ratio 7 the correction was neglected galloway et al 2014 many previous studies where turbine model experiments were performed having blockage ratios of 6 and 6 3 respectively without correcting for blockage effects ordonez sanchez et al 2010 myers and bahaj 2009 furthermore the numerical study of turner and owen 2009 showed that blockage ratios larger than 7 8 have significant influence on the turbine power coefficient cp for lower ratios the blockage was seen to have minor effects for the turbine model of galloway et al 2014 the power and thrust coefficients were predicted by the present steady bem model the power and thrust were predicted accurately and a very good agreement was obtained as shown in fig 6 according to gaurier et al 2015 the blockage mainly influence the turbine performance curves at high tsrs when the thrust coefficient is high for the present case the differences between the experimental and bem model results of the power and thrust coefficients shown in fig 6 at high tsrs are not big at tsr 7 the bem model over predicted the power with up to 3 while under estimated the thrust with up to 2 comparing with the experimental data depending on the low discrepancies between the experimental and numerical results the blockage effects are believed to have limited effects on the results so it has been neglected in the present study 3 2 effects of wave period and wave height with the presence of yaw misalignment range yaw misalignment range in the study conducted by martinez et al 2018 was from 0 to 20 while the range was increased up to 22 5 in the studies performed by galloway et al 2010 and 2014 so in the present investigations the range of yaw angles was extended to be from 0 to 25 the effect of changing wave properties of intrinsic wave period and wave height with the change of yaw misalignment angles on the resulted dynamic loading is presented in fig 7 in this comparison the effect of increasing both the wave periods from 1 33 to 2 86 s and the wave heights from 0 1 to 0 2 m in the presence of yaw angle range from 0 to 25 is investigated it is clear that the increase of wave periods and wave heights lead to dynamic loading range increase while the wave height is dominant over the wave period and had a higher influence due to the increase of wave height from 0 1 to 0 2 m at a current velocity of 0 9 m s the out of plane bending moments fluctuated with significant amplitudes of 92 and 90 8 of their mean values at wave periods of 2 86 and 1 33 s respectively for in plane bending moments the fluctuation amplitudes were up to 60 8 and 56 of their mean values generally at all wave periods and heights it is observed that the presence of yaw misalignment has led to the increase of dynamic frequency oscillations for both out of plane and in plane bending moments yaw misalignments have caused a remarkable reduction in the median loading of in plane bending moments while had a slight reduction in case of out of plane bending moment this is attributed to the axial and tangential force coefficients calculated from eqs 27 and 28 where the effect of yaw cos γ is squared in case of tangential force coefficient leading to a higher reduction than the axial force coefficient the in plane bending moment reduction due to yawing the rotor with an angle of 25 at 1 33 and 2 86 s wave periods and wave heights of 0 1 and 0 2 m is shown in fig 8 it is observed that the in plane bending moment has a higher reduction at wave height of 0 2 m than at 0 1 m at the same wave period furthermore the in plane bending moment has a higher reduction at steep waves than at long waves a reduction percentage up to 37 of the in plane bending moment to median loading was observed at wave period of 1 33 s and wave height of 0 2 m while the reduction percentage at wave period of 2 86 s was 33 2 at the same conditions at fig 7 the in plane bending moment reduction due to yaw misalignments at the wave period of 2 86 s may seem higher than lower wave period of 1 33 s the graphs of low wave period are very steep so the differences are higher than what it look like from this comparison it can be concluded that a greater reduction in the turbine power comparing with thrust is expected due to yaw misalignment effects this reduction in the power becomes more influential at high wave heights and steep waves 3 3 effects of current velocity with the presence of yaw misalignment range at a fixed wave period and height the effect of current velocity variation in the presence of yaw misalignment range is shown in fig 9 the effect of velocity increase from 0 9 to 1 1 m s in a range of yaw angles from 0 to 25 is discussed according to eq 1 the increase of inflow current velocity leads to the decrease of time range so as shown in fig 9 in the cases of current velocity of 1 1 m s the time range was reduced the current velocity has a significant influence on dynamic loading ranges and their median values but has a lower effect on the loading wave length according to the dispersion relation of fifth order model eqs 23 and 24 increasing the current velocity affects the wave number and hence the wave length so it is observed that the increase of current velocity from 0 9 to 1 1 m s has resulted in an increase in the dynamic loading wave length from 8 7 to 9 23 m furthermore without yaw misalignment effects an increase of 51 and 50 of the median out of plane and in plane bending moments have been resulted due to the increase of current velocity from 0 9 to 1 1 m s due to this increase in the median loading of the bending moments the dynamic loading range over the median loading has been reduced from 94 to 77 for the out of plane bending moment and from 59 to 47 in case of in plane bending moment as shown in fig 9 it is clear that the corresponding reductions in the in plane bending moment to yaw angles of 15 20 and 25 in case of current velocity of 1 1 m s are higher than the reductions at lower current velocity of 0 9 m s the in plane bending moment reduction due to yaw misalignment angle of 25 at current velocity of 1 1 m s has led to in plane bending moment reduction up to 0 9 nm while at current velocity of 0 9 m s the in plane bending moment reduction was up to 0 65 nm so it can be said that yaw misalignment becomes more influential at higher current velocities however the ratio of in plane bending moment reduction to median loading is higher in case of lower current velocity of 0 9 m s this is attributed to the increase of median loading due to the increase of current velocity fig 10 shows the in plane bending moment reduction to the median loading corresponding to yaw misalignment angle of 25 at both current velocities of 0 9 and 1 1 m s respectively for current velocity of 1 1 m s the in plane bending moment reduction is 24 of its median loading while this ratio has increased up to 26 3 at lower current velocity of 0 9 m s 3 4 effects of combined change in current velocity wave period and wave height fig 11 shows the dynamic behavior of the out of plane and in plane bending moments to the change of wave periods wave heights and current velocities the intrinsic wave period and wave height have increased from 1 33 to 2 86 s and from 0 1 to 0 2 m respectively in a current velocity range from 0 7 to 1 1 m s according to the first part of eq 1 of time instant without yaw misalignment increasing the current velocity will cause a significant decrease to the time range so through the 30 performed revolutions of turbine rotor a large time range was obtained at current velocity of 0 7 m s while small time ranges were obtained at higher current velocities of 0 9 and 1 1 m s so a common time range from 2 2 to 11 4 s as shown in fig 11 was selected and set for the three current velocities at the present comparison it was observed that the increase of current velocity has a significant effect on the bending moments amplitudes where both the bending moments have a considerable increase due to the increase of current velocity in addition flow conditions of increased current velocity v 1 1 m s and high wave heights h 0 2 m had the maximum dynamic fluctuating range around the median value as shown in fig 11 on the other hand a significant increase in the bending moments wave length was resulted due to the increase of wave period the resulted increase of dynamic loading wave length due to the increase of wave period was higher than the resulted due to current velocity increase inferring that the effect of wave period on the wave length of the dynamic loading is dominant over the current velocity furthermore the increase of wave periods have resulted in a relatively small increase in the dynamic loading amplitudes comparing with the resulted loading amplitudes due to current velocity increase also it was observed that the increase of wave period has led to a significant increase in the frequency oscillations of the in plane bending moments for all the wave heights and current velocities these oscillations have detrimental effects on the tcts where the quality of the output power is significantly affected similar results were also confirmed by the results of nevalainen et al 2016 where a significant increase in the loading ranges of out of plane bending moments was observed due to the inflow current and wave height increase also the wave period was found to have a great effect on the loading wave length additional graphs figs 12 and 13 are added to provide more details about the effect of increasing both current velocity and wave period on the dynamic behavior of both out of plane and in plane bending moments in the presence of wave height range of 0 1 0 2 m the loading ranges over the median loads of both out of plane and in plane bending moments were drawn versus the current velocity for different wave periods and wave heights as shown in figs 12 and 13 for both bending moment graphs it can be seen that the loading ranges to their median values have maximum values at low current velocities that is attributed to the resulted high median loading values at high current velocities it can also be observed that the fluctuating loading range to the median load increases with increasing the wave heights and wave periods at fixed current velocities for out of plane bending moment the maximum loading ranges of 233 213 and 212 to their median values were seen at wave periods of 2 86 2 and 1 33 s respectively on a current velocity of 0 7 m s at these conditions the maximum in plane bending moment loading ranges of 146 141 and 119 to their median loadings were observed at higher current velocities of 0 9 and 1 1 m s the maximum out of plane bending moment loading ranges to their median values were seen at wave period of 2 s for in plane bending moment the matter is different where the maximum loading ranges to median values were obtained at wave period of 2 86 s for all current velocities it was observed also from figs 12 and 13 that the differences between bending moments to their median values due to wave period increase at the same wave height have higher values at lower current velocities than at higher current velocities especially in the in plane bending moment graphs from this comparison due to wave height and wave period increase the loading ranges to their median values reached maximum values of 233 and 146 of the out of pane and in plane bending moments respectively so the wave variation at tidal sites must be investigated carefully before the deployment stage this will be beneficial also for the proper selection of the structural design of the turbine through the quantification of the resulted hydrodynamic loads in these environments for avoiding rotor failures for the previous studies that investigated the effects of waves on the resulted dynamic loadings different cyclic fluctuations and loading ranges have been observed gaurier et al 2013 has reported that the fluctuation amplitudes of the turbine loads have reached 40 more than their mean values relatively lower percentages have been resulted in the study conducted by galloway et al 2010 where the thrust and torque were fluctuated around their mean values with ranges of 37 and 35 respectively comparing with these results higher fluctuating amplitudes were observed by guo et al 2018 the cyclic fluctuations of thrust and torque reached up to 50 of their mean values also it has been reported by barltrop et al 2006 that maximum loading ranges of out of plane and in plane bending moments of 200 and 67 to their mean values have been resulted different percentages of 175 and 100 of the out of plane and in plane bending moments respectively have been resulted in the study conducted by galloway et al 2014 in regard to the study conducted by martinez et al 2018 at a yaw angle of 0 an increase in the standard deviation of thrust and torque reached up to the double of the cases of current only conditions has been resulted from these percentages it is clear that there is a disparity in the resulted ranges of dynamic loads from a study to another this is attributed to the differences between these studies in operational geometric wave and inflow conditions to relate our results with the previous findings that mentioned in the literature it will be more suitable to relate it with the results of galloway et al 2014 as the data of the same tct model has been used in the present study galloway et al 2014 has reported that maximum loading ranges of 175 and 100 of the mean out of plane and in plane bending moments respectively have been observed at wave height and wave period of 0 1 m and 2 86 s respectively in the present study due to the wave height increase from 0 1 to 0 2 m the loading ranges of out of plane and in plane bending moments have reached up to 233 and 146 respectively of their mean values 3 5 effects of wave height at different wave periods at a fixed current velocity of 0 9 m s the effect of both wave height and period variation on the dynamic behavior of out of plane and in plane bending moments is presented in fig 14 it can be seen that the increase of wave height and wave period did not affect the median loading instead it influence the fluctuating range of both out of plane and in plane bending moments around their average values for the wave height effect on both the bending moments at all wave periods it significantly affects the dynamic loading range where a considerable increase was observed due to the increase of wave height on the other hand as shown in fig 14 the variation of wave height has a negligible effect on the wave length of the dynamic loading at the same wave period and current velocity due to the increase of wave period a significant increase on the loading wave length was observed while a slight increase in the loading amplitudes were resulted for the wave height range the maximum out of plane bending moment loading ranges to their median values were seen at wave period of 2 s while the maximum loading ranges of in plane bending moments to their median values were seen at wave period of 2 86 s the dynamic loading ranges to the median loadings of both out of plane and in plane bending moments are displayed in figs 15 and 16 for the bending moments it can be seen that the wave height has almost a linear relation with the dynamic loading ratio the maximum out of plane bending moment loading range of 185 to the average load was obtained at a wave period and wave height of 2 s and 0 2 m respectively at a wave period of 2 86 s the loading range to the median out of plane bending moment has a slightly lower values than at wave period of 2 s for in plane bending moment the matter is different where the maximum loading range of 111 relative to the median loading was observed at wave period and wave height of 2 86 s and 0 2 m respectively in the comparison of section 3 4 the maximum loading ranges to their median values were observed at the highest wave period of 2 86 s while here by increasing the current velocity the maximum out of plane loading appeared at wave period of 2 s that is attributed to the relatively lower augmentation values of loading ranges comparing with median loadings resulted from current velocity increase which in turn led to the decrease of these ratios accordingly for in plane loading ranges to median values the matter is different where the maximum loads appeared at the highest wave period of 2 86 s at all current velocities 3 6 effects of hub immersion depth reduction at different flow and wave conditions in regard to the effect of immersion depth reduction on the dynamic loadings many previous contradictory results have been reported in the study conducted by nevalainen et al 2016 it has been reported that immersion depth variation has a minor influence while the investigations performed by milne et al 2010 and lust et al 2013 have shown that it has a significant effect that may be attributed to the differences between these studies in operational geometric and inflow conditions so a deep investigation is required to study the effect of immersion depth variation on the resulted hydrodynamic loadings as a result in this part of results the effect of hub immersion depth variation on the dynamic loading behavior of out of plane and in plane bending moments has been investigated at different flow and wave conditions as shown in fig 17 by reducing the turbine hub immersion from 0 67 m to 1 13 m three submergence ratios z h d of 0 84 1 125 and 1 41 have been studied in this comparison firstly the submergence variation effect on a case of 2 s intrinsic wave period and wave height of 0 1 m on a 0 9 m s current velocity has been studied at these conditions it has been found that reducing the submergence ratio does not result in a significant increase in the dynamic loading range of both bending moments but instead has a relatively small effect within this comparison a second case was studied where the current velocity has been increased from 0 9 to 1 1 m s to study its effect on the dynamic loading in the presence of submergence ratio range due to increasing the current velocity according to eq 1 the time range has been reduced as shown in fig 17 the current velocity increase has resulted in dynamic loading range and amplitude increase while the same trend of the first case of reducing submergence ratio was seen where a small increase on both bending moments loading ranges around the median loadings was obtained a third case was presented though studying the effect of increasing wave height from 0 1 to 0 2 m in the presence of submergence ratio variation on the behavior of bending moments at a current velocity of 0 9 m s the dynamic fluctuation range of both bending moments around the median loading has been increased due to the wave height increase also it can be seen that the gained loading ranges due to the reduction of submergence ratio is significantly higher than those predicted from the previous two cases which indicating the considerable influence of submergence ratio reduction on the dynamic loading at high wave heights it is noticed also that the variation of submergence does not affect the median loading value but instead affects the dynamic loading range the gained bending moments to their median values resulted from reducing the submergence ratio from 1 41 to 0 84 and accompanied with increasing wave height from 0 1 to 0 2 m at current velocity of 0 9 m s are shown in fig 18a and 18 b respectively the maximum gained out of plane and in plane bending moments were increased up to 20 and 12 9 respectively of their mean values on the other hand with increasing current velocity from 0 9 to 1 1 m s the gained bending moments to their median values due to submergence ratio decrease were shown in fig 18c and 18 d the maximum gained out of plane and in plane bending moments to their median values were reduced up to 8 and 4 8 respectively these reductions are attributed to the median loading increase resulted from raising the current velocity from 0 9 to 1 1 m s 3 7 effects of tsr change generally at low tsr values tsr 4 the bem model struggles for conversion especially at elements near the blade root this feature is a common feature for bem codes not only for the present code at high tsrs the bem model becomes heavily dependent on the empirical corrections of high axial induction factors which affect the results accuracy if the correction is not suitable for the hydrofoil type to guarantee the convergence of the bem model for better agreements with the experimental data the turbine model experiments of galloway et al 2014 were performed at tsr range of 4 7 5 so in the present investigation the same tsr range was considered the intermediate value of 5 4 was selected because it represents the optimum tsr as reported by galloway et al 2014 and can be seen from fig 6 the present comparison was performed at fixed current velocity of 0 9 m s therefore the tsr was increased through increasing the rotor rotational speed the effect of tsr increase on the dynamic instantaneous and average loading of bending moments is presented in fig 19 the resulted instantaneous and average bending moments were displayed for tsr range from 4 to 7 5 in a 2 s wave period with a wave height of 0 1 m on a current velocity of 0 9 m s the corresponding rotational speed to the tsr values of 4 5 4 and 7 5 are 86 116 and 161 rpm respectively by increasing the tsr the median loadings of out of plane bending moments were found to be increased due to the greater rotor thrust the in plane bending moment median loadings were reduced due to the reduction in shaft torque at high tsrs similar findings were also reported from the study conducted by galloway et al 2014 according to the first part of eq 1 it can be noticed that the tsr increase leads to time reduction also from the velocity potential and stream functions of the wave models eqs 9 18 and 25 it can be observed that any change in the time leads to wave phase change as a result the three cases of the selected values for tsrs have resulted in a changed wave phase of the wave particle horizontal and vertical velocities and hence altering the resulted dynamic loading phase as shown in fig 19 for the three cases shown in fig 19 it can be observed that the dynamic loading range of out of plane bending moment has been increased due to the increase of tsr from 4 to 5 4 while was decreased at high tsr of 7 5 for the loading range of in plane bending moment it was found to be significantly decreased with increasing tsrs in addition another influence of tsr increase was observed in the increased frequency oscillations that appeared in both the bending moments especially the in plane bending moment at tsr 7 5 the increased frequency oscillations have a significant influence on the quality of the electrical power and causes flicker which may require advanced electronic devices for smoothing the output power so such operational conditions should be avoided 4 conclusions this paper introduces a parametric study across a range of parameters through modeling the dynamic behavior of blade root bending moments of a 1 20 scale model tidal turbine the model is a froude scaled to be representative of a full scale 16 m rotor diameter tct that is immersed in a tidal depth of 37 m the wave parameters and current velocity were numerically modeled and chosen to be representative of a maximum wave height of 4 m wave period of 12 8 s and a full scale current velocity of 4 92 m s a modified bem model was presented and coupled with linear and non linear wave theories to account for surface waves and yaw misalignment effects a validation study with previous experimental and numerical work was performed and very good agreements were obtained from linear wave theory results ensuring that the numerical model and its corrections were accurately implemented the results of fifth order model were more realistic than those of linear wave theory taking in consideration the effects of current on wave properties so it was implemented in the parametric study comparing with the wave period the variation effects of inflow current velocity and wave height have a significant influence on the dynamic loadings the presence of yaw misalignment has led to the increase of frequency oscillations on both the bending moments furthermore the reduction in the in plane bending moments due to rotor yawing has higher values at high and steep waves respectively of up to 37 of their median loadings due to rotor yawing however the reductions in the in plane bending moment increase with the current velocities increase the ratio of reduction to its median value has higher values at lower velocities this was attributed to the increase of median loading resulted from current velocity increase depending on the same reason the maximum loading ranges due to wave height period and current velocity variation were seen at the lowest velocity a maximum loading ranges of 233 and 146 of the median out of plane and in plane bending moments respectively were observed at 2 86 s wave period 0 2 m wave height and 0 7 m s current velocity the corresponding full scale parameters for these values are 12 8 s wave period 4 m wave height and 3 08 m s current velocity respectively maximum loadings of more than the double and almost one time and half of the median out of plane and of the in plane bending moments respectively are considered very high loadings which must be taken in consideration the effect of hub immersion depth variation was investigated at different flow and wave conditions hub immersion reduction was found to have minor effects on the dynamic loading ranges in the ordinary wave and flow conditions the same behavior was also observed even with increasing the inflow current velocity while a higher influence was seen by increasing the wave height consequently maximum gained increase of 20 and 12 9 of the median out of plane and in plane bending moments respectively were obtained due to wave height increase the excessive increase in the turbine rotational speed resulted in a significant increase in the in plane bending moment frequency oscillations which in turn affects the quality of electricity production these dynamic loading behaviors resulted from the variation of operational conditions wave parameters and inflow variables must be taken in consideration at the design stage of the turbine to avoid rotor failures furthermore the proper evaluation of the dynamic loadings enables developers for the best selection of tidal sites where excessive powerful environments should be avoid 5 future work however lust et al 2013 has reported that the induced velocities from waves are multiple orders of magnitude larger than those induced from turbulence the turbulence effects in wave current environments need further investigations as the present study introduced an evaluation of the response of the dynamic loads to the variation of operational geometric and inflow conditions the effect of turbulence was not taken in consideration so besides the wave current interaction effects the turbulence effect on the resulted hydrodynamic loading on the tidal turbines should be studied to properly mimic the actual environments where the tidal turbines be installed a future study will be performed to include the turbulence effects besides wave current interaction effects and compare it with the present results

usa s industries spend 200 billion dollars annually on their equipment maintenance which saves 60 billion dollars annually with proper management ghasemi and khodaverdi 2017 to achieve high reliability and superior safety performance there is a need for a proper r m plan in recent decades various strategies have been put forward to providing an appropriate r m plan such as reliable repair and maintenance and monitoring of conditions in the oil and gas industry pui et al 2017 bhandari et al 2016 abbassi et al 2016 as a result choosing a repair and maintenance policy is a multi criteria decision arunraj and maiti 2010 there are different ways to research this area according to studies most researchers have solved their problems using the fuzzy hierarchy method yazdi et al 2019 presented a risk based maintenance plan with the ahp technique and rbm method yazdi et al 2019 in their research motamed and majrouhi 2018 identified fifteen effective criteria for selecting a strategy by interviewing experts through extensive studies they chose an appropriate strategy for iran the results show that the best way for iran to enter the r m market is to have all major overhauls in the country ahmadi et al 2013 by reviewing risk based maintenance and repair method in this paper risk of drilling rig machinery and equipment is evaluated by a potential failure mode analysis based on their maintenance records then the most appropriate repair and maintenance policy for equipment in each class of risk were selected through hierarchical analysis based on cost feasibility safety and environmental criteria ahmadi et al 2013 francis guede 2019 in collaboration with bourav vertias developed an evaluation method for offshore rig risk management which identified rig operating system risks and identified quantitative and semi quantitative risks guede 2019 reasons for the importance of the need for repair and maintenance were presented by cha et al 2012 including high production costs transportation rig installation and high environmental pollution yu guang et al 2012 thus to provide services and make optimal use of existing facilities determining the right strategy for r m must ensure maximum utilization of minimum facilities to minimize opportunity costs multi objective decision making techniques are used to optimize and simulate this goal

costs and improved this proposed method which was developed using the cld cause loop simulation method the results showed that the proactive maintenance method was selected as the r m method hassan 2012 there are several criteria such as cost time environment safety when choosing an r m method table 1 provides a summary of some of the articles genetic algorithm is one of the methods surveyed in the field of solving optimization problems in various fields jalali et al 2020 jacyna golda and izdebski 2017 chou et al 2014 shafieefar and rezvani 2007 first developed by holland et al in the 1960s and 1970s and used for multi objective problems konak et al 2006 these problems include maintenance optimization decisions which is a way to increase economic profits and generate profits in all industries globally multi objective problems are used for optimization called multi criteria objective mco have two techniques which are multi attribute decision making madms and multi objective

different fields jalali et al 2020 taghizade et al 2019 niu et al 2018 yazdi et al 2019 motamed and majrouhi 2018 camara et al 2018 fu et al 2018 liao et al 2018 jacyna golda and izdebski 2017 apergis

2012 arunraj and maiti 2010 alborzi 2009 13 14 shafieefar and rezvani 2007 konak et al 2006 in addition to research surveyed the purpose of this study is to provide a method that can provide the most appropriate method of maintenance for masts because of numerous methods in this field only one method for offshore structures has been discussed and there is no complete summary for all methods the non dominated sort of genetic algorithm is used for optimization chen et al 2010 golabchi et al 2016 it also uses an elite strategy to avoid losing prominent people fu et al 2018 in addition nsga ii a multi objective genetic algorithm compatible with pareto front wu et al 2017 utilizes crowding distance calculation to eliminate the need for parameter specification syan and ramsoobag 2019 and can perform both real and binary representations kollat and reed 2006 the multi island genetic algorithm divides the population into several independent sub populations according to the concept of island it also solves the problem of premature convergence zeng and wang 2017 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 described how miga works wang et al 2017 in addition it can do elitism wang et al 2017 moea genetic algorithm uses basic principles of a genetic algorithm that include initial population crossover and mutation syan and ramsoobag 2019 according to syan and ramsoobag 2019 moea for maintenance cases further application based testing is needed syan and ramsoobag 2019 this method has been used in offshore separator vessel naval ship systems pressure safety injection system and coil fire boiler system busacca et al 2001 siddiqui et al 2017 gao et al 2015 nsga ii is a second generation moea developed by deb et al deb et al 2002 kollat and reed 2006 chen et al 2010 the nsga ii method has been used to optimize the ship s subdivision arrangement for offshore sequential ballast water exchange and the results were satisfactory chen et al 2010 also fu et al 2018 used this algorithm for optimization of the shape of an autonomous underwater glider based on the result the nsga ii has the best performance than other algorithms fu et al 2018 optimal solutions of miga and nsga ii algorithms are not significantly different both have a wide range of pareto answers meaning pareto answers are accurate and the trend of nsga ii in iteration process is best wang et al 2017 li and zhang 2009 in their paper presented results comparing nsga ii and moea algorithms which did not include solutions for neighboring sub problems in decision space moea d might not work very well and also moea algorithm is not always superior to nsga ii and other algorithms li and zhang 2009 nsga ii was popular for solving maintenance interval optimization type problems syan and ramsoobag 2019 considering the presented cases it can be stated that these three algorithms are at the same level in this paper we have chosen ones because of the purpose of the project as described below existing innovation is an optimization method used with the approach presented in this study based on the existing heuristic optimization framework to optimize jack ups for each maintenance method according to the purpose of paper which calls for reviewing several different criteria simultaneously nsga ii algorithm has been used non sorted genetic algorithm is used to execute the optimization chen et al 2010 nsga ii is also a multi objective genetic algorithm which is compatible with the pareto front wu et al 2017 the advantage of this study is to use the nsga ii algorithm method to select methods based on the relationship between the criteria the feature of jack ups and a variety of r m methods that instead of selecting maintenance methods an optimal jack up for each selection method is used by doing this any suitable method for the desired jack up is selected by comparing optimum jack up subscription of all articles reviewed is that choosing the r m method will reduce life cycle costs shutdown times and risks it is also a multi objective decision making problem the difference between articles reviewed is in the methods used and one method has been examined for example yazdi et al 2019 presented a risk based maintenance plan with the ahp technique for the rbm method yazdi et al 2019 ultimately the advantage of this study is to define criteria and features for the jack ups and select a suitable method based on these cases 3 research methodology in this research using nsga ii genetic algorithm coding optimal repair and maintenance method for jack up drilling rig is selected based on jack up features and criteria written in the matlab program as shown in fig 1 all stages of the research process are outlined including four stages from the beginning of the research data collection research method analysis and finally the conclusion the second step is the research process of coding consisting of six stages first step obtain features of jack up and value of each to determine research search scope and space second step review r m methods select the most important criteria for each method compare them with criteria for jack ups and finally select criteria for the objective function third step examine relevant and irrelevant features of each criterion and consider zero for irrelevant features fourth step define a formula that fits criteria and features this is one of the most important and sensitive parts of the research fifth step write the nsga ii genetic algorithm code sixth step write code for calculating euclidean distance of optimal jack up with sample jack ups given the subject of the project and method is chosen to do research the definition of the problem is important first to understand the project single objective and multi objective decision making issues were examined this project is an example of multi objective issues regarding multi objective issues the research problem was defined as follows gain an optimal jack up for each r m methods according to the criteria the following is a review of the data used the formulation and the implementation of code 3 1 data according to the purpose of the problem data required include the feature of jack ups types of r m methods and jack ups criteria jack up criteria include cost time quality convenience staff technology safety and the environment obtained through interviews with experts in the field of repair and maintenance oil industry in their paper syan and ramsoobag 2019 considered three steps to maintenance multi criteria objective problems the first step is criteria selection a complete list of criteria and their frequency are provided in a table where cost with 92 repetitions equals 61 3 in 23 criteria so the list was compared with criteria obtained through interviews with experts and the most important criteria were selected r m methods offered include corrective preventive proactive reliability based and risk based maintenance vishnu regikumar 2016 hassan 2012 which have different advantages disadvantages and features these methods were selected based on a comparison of syan and ramsoobag s article which presented a list of different r m strategies syan and ramsoobag 2019 for use in code jack up and r m methods criteria were compared and for use in code jack up and r m methods criteria were compared and finally criteria were selected for each method to be used as the objective function at least two criteria must be selected from criteria of cost time person hour and environmental safety criteria required for code of breakdown maintenance bm are cost and time for preventive maintenance pm is cost and person hour predictive maintenance pdm is cost time and person hour proactive maintenance is time person hour and environment health criteria and finally for reliability based maintenance rcm is cost time person hour and environment health the risk based method has not been used in this study due to the large risk category 3 2 jack ups feature in this project features were developed and selected based on existing jack ups research reviews information available on sites and credible sources thomas et al 2019 kim and kim 2017 nam et al 2017 motamed and majrouhi 2018 zhao et al 2014 wallin 2014 kaiser and snyder 2013 mashouri 2013 xian gang and yong 2013 tan et al 2003 table 2 presents the features with a brief explanation and references for the seventeen features defined attributes different numerical values are assigned which were considered to obtain the correct result of all numbers between zero and one and were calculated using formula1 formula1 converting attributed numbers to zero and one y x min max min 3 3 formulation after specifying data extensive studies were needed to determine the general formula for each criterion as the objective function and to relate features to the criteria which are not directly mentioned in references camara et al 2018 durazo cardenas et al 2018 jacyna golda and izdebski 2017 cha et al 2012 khalafallah and el rayes 2011 until specifying target functions table 3 shows formulas of the objective function these formulas are researchers conception as a researcher and another researcher may have a different view of these this list was reviewed from the standpoint of experts in the field of jack up repairs to ensure formulas and data relevance and changes were made the cost function values are used from repairs performed on sina1 as well as the cost of repairs performed in other countries motamed and majrouhi 2018 the reason for using sina1 data in research is that scope of research in iran and its cost is lower than the world level 32 the important point in this section is that the input of functions is the same for everyone otherwise they are not comparable according to table 3 the first feature is the distance from the sea which requires the information on tug for shipping the amount of fuel consumed and the price of diesel fuel to calculate its cost leg repairs feature was considered in two forms tripod and quadruple drilling rigs require overhaul every 3 10 years which has been calculated based on expert research and research study for the important feature of the rig two coefficients of 0 8 0 9 and 0 9 to 1 with the important factor suggested by experts are 1 2 and 1 5 respectively repair and maintenance is divided into repair in the shipyard and on site repair kaiser and synder 2013 in this study repair in the shipyard is considered also the amount of stopping in operation is for rotary system 45 well control system 11 drilling machine 10 flower circulation system 4 and other systems 30 fath halla 2014 finally the cost function of repairs equals formula3 cost objective function c cd cl co ci cs cc ce ch cdd cce cde cdr cb ct cr cdp cm the next function relates to the time of repair and maintenance of rigs with hour unit as for available information the time of repairing sina1 rigs was 120 days and for the four leg rig 150 days overhaul of the sina1 rig took about 14 months http www pgfkco com page id 2914 5 8 2018 12 34 p m to achieve the value of items such as the importance of rig for repair time and time of repairing systems which were provided with questions from experts and information of sina1 due to lack of information in this area the small intervals were considered different for the specificity of rig importance for the time of repair as well as for each system finally repair time function equals formula4 time objective function t td tl to ts tc te th tdd tce tde tdr tb tt tr tdp tm ti the next function relates to person hour people with different expertise in fields of manager supervisor installer welder blast worker painter and mechanic are required to repair legs there were 41 people in the complex at sina1 for four legs surveyed and questioned by experts about 51 people with 120 working days are considered there is no available information for overhaul but sina1 experts said 375000 people were working on the project coefficient of 1 05 was calculated for importance feature multiplied by the number of repairs per hour and its importance the coefficient of 1 05 was calculated for the important features of rigs that multiplied by the number of repairs person hour and its importance for some rig systems detailed information on their hourly rates is provided in table 3 however for most systems they have been able to offer some value in terms of repair experts finally the person hour function equals formula5 person hour objective function p phd phl pho phi phs phc phe phh phdd phce phdr phdr phb pht phr phdp phm the latest function is environment health research which includes issues such as fire water pollution air pollution and safety the coefficients of fire effects were 0 4 water pollution 0 4 air pollution 0 2 and safety 0 8 which were based on research and interviews with experts the appropriate factors were selected for each feature since the value of these coefficients is maximum finally a value between zero and these values was considered for each case accordingly the functions were defined for overhaul and shipyard feature because during repairing threaten people site and environment all of these factors were taken into account with the maximum coefficient engines include items with coefficients of safety 0 6 air pollution 0 1 water pollution 0 1 and fire 0 4 for drilling depth safety 0 4 and water pollution 0 3 the cementing system has 0 4 water pollution derrick includes safety 0 8 and water pollution 0 3 drawworks safety

pollution 0 4 05 finally the environment health function equals formula6 environment health objective function e ehd ehl eho ehi ehs ehc ehe ehh ehdd ehce ehde ehdr ehb eht her ehdp ehm 3 4 code implementation objective functions were first written and tested in separate files in matlab therefore if there was an error at the beginning of the program the problem was fixed so as not to cause errors in the original code nsga ii file was downloaded from the matlab site developed by researchers at kanpur genetic algorithm laboratory and changes were made to the process of doing work appropriate to the project the project code is executed as follows get gen and pop check error of gen and pop get the number of the objective function get the number of decision variables enter the min and max range of decision variables enter c to continue the code show the results in ascii text the nsga ii file contains a multi objective optimization function and it contains input parameters of population size and the number of generations first the population size and stop criterion or the total number of generations are entered so that algorithm stops automatically errors are revisited after entering the number of objective functions number and range of decision variables initialization is done at random after non dominated sorting of initial population is carried out and finally the evolution process begins where appropriate parents for reproduction were selected and crossover and mutation operators are executed in the parent selection of parents and offspring are performed and inappropriate individuals are replaced with appropriate individuals to maintain population size the last front includes people with low crowding distance finally the results are saved in an ascii text file also results are displayed on the 2d and 3d charts outputs of work data are divided into two categories some are returned to their original values and others are used as zero and one as presented in table 4 finally in the last section they are used to calculate euclidean distance a file was written to return the original value with the name of mapping function function nsga 2 error checking objective function initialize the population sort the initialized population non dominated sort start the evolution process o choosing parents for o run genetic operator in parents o choosing parents offspring o replace not suitable chromosome with suitable chromosome saving the results in txt file and visualize in 2d 3d graphs the euclidean distance between the sample and optimal jack ups of each r m method was calculated to find an appropriate method for jack up written in a separate file first the number of jack ups is asked from the user and a window for entering jack ups features returns where the window corresponding is opened the number of jack ups user at this point the user must read the features guide before entering their jack ups information in order to enter information correctly 4 data analysis the genetic algorithm was implemented in the matlab program the number of generations was 100 and the number of the population varied from 1000 to 15000 the results are also presented graphically in figures in the following tables selecting the best answer in the pareto chart is the min max method this method seeks to minimize the maximum distance therefore the answering process ends the best points were minimized for two three and four functions with the objective functions being cost time person hour and environment health for each r m method a graph was obtained based on its functions according to code the final answer was chosen for each method the last population answer being the optimal one for all codes the number of decision variables is 17 the maximum range of features changes is 1 and the minimum is zero except for the fifth attribute the maximum and the minimum is 1 the features are presented in table 2 at first corrective maintenance method code and then preventive maintenance method code was implemented with the following settings the result of both methods are presented in fig 2 optimal diagram and jack up information for the settings the results of the implementation are shown in fig 2 including figures and final optimal solutions in each figure each point represents a jack up as mentioned in code information the last population answers are optimal ones presented in two columns in fig 2 each column represents a jack up and each row represents different features of jack ups in fig 2a by comparing figures a21 and a22 it is interpreted that as increases number of iterations and population size the accuracy of pareto front increases and proximity of solutions shown in figures is the degree of crowding distance which is the criteria of uniformity of the pareto solutions costs and time are calculated for each answer population member answer points are well converged in fig a22 and pareto front is well distributed fig a22 has better conditions as a result the desired answer is chosen from fig a22 the points closest to the pareto line are the best answer for example 5 which is repairing in the shipyard feature is set to 0 for all conditions and other features are variable these numbers are obtained by executing code given results in the second column values of 3 13 and 14 are approximately equal to their values in the third column second column numbers are more accurate because of the larger population size for example 16 for the second column is 0 5 and the third column is 1 the values of x and y are almost the same for both columns where the x axis represents time and the y axis represents the cost the time value of the third column selected as optimal jack up for this method is 5 10998e 04 and its cost is 3 0809e 08 these numbers are optimal values for suitable jack up for correction method in fig 2b by comparing figures it is interpreted that with an increasing number of iterations and population size and number of generations pareto front accuracy has increased according to figures in the first run the answers are on the pareto line long enough and the pareto line is not complete but as the population grew the line became more complete and the answers closer together finally the answers are more accurate in fig b22 the answer points have good convergence and pareto front is well distributed optimal points were minimized for both functions according to results in the third column the value of 2 is equal to zero and it indicates jack up has three legs second column numbers are more accurate because the larger the population size so it s more accurate for example the value of 16 is 0 52 for the second column and 0 97 for the fourth column this value represents the height of the optimum jack up s drill pipe which is 21 300 feet however the values of x and y are also approximately the same for all three columns where the x axis represents cost and the y axis represents person hour the cost of the fourth column chosen as optimal jack up for this method is 3 1373370e 07 and its person hour value is 7 8029988e 07 these numbers are optimal values for a suitable jack up for the preventive method predictive maintenance method code and proactive maintenance method code were implemented with the following settings the result of both methods are presented in fig 3 optimal diagram and jack up information for the settings the results of the implementation are shown in fig 3 including figures and final optimal solutions in each figure each point represents a jack up as mentioned in code information the last population answers are optimal ones presented in two columns in fig 3 with each column representing a jack up and each row representing different features of the jack ups by comparing the result shown it can be interpreted that accuracy of the pareto front increases with an increasing number of iterations and population size relative to each other the lower distance of this answer makes up a complete line without spaces which results are optimal in fig 3a each figure consists of three parts because of having three objective functions so the graph is obtained in 3d the answers were presented separately to illustrate the relationship in row a is the person hours and time figures in row b is cost and person hours figures and in row c is cost and time figures according to figures answer points have good convergence and pareto front is well distributed in fig a33 other figures on their pareto front have gaps and less data convergence optimal points were minimized for all three functions the data in fig a33 are closer to others and represent a more complete line this is also a case in other rows the point is that since the population of fig a33 is extremely large with fig a31 and fig a32 the difference is visible in figures according to results in column 4 15000 100 the value of 1 is 0 5 so putting this in the formula in table 3 equates to the distance of 271 km from the site the fourth column numbers are more accurate because of the larger population size so it s more accurate for example the value of 17 for the second column is 0 941 and the fourth column is 0 927 this represents the optimal 3 nov 14p 220 2200 hp mud pump the values of x y and z are also nearly the same for all three columns with the x axis indicating person hour the y axis indicating time and the z axis indicating cost cost for the fourth column chosen as optimal jack up for this method is 3 0964762e 07 time value is 8 2120839e 07 and person hour value is 3 6801378e 04 there are optimal values for the jack up which is suitable for predictive methods in fig 3b settings of 1000 2000 were first considered for the proactive maintenance method because the responses were not convergent setting increased and the above results were obtained in part b each figure consists of three parts because of three objective functions and figures are obtained in three dimensional form the answers were presented separately to illustrate the relationship optimal points were minimized for all three functions according to two dimensional figures with the increase of the z axis settings it gets closer to the pareto line in row a is environment health and time figures in row b is environment health and person hour figures and in row c is time and person hour figures according to figures the data in fig b33a are less scattered as shown and they tend to build a more complete line than any other row figures the same thing can be seen in other rows rows b and c in fig b33 have more complete line data than other figures according to results obtained in the section on optimum jack up specifications for the activist method the fourth column numbers are more accurate because of larger the population size and greater accuracy for example in the fourth column 10000 100 of 7 equals 0 99 and according to table 3 the engine of this jack up is 2514 kw the value of 14 for the second column 8000 100 is 0 987 and the fourth column is 0 999 this value represents nov tds 85a top drive the optimal jack up due to table 3 the x axis represents person hour the y axis represents time and the z axis represents the cost the cost for the fourth column chosen as optimal jack up for this method is 8 9734715e 02 the time value is 7 7912815e 07 and the person hour value is 6 4412960e 04 these numbers are optimal values for suitable jack up for this method the code settings of the reliability based method are as follows where two settings are used in this method and each one repeated three times run1 pop 2000 gen 100 run2 pop 3000 gen 100 each point obtained is a jack up given that the reliability based method has four objective functions and code displays up to three objective functions on the figure the settings were repeated several times to make sure the answer was correct the last population answer is the best and optimal one presented in table 5 the results show settings did not change despite repeating settings which indicates the code s repeatability according to results in tables 5 and 3 the seventh column is 7 equal to 9 3436467e 01 the role and importance of this jack up is 0 9 cost of last column as the optimal jack up for this method is 3 1658318e 07 time value is 4 2764825e 04 its effective person hour is 8 1330757e 07 and environment health value is 5 4867412e 02 4 1 validation in this article a multi objective optimization method called pareto optimization is used to evaluate the results in the pareto front points closer to the axis of the diagram indicate more optimal solutions the solutions obtained on pareto front are divided into dominated and non dominated solutions taghizade et al 2019 after reaching a solution on the pareto front one of them needs to be selected for implementation huang 2015 the properties and functions of random variables such as mean and variance are usually accepted and are used to determine the validity of the model sargent 2013 in fig 4 the selected range of solutions was identified with red the answers were selected according to the median line and the objective functions table 7 compares the values of the solutions the value of min max median solution1 solution2 optimum solution and dominated solution are provided in table 7 the values of features of the solution are shown in table 8 and their graphs are in fig 5 the values of the features of these solutions were expected to be similar and very slight the dominated solution was selected based on the objective function for each method for example predictive maintenance method the person hour function is minimum in optimum solution the value of the person hour function is maximum for the dominated solution as shown in diagrams and according to the values of features in table 8 the answers of all methods are on the same level and there is a small difference thus some of the features and objective functions were examined for all methods in the corrective maintenance method the value of 8 helideck despite the very small difference all of them are in the same range and belong to a specific type of helideck also 7 and 11 are in the same range which are related to the features of engines and derrick comparing the optimum solution with the dominated solution many differences can be seen for example 10 is related to the cementing system according to tabl e3 the cementing system for the dominated solution is halliburton and the optimum solution is halliburton skd 4 this condition is for 4 12 and 17 which indicate the difference between optimum jack up and dominated solution the median value of cost function is 3 12e 08 and the value of cost function of solutions 1 2 are 3 10e 08 3 11e 08 the value of optimum solution cost functions is 3 08e 08 due to the proximity of values the value of optimum solution cost function for code is acceptable also the median value of time function is 4 53e 04 and the value of time function of solutions 1 2 are 4 52e 04 4 39e 04 the value of optimum solution time functions is 5 10e 04 however the value of the time function of the selected optimum solution is very different from other values the advantage of optimum solution over other solutions is less cost and less crowding distance which is one of the selected parameters of optimum solutions on the pareto front in the preventive maintenance method the value of solution features 1 and 2 does not differ from the optimum solution nevertheless the value of 10 for solution 1 is halliburton and solution 2 and optimum is 3rd party supplied because the values of solution 2 and the optimum solution are close to each other the final solution can be investigated by examining the objective functions and crowding distance by comparing the dominated and optimum solution many of features such as 3 6 9 11 and 13 are different for example 3 provides overhaul repairs every 10 years and it is for the optimum solution is every 3 years because of increasing the amount of work with equipment and not repairing them in time it will cause more damages apergis et al 2017 the median value of cost function is 7 977e 07 and the value of cost function of solutions 1 2 are 7 808e 07 7 815e 07 the value of optimum solution cost functions is 7 802e 07 due to the proximity of values the value of optimum solution cost function for code is acceptable also the median value of person hour function is 3 046e 07 and the value of time function of solutions 1 2 are 3 132e 07 3 124e 07 the value of optimum solution person hour functions is 3 137e 07 and crowding distance is 8 70292e 03 given that the closeness of values and the slight difference between them the value of cost function and person hour optimum solution selected in the code is acceptable the maximum and minimum functions depend on the type of r m method specified in code in the predictive maintenance method the features of solution 1 2 and the optimum solution are very slight for example for 1 which is related to distance from rig to the land the difference between the value of this feature in solution 1 2 and the optimum solution is very small and are in the same range the 10 is related to the cementing system are same for solutions 1 2 and optimum solution and by comparing the dominated solution the two types are different also for feature 16 the top drive of the optimum solution is varco tds 85a and the dominated solution is nov tds 85a the median value of time function is 7 99e 04 and the value of time function of solutions 1 2 are 3 97e 04 4 65e 04 the value of optimum solution time functions is 3 68e 04 the median value of person hour function is 8 225e 07 and the value of person hour function of solutions 1 2 are 8 168e 07 8 215e 07 the value of optimum solution person hour functions is 8 212e 07 also the median value of cost function is 3 127e 07 and the value of cost function of solutions 1 2 are 3 103e 07 3 095e 07 the value of optimum solution cost functions is 3 096e 07 and crowding distance is 1 99014e 04 in this method cost and time function become maximized and person hour becomes minimized given that the values are close to each other and their differences are very small the value of cost and time are less than the average value because by being less than the average the solution can be achieved the less value of person hour in the proactive maintenance method as in previous methods solutions 1 2 and optimum solution are very small differences there is more difference between the optimum solution and the dominated solution for example 9 which is related to drill depth has a depth of 20 000 ft for the dominated solution and 400 000 ft for the optimum solution also top driver 14 dominated solution is varco tds 85a and the optimal solution is nov tds 85a the median value of time function is 4 965e 04 and the value of time function of solutions 1 2 are 5 995e 04 6 559e 04 the value of optimum solution time functions is 6 441e 04 the median value of person hour function is 8 135e 07 and the value of person hour function of solutions 1 2 are 7 52e 07 7 775e 07 the value of optimum solution person hour functions is 8 973e 07 also the median value of environment health the function is 646 85 and the value of the environment health function of solutions 1 2 are 820 26 853 17 the value of optimum solution environment health functions is 897 34 and crowding distance is 3 17393e 04 the value of environment health and time function are more and the value of the person hour function is less than the average value also the crowding distance of the optimum solution is less in the reliability based maintenance method the difference between the features of solutions 1 2 and the optimum solution is slight and all of them are in the same range however these differences with the x values of the dominated solution are more for example according to 10 the top drive of solutions 1 2 and optimum ones are nov tds 85a and the dominated solution is varco tds 4h the value of time function of solutions 1 2 are 4 423e 04 5 765e 04 and optimum solution is 4 276 04 the value of person hour function of solutions 1 2 are 8 171e 07 7 907e 07 and optimum solution is 8 133e 07 also the value of cost functions solutions 1 2 are 3 046e 07 3 236e 07 and their environment health functions are 5 428e 02 4 971e 02 respectively the value of cost and environment health function of optimum solution is equal to 3 165e 07 and 5 486e 02 the optimum solution has more value time function with less value of person hour function compare to others which has increased the value of the environment health function and even has a lower crowding distance as mentioned there was a small difference between pareto s solution depending on chosen methods the max and min values of functions as well as crowding distance as an important parameter for pareto solution also all features of the solutions 1 2 and optimum solution were examined and there was no difference despite the slight differences in features of the solutions 1 2 and optimal solution they are in the same range these differences do not change the equipment and systems of jack ups as a result the logical process between the answers is confirmed based on the results the desired solutions for this project were selected the dominated solution is not the same as optimum jack ups that are determined by comparing them some features were variable in the methods which had a large effect on solutions indicating the importance of these features by examining these results choosing a jack up for each method is the logical process the aim of this optimization that enables experts and engineers to compare different options of the r m method for repairing 5 results according to the subject of the article and research method the existing r m methods were evaluated some figures were provided for each method implemented optimal solutions for each method were selected from figures a22 b22 a33 b33 and even table 5 finally an optimal solution was provided for each repair and maintenance method therefore depending on the r m method and jack up it can save time and cost as well as increase safety and better environmental protection table 6 presents optimal jack up information for each method to be used for the next step as previously stated the results from figs 2 and 3 and table 5 show optimal jack up for each r m method these answers may differ based on the amount of change in performance but a repetition of these performances does not significantly alter responses according to the purpose of the paper is choosing a proper r m method for the jack ups the issue is there are many jack ups in the world and iran they do not have the same feature features of jack ups were presented on authentic sites such as infield com etc that means a jack up may have three legs and the other one has four legs or have different engines so their repair conditions are different as a result an optimized jack up with optimization of functions cost person hour time and environmental health was chosen to continue the process for each method subsequently in another code some of the features presented in table 3 were returned to their original values and the rest were used in the same values on the other hand a code for calculating euclidean distance was developed to continue research that the features of optimized jack ups of each method wrote so users could present their jack up features to compare with optimum jack up features of each method and calculate euclidean distance the point is that the jack ups feature is used to calculate euclidean distance and objective functions are used to find optimal jack ups for each r m method as a result due to the purpose that was initially presented at the end of the research a model was developed to select the optimal method of jack ups r m as described above an optimum jack up was selected for each method then the user enters jack up information and finally the optimal method for that jack up is determined the user by examining results will find the most optimal method for rigs the most appropriate r m method for the desired jack up is one that has less distance with optimal jack up as a result the most optimal strategy for repairs is selected at the right time and cost of r m operation a method for a jack up is under repair has selected and reviewed in previous research in this study all methods except risk based were considered therefore experts can make the right decision also important safety and environmental issue which is of paramount importance today were considered to investigate the potential hazards and to minimize them minimizing casualties financial and environmental losses 6 conclusion in this paper a multi objective problem is proposed to select suitable repair and maintenance method for jack ups according to jack ups features and criteria of r m methods based on nsga ii genetic algorithm optimal results generated by the algorithm depend on many parameters such as mutation initial population size and stopping criterion in the implementation of the algorithm different combinations of population size and the total number of generations were considered so that the rate of mutation and repetition were the same a significant achievement of this research is to obtain optimal jack ups for each r m method which were obtained according to different objective functions optimal results can be obtained by testing initial parameters with a larger population and a longer time however if there is a time limit with a modest initial population acceptable answers are also obtained in this study an efficient and appropriate model for solving multi objective decision making problems for optimal repair and maintenance method selection is provided by specifying a variety of available methods criteria and seventeen features for jack up that this model can obtain an optimal r m method for each jack up based on optimal jack ups of each method and euclidean distance calculation despite some inconsistencies in some objective functions simultaneous optimization is performed in other words the proposed algorithm is a kind of decision support system for selecting jack ups r m method allowing managers to obtain results by specifying the priorities and considering the optimal r m method for jack ups and make the best decision according to the cost of repair and maintenance and the time of delivery 7 future work in reviewed articles using multi objective optimization methods for maintenance and repair has been accepted it has not yet been thoroughly investigated in the context of repair and maintenance of the rigs more research is needed in this part the concluding remarks showed that in addition to this other genetic algorithms could be developed and compared with nsga ii results also checking the result of these model need experiments and repaired jack up information as an example that should provide researchers credit authorship contribution statement mojgan mortezaei farizhendy writing original draft software writing review editing

21711,iran is the world s fourth largest oil producer and 25 of iranian drilling rigs are of a jack ups type most of which require repair choosing the right repair and maintenance method for the iranian oil industry is critical the existence of different r m methods and the need to taking cost time of maintenance human resources and environment health criteria into account make this problem a multi objective optimization problem which depends on the quantitative and qualitative criteria the main purpose of the paper is to develop a tool that can introduce an efficient solution to the multi objective problem of selecting a jack up and r m method based on an efficient technique in this study the nsga ii genetic algorithm was used as an optimization tool to determine the proper r m method according to characteristics of the jack ups and effective criteria the results were computed for a sample jack up based on determining euclidean distance between the optimum and sample jack ups for each method the results show which method best for the jack ups the results of this research help the experts of the jack up r m make the right decision according to the available assets cost and time of the jack up keywords genetic algorithm nsga ii jack up drilling rigs maintenance and repair method decision making 1 introduction jack ups have a prominent role in oil and gas developments as low to medium depth offshore drilling rigs pisano et al 2019 kaiser and snyder 2013 which need overhaul repairs every 3 10 years with these repairs being different from each other perrons and richards 2013 selecting an r m method is required for maintaining and repairing jack ups there are various methods such as corrective maintenance preventive maintenance predictive maintenance reliability based maintenance and proactive maintenance vishnu regikumar 2016 hassan 2012 which are used to maintain and repair rigs incorrect selection of the r m method for jack up causes significant financial environmental damage and casualties several factors influence the selection of the optimal method different tools are also required to choose the method of maintenance that are capable of comparing multiple objectives one of these tools is the genetic algorithm with nsga ii algorithms being one of them especially used for multi objective problems konak et al 2006 jalali et al 2020 the oil and gas services industry is predicted to reach 350 billion by 2020 which is predominantly related to drilling rig maintenance motamed and majruhi 2018 and as mentioned systems need to be upgraded and repaired perrons and richards 2013 problem definitions are important factors in getting started and doing research noorzai and golabchi 2020 noorzai 2020 abbasi et al 2020 gharouni jafari et al 2020 the fact that what data is needed to do research what r m methods and their criteria are what features and criteria of jack ups repair and maintenance are and what methods can be used for repair and maintenance are questions of this research the main purpose of the research is to develop a tool for improving solving the multi objective problem of selecting the r m method for jack ups to achieve optimum jack up for each method to use a suitable method for repairing required rigs thus it saves time and money and even safety and environmental items are more in the maintenance of jack ups scope of study choosing the r m method in this research is active jack ups in the persian gulf information required for the research was obtained through access to various jack up data sina1 isoico shipyard information as well as much information required through interviews with experts in this field in the following topics such as the literature review of r m methods jack ups and nsga ii genetic algorithm is examined then a research methodology that its stages data analysis conclusion and results are presented 2 literature review jack ups like other equipment suffer from overuse of massive machinery and equipment which can cause damage apergis et al 2017 various solutions have been provided to pick out maintenance methods that many researchers in various industries have worked on appropriate methods and tools in their paper ghasemi and khodaverdi 2017 have discussed definitions of the meaning of repair and maintenance and the necessity of examining the field of marine systems usa s industries spend 200 billion dollars annually on their equipment maintenance which saves 60 billion dollars annually with proper management ghasemi and khodaverdi 2017 to achieve high reliability and superior safety performance there is a need for a proper r m plan in recent decades various strategies have been put forward to providing an appropriate r m plan such as reliable repair and maintenance and monitoring of conditions in the oil and gas industry pui et al 2017 bhandari et al 2016 abbassi et al 2016 as a result choosing a repair and maintenance policy is a multi criteria decision arunraj and maiti 2010 there are different ways to research this area according to studies most researchers have solved their problems using the fuzzy hierarchy method yazdi et al 2019 presented a risk based maintenance plan with the ahp technique and rbm method yazdi et al 2019 in their research motamed and majrouhi 2018 identified fifteen effective criteria for selecting a strategy by interviewing experts through extensive studies they chose an appropriate strategy for iran the results show that the best way for iran to enter the r m market is to have all major overhauls in the country ahmadi et al 2013 by reviewing risk based maintenance and repair method in this paper risk of drilling rig machinery and equipment is evaluated by a potential failure mode analysis based on their maintenance records then the most appropriate repair and maintenance policy for equipment in each class of risk were selected through hierarchical analysis based on cost feasibility safety and environmental criteria ahmadi et al 2013 francis guede 2019 in collaboration with bourav vertias developed an evaluation method for offshore rig risk management which identified rig operating system risks and identified quantitative and semi quantitative risks guede 2019 reasons for the importance of the need for repair and maintenance were presented by cha et al 2012 including high production costs transportation rig installation and high environmental pollution yu guang et al 2012 thus to provide services and make optimal use of existing facilities determining the right strategy for r m must ensure maximum utilization of minimum facilities to minimize opportunity costs multi objective decision making techniques are used to optimize and simulate this goal which include several methods bassi et al 2012 studied neural networks bassi et al 2012 hassan presented an electrical maintenance system for drilling rig due to reduced shutdown time reduced net costs and improved this proposed method which was developed using the cld cause loop simulation method the results showed that the proactive maintenance method was selected as the r m method hassan 2012 there are several criteria such as cost time environment safety when choosing an r m method table 1 provides a summary of some of the articles genetic algorithm is one of the methods surveyed in the field of solving optimization problems in various fields jalali et al 2020 jacyna golda and izdebski 2017 chou et al 2014 shafieefar and rezvani 2007 first developed by holland et al in the 1960s and 1970s and used for multi objective problems konak et al 2006 these problems include maintenance optimization decisions which is a way to increase economic profits and generate profits in all industries globally multi objective problems are used for optimization called multi criteria objective mco have two techniques which are multi attribute decision making madms and multi objective decision making modms and each has different methods the genetic algorithm has many different types such as nsga ii spea ii and moea syan and ramsoobag 2019 a wide range of studies has been performed in the field of drilling repair and maintenance and a variety of methods most of them have focused on how to choose the r m method using ahp fuzzy analysis neural networks and genetic algorithms in different fields jalali et al 2020 taghizade et al 2019 niu et al 2018 yazdi et al 2019 motamed and majrouhi 2018 camara et al 2018 fu et al 2018 liao et al 2018 jacyna golda and izdebski 2017 apergis et al 2017 gourlis et al 2016 pui et al 2017 wu et al 2017 bhandari et al 2016 abbassi et al 2016 chou et al 2014 xian gang et al 2013 ahmadi et al 2013 bassi et al 2012 yu guang et al 2012 hassan 2012 arunraj and maiti 2010 alborzi 2009 13 14 shafieefar and rezvani 2007 konak et al 2006 in addition to research surveyed the purpose of this study is to provide a method that can provide the most appropriate method of maintenance for masts because of numerous methods in this field only one method for offshore structures has been discussed and there is no complete summary for all methods the non dominated sort of genetic algorithm is used for optimization chen et al 2010 golabchi et al 2016 it also uses an elite strategy to avoid losing prominent people fu et al 2018 in addition nsga ii a multi objective genetic algorithm compatible with pareto front wu et al 2017 utilizes crowding distance calculation to eliminate the need for parameter specification syan and ramsoobag 2019 and can perform both real and binary representations kollat and reed 2006 the multi island genetic algorithm divides the population into several independent sub populations according to the concept of island it also solves the problem of premature convergence zeng and wang 2017 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 described how miga works wang et al 2017 in addition it can do elitism wang et al 2017 moea genetic algorithm uses basic principles of a genetic algorithm that include initial population crossover and mutation syan and ramsoobag 2019 according to syan and ramsoobag 2019 moea for maintenance cases further application based testing is needed syan and ramsoobag 2019 this method has been used in offshore separator vessel naval ship systems pressure safety injection system and coil fire boiler system busacca et al 2001 siddiqui et al 2017 gao et al 2015 nsga ii is a second generation moea developed by deb et al deb et al 2002 kollat and reed 2006 chen et al 2010 the nsga ii method has been used to optimize the ship s subdivision arrangement for offshore sequential ballast water exchange and the results were satisfactory chen et al 2010 also fu et al 2018 used this algorithm for optimization of the shape of an autonomous underwater glider based on the result the nsga ii has the best performance than other algorithms fu et al 2018 optimal solutions of miga and nsga ii algorithms are not significantly different both have a wide range of pareto answers meaning pareto answers are accurate and the trend of nsga ii in iteration process is best wang et al 2017 li and zhang 2009 in their paper presented results comparing nsga ii and moea algorithms which did not include solutions for neighboring sub problems in decision space moea d might not work very well and also moea algorithm is not always superior to nsga ii and other algorithms li and zhang 2009 nsga ii was popular for solving maintenance interval optimization type problems syan and ramsoobag 2019 considering the presented cases it can be stated that these three algorithms are at the same level in this paper we have chosen ones because of the purpose of the project as described below existing innovation is an optimization method used with the approach presented in this study based on the existing heuristic optimization framework to optimize jack ups for each maintenance method according to the purpose of paper which calls for reviewing several different criteria simultaneously nsga ii algorithm has been used non sorted genetic algorithm is used to execute the optimization chen et al 2010 nsga ii is also a multi objective genetic algorithm which is compatible with the pareto front wu et al 2017 the advantage of this study is to use the nsga ii algorithm method to select methods based on the relationship between the criteria the feature of jack ups and a variety of r m methods that instead of selecting maintenance methods an optimal jack up for each selection method is used by doing this any suitable method for the desired jack up is selected by comparing optimum jack up subscription of all articles reviewed is that choosing the r m method will reduce life cycle costs shutdown times and risks it is also a multi objective decision making problem the difference between articles reviewed is in the methods used and one method has been examined for example yazdi et al 2019 presented a risk based maintenance plan with the ahp technique for the rbm method yazdi et al 2019 ultimately the advantage of this study is to define criteria and features for the jack ups and select a suitable method based on these cases 3 research methodology in this research using nsga ii genetic algorithm coding optimal repair and maintenance method for jack up drilling rig is selected based on jack up features and criteria written in the matlab program as shown in fig 1 all stages of the research process are outlined including four stages from the beginning of the research data collection research method analysis and finally the conclusion the second step is the research process of coding consisting of six stages first step obtain features of jack up and value of each to determine research search scope and space second step review r m methods select the most important criteria for each method compare them with criteria for jack ups and finally select criteria for the objective function third step examine relevant and irrelevant features of each criterion and consider zero for irrelevant features fourth step define a formula that fits criteria and features this is one of the most important and sensitive parts of the research fifth step write the nsga ii genetic algorithm code sixth step write code for calculating euclidean distance of optimal jack up with sample jack ups given the subject of the project and method is chosen to do research the definition of the problem is important first to understand the project single objective and multi objective decision making issues were examined this project is an example of multi objective issues regarding multi objective issues the research problem was defined as follows gain an optimal jack up for each r m methods according to the criteria the following is a review of the data used the formulation and the implementation of code 3 1 data according to the purpose of the problem data required include the feature of jack ups types of r m methods and jack ups criteria jack up criteria include cost time quality convenience staff technology safety and the environment obtained through interviews with experts in the field of repair and maintenance oil industry in their paper syan and ramsoobag 2019 considered three steps to maintenance multi criteria objective problems the first step is criteria selection a complete list of criteria and their frequency are provided in a table where cost with 92 repetitions equals 61 3 in 23 criteria so the list was compared with criteria obtained through interviews with experts and the most important criteria were selected r m methods offered include corrective preventive proactive reliability based and risk based maintenance vishnu regikumar 2016 hassan 2012 which have different advantages disadvantages and features these methods were selected based on a comparison of syan and ramsoobag s article which presented a list of different r m strategies syan and ramsoobag 2019 for use in code jack up and r m methods criteria were compared and for use in code jack up and r m methods criteria were compared and finally criteria were selected for each method to be used as the objective function at least two criteria must be selected from criteria of cost time person hour and environmental safety criteria required for code of breakdown maintenance bm are cost and time for preventive maintenance pm is cost and person hour predictive maintenance pdm is cost time and person hour proactive maintenance is time person hour and environment health criteria and finally for reliability based maintenance rcm is cost time person hour and environment health the risk based method has not been used in this study due to the large risk category 3 2 jack ups feature in this project features were developed and selected based on existing jack ups research reviews information available on sites and credible sources thomas et al 2019 kim and kim 2017 nam et al 2017 motamed and majrouhi 2018 zhao et al 2014 wallin 2014 kaiser and snyder 2013 mashouri 2013 xian gang and yong 2013 tan et al 2003 table 2 presents the features with a brief explanation and references for the seventeen features defined attributes different numerical values are assigned which were considered to obtain the correct result of all numbers between zero and one and were calculated using formula1 formula1 converting attributed numbers to zero and one y x min max min 3 3 formulation after specifying data extensive studies were needed to determine the general formula for each criterion as the objective function and to relate features to the criteria which are not directly mentioned in references camara et al 2018 durazo cardenas et al 2018 jacyna golda and izdebski 2017 cha et al 2012 khalafallah and el rayes 2011 until specifying target functions table 3 shows formulas of the objective function these formulas are researchers conception as a researcher and another researcher may have a different view of these this list was reviewed from the standpoint of experts in the field of jack up repairs to ensure formulas and data relevance and changes were made the cost function values are used from repairs performed on sina1 as well as the cost of repairs performed in other countries motamed and majrouhi 2018 the reason for using sina1 data in research is that scope of research in iran and its cost is lower than the world level 32 the important point in this section is that the input of functions is the same for everyone otherwise they are not comparable according to table 3 the first feature is the distance from the sea which requires the information on tug for shipping the amount of fuel consumed and the price of diesel fuel to calculate its cost leg repairs feature was considered in two forms tripod and quadruple drilling rigs require overhaul every 3 10 years which has been calculated based on expert research and research study for the important feature of the rig two coefficients of 0 8 0 9 and 0 9 to 1 with the important factor suggested by experts are 1 2 and 1 5 respectively repair and maintenance is divided into repair in the shipyard and on site repair kaiser and synder 2013 in this study repair in the shipyard is considered also the amount of stopping in operation is for rotary system 45 well control system 11 drilling machine 10 flower circulation system 4 and other systems 30 fath halla 2014 finally the cost function of repairs equals formula3 cost objective function c cd cl co ci cs cc ce ch cdd cce cde cdr cb ct cr cdp cm the next function relates to the time of repair and maintenance of rigs with hour unit as for available information the time of repairing sina1 rigs was 120 days and for the four leg rig 150 days overhaul of the sina1 rig took about 14 months http www pgfkco com page id 2914 5 8 2018 12 34 p m to achieve the value of items such as the importance of rig for repair time and time of repairing systems which were provided with questions from experts and information of sina1 due to lack of information in this area the small intervals were considered different for the specificity of rig importance for the time of repair as well as for each system finally repair time function equals formula4 time objective function t td tl to ts tc te th tdd tce tde tdr tb tt tr tdp tm ti the next function relates to person hour people with different expertise in fields of manager supervisor installer welder blast worker painter and mechanic are required to repair legs there were 41 people in the complex at sina1 for four legs surveyed and questioned by experts about 51 people with 120 working days are considered there is no available information for overhaul but sina1 experts said 375000 people were working on the project coefficient of 1 05 was calculated for importance feature multiplied by the number of repairs per hour and its importance the coefficient of 1 05 was calculated for the important features of rigs that multiplied by the number of repairs person hour and its importance for some rig systems detailed information on their hourly rates is provided in table 3 however for most systems they have been able to offer some value in terms of repair experts finally the person hour function equals formula5 person hour objective function p phd phl pho phi phs phc phe phh phdd phce phdr phdr phb pht phr phdp phm the latest function is environment health research which includes issues such as fire water pollution air pollution and safety the coefficients of fire effects were 0 4 water pollution 0 4 air pollution 0 2 and safety 0 8 which were based on research and interviews with experts the appropriate factors were selected for each feature since the value of these coefficients is maximum finally a value between zero and these values was considered for each case accordingly the functions were defined for overhaul and shipyard feature because during repairing threaten people site and environment all of these factors were taken into account with the maximum coefficient engines include items with coefficients of safety 0 6 air pollution 0 1 water pollution 0 1 and fire 0 4 for drilling depth safety 0 4 and water pollution 0 3 the cementing system has 0 4 water pollution derrick includes safety 0 8 and water pollution 0 3 drawworks safety 0 6 and water pollution 0 25 blow out preventers safety 0 1 and fire 0 4 top drive safety 0 5 rotary table safety 0 4 drill pipe safety 0 45 and fire 0 3 and mud pumps included safety 0 3 and water pollution 0 4 05 finally the environment health function equals formula6 environment health objective function e ehd ehl eho ehi ehs ehc ehe ehh ehdd ehce ehde ehdr ehb eht her ehdp ehm 3 4 code implementation objective functions were first written and tested in separate files in matlab therefore if there was an error at the beginning of the program the problem was fixed so as not to cause errors in the original code nsga ii file was downloaded from the matlab site developed by researchers at kanpur genetic algorithm laboratory and changes were made to the process of doing work appropriate to the project the project code is executed as follows get gen and pop check error of gen and pop get the number of the objective function get the number of decision variables enter the min and max range of decision variables enter c to continue the code show the results in ascii text the nsga ii file contains a multi objective optimization function and it contains input parameters of population size and the number of generations first the population size and stop criterion or the total number of generations are entered so that algorithm stops automatically errors are revisited after entering the number of objective functions number and range of decision variables initialization is done at random after non dominated sorting of initial population is carried out and finally the evolution process begins where appropriate parents for reproduction were selected and crossover and mutation operators are executed in the parent selection of parents and offspring are performed and inappropriate individuals are replaced with appropriate individuals to maintain population size the last front includes people with low crowding distance finally the results are saved in an ascii text file also results are displayed on the 2d and 3d charts outputs of work data are divided into two categories some are returned to their original values and others are used as zero and one as presented in table 4 finally in the last section they are used to calculate euclidean distance a file was written to return the original value with the name of mapping function function nsga 2 error checking objective function initialize the population sort the initialized population non dominated sort start the evolution process o choosing parents for o run genetic operator in parents o choosing parents offspring o replace not suitable chromosome with suitable chromosome saving the results in txt file and visualize in 2d 3d graphs the euclidean distance between the sample and optimal jack ups of each r m method was calculated to find an appropriate method for jack up written in a separate file first the number of jack ups is asked from the user and a window for entering jack ups features returns where the window corresponding is opened the number of jack ups user at this point the user must read the features guide before entering their jack ups information in order to enter information correctly 4 data analysis the genetic algorithm was implemented in the matlab program the number of generations was 100 and the number of the population varied from 1000 to 15000 the results are also presented graphically in figures in the following tables selecting the best answer in the pareto chart is the min max method this method seeks to minimize the maximum distance therefore the answering process ends the best points were minimized for two three and four functions with the objective functions being cost time person hour and environment health for each r m method a graph was obtained based on its functions according to code the final answer was chosen for each method the last population answer being the optimal one for all codes the number of decision variables is 17 the maximum range of features changes is 1 and the minimum is zero except for the fifth attribute the maximum and the minimum is 1 the features are presented in table 2 at first corrective maintenance method code and then preventive maintenance method code was implemented with the following settings the result of both methods are presented in fig 2 optimal diagram and jack up information for the settings the results of the implementation are shown in fig 2 including figures and final optimal solutions in each figure each point represents a jack up as mentioned in code information the last population answers are optimal ones presented in two columns in fig 2 each column represents a jack up and each row represents different features of jack ups in fig 2a by comparing figures a21 and a22 it is interpreted that as increases number of iterations and population size the accuracy of pareto front increases and proximity of solutions shown in figures is the degree of crowding distance which is the criteria of uniformity of the pareto solutions costs and time are calculated for each answer population member answer points are well converged in fig a22 and pareto front is well distributed fig a22 has better conditions as a result the desired answer is chosen from fig a22 the points closest to the pareto line are the best answer for example 5 which is repairing in the shipyard feature is set to 0 for all conditions and other features are variable these numbers are obtained by executing code given results in the second column values of 3 13 and 14 are approximately equal to their values in the third column second column numbers are more accurate because of the larger population size for example 16 for the second column is 0 5 and the third column is 1 the values of x and y are almost the same for both columns where the x axis represents time and the y axis represents the cost the time value of the third column selected as optimal jack up for this method is 5 10998e 04 and its cost is 3 0809e 08 these numbers are optimal values for suitable jack up for correction method in fig 2b by comparing figures it is interpreted that with an increasing number of iterations and population size and number of generations pareto front accuracy has increased according to figures in the first run the answers are on the pareto line long enough and the pareto line is not complete but as the population grew the line became more complete and the answers closer together finally the answers are more accurate in fig b22 the answer points have good convergence and pareto front is well distributed optimal points were minimized for both functions according to results in the third column the value of 2 is equal to zero and it indicates jack up has three legs second column numbers are more accurate because the larger the population size so it s more accurate for example the value of 16 is 0 52 for the second column and 0 97 for the fourth column this value represents the height of the optimum jack up s drill pipe which is 21 300 feet however the values of x and y are also approximately the same for all three columns where the x axis represents cost and the y axis represents person hour the cost of the fourth column chosen as optimal jack up for this method is 3 1373370e 07 and its person hour value is 7 8029988e 07 these numbers are optimal values for a suitable jack up for the preventive method predictive maintenance method code and proactive maintenance method code were implemented with the following settings the result of both methods are presented in fig 3 optimal diagram and jack up information for the settings the results of the implementation are shown in fig 3 including figures and final optimal solutions in each figure each point represents a jack up as mentioned in code information the last population answers are optimal ones presented in two columns in fig 3 with each column representing a jack up and each row representing different features of the jack ups by comparing the result shown it can be interpreted that accuracy of the pareto front increases with an increasing number of iterations and population size relative to each other the lower distance of this answer makes up a complete line without spaces which results are optimal in fig 3a each figure consists of three parts because of having three objective functions so the graph is obtained in 3d the answers were presented separately to illustrate the relationship in row a is the person hours and time figures in row b is cost and person hours figures and in row c is cost and time figures according to figures answer points have good convergence and pareto front is well distributed in fig a33 other figures on their pareto front have gaps and less data convergence optimal points were minimized for all three functions the data in fig a33 are closer to others and represent a more complete line this is also a case in other rows the point is that since the population of fig a33 is extremely large with fig a31 and fig a32 the difference is visible in figures according to results in column 4 15000 100 the value of 1 is 0 5 so putting this in the formula in table 3 equates to the distance of 271 km from the site the fourth column numbers are more accurate because of the larger population size so it s more accurate for example the value of 17 for the second column is 0 941 and the fourth column is 0 927 this represents the optimal 3 nov 14p 220 2200 hp mud pump the values of x y and z are also nearly the same for all three columns with the x axis indicating person hour the y axis indicating time and the z axis indicating cost cost for the fourth column chosen as optimal jack up for this method is 3 0964762e 07 time value is 8 2120839e 07 and person hour value is 3 6801378e 04 there are optimal values for the jack up which is suitable for predictive methods in fig 3b settings of 1000 2000 were first considered for the proactive maintenance method because the responses were not convergent setting increased and the above results were obtained in part b each figure consists of three parts because of three objective functions and figures are obtained in three dimensional form the answers were presented separately to illustrate the relationship optimal points were minimized for all three functions according to two dimensional figures with the increase of the z axis settings it gets closer to the pareto line in row a is environment health and time figures in row b is environment health and person hour figures and in row c is time and person hour figures according to figures the data in fig b33a are less scattered as shown and they tend to build a more complete line than any other row figures the same thing can be seen in other rows rows b and c in fig b33 have more complete line data than other figures according to results obtained in the section on optimum jack up specifications for the activist method the fourth column numbers are more accurate because of larger the population size and greater accuracy for example in the fourth column 10000 100 of 7 equals 0 99 and according to table 3 the engine of this jack up is 2514 kw the value of 14 for the second column 8000 100 is 0 987 and the fourth column is 0 999 this value represents nov tds 85a top drive the optimal jack up due to table 3 the x axis represents person hour the y axis represents time and the z axis represents the cost the cost for the fourth column chosen as optimal jack up for this method is 8 9734715e 02 the time value is 7 7912815e 07 and the person hour value is 6 4412960e 04 these numbers are optimal values for suitable jack up for this method the code settings of the reliability based method are as follows where two settings are used in this method and each one repeated three times run1 pop 2000 gen 100 run2 pop 3000 gen 100 each point obtained is a jack up given that the reliability based method has four objective functions and code displays up to three objective functions on the figure the settings were repeated several times to make sure the answer was correct the last population answer is the best and optimal one presented in table 5 the results show settings did not change despite repeating settings which indicates the code s repeatability according to results in tables 5 and 3 the seventh column is 7 equal to 9 3436467e 01 the role and importance of this jack up is 0 9 cost of last column as the optimal jack up for this method is 3 1658318e 07 time value is 4 2764825e 04 its effective person hour is 8 1330757e 07 and environment health value is 5 4867412e 02 4 1 validation in this article a multi objective optimization method called pareto optimization is used to evaluate the results in the pareto front points closer to the axis of the diagram indicate more optimal solutions the solutions obtained on pareto front are divided into dominated and non dominated solutions taghizade et al 2019 after reaching a solution on the pareto front one of them needs to be selected for implementation huang 2015 the properties and functions of random variables such as mean and variance are usually accepted and are used to determine the validity of the model sargent 2013 in fig 4 the selected range of solutions was identified with red the answers were selected according to the median line and the objective functions table 7 compares the values of the solutions the value of min max median solution1 solution2 optimum solution and dominated solution are provided in table 7 the values of features of the solution are shown in table 8 and their graphs are in fig 5 the values of the features of these solutions were expected to be similar and very slight the dominated solution was selected based on the objective function for each method for example predictive maintenance method the person hour function is minimum in optimum solution the value of the person hour function is maximum for the dominated solution as shown in diagrams and according to the values of features in table 8 the answers of all methods are on the same level and there is a small difference thus some of the features and objective functions were examined for all methods in the corrective maintenance method the value of 8 helideck despite the very small difference all of them are in the same range and belong to a specific type of helideck also 7 and 11 are in the same range which are related to the features of engines and derrick comparing the optimum solution with the dominated solution many differences can be seen for example 10 is related to the cementing system according to tabl e3 the cementing system for the dominated solution is halliburton and the optimum solution is halliburton skd 4 this condition is for 4 12 and 17 which indicate the difference between optimum jack up and dominated solution the median value of cost function is 3 12e 08 and the value of cost function of solutions 1 2 are 3 10e 08 3 11e 08 the value of optimum solution cost functions is 3 08e 08 due to the proximity of values the value of optimum solution cost function for code is acceptable also the median value of time function is 4 53e 04 and the value of time function of solutions 1 2 are 4 52e 04 4 39e 04 the value of optimum solution time functions is 5 10e 04 however the value of the time function of the selected optimum solution is very different from other values the advantage of optimum solution over other solutions is less cost and less crowding distance which is one of the selected parameters of optimum solutions on the pareto front in the preventive maintenance method the value of solution features 1 and 2 does not differ from the optimum solution nevertheless the value of 10 for solution 1 is halliburton and solution 2 and optimum is 3rd party supplied because the values of solution 2 and the optimum solution are close to each other the final solution can be investigated by examining the objective functions and crowding distance by comparing the dominated and optimum solution many of features such as 3 6 9 11 and 13 are different for example 3 provides overhaul repairs every 10 years and it is for the optimum solution is every 3 years because of increasing the amount of work with equipment and not repairing them in time it will cause more damages apergis et al 2017 the median value of cost function is 7 977e 07 and the value of cost function of solutions 1 2 are 7 808e 07 7 815e 07 the value of optimum solution cost functions is 7 802e 07 due to the proximity of values the value of optimum solution cost function for code is acceptable also the median value of person hour function is 3 046e 07 and the value of time function of solutions 1 2 are 3 132e 07 3 124e 07 the value of optimum solution person hour functions is 3 137e 07 and crowding distance is 8 70292e 03 given that the closeness of values and the slight difference between them the value of cost function and person hour optimum solution selected in the code is acceptable the maximum and minimum functions depend on the type of r m method specified in code in the predictive maintenance method the features of solution 1 2 and the optimum solution are very slight for example for 1 which is related to distance from rig to the land the difference between the value of this feature in solution 1 2 and the optimum solution is very small and are in the same range the 10 is related to the cementing system are same for solutions 1 2 and optimum solution and by comparing the dominated solution the two types are different also for feature 16 the top drive of the optimum solution is varco tds 85a and the dominated solution is nov tds 85a the median value of time function is 7 99e 04 and the value of time function of solutions 1 2 are 3 97e 04 4 65e 04 the value of optimum solution time functions is 3 68e 04 the median value of person hour function is 8 225e 07 and the value of person hour function of solutions 1 2 are 8 168e 07 8 215e 07 the value of optimum solution person hour functions is 8 212e 07 also the median value of cost function is 3 127e 07 and the value of cost function of solutions 1 2 are 3 103e 07 3 095e 07 the value of optimum solution cost functions is 3 096e 07 and crowding distance is 1 99014e 04 in this method cost and time function become maximized and person hour becomes minimized given that the values are close to each other and their differences are very small the value of cost and time are less than the average value because by being less than the average the solution can be achieved the less value of person hour in the proactive maintenance method as in previous methods solutions 1 2 and optimum solution are very small differences there is more difference between the optimum solution and the dominated solution for example 9 which is related to drill depth has a depth of 20 000 ft for the dominated solution and 400 000 ft for the optimum solution also top driver 14 dominated solution is varco tds 85a and the optimal solution is nov tds 85a the median value of time function is 4 965e 04 and the value of time function of solutions 1 2 are 5 995e 04 6 559e 04 the value of optimum solution time functions is 6 441e 04 the median value of person hour function is 8 135e 07 and the value of person hour function of solutions 1 2 are 7 52e 07 7 775e 07 the value of optimum solution person hour functions is 8 973e 07 also the median value of environment health the function is 646 85 and the value of the environment health function of solutions 1 2 are 820 26 853 17 the value of optimum solution environment health functions is 897 34 and crowding distance is 3 17393e 04 the value of environment health and time function are more and the value of the person hour function is less than the average value also the crowding distance of the optimum solution is less in the reliability based maintenance method the difference between the features of solutions 1 2 and the optimum solution is slight and all of them are in the same range however these differences with the x values of the dominated solution are more for example according to 10 the top drive of solutions 1 2 and optimum ones are nov tds 85a and the dominated solution is varco tds 4h the value of time function of solutions 1 2 are 4 423e 04 5 765e 04 and optimum solution is 4 276 04 the value of person hour function of solutions 1 2 are 8 171e 07 7 907e 07 and optimum solution is 8 133e 07 also the value of cost functions solutions 1 2 are 3 046e 07 3 236e 07 and their environment health functions are 5 428e 02 4 971e 02 respectively the value of cost and environment health function of optimum solution is equal to 3 165e 07 and 5 486e 02 the optimum solution has more value time function with less value of person hour function compare to others which has increased the value of the environment health function and even has a lower crowding distance as mentioned there was a small difference between pareto s solution depending on chosen methods the max and min values of functions as well as crowding distance as an important parameter for pareto solution also all features of the solutions 1 2 and optimum solution were examined and there was no difference despite the slight differences in features of the solutions 1 2 and optimal solution they are in the same range these differences do not change the equipment and systems of jack ups as a result the logical process between the answers is confirmed based on the results the desired solutions for this project were selected the dominated solution is not the same as optimum jack ups that are determined by comparing them some features were variable in the methods which had a large effect on solutions indicating the importance of these features by examining these results choosing a jack up for each method is the logical process the aim of this optimization that enables experts and engineers to compare different options of the r m method for repairing 5 results according to the subject of the article and research method the existing r m methods were evaluated some figures were provided for each method implemented optimal solutions for each method were selected from figures a22 b22 a33 b33 and even table 5 finally an optimal solution was provided for each repair and maintenance method therefore depending on the r m method and jack up it can save time and cost as well as increase safety and better environmental protection table 6 presents optimal jack up information for each method to be used for the next step as previously stated the results from figs 2 and 3 and table 5 show optimal jack up for each r m method these answers may differ based on the amount of change in performance but a repetition of these performances does not significantly alter responses according to the purpose of the paper is choosing a proper r m method for the jack ups the issue is there are many jack ups in the world and iran they do not have the same feature features of jack ups were presented on authentic sites such as infield com etc that means a jack up may have three legs and the other one has four legs or have different engines so their repair conditions are different as a result an optimized jack up with optimization of functions cost person hour time and environmental health was chosen to continue the process for each method subsequently in another code some of the features presented in table 3 were returned to their original values and the rest were used in the same values on the other hand a code for calculating euclidean distance was developed to continue research that the features of optimized jack ups of each method wrote so users could present their jack up features to compare with optimum jack up features of each method and calculate euclidean distance the point is that the jack ups feature is used to calculate euclidean distance and objective functions are used to find optimal jack ups for each r m method as a result due to the purpose that was initially presented at the end of the research a model was developed to select the optimal method of jack ups r m as described above an optimum jack up was selected for each method then the user enters jack up information and finally the optimal method for that jack up is determined the user by examining results will find the most optimal method for rigs the most appropriate r m method for the desired jack up is one that has less distance with optimal jack up as a result the most optimal strategy for repairs is selected at the right time and cost of r m operation a method for a jack up is under repair has selected and reviewed in previous research in this study all methods except risk based were considered therefore experts can make the right decision also important safety and environmental issue which is of paramount importance today were considered to investigate the potential hazards and to minimize them minimizing casualties financial and environmental losses 6 conclusion in this paper a multi objective problem is proposed to select suitable repair and maintenance method for jack ups according to jack ups features and criteria of r m methods based on nsga ii genetic algorithm optimal results generated by the algorithm depend on many parameters such as mutation initial population size and stopping criterion in the implementation of the algorithm different combinations of population size and the total number of generations were considered so that the rate of mutation and repetition were the same a significant achievement of this research is to obtain optimal jack ups for each r m method which were obtained according to different objective functions optimal results can be obtained by testing initial parameters with a larger population and a longer time however if there is a time limit with a modest initial population acceptable answers are also obtained in this study an efficient and appropriate model for solving multi objective decision making problems for optimal repair and maintenance method selection is provided by specifying a variety of available methods criteria and seventeen features for jack up that this model can obtain an optimal r m method for each jack up based on optimal jack ups of each method and euclidean distance calculation despite some inconsistencies in some objective functions simultaneous optimization is performed in other words the proposed algorithm is a kind of decision support system for selecting jack ups r m method allowing managers to obtain results by specifying the priorities and considering the optimal r m method for jack ups and make the best decision according to the cost of repair and maintenance and the time of delivery 7 future work in reviewed articles using multi objective optimization methods for maintenance and repair has been accepted it has not yet been thoroughly investigated in the context of repair and maintenance of the rigs more research is needed in this part the concluding remarks showed that in addition to this other genetic algorithms could be developed and compared with nsga ii results also checking the result of these model need experiments and

21712,in this paper a comparison between rans simulations carried out with the k ω sst turbulence model and γ r e θ t transition model and experimental measurements for marine propeller p4119 is made the experiments were conducted at the david taylor model basin and comprehended three dimensional velocity components measurements of the blade boundary layer using a ldv system in uniform conditions the present work includes an estimation of the numerical errors that occur in the simulations analysis of the propeller blade flow chordwise and radial components of the boundary layer velocity profiles and boundary layer characteristics from this comparison and depending on the selected inlet turbulence quantities we conclude that the transition model is able to predict the extent of laminar and turbulent regions observed in the experiments moreover the predicted velocity profiles show good agreement with the experimental measurements and verified the location of transition keywords marine propeller blade boundary layer flow rans solver transition modeling 1 introduction rans reynolds averaged navier stokes solvers are becoming a widely used tool for the analysis of marine propellers both in model and full scale conditions the first applications of a rans method to investigate the scale effects on the propeller performance characteristics are attributed to uto 1993 and stanier 1998 similar studies were carried out by funeno 2002 krasilnikov et al 2009 and sánchez caja et al 2014 on the prediction of the viscous flow at different reynolds number regimes for open propellers furthermore abdel maksoud and heinke 2002 rijpkema and vaz 2011 and bulten and nijland 2011 among others analyzed the scale effects on ducted propellers in the aforementioned literature the used turbulence models were developed for the simulation of a wide range of fully turbulent engineering flows and they are not able to accurately predict transition at typical model scale reynolds numbers in eça and hoekstra 2008 several eddy viscosity turbulence models were used in the prediction of the flow over a flat plate at different reynolds numbers the comparison showed the inability of the different turbulent models to simulate transition from laminar to turbulent flow the recent developments in transitional sensitive turbulence models gave the possibility to solve the viscous flow at different reynolds numbers regimes the most popular transition sensitive turbulence models are the model proposed by walters and cokljat 2008 based on the concept of laminar kinetic energy see for instance wang and walters 2012 hasuike et al 2017 and the correlation based transition model proposed by langtry 2006 based on the concepts of intermittency γ and local transition onset momentum thickness reynolds number r e θ t since the full release to the scientific community langtry and menter 2009 the γ r e θ t is becoming a very popular model for the simulation of transitional flows several applications of the γ r e θ t transition model to marine propellers may be found in bhattacharyya et al 2016a shin and andersen 2017 moran guerrero et al 2018 and yao and zhang 2018 in these studies a significant improvement is observed in the comparison between rans simulations and model tests performed without forced transition a better agreement is obtained for the propeller forces and also in the occurrence of flow transition and its location from the comparison with paint tests therefore the γ r e θ t transition model opens the opportunity to improve the modeling of transitional flows using rans solvers traditionally the prediction of scale effects is based on simple extrapolation procedures from model scale experiments carried out in a towing tank or cavitation tunnel at present the most common procedure is the 1978 ittc performance prediction method ittc 1978 2017 alternatively the combination of increased computational power and the recent developments in turbulence modeling makes the rans solver a viable tool for the prediction of the scale effects scaling approaches based on the rans simulations have been proposed by müller et al 2009 and bhattacharyya et al 2016b for open and ducted propellers respectively the flow over the propeller at model scale reynolds numbers is mostly in the critical reynolds number regime where laminar transition and turbulent flow regimes may occur simultaneously visualization of the flow at these reynolds numbers for example with the help of paint tests typically shows regions of laminar and turbulent flow on the blade as for example discussed in kuiper 1981 the character of the boundary layer on the suction side of a propeller blade at model scale reynolds number is illustrated schematically in fig 1 for the upper radii a b a short laminar separation bubble due to a strong adverse pressure gradient is present near the leading edge making the boundary layer turbulent over the rest of the chord the separation radius at which the short laminar separation bubble occurs is found at b c the region c d shows a laminar flow region with transition to turbulent flow downstream the chordwise position of the transition region depends on the reynolds number but is generally located at some distance from the leading edge at the lower radii d e a laminar separation region can be observed due to the very low sectional reynolds number in combination with thicker root sections therefore for an accurate prediction of the performance characteristics at both model and full scales with a rans solver the selected model for turbulence closure must have the ability to simulate different flow regimes including transition since a different boundary layer structure of the flow over the blades arises from the change in reynolds number fig 1 the k ω sst shear stress transport turbulence model menter et al 2003 is currently one of the most widely used turbulence models for marine propeller applications however fully turbulent boundary layers are assumed all over the blade surface and consequently do not obtain accurate predictions that can be compared to experimental results rijpkema et al 2015 analyzed model scale propellers using two different eddy viscosity turbulence models the comparison with paint tests showed that the predicted limiting streamlines are more circumferentially oriented for all radii which indicates an overestimation of the turbulent flow region therefore the γ r e θ t transition model proposed by langtry and menter 2009 may be seen as an alternative to improve the propeller performance prediction at model scale in a previous study the k ω sst turbulence model and the γ r e θ t transition model were combined with a rans solver for two marine propellers for which paint tests have been conducted and experimental open water data is available baltazar et al 2018 the analysis of the numerical simulations focused on a qualitative comparison between the limiting streamlines and paint tests observations and propeller force prediction in open water conditions from this study an improvement in the blade boundary layer flow is obtained with the transition model whereas the simulations with the turbulence model predict a too large turbulent region on the blade alternatively the experimental study of the laminar turbulent flow in the vicinity of a rotating propeller blade conducted by jessup 1989 may be used for a better quantitative comparison and understanding of the blade boundary layer flow the experiments were carried out in the david taylor model basin dtmb 24 in water tunnel about marine propeller p4119 where two blades were applied with leading edge roughness and the remaining was smooth the experiments comprehended three dimensional velocity component measurements of the blade boundary layer and wake using a ldv system in uniform inflow conditions from these experimental measurements a comparison with the numerical results obtained from a rans solver using the k ω sst turbulence model and γ r e θ t transition model is presented in this paper the present work includes an estimation of the numerical errors involved in the simulations analysis of the propeller blade flow chordwise and radial components of the boundary layer velocities and boundary layer characteristics from this study and depending on the selected inlet turbulence quantities the γ r e θ t transition model is able to predict the extent of laminar and turbulent regions observed in the experiments this paper is organized as follows the numerical method including the turbulence and transition models is presented in section 2 the propeller geometry grid generation scheme computational domain and boundary conditions are described in section 3 the comparison between the numerical results and the experimental measurements is shown in section 4 in section 5 the main conclusions are drawn 2 numerical method 2 1 rans equations the rans equations are solved using a so called absolute formulation this means that the flow velocity u i with i 1 2 3 or u x u y u z is defined in the absolute or inertial earth fixed frame of reference with the equations being solved in the propeller fixed frame of reference x i which is rotating with angular velocity ω this allows to perform steady simulations for open water conditions for the absolute velocity formulation the rans equations for a steadily rotating frame and using the boussinesq eddy viscosity hypothesis may be written in the following form 1 u i x i 0 v j u i x j ε i j k ω j u k 1 ρ p x i x j ν ν t u i x j u j x i where v i represents the i th cartesian component of the velocity vector defined in the propeller fixed frame of reference p the modified pressure defined as p p 2 3 ρ k p the static pressure k the turbulence kinetic energy ρ the fluid density ν and ν t the kinematic and turbulent viscosities respectively and ε the levi civita symbol in this formulation the momentum equations contain only one source term ε i j k ω j u k 2 2 turbulence and transition models in the present work the k ω sst turbulence model and the γ r e θ t transition model are chosen for turbulence closure the k ω sst turbulence model is a widely used and robust two equation turbulence model the variables of the model are the turbulence kinetic energy k and the turbulence dissipation rate ω this model was originally introduced in 1994 by menter to deal with the strong sensitivity to the free stream conditions of the original k ω turbulence model and to improve the prediction of the boundary layer flow with adverse pressure gradients menter 1994 in the present work the 2003 version of the k ω sst model is used menter et al 2003 the transport equations to calculate the modeled turbulence kinetic energy and turbulence dissipation rate are 2 v j k x j p k d k x j ν σ k ν t k x j v j ω x j p ω d ω x j ν σ ω ν t ω x j 2 1 f 1 σ ω 2 ω k x j ω x j with the turbulent viscosity defined as 3 ν t a 1 k max a 1 ω s f 2 where p k and d k are the production and dissipation terms of the turbulence kinetic energy respectively p ω and d ω the production and dissipation terms of the turbulence dissipation rate respectively s is the strain rate magnitude f 1 and f 2 auxiliary functions and a 1 σ k σ ω and σ ω 2 are constants of the model the complete model and constant values are given in menter et al 2003 the γ r e θ t transition model proposed by langtry and menter 2009 is coupled with the k ω sst turbulence model of menter et al 2003 for the simulation of the flow around the marine propeller at model scale including transition this transition model contains two transport equations and accounts for transition due to free stream turbulence intensity pressure gradients and separation one is a transport equation for intermittency γ 4 v j γ x j p γ e γ x j ν ν t σ f γ x j where p γ and e γ are the production and relaminarisation terms respectively the blending between the laminar and turbulent flow regimes is made by the intermittency which changes between zero and one respectively in the present formulation the intermittency is also set equal to one in the freestream instead of a small value as in the original model menter et al 2002 the second one is a transport equation for the local transition onset momentum thickness reynolds number r e θ t 5 v j r e θ t x j p θ t x j σ θ t ν ν t r e θ t x j which only includes a production term p θ t the terms p γ e γ and p θ t and the constants σ f and σ θ t are given in langtry and menter 2009 the coupling between the k ω sst turbulence model and the γ r e θ t transition model is made by an effective intermittency γ eff which is used to control the production and dissipation terms in the k transport equation eq 2 the definition of the turbulent viscosity of the k ω sst turbulence model remains unchanged this model is also sometimes known as the γ r e θ t sst model because it makes use of the equations for γ and r e θ t in addition to the k and ω equations of the sst turbulence model menter et al 2003 therefore this model corresponds to a four equation transition sst turbulence model 2 3 flow solver the rans equations are solved using the refresco code developed within a cooperation led by marin for hydrodynamic applications refresco 2019 a finite volume technique with cell centered collocated variables is used for solving the equations a pressure correction equation based on the simple algorithm is used to ensure mass conservation a segregated approach is adopted here for the solution of all transport equations the implementation is face based which permits grids with elements consisting of an arbitrary number of faces for the convective flux terms a second order scheme quick is applied for the momentum equations and a first order upwind scheme is applied for the k ω sst turbulence model and γ r e θ t transition model in this study refresco version 2 3 is used 3 propeller geometry and numerical set up the marine propeller p4119 is considered in the present study the propeller has three blades a diameter of 0 305 m and an expanded area ratio of 0 5 the pitch diameter ratio and chord length at 0 7 of the propeller radius are 1 084 and 0 141 m respectively the propeller has no skew or rake for this propeller six nearly geometrically similar multi block structured grids are generated using the commercial grid generation software gridpro gridpro 2019 the grids for the entire propeller range from 900 thousand to 37 6 million cells in table 1 the number of cells in the volume and on a single blade and the maximum dimensionless wall distance of the first cell height y are listed for each grid a fine boundary layer resolution is obtained since the maximum y is lower than one for all grids therefore the boundary layer is fully resolved and no wall functions are used an overview of the grid with 37 6 million cells is presented in fig 2 a cylindrical domain is considered where the inlet the outlet and the outer boundary are located ten propeller radii from the domain origin a schematic overview of the computational domain and its boundaries is presented in fig 3 where r denotes the propeller radius the prescribed boundary conditions in the present work are the following at the inlet the uniform velocity and the turbulence level depending on the turbulence model are prescribed while the pressure is extrapolated from the interior assuming zero normal derivative neumann boundary condition at the outlet an outflow condition of zero normal derivative is prescribed for all flow variables at the outer boundary a constant pressure is set while a neumann boundary condition is used for all other variables for the propeller blades and hub no slip and impermeability conditions are applied at the surface and neumann boundary conditions are used for the pressure p intermittency γ and local transition onset momentum thickness reynolds number r e θ t in addition the turbulence kinetic energy k is set equal to zero and ω is specified at the near wall cell center menter 1994 in this study the turbulence level is specified at the inlet from the turbulence intensity t u 100 2 k 3 v a 2 and eddy viscosity ratio ν t ν where v a is the incoming flow velocity and equal to the propeller advance speed due to the strong dependence of the γ r e θ t transition model on the inlet turbulence quantities t u 1 2 and 1 5 and ν t ν 500 at the inlet boundary are specified the choice of these inlet turbulence quantities is based on a previous study baltazar et al 2018 where the γ r e θ t transition model has been used for the flow simulation on two marine propellers at model scale and the results have been compared with paint tests table 2 presents the turbulence intensity and eddy viscosity ratio at the inlet boundary x r 10 and plane x r 1 upstream of the propeller at the radial section r r 0 7 the results show that the large value selected for the eddy viscosity ratio ν t ν 500 is crucial in the control of the turbulence decay from the inlet boundary to the propeller plane spalart and rumsey 2007 and therefore in the prediction of transition occurrence and location for the k ω sst turbulence model standard values i e t u 1 0 and ν t ν 1 are assumed at the inlet boundary in this case and as shown in baltazar et al 2018 the influence of the inlet turbulence quantities on the propeller simulations is negligible 4 results 4 1 general results are presented for the marine propeller p4119 in open water conditions the propeller open water characteristics are expressed by the advance coefficient j thrust and torque coefficients k t k q and the open water efficiency η 0 as follows 6 j v a n d k t t ρ n 2 d 4 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 η 0 j 2 π k t k q where n ω 2 π is the rotation rate in rps d the propeller diameter t the propeller thrust and q the propeller torque other useful quantities are the pressure coefficient c p and the skin friction coefficient c f defined as 7 c p p p 1 2 ρ v ref 2 c f τ w 1 2 ρ v a 2 where p is the undisturbed static pressure here defined at the inlet boundary τ w is the local wall shear stress and v ref v a 2 ω r 2 is a reference velocity defined as the undisturbed onset velocity at the radial position r the use of the propeller advance speed on the definition of the skin friction coefficient allows a better identification of the transition location over the entire propeller blade whereas for the pressure coefficient the analysis is carried out at different radial sections and the standard definition based on the undisturbed onset velocity to those sections considered the rans simulations are compared with open water tests and ldv measurements of the blade boundary layer that were performed in the dtmb 24 in water tunnel the propeller was tested at 10 rps at an advance coefficient of j 0 833 corresponding to a reynolds number of 9 5 1 0 5 based on chord length c 0 7 r and inflow velocity v 0 7 r v a 2 0 7 r ω 2 at 0 7 of the propeller radius r 4 2 numerical errors in cfd computational fluid dynamics methods the three main contributions to the numerical error are round off error iterative error and discretization error oberkampf and roy 2010 since double precision is used in the present calculations the round off error is neglected therefore an analysis of the iterative and discretization errors involved in the present computations is shown in this section first the iterative error is analyzed for the rans simulations with the k ω sst turbulence model and γ r e θ t transition model for the γ r e θ t transition model the inflow turbulence quantities are set to 1 5 and 500 for the t u and ν t ν respectively the iterative error is estimated from the norms of the residuals of the momentum equations pressure correction and transport equations of the turbulence and transition models in this work we have adopted the l norm 8 l max res ϕ i 1 i n cells where n cells is the total number of grid cells and res ϕ refers to the residuals of the equations for any local flow quantity ϕ complementary the l 2 norm of the residuals is also studied 9 l 2 i 1 n cells res 2 ϕ i n cells the residuals are made non dimensional using the reference variables c 0 7 r v 0 7 r and p the l and l 2 norms of the residuals for the cartesian components of the flow velocity u x y z modified static pressure p turbulence kinetic energy k specific turbulence dissipation rate ω intermittency γ and local transition onset momentum thickness reynolds number r e θ t for the grid with 37 6 million cells g1 as a function of the number of iterations are plotted in fig 4 in this study a convergence criterion of 10 6 has been adopted for the l and l 2 norms of the flow quantities the analysis of the results obtained with the k ω sst turbulence model shows that convergence of the l and l 2 norms is obtained for all quantities however iterative convergence is not achieved for the γ r e θ t transition model in the transition region and depending on the local refinement level the intermittency may have abrupt changes and since is limited between zero and one this had led to maximum residuals of the order of 10 1 due to the jump between the laminar and turbulent regimes nonetheless this corresponds to a l 2 norm of the γ residual below 10 4 for the remaining quantities a l 2 error norm below 10 6 is achieved in the fully turbulent computations a large number of iterations is needed to obtain normalized residuals below than 10 6 this results in 80000 iterations since in the transition model computations the normalized residuals stagnate after 20000 iterations the computational effort is lower the extra computational cost of the turbulence model calculations is around 70 compared to the transition model solution in order to understand the influence of the iterative convergence on the propeller forces the variation of the thrust and torque coefficients with the number of iterations is presented in fig 5 for the propeller forces using the γ r e θ t transition model iterative convergence is achieved after 7000 iterations when the l and l 2 norms of the flow quantities have not yet stagnated in this sense a minor effect of the iterative error is expected on the prediction of the propeller coefficients the discretization error is estimated following the procedure described in eça and hoekstra 2014 in this procedure the discretization error is estimated based on the truncated power series expansion 10 ϕ i ϕ 0 α h i p where ϕ i is a quantity of interest obtained on grid i ϕ 0 is an estimate of the exact solution α is a constant h i is the typical cell size of grid i and p is the observed order of grid convergence since the grids are block structured and the same coarsening factor is applied on each direction the typical cell size of grid i is determined from the total number of grid cells n cells by h i 1 n cells 1 3 the unknown coefficients in eq 10 are determined from a least square fit of the numerical solutions for the six grids the error estimate is then converted into a numerical uncertainty u num which is meant to provide a 95 confidence interval the estimated uncertainty depends on the estimated discretization error ϕ i ϕ 0 the standard deviation of the fit and the difference between the real data point and the value obtained from the fit for the same grid density the complete procedure is described in eça and hoekstra 2014 the results of the numerical uncertainty estimation for the propeller forces are plotted in fig 6 the plots include also the fits and the apparent orders of convergence the numerical uncertainties are evidenced by the error bars for the two finest grids 21 and 37 6 million cells calculations were run for two days in parallel using 128 cpus at the marin cluster for the remaining grid sizes the calculations were performed overnight in parallel on a 16 cpu linux computer with the exception of the k t predicted by the γ r e θ t transition model numerical uncertainties lower than 1 are obtained in these cases near first order convergence is obtained for the thrust coefficient predicted with the k ω sst turbulence model and near second order convergence is obtained for the torque coefficient for the k t predicted by the γ r e θ t transition model the three coarsest grids deviate from the trend and are omitted from the least square fit in this case first order convergence is obtained and the uncertainty in the thrust coefficient is 1 since this study comprehends the analysis of local flow quantities the convergence with grid refinement of the pressure and skin friction coefficients at non dimensional chordwise locations s c 0 2 and 0 7 on the blade suction side are analyzed in fig 7 some cases do not show monotonic convergence in general apparent orders of convergence between 1 and 2 are obtained from the least square fits one exception is obtained for the c f at s c 0 7 using the γ r e θ t transition model where p 0 6 lower numerical uncertainties are obtained with the k ω sst turbulence model we note that large numerical uncertainties are estimated for the skin friction coefficient with the γ r e θ t transition model for sake of completeness the apparent orders of convergence and estimated numerical uncertainties are summarized in table 3 the discretization errors estimated from the least square fits ϕ 1 ϕ 0 are also presented in the table in general larger discretization errors are estimated for the γ r e θ t transition model since not only global quantities but also local flow quantities are analyzed and compared with the experimental results the influence of the grid density on the propeller forces and blade boundary layer velocity profiles are discussed the variation of the thrust and torque coefficients and open water efficiency for each grid compared to the finest grid is listed in table 4 differences lower than 1 are obtained for the grid with 9 9 million cells g3 fig 8 presents the chordwise component v s of the blade boundary layer velocity profile on the suction side at 0 5 of the chord length and 0 7 of the propeller radius results of all grid sizes are compared for both models the velocity profile is presented along the normal direction where y is the wall distance to blade surface and c the chord length a minor influence of the grid refinement level on the blade velocity profiles predicted by the k ω sst turbulence model is observed however convergence of the γ r e θ t transition model velocity profiles is difficult to obtain the maximum differences in the velocity profile between the grids with 9 9 million cells and 37 6 million cells are of the order of 4 the results show that fine grids are required to capture the flow details therefore the results obtained with the finest grid 37 6 million cells are considered for the analysis of the blade flow and comparison with experimental data 4 3 propeller blade flow in this section the propeller blade flow predictions using the turbulence and transition models are examined for the analysis of the different flow solutions the limiting streamlines and skin friction coefficient c f on the blade surface are presented in fig 9 the location where flow transition occurs is identified by the sudden rise of the skin friction distribution and the change in the orientation of the limiting streamlines towards the chordwise direction the results obtained with the γ r e θ t transition model present a laminar flow region with transition to turbulent flow at some distance from the leading edge a strong sensitivity to the inlet turbulence quantities in the prediction of laminar to turbulent transition is observed the domain of laminar flow reduces with the increase of the turbulence intensity at the inlet as expected the k ω sst turbulence model leads to turbulent flow on the propeller blades in this case a short laminar flow region is present along the leading edge this comparison shows that detailed experimental information is crucial for the selection of the inlet turbulence quantities when using the γ r e θ t transition model the predicted open water characteristics including the pressure and friction contributions to the force coefficients are compared with the experimental results in table 5 due to the growth in the turbulent flow region an increase in the magnitude of the friction contribution is observed at the same time a decrease in the pressure contribution is observed which may be explained by a decambering effect due to a thicker boundary layer a better agreement with the experimental torque coefficient is obtained with the k ω sst turbulence model for the thrust coefficient and open water efficiency a better agreement with the experimental data is obtained for the γ r e θ t transition model with t u 1 5 and ν t ν 500 at the inlet boundary in addition to the propeller forces the predicted blade pressure distribution is compared with experimental measurements since the pressure distributions presented in jessup 1989 were derived from the measured chordwise and radial velocity components at the boundary layer edge a similar approach is considered in this study for the rans simulations following jessup 1989 the pressure coefficient is calculated by 11 c p 1 v s v ref 2 v r v ref 2 with v ref v a 2 ω r 2 where v s and v r are the chordwise and radial velocity components in the propeller frame of reference calculated at the edge of the boundary layer δ respectively the estimated boundary layer thickness δ is obtained from the total pressure loss δ p t in the propeller frame of reference and is calculated as follows 12 δ p t p 1 2 ρ v x 2 v y 2 v z 2 p inlet 1 2 ρ v a 2 ω r 2 with p inlet p 2 3 ρ k inlet which results in a negative variation of the total pressure inside the boundary layer in the present work the boundary layer thickness is defined by the distance normal to the wall to a point where the total pressure loss coefficient c δ p t δ p t 1 2 ρ v ref 2 is equal to 0 01 corresponding approximately to the definition of 99 5 of the free stream velocity at that point the comparison between the calculated pressure distributions with the turbulence and transition models and the experimental data is presented at the radial sections r r 0 3 0 7 and 0 9 in fig 10 the non dimensional chordwise location is defined as s c similar results are obtained between the turbulence model and transition model a reasonable to good agreement between the numerical results and the experimental data is obtained at the radial sections r r 0 7 and 0 9 at the radial section r r 0 3 some discrepancies between the calculations and experiments are visible in the pressure distribution the larger disagreement observed at r r 0 3 in comparison with the other radial sections may be due to the boundary layer thickness corrections applied by jessup 1989 to the chordwise location of the measurements this correction is especially important towards the blade root due to the thicker blade sections the values larger than 1 0 obtained at the trailing edge indicate lack of accuracy in the determination of the measured chordwise positions in addition some differences are observed near the blade leading edge for all radial sections jessup 1989 suggested that these differences may be due to errors in the geometry model 4 4 comparison of velocity profiles in this section a comparison of the velocity profiles in the blade boundary layer between the rans simulations and the experiments is made the chordwise v s and radial v r components of the flow velocity were measured by a ldv system comprising a one component lens system with a fiber optic probe the measurement volume formed by the interception of the two transmission beams is placed tangential to the blade surface at each measurement point as the propeller rotates velocity measurements along the boundary layer are acquired the chordwise and radial velocity components are measured by setting the plane that contains the transmission beams tangentially or perpendicularly to the blade surface respectively in order to fully capture the large flow gradients near the blades a measurement volume characterized by a reference length of approximately 0 075 mm was used seeding particles were added to the flow to improve signal to noise ratio in the propeller model two blades had leading edges roughened with 60 μ m distributed roughness and the other blade was smooth jessup 1989 figs 11 to 13 show the chordwise and radial boundary layer velocity profiles at 0 7 of the propeller radius developed on the suction and pressure sides at different chordwise locations respectively in addition figs 14 and 15 show the chordwise and radial boundary layer velocity profiles developed at the 0 9 radius respectively these profiles are shown in the propeller fixed frame of reference the numerical predictions are compared with the experimental boundary layer profiles measured on the smooth and tripped blades the legends present the estimated boundary layer thicknesses of the numerical results the grid resolution inside the blade boundary layer consists of more than 30 layers with an expansion ratio of 1 2 along the direction normal to the blade surface from the streamwise measurements at 0 7 of the propeller radius the smooth blade appears to have transitioned on the suction side by 0 7 of the chord in this case the best agreement with the smooth blade measurements is obtained for the γ r e θ t transition model with t u 1 2 before transition after transition a better match is obtained for the γ r e θ t transition model with t u 1 5 on the pressure side the best agreement is achieved for the γ r e θ t transition model with t u 1 5 since the results with t u 1 2 predict a too large laminar flow region the suction side radial profiles at 0 7 radius on the smooth blade predicted by the γ r e θ t transition model with t u 1 2 are also laminar showing a very large outward radial flow near the wall at s c 0 77 the measured outward radial flow reduces significantly and a better agreement is obtained with γ r e θ t transition model using t u 1 5 from the measurements on the smooth blade at 0 9 of the propeller radius transition seems to occur between 0 3 and 0 4 of the section chord the streamwise velocity profiles obtained from the γ r e θ t transition model with both t u 1 2 and 1 5 show that transition is predicted at more aft chord locations the measured radial profiles on the smooth blade show small outward flow near the wall similar profile shapes are obtained with the γ r e θ t transition model using t u 1 5 the velocity profiles predicted by the k ω sst turbulence model approach the measurements on the tripped blade however inflected profiles are obtained at the chordwise positions close to the leading edge from the tripped blade measurements at 0 7 of the propeller radius according to jessup 1989 these discrepancies are attributed to the influence of the leading edge roughness on the blade flow for the radial section 0 9 the tripped blade shows a turbulent profile at 0 3 chord without the inflection these variations may be due to the amount of distributed roughness along the radial direction jessup 1989 4 5 boundary layer characteristics from the predicted velocity profiles the boundary layer thickness δ displacement thickness δ and shape factor h are calculated and represented in figs 16 and 17 in this work the boundary layer parameters are predicted from the streamwise velocity profiles and the integrals estimated by numerical integration from the wall to the boundary layer thickness the predicted displacement thickness and shape factor are also compared with the calculations of jessup 1989 from the measured velocity profiles the evolution of the boundary layer thickness along the chordwise direction shows the increase in thickness due to transition from laminar to turbulent flow regime for the displacement thickness and shape factor agreement between the numerical simulations and the experimentally determined boundary layer parameters is difficult to obtain in general the results obtained for the k ω sst turbulence model approach the experimental values of the tripped blade the same trend is observed between the γ r e θ t transition model and the smooth blade experiments in general a better agreement is obtained with t u 1 5 however as previously discussed in the analysis of the velocity profiles the agreement at 0 7 of the propeller radius on the suction side improves with t u 1 2 the experimental and numerical shape factors show large values in the laminar flow region which reduce to turbulent profile values around 1 4 typical of two dimensional flows the drops observed in the shape factor with the development of the boundary layer correlate well with the estimated transition locations based on the velocity profiles 5 conclusions in this paper a comparison between rans calculations and experimental data has been presented the analysis is carried out for marine propeller p4119 for which three dimensional velocity component measurements on the blade boundary layer are available at model scale in the model propeller two blades had rough leading edges and the other blade was smooth for the rans calculations two models are considered the commonly used k ω sst eddy viscosity turbulence model and the γ r e θ t transition model the influence of the iterative errors discretization errors and boundary conditions on the propeller flow predictions has been analyzed the γ r e θ t transition model does not satisfy the iterative convergence criterion still its influence on the propeller forces is assumed to be small due to the fast convergence of the thrust and torque coefficients the numerical uncertainty of the propeller forces integral quantities and pressure and skin friction coefficients local quantities has been determined from an estimation of the discretization error based on systematically refined grids low numerical uncertainties less than 2 are obtained for the propeller force coefficients for the local quantities small numerical uncertainties less than 4 are predicted with the k ω sst turbulence model for the γ r e θ t transition model larger uncertainties are obtained more than 9 especially for the skin friction coefficient the numerical predictions of the velocity profiles have been compared with blade boundary layer measurements an agreement is found between the turbulent velocity profile predicted by the k ω sst turbulence model and the measured velocities from the tripped blade for the γ r e θ t transition model the agreement with the smooth blade velocity measurements is highly dependent on the inlet turbulence quantities in this work from the selected inlet turbulence quantities a qualitative agreement is obtained for the blade boundary layer velocity profiles however this information may not be available which limits the predictive capabilities of the γ r e θ t transition model at model scale specially because the selected inlet values are not realistic from the physical point of view finally boundary layer integral quantities obtained from the measured and computed velocity profiles have been analyzed the evolution of these quantities along the chordwise direction shows typical laminar and turbulent flow behaviors the comparison between the rans calculations and the experimental measurements shows that the considered models can be used not only for the prediction of integral quantities but also for the analysis of the local features of the propeller blade flow nevertheless the selection of the inlet turbulence quantities is crucial in the prediction of the transition location and in the accuracy of the model scale propeller performance prediction therefore the assessment of the predictive capabilities of the γ r e θ t transition model requires the analyses of not only the propeller forces but also of the blade boundary layer flow for the identification of transition location credit authorship contribution statement joão baltazar

21712,in this paper a comparison between rans simulations carried out with the k ω sst turbulence model and γ r e θ t transition model and experimental measurements for marine propeller p4119 is made the experiments were conducted at the david taylor model basin and comprehended three dimensional velocity components measurements of the blade boundary layer using a ldv system in uniform conditions the present work includes an estimation of the numerical errors that occur in the simulations analysis of the propeller blade flow chordwise and radial components of the boundary layer velocity profiles and boundary layer characteristics from this comparison and depending on the selected inlet turbulence quantities we conclude that the transition model is able to predict the extent of laminar and turbulent regions observed in the experiments moreover the predicted velocity profiles show good agreement with the experimental measurements and verified the location of transition keywords marine propeller blade boundary layer flow rans solver transition modeling 1 introduction rans reynolds averaged navier stokes solvers are becoming a widely used tool for the analysis of marine propellers both in model and full scale conditions the first applications of a rans method to investigate the scale effects on the propeller performance characteristics are attributed to uto 1993 and stanier 1998 similar studies were carried out by funeno 2002 krasilnikov et al 2009 and sánchez caja et al 2014 on the prediction of the viscous flow at different reynolds number regimes for open propellers furthermore abdel maksoud and heinke 2002 rijpkema and vaz 2011 and bulten and nijland 2011 among others analyzed the scale effects on ducted propellers in the aforementioned literature the used turbulence models were developed for the simulation of a wide range of fully turbulent engineering flows and they are not able to accurately predict transition at typical model scale reynolds numbers in eça and hoekstra 2008 several eddy viscosity turbulence models were used in the prediction of the flow over a flat plate at different reynolds numbers the comparison showed the inability of the different turbulent models to simulate transition from laminar to turbulent flow the recent developments in transitional sensitive turbulence models gave the possibility to solve the viscous flow at different reynolds numbers regimes the most popular transition sensitive turbulence models are the model proposed by walters and cokljat 2008 based on the concept of laminar kinetic energy see for instance wang and walters 2012 hasuike et al 2017 and the correlation based transition model proposed by langtry 2006 based on the concepts of intermittency γ and local transition onset momentum thickness reynolds number r e θ t since the full release to the scientific community langtry and menter 2009 the γ r e θ t is becoming a very popular model for the simulation of transitional flows several applications of the γ r e θ t transition model to marine propellers may be found in bhattacharyya et al 2016a shin and andersen 2017 moran guerrero et al 2018 and yao and zhang 2018 in these studies a significant improvement is observed in the comparison between rans simulations and model tests performed without forced transition a better agreement is obtained for the propeller forces and also in the occurrence of flow transition and its location from the comparison with paint tests therefore the γ r e θ t transition model opens the opportunity to improve the modeling of transitional flows using rans solvers traditionally the prediction of scale effects is based on simple extrapolation procedures from model scale experiments carried out in a towing tank or cavitation tunnel at present the most common procedure is the 1978 ittc performance prediction method ittc 1978 2017 alternatively the combination of increased computational power and the recent developments in turbulence modeling makes the rans solver a viable tool for the prediction of the scale effects scaling approaches based on the rans simulations have been proposed by müller et al 2009 and bhattacharyya et al 2016b for open and ducted propellers respectively the flow over the propeller at model scale reynolds numbers is mostly in the critical reynolds number regime where laminar transition and turbulent flow regimes may occur simultaneously visualization of the flow at these reynolds numbers for example with the help of paint tests typically shows regions of laminar and turbulent flow on the blade as for example discussed in kuiper 1981 the character of the boundary layer on the suction side of a propeller blade at model scale reynolds number is illustrated schematically in fig 1 for the upper radii a b a short laminar separation bubble due to a strong adverse pressure gradient is present near the leading edge making the boundary layer turbulent over the rest of the chord the separation radius at which the short laminar separation bubble occurs is found at b c the region c d shows a laminar flow region with transition to turbulent flow downstream the chordwise position of the transition region depends on the reynolds number but is generally located at some distance from the leading edge at the lower radii d e a laminar separation region can be observed due to the very low sectional reynolds number in combination with thicker root sections therefore for an accurate prediction of the performance characteristics at both model and full scales with a rans solver the selected model for turbulence closure must have the ability to simulate different flow regimes including transition since a different boundary layer structure of the flow over the blades arises from the change in reynolds number fig 1 the k ω sst shear stress transport turbulence model menter et al 2003 is currently one of the most widely used turbulence models for marine propeller applications however fully turbulent boundary layers are assumed all over the blade surface and consequently do not obtain accurate predictions that can be compared to experimental results rijpkema et al 2015 analyzed model scale propellers using two different eddy viscosity turbulence models the comparison with paint tests showed that the predicted limiting streamlines are more circumferentially oriented for all radii which indicates an overestimation of the turbulent flow region therefore the γ r e θ t transition model proposed by langtry and menter 2009 may be seen as an alternative to improve the propeller performance prediction at model scale in a previous study the k ω sst turbulence model and the γ r e θ t transition model were combined with a rans solver for two marine propellers for which paint tests have been conducted and experimental open water data is available baltazar et al 2018 the analysis of the numerical simulations focused on a qualitative comparison between the limiting streamlines and paint tests observations and propeller force prediction in open water conditions from this study an improvement in the blade boundary layer flow is obtained with the transition model whereas the simulations with the turbulence model predict a too large turbulent region on the blade alternatively the experimental study of the laminar turbulent flow in the vicinity of a rotating propeller blade conducted by jessup 1989 may be used for a better quantitative comparison and understanding of the blade boundary layer flow the experiments were carried out in the david taylor model basin dtmb 24 in water tunnel about marine propeller p4119 where two blades were applied with leading edge roughness and the remaining was smooth the experiments comprehended three dimensional velocity component measurements of the blade boundary layer and wake using a ldv system in uniform inflow conditions from these experimental measurements a comparison with the numerical results obtained from a rans solver using the k ω sst turbulence model and γ r e θ t transition model is presented in this paper the present work includes an estimation of the numerical errors involved in the simulations analysis of the propeller blade flow chordwise and radial components of the boundary layer velocities and boundary layer characteristics from this study and depending on the selected inlet turbulence quantities the γ r e θ t transition model is able to predict the extent of laminar and turbulent regions observed in the experiments this paper is organized as follows the numerical method including the turbulence and transition models is presented in section 2 the propeller geometry grid generation scheme computational domain and boundary conditions are described in section 3 the comparison between the numerical results and the experimental measurements is shown in section 4 in section 5 the main conclusions are drawn 2 numerical method 2 1 rans equations the rans equations are solved using a so called absolute formulation this means that the flow velocity u i with i 1 2 3 or u x u y u z is defined in the absolute or inertial earth fixed frame of reference with the equations being solved in the propeller fixed frame of reference x i which is rotating with angular velocity ω this allows to perform steady simulations for open water conditions for the absolute velocity formulation the rans equations for a steadily rotating frame and using the boussinesq eddy viscosity hypothesis may be written in the following form 1 u i x i 0 v j u i x j ε i j k ω j u k 1 ρ p x i x j ν ν t u i x j u j x i where v i represents the i th cartesian component of the velocity vector defined in the propeller fixed frame of reference p the modified pressure defined as p p 2 3 ρ k p the static pressure k the turbulence kinetic energy ρ the fluid density ν and ν t the kinematic and turbulent viscosities respectively and ε the levi civita symbol in this formulation the momentum equations contain only one source term ε i j k ω j u k 2 2 turbulence and transition models in the present work the k ω sst turbulence model and the γ r e θ t transition model are chosen for turbulence closure the k ω sst turbulence model is a widely used and robust two equation turbulence model the variables of the model are the turbulence kinetic energy k and the turbulence dissipation rate ω this model was originally introduced in 1994 by menter to deal with the strong sensitivity to the free stream conditions of the original k ω turbulence model and to improve the prediction of the boundary layer flow with adverse pressure gradients menter 1994 in the present work the 2003 version of the k ω sst model is used menter et al 2003 the transport equations to calculate the modeled turbulence kinetic energy and turbulence dissipation rate are 2 v j k x j p k d k x j ν σ k ν t k x j v j ω x j p ω d ω x j ν σ ω ν t ω x j 2 1 f 1 σ ω 2 ω k x j ω x j with the turbulent viscosity defined as 3 ν t a 1 k max a 1 ω s f 2 where p k and d k are the production and dissipation terms of the turbulence kinetic energy respectively p ω and d ω the production and dissipation terms of the turbulence dissipation rate respectively s is the strain rate magnitude f 1 and f 2 auxiliary functions and a 1 σ k σ ω and σ ω 2 are constants of the model the complete model and constant values are given in menter et al 2003 the γ r e θ t transition model proposed by langtry and menter 2009 is coupled with the k ω sst turbulence model of menter et al 2003 for the simulation of the flow around the marine propeller at model scale including transition this transition model contains two transport equations and accounts for transition due to free stream turbulence intensity pressure gradients and separation one is a transport equation for intermittency γ 4 v j γ x j p γ e γ x j ν ν t σ f γ x j where p γ and e γ are the production and relaminarisation terms respectively the blending between the laminar and turbulent flow regimes is made by the intermittency which changes between zero and one respectively in the present formulation the intermittency is also set equal to one in the freestream instead of a small value as in the original model menter et al 2002 the second one is a transport equation for the local transition onset momentum thickness reynolds number r e θ t 5 v j r e θ t x j p θ t x j σ θ t ν ν t r e θ t x j which only includes a production term p θ t the terms p γ e γ and p θ t and the constants σ f and σ θ t are given in langtry and menter 2009 the coupling between the k ω sst turbulence model and the γ r e θ t transition model is made by an effective intermittency γ eff which is used to control the production and dissipation terms in the k transport equation eq 2 the definition of the turbulent viscosity of the k ω sst turbulence model remains unchanged this model is also sometimes known as the γ r e θ t sst model because it makes use of the equations for γ and r e θ t in addition to the k and ω equations of the sst turbulence model menter et al 2003 therefore this model corresponds to a four equation transition sst turbulence model 2 3 flow solver the rans equations are solved using the refresco code developed within a cooperation led by marin for hydrodynamic applications refresco 2019 a finite volume technique with cell centered collocated variables is used for solving the equations a pressure correction equation based on the simple algorithm is used to ensure mass conservation a segregated approach is adopted here for the solution of all transport equations the implementation is face based which permits grids with elements consisting of an arbitrary number of faces for the convective flux terms a second order scheme quick is applied for the momentum equations and a first order upwind scheme is applied for the k ω sst turbulence model and γ r e θ t transition model in this study refresco version 2 3 is used 3 propeller geometry and numerical set up the marine propeller p4119 is considered in the present study the propeller has three blades a diameter of 0 305 m and an expanded area ratio of 0 5 the pitch diameter ratio and chord length at 0 7 of the propeller radius are 1 084 and 0 141 m respectively the propeller has no skew or rake for this propeller six nearly geometrically similar multi block structured grids are generated using the commercial grid generation software gridpro gridpro 2019 the grids for the entire propeller range from 900 thousand to 37 6 million cells in table 1 the number of cells in the volume and on a single blade and the maximum dimensionless wall distance of the first cell height y are listed for each grid a fine boundary layer resolution is obtained since the maximum y is lower than one for all grids therefore the boundary layer is fully resolved and no wall functions are used an overview of the grid with 37 6 million cells is presented in fig 2 a cylindrical domain is considered where the inlet the outlet and the outer boundary are located ten propeller radii from the domain origin a schematic overview of the computational domain and its boundaries is presented in fig 3 where r denotes the propeller radius the prescribed boundary conditions in the present work are the following at the inlet the uniform velocity and the turbulence level depending on the turbulence model are prescribed while the pressure is extrapolated from the interior assuming zero normal derivative neumann boundary condition at the outlet an outflow condition of zero normal derivative is prescribed for all flow variables at the outer boundary a constant pressure is set while a neumann boundary condition is used for all other variables for the propeller blades and hub no slip and impermeability conditions are applied at the surface and neumann boundary conditions are used for the pressure p intermittency γ and local transition onset momentum thickness reynolds number r e θ t in addition the turbulence kinetic energy k is set equal to zero and ω is specified at the near wall cell center menter 1994 in this study the turbulence level is specified at the inlet from the turbulence intensity t u 100 2 k 3 v a 2 and eddy viscosity ratio ν t ν where v a is the incoming flow velocity and equal to the propeller advance speed due to the strong dependence of the γ r e θ t transition model on the inlet turbulence quantities t u 1 2 and 1 5 and ν t ν 500 at the inlet boundary are specified the choice of these inlet turbulence quantities is based on a previous study baltazar et al 2018 where the γ r e θ t transition model has been used for the flow simulation on two marine propellers at model scale and the results have been compared with paint tests table 2 presents the turbulence intensity and eddy viscosity ratio at the inlet boundary x r 10 and plane x r 1 upstream of the propeller at the radial section r r 0 7 the results show that the large value selected for the eddy viscosity ratio ν t ν 500 is crucial in the control of the turbulence decay from the inlet boundary to the propeller plane spalart and rumsey 2007 and therefore in the prediction of transition occurrence and location for the k ω sst turbulence model standard values i e t u 1 0 and ν t ν 1 are assumed at the inlet boundary in this case and as shown in baltazar et al 2018 the influence of the inlet turbulence quantities on the propeller simulations is negligible 4 results 4 1 general results are presented for the marine propeller p4119 in open water conditions the propeller open water characteristics are expressed by the advance coefficient j thrust and torque coefficients k t k q and the open water efficiency η 0 as follows 6 j v a n d k t t ρ n 2 d 4 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 η 0 j 2 π k t k q where n ω 2 π is the rotation rate in rps d the propeller diameter t the propeller thrust and q the propeller torque other useful quantities are the pressure coefficient c p and the skin friction coefficient c f defined as 7 c p p p 1 2 ρ v ref 2 c f τ w 1 2 ρ v a 2 where p is the undisturbed static pressure here defined at the inlet boundary τ w is the local wall shear stress and v ref v a 2 ω r 2 is a reference velocity defined as the undisturbed onset velocity at the radial position r the use of the propeller advance speed on the definition of the skin friction coefficient allows a better identification of the transition location over the entire propeller blade whereas for the pressure coefficient the analysis is carried out at different radial sections and the standard definition based on the undisturbed onset velocity to those sections considered the rans simulations are compared with open water tests and ldv measurements of the blade boundary layer that were performed in the dtmb 24 in water tunnel the propeller was tested at 10 rps at an advance coefficient of j 0 833 corresponding to a reynolds number of 9 5 1 0 5 based on chord length c 0 7 r and inflow velocity v 0 7 r v a 2 0 7 r ω 2 at 0 7 of the propeller radius r 4 2 numerical errors in cfd computational fluid dynamics methods the three main contributions to the numerical error are round off error iterative error and discretization error oberkampf and roy 2010 since double precision is used in the present calculations the round off error is neglected therefore an analysis of the iterative and discretization errors involved in the present computations is shown in this section first the iterative error is analyzed for the rans simulations with the k ω sst turbulence model and γ r e θ t transition model for the γ r e θ t transition model the inflow turbulence quantities are set to 1 5 and 500 for the t u and ν t ν respectively the iterative error is estimated from the norms of the residuals of the momentum equations pressure correction and transport equations of the turbulence and transition models in this work we have adopted the l norm 8 l max res ϕ i 1 i n cells where n cells is the total number of grid cells and res ϕ refers to the residuals of the equations for any local flow quantity ϕ complementary the l 2 norm of the residuals is also studied 9 l 2 i 1 n cells res 2 ϕ i n cells the residuals are made non dimensional using the reference variables c 0 7 r v 0 7 r and p the l and l 2 norms of the residuals for the cartesian components of the flow velocity u x y z modified static pressure p turbulence kinetic energy k specific turbulence dissipation rate ω intermittency γ and local transition onset momentum thickness reynolds number r e θ t for the grid with 37 6 million cells g1 as a function of the number of iterations are plotted in fig 4 in this study a convergence criterion of 10 6 has been adopted for the l and l 2 norms of the flow quantities the analysis of the results obtained with the k ω sst turbulence model shows that convergence of the l and l 2 norms is obtained for all quantities however iterative convergence is not achieved for the γ r e θ t transition model in the transition region and depending on the local refinement level the intermittency may have abrupt changes and since is limited between zero and one this had led to maximum residuals of the order of 10 1 due to the jump between the laminar and turbulent regimes nonetheless this corresponds to a l 2 norm of the γ residual below 10 4 for the remaining quantities a l 2 error norm below 10 6 is achieved in the fully turbulent computations a large number of iterations is needed to obtain normalized residuals below than 10 6 this results in 80000 iterations since in the transition model computations the normalized residuals stagnate after 20000 iterations the computational effort is lower the extra computational cost of the turbulence model calculations is around 70 compared to the transition model solution in order to understand the influence of the iterative convergence on the propeller forces the variation of the thrust and torque coefficients with the number of iterations is presented in fig 5 for the propeller forces using the γ r e θ t transition model iterative convergence is achieved after 7000 iterations when the l and l 2 norms of the flow quantities have not yet stagnated in this sense a minor effect of the iterative error is expected on the prediction of the propeller coefficients the discretization error is estimated following the procedure described in eça and hoekstra 2014 in this procedure the discretization error is estimated based on the truncated power series expansion 10 ϕ i ϕ 0 α h i p where ϕ i is a quantity of interest obtained on grid i ϕ 0 is an estimate of the exact solution α is a constant h i is the typical cell size of grid i and p is the observed order of grid convergence since the grids are block structured and the same coarsening factor is applied on each direction the typical cell size of grid i is determined from the total number of grid cells n cells by h i 1 n cells 1 3 the unknown coefficients in eq 10 are determined from a least square fit of the numerical solutions for the six grids the error estimate is then converted into a numerical uncertainty u num which is meant to provide a 95 confidence interval the estimated uncertainty depends on the estimated discretization error ϕ i ϕ 0 the standard deviation of the fit and the difference between the real data point and the value obtained from the fit for the same grid density the complete procedure is described in eça and hoekstra 2014 the results of the numerical uncertainty estimation for the propeller forces are plotted in fig 6 the plots include also the fits and the apparent orders of convergence the numerical uncertainties are evidenced by the error bars for the two finest grids 21 and 37 6 million cells calculations were run for two days in parallel using 128 cpus at the marin cluster for the remaining grid sizes the calculations were performed overnight in parallel on a 16 cpu linux computer with the exception of the k t predicted by the γ r e θ t transition model numerical uncertainties lower than 1 are obtained in these cases near first order convergence is obtained for the thrust coefficient predicted with the k ω sst turbulence model and near second order convergence is obtained for the torque coefficient for the k t predicted by the γ r e θ t transition model the three coarsest grids deviate from the trend and are omitted from the least square fit in this case first order convergence is obtained and the uncertainty in the thrust coefficient is 1 since this study comprehends the analysis of local flow quantities the convergence with grid refinement of the pressure and skin friction coefficients at non dimensional chordwise locations s c 0 2 and 0 7 on the blade suction side are analyzed in fig 7 some cases do not show monotonic convergence in general apparent orders of convergence between 1 and 2 are obtained from the least square fits one exception is obtained for the c f at s c 0 7 using the γ r e θ t transition model where p 0 6 lower numerical uncertainties are obtained with the k ω sst turbulence model we note that large numerical uncertainties are estimated for the skin friction coefficient with the γ r e θ t transition model for sake of completeness the apparent orders of convergence and estimated numerical uncertainties are summarized in table 3 the discretization errors estimated from the least square fits ϕ 1 ϕ 0 are also presented in the table in general larger discretization errors are estimated for the γ r e θ t transition model since not only global quantities but also local flow quantities are analyzed and compared with the experimental results the influence of the grid density on the propeller forces and blade boundary layer velocity profiles are discussed the variation of the thrust and torque coefficients and open water efficiency for each grid compared to the finest grid is listed in table 4 differences lower than 1 are obtained for the grid with 9 9 million cells g3 fig 8 presents the chordwise component v s of the blade boundary layer velocity profile on the suction side at 0 5 of the chord length and 0 7 of the propeller radius results of all grid sizes are compared for both models the velocity profile is presented along the normal direction where y is the wall distance to blade surface and c the chord length a minor influence of the grid refinement level on the blade velocity profiles predicted by the k ω sst turbulence model is observed however convergence of the γ r e θ t transition model velocity profiles is difficult to obtain the maximum differences in the velocity profile between the grids with 9 9 million cells and 37 6 million cells are of the order of 4 the results show that fine grids are required to capture the flow details therefore the results obtained with the finest grid 37 6 million cells are considered for the analysis of the blade flow and comparison with experimental data 4 3 propeller blade flow in this section the propeller blade flow predictions using the turbulence and transition models are examined for the analysis of the different flow solutions the limiting streamlines and skin friction coefficient c f on the blade surface are presented in fig 9 the location where flow transition occurs is identified by the sudden rise of the skin friction distribution and the change in the orientation of the limiting streamlines towards the chordwise direction the results obtained with the γ r e θ t transition model present a laminar flow region with transition to turbulent flow at some distance from the leading edge a strong sensitivity to the inlet turbulence quantities in the prediction of laminar to turbulent transition is observed the domain of laminar flow reduces with the increase of the turbulence intensity at the inlet as expected the k ω sst turbulence model leads to turbulent flow on the propeller blades in this case a short laminar flow region is present along the leading edge this comparison shows that detailed experimental information is crucial for the selection of the inlet turbulence quantities when using the γ r e θ t transition model the predicted open water characteristics including the pressure and friction contributions to the force coefficients are compared with the experimental results in table 5 due to the growth in the turbulent flow region an increase in the magnitude of the friction contribution is observed at the same time a decrease in the pressure contribution is observed which may be explained by a decambering effect due to a thicker boundary layer a better agreement with the experimental torque coefficient is obtained with the k ω sst turbulence model for the thrust coefficient and open water efficiency a better agreement with the experimental data is obtained for the γ r e θ t transition model with t u 1 5 and ν t ν 500 at the inlet boundary in addition to the propeller forces the predicted blade pressure distribution is compared with experimental measurements since the pressure distributions presented in jessup 1989 were derived from the measured chordwise and radial velocity components at the boundary layer edge a similar approach is considered in this study for the rans simulations following jessup 1989 the pressure coefficient is calculated by 11 c p 1 v s v ref 2 v r v ref 2 with v ref v a 2 ω r 2 where v s and v r are the chordwise and radial velocity components in the propeller frame of reference calculated at the edge of the boundary layer δ respectively the estimated boundary layer thickness δ is obtained from the total pressure loss δ p t in the propeller frame of reference and is calculated as follows 12 δ p t p 1 2 ρ v x 2 v y 2 v z 2 p inlet 1 2 ρ v a 2 ω r 2 with p inlet p 2 3 ρ k inlet which results in a negative variation of the total pressure inside the boundary layer in the present work the boundary layer thickness is defined by the distance normal to the wall to a point where the total pressure loss coefficient c δ p t δ p t 1 2 ρ v ref 2 is equal to 0 01 corresponding approximately to the definition of 99 5 of the free stream velocity at that point the comparison between the calculated pressure distributions with the turbulence and transition models and the experimental data is presented at the radial sections r r 0 3 0 7 and 0 9 in fig 10 the non dimensional chordwise location is defined as s c similar results are obtained between the turbulence model and transition model a reasonable to good agreement between the numerical results and the experimental data is obtained at the radial sections r r 0 7 and 0 9 at the radial section r r 0 3 some discrepancies between the calculations and experiments are visible in the pressure distribution the larger disagreement observed at r r 0 3 in comparison with the other radial sections may be due to the boundary layer thickness corrections applied by jessup 1989 to the chordwise location of the measurements this correction is especially important towards the blade root due to the thicker blade sections the values larger than 1 0 obtained at the trailing edge indicate lack of accuracy in the determination of the measured chordwise positions in addition some differences are observed near the blade leading edge for all radial sections jessup 1989 suggested that these differences may be due to errors in the geometry model 4 4 comparison of velocity profiles in this section a comparison of the velocity profiles in the blade boundary layer between the rans simulations and the experiments is made the chordwise v s and radial v r components of the flow velocity were measured by a ldv system comprising a one component lens system with a fiber optic probe the measurement volume formed by the interception of the two transmission beams is placed tangential to the blade surface at each measurement point as the propeller rotates velocity measurements along the boundary layer are acquired the chordwise and radial velocity components are measured by setting the plane that contains the transmission beams tangentially or perpendicularly to the blade surface respectively in order to fully capture the large flow gradients near the blades a measurement volume characterized by a reference length of approximately 0 075 mm was used seeding particles were added to the flow to improve signal to noise ratio in the propeller model two blades had leading edges roughened with 60 μ m distributed roughness and the other blade was smooth jessup 1989 figs 11 to 13 show the chordwise and radial boundary layer velocity profiles at 0 7 of the propeller radius developed on the suction and pressure sides at different chordwise locations respectively in addition figs 14 and 15 show the chordwise and radial boundary layer velocity profiles developed at the 0 9 radius respectively these profiles are shown in the propeller fixed frame of reference the numerical predictions are compared with the experimental boundary layer profiles measured on the smooth and tripped blades the legends present the estimated boundary layer thicknesses of the numerical results the grid resolution inside the blade boundary layer consists of more than 30 layers with an expansion ratio of 1 2 along the direction normal to the blade surface from the streamwise measurements at 0 7 of the propeller radius the smooth blade appears to have transitioned on the suction side by 0 7 of the chord in this case the best agreement with the smooth blade measurements is obtained for the γ r e θ t transition model with t u 1 2 before transition after transition a better match is obtained for the γ r e θ t transition model with t u 1 5 on the pressure side the best agreement is achieved for the γ r e θ t transition model with t u 1 5 since the results with t u 1 2 predict a too large laminar flow region the suction side radial profiles at 0 7 radius on the smooth blade predicted by the γ r e θ t transition model with t u 1 2 are also laminar showing a very large outward radial flow near the wall at s c 0 77 the measured outward radial flow reduces significantly and a better agreement is obtained with γ r e θ t transition model using t u 1 5 from the measurements on the smooth blade at 0 9 of the propeller radius transition seems to occur between 0 3 and 0 4 of the section chord the streamwise velocity profiles obtained from the γ r e θ t transition model with both t u 1 2 and 1 5 show that transition is predicted at more aft chord locations the measured radial profiles on the smooth blade show small outward flow near the wall similar profile shapes are obtained with the γ r e θ t transition model using t u 1 5 the velocity profiles predicted by the k ω sst turbulence model approach the measurements on the tripped blade however inflected profiles are obtained at the chordwise positions close to the leading edge from the tripped blade measurements at 0 7 of the propeller radius according to jessup 1989 these discrepancies are attributed to the influence of the leading edge roughness on the blade flow for the radial section 0 9 the tripped blade shows a turbulent profile at 0 3 chord without the inflection these variations may be due to the amount of distributed roughness along the radial direction jessup 1989 4 5 boundary layer characteristics from the predicted velocity profiles the boundary layer thickness δ displacement thickness δ and shape factor h are calculated and represented in figs 16 and 17 in this work the boundary layer parameters are predicted from the streamwise velocity profiles and the integrals estimated by numerical integration from the wall to the boundary layer thickness the predicted displacement thickness and shape factor are also compared with the calculations of jessup 1989 from the measured velocity profiles the evolution of the boundary layer thickness along the chordwise direction shows the increase in thickness due to transition from laminar to turbulent flow regime for the displacement thickness and shape factor agreement between the numerical simulations and the experimentally determined boundary layer parameters is difficult to obtain in general the results obtained for the k ω sst turbulence model approach the experimental values of the tripped blade the same trend is observed between the γ r e θ t transition model and the smooth blade experiments in general a better agreement is obtained with t u 1 5 however as previously discussed in the analysis of the velocity profiles the agreement at 0 7 of the propeller radius on the suction side improves with t u 1 2 the experimental and numerical shape factors show large values in the laminar flow region which reduce to turbulent profile values around 1 4 typical of two dimensional flows the drops observed in the shape factor with the development of the boundary layer correlate well with the estimated transition locations based on the velocity profiles 5 conclusions in this paper a comparison between rans calculations and experimental data has been presented the analysis is carried out for marine propeller p4119 for which three dimensional velocity component measurements on the blade boundary layer are available at model scale in the model propeller two blades had rough leading edges and the other blade was smooth for the rans calculations two models are considered the commonly used k ω sst eddy viscosity turbulence model and the γ r e θ t transition model the influence of the iterative errors discretization errors and boundary conditions on the propeller flow predictions has been analyzed the γ r e θ t transition model does not satisfy the iterative convergence criterion still its influence on the propeller forces is assumed to be small due to the fast convergence of the thrust and torque coefficients the numerical uncertainty of the propeller forces integral quantities and pressure and skin friction coefficients local quantities has been determined from an estimation of the discretization error based on systematically refined grids low numerical uncertainties less than 2 are obtained for the propeller force coefficients for the local quantities small numerical uncertainties less than 4 are predicted with the k ω sst turbulence model for the γ r e θ t transition model larger uncertainties are obtained more than 9 especially for the skin friction coefficient the numerical predictions of the velocity profiles have been compared with blade boundary layer measurements an agreement is found between the turbulent velocity profile predicted by the k ω sst turbulence model and the measured velocities from the tripped blade for the γ r e θ t transition model the agreement with the smooth blade velocity measurements is highly dependent on the inlet turbulence quantities in this work from the selected inlet turbulence quantities a qualitative agreement is obtained for the blade boundary layer velocity profiles however this information may not be available which limits the predictive capabilities of the γ r e θ t transition model at model scale specially because the selected inlet values are not realistic from the physical point of view finally boundary layer integral quantities obtained from the measured and computed velocity profiles have been analyzed the evolution of these quantities along the chordwise direction shows typical laminar and turbulent flow behaviors the comparison between the rans calculations and the experimental measurements shows that the considered models can be used not only for the prediction of integral quantities but also for the analysis of the local features of the propeller blade flow nevertheless the selection of the inlet turbulence quantities is crucial in the prediction of the transition location and in the accuracy of the model scale propeller performance prediction therefore the assessment of the predictive capabilities of the γ r e θ t transition model requires the analyses of not only the propeller forces but also of the blade boundary layer flow for the identification of transition location credit authorship contribution statement joão baltazar

21713,the water entry of cylindrical projectiles at high oblique speed has been investigated experimentally and numerically projectiles with three types of noses and different lengths are tested the projectiles are lunched at different angles and the development of supercavities are recorded using high speed camera during the water entry deflections occur due to the deviation of the initial velocity and or the hydrodynamic impact force the evolution of the supercavities of projectile without deviation is observed it is found that the collapse of cavity and the generation of new cavity occur alternatively the motion and the evolution of supercavities at the initial stage of the water entry are simulated through computational fluid dynamics the typical pressure distributions have been analysed the drag coefficients are dominated by the nose shape keywords oblique water entry projectile supercavity drag coefficient 1 introduction the water entry problem had been studied over a century supercavities have been found in the drop of life boats and the air to sea projectiles the generation of supercavity and its evolution was not well understood until world war ii truscott et al 2014 the motion of the projectile during water entry would be dominated by the shape of the nose the entry angle and the initial entry speed the concerned structures include spheres disks and slender bodies with various noses when the projectile hits the water surface at high speed the flow separates from the nose and supercavity forms the pressure in the cavity will decrease significantly as the cavity forms abelson 1970 the air suction and cavitation would occur simultaneously after the closure of the super cavity the phase change of the flow in the high speed water entry could be involved as the projectile entering water obliquely the trajectory of the projectile and the natural cavity would be unstable truscott et al 2009 the formed cavity and its evolution during the high speed oblique water entry require systematic investigations experimental studies of the cavity were carried out with the development of high speed photography technology truscott et al 2009 observed that the projectiles entering water at shallow angles would ricochet or tumble when caliber bullets were used the trajectory of modified 0 22 inch caliber bullet became steady when larger length to diameter ratios and blunt nose projectiles were used they found that the trajectories of projectile with flat head could avoid the tumble at very shallow angles weiland and vlachos 2012 investigated the development of cavitation induced by cylindrical projectiles up to 24 m s the development of partial cavity depended on the interaction between small cavitation bubbles and vortex ring generated by the projectile the dynamics of the supercavities was different when the entry speeds changed it seems that the dynamic behavior at even higher speed would be different except the gravity force and inertial force surface treatment affects the motion of projectile and the shape of cavity aristoff and bush 2009 observed the vertical water entry of hydrophobic sphere at low speed the collapse of cavity is dominated by the surface tension other than the gravity bodily et al 2014 studied the trajectory of projectiles impacting on water vertically and obliquely with relative low velocity the diameter of cavity induced by projectile with hydrophobic coating is larger than that with hydrophilic coating however the lateral displacement of projectiles caused by the surface treatment is less than that resulted by the oblique velocity however the effects of surface tension by hydrophobic coating or hydrophilic coating can be ignored for high speed water entry problem beside the surface treatment study of the water entry in concentrated solution of drag reducing additives jiang et al 2016 showed decrease of drag and increasing of cavity size at velocities 45 m s to 60 m s chen et al 2019 studied the effects of the nose shape on the stability of trajectories of the projectile experimentally they also found that flat nose resulted in stable trajectory while the ogival nose inclined to induce deviation the discussions on the reasons of the deviation are not supported by data and the physics of the deflection require further investigations generally speaking the entry speed and entry angle have profound effects on the behavior of the cavity the profile of supercavity can be predicted theoretically the cavity profile and its motion can be described using cavity closure model with a re entrant jet through the dynamics of the cavity based on energy conservation efros 1946 logvinovich 1973 proposed the principle of independent expansion of cavity it is found that the time of deep closure is essentially constant and independent of the impact velocity lee et al 1997 apart from the evolution of the cavity lee 2000 applied a quasi steady flow model to predict the pressure inside the cavity good agreement of the theoretical result and experiment was found for longer time simulation paryshev 2006 developed a closure model with a central re entrant jet for the collapse of supercavity the re entrant jet model which is based on the work of logvinovich 1973 and efros 1946 gave a good approximation of the cavity all these theoretical method concerned the profile of the cavity the details of the flow field around the projectile and the free surface effects at the initial stage of water entry are not addressed properly the pressure over the nose of the projectiles are not considered the early works of water entry consider the impact of wedges on the initial calm water surface at moderate speed i e xu et al 2010 for work concerns the initial stages of water entry the closure of the cavity seems been ignored when the flow separates from the knuckles the highest pressure is found at the apex of wedge and pressure at the knuckle equals with the ambient air pressure after flow separation wang et al 2015a bao et al 2016 furthermore the pressure oscillation inside the cavity has been observed after the pinch off of the cavity wang et al 2015b bodily et al 2014 the dynamic behavior of the pressure during the high speed water entry requires high fidelity experimental and numerical studies the water entry of projectile is a typical multiphase flow problem the unsteady motion of the projectile and the developed cavity can be simulated through numerical schemes hou et al 2018 studied the oblique water entry of projectile at low froude number experimentally and numerically multi scale vortex structures have been found in the simulation erfanian et al 2015 adopted the coupled euler lagrangian method to calculate the interaction of the fluids and slender body chen et al 2018 investigated the effects of compressibility on high speed water entry through commercial software it is found that the drag coefficient depended on the mach number in the transonic regime for high speed oblique water entry of projectiles the interactions of the projectile free surface and cavity make the problem complicated the contribution of each factors is not clear the oblique water entries of projectiles ranging from 80 m s to 130 m s are investigated experimentally and numerically in present study the motion of the projectiles and the evolution of the cavities are concerned the effects of nose shapes mass entry speed and entry angle are studied firstly the projectile geometry and experimental setup are introduced in section 2 in section 3 the experimental results are analysed the development and the evolution of the supercavities are observed in the case of water entry without deflection the collapse of first cavity and generation of new cavity inside the first cavity has been found in section 4 numerical simulations based on incompressible navier stokes equation are carried out to investigate the initial stage of the water entry the overset mesh techniques are adopted and the coupled motions are analysed through time stepping scheme the typical pressure distributions at various entry distances are analysed 2 experimental setup the oblique water entry of cylindrical projectiles is performed in a water tank the length of the tank is 1 5 m and its width and depth is 0 5 m 0 8 m the projectiles are lunched using a crossbow which is fixed on an alloy frame the entry angle of the projectiles can be adjusted between 30 and 90 the settings of the experiment are illustrated in fig 1 the experimental devices include high speed camera water tank lamps frosted glass crossbow and fixtures high speed camera the side wall of water tank frosted glass and lamps are arranged in a straight line the high speed camera is phantom v12 1 the frame rates range from 5000 to 10000 fps frames per second the projectiles are manufactured using high carbon steel the projectiles with three types of nose are shown in fig 2 the diameter d 8 m m for cone shaped nose the cone angle is defined as θ the cone angles of these cone shaped noses are θ 63 and θ 91 respectively for ogival nose the shape is described using c r h caliber radius head which is defined as c r h l d where l is the length of the nose the measured ogival nose c r h 1 15 the experiments of the water entry of the projectiles are carried out in 9 groups which are numbered as case a to case i table 1 shows the parameters of these projectiles in each group the entry angles β are set at 35 48 70 and 90 respectively the entry velocities of projectiles with overall length l 30 m m 40 m m and 50 m m are different due to their masses each case is repeated up to three times in case of failures due to disturbances 3 experimental results 3 1 the overall results of the stability of trajectories the projectiles are lunched along a sliding rail using a crossbow they penetrate the water surface at set angles the time t 0 is defined when the projectile contacts the water surface and the subsequent time is defined based on this physical time the projectiles could deviate from their original trajectories due to the disturbance of the launching device and or the hydrodynamic impact forces the projectiles would tumble and their trajectories will become unstable we outline the overall status of the projections in table 2 as the projectiles penetrate water surface the deflections are either counterclockwise or clockwise in general the number of counter clockwise deflections is more than that of clockwise deflections the overall success rate of water entry without deflections is over 40 the success rate is 50 with ogival nose the success of water entry is affected by the initial velocities and the shapes of the noses of the projectiles when the projectiles are accelerated along the rail of the crossbow the initial velocity would be off the axis of the projectiles and the hydrodynamic force will further result in the deflection of the trajectories for water entry of projectiles with deflections three typical deflections of case h at different entry angles are presented the length of projectile l 49 82 m m the cone angle of the nose θ 91 89 and the mass m 18 3 g in fig 3 the projectile enters water at β 35 a free surface elevation on the upper side of the contact point and a splash can be observed the cavity forms as the flow detaches from the nose of the projectile the projectile rotates counterclockwise and its tail contacts the cavity surface at t 3 m s the cavity surface has been destroyed in a few milliseconds afterward however the surface closure of the cavity seems not affected fig 4 shows the clockwise deflection of the projectile at entry angle β 48 as the projectile entering water the clockwise deflection can be seen and the tail of the projectile contacts the surface of cavity at t 5 m s fig 5 further shows the counterclockwise deflection of the projectile at entry angle β 70 the tail of the projectile contacts the cavity wall at t 7 m s comparing with the deflections in figs 3 and 4 the physical time of contacting with cavity surface has been delayed when the projectile impacts on water surface obliquely the nose is the only wetted area the hydrodynamic pressure over the nose is not axi symmetric wu and sun 2014 the uneven pressure distribution produces a biased hydrodynamic force and moment which results in the rotational motion and the deviation of the trajectory when the projectile is disturbed by the hydrodynamic impact force it cannot return to its original trajectory since there is no restoring force and righting moment if the velocity of the projectile is off the radical axis the hydrodynamic force at the beginning of the penetration will further increase this deflection and the trajectory becomes unstable fig 6 shows the vertical water entry of a projectile there is no deflection and the projectile moves out of the screen the typical features including the splash cavity re entrain jet and the surface closure can be seen during the water entry of projectile as the cavity collapses a new cavity inflates inside the supercavity at t 7 m s this second cavity is a new phenomenon in the high speed water entry as the screen frame is limited the projectile run out of sight and some details of these phenomena have been omitted 3 2 the motions of the projectiles and the profiles of cavities the water is displaced by the projectiles as they contact the water surface the cavity forms when the flow passes the nose and separates at the edge of the nose it is expected that the nose shape dominates the flow pattern the motions of the projectiles and the profile of the cavities we compare the motions of projectiles with cone shaped noses and ogival nose the cone angle θ 63 06 θ 91 89 and the c r h 1 15 respectively parameters including length and mass can be referred to case g case h and case i in table 1 the entry angles are β 48 fig 7 presents the horizontal and vertical components of the velocities and displacements the velocity is obtained from the time difference against the displacement it is the average velocity within each sequential time step as shown in fig 7 a and b the initial velocities of these projectiles are nearly the same the velocities of projectile with cone shaped nose θ 91 89 decrease more quickly while the velocities of projectile with ogival nose c r h 1 15 decrease slower this suggests that the cone shaped nose results larger resistance and the ogival nose leads to smaller resistance consequently the entry distance of projectile with ogival nose increases more quickly as seen in fig 7 c and d the slopes of the velocities and displacements indicate the difference of the drag coefficients of these projectiles the cavities induced by these projectiles of different nose shapes are shown in fig 8 the entry distance from the contact point s 149 m m the maximum radical diameter of the cavity below the initial calm water surface is defined as b the measured maximum diameters for case g h and i are b 38 6 m m b 41 8 m m and b 34 7 m m respectively the cone shaped nose with θ 91 89 induces the largest cavity and the ogival nose induces smallest cavity it means that the displaced water volume of case h is more since the cavity size is larger we also observe that the free surface elevation and the height of the splash are positively related to the size of the cavity more energy is imparted into the water in the perspective of energy conservation in other words the losses of kinematic energy of the projectiles are positive related to the size of the cavity from the figure the counterclockwise deflections in fig 8 a and c can be seen the cavity surface will be destroyed in a few minisecond the motions of projectiles of same cone shaped nose but different length and initial velocity are investigated parameters are listed as case a case d and case g in table 1 the entry angle β 35 fig 9 shows the axial velocities horizontal and vertical components of the velocities and displacements as shown in fig 9 a b and c the velocities and their components of shorter projectile decrease more quickly while the velocities of longer projectile decreases slower however the lines of velocities of short projectile are above those of longer projectile as a result the lines of entry distances of shorter projectile are over those of longer projectiles as seen in fig 9 d and e considering the different initial velocity and mass the drag coefficients of these projectiles require further analysis the cavities induced by these projectiles of different lengths and masses are shown in fig 10 the entry distance from the contact point s 144 m m the measured maximum radical diameters of the cavity of case a d and g are b 44 5 m m the shapes of the cavities are the same although the entry velocities and physical time are different it is observed that the free surface elevation and the height of the splash are quite similar minor counterclockwise deflections in fig 10 a b and c can be seen this could be caused by the biased hydrodynamic force when the projectile contacts the water surface the shadow inside of the cavity which would be the mixture of air and steam is not exactly the same this might be resulted by different pressure due to various velocities of the projectiles generally the cavity shape is dominated by the shape of the nose of the projectile 3 3 the evolution of the cavity of the projectile travelling a longer distance we note that oblique water entry of the projectile would show detailed evolution of the cavity since a longer travelling distance can be recorded the oblique water entry of the projectile of case a at entry angle β 48 is carried out the evolution of the cavities without deflection has been recorded fig 11 shows that a new cavity inside the first cavity appears at t 2 m s this second cavity develops from a thin water layer detached from the tail of the projectile the new cavity inflates radically and axially and it merges with the outer cavity surface as the entry distance increases further we can see the shade around the projectile it would be the mixture of air and steam truscott et al 2014 where the light can t penetrate this area at the same time the shadow area appear around the rear of the cavity near free surface where the collapse of cavity occurs fig 12 shows the collapse of the first cavity and further expansion of the second cavity the gap between the first cavity and the second cavity disappears the surfaces of these two cavities merge except the cap of the second cavity the second cavity becomes the major cavity as the first cavity collapses the second cavity resembles a spindle apparatus with a wake tail inside the cavity a re entrain jet flow which could be the mixture of air and steam is moving towards the projectile at t 6 29 m s the third cavity appears at the tail of the projectile it can be seen in fig 13 that the re entrain of air steam mixture at the rear of the cavity when it collapses the second cavity is filled with the mixture at t 9 14 m s the radical impact flow at the rear of the cavity results the re entrain flow as the second cavity collapses the third cavity develops at the tail of the projectile the third cavity starts to expand as shown in fig 14 the collapse of the cavity leaves a wake flow because of the limitation of the screen the projectile and part of the cavity is out of sight the new cavity develops inside the old cavity and the new cavity becomes the major cavity as the old cavity collapses there could be a few cycles of collapse of old cavity and generation of new cavity during the evolution of the cavities the formation of new cavity is complex the pressure would be low at the separation point at the edge of the nose there could be phase transition of water and vapor part of the mixture could become a water layer attached on the surface of projectile and this water layer forms the second and third cavities besides there could be oscillation of pressure inside the cavities bodily et al 2014 wang et al 2015b which would result in the oscillation of acceleration of the projectile 4 numerical simulation of the initial stage of the water entry the oblique water entries of projectiles can be simulated through computational fluid dynamics details of the flow field can be analysed the commercial software star ccm version 12 02 is adopted to simulate the interactions of projectiles and the water considering the coupled motion of projectiles the overset mesh techniques and dfbi dynamic fluid body interaction method are used there is a background mesh block with an air water interface and an overset mesh block which is moving along with the projectile data exchange between background mesh and overset mesh is realized by the least square interpolation the turbulence model is realizable k ε the vof model is adopted to capture the air water interface with liquid volume fraction 0 5 the implicit unsteady algorithm is used for velocity pressure coupling and the second order scheme is used for temporal discretization the same numerical scheme had been used to investigated the oblique water entry of wedge yang and xu 2018 the computational domain of the water entry of the projectiles is the same as that of the experiment for high speed water entry the local pressure may be lower than the vapor pressure of water the cavitation source term based on the schnerr sauer model has been included where the compressibility and surface tension have been ignored the study of the independence of time resolution and mesh resolution is carried out firstly the water entry of a projectile with cone shaped nose is simulated the parameters of the projectile is the same as case h in table 1 and the entry angle β 48 table 3 presents the mesh resolution and the time step intervals in the convergence study the computational domain and the typical meshes are shown in fig 15 the horizontal and vertical components of the acceleration and velocity of the projectile are shown in fig 16 the numerical results with different meshes and time step intervals agree well with each other the acceleration components increase from zero to its maximum as the nose of the projectile contacts the water surface it decreases as the projectile entering water the velocity components of the projectile decrease significantly in a few milliseconds in general the calculated horizontal and vertical components of velocity agree with those of experiment where the velocity of projectile is obtained from the difference of its displacement against time we further compare the snapshot of cavity at various instant in fig 17 a the profiles of the cavities agree with those of experiment the re entrain of the water jet can be seen when the closure of the cavity happens the cavity collapses and leaves a wake tail when the projectile travels a longer distance it resembles a spindle apparatus similar to that in fig 12 as shown in fig 17 b the pressure contour and the velocity of the flow field are further presented in fig 18 the highest pressure is observed at the tip of the sharp nose it decreases outwards and the pressure contour looks like a mushroom the low pressure area is found in the cavity high speed re entrain flow moving toward the tail of the projectile can be found in the cavity as shown in fig 18 b this shall be caused by the air suction and the impact of radical flow during the closure of free surface the direction of jet flow inside the cavity is described using arrows and the color represents the magnitude of the velocity the flow velocity decreases significantly with a short radical distance off the projectile the physics of the evolution of the cavity is complex it contains the mixture of water air and steam in addition there could be physical transitions of water to steam or steam to water during the water entry we note the second cavities observed in the experiment however present commercial code is incapable to simulate the development of second cavity and longtime evolution the phase transition of the steam to water is not included in the numerical modeling further numerical simulations are confined to the initial stage of the water entry in following simulations the mesh size of d x 2 0 0015 m and δ t 6 0 10 6 are adopted to assure the accuracy and the economy of computer resource the water entries of projectiles with different lengths and masses are further simulated the mass of the projectile is positively related to the length the initial entry velocities of the projectiles are v 0 127 5 m s v 0 91 2 m s and v 0 80 0 m s the corresponding masses are m 10 0 g m 14 5 g m 18 0 g respectively the time histories of velocities of these projectiles are shown in fig 19 as the projectiles penetrate the water surface the huge impact force results the deceleration of the projectile it can be seen in fig 19 a and b that the velocity components decrease more significantly when the entry speed is higher these curves agree well with the experimental data in fig 9 although the parameters of the simulation are not exactly the same as those of experiment fig 20 shows the drag coefficient c d the drag coefficient is defined as c d f 0 5 ρ v 2 a with a 0 25 π d 2 it increases dramatically and experience minor oscillations at beginning of the water entry it becomes stable after the supercavity forms it is interesting to see that the stable drag coefficients of these projectiles are generally in good agreement although the entry speeds and the masses of the projectiles are different the minor discrepancy would be caused by the difference of the pressure inside the cavity the numerical results indicate that the drag coefficients are dominated by the wetted nose of the projectile and the contributions of mass and the entry speed are less significant the water entries of projectile case h at different entry angles are simulated although the shapes of the noses are the same the wetted areas are different when it contacts the water surface for nose with cone angle θ 91 5 the edge of the nose touches the water surface first when β 35 after the cavity forms the nose of the projectile is fully wetted the time histories of velocities of the projectile at various entry angles are shown in fig 21 the axial velocities decline at the same rate except at the very beginning of the entry as shown in fig 21 a the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity are shown in fig 21 b and c these components are generally the cosine and sinusoidal components of the axial velocity the typical profiles of the cavities at t 1 8 m s are shown in fig 22 the profiles of these cavities agree with those snapshots from experiments the corresponding hydrodynamic forces are shown in fig 23 a the axial hydrodynamic force f increases sharply and the peak is found as soon as the projectile contacts the water the peak impact force is lower when the entry angle is shallower the drag coefficients c d are further presented in fig 23 b the peak drag coefficient is found at the beginning of the water entry it declines as the supercavity forms the variation of added mass dominates the total hydrodynamic force at the initial stage of water entry wang et al 2019 when the entry of angle is shallow the increase of added mass is less than those of larger entry angles after the flow separation and the development of the supercavity the drag coefficients become stable and are the same this indicates that the stable drag coefficient depends on the shape of the wetted nose of the projectile after it entering water surface the effects of entry angle are less significant except the initial stage of the entry the non dimensional pressure distributions p p 0 0 5 ρ v 2 on the line cutting by a vertical plane through its radical axis are shown in fig 24 where p 0 and ρ are the ambient air pressure and density of water respectively as the nose touches the water surface the pressure on the lower side is higher than that of the upper side it is observed that the pressure is nearly zero on the upper side of the nose when β 35 at t 0 05 m s while the pressure is symmetric with β 90 the pressure on the nose is symmetric and in good agreements when the nose is fully wetted e g t 0 5 m s and t 3 m s the water entries of projectiles with different noses are simulated further the mass m 18 3 g the entry speed v 0 80 m s and the entry angle β 48 the time histories of the velocities are shown in fig 25 the projectiles with three cone shaped noses and one ogival nose are simulated as the projectiles entering water the velocities decrease in the manner of linear function the slope of the curve of velocity with cone angle θ 150 is the steepest while that of projectile with ogival nose is mild this indicates that the drag coefficient is higher with larger cone angle fig 26 presents the drag forces and the drag coefficients against time these drag forces decrease as the velocities decrease however the drag coefficients become steady after the development of supercavities although peak values appear at the beginning of the water entry when cone angle θ 150 and θ 91 5 the drag coefficient is higher with nose of larger cone angle and the drag coefficient is the lowest with ogival nose the pressure distributions over the wetted nose are shown in fig 27 when the nose contacts the water surface at t 0 05 m s the pressure on the lower side is higher the pressure on the upper side is much lower the unsymmetrical pressure about its axis would cause the biased force and rotational moment resulting the deflection of the trajectory as the projectiles penetrate the water and cavities form the pressure becomes axi symmetrical the highest pressure is found at the tip of the nose the pressure distribution is sharp with fine nose while the pressure distribution is full when the nose is blunt as shown in fig 27 b and c the pressure distribution illustrates the difference of drag coefficients 5 concluding remarks the water entry of projectile at high oblique velocity has been investigated experimentally and numerically the entry velocities range from v 0 80 0 m s to v 0 127 5 m s deflections of the trajectories have been found in the experiment and the cavity surface is destroyed as the projectile contacts the cavity surface for water entry without deflection the drag coefficients and the profiles of the cavities depend on the shape of the nose the evolutions of cavities with second and third cavities during the oblique water entry are observed as the first cavity collapses the second cavity develops and inflates as the projectile entering water the second cavity merges with the first cavity then the third cavity occurs when the second cavity collapses the collapses of old cavity and expansion of new cavity occur alternatively in the development of these cavities the pressure in the cavity is low and there could be phase transition of steam and water further investigations are required with the help of higher speed camera with higher resolutions numerical simulations of the oblique water entry of projectiles at initial stage are carried out the pressure distribution is not axi symmetrical about its radical axis at the beginning of oblique water entry this would cause the deflection of the trajectory when the entry angle is shallow the drag coefficient on the projectile is dominated by the shape of the nose the contributions of mass entry speed and entry angle are secondary the drag coefficient of the projectile is lower when the nose is sharp the drag coefficient is higher when the nose is blunt the development of the second and the third cavities are first observed however the physical transition of water and steam is beyond the scope of present commercial software further development of new modeling of the numerical method is required for high fidelity simulations of the full process of the water entry besides the surface tension of cavity during the closure of cavity shall be included ni et al 2016 credit authorship contribution statement z j song software data curation writing original

21713,the water entry of cylindrical projectiles at high oblique speed has been investigated experimentally and numerically projectiles with three types of noses and different lengths are tested the projectiles are lunched at different angles and the development of supercavities are recorded using high speed camera during the water entry deflections occur due to the deviation of the initial velocity and or the hydrodynamic impact force the evolution of the supercavities of projectile without deviation is observed it is found that the collapse of cavity and the generation of new cavity occur alternatively the motion and the evolution of supercavities at the initial stage of the water entry are simulated through computational fluid dynamics the typical pressure distributions have been analysed the drag coefficients are dominated by the nose shape keywords oblique water entry projectile supercavity drag coefficient 1 introduction the water entry problem had been studied over a century supercavities have been found in the drop of life boats and the air to sea projectiles the generation of supercavity and its evolution was not well understood until world war ii truscott et al 2014 the motion of the projectile during water entry would be dominated by the shape of the nose the entry angle and the initial entry speed the concerned structures include spheres disks and slender bodies with various noses when the projectile hits the water surface at high speed the flow separates from the nose and supercavity forms the pressure in the cavity will decrease significantly as the cavity forms abelson 1970 the air suction and cavitation would occur simultaneously after the closure of the super cavity the phase change of the flow in the high speed water entry could be involved as the projectile entering water obliquely the trajectory of the projectile and the natural cavity would be unstable truscott et al 2009 the formed cavity and its evolution during the high speed oblique water entry require systematic investigations experimental studies of the cavity were carried out with the development of high speed photography technology truscott et al 2009 observed that the projectiles entering water at shallow angles would ricochet or tumble when caliber bullets were used the trajectory of modified 0 22 inch caliber bullet became steady when larger length to diameter ratios and blunt nose projectiles were used they found that the trajectories of projectile with flat head could avoid the tumble at very shallow angles weiland and vlachos 2012 investigated the development of cavitation induced by cylindrical projectiles up to 24 m s the development of partial cavity depended on the interaction between small cavitation bubbles and vortex ring generated by the projectile the dynamics of the supercavities was different when the entry speeds changed it seems that the dynamic behavior at even higher speed would be different except the gravity force and inertial force surface treatment affects the motion of projectile and the shape of cavity aristoff and bush 2009 observed the vertical water entry of hydrophobic sphere at low speed the collapse of cavity is dominated by the surface tension other than the gravity bodily et al 2014 studied the trajectory of projectiles impacting on water vertically and obliquely with relative low velocity the diameter of cavity induced by projectile with hydrophobic coating is larger than that with hydrophilic coating however the lateral displacement of projectiles caused by the surface treatment is less than that resulted by the oblique velocity however the effects of surface tension by hydrophobic coating or hydrophilic coating can be ignored for high speed water entry problem beside the surface treatment study of the water entry in concentrated solution of drag reducing additives jiang et al 2016 showed decrease of drag and increasing of cavity size at velocities 45 m s to 60 m s chen et al 2019 studied the effects of the nose shape on the stability of trajectories of the projectile experimentally they also found that flat nose resulted in stable trajectory while the ogival nose inclined to induce deviation the discussions on the reasons of the deviation are not supported by data and the physics of the deflection require further investigations generally speaking the entry speed and entry angle have profound effects on the behavior of the cavity the profile of supercavity can be predicted theoretically the cavity profile and its motion can be described using cavity closure model with a re entrant jet through the dynamics of the cavity based on energy conservation efros 1946 logvinovich 1973 proposed the principle of independent expansion of cavity it is found that the time of deep closure is essentially constant and independent of the impact velocity lee et al 1997 apart from the evolution of the cavity lee 2000 applied a quasi steady flow model to predict the pressure inside the cavity good agreement of the theoretical result and experiment was found for longer time simulation paryshev 2006 developed a closure model with a central re entrant jet for the collapse of supercavity the re entrant jet model which is based on the work of logvinovich 1973 and efros 1946 gave a good approximation of the cavity all these theoretical method concerned the profile of the cavity the details of the flow field around the projectile and the free surface effects at the initial stage of water entry are not addressed properly the pressure over the nose of the projectiles are not considered the early works of water entry consider the impact of wedges on the initial calm water surface at moderate speed i e xu et al 2010 for work concerns the initial stages of water entry the closure of the cavity seems been ignored when the flow separates from the knuckles the highest pressure is found at the apex of wedge and pressure at the knuckle equals with the ambient air pressure after flow separation wang et al 2015a bao et al 2016 furthermore the pressure oscillation inside the cavity has been observed after the pinch off of the cavity wang et al 2015b bodily et al 2014 the dynamic behavior of the pressure during the high speed water entry requires high fidelity experimental and numerical studies the water entry of projectile is a typical multiphase flow problem the unsteady motion of the projectile and the developed cavity can be simulated through numerical schemes hou et al 2018 studied the oblique water entry of projectile at low froude number experimentally and numerically multi scale vortex structures have been found in the simulation erfanian et al 2015 adopted the coupled euler lagrangian method to calculate the interaction of the fluids and slender body chen et al 2018 investigated the effects of compressibility on high speed water entry through commercial software it is found that the drag coefficient depended on the mach number in the transonic regime for high speed oblique water entry of projectiles the interactions of the projectile free surface and cavity make the problem complicated the contribution of each factors is not clear the oblique water entries of projectiles ranging from 80 m s to 130 m s are investigated experimentally and numerically in present study the motion of the projectiles and the evolution of the cavities are concerned the effects of nose shapes mass entry speed and entry angle are studied firstly the projectile geometry and experimental setup are introduced in section 2 in section 3 the experimental results are analysed the development and the evolution of the supercavities are observed in the case of water entry without deflection the collapse of first cavity and generation of new cavity inside the first cavity has been found in section 4 numerical simulations based on incompressible navier stokes equation are carried out to investigate the initial stage of the water entry the overset mesh techniques are adopted and the coupled motions are analysed through time stepping scheme the typical pressure distributions at various entry distances are analysed 2 experimental setup the oblique water entry of cylindrical projectiles is performed in a water tank the length of the tank is 1 5 m and its width and depth is 0 5 m 0 8 m the projectiles are lunched using a crossbow which is fixed on an alloy frame the entry angle of the projectiles can be adjusted between 30 and 90 the settings of the experiment are illustrated in fig 1 the experimental devices include high speed camera water tank lamps frosted glass crossbow and fixtures high speed camera the side wall of water tank frosted glass and lamps are arranged in a straight line the high speed camera is phantom v12 1 the frame rates range from 5000 to 10000 fps frames per second the projectiles are manufactured using high carbon steel the projectiles with three types of nose are shown in fig 2 the diameter d 8 m m for cone shaped nose the cone angle is defined as θ the cone angles of these cone shaped noses are θ 63 and θ 91 respectively for ogival nose the shape is described using c r h caliber radius head which is defined as c r h l d where l is the length of the nose the measured ogival nose c r h 1 15 the experiments of the water entry of the projectiles are carried out in 9 groups which are numbered as case a to case i table 1 shows the parameters of these projectiles in each group the entry angles β are set at 35 48 70 and 90 respectively the entry velocities of projectiles with overall length l 30 m m 40 m m and 50 m m are different due to their masses each case is repeated up to three times in case of failures due to disturbances 3 experimental results 3 1 the overall results of the stability of trajectories the projectiles are lunched along a sliding rail using a crossbow they penetrate the water surface at set angles the time t 0 is defined when the projectile contacts the water surface and the subsequent time is defined based on this physical time the projectiles could deviate from their original trajectories due to the disturbance of the launching device and or the hydrodynamic impact forces the projectiles would tumble and their trajectories will become unstable we outline the overall status of the projections in table 2 as the projectiles penetrate water surface the deflections are either counterclockwise or clockwise in general the number of counter clockwise deflections is more than that of clockwise deflections the overall success rate of water entry without deflections is over 40 the success rate is 50 with ogival nose the success of water entry is affected by the initial velocities and the shapes of the noses of the projectiles when the projectiles are accelerated along the rail of the crossbow the initial velocity would be off the axis of the projectiles and the hydrodynamic force will further result in the deflection of the trajectories for water entry of projectiles with deflections three typical deflections of case h at different entry angles are presented the length of projectile l 49 82 m m the cone angle of the nose θ 91 89 and the mass m 18 3 g in fig 3 the projectile enters water at β 35 a free surface elevation on the upper side of the contact point and a splash can be observed the cavity forms as the flow detaches from the nose of the projectile the projectile rotates counterclockwise and its tail contacts the cavity surface at t 3 m s the cavity surface has been destroyed in a few milliseconds afterward however the surface closure of the cavity seems not affected fig 4 shows the clockwise deflection of the projectile at entry angle β 48 as the projectile entering water the clockwise deflection can be seen and the tail of the projectile contacts the surface of cavity at t 5 m s fig 5 further shows the counterclockwise deflection of the projectile at entry angle β 70 the tail of the projectile contacts the cavity wall at t 7 m s comparing with the deflections in figs 3 and 4 the physical time of contacting with cavity surface has been delayed when the projectile impacts on water surface obliquely the nose is the only wetted area the hydrodynamic pressure over the nose is not axi symmetric wu and sun 2014 the uneven pressure distribution produces a biased hydrodynamic force and moment which results in the rotational motion and the deviation of the trajectory when the projectile is disturbed by the hydrodynamic impact force it cannot return to its original trajectory since there is no restoring force and righting moment if the velocity of the projectile is off the radical axis the hydrodynamic force at the beginning of the penetration will further increase this deflection and the trajectory becomes unstable fig 6 shows the vertical water entry of a projectile there is no deflection and the projectile moves out of the screen the typical features including the splash cavity re entrain jet and the surface closure can be seen during the water entry of projectile as the cavity collapses a new cavity inflates inside the supercavity at t 7 m s this second cavity is a new phenomenon in the high speed water entry as the screen frame is limited the projectile run out of sight and some details of these phenomena have been omitted 3 2 the motions of the projectiles and the profiles of cavities the water is displaced by the projectiles as they contact the water surface the cavity forms when the flow passes the nose and separates at the edge of the nose it is expected that the nose shape dominates the flow pattern the motions of the projectiles and the profile of the cavities we compare the motions of projectiles with cone shaped noses and ogival nose the cone angle θ 63 06 θ 91 89 and the c r h 1 15 respectively parameters including length and mass can be referred to case g case h and case i in table 1 the entry angles are β 48 fig 7 presents the horizontal and vertical components of the velocities and displacements the velocity is obtained from the time difference against the displacement it is the average velocity within each sequential time step as shown in fig 7 a and b the initial velocities of these projectiles are nearly the same the velocities of projectile with cone shaped nose θ 91 89 decrease more quickly while the velocities of projectile with ogival nose c r h 1 15 decrease slower this suggests that the cone shaped nose results larger resistance and the ogival nose leads to smaller resistance consequently the entry distance of projectile with ogival nose increases more quickly as seen in fig 7 c and d the slopes of the velocities and displacements indicate the difference of the drag coefficients of these projectiles the cavities induced by these projectiles of different nose shapes are shown in fig 8 the entry distance from the contact point s 149 m m the maximum radical diameter of the cavity below the initial calm water surface is defined as b the measured maximum diameters for case g h and i are b 38 6 m m b 41 8 m m and b 34 7 m m respectively the cone shaped nose with θ 91 89 induces the largest cavity and the ogival nose induces smallest cavity it means that the displaced water volume of case h is more since the cavity size is larger we also observe that the free surface elevation and the height of the splash are positively related to the size of the cavity more energy is imparted into the water in the perspective of energy conservation in other words the losses of kinematic energy of the projectiles are positive related to the size of the cavity from the figure the counterclockwise deflections in fig 8 a and c can be seen the cavity surface will be destroyed in a few minisecond the motions of projectiles of same cone shaped nose but different length and initial velocity are investigated parameters are listed as case a case d and case g in table 1 the entry angle β 35 fig 9 shows the axial velocities horizontal and vertical components of the velocities and displacements as shown in fig 9 a b and c the velocities and their components of shorter projectile decrease more quickly while the velocities of longer projectile decreases slower however the lines of velocities of short projectile are above those of longer projectile as a result the lines of entry distances of shorter projectile are over those of longer projectiles as seen in fig 9 d and e considering the different initial velocity and mass the drag coefficients of these projectiles require further analysis the cavities induced by these projectiles of different lengths and masses are shown in fig 10 the entry distance from the contact point s 144 m m the measured maximum radical diameters of the cavity of case a d and g are b 44 5 m m the shapes of the cavities are the same although the entry velocities and physical time are different it is observed that the free surface elevation and the height of the splash are quite similar minor counterclockwise deflections in fig 10 a b and c can be seen this could be caused by the biased hydrodynamic force when the projectile contacts the water surface the shadow inside of the cavity which would be the mixture of air and steam is not exactly the same this might be resulted by different pressure due to various velocities of the projectiles generally the cavity shape is dominated by the shape of the nose of the projectile 3 3 the evolution of the cavity of the projectile travelling a longer distance we note that oblique water entry of the projectile would show detailed evolution of the cavity since a longer travelling distance can be recorded the oblique water entry of the projectile of case a at entry angle β 48 is carried out the evolution of the cavities without deflection has been recorded fig 11 shows that a new cavity inside the first cavity appears at t 2 m s this second cavity develops from a thin water layer detached from the tail of the projectile the new cavity inflates radically and axially and it merges with the outer cavity surface as the entry distance increases further we can see the shade around the projectile it would be the mixture of air and steam truscott et al 2014 where the light can t penetrate this area at the same time the shadow area appear around the rear of the cavity near free surface where the collapse of cavity occurs fig 12 shows the collapse of the first cavity and further expansion of the second cavity the gap between the first cavity and the second cavity disappears the surfaces of these two cavities merge except the cap of the second cavity the second cavity becomes the major cavity as the first cavity collapses the second cavity resembles a spindle apparatus with a wake tail inside the cavity a re entrain jet flow which could be the mixture of air and steam is moving towards the projectile at t 6 29 m s the third cavity appears at the tail of the projectile it can be seen in fig 13 that the re entrain of air steam mixture at the rear of the cavity when it collapses the second cavity is filled with the mixture at t 9 14 m s the radical impact flow at the rear of the cavity results the re entrain flow as the second cavity collapses the third cavity develops at the tail of the projectile the third cavity starts to expand as shown in fig 14 the collapse of the cavity leaves a wake flow because of the limitation of the screen the projectile and part of the cavity is out of sight the new cavity develops inside the old cavity and the new cavity becomes the major cavity as the old cavity collapses there could be a few cycles of collapse of old cavity and generation of new cavity during the evolution of the cavities the formation of new cavity is complex the pressure would be low at the separation point at the edge of the nose there could be phase transition of water and vapor part of the mixture could become a water layer attached on the surface of projectile and this water layer forms the second and third cavities besides there could be oscillation of pressure inside the cavities bodily et al 2014 wang et al 2015b which would result in the oscillation of acceleration of the projectile 4 numerical simulation of the initial stage of the water entry the oblique water entries of projectiles can be simulated through computational fluid dynamics details of the flow field can be analysed the commercial software star ccm version 12 02 is adopted to simulate the interactions of projectiles and the water considering the coupled motion of projectiles the overset mesh techniques and dfbi dynamic fluid body interaction method are used there is a background mesh block with an air water interface and an overset mesh block which is moving along with the projectile data exchange between background mesh and overset mesh is realized by the least square interpolation the turbulence model is realizable k ε the vof model is adopted to capture the air water interface with liquid volume fraction 0 5 the implicit unsteady algorithm is used for velocity pressure coupling and the second order scheme is used for temporal discretization the same numerical scheme had been used to investigated the oblique water entry of wedge yang and xu 2018 the computational domain of the water entry of the projectiles is the same as that of the experiment for high speed water entry the local pressure may be lower than the vapor pressure of water the cavitation source term based on the schnerr sauer model has been included where the compressibility and surface tension have been ignored the study of the independence of time resolution and mesh resolution is carried out firstly the water entry of a projectile with cone shaped nose is simulated the parameters of the projectile is the same as case h in table 1 and the entry angle β 48 table 3 presents the mesh resolution and the time step intervals in the convergence study the computational domain and the typical meshes are shown in fig 15 the horizontal and vertical components of the acceleration and velocity of the projectile are shown in fig 16 the numerical results with different meshes and time step intervals agree well with each other the acceleration components increase from zero to its maximum as the nose of the projectile contacts the water surface it decreases as the projectile entering water the velocity components of the projectile decrease significantly in a few milliseconds in general the calculated horizontal and vertical components of velocity agree with those of experiment where the velocity of projectile is obtained from the difference of its displacement against time we further compare the snapshot of cavity at various instant in fig 17 a the profiles of the cavities agree with those of experiment the re entrain of the water jet can be seen when the closure of the cavity happens the cavity collapses and leaves a wake tail when the projectile travels a longer distance it resembles a spindle apparatus similar to that in fig 12 as shown in fig 17 b the pressure contour and the velocity of the flow field are further presented in fig 18 the highest pressure is observed at the tip of the sharp nose it decreases outwards and the pressure contour looks like a mushroom the low pressure area is found in the cavity high speed re entrain flow moving toward the tail of the projectile can be found in the cavity as shown in fig 18 b this shall be caused by the air suction and the impact of radical flow during the closure of free surface the direction of jet flow inside the cavity is described using arrows and the color represents the magnitude of the velocity the flow velocity decreases significantly with a short radical distance off the projectile the physics of the evolution of the cavity is complex it contains the mixture of water air and steam in addition there could be physical transitions of water to steam or steam to water during the water entry we note the second cavities observed in the experiment however present commercial code is incapable to simulate the development of second cavity and longtime evolution the phase transition of the steam to water is not included in the numerical modeling further numerical simulations are confined to the initial stage of the water entry in following simulations the mesh size of d x 2 0 0015 m and δ t 6 0 10 6 are adopted to assure the accuracy and the economy of computer resource the water entries of projectiles with different lengths and masses are further simulated the mass of the projectile is positively related to the length the initial entry velocities of the projectiles are v 0 127 5 m s v 0 91 2 m s and v 0 80 0 m s the corresponding masses are m 10 0 g m 14 5 g m 18 0 g respectively the time histories of velocities of these projectiles are shown in fig 19 as the projectiles penetrate the water surface the huge impact force results the deceleration of the projectile it can be seen in fig 19 a and b that the velocity components decrease more significantly when the entry speed is higher these curves agree well with the experimental data in fig 9 although the parameters of the simulation are not exactly the same as those of experiment fig 20 shows the drag coefficient c d the drag coefficient is defined as c d f 0 5 ρ v 2 a with a 0 25 π d 2 it increases dramatically and experience minor oscillations at beginning of the water entry it becomes stable after the supercavity forms it is interesting to see that the stable drag coefficients of these projectiles are generally in good agreement although the entry speeds and the masses of the projectiles are different the minor discrepancy would be caused by the difference of the pressure inside the cavity the numerical results indicate that the drag coefficients are dominated by the wetted nose of the projectile and the contributions of mass and the entry speed are less significant the water entries of projectile case h at different entry angles are simulated although the shapes of the noses are the same the wetted areas are different when it contacts the water surface for nose with cone angle θ 91 5 the edge of the nose touches the water surface first when β 35 after the cavity forms the nose of the projectile is fully wetted the time histories of velocities of the projectile at various entry angles are shown in fig 21 the axial velocities decline at the same rate except at the very beginning of the entry as shown in fig 21 a the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity are shown in fig 21 b and c these components are generally the cosine and sinusoidal components of the axial velocity the typical profiles of the cavities at t 1 8 m s are shown in fig 22 the profiles of these cavities agree with those snapshots from experiments the corresponding hydrodynamic forces are shown in fig 23 a the axial hydrodynamic force f increases sharply and the peak is found as soon as the projectile contacts the water the peak impact force is lower when the entry angle is shallower the drag coefficients c d are further presented in fig 23 b the peak drag coefficient is found at the beginning of the water entry it declines as the supercavity forms the variation of added mass dominates the total hydrodynamic force at the initial stage of water entry wang et al 2019 when the entry of angle is shallow the increase of added mass is less than those of larger entry angles after the flow separation and the development of the supercavity the drag coefficients become stable and are the same this indicates that the stable drag coefficient depends on the shape of the wetted nose of the projectile after it entering water surface the effects of entry angle are less significant except the initial stage of the entry the non dimensional pressure distributions p p 0 0 5 ρ v 2 on the line cutting by a vertical plane through its radical axis are shown in fig 24 where p 0 and ρ are the ambient air pressure and density of water respectively as the nose touches the water surface the pressure on the lower side is higher than that of the upper side it is observed that the pressure is nearly zero on the upper side of the nose when β 35 at t 0 05 m s while the pressure is symmetric with β 90 the pressure on the nose is symmetric and in good agreements when the nose is fully wetted e g t 0 5 m s and t 3 m s the water entries of projectiles with different noses are simulated further the mass m 18 3 g the entry speed v 0 80 m s and the entry angle β 48 the time histories of the velocities are shown in fig 25 the projectiles with three cone shaped noses and one ogival nose are simulated as the projectiles entering water the velocities decrease in the manner of linear function the slope of the curve of velocity with cone angle θ 150 is the steepest while that of projectile with ogival nose is mild this indicates that the drag coefficient is higher with larger cone angle fig 26 presents the drag forces and the drag coefficients against time these drag forces decrease as the velocities decrease however the drag coefficients become steady after the development of supercavities although peak values appear at the beginning of the water entry when cone angle θ 150 and θ 91 5 the drag coefficient is higher with nose of larger cone angle and the drag coefficient is the lowest with ogival nose the pressure distributions over the wetted nose are shown in fig 27 when the nose contacts the water surface at t 0 05 m s the pressure on the lower side is higher the pressure on the upper side is much lower the unsymmetrical pressure about its axis would cause the biased force and rotational moment resulting the deflection of the trajectory as the projectiles penetrate the water and cavities form the pressure becomes axi symmetrical the highest pressure is found at the tip of the nose the pressure distribution is sharp with fine nose while the pressure distribution is full when the nose is blunt as shown in fig 27 b and c the pressure distribution illustrates the difference of drag coefficients 5 concluding remarks the water entry of projectile at high oblique velocity has been investigated experimentally and numerically the entry velocities range from v 0 80 0 m s to v 0 127 5 m s deflections of the trajectories have been found in the experiment and the cavity surface is destroyed as the projectile contacts the cavity surface for water entry without deflection the drag coefficients and the profiles of the cavities depend on the shape of the nose the evolutions of cavities with second and third cavities during the oblique water entry are observed as the first cavity collapses the second cavity develops and inflates as the projectile entering water the second cavity merges with the first cavity then the third cavity occurs when the second cavity collapses the collapses of old cavity and expansion of new cavity occur alternatively in the development of these cavities the pressure in the cavity is low and there could be phase transition of steam and water further investigations are required with the help of higher speed camera with higher resolutions numerical simulations of the oblique water entry of projectiles at initial stage are carried out the pressure distribution is not axi symmetrical about its radical axis at the beginning of oblique water entry this would cause the deflection of the trajectory when the entry angle is shallow the drag coefficient on the projectile is dominated by the shape of the nose the contributions of mass entry speed and entry angle are secondary the drag coefficient of the projectile is lower when the nose is sharp the drag coefficient is higher when the nose is blunt the development of the second and the third cavities are first observed however the physical transition of water and steam is beyond the scope of present commercial software further development of new modeling of the numerical method is required for high fidelity simulations of the full process of the water entry besides the surface tension of cavity during the closure of cavity shall be included ni et al 2016 credit authorship contribution statement z j song software data curation writing original

21714,an improved dynamic modelling approach using cfd is proposed to study the underwater motion of a dropped cylinder firstly validation studies on rans simulated flow past two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d cylinders circular and square sectioned are carried out the predicted drag coefficients and pressure distribution for 2d and 3d cylinders are both in good agreement with corresponding experiments urans simulated results including quantification of mean surface pressure coefficient fluid velocity and instantaneous drag coefficient and streamlines are compared between 2d circular cylinder 3d circular cylinder and 3d square prism finally the cfd predicted drag coefficients are applied to study the free falling of a horizontal cylinder under calm water and current respectively both 3d effects and cylinder shape effects are studied and found to greatly affect the motion of the cylinder by changing the drag coefficient keywords circular cylinder square prism drag coefficient water entry freely falling cfd 1 introduction the topic of dropped underwater cylinders has caught attention from many areas during offshore operations objects may be accidently dropped from offshore platforms into the water it is necessary to set a specified risk free zone on the seabed to protect the subsea equipment from being hit by the dropped objects in the aerospace industry reusable rockets such as the first stage of space x s falcon 9 failed to land on the drone ship and fell off the ships requiring a search on the seabed for recovery many researchers have chosen the circular cylinder or ellipsoidal cylinder as the object to study its motion after being dropped into water considering the falling process underwater it will last until hitting the seabed numerical methods such as cfd simulations are very time consuming to solve the whole dropping process of the cylinder through water depth of thousands of meters also the uncertain perturbations and noise at releasing conditions random perturbations from current or waves cannot be avoided in the real freely falling situations to study the uncertainty of the freely falling process an appropriate random process model such as monte carlo model is required in monte carlo simulations a large number of simulations should be completed to obtain all the possible trajectories and landing points caused by those uncertain perturbations and noises because of too much computation time cfd simulations cannot work well with the monte carlo model to describe the uncertainties during the process thus some researchers proposed analytical and empirical combined methods to describe this kind of falling process aanesland 1987 kim et al 2002 chu et al 2005 xiang et al 2017 alsos and faltinsen 2018 during the falling process there are usually two limiting situations a circular cylinder subject to horizontal cross flow with velocity u induced by current and a circular cylinder experiencing vertical cross flow with velocity v caused by gravity effect and initial settling velocity in the water as shown in fig 1 as pointed out by aanesland 1987 the accuracy of the predicted trajectory of the circular cylinder is very dependent on the cross flow hydrodynamic coefficients for the cylinder some researchers applied the drag coefficient from experiment into predicting the falling circular cylinder such as chu 2005 used rouses 1938 xiang et al 2017 used hoerner 1965 and alsos and faltinsen 2018 used sarpkaya 1966 in addition to those using existing drag coefficients obtained experimentally there have been several other classical researches about the relationship between the drag coefficient and reynolds number reported in the literature by wieselsberger 1922 finn 1953 tritton 1959 at the same time some associated physical phenomena during the cross flow such as vortex shedding flow separation and turbulence have been studied in detail by many researchers catalano et al 2003 kozlov et al 2011 hu et al 2015 nishimura et al 2000 dutta et al 2008 gera et al 2010 agbaglah and mavriplis 2019 however in the above drag studies they either studied a 2d circular cylinder or always assumed that the length of the cylinder is much greater than its diameter and ignored the free end effect the cylinder is treated as an infinite cylinder or simplified as a 2d segment shown in fig 1 but an infinite model or 2d segment is not realistic to capture phenomena such as alternating vortex shedding sumner 2013 which may cause large fluctuating pressure forces noise vibrations in a real 3d finite circular cylinder as also pointed out by stone 2017 by introducing additional vertical vortex structures in the flow region around the cylinder the presence of free ends of the 3d finite circular cylinder makes the problem more complicated thus the application of drag coefficient of infinite model or 2d segment into predicting the motion of a real 3d finite circular cylinder is not accurate it is very necessary to study the flow past a 3d finite cylinder with free ends especially with two free ends and to calculate the correct drag coefficient since related studies remain relatively unexplored as mentioned by escobar et al 2013 in the current research a dynamic modelling approach improved by cfd is proposed to study the underwater motion of the dropped cylinder shear stress transport k ω sst turbulence closure model in openfoam has been verified to be able to accurately predict the drag coefficients for 2d and 3d finite cylinders comparative numerical analyses for the flow at the same reynolds number past a 2d circular cylinder 3d circular cylinder and 3d square prism are conducted the calculated results in terms of time averaged surface pressure coefficient fluid velocity and instantaneous drag coefficients and streamlines are compared between 3d circular cylinders and square prisms compared with 2d drag coefficients the accuracy of the dynamic modelling approach to predict the motions of the dropped circular cylinder is improved under both calm water and current conditions by using the 3d drag coefficient predicted by cfd at last the trajectory of a square prism is studied and compared with the circular cylinder 2 dynamical modelling of a falling cylinder underwater to describe the motions of a freely falling horizontal cylinder through the water two coordinate systems are used inertial system oxyz and body fixed system oxyz are used as shown in fig 2 xiang et al 2017 the equations of motion include the dynamic equations 1 u 1 m g b sin θ f d x f i x w ω y v ω z l g ω y 2 ω z 2 2 v 1 m g b cos θ sin φ f d y f i y u ω z l g ω z 3 w 1 m g b cos θ cos φ f d z f i z u ω y l g ω y 4 ω y 1 j y m d y m i y m g b y

angular rate along x y and z axis it is noted that if the axial rotation rate along x axis is zero at the initial moment the rotation rate will always stay very close to zero during falling process because the physics of a cylinder with axial rotation during falling process will be more complicated than without axial rotation to simplify the problem there is the assumption that no axial rotations along x axis exist namely ω x 0 at the initial moment also during the whole falling process the symbols θ and φ are pitch and yaw angles j y and j z are the moment of the inertia of the cylinder with respect to y and z axis respectively 2 1 hydrostatic forces and moments the hydrostatic force refers to the buoyancy force b the hydrostatic moment m g b is the moment caused by the offset l g between the center of gravity force g and the center of buoyancy force b here l g 0 m g b y 0 and m g b z 0 because the center of gravity force and the center of buoyancy force overlap 2 2 hydrodynamic forces and moments according to the slender body theory proposed by newman 1977 the inertial forces in y and z axis are 6 f i y v m 22 ω y m 24 u v m 22 x t u ω z x t m 22 x t 7 f i z w m 33 ω z m 35 u w m 33 x t u ω y x t m 33 x t and induced moments in y and z axis are 8 m i y w m 35 ω y m 55 u w m 33 x t m 33 x t u ω y m 35 x t 2 m 33 x t 9 m i z v m 26 ω z m 66 u v m 22 x t m 22 x t u ω z m 26 x t 2 m 22 x t the y and z directional added mass coefficients at the trailing edge are given as m 22 x t and m 33 x t for a slender rigid body whose end is a point of zero transverse dimensions m 33 x t 0 m 22 x t 0 d alembert s paradox states the lateral force acting on such a body in steady motion will be zero but because the ends of the cylinder are not pointed m 33 x t 0 m 22 x t 0 correspondingly an additional force component is included to consider the trailing edge effect for a long slender body this additional force component is composed of all the x t related terms in eqs 6 and 7 where x t is the longitudinal position of effective trailing edge 2 3 viscous forces and moments here the cylinder is assumed to be falling without longitudinal motions thus f d x 0 the drag force along y and z axis can be expressed through 10 f d y 1 2 ρ c d y d 0 5 l 0 5 l v ω z x v ω z x d x 11 f d z 1 2 ρ c d z d 0 5 l 0 5 l w ω y x w ω y x d x the induced drag force moment with respect to the y and z axis can be described as 12 m d y 1 2 ρ c d z d 0 5 l 0 5 l x w ω y x w ω y x d x 13 m d z 1 2 ρ c d y d 0 5 l 0 5 l x v ω z x v ω z x d x it can be found from eqs 10 13 that the viscous forces and moments are determined by the drag coefficients and in turn affect the motions of the cylinders into the water thus it is necessary to use the correct drag coefficient value at corresponding velocity or reynolds number a few discrete values of reynolds number are selected in the range of interest to calculate the drag coefficient so that the drag coefficient may be estimated by interpolation for any value of speed within that range in this study the reynolds number will vary between 102 106 corresponding to the subcritical and supercritical reynolds number the drag coefficient is predicted by the open source cfd code openfoam the calculated drag coefficient for a few constant reynolds numbers corresponding to this range will be presented in the following 3 cfd study on drag coefficient 3 1 governing equations the governing equations for the unsteady incompressible flow past a fixed cylinder are the conservation equations for mass and momentum namely the

stable thomas 1995 3 3 model set up 3 3 1 2d and 3d computational domain and boundary condition the computational domain and the boundary conditions for the simulation of the flow around circular cylinders are shown in fig 3 which depicts the view of the computational domain and boundary conditions for 2d and 3d simulations the computational domain is a closed box with the dimensions 0 45 m 0 5 m 0 5m for 3d simulations and an open single layer plate with the planar dimensions of 0 5 m 0 5 m for 2d simulations the circular cylinder and square cylinders are simulated with the diameter d 0 02 m and side length of 0 02 m respectively 3d cylinders have a length of l 0 1m and an aspect ratio of l d 5 the origin of the coordinate system used in the simulations is right at the geometric center of both cylinders for 3d simulations the center of the cylinder is located at 5d away from the top end 20d away from the bottom end and 12 5d away from the 4 vertical sides the left and the right hand sides front and back sides of the computational domain 2d simulations have the same geometric arrangement as 3d except only a single layer of cells is present generated between the two sides vertical downward uniform velocities varying corresponding to re ranging from 102 to 106 are defined at the top end as an inlet condition the bottom end is introduced to be the outlet boundary with an average reference gauge pressure p 0 in 3d simulations the 4 vertical sides all have slip boundary condition in 2d simulations the front and back sides are defined the same boundary as 3d but the left and right sides are defined as empty boundary the cylinder body is treated as a wall representing a no slip and impermeable boundary condition where flow velocity is zero at the wall surfaces and the pressure is set to be the zero normal gradient the entire fluid domain is discretized into hexahedra dominant elements as shown by the local view of the computational mesh in fig 4 the element size nearest to the cylinder is small enough so that the boundary layer is fully resolved with y of around 1 3 3 2 solver rans simulations known as reynolds averaged navier stokes simulation are adopted to obtain the drag coefficients of the flow past the cylinder the governing equations eqs 14 and 15 are solved in an ensemble averaged form in openfoam which has been used as a reliable tool to study many complicated flow problems such as wind flow past a horizontal axis wind turbine in costa et al 2014 and the flow past an inclined circular disk in tian et al 2017 since here the final steady state value of drag coefficient is the only interest a steady flow solver simplefoam is used 3 4 convergence and validation study the optimum mesh size is selected by a convergence study in this study the size of the grid cells is found to greatly affect the simulation results as shown in table 1 to fully and accurately resolve the boundary layer an adequate number of elements and well organized grids are required within and near the boundary layers several mesh refinements are applied into resolving the flow separation from the cylinders and the wake flow vortex street behind the cylinders four typical simulations with different meshes and time steps are performed the simulated results are compared with the experimental data of wieselsberger 1922 as shown in table 1 the mesh is generated by first creating structured background elements and then refining a specified refinement area with a given refinement level the second column of table 1 presents the number of structured background elements before refinement in x y and z direction for each case later a refinement level of 4 means in the refinement area of 0 2 m 0 1 m 0 1m enclosing the cylinder the size ratio of the outermost element to the innermost element is 24 1 with fine and finer mesh arrangement the simulated drag coefficient almost converges and the value is slightly larger than the experimental value in order to maintain accurate simulation results as well as fast calculations the fine mesh simulation with 100 175 225 elements with refinement level 4 and a time step of 0 00001s are applied in the following study in order to validate the cfd predicted results of the flow past the cylinders the drag coefficient obtained from the simulations has been compared with other published data of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations the drag coefficient is the drag force f d acting on the cylinder non dimensionalized by 34 c d f d 1 2 ρ a u 2 where a is the projected area of the cylinder ρ is the mass density of the water u is the incoming velocity at the inlet 3 4 1 circular cylinder firstly the predicted 2d drag coefficients are compared with 2d experimental data in hoerner 1965 and gao et al 2018 at different reynolds numbers in fig 5 in these 2d experiment the free end effects can be neglected because of two reasons 1 the l d of the cylinder is so large that the cylinder can be assumed to be an infinite cylinder 2 the cylinder is tested between two flat walls the free ends of the cylinder are directly connected to these two walls so that no fluid can pass between it is found that the simulated 2d drag coefficients are satisfactory the predicted drag coefficients of a 3d circular cylinder at different reynolds number are compared with experimental data of finite 3d circular cylinder with two free ends in wieselsberger 1922 and simulated results in gao et al 2018 the simulated drag coefficients in the present study show much better agreement with experimental data in wieselsberger 1922 than the simulated data in gao et al 2018 this is because the present cylinder is the same one used by wieselsberger 1922 but gao et al 2018 used a different cylinder with the aspect ratio of 1 5 which is much smaller than wieselsberger 1922 it is found that the drag coefficient in the present paper is found to be larger than gao et al 2018 before re reaching 104 however when re is larger than a certain number around 104 the drag coefficient in the present paper gradually becomes smaller than gao et al 2018 with re continuously increasing to a critical number both the 2d cylinder and 3d cylinder in present study experience drag drop at this critical reynolds number but in gao et al 2018 this drag drop cannot be observed and the cd re curve becomes flat the above difference between present study and gao et al 2018 is attributed to the difference of aspect ratio between the cylinders it may be because the 3d cylinder with a smaller aspect ratio will present more significant free end effects on the flow field correspondingly the induced flow characteristics will be very different from a cylinder with larger aspect ratio and an infinite cylinder or a 2d cylinder which has no free ends through further comparisons of drag coefficient of the 3d cylinder and 2d cylinder the drag coefficient of 3d cylinder is found to be generally much smaller than the 2d cylinder therefore every 3d cylinder with different finite length deserves its own investigation instead of being simplified into a 2d cylinder the pressure distribution on the surface of the cylinder is also studied the pressure coefficient on the surface of the cylinder is defined as follows 35 c p p p 0 1 2 ρ u 2 with p the static pressure pa fig 6 shows the comparison of 2d circular cylinder and experiment data by falchsbart in zdravkovich 1997 at re 6 7 105 fig 7 displays the comparison of 3d circular cylinder and experimental data with the aspect ratio l d 1 5 at re 2 55 105 in zdravkovich 1997 both comparisons show good agreement although the simulated pressure coefficient is slightly larger than experiment which is also observed by gomez and richmond 2016 this small difference is because the rans equations use empirical formulations for the reynolds stresses that may not model the wide range of time and length scales presented in the flow 3 4 2 square prism since the mesh and numerical settings are the same with circular cylinder the validation of the circular cylinder above also lays a solid foundation and convincing proof for simulating the square prism the cd re curves for 2d and 3d square prisms are both displayed in fig 8 the predicted drag force coefficients of 2d square prism at re 2 0 104 and re 4 0 104 are 2 33 and 2 48 respectively which are slightly larger than experimental value 2 2 and 2 34 by lyn et al 1995 and nishimura 2001 fig 9 shows the pressure distribution on the surface of the cylinder at re 2 0 104 which agrees well with lee et al 1975 bearman et al 1982 nishimura et al 2000 s experimental results although two concave points can be observed on x 0 5 and 1 5 which are right located at the separation point and the back of the cylinder respectively this difference is induced by k ω sst model itself because it is based on the boussinesq approximation which slightly reduces the accuracy of flow separations the negative pressure value around the second concave point at the back of the cylinder is much larger than experiment which right explains why the simulated drag coefficients are larger than experiment in fig 8 all these agreements indicate that rans simulation can be applied into predicting the drag force and pressure acting on a square prism 3 5 time averaged results to explain the differences between 2d and 3d cylinders by examining the flow field a transient simulation urans is adopted because of its ability of investigating the transient behavior such as streamlines vortex time history of drag coefficient etc based on steady simulations unsteady rans urans simulations are conducted for flow past both square prisms and circular cylinders a transient flow solver pisofoam is used in this section courant number is set to be always less than 1 to ensure the accuracy of the simulations the drag coefficients obtained through urans are compared with experiment and steady rans as shown in table 2 although rans can give good predictions for drag coefficient which has been verified in the above section a generally better agreement with experimental data verified the capability of urans simulations into better solving the problem of the flow past the cylinders as an analytical tool the time averaged results also afford a comparison with other published velocity results on the flow around a square prism in this section the time averaged results are presented including the pressure velocity distributions and streamlines the pressure coefficients velocity and streamlines are averaged based on the full statistical time after solutions getting converged therefore the statistical time used in this study is long enough to give reliable results for the periodic case the time averaged 2d drag coefficients are obtained by averaging 20 cycles of time history data after convergence for the non periodic case the time averaged 3d drag coefficients are obtained by averaging the data during at least 200 non dimensional time units after convergence it has been checked carefully that the differences between the force coefficients based on the full statistical time and the halved statistical time are the same therefore the statistical time used in this study is long enough to give reliable results 3 5 1 surface pressure fig 10 and fig 11 show the time averaged pressure distributions on the surface of the circular cylinder and square prism respectively from the leading edge to the trailing edge in each figure the pressure on the bottom of the 2d cylinder and the center cross section of the 3d cylinders are compared it can be found that the curve trends of 2d cylinder and 3d cylinder are the same but the pressure coefficients around the 2d cylinder are generally much larger than 3d cylinders this is because unlike the absolute constraint on the flow past 2d cylinder in longitudinal direction the 3d cylinder can allow the water to flow along the bottom of cylinder and exit at two free ends which helps to release the impact energy at the center as a result the pressure is much less than 2d cylinder in fig 11 the positive pressure is observed within the majority of the front surface of the square cylinder except for those areas very near the corner this is mainly because the front surface of the square cylinder is perpendicular to the incoming flow as a result the velocity from the streamwise direction will suddenly change to the transverse direction at the front surface of the cylinder and finally the streamwise velocity reduces to almost zero but for a circular cylinder the positive pressure is only covering a limited area ranging approximately 39 from the middle point of the front surface of the 3d cylinder the difference of the pressure distributions between square cylinder and circular cylinder also results in the fact that the drag coefficient of the square prism is larger than the corresponding circular cylinder also the urans simulated pressure distributions are compared with rans simulations and corresponding published experimental data of a 2d square prism it is found that rans and urans simulated results of a 2d square prism show the similar trend but the urans simulated results match the experimental data slightly better 3 5 2 velocity distribution fig 12 shows the side view of the velocity distribution on the surface of the circular cylinder or square prism in fig 12 the comparisons of 2d 3d circular cylinder and 3d square prism are shown in a row the velocity contours are approximately symmetric about the centerline of the cylinder as a critical parameter to describe the starting wake behind the cylinder the recirculation region is defined as the distance from the cylinder center to the stagnation point in present comparisons the recirculation length of the 3d cylinder is much larger compared with present 2d cylinder thus the streamwise velocity recovers much faster in 2d cylinder than 3d cylinder also the 3d circular cylinder recovers much faster than square prism it can be found that the fluctuations of the velocity field caused by the square prism is much larger than the circular cylinder 3 6 instantaneous fluctuations in addition to these time averaged parameters instantaneous parameters that can reflect the unsteady flow characteristics such as instantaneous drag coefficient streamlines can also be obtained through the urans simulations due to the oscillation of the flow hydrodynamic forces including drag become unsteady and start to show periodic or quasi periodic oscillations with time 3 6 1 streamlines vorticity fig 13 shows the side view of instantaneous streamlines past 2d circular cylinder 3d circular cylinder and square prism respectively fig 14 and fig 15 show the bottom and front view of instantaneous streamlines past 3d circular cylinder and square prism respectively compared with 2d cylinder additional vortex and streamlines on the free ends can be captured in 3d cylinders also instead of uniform crossing streamlines in 2d cylinder the streamlines crossing the cylinder vary along the length of the cylinder there are four spiral vortices symmetrical about the mid span of the cylinder which are also observed by gao et al 2018 these observed differences are mainly caused by the presence of the free ends at the finite 3d cylinders by comparing the square prism and circular cylinder the streamlines are almost symmetric about the center of the cylinder but the effective formation length of large scale vortices behind the square prism is larger than circular cylinder as a result the streamlines past the square prism are more turbulent to study the free end effect on the wake of the cylinder the comparison of vorticity between the 2d and 3d circular cylinders are presented in fig 16 in fig 16 a the regular formation of the vortex street can be observed behind the 2d cylinder but in fig 16 b two tip vortices that are separated alternatively from the top side and bottom side of the cylinder extend to the downstream and just form very weak vortex shedding krajnović 2011 also described the similar finding about these two tip vortices from the les simulations it is found that the free ends of the cylinder may have significant effect on suppressing the formation of vortex shedding behind 3 6 2 drag coefficient fig 17 presented the behavior of drag coefficient in time it is clearly seen that the time periodical variation of c d of a 2d cylinder experiences the regular shedding of vortex however the variation of c d of a 3d cylinder shows less regular periodicity and the time histories are more chaotic than a 2d cylinder obviously the variation of vortex structures along the cylinder length the diameter of the cylinder and additional vortex structures at the free ends observed in 3d cylinders referring to figs 14 and 15 should be responsible for the irregularity of c d also the fluctuation amplitudes of c d decrease significantly and low frequency modulations of fluctuation amplitude are observed in 3d cylinder by fft analysis of the time history data of c d for the 3d circular cylinder the low frequency f0 can be obtained as shown in fig 18 the power spectrum shows that f0 is around 3 7hz for the 3d circular cylinder which is much lower than the oscillating frequency of c d for 2d circular cylinder 18 66hz this may be because the presence of two free ends causes suppression of regular vortex shedding as shown by fig 16 also as mentioned in zhang and samtaney 2016 compared with the regular time periodic fluctuation observed in simulation with low aspect ratio this quasiperiodic modulation is also called beat phenomenon which is only noticeable in three dimensional simulations as shown in fig 12 with the stagnation point located further the wake vortices behind the square prism also start to shed further away from the rear surface compared with the circular cylinder and hence the near wake flow field is less affected the unsteady wake has insignificant effect on the drag coefficient which remains at a near constant value consequently c d shows smaller fluctuations in magnitude 4 predicted motions of the circular cylinder and square prism the free falling process of the circular cylinder dropped in lyu et al 2014 s experiments is repeated through the improved dynamic modelling method described in section 2 in section 3 it is found that the urans simulations cost much more calculation time than rans simulations though urans simulations can predict slightly better the drag coefficient than rans simulations for design and operational purposes in ocean engineering the interpolation of rans simulated drag coefficients in figs 5 and 8 are adopted into the improved dynamical model and the following trajectory predictions considering rans good behavior in both accuracy and efficiency in lyu et al 2014 s drop tests the horizontal cylinder is released above the water surface and dropped into water the motions of the cylinder started to be captured through a high speed camera when the cylinder just got immersed into water table 3 shows the property of the dropped cylinder in lyu et al 2014 s dropping experiments the slamming velocity is the vertical body velocity before water entry the velocity components in x y and z direction at t 0 ms are represented by x 0 y 0 z 0 it is noted that t 0 ms is the moment that the cylinder just gets fully immersed into water after water entry according to the experiment in lyu et al 2014 the initial velocity components x 0 y 0 z 0 are determined by both slamming velocity vs and current speed vc because we have two sets of vs and vc vs 0 5 m s vc 0 m s and vs 0 5 m s vc 0 05 m s correspondingly two initial velocity components x 0 y 0 z 0 will be 0 0 0 4755 m s and 0 0 0167 m s 0 4872 m s 4 1 three dimensional effect the predicted cylinder motions using 2d and 3d cylinder drag coefficients are compared with laboratory drop tests of lyu et al 2014 as shown in fig 19 and fig 20 fig 19 shows the comparison of vertical displacement time series from t 0 ms to t 80 ms under calm water with vs 0 5 m s the predicted vertical displacement curve using the drag coefficient of 3d circular cylinder matches the one observed in experiment very well the use of drag coefficient of 2d circular cylinder slows down the falling process compared with the experiment because the 2d drag coefficient is larger than 3d drag coefficient the drag force in z direction vertical will become larger to resist the vertical motion of the cylinder fig 20 shows the comparison of vertical displacement horizontal displacement curves of the circular cylinder with 2d and 3d drag coefficient under current vs 0 5 m s vc 0 05 m s it is found that the y z plane trajectory predicted using 3d drag coefficient agrees much better with experiment than 2d drag coefficient though the horizontal displacement predicted using 3d drag coefficient is a little smaller than the experiment this difference is because the lifting force in horizontal direction caused during freely falling is ignored in fig 19 the vertical displacement predicted by 2d drag coefficient is much smaller than 3d drag coefficient the reason is the same as discussed for fig 9 but unlike the drag force in z direction the force acting on the cylinder in y direction transverse by current will be a pushing force to move the cylinder further away thus the use of 2d drag coefficient will cause a larger y directional displacement than that obtained with 3d drag coefficient as shown in fig 20 4 2 the effect of cylinder shape the effect of the cylinder shape on the motion of falling cylinder is investigated by studying two different cylinders a circular cylinder and square prism respectively the vertical displacement time curves of the circular and square cylinders under calm water are compared in fig 21 it can be observed that the vertical displacement of the circular cylinder is much larger than the square cylinder because the drag coefficient of circular cylinder is less than the square prism the circular cylinder suffers less drag force during falling process with the slamming velocity increasing the difference of the vertical displacement between circular cylinder and square prism increases fig 22 shows the comparison of y z plane trajectory of the circular cylinder under current z 0 1 m s vc 1 m s 5 m s it is found that the circular cylinder moves more in the vertical direction but less in the transverse direction this is because the circular cylinder experiences less drag force in vertical direction to stop the cylinder falling and less lateral force to move the cylinder away in transverse direction compared with the square cylinder in the above case studies the three dimensional effect and cylinder shape effect both significantly influence the trajectory of the falling cylinder the improved dynamic modelling method can consider both effects by using a more accurate drag coefficient from cfd predictions due to a lager drag coefficient 5 conclusions in the present paper a dynamic modelling approach improved by cfd is proposed to study the underwater motion of the dropped cylinder the relation between the drag coefficient of the circular and square cylinder and reynolds number has been obtained by using rans simulations in openfoam and validated by comparing with past research results the urans simulations are applied for different cylinders including 2d and 3d circular cylinder and 3d square cylinder to determine the difference of their flow fluctuations including instantaneous drag coefficient streamlines and time averaged velocity and pressure distributions through through rans and urans simulation results it is found that compared with 2d cylinder the drag coefficient of 3d cylinder becomes much smaller the variation of drag coefficient with time shows less regular periodicity the fluctuation amplitudes of c d decrease significantly and low frequency modulations are observed because the free ends are found to suppress the regular vortex shedding additional vortex can be observed at the two free ends of 3d cylinder the variation of vortex along the length of the cylinder is captured the square prism will make the flow more turbulent than circular cylinder the phenomena of velocity fluctuation the vortex shedding in the flow domain and flow separations at the square prism are all more apparent at last the accuracy of the dynamic modelling approach to predict the motions of the dropped circular cylinder under calm water and current are both improved by using cfd predicted 3d drag coefficient also the improved dynamical modelling method is extended to predict the motion of another cylinder shape square prism it is found that the displacement of square prism is much smaller in vertical direction but larger

21714,an improved dynamic modelling approach using cfd is proposed to study the underwater motion of a dropped cylinder firstly validation studies on rans simulated flow past two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d cylinders circular and square sectioned are carried out the predicted drag coefficients and pressure distribution for 2d and 3d cylinders are both in good agreement with corresponding experiments urans simulated results including quantification of mean surface pressure coefficient fluid velocity and instantaneous drag coefficient and streamlines are compared between 2d circular cylinder 3d circular cylinder and 3d square prism finally the cfd predicted drag coefficients are applied to study the free falling of a horizontal cylinder under calm water and current respectively both 3d effects and cylinder shape effects are studied and found to greatly affect the motion of the cylinder by changing the drag coefficient keywords circular cylinder square prism drag coefficient water entry freely falling cfd 1 introduction the topic of dropped underwater cylinders has caught attention from many areas during offshore operations objects may be accidently dropped from offshore platforms into the water it is necessary to set a specified risk free zone on the seabed to protect the subsea equipment from being hit by the dropped objects in the aerospace industry reusable rockets such as the first stage of space x s falcon 9 failed to land on the drone ship and fell off the ships requiring a search on the seabed for recovery many researchers have chosen the circular cylinder or ellipsoidal cylinder as the object to study its motion after being dropped into water considering the falling process underwater it will last until hitting the seabed numerical methods such as cfd simulations are very time consuming to solve the whole dropping process of the cylinder through water depth of thousands of meters also the uncertain perturbations and noise at releasing conditions random perturbations from current or waves cannot be avoided in the real freely falling situations to study the uncertainty of the freely falling process an appropriate random process model such as monte carlo model is required in monte carlo simulations a large number of simulations should be completed to obtain all the possible trajectories and landing points caused by those uncertain perturbations and noises because of too much computation time cfd simulations cannot work well with the monte carlo model to describe the uncertainties during the process thus some researchers proposed analytical and empirical combined methods to describe this kind of falling process aanesland 1987 kim et al 2002 chu et al 2005 xiang et al 2017 alsos and faltinsen 2018 during the falling process there are usually two limiting situations a circular cylinder subject to horizontal cross flow with velocity u induced by current and a circular cylinder experiencing vertical cross flow with velocity v caused by gravity effect and initial settling velocity in the water as shown in fig 1 as pointed out by aanesland 1987 the accuracy of the predicted trajectory of the circular cylinder is very dependent on the cross flow hydrodynamic coefficients for the cylinder some researchers applied the drag coefficient from experiment into predicting the falling circular cylinder such as chu 2005 used rouses 1938 xiang et al 2017 used hoerner 1965 and alsos and faltinsen 2018 used sarpkaya 1966 in addition to those using existing drag coefficients obtained experimentally there have been several other classical researches about the relationship between the drag coefficient and reynolds number reported in the literature by wieselsberger 1922 finn 1953 tritton 1959 at the same time some associated physical phenomena during the cross flow such as vortex shedding flow separation and turbulence have been studied in detail by many researchers catalano et al 2003 kozlov et al 2011 hu et al 2015 nishimura et al 2000 dutta et al 2008 gera et al 2010 agbaglah and mavriplis 2019 however in the above drag studies they either studied a 2d circular cylinder or always assumed that the length of the cylinder is much greater than its diameter and ignored the free end effect the cylinder is treated as an infinite cylinder or simplified as a 2d segment shown in fig 1 but an infinite model or 2d segment is not realistic to capture phenomena such as alternating vortex shedding sumner 2013 which may cause large fluctuating pressure forces noise vibrations in a real 3d finite circular cylinder as also pointed out by stone 2017 by introducing additional vertical vortex structures in the flow region around the cylinder the presence of free ends of the 3d finite circular cylinder makes the problem more complicated thus the application of drag coefficient of infinite model or 2d segment into predicting the motion of a real 3d finite circular cylinder is not accurate it is very necessary to study the flow past a 3d finite cylinder with free ends especially with two free ends and to calculate the correct drag coefficient since related studies remain relatively unexplored as mentioned by escobar et al 2013 in the current research a dynamic modelling approach improved by cfd is proposed to study the underwater motion of the dropped cylinder shear stress transport k ω sst turbulence closure model in openfoam has been verified to be able to accurately predict the drag coefficients for 2d and 3d finite cylinders comparative numerical analyses for the flow at the same reynolds number past a 2d circular cylinder 3d circular cylinder and 3d square prism are conducted the calculated results in terms of time averaged surface pressure coefficient fluid velocity and instantaneous drag coefficients and streamlines are compared between 3d circular cylinders and square prisms compared with 2d drag coefficients the accuracy of the dynamic modelling approach to predict the motions of the dropped circular cylinder is improved under both calm water and current conditions by using the 3d drag coefficient predicted by cfd at last the trajectory of a square prism is studied and compared with the circular cylinder 2 dynamical modelling of a falling cylinder underwater to describe the motions of a freely falling horizontal cylinder through the water two coordinate systems are used inertial system oxyz and body fixed system oxyz are used as shown in fig 2 xiang et al 2017 the equations of motion include the dynamic equations 1 u 1 m g b sin θ f d x f i x w ω y v ω z l g ω y 2 ω z 2 2 v 1 m g b cos θ sin φ f d y f i y u ω z l g ω z 3 w 1 m g b cos θ cos φ f d z f i z u ω y l g ω y 4 ω y 1 j y m d y m i y m g b y m l g w m l g u ω y 5 ω z 1 j z m d z m i z m g b z m l g v m l g u ω z where m is the mass of the cylinder u v and w are translational velocity components in x y and z axis ω x ω y and ω z are the angular rate along x y and z axis it is noted that if the axial rotation rate along x axis is zero at the initial moment the rotation rate will always stay very close to zero during falling process because the physics of a cylinder with axial rotation during falling process will be more complicated than without axial rotation to simplify the problem there is the assumption that no axial rotations along x axis exist namely ω x 0 at the initial moment also during the whole falling process the symbols θ and φ are pitch and yaw angles j y and j z are the moment of the inertia of the cylinder with respect to y and z axis respectively 2 1 hydrostatic forces and moments the hydrostatic force refers to the buoyancy force b the hydrostatic moment m g b is the moment caused by the offset l g between the center of gravity force g and the center of buoyancy force b here l g 0 m g b y 0 and m g b z 0 because the center of gravity force and the center of buoyancy force overlap 2 2 hydrodynamic forces and moments according to the slender body theory proposed by newman 1977 the inertial forces in y and z axis are 6 f i y v m 22 ω y m 24 u v m 22 x t u ω z x t m 22 x t 7 f i z w m 33 ω z m 35 u w m 33 x t u ω y x t m 33 x t and induced moments in y and z axis are 8 m i y w m 35 ω y m 55 u w m 33 x t m 33 x t u ω y m 35 x t 2 m 33 x t 9 m i z v m 26 ω z m 66 u v m 22 x t m 22 x t u ω z m 26 x t 2 m 22 x t the y and z directional added mass coefficients at the trailing edge are given as m 22 x t and m 33 x t for a slender rigid body whose end is a point of zero transverse dimensions m 33 x t 0 m 22 x t 0 d alembert s paradox states the lateral force acting on such a body in steady motion will be zero but because the ends of the cylinder are not pointed m 33 x t 0 m 22 x t 0 correspondingly an additional force component is included to consider the trailing edge effect for a long slender body this additional force component is composed of all the x t related terms in eqs 6 and 7 where x t is the longitudinal position of effective trailing edge 2 3 viscous forces and moments here the cylinder is assumed to be falling without longitudinal motions thus f d x 0 the drag force along y and z axis can be expressed through 10 f d y 1 2 ρ c d y d 0 5 l 0 5 l v ω z x v ω z x d x 11 f d z 1 2 ρ c d z d 0 5 l 0 5 l w ω y x w ω y x d x the induced drag force moment with respect to the y and z axis can be described as 12 m d y 1 2 ρ c d z d 0 5 l 0 5 l x w ω y x w ω y x d x 13 m d z 1 2 ρ c d y d 0 5 l 0 5 l x v ω z x v ω z x d x it can be found from eqs 10 13 that the viscous forces and moments are determined by the drag coefficients and in turn affect the motions of the cylinders into the water thus it is necessary to use the correct drag coefficient value at corresponding velocity or reynolds number a few discrete values of reynolds number are selected in the range of interest to calculate the drag coefficient so that the drag coefficient may be estimated by interpolation for any value of speed within that range in this study the reynolds number will vary between 102 106 corresponding to the subcritical and supercritical reynolds number the drag coefficient is predicted by the open source cfd code openfoam the calculated drag coefficient for a few constant reynolds numbers corresponding to this range will be presented in the following 3 cfd study on drag coefficient 3 1 governing equations the governing equations for the unsteady incompressible flow past a fixed cylinder are the conservation equations for mass and momentum namely the

stable thomas 1995 3 3 model set up 3 3 1 2d and 3d computational domain and boundary condition the computational domain and the boundary conditions for the simulation of the flow around circular cylinders are shown in fig 3 which depicts the view of the computational domain and boundary conditions for 2d and 3d simulations the computational domain is a closed box with the dimensions 0 45 m 0 5 m 0 5m for 3d simulations and an open single layer plate with the planar dimensions of 0 5 m 0 5 m for 2d simulations the circular cylinder and square cylinders are simulated with the diameter d 0 02 m and side length of 0 02 m respectively 3d cylinders have a length of l 0 1m and an aspect ratio of l d 5 the origin of the coordinate system used in the simulations is right at the geometric center of both cylinders for 3d simulations the center of the cylinder is located at 5d away from the top end 20d away from the bottom end and 12 5d away from the 4 vertical sides the left and the right hand sides front and back sides of the computational domain 2d simulations have the same geometric arrangement as 3d except only a single layer of cells is present generated between the two sides vertical downward uniform velocities varying corresponding to re ranging from 102 to 106 are defined at the top end as an inlet condition the bottom end is introduced to be the outlet boundary with an average reference gauge pressure p 0 in 3d simulations the 4 vertical sides all have slip boundary condition in 2d simulations the front and back sides are defined the same boundary as 3d but the left and right sides are defined as empty boundary the cylinder body is treated as a wall representing a no slip and impermeable boundary condition where flow velocity is zero at the wall surfaces and the pressure is set to be the zero normal gradient the entire fluid domain is discretized into hexahedra dominant elements as shown by the local view of the computational mesh in fig 4 the element size nearest to the cylinder is small enough so that the boundary layer is fully resolved with y of around 1 3 3 2 solver rans simulations known as reynolds averaged navier stokes simulation are adopted to obtain the drag coefficients of the flow past the cylinder the governing equations eqs 14 and 15 are solved in an ensemble averaged form in openfoam which has been used as a reliable tool to study many complicated flow problems such as wind flow past a horizontal axis wind turbine in costa et al 2014 and the flow past an inclined circular disk in tian et al 2017 since here the final steady state value of drag coefficient is the only interest a steady flow solver simplefoam is used 3 4 convergence and validation study the optimum mesh size is selected by a convergence study in this study the size of the grid cells is found to greatly affect the simulation results as shown in table 1 to fully and accurately resolve the boundary layer an adequate number of elements and well organized grids are required within and near the boundary layers several mesh refinements are applied into resolving the flow separation from the cylinders and the wake flow vortex street behind the cylinders four typical simulations with different meshes and time steps are performed the simulated results are compared with the experimental data of wieselsberger 1922 as shown in table 1 the mesh is generated by first creating structured background elements and then refining a specified refinement area with a given refinement level the second column of table 1 presents the number of structured background elements before refinement in x y and z direction for each case later a refinement level of 4 means in the refinement area of 0 2 m 0 1 m 0 1m enclosing the cylinder the size ratio of the outermost element to the innermost element is 24 1 with fine and finer mesh arrangement the simulated drag coefficient almost converges and the value is slightly larger than the experimental value in order to maintain accurate simulation results as well as fast calculations the fine mesh simulation with 100 175 225 elements with refinement level 4 and a time step of 0 00001s are applied in the following study in order to validate the cfd predicted results of the flow past the cylinders the drag coefficient obtained from the simulations has been compared with other published data of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations the drag coefficient is the drag force f d acting on the cylinder non dimensionalized by 34 c d f d 1 2 ρ a u 2 where a is the projected area of the cylinder ρ is the mass density of the water u is the incoming velocity at the inlet 3 4 1 circular cylinder firstly the predicted 2d drag coefficients are compared with 2d experimental data in hoerner 1965 and gao et al 2018 at different reynolds numbers in fig 5 in these 2d experiment the free end effects can be neglected because of two reasons 1 the l d of the cylinder is so large that the cylinder can be assumed to be an infinite cylinder 2 the cylinder is tested between two flat walls the free ends of the cylinder are directly connected to these two walls so that no fluid can pass between it is found that the simulated 2d drag coefficients are satisfactory the predicted drag coefficients of a 3d circular cylinder at different reynolds number are compared with experimental data of finite 3d circular cylinder with two free ends in wieselsberger 1922 and simulated results in gao et al 2018 the simulated drag coefficients in the present study show much better agreement with experimental data in wieselsberger 1922 than the simulated data in gao et al 2018 this is because the present cylinder is the same one used by wieselsberger 1922 but gao et al 2018 used a different cylinder with the aspect ratio of 1 5 which is much smaller than wieselsberger 1922 it is found that the drag coefficient in the present paper is found to be larger than gao et al 2018 before re reaching 104 however when re is larger than a certain number around 104 the drag coefficient in the present paper gradually becomes smaller than gao et al 2018 with re continuously increasing to a critical number both the 2d cylinder and 3d cylinder in present study experience drag drop at this critical reynolds number but in gao et al 2018 this drag drop cannot be observed and the cd re curve becomes flat the above difference between present study and gao et al 2018 is attributed to the difference of aspect ratio between the cylinders it may be because the 3d cylinder with a smaller aspect ratio will present more significant free end effects on the flow field correspondingly the induced flow characteristics will be very different from a cylinder with larger aspect ratio and an infinite cylinder or a 2d cylinder which has no free ends through further comparisons of drag coefficient of the 3d cylinder and 2d cylinder the drag coefficient of 3d cylinder is found to be generally much smaller than the 2d cylinder therefore every 3d cylinder with different finite length deserves its own investigation instead of being simplified into a 2d cylinder the pressure distribution on the surface of the cylinder is also studied the pressure coefficient on the surface of the cylinder is defined as follows 35 c p p p 0 1 2 ρ u 2 with p the static pressure pa fig 6 shows the comparison of 2d circular cylinder and experiment data by falchsbart in zdravkovich 1997 at re 6 7 105 fig 7 displays the comparison of 3d circular cylinder and experimental data with the aspect ratio l d 1 5 at re 2 55 105 in zdravkovich 1997 both comparisons show good agreement although the simulated pressure coefficient is slightly larger than experiment which is also observed by gomez and richmond 2016 this small difference is because the rans equations use empirical formulations for the reynolds stresses that may not model the wide range of time and length scales presented in the flow 3 4 2 square prism since the mesh and numerical settings are the same with circular cylinder the validation of the circular cylinder above also lays a solid foundation and convincing proof for simulating the square prism the cd re curves for 2d and 3d square prisms are both displayed in fig 8 the predicted drag force coefficients of 2d square prism at re 2 0 104 and re 4 0 104 are 2 33 and 2 48 respectively which are slightly larger than experimental value 2 2 and 2 34 by lyn et al 1995 and nishimura 2001 fig 9 shows the pressure distribution on the surface of the cylinder at re 2 0 104 which agrees well with lee et al 1975 bearman et al 1982 nishimura et al 2000 s experimental results although two concave points can be observed on x 0 5 and 1 5 which are right located at the separation point and the back of the cylinder respectively this difference is induced by k ω sst model itself because it is based on the boussinesq approximation which slightly reduces the accuracy of flow separations the negative pressure value around the second concave point at the back of the cylinder is much larger than experiment which right explains why the simulated drag coefficients are larger than experiment in fig 8 all these agreements indicate that rans simulation can be applied into predicting the drag force and pressure acting on a square prism 3 5 time averaged results to explain the differences between 2d and 3d cylinders by examining the flow field a transient simulation urans is adopted because of its ability of investigating the transient behavior such as streamlines vortex time history of drag coefficient etc based on steady simulations unsteady rans urans simulations are conducted for flow past both square prisms and circular cylinders a transient flow solver pisofoam is used in this section courant number is set to be always less than 1 to ensure the accuracy of the simulations the drag coefficients obtained through urans are compared with experiment and steady rans as shown in table 2 although rans can give good predictions for drag coefficient which has been verified in the above section a generally better agreement with experimental data verified the capability of urans simulations into better solving the problem of the flow past the cylinders as an analytical tool the time averaged results also afford a comparison with other published velocity results on the flow around a square prism in this section the time averaged results are presented including the pressure velocity distributions and streamlines the pressure coefficients velocity and streamlines are averaged based on the full statistical time after solutions getting converged therefore the statistical time used in this study is long enough to give reliable results for the periodic case the time averaged 2d drag coefficients are obtained by averaging 20 cycles of time history data after convergence for the non periodic case the time averaged 3d drag coefficients are obtained by averaging the data during at least 200 non dimensional time units after convergence it has been checked carefully that the differences between the force coefficients based on the full statistical time and the halved statistical time are the same therefore the statistical time used in this study is long enough to give reliable results 3 5 1 surface pressure fig 10 and fig 11 show the time averaged pressure distributions on the surface of the circular cylinder and square prism respectively from the leading edge to the trailing edge in each figure the pressure on the bottom of the 2d cylinder and the center cross section of the 3d cylinders are compared it can be found that the curve trends of 2d cylinder and 3d cylinder are the same but the pressure coefficients around the 2d cylinder are generally much larger than 3d cylinders this is because unlike the absolute constraint on the flow past 2d cylinder in longitudinal direction the 3d cylinder can allow the water to flow along the bottom of cylinder and exit at two free ends which helps to release the impact energy at the center as a result the pressure is much less than 2d cylinder in fig 11 the positive pressure is observed within the majority of the front surface of the square cylinder except for those areas very near the corner this is mainly because the front surface of the square cylinder is perpendicular to the incoming flow as a result the velocity from the streamwise direction will suddenly change to the transverse direction at the front surface of the cylinder and finally the streamwise velocity reduces to almost zero but for a circular cylinder the positive pressure is only covering a limited area ranging approximately 39 from the middle point of the front surface of the 3d cylinder the difference of the pressure distributions between square cylinder and circular cylinder also results in the fact that the drag coefficient of the square prism is larger than the corresponding circular cylinder also the urans simulated pressure distributions are compared with rans simulations and corresponding published experimental data of a 2d square prism it is found that rans and urans simulated results of a 2d square prism show the similar trend but the urans simulated results match the experimental data slightly better 3 5 2 velocity distribution fig 12 shows the side view of the velocity distribution on the surface of the circular cylinder or square prism in fig 12 the comparisons of 2d 3d circular cylinder and 3d square prism are shown in a row the velocity contours are approximately symmetric about the centerline of the cylinder as a critical parameter to describe the starting wake behind the cylinder the recirculation region is defined as the distance from the cylinder center to the stagnation point in present comparisons the recirculation length of the 3d cylinder is much larger compared with present 2d cylinder thus the streamwise velocity recovers much faster in 2d cylinder than 3d cylinder also the 3d circular cylinder recovers much faster than square prism it can be found that the fluctuations of the velocity field caused by the square prism is much larger than the circular cylinder 3 6 instantaneous fluctuations in addition to these time averaged parameters instantaneous parameters that can reflect the unsteady flow characteristics such as instantaneous drag coefficient streamlines can also be obtained through the urans simulations due to the oscillation of the flow hydrodynamic forces including drag become unsteady and start to show periodic or quasi periodic oscillations with time 3 6 1 streamlines vorticity fig 13 shows the side view of instantaneous streamlines past 2d circular cylinder 3d circular cylinder and square prism respectively fig 14 and fig 15 show the bottom and front view of instantaneous streamlines past 3d circular cylinder and square prism respectively compared with 2d cylinder additional vortex and streamlines on the free ends can be captured in 3d cylinders also instead of uniform crossing streamlines in 2d cylinder the streamlines crossing the cylinder vary along the length of the cylinder there are four spiral vortices symmetrical about the mid span of the cylinder which are also observed by gao et al 2018 these observed differences are mainly caused by the presence of the free ends at the finite 3d cylinders by comparing the square prism and circular cylinder the streamlines are almost symmetric about the center of the cylinder but the effective formation length of large scale vortices behind the square prism is larger than circular cylinder as a result the streamlines past the square prism are more turbulent to study the free end effect on the wake of the cylinder the comparison of vorticity between the 2d and 3d circular cylinders are presented in fig 16 in fig 16 a the regular formation of the vortex street can be observed behind the 2d cylinder but in fig 16 b two tip vortices that are separated alternatively from the top side and bottom side of the cylinder extend to the downstream and just form very weak vortex shedding krajnović 2011 also described the similar finding about these two tip vortices from the les simulations it is found that the free ends of the cylinder may have significant effect on suppressing the formation of vortex shedding behind 3 6 2 drag coefficient fig 17 presented the behavior of drag coefficient in time it is clearly seen that the time periodical variation of c d of a 2d cylinder experiences the regular shedding of vortex however the variation of c d of a 3d cylinder shows less regular periodicity and the time histories are more chaotic than a 2d cylinder obviously the variation of vortex structures along the cylinder length the diameter of the cylinder and additional vortex structures at the free ends observed in 3d cylinders referring to figs 14 and 15 should be responsible for the irregularity of c d also the fluctuation amplitudes of c d decrease significantly and low frequency modulations of fluctuation amplitude are observed in 3d cylinder by fft analysis of the time history data of c d for the 3d circular cylinder the low frequency f0 can be obtained as shown in fig 18 the power spectrum shows that f0 is around 3 7hz for the 3d circular cylinder which is much lower than the oscillating frequency of c d for 2d circular cylinder 18 66hz this may be because the presence of two free ends causes suppression of regular vortex shedding as shown by fig 16 also as mentioned in zhang and samtaney 2016 compared with the regular time periodic fluctuation observed in simulation with low aspect ratio this quasiperiodic modulation is also called beat phenomenon which is only noticeable in three dimensional simulations as shown in fig 12 with the stagnation point located further the wake vortices behind the square prism also start to shed further away from the rear surface compared with the circular cylinder and hence the near wake flow field is less affected the unsteady wake has insignificant effect on the drag coefficient which remains at a near constant value consequently c d shows smaller fluctuations in magnitude 4 predicted motions of the circular cylinder and square prism the free falling process of the circular cylinder dropped in lyu et al 2014 s experiments is repeated through the improved dynamic modelling method described in section 2 in section 3 it is found that the urans simulations cost much more calculation time than rans simulations though urans simulations can predict slightly better the drag coefficient than rans simulations for design and operational purposes in ocean engineering the interpolation of rans simulated drag coefficients in figs 5 and 8 are adopted into the improved dynamical model and the following trajectory predictions considering rans good behavior in both accuracy and efficiency in lyu et al 2014 s drop tests the horizontal cylinder is released above the water surface and dropped into water the motions of the cylinder started to be captured through a high speed camera when the cylinder just got immersed into water table 3 shows the property of the dropped cylinder in lyu et al 2014 s dropping experiments the slamming velocity is the vertical body velocity before water entry the velocity components in x y and z direction at t 0 ms are represented by x 0 y 0 z 0 it is noted that t 0 ms is the moment that the cylinder just gets fully immersed into water after water entry according to the experiment in lyu et al 2014 the initial velocity components x 0 y 0 z 0 are determined by both slamming velocity vs and current speed vc because we have two sets of vs and vc vs 0 5 m s vc 0 m s and vs 0 5 m s vc 0 05 m s correspondingly two initial velocity components x 0 y 0 z 0 will be 0 0 0 4755 m s and 0 0 0167 m s 0 4872 m s 4 1 three dimensional effect the predicted cylinder motions using 2d and 3d cylinder drag coefficients are compared with laboratory drop tests of lyu et al 2014 as shown in fig 19 and fig 20 fig 19 shows the comparison of vertical displacement time series from t 0 ms to t 80 ms under calm water with vs 0 5 m s the predicted vertical displacement curve using the drag coefficient of 3d circular cylinder matches the one observed in experiment very well the use of drag coefficient of 2d circular cylinder slows down the falling process compared with the experiment because the 2d drag coefficient is larger than 3d drag coefficient the drag force in z direction vertical will become larger to resist the vertical motion of the cylinder fig 20 shows the comparison of vertical displacement horizontal displacement curves of the circular cylinder with 2d and 3d drag coefficient under current vs 0 5 m s vc 0 05 m s it is found that the y z plane trajectory predicted using 3d drag coefficient agrees much better with experiment than 2d drag coefficient though the horizontal displacement predicted using 3d drag coefficient is a little smaller than the experiment this difference is because the lifting force in horizontal direction caused during freely falling is ignored in fig 19 the vertical displacement predicted by 2d drag coefficient is much smaller than 3d drag coefficient the reason is the same as discussed for fig 9 but unlike the drag force in z direction the force acting on the cylinder in y direction transverse by current will be a pushing force to move the cylinder further away thus the use of 2d drag coefficient will cause a larger y directional displacement than that obtained with 3d drag coefficient as shown in fig 20 4 2 the effect of cylinder shape the effect of the cylinder shape on the motion of falling cylinder is investigated by studying two different cylinders a circular cylinder and square prism respectively the vertical displacement time curves of the circular and square cylinders under calm water are compared in fig 21 it can be observed that the vertical displacement of the circular cylinder is much larger than the square cylinder because the drag coefficient of circular cylinder is less than the square prism the circular cylinder suffers less drag force during falling process with the slamming velocity increasing the difference of the vertical displacement between circular cylinder and square prism increases fig 22 shows the comparison of y z plane trajectory of the circular cylinder under current z 0 1 m s vc 1 m s 5 m s it is found that the circular cylinder moves more in the vertical direction but less in the transverse direction this is because the circular cylinder experiences less drag force in vertical direction to stop the cylinder falling and less lateral force to move the cylinder away in transverse direction compared with the square cylinder in the above case studies the three dimensional effect and cylinder shape effect both significantly influence the trajectory of the falling cylinder the improved dynamic modelling method can consider both effects by using a more accurate drag coefficient from cfd predictions due to a lager drag coefficient 5 conclusions in the present paper a dynamic modelling approach improved by cfd is proposed to study the underwater motion of the dropped cylinder the relation between the drag coefficient of the circular and square cylinder and reynolds number has been obtained by using rans simulations in openfoam and validated by comparing with past research results the urans simulations are applied for different cylinders including 2d and 3d circular cylinder and 3d square cylinder to determine the difference of their flow fluctuations including instantaneous drag coefficient streamlines and time averaged velocity and pressure distributions through through rans and urans simulation results it is found that compared with 2d cylinder the drag coefficient of 3d cylinder becomes much smaller the variation of drag coefficient with time shows less regular periodicity the fluctuation amplitudes of c d decrease significantly and low frequency modulations are observed because the free ends are found to suppress the regular vortex shedding additional vortex can be observed at the two free ends of 3d cylinder the variation of vortex along the length of the cylinder is captured the square prism will make the flow more turbulent than circular cylinder the phenomena of velocity fluctuation the vortex shedding in the flow domain and flow separations at the square prism are all more apparent at last the accuracy of the dynamic modelling approach to predict the motions of the dropped circular cylinder under calm water and current are both improved by using cfd predicted 3d drag coefficient also the improved dynamical modelling method is extended to predict the motion of another cylinder shape square prism it is found that the displacement of square prism is much smaller in vertical direction but larger in transverse direction compared with circular cylinder credit authorship contribution statement gong xiang methodology software formal analysis writing original draft visualization c guedes soares
