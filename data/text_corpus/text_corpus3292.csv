16460,nitrate pollution is a critical environmental issue in need of urgent addressing electrochemical reduction is an attractive strategy for treating nitrate due to the environmental friendliness however it is still a challenge to achieve the simultaneous high activity and selectivity here we report the design of a porous tubular carbon membrane as the electrode deposited with catalysts which provides a large triple phase boundary area for nitrate removal reactions the achieved nitrate removal rate is one order of magnitude higher than other literatures with high nitrate conversion and high selectivity of nitrogen the carbon membrane itself had a limited catalytic property thus cu pd bimetal catalysts were deposited inside the nano pores to enhance the activity and selectivity when na2so4 electrolyte was applied the achieved single pass removal of nitrate was increased from 55 15 for blank membrane to 97 12 by adding catalysts inside the membrane in case of naoh as the electrolyte the single pass nitrate removal efficiency selectivity to nitrogen formation and nitrate removal rate was 90 66 96 40 and 1 47 10 3 mmol min 1 cm 2 respectively density functional theory studies demonstrate that the loading of bimetal catalysts compared with single metal catalysts enhances the adsorption of no3 on membrane surface favorable for n2 formation than nh3 on cu pd surface the application of catalytic carbon membrane nano reactors can open new windows for nitrate removal due to the high reactor efficiency graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrochemical reduction nitrate carbon membrane nano reactor bimetal catalysts 1 introduction electrochemical reduction has attracted a great deal attention in the field of nitrate removal due to the environmental friendliness and ease operation in recent years research efforts are intensified to develop active electrode and highly efficient reactor one challenge for electrochemical reduction is to obtain simultaneous high activity and selectivity extensive researches have been done to improve activity and selectivity of electrode by selection and optimization of catalytic components the catalysts include metal oxides and metals single or bimetal the main metal oxide catalysts showed strong catalytic reduction activity su et al 2017 reported their study using co3o4 or fe3o4 supported on ti cathode for nitrate electrochemical reduction with nitrate removal and total nitrogen tn removal reaching 99 and 65 respectively kim and pak 2019 obtained 97 8 nitrate removal with the rate constant of 0 0391 mg l 1 min 1 using tio2 ti cathode many researches have been performed on single metals such as rh pt yang et al 2014 cu wang et al 2020 al ni fe li et al 2016 ti li et al 2009 and sn dortsiou et al 2013 it is noteworthy that the noble single metals like pt perform poorly in neutral media duca et al 2015 and the non noble metals like cu are unstable due to the passivation or dissolution hasnat et al 2015 however the bimetal catalysts exhibit superior catalytic activities over single metal catalysts for nitrate electrocatalysis in the bimetal system the promoter metal like cu sn ag in and ni can provide sites for the transformations of no3 and no2 and the noble metal i e pd pt and rh further reduces no2 to n2 and nh4 chen et al 2018 according to previous bimetallic catalytic studies the cu pd system provides the highest activity fan et al 2017 adopted cu pd alloy for nitrate electroreduction with the nitrate conversion of 28 7 and the selectivity of 74 for nitrogen formation a better result nitrogen selectivity of 80 37 and conversion of 100 was achieved by zhang et al 2016 who applied pd cu γal2o3 catalysts into the cathode cell su et al 2016 showed that cu pd supported on stainless steel could yield nitrate conversion of 100 and nitrogen selectivity of 43 although bimetal catalysts showed high activity or high selectivity during nitrate removal it remains challenging to develop a catalyst simultaneously owning high activity and high selectivity besides the factor of electrode the type of the reactor plays important roles as well to date two types of the electrochemical reactors flow by and flow through are frequently studied flow by reactors are designed based on flat and dense electrodes and water flow direction parallel to electrode surface however the reactor efficiency using dense electrodes is undesirable because of the limited surface area offering a low density of electrocatalytic activity sites to overcome this disadvantage porous electrodes including carbon cloth peel et al 2003 carbon fiber couto et al 2016 and granular activated carbon reactor chen et al 2018 are prepared and applied in flow by mode to improve their surface area for high electrocatalytic activity chen et al 2018 reported cu pd catalysts encapsulated in n doped porous carbon with three dimensional coralline structures owning high nitrate removal 95 and high nitrogen selectivity 80 however the reactor efficiency is limited by the nitrate diffusion in out the pores reactive electrochemical membranes rems with nanosized porous structure were also designed for nitrate removal the rems deposited by cu pd catalysts loaded on magneli phase tio2 showed low energy consumption ec 0 12 kwh mol 1 for 100 mm no3 67 of nitrate conversion low selectivities of no2 0 4 and nh4 1 5 gayen et al 2018 with the major products of n2 and n2o in the selectivities of 56 and 43 respectively despite the desirable harmless product of nitrogen nitrate reduction is a complex reaction process producing a variety of intermediates or other final products including no2 no2 no n2o nh2oh nh2nh2 h2n2o3 hno or its dimmer h2n2o2 h2no nh2no2 nh3 and nh4 dortsiou and kyriacou 2009 martínez et al 2017 the high selectivity of nitrogen depends on auto reduction or assist reduction additives i e cl the auto reduction mainly includes electron transfer and hydrogen reduction processes in terms of nitrate reduction mediated by electron transfer the nitrate adsorbs on the electrode surface followed by reduction to nitrite the rate determining step wang et al 2021 then the nitrite is reduced to no which determines the final product nh4 or n2 in addition the metal catalysts like fe or cu donate electrons and promote nitrate reduction jonoush et al 2020 shih et al 2020 moreover the nitrate reduction can also be mediated by the adsorbed atomic hydrogen h ads generated by the reduction of water via the volmer process gennero de chialvo and chialvo 1998 the presence of h ads can be favorable to the formation of n h bond leading to the formation of nh4 gao et al 2020 hydrogen can assist nitrate reduction to nitrogen because the hydrogen broke the n o bond to form the nitrogen teng et al 2018 however this method cannot reduce nitrate to nitrogen completely with the limited selectivity less than 60 in common reactor and the additive oxidant is necessary during the electrochemical process the conversion of no3 to nh4 occurred on the cathode surface and cl ions could be oxidized on the anode to form cl2 then a chemical reaction occurred between cl2 and water to give clo which could effectively oxidize nh4 to n2 duan et al 2019 however the addition of nacl can produce cl2 which cause secondary pollution thus a novel method without additive but still to obtain high nitrate conversion and high nitrogen selectivity is essential in the fields of electrochemical reduction of nitrate in addition to the requirement of high selective catalyst process conditions need to be optimized to allow efficient electrochemical reduction in this work a porous cathode material made by a carbon membrane cm with supported cu pd catalysts was developed as the catalytic carbon membrane nano reactor c cmnr for efficient electrochemical nitrate reduction with high conversion and nitrogen selectivity without adding any additives the tubular carbon membrane is prepared by extrusion and carbonization from phenol resin the material fabrication and setting up of reactor are facile to scale up the characteristics of cathode materials and electrocatalytic capability were carefully studied the application of tubular porous cm with cu pd catalysts and flow through operation ensures the efficient electrochemical processes at large triple phase boundary tpb area pollutants nitrate electronic conducting phase cm and cu pd catalysts pure water nitrogen for further understanding of the reaction pathways in this process density functional theory dft studies were conducted to investigate the adsorption energy of different intermediates 2 material and methods 2 1 electrode preparation the hexamethylenetetramine hmta 99 5 innochem co

three electrodes in 0 5 m na2so4 or naoh electrolyte with or without nitrate concentrations of 50 mm the flat pt was used as counter electrode at least 99 9 purity a sce at neutral media or hg hgo electrode at alkaline media was chosen as the reference electrode joining the cell by a luggin capillary the cm with cu pd catalyst cm cu pd as the electrode area of 5 cm2 was used as the working

used to describe the electron core interactions with a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 ev according to tem and xrd results of bimetal catalysts brillouin zones were sampled with a grid of 1 1 1 gamma special k point for the 3 23 1 cupd 111 surface supercells a vacuum layer of 15 å in vertical direction to model slab was set to avoid the lateral interactions between layer and its images the top three layers could fully relax while the bottom two layers were fixed the geometry optimization was stopped when the forces on all unconstrained atoms were less than 0 02 ev å the adsorption energy ea was defined as zhang et al 2019 1 e a e t o t a l e s l a b e m o l e c u l e where emolecule eslab and etotal are the energy of metal cluster support and metal cluster support system respectively the corresponding clean slab system clean cupd 111 surface and the total energies of the adsorbed system respectively according to the method presented by nørskov and co workers the gibbs free energy profiles were estimated under zero potential u 0 by the equation chen et al 2020 2 δ g δ e a δ z p e t δ s where δea is the energy change between the reactant and product obtained from dft calculations zpe is the change of zero point energy and t 300 k and s denote the temperature and change of entropy respectively 3 results 3 1 physical properties of the tubular carbon membrane the cm 8 is an asymmetric membrane with 8 3 nm of pore size and 30 μm of thickness of the top layer fig s2a and the surface of top layer is relatively dense fig s2b qin et al 2015 in order to improve the electrocatalytic activity of cm we loaded bimetal catalysts cu and pd on cm 8 by electrodeposition all electrodes were deposited in baths containing x mm pd no3 2 and 10 x mm cu no3 2 and the 700 mv vs sce was selected as the deposition potential zhang et al 2014 the sem images are shown in the fig 2 the morphologies of different catalysts depend on the mole ratios of cu and pd of the electrolyte the pure cu cu2 10 mm fig 2a and cu8pd2 cu2 8 mm pd2 2 mm fig 2b catalysts are in irregular particulates with increasing ratio of pd cu from 0 to 6 4 the particles show the morphology in spherical shape fig 2a d but the size of particles varies while the pure pd pd2 10 mm and cu2pd8 cu2 2 mm pd2 8 mm particles appear to be needlelike structure fig 2e and f the chemical composition determined by edx and xps is given in table s1 the compositions of membrane surface provided by edx are consistent with the mole ratios of cu no3 2 and pd no3 2 in electrolyte and the content of pd loaded on cm varies from 24 to 89 table s1 it is thus indicated that cu pd catalysts were successfully prepared by coelectrodeposition over a wide range of compositions we tested the lsv curves of electrodes prepared under different electrodeposition conditions including coelectrodeposition time number of coelectrodeposition times and cu pd molar ratio fig 3 there is no obvious redox peak appeared in the lsv curves due to the electrochemical characteristics of carbon materials peel et al 2003 fig 3a and b therefore the abrupt increasing of current density can be attributed to nitrate reduction ghodbane et al 2008 a relatively high catalytic current density was received when cu pd was deposited three times with deposition time of 20 minutes fig 3a and b fig 3c shows the curve of time current with different deposition times there is an obvious serrated border in curves which is the typical deposit characteristics of porous materials with the increase of deposition times the current density of electrodes increases slightly indicating that more deposition times can increase the conductivity of electrodes fig 3d displays that the cu pd molar ration of 5 5 obtained high current density therefore the great electrodeposition conditions are the deposition three times 20 minutes of deposition time and cu pd molar ration of 5 5 fig 4 a shows the tem results of the cu5 pd5 catalysts the bimetal catalysts pd and cu dispersed well in cm the lattice fringes detected are attributed to cu pd alloys 111 facet 0 214 nm pdf 04 003 5221 chen et al 2018 and the obvious characteristic of metal catalysts by electrodeposition fig 4b the tem results of the cu5 pd5 catalysts after electrocatalysis process were shown in fig 4c and d and the lattice fringes have not changed the edx line scans on cross section are provided in the fig s3 indicating that bimetal catalysts can be deposited inside the pores enhancing the electrocatalytic activity xps spectra and xrd patterns are shown in the fig 5 the atom ratio of cu and pd the surface of cm cu5 pd5 is about 1 which coincides with the feeding mole ratio it can be seen from fig 5a the original cm mainly consists of c c bonds and c o bonds and the content of c c bonds is higher than c o bonds fig 5b displays the c1s of the cm cu5 pd5 obviously the content of c o bonds increased and new bonds c o appeared the c o bonds appearing on the cm surface provide more nucleation sites for bimetal which facilitates the high dispersion of bimetal particles and results in enhanced electrocatalysis ability for nitrate in addition these bonds could provide a stable electronic contact accelerating the electron transfer ability between cm and bimetal catalysis layer the emission peak for pd 3d of the cm cu5 pd5 at 340 6 pd 3d3 2 335 34 pd 3d5 2 341 38 pd 3d3 2 and 336 09 ev pd 3d5 2 can be fitted to the pd0 and pd2 species zhang et al 2014 fig 5c and the existence of pd2 indicating that the surface of pd is easily oxidated at room temperature ohashi et al 2010 as shown in fig 5d the two peaks for cu0 appear at 932 06 cu 2p3 2 and 951 75 ev cu 2p1 2 while the peak at 933 61 cu 2p3 2 953 59 cu 2p1 2 943 08 cu 2p3 2 and 962 38 ev cu 2p1 2 are fitted to cu2 zhang et al 2014 the ratio of cu0 and pd for the cm cu5 pd5 are 39 34 and 41 71 therefore we can conclude that the coelectrodeposition method is suitable for electrodepositing bimetal of cu and pd on cm the comparison of chemical structure of cm cu5 pd5 described by xps before and after electrochemical reduction were shown in the fig s4 there was no change according to the lmm auger spectra indicating that the catalyst is stable in the catalysis but peak of na 1s was appeared appearing of na 1s should be related with the residue of the supporting electrolyte fig 5e displays xrd patterns of different electrodes prepared by coelectrodeposition the peaks of all electrodes at 2θ 23 65 show the amorphous carbon nature of cm the peak of cm pd10 locates at approximately 2θ 40 39 and this peak become smooth and weak with the copper content increasing because of less pd content and the change of crystallinity the xrd pattern of cm cu5 pd5 shows one obvious diffraction peaks at around 41 4 which can be assigned to the 111 lattice planes of the face centered cubic fcc phase of cu pd alloy pdf 04 003 5221 chen et al 2018 besides the peak of cm cu10 is relatively weak suggesting that the cu has poor crystallinity neither pure pd nor pure cu diffraction peaks were shown in the bimetallic cm cu pd instead a single peak 2θ 41 75 appeared indicating that mono phased cu pd was produced during the coelectrodeposition process allemand et al 2011 3 2 nitrate electrochemical reduction the influence of pore size of cm on nitrate removal is shown in fig 6 and the pore size and pure water flux were displayed in the table s2 the single pass removal of nitrate of cm 8 55 15 is higher than cm 660 36 31 and cm 430 33 44 fig 6a indicating that the single pass removal of nitrate is improved with their pore size smaller when the pore size increased from 8 3 nm to 660 nm and the sn2 decreased from 47 00 to 39 50 table 1 with pore size increasing the permeate flux is increased leading to enhance ce and nitrate removal rate fig 6b d hydraulic retention time has a significant effect on the single pass removal of nitrate higher single pass removal of nitrate 55 15 was obtained when the hrt was 502 s fig 6e however the permeate flux with hrt of 120 s is twice as high as the permeate flux with hrt of 502 s fig 6f leading to the high ce fig 6g the nitrate removal rate is 5 40 10 4 mmol min 1 cm 2 when the hrt is 502 s lower than that of 120 s 9 06 10 4 mmol min 1 cm 2 fig 6h the effects of potential on nitrate removal were shown in table s3 and the nitrate removal and ce were poor in low potential 4 v vs sce thus 4 v vs sce was applied for nitrate electrochemical reduction the single pass removal of nitrate was enhanced after loading bimetal catalysts increasing from 55 15 to 97 92 in na2so4 electrolyte fig 7 a loading catalysts limited the permeate flux and obtained low ce fig 7b and c the nitrate removal rate eq s8 was reasonably used to evaluate the electrode electrocatalytic activity and reactor efficiency the nitrate removal rate increased from 5 40 10 4 to 1 01 10 3 mmol min 1 cm 2 by means of loading bimetal catalysts fig 7d correspondingly the single pass removal and removal rate was improved greatly because of the effect of bimetal catalysts the comparison of selectivity of products ce ec and electrical energy per order metric eeo before and after loading bimetal catalysts are shown in the table 1 besides increasing the conversion of nitrate and selectivity of n2 ec was decreased from 4 58 to 3 13 kwh mol 1 electrolyte also has important influence on nitrate removal the single pass removal of nitrate using cm cu5 pd5 with the electrolyte of na2so4 97 92 is higher than naoh electrolyte 90 60 fig 7a however naoh electrolyte is favorable to high nitrogen selectivity 96 40 the ce and nitrate removal rate were enhanced after loading bimetal catalysts increasing from 18 05 to 40 55 and 1 01 10 3 to 1 47 10 3 mmol min 1 cm 2 respectively because the permeate flux was enhanced in naoh electrolyte fig 7b and c the corresponding ec was decreased from 4 58 to 2 59 kwh mol 1 table 1 there is no n2o detected in the gas sample indicating that n2 is the main gas product in this reactor c cmnr using cm cu5 pd5 showed high reactor efficiency the comparison of nitrate removal between our work and other literature summarized in table 2 the c cmnr with cm cu5 pd5 adopted in the naoh electrolyte exhibited excellent nitrate removal rate 1 47 10 3 mmol min 1 cm 2 and high selectivity of n2 96 40 the nitrate removal rate can be one order of magnitude higher than literature abdallah et al 2014 couto et al 2016 dortsiou and kyriacou 2009 gayen et al 2018 ghodbane et al 2008 reyter et al 2009 katsounaros et al 2006 peel et al 2003 su et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of membrane pore size and hrt on the single pass removal of nitrate to shed light on the effects of the pore size of the membrane and hrt on the nitrate removal fig 8 a schematically shows a single nanochannel in cm 8 a single nitrate ion enters a pore in the membrane at the point a then its movement combines a brownian motion and an axial movement with the water driven by the trans membrane pressure gradience the ion will collide with the pore wall at b when the radial movement distance is larger than the pore radius r if this collision does not lead to an effective reaction the ion will reflect and collide with the opposite wall at c after another vertical moving distance larger than the diameter of the pore if the collision is effective the nitrate ions would be catalyzed to products such as n2 nh4 and no2 when the nitrate ions collide with the pore wall the probability of the nitrate ion being catalyzed can be enhanced with increasing of collision number and then the single pass removal of nitrate will be improved d is the sum of the radial component of the brownian motion distance and d can be calculated by eq 3 feynman et al 1989 3 d 2 6 kt h r t μ where the k is boltzmann s constant t is the room temperature k μ is the viscosity according to the eq 3 d is proportional to hrt the longer d would be caused by the longer hrt resulting in a higher probability of d r therefore the higher single pass removal of nitrate would be obtained with hrt increasing additionally hrt can be calculated by eq 4 4 h r t π r 2 l q l where l is thickness of membrane m r is the radius of the pore m ql is the volume flow m3 h 1 in a single pore the total flow of water through the membrane is the sum of ql kozeny constructed rock capillary model christian et al 2012 and the ql can be calculated by the eq 5 5 q l 9 π r 4 δ p 20 μ l where the δp is trans membrane pressure pa during ion going through the pore the collision number f can be calculated with d and r using eq 6 6 f d r 1 2 r the relationship between the d and r is closely related with the single pass removal of nitrate the smaller r would receive the higher f when d is a constant value additionally if r is a constant value f depends on d and d is proportional to hrt the higher f is caused by the longer hrt therefore decreasing pore size and increasing hrt can improve collision number resulting in higher single pass removal of nitrate concerning eqs 4 6 eq 6 can be displayed as the eq 7 7 f 1 2 30 3 r 2 k t δ p l the f is proportional to the l indicating that higher thickness of membrane would receive the higher collision number however the thinner membranes are what we desired because it can decrease trans membrane resistance in membrane filter process resulting in high permeate flux of membrane f is inversely proportional to r2 therefore decreasing pore size can effectively increase the collision number the collision number increases exponentially with the decreasing of pore size fig 8b 4 2 the mechanism of nitrate electrochemical reduction in c cmnr c cmnr with cm cu5 pd5 shows a high single pass removal of nitrate and high selectivity to the formation of n2 the schematic diagram of electrochemical reduction of nitrate in c cmnr is shown in the fig 9 due to the catalytic active sites on the pore walls the dissolved nitrate orange ball will be electrochemically reduced when the nitrate ion collides with the pore wall the nanopores provide a place in which the nitrate solution gets a high ratio of surface interface molecule amount to bulk molecule amount without contact with the active sites the probability of the nitrate ion colliding with the pore walls will be enhanced resulting in an improvement of the single pass removal of nitrate this reactor is easy to build and scale up with moderating work condition fast removal rate and free of additional chemical regents 4 3 the effects of catalysts and electrolyte on nitrate removal the electric field combining trans membrane pressure supplies an additional increase of the permeate flux leading to low energy consumption bhattacharyya and bera 2013 the small pore size can enhance permeate flux because it influences the structure of electric double layer increasing electroosmosis phenomenon the electroosmosis phenomenon provided by membrane with nanopores are more obvious than that with larger pore membranes because the stern layer and diffusion layer form the charged nanochannel with electric field the surplus ions in diffusion layer experience columbic force and moving to electrode which in turn result in electroosmosis flow the electroosmosis flow strongly depends on surface charge density and ζ potential bhattacharyya and bera 2015 which is affected by many factors such as porosity pore size of electrodes and ion concentration of electrolyte when the pore size of membrane decreased the interaction between ions and pores wall increases and the structure of electric double layer changes in nanochannel in addition the electrolyte influences the permeate flux because the current in naoh is higher than that in the na2so4 fig s5 shows that the cathode current in naoh is higher than that in na2so4 and the peak current of the cm cu5 pd5 electrode in naoh is more positive than that in na2so4 thus the electroosmosis phenomenon is more obvious in the electrolyte of naoh leading to high permeate flux the nitrate removal also relies on the electrolyte conditions ph and anions in the solution de vooys et al 2000 at different electrolyte circumstances there are different absorbed species covered on the electrode surface such as hydrogen species at low ph values and hydroxide or even oxide species at high ph values meanwhile different electrodes also influence the absorbed species the single pass removal of nitrate with the electrolyte of na2so4 is higher than naoh electrolyte as shown in fig 7 because most hydroxide species could be absorbed on the active sites of cathode unfavorably inhibiting the adsorption of nitrate de vooys et al 2000 martínez et al 2017 the selectivity of n2 in naoh electrolyte reaching 96 40 is triple to that in na2so4 electrolyte as naoh can neutralize the excess h produced from hydrogen evolution reaction inhibiting the formation of n h bonds and accelerating the formation of n n bonds martínez et al 2017 the isoelectric point pi of cathode materials also influences the selectivity of products carbon materials have a pi of 6 3 when the ph is 12 carbon materials present negative superficial charge producing positive counter ion layer i e h3o nh4 in equilibrium the ammonia present in this layer could prevent the lion of more ammonia this excess positive charge leads to the formation of n2 as a final product instead of ammonia marchesini et al 2012 therefore carbon materials used as the cathodes on naoh electrolyte can produce more n2 in the process of electrochemical reduction process ghodbane et al 2008 4 4 the mechanism of no3 removal to illustrate the effects of bimetal catalysts on the various possible reaction pathways we further carried out first principle calculation to obtain gibbs free energy diagrams different coverage of no3 predosed at the surface of cupd 111 were considered in order to identify optimal adsorption sites huai et al 2015 the no3 prefers bridge adsorption on pd sites fig 10 and the calculated average adsorption energies of no3 on cupd 111 surface are 1 76 ev however the average adsorption energies of no3 on pure pd 111 pure cu 111 and carbon support is about 1 34 1 65 and 0 13 ev respectively which indicate that the no3 is more easily adsorbed on the cupd 111 surface and the existence of cu can enhance the adsorption of no3 two pathways related to the formation of nh3 and n2 were compared according to free energy fig 10 the no3 can be catalyzed to no2 which can be further reduced to nh3 no or n2 on pd sites fig 11 clearly exhibits the free energy of the n2 and nh3 is 8 22 and 1 46 ev respectively suggesting that this process of nh3 formation is a nonspontaneous process therefore the n2 will be the main product on the cm cu pd surface which is in accordance with the experimental results the adsorption energy of no3 on the cupd 111 is 1 76 ev higher than that on the pd 111 1 34 ev cu 111 1 65 ev and carbon support 0 13 ev according to the table 3 the free energy of n2 on pd 111 cu 111 and carbon support is higher than that on cupd 111 indicating that nitrogen generation is much easier generate on cupd 111 pd 111 carbon support cu 111 and the metal pd can enhance the electrocatalysis ability of no3 to n2 according to above experiment result and dft analysis the reaction scheme can be explored initially the no3 was adsorbed on the electrode surface to form no3 ads eq 8 which was decomposed into no2 in general no2 ads was decomposed into no ads zhang et al 2021 however the adsorption energy of no on cm cu pd is greater than zero table 3 indicating that the adsorption process of no on electrode surface is endothermic and the no is not easily produced on the surface of cm cu pd electrode due to applied negative potential 4 v vs sce most adsorbed h atom produces gaseous hydrogen additionally the electrode surface is hydrophobic evidenced by the contact angle 100 8 of top layer fig s6 resulting in h2 desorption in electrode surface kuang et al 2018 thus the produced h2 can function as the reducing reagent to reduce no3 to n2 as displayed in eqs 8 12 jonoush et al 2020 on the other hand the h2 and h2o were also adsorbed on the electrode surface due to the low hydrogen dissociation energy of pd atom h2 can be dissociated to h atom on the pd sites and further adsorbed on the pd sites firstly until saturation then no3 start to adsorb on the cu site and the populated h atom can promote no3 reducing to n2 according as shown in eqs 13 18 shih et al 2020 the above hypothesis helps to explain that nitrogen is the main product during the cm cu pd electrode reactions 8 no3 no3 ads

16460,nitrate pollution is a critical environmental issue in need of urgent addressing electrochemical reduction is an attractive strategy for treating nitrate due to the environmental friendliness however it is still a challenge to achieve the simultaneous high activity and selectivity here we report the design of a porous tubular carbon membrane as the electrode deposited with catalysts which provides a large triple phase boundary area for nitrate removal reactions the achieved nitrate removal rate is one order of magnitude higher than other literatures with high nitrate conversion and high selectivity of nitrogen the carbon membrane itself had a limited catalytic property thus cu pd bimetal catalysts were deposited inside the nano pores to enhance the activity and selectivity when na2so4 electrolyte was applied the achieved single pass removal of nitrate was increased from 55 15 for blank membrane to 97 12 by adding catalysts inside the membrane in case of naoh as the electrolyte the single pass nitrate removal efficiency selectivity to nitrogen formation and nitrate removal rate was 90 66 96 40 and 1 47 10 3 mmol min 1 cm 2 respectively density functional theory studies demonstrate that the loading of bimetal catalysts compared with single metal catalysts enhances the adsorption of no3 on membrane surface favorable for n2 formation than nh3 on cu pd surface the application of catalytic carbon membrane nano reactors can open new windows for nitrate removal due to the high reactor efficiency graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrochemical reduction nitrate carbon membrane nano reactor bimetal catalysts 1 introduction electrochemical reduction has attracted a great deal attention in the field of nitrate removal due to the environmental friendliness and ease operation in recent years research efforts are intensified to develop active electrode and highly efficient reactor one challenge for electrochemical reduction is to obtain simultaneous high activity and selectivity extensive researches have been done to improve activity and selectivity of electrode by selection and optimization of catalytic components the catalysts include metal oxides and metals single or bimetal the main metal oxide catalysts showed strong catalytic reduction activity su et al 2017 reported their study using co3o4 or fe3o4 supported on ti cathode for nitrate electrochemical reduction with nitrate removal and total nitrogen tn removal reaching 99 and 65 respectively kim and pak 2019 obtained 97 8 nitrate removal with the rate constant of 0 0391 mg l 1 min 1 using tio2 ti cathode many researches have been performed on single metals such as rh pt yang et al 2014 cu wang et al 2020 al ni fe li et al 2016 ti li et al 2009 and sn dortsiou et al 2013 it is noteworthy that the noble single metals like pt perform poorly in neutral media duca et al 2015 and the non noble metals like cu are unstable due to the passivation or dissolution hasnat et al 2015 however the bimetal catalysts exhibit superior catalytic activities over single metal catalysts for nitrate electrocatalysis in the bimetal system the promoter metal like cu sn ag in and ni can provide sites for the transformations of no3 and no2 and the noble metal i e pd pt and rh further reduces no2 to n2 and nh4 chen et al 2018 according to previous bimetallic catalytic studies the cu pd system provides the highest activity fan et al 2017 adopted cu pd alloy for nitrate electroreduction with the nitrate conversion of 28 7 and the selectivity of 74 for nitrogen formation a better result nitrogen selectivity of 80 37 and conversion of 100 was achieved by zhang et al 2016 who applied pd cu γal2o3 catalysts into the cathode cell su et al 2016 showed that cu pd supported on stainless steel could yield nitrate conversion of 100 and nitrogen selectivity of 43 although bimetal catalysts showed high activity or high selectivity during nitrate removal it remains challenging to develop a catalyst simultaneously owning high activity and high selectivity besides the factor of electrode the type of the reactor plays important roles as well to date two types of the electrochemical reactors flow by and flow through are frequently studied flow by reactors are designed based on flat and dense electrodes and water flow direction parallel to electrode surface however the reactor efficiency using dense electrodes is undesirable because of the limited surface area offering a low density of electrocatalytic activity sites to overcome this disadvantage porous electrodes including carbon cloth peel et al 2003 carbon fiber couto et al 2016 and granular activated carbon reactor chen et al 2018 are prepared and applied in flow by mode to improve their surface area for high electrocatalytic activity chen et al 2018 reported cu pd catalysts encapsulated in n doped porous carbon with three dimensional coralline structures owning high nitrate removal 95 and high nitrogen selectivity 80 however the reactor efficiency is limited by the nitrate diffusion in out the pores reactive electrochemical membranes rems with nanosized porous structure were also designed for nitrate removal the rems deposited by cu pd catalysts loaded on magneli phase tio2 showed low energy consumption ec 0 12 kwh mol 1 for 100 mm no3 67 of nitrate conversion low selectivities of no2 0 4 and nh4 1 5 gayen et al 2018 with the major products of n2 and n2o in the selectivities of 56 and 43 respectively despite the desirable harmless product of nitrogen nitrate reduction is a complex reaction process producing a variety of intermediates or other final products including no2 no2 no n2o nh2oh nh2nh2 h2n2o3 hno or its dimmer h2n2o2 h2no nh2no2 nh3 and nh4 dortsiou and kyriacou 2009 martínez et al 2017 the high selectivity of nitrogen depends on auto reduction or assist reduction additives i e cl the auto reduction mainly includes electron transfer and hydrogen reduction processes in terms of nitrate reduction mediated by electron transfer the nitrate adsorbs on the electrode surface followed by reduction to nitrite the rate determining step wang et al 2021 then the nitrite is reduced to no which determines the final product nh4 or n2 in addition the metal catalysts like fe or cu donate electrons and promote nitrate reduction jonoush et al 2020 shih et al 2020 moreover the nitrate reduction can also be mediated by the adsorbed atomic hydrogen h ads generated by the reduction of water via the volmer process gennero de chialvo and chialvo 1998 the presence of h ads can be favorable to the formation of n h bond leading to the formation of nh4 gao et al 2020 hydrogen can assist nitrate reduction to nitrogen because the hydrogen broke the n o bond to form the nitrogen teng et al 2018 however this method cannot reduce nitrate to nitrogen completely with the limited selectivity less than 60 in common reactor and the additive oxidant is necessary during the electrochemical process the conversion of no3 to nh4 occurred on the cathode surface and cl ions could be oxidized on the anode to form cl2 then a chemical reaction occurred between cl2 and water to give clo which could effectively oxidize nh4 to n2 duan et al 2019 however the addition of nacl can produce cl2 which cause secondary pollution thus a novel method without additive but still to obtain high nitrate conversion and high nitrogen selectivity is essential in the fields of electrochemical reduction of nitrate in addition to the requirement of high selective catalyst process conditions need to be optimized to allow efficient electrochemical reduction in this work a porous cathode material made by a carbon membrane cm with supported cu pd catalysts was developed as the catalytic carbon membrane nano reactor c cmnr for efficient electrochemical nitrate reduction with high conversion and nitrogen selectivity without adding any additives the tubular carbon membrane is prepared by extrusion and carbonization from phenol resin the material fabrication and setting up of reactor are facile to scale up the characteristics of cathode materials and electrocatalytic capability were carefully studied the application of tubular porous cm with cu pd catalysts and flow through operation ensures the efficient electrochemical processes at large triple phase boundary tpb area pollutants nitrate electronic conducting phase cm and cu pd catalysts pure water nitrogen for further understanding of the reaction pathways in this process density functional theory dft studies were conducted to investigate the adsorption energy of different intermediates 2 material and methods 2 1 electrode preparation the hexamethylenetetramine hmta 99 5 innochem co

used to describe the electron core interactions with a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 ev according to tem and xrd results of bimetal catalysts brillouin zones were sampled with a grid of 1 1 1 gamma special k point for the 3 23 1 cupd 111 surface supercells a vacuum layer of 15 å in vertical direction to model slab was set to avoid the lateral interactions between layer and its images the top three layers could fully relax while the bottom two layers were fixed the geometry optimization was stopped when the forces on all unconstrained atoms were less than 0 02 ev å the adsorption energy ea was defined as zhang et al 2019 1 e a e t o t a l e s l a b e m o l e c u l e where emolecule eslab and etotal are the energy of metal cluster support and metal cluster support system respectively the corresponding clean slab system clean cupd 111 surface and the total energies of the adsorbed system respectively according to the method presented by nørskov and co workers the gibbs free energy profiles were estimated under zero potential u 0 by the equation chen et al 2020 2 δ g δ e a δ z p e t δ s where δea is the energy change between the reactant and product obtained from dft calculations zpe is the change of zero point energy and t 300 k and s denote the temperature and change of entropy respectively 3 results 3 1 physical properties of the tubular carbon membrane the cm 8 is an asymmetric membrane with 8 3 nm of pore size and 30 μm of thickness of the top layer fig s2a and the surface of top layer is relatively dense fig s2b qin et al 2015 in order to improve the electrocatalytic activity of cm we loaded bimetal catalysts cu and pd on cm 8 by electrodeposition all electrodes were deposited in baths containing x mm pd no3 2 and 10 x mm cu no3 2 and the 700 mv vs sce was selected as the deposition potential zhang et al 2014 the sem images are shown in the fig 2 the morphologies of different catalysts depend on the mole ratios of cu and pd of the electrolyte the pure cu cu2 10 mm fig 2a and cu8pd2 cu2 8 mm pd2 2 mm fig 2b catalysts are in irregular particulates with increasing ratio of pd cu from 0 to 6 4 the particles show the morphology in spherical shape fig 2a d but the size of particles varies while the pure pd pd2 10 mm and cu2pd8 cu2 2 mm pd2 8 mm particles appear to be needlelike structure fig 2e and f the chemical composition determined by edx and xps is given in table s1 the compositions of membrane surface provided by edx are consistent with the mole ratios of cu no3 2 and pd no3 2 in electrolyte and the content of pd loaded on cm varies from 24 to 89 table s1 it is thus indicated that cu pd catalysts were successfully prepared by coelectrodeposition over a wide range of compositions we tested the lsv curves of electrodes prepared under different electrodeposition conditions including coelectrodeposition time number of coelectrodeposition times and cu pd molar ratio fig 3 there is no obvious redox peak appeared in the lsv curves due to the electrochemical characteristics of carbon materials peel et al 2003 fig 3a and b therefore the abrupt increasing of current density can be attributed to nitrate reduction ghodbane et al 2008 a relatively high catalytic current density was received when cu pd was deposited three times with deposition time of 20 minutes fig 3a and b fig 3c shows the curve of time current with different deposition times there is an obvious serrated border in curves which is the typical deposit characteristics of porous materials with the increase of deposition times the current density of electrodes increases slightly indicating that more deposition times can increase the conductivity of electrodes fig 3d displays that the cu pd molar ration of 5 5 obtained high current density therefore the great electrodeposition conditions are the deposition three times 20 minutes of deposition time and cu pd molar ration of 5 5 fig 4 a shows the tem results of the cu5 pd5 catalysts the bimetal catalysts pd and cu dispersed well in cm the lattice fringes detected are attributed to cu pd alloys 111 facet 0 214 nm pdf 04 003 5221 chen et al 2018 and the obvious characteristic of metal catalysts by electrodeposition fig 4b the tem results of the cu5 pd5 catalysts after electrocatalysis process were shown in fig 4c and d and the lattice fringes have not changed the edx line scans on cross section are provided in the fig s3 indicating that bimetal catalysts can be deposited inside the pores enhancing the electrocatalytic activity xps spectra and xrd patterns are shown in the fig 5 the atom ratio of cu and pd the surface of cm cu5 pd5 is about 1 which coincides with the feeding mole ratio it can be seen from fig 5a the original cm mainly consists of c c bonds and c o bonds and the content of c c bonds is higher than c o bonds fig 5b displays the c1s of the cm cu5 pd5 obviously the content of c o bonds increased and new bonds c o appeared the c o bonds appearing on the cm surface provide more nucleation sites for bimetal which facilitates the high dispersion of bimetal particles and results in enhanced electrocatalysis ability for nitrate in addition these bonds could provide a stable electronic contact accelerating the electron transfer ability between cm and bimetal catalysis layer the emission peak for pd 3d of the cm cu5 pd5 at 340 6 pd 3d3 2 335 34 pd 3d5 2 341 38 pd 3d3 2 and 336 09 ev pd 3d5 2 can be fitted to the pd0 and pd2 species zhang et al 2014 fig 5c and the existence of pd2 indicating that the surface of pd is easily oxidated at room temperature ohashi et al 2010 as shown in fig 5d the two peaks for cu0 appear at 932 06 cu 2p3 2 and 951 75 ev cu 2p1 2 while the peak at 933 61 cu 2p3 2 953 59 cu 2p1 2 943 08 cu 2p3 2 and 962 38 ev cu 2p1 2 are fitted to cu2 zhang et al 2014 the ratio of cu0 and pd for the cm cu5 pd5 are 39 34 and 41 71 therefore we can conclude that the coelectrodeposition method is suitable for electrodepositing bimetal of cu and pd on cm the comparison of chemical structure of cm cu5 pd5 described by xps before and after electrochemical reduction were shown in the fig s4 there was no change according to the lmm auger spectra indicating that the catalyst is stable in the catalysis but peak of na 1s was appeared appearing of na 1s should be related with the residue of the supporting electrolyte fig 5e displays xrd patterns of different electrodes prepared by coelectrodeposition the peaks of all electrodes at 2θ 23 65 show the amorphous carbon nature of cm the peak of cm pd10 locates at approximately 2θ 40 39 and this peak become smooth and weak with the copper content increasing because of less pd content and the change of crystallinity the xrd pattern of cm cu5 pd5 shows one obvious diffraction peaks at around 41 4 which can be assigned to the 111 lattice planes of the face centered cubic fcc phase of cu pd alloy pdf 04 003 5221 chen et al 2018 besides the peak of cm cu10 is relatively weak suggesting that the cu has poor crystallinity neither pure pd nor pure cu diffraction peaks were shown in the bimetallic cm cu pd instead a single peak 2θ 41 75 appeared indicating that mono phased cu pd was produced during the coelectrodeposition process allemand et al 2011 3 2 nitrate electrochemical reduction the influence of pore size of cm on nitrate removal is shown in fig 6 and the pore size and pure water flux were displayed in the table s2 the single pass removal of nitrate of cm 8 55 15 is higher than cm 660 36 31 and cm 430 33 44 fig 6a indicating that the single pass removal of nitrate is improved with their pore size smaller when the pore size increased from 8 3 nm to 660 nm and the sn2 decreased from 47 00 to 39 50 table 1 with pore size increasing the permeate flux is increased leading to enhance ce and nitrate removal rate fig 6b d hydraulic retention time has a significant effect on the single pass removal of nitrate higher single pass removal of nitrate 55 15 was obtained when the hrt was 502 s fig 6e however the permeate flux with hrt of 120 s is twice as high as the permeate flux with hrt of 502 s fig 6f leading to the high ce fig 6g the nitrate removal rate is 5 40 10 4 mmol min 1 cm 2 when the hrt is 502 s lower than that of 120 s 9 06 10 4 mmol min 1 cm 2 fig 6h the effects of potential on nitrate removal were shown in table s3 and the nitrate removal and ce were poor in low potential 4 v vs sce thus 4 v vs sce was applied for nitrate electrochemical reduction the single pass removal of nitrate was enhanced after loading bimetal catalysts increasing from 55 15 to 97 92 in na2so4 electrolyte fig 7 a loading catalysts limited the permeate flux and obtained low ce fig 7b and c the nitrate removal rate eq s8 was reasonably used to evaluate the electrode electrocatalytic activity and reactor efficiency the nitrate removal rate increased from 5 40 10 4 to 1 01 10 3 mmol min 1 cm 2 by means of loading bimetal catalysts fig 7d correspondingly the single pass removal and removal rate was improved greatly because of the effect of bimetal catalysts the comparison of selectivity of products ce ec and electrical energy per order metric eeo before and after loading bimetal catalysts are shown in the table 1 besides increasing the conversion of nitrate and selectivity of n2 ec was decreased from 4 58 to 3 13 kwh mol 1 electrolyte also has important influence on nitrate removal the single pass removal of nitrate using cm cu5 pd5 with the electrolyte of na2so4 97 92 is higher than naoh electrolyte 90 60 fig 7a however naoh electrolyte is favorable to high nitrogen selectivity 96 40 the ce and nitrate removal rate were enhanced after loading bimetal catalysts increasing from 18 05 to 40 55 and 1 01 10 3 to 1 47 10 3 mmol min 1 cm 2 respectively because the permeate flux was enhanced in naoh electrolyte fig 7b and c the corresponding ec was decreased from 4 58 to 2 59 kwh mol 1 table 1 there is no n2o detected in the gas sample indicating that n2 is the main gas product in this reactor c cmnr using cm cu5 pd5 showed high reactor efficiency the comparison of nitrate removal between our work and other literature summarized in table 2 the c cmnr with cm cu5 pd5 adopted in the naoh electrolyte exhibited excellent nitrate removal rate 1 47 10 3 mmol min 1 cm 2 and high selectivity of n2 96 40 the nitrate removal rate can be one order of magnitude higher than literature abdallah et al 2014 couto et al 2016 dortsiou and kyriacou 2009 gayen et al 2018 ghodbane et al 2008 reyter et al 2009 katsounaros et al 2006 peel et al 2003 su et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of membrane pore size and hrt on the single pass removal of nitrate to shed light on the effects of the pore size of the membrane and hrt on the nitrate removal fig 8 a schematically shows a single nanochannel in cm 8 a single nitrate ion enters a pore in the membrane at the point a then its movement combines a brownian motion and an axial movement with the water driven by the trans membrane pressure gradience the ion will collide with the pore wall at b when the radial movement distance is larger than the pore radius r if this collision does not lead to an effective reaction the ion will reflect and collide with the opposite wall at c after another vertical moving distance larger than the diameter of the pore if the collision is effective the nitrate ions would be catalyzed to products such as n2 nh4 and no2 when the nitrate ions collide with the pore wall the probability of the nitrate ion being catalyzed can be enhanced with increasing of collision number and then the single pass removal of nitrate will be improved d is the sum of the radial component of the brownian motion distance and d can be calculated by eq 3 feynman et al 1989 3 d 2 6 kt h r t μ where the k is boltzmann s constant t is the room temperature k μ is the viscosity according to the eq 3 d is proportional to hrt the longer d would be caused by the longer hrt resulting in a higher probability of d r therefore the higher single pass removal of nitrate would be obtained with hrt increasing additionally hrt can be calculated by eq 4 4 h r t π r 2 l q l where l is thickness of membrane m r is the radius of the pore m ql is the volume flow m3 h 1 in a single pore the total flow of water through the membrane is the sum of ql kozeny constructed rock capillary model christian et al 2012 and the ql can be calculated by the eq 5 5 q l 9 π r 4 δ p 20 μ l where the δp is trans membrane pressure pa during ion going through the pore the collision number f can be calculated with d and r using eq 6 6 f d r 1 2 r the relationship between the d and r is closely related with the single pass removal of nitrate the smaller r would receive the higher f when d is a constant value additionally if r is a constant value f depends on d and d is proportional to hrt the higher f is caused by the longer hrt therefore decreasing pore size and increasing hrt can improve collision number resulting in higher single pass removal of nitrate concerning eqs 4 6 eq 6 can be displayed as the eq 7 7 f 1 2 30 3 r 2 k t δ p l the f is proportional to the l indicating that higher thickness of membrane would receive the higher collision number however the thinner membranes are what we desired because it can decrease trans membrane resistance in membrane filter process resulting in high permeate flux of membrane f is inversely proportional to r2 therefore decreasing pore size can effectively increase the collision number the collision number increases exponentially with the decreasing of pore size fig 8b 4 2 the mechanism of nitrate electrochemical reduction in c cmnr c cmnr with cm cu5 pd5 shows a high single pass removal of nitrate and high selectivity to the formation of n2 the schematic diagram of electrochemical reduction of nitrate in c cmnr is shown in the fig 9 due to the catalytic active sites on the pore walls the dissolved nitrate orange ball will be electrochemically reduced when the nitrate ion collides with the pore wall the nanopores provide a place in which the nitrate solution gets a high ratio of surface interface molecule amount to bulk molecule amount without contact with the active sites the probability of the nitrate ion colliding with the pore walls will be enhanced resulting in an improvement of the single pass removal of nitrate this reactor is easy to build and scale up with moderating work condition fast removal rate and free of additional chemical regents 4 3 the effects of catalysts and electrolyte on nitrate removal the electric field combining trans membrane pressure supplies an additional increase of the permeate flux leading to low energy consumption bhattacharyya and bera 2013 the small pore size can enhance permeate flux because it influences the structure of electric double layer increasing electroosmosis phenomenon the electroosmosis phenomenon provided by membrane with nanopores are more obvious than that with larger pore membranes because the stern layer and diffusion layer form the charged nanochannel with electric field the surplus ions in diffusion layer experience columbic force and moving to electrode which in turn result in electroosmosis flow the electroosmosis flow strongly depends on surface charge density and ζ potential bhattacharyya and bera 2015 which is affected by many factors such as porosity pore size of electrodes and ion concentration of electrolyte when the pore size of membrane decreased the interaction between ions and pores wall increases and the structure of electric double layer changes in nanochannel in addition the electrolyte influences the permeate flux because the current in naoh is higher than that in the na2so4 fig s5 shows that the cathode current in naoh is higher than that in na2so4 and the peak current of the cm cu5 pd5 electrode in naoh is more positive than that in na2so4 thus the electroosmosis phenomenon is more obvious in the electrolyte of naoh leading to high permeate flux the nitrate removal also relies on the electrolyte conditions ph and anions in the solution de vooys et al 2000 at different electrolyte circumstances there are different absorbed species covered on the electrode surface such as hydrogen species at low ph values and hydroxide or even oxide species at high ph values meanwhile different electrodes also influence the absorbed species the single pass removal of nitrate with the electrolyte of na2so4 is higher than naoh electrolyte as shown in fig 7 because most hydroxide species could be absorbed on the active sites of cathode unfavorably inhibiting the adsorption of nitrate de vooys et al 2000 martínez et al 2017 the selectivity of n2 in naoh electrolyte reaching 96 40 is triple to that in na2so4 electrolyte as naoh can neutralize the excess h produced from hydrogen evolution reaction inhibiting the formation of n h bonds and accelerating the formation of n n bonds martínez et al 2017 the isoelectric point pi of cathode materials also influences the selectivity of products carbon materials have a pi of 6 3 when the ph is 12 carbon materials present negative superficial charge producing positive counter ion layer i e h3o nh4 in equilibrium the ammonia present in this layer could prevent the lion of more ammonia this excess positive charge leads to the formation of n2 as a final product instead of ammonia marchesini et al 2012 therefore carbon materials used as the cathodes on naoh electrolyte can produce more n2 in the process of electrochemical reduction process ghodbane et al 2008 4 4 the mechanism of no3 removal to illustrate the effects of bimetal catalysts on the various possible reaction pathways we further carried out first principle calculation to obtain gibbs free energy diagrams different coverage of no3 predosed at the surface of cupd 111 were considered in order to identify optimal adsorption sites huai et al 2015 the no3 prefers bridge adsorption on pd sites fig 10 and the calculated average adsorption energies of no3 on cupd 111 surface are 1 76 ev however the average adsorption energies of no3 on pure pd 111 pure cu 111 and carbon support is about 1 34 1 65 and 0 13 ev respectively which indicate that the no3 is more easily adsorbed on the cupd 111 surface and the existence of cu can enhance the adsorption of no3 two pathways related to the formation of nh3 and n2 were compared according to free energy fig 10 the no3 can be catalyzed to no2 which can be further reduced to nh3 no or n2 on pd sites fig 11 clearly exhibits the free energy of the n2 and nh3 is 8 22 and 1 46 ev respectively suggesting that this process of nh3 formation is a nonspontaneous process therefore the n2 will be the main product on the cm cu pd surface which is in accordance with the experimental results the adsorption energy of no3 on the cupd 111 is 1 76 ev higher than that on the pd 111 1 34 ev cu 111 1 65 ev and carbon support 0 13 ev according to the table 3 the free energy of n2 on pd 111 cu 111 and carbon support is higher than that on cupd 111 indicating that nitrogen generation is much easier generate on cupd 111 pd 111 carbon support cu 111 and the metal pd can enhance the electrocatalysis ability of no3 to n2 according to above experiment result and dft analysis the reaction scheme can be explored initially the no3 was adsorbed on the electrode surface to form no3 ads eq 8 which was decomposed into no2 in general no2 ads was decomposed into no ads zhang et al 2021 however the adsorption energy of no on cm cu pd is greater than zero table 3 indicating that the adsorption process of no on electrode surface is endothermic and the no is not easily produced on the surface of cm cu pd electrode due to applied negative potential 4 v vs sce most adsorbed h atom produces gaseous hydrogen additionally the electrode surface is hydrophobic evidenced by the contact angle 100 8 of top layer fig s6 resulting in h2 desorption in electrode surface kuang et al 2018 thus the produced h2 can function as the reducing reagent to reduce no3 to n2 as displayed in eqs 8 12 jonoush et al 2020 on the other hand the h2 and h2o were also adsorbed on the electrode surface due to the low hydrogen dissociation energy of pd atom h2 can be dissociated to h atom on the pd sites and further adsorbed on the pd sites firstly until saturation then no3 start to adsorb on the cu site and the populated h atom can promote no3 reducing to n2 according as shown in eqs 13 18 shih et al 2020 the above hypothesis helps to explain that nitrogen is the main product during the cm cu pd electrode reactions 8 no3 no3 ads

removal reached 90 60 in naoh electrolyte the achieved nitrate removal rate was as high as 1 47 10 3 mmol min 1 cm 2 one order of magnitude higher than literature results and the main product was

was the major product formed on the surface of cm cu pd the bimetal catalysts enhance the adsorption of no3 on the surface of carbon membrane and increases the selectivity of n2 formation the

16461,encapsulation is a promising technology to retain and protect autotrophs for biological nitrogen removal one dimensional biofilm models have been used to describe encapsulated systems they do not however incorporate chemical sorption to the encapsulant nor do they adequately describe cell growth and distribution within the encapsulant in this research we developed a new model to describe encapsulated growth and activity of nitrosomonas europaea incorporating ammonium sorption to the alginate encapsulant batch and continuous flow reactors were used to verify the simulation results quantitative pcr and cross section fluorescence in situ hybridization were used to analyze the growth and spatial distribution of the encapsulated cells within alginate preferential growth of nitrosomonas near the surface of the encapsulant was predicted by the model and confirmed by experiments the modeling and experimental results also suggested that smaller encapsulants with a larger surface area to volume ratio would improve ammonia oxidation excessive aeration caused the breakage of the encapsulant resulting in unpredicted microbial release and washout overall our modeling approach is flexible and can be used to engineer and optimize encapsulated systems for enhanced biological nitrogen removal similar modeling approaches can be used to incorporate sorption of additional species within an encapsulant additional nitrogen converting microorganisms and the use of other encapsulation materials graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords encapsulation wastewater biological nitrogen removal mathematical model 1 introduction nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater relies on slow growing autotrophs for ammonia oxidation bagchi et al 2012 among recent advances in nutrient removal processes such as biofilm and membrane bioreactors encapsulation is a promising technology that can be used to retain and protect autotrophic biomass for enhanced nitrogen removal isaka et al 2017 wang et al 2021 previous studies on encapsulated systems however have focused on its overall application and performance overlooking fundamental interactions between the encapsulant the substrate and encapsulated microorganisms which could be important for predicting and improving performance there is increasing interest in improving sustainability energy efficiency and cost effectiveness of treatment processes to meet more stringent effluent regulations therefore a better understanding of encapsulant microorganism interactions could provide information that is critical for optimizing the construction and operation of encapsulated systems and as a result enabling sustainable energy efficient and cost effective biological nutrient removal encapsulated systems are distinct from suspended growth and biofilm systems because the encapsulant not only immobilizes microorganisms but also alters the internal encapsulant environment as a function of the encapsulant s mass transfer properties encapsulated nitrosomonas cells have been used as a model system for nitrification studies with various encapsulants including alginate van ginkel et al 1983 carrageenan wijffels and tramper 1989 polyvinyl alcohol seo et al 2001 and polyethylene glycol tanaka et al 1991 depending on the encapsulant used mass transfer of ammonium or oxygen to the encapsulated cells or ammonium adsorption within the encapsulant itself zhu et al 2020 could have impacts on the encapsulated growth of nitrifying cells indeed the mass transfer limitation of oxygen was shown to control the encapsulated growth of nitrosomonas in alginate benyahia and polomarkaki 2005 nevertheless to predictively deploy a well engineered system of encapsulated microorganisms for enhanced biological nitrogen removal the effect of mass transfer sorption and the spatial distribution and concentration of microorganisms on nitrogen cycling need to be predictable fortunately mathematical models that are capable of simulating the activity of ammonia oxidizers within an encapsulant matrix exist for example the one dimensional models were used to predict spatial distribution of encapsulated nitrosomonas europaea as a result of mass transfer hunik et al 1994 leenen et al 1997 wijffels et al 1995 1991 the encapsulated growth was limited by either setting a maximum biomass concentration leenen et al 1997 wijffels et al 1991 or by including limit of colony protrusion as an arbitrary volume wijffels et al 1995 models based on colony eruption however could deviate from the reality especially with low encapsulated biomass concentrations and strong encapsulants instead encapsulated cells may not expand and slough like cells in biofilm but increase in local cell density at fixed locations wijffels and tramper 1995 therefore a new model is needed to quantitatively resolve the distribution of microorganisms and include the adsorption of chemical species within the encapsulant banerjee et al 2019 finally even if sorption and encapsulated growth were incorporated into models a quantitative prediction of microbial distribution within the encapsulant would also require verification verification of such results presents challenges as well regarding the need to distinguish between live and dead cells wadhawan et al 2011 and the use of techniques to visualize or quantify growth spatially such as quantitative pcr qpcr and or fluorescence in situ hybridization fish such techniques have not been used in conjunction with encapsulated systems to verify model predictions the objectives of this study were to develop a flexible mathematical model that included the adsorption of chemical species in the encapsulant and that was able to simulate the temporal and spatial changes of alginate encapsulated cells we used nitrosomonas europaea as a model ammonia oxidizing bacterium and specifically incorporated ammonium adsorption to alginate into the model the model predictions were verified in both batch reactors and continuous flow reactors the effect of various reactor design and operational parameters including size of encapsulant initial encapsulated biomass concentration dissolved oxygen do and ph were simulated with the model and tested experimentally predictions on encapsulated growth were verified by qpcr and fish analyses the newly developed model should be adaptable to other microorganisms substrates and encapsulants and should serve as a useful and flexible way to gain insight on optimization strategies for efficient nitrogen removal with encapsulated systems 2 material and methods 2 1 cultivation and encapsulation of nitrosomonas europaea nitrosomonas europaea atcc 25978t was cultured in atcc medium 2265 at 30 c under aerobic conditions and aseptically transferred to a batch of fresh medium every 10 days liquid cultures were harvested by centrifugation at the end of each batch incubation cell pellets were re suspended in synthetic c and n free wastewater supplementary material peterson et al 2017 and mixed with an equal volume of 4 w w alginate the cell alginate mixture was dripped through a needle 1 or 2 mm into a 4 calcium chloride solution with a peristaltic pump 3 ml min to make spherical bead structures with approx diameter of 1 or 2 mm zhu et al 2018 the ca alginate beads were crosslinked for 2 h rinsed with deionized water and immediately used for reactor experiments abiotic beads were made identically but without the inclusion of the cell pellets in the synthetic wastewater alginate mixture 2 2 determination of alginate mass transfer coefficients partitioning coefficients h between alginate and water for ammonium nitrite and nitrate were measured by placing 10

concentration changes of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were monitored until an equilibrium concentration ct was observed the partitioning coefficient was linearly extrapolated according to the following equation both diffusion and sorption processes contribute to the h values measured experimentally 1 h c t c 0 c t m w m a l g diffusivities d of ammonium nitrite nitrate and oxygen in alginate were each measured independently in triplicate in a diaphragm cell fig s1 shimotori et al 2006 briefly two percent 2 w w alginate was prepared with bacteria free synthetic wastewater cast into membrane pucks thickness l 0 02 0 10 cm and cross linked overnight in 4 w v calcium chloride solution the cross sectional area a of the diaphragm cell was 4 5 cm2 ammonium nitrite or nitrate was added to the upstream cell and the changes of concentrations in the upstream cell cup and the downstream cell cdown were monitored in c and n free synthetic wastewater over time t peterson et al 2017 the volume of the downstream cell was vdown the partitioning coefficient was fixed according to the experimentally determined value and the breakthrough curves were linearly extrapolated to obtain the intercept according to the following equation fig s2 2 c d o w n v d o w n c u p a l h l 2 t h 6 d 2 3 reactor configuration and operation batch experiments for encapsulated growth were carried out in sponge capped 250 ml conical flasks on an orbital shaker 80 rpm without active aeration alginate encapsulated nitrosomonas were incubated in synthetic wastewater to which 50 mg n l ammonium was added as nh4cl at room temperature two ml water samples and 100 mg alginate bead samples were taken at each sampling time point two continuous stirred tank reactors cstr with working volumes of 200 ml were also used for experiments fig s2 the synthetic wastewater amended with different concentrations of ammonium or alkalinity see below was fed through an influent port at the bottom of the reactor at a flow rate of 0 28 ml min and drained through an overflow effluent port coarse bubble aeration was supplied through a port 0 5 cm in diameter in the middle of the reactor reactor 1 r1 was aerated at a high rate 200 ml min throughout the entire period of operation reactor 2 r2 was operated at a lower aeration rate that increased step wise over time 20 ml min on days 0 3 50 ml min on days 3 13 and 100 ml min on days 13 25 to maintain lower do levels the hydraulic retention time hrt was 12 h for both reactors the operation was conducted in two phases with different influent water characteristics phase 1 used an influent with 83 10 mg nh4 n l and 460 mg caco3 l alkalinity whereas phase 2 used an influent with 124 10 mg nh4 n l and 930 mg caco3 l alkalinity water samples were taken from the effluent and alginate bead samples were retrieved from the reactors with a 0 1 mm mesh sieve at each sampling time point the volumetric mass transfer coefficients kla for oxygen were determined experimentally tribe et al 1995 kla for both batch reactor and cstr setups were determined under different aeration rates the reactor containing synthetic wastewater without the addition of alginate beads was initially purged with nitrogen gas to reach a low do level do0 do was then continuously monitored dot with an optical do probe fdo 925 wtw until it reached close to saturation do values within about 30 min while agitation or aeration was active kla values were then linearly extrapolated as the slope according to the following equation 3 ln d o 0 d o t k l a t 2 4 water sample

microfiber filters whatman 934 ah for total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss analyses eaton et al 1998 alkalinity was measured by titration with sulfuric acid according to standard methods eaton et al 1998 water samples were filtered through 0 45 µm nylon filters and stored at 20 c before analysis soluble chemical oxygen demand and ammonium concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically by the dichromate digestion and salicylate methods respectively hach eaton et al 1998 nitrite and nitrate concentrations were measured by an ion chromatograph metrohm equipped with an as 18 column as described previously peterson et al 2017 detection limits were 0 1 mg n l for ammonium nitrite and nitrate the rate of ammonia oxidation was obtained from the maximum slope of linear ammonia consumption during each incubation the rates were then normalized to the initial biomass concentrations which were obtained by multiplying the results of qpcr targeting amoa with 1 55 10 10 mg dcw copy to convert to the unit of dry cell weight 2 5 qpcr targeting 16s rrna gene and amoa at each sampling point two aliquots of mixed liquor and two alginate bead samples were collected to quantify the suspended and encapsulated biomass concentrations respectively one of the samples was treated with propidium monoazide pma while the other sample was not enabling estimation of the abundance of live versus dead cells fig s4 yáñez et al 2011 briefly mixed liquor samples 0 5 ml were treated with pmaxx dye 20 mm biotium for 10 min according to the manufacturer s instructions both pma treated and untreated samples were then centrifuged at 15 000 g for 10 min the resultant pellets were re suspended with dna suspension buffer 10 mm tris 0 1 mm edta teknova and stored at 20 c all alginate bead samples 3 beads were dissolved by vigorously shaking in 1 ml citrate edta solution 55 mm sodium citrate 30 mm edta lopez et al 2017 for 5 min if pma treated the dissolved bead samples were treated with pma as described above all of the samples with or without pma treatment were centrifuged re suspended with dna suspension buffer and stored at 20 c cell pellets were directly used for qpcr without dna extraction to minimize the dna loss during the extraction step for this purpose we used an inhibitor tolerant qpcr mastermix ssoadvanced universal inhibitor tolerant sybr green supermix bio rad primer sets for bacterial 16s rrna gene 341f and 805r and amoa 1f and 2r table s4 were used for the quantification of total bacteria and nitrosomonas respectively oshiki et al 2018 the reaction was performed using the standard curve method with the steponeplus real time pcr system thermo fisher as described previously oshiki et al 2018 the amplification efficiencies for amoa and 16s rrna gene were maintained at 85 and 90 respectively 2 6 cross sectioning of alginate beads and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish alginate beads were washed with deionized water and fixed in 3 w v paraformaldehyde solution with 0 25 m cacl2 at 4 c for 2 h the fixed beads were then infiltrated stepwise in increasing concentrations of glycolmethacrylate gma 25 50 75 100 mcgowan and nagatomi 2013 hardeners were added to embed the beads in gma according to the manufacturer s instructions technovit 7100 kulzer gmbh embedded samples were stored in a desiccator before cross sectioning to 10 µm thick slices with a microtome microm hm505e fluorescence in situ hybridization was carried out on the slices to visualize the spatial distribution of nitrosomonas cells within the alginate beads a mixture of 5 6 fam fluorescein probes nso1225 neu and cluster6a192 were used to stain nitrosomonas as described previously shi et al 2016 antifade mountant with dapi prolong gold invitrogen was used as a dna counter stain no probe controls were prepared to verify the absence of autofluorescence images were captured from a motorized fluorescence microscope nikon eclipse 90i four images were captured under 40x magnification and tiled together to cover the entire cross section area images captured at 10 15 depths over a range of about 30 μm were compiled and used to cover the thickness of each cross section image denoizing was done using the advanced 3d deconvolution algorithm on nikon nis elements ar software encapsulated nitrosomonas was successfully stained with the fluorescence probes used on average 50 60 of cells were co stained with fam labeled probes and dapi in both r1 and r2 table s2 2 7 model construction a model of the encapsulated bacteria bioreactor was developed using aquasim 2 1 reichert 1994 model parameters were taken from a previous 1 d biofilm model ma et al 2017 the aob containing alginate beads were modeled as 1 d biofilms fig 1 the stoichiometric matrix processes and parameters are in the supplementary information the model used aquasim s biofilm compartment where the biofilm area reactor volume and influent flow rates and concentrations were set to the experimental values two particulate variables were included aob xn and alginate xalg diffusive mass transport of solids within the biofilm matrix was not considered different maximum densities for alginate ρalg and biomass particulates ρne were used in the model the local cell density of aob was reflected by the volume fraction of biomass εne whereas the initial volume fraction of alginate was set to 0 02 corresponding to 2 alginate beads the initial aob volume fraction was low but increased as they grew in areas with substrate limitation e g the bead interior the aob concentration decreased over time due to decay aob growth also tends to increase the overall bead thickness in the model the detachment velocity ude was set equal to the growth velocity uf thus an increase in biofilm thickness was matched by an equal amount of detachment maintaining a constant biofilm thickness the liquid diffusion layer at the biofilm liquid interface was assumed to be 100 μm marks et al 2019 reattachment of detached biomass was not considered in the model the bulk liquid was assumed to be well mixed biological reactions in the bulk were allowed but aob concentrations in the bulk were small for cstr operation due to the relatively short hydraulic retention time the kinetics of aob growth were based on the concentration of free ammonia fa and included inhibition by fa and free nitrous acid fna fa and fna were based on the ph and considering the carbonate buffer and acid production by aob metabolism sorption of ammonium onto alginate was modeled using an equilibrium process with a fictitious soluble variable as explained below to simulate ammonium adsorption to alginate a fictitious ammonium reservoir was created by adding a state variable cnh4 alg since the mass transfer of ammonium from the biofilm pore phase to alginate is dominated by diffusion chen et al 1997 the sorption process was modelled as an equilibrium process by using a very high reaction rate 107 d 1 the concentration of ammonium in alginate was therefore proportional to the bulk liquid concentration eq 4 the stoichiometric coefficient of ammonium sorption was then adjusted to the relative mass of alginate and bulk liquid by mass conservation 4 d c n h 4 a l g dt 10 7 m w m a l g h 1 c n h 4 w c n h 4 a l g the diffusivity of cnh4 alg in the biofilm was set to zero to prevent its mass transfer within the biofilm due to substrate gradients this reflects the fact that it is bound to the alginate and can only diffuse once it desorbs back into the pore liquid the experimentally measured diffusivities of soluble compounds in alginate were used in this model except for o2 which was taken from the literature kurosawa et al 1989 detailed kinetic and stoichiometric parameters were obtained from the literature without fitting table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 mass transfer properties the diffusivities and partitioning coefficients of ammonium nitrite nitrate and oxygen in 2 alginate are shown in table 1 ca alginate sorbed ammonium with a partitioning coefficient of 1 45 which could be attributed to hydrogen bond formation banerjee et al 2019 in contrast the partitioning coefficients for nitrite nitrate and oxygen were close to unity showing no preferential partitioning or adsorption to or from the alginate phase diffusivities of dissolved nitrogen species were lower in the ca alginate matrix compared to their diffusivities in water whereas the effective diffusivity of oxygen in alginate was similar to its aqueous diffusivity kurosawa et al 1989 the kla value for oxygen transfer into the batch reactor was 44 mg l 1d 1 at 80 rpm on orbital shaker whereas the kla values ranged from 20 to 210 with active aeration in the cstr reactors table s2 these experimentally determined mass transfer parameters were directly incorporated into the mathematical model for accurate predictions of the diffusion and partitioning of dissolved nitrogen species and oxygen 3 2 modeling of ammonium and encapsulated growth the model was constructed as described above with the overall structure shown in fig 1 it was used to simulate both batch and continuous flow reactors containing encapsulated nitrosomonas the simulation results incorporating growth and ammonium sorption were then compared to those obtained without the incorporation of sorption and growth processes as well as to the experimental results ammonium diffusion and sorption were successfully simulated following both pulse and continuous addition of ammonium fig s5a b as encapsulated microbes consume ammonia the addition of the capability to sorb ammonia resulted in alginate serving as both a sink and a source of ammonium damping changes in the modeled ammonium concentrations as shown in the simulation results with and without alginate particulates fig s5a b moreover the model simulated the increase in local cell density during encapsulated growth by incorporating an alginate particulate variable during growth the modeled encapsulated biomass particulates expanded within the alginate phase and replaced the modeled volume fraction of alginate particulates with biomass particulates in contrast when alginate particulate variables were removed from the model simulated growth showed a uniform encapsulated biomass concentration which did not align with the anticipated spatially variable growth patterns leenen et al 1997 fig s5c d 3 3 batch reactor performance and simulation batch reactors were constructed to verify the simulation results incorporating the new model components and to test different design parameters including beads size and initial biomass concentration during batch incubation encapsulated nitrosomonas europaea was capable of rapid ammonium oxidation to nitrite in approximately four days with simultaneous encapsulated cell growth fig 2 because whole alginate beads were dissolved for biomass quantification the experimental values shown in fig 2b represent the average concentration of encapsulated biomass across the entire bead depth in addition although eruption of encapsulated nitrosomonas micro colonies have been reported during longer incubations wijffels et al 1995 minimal escape of encapsulated nitrosomonas cells and also minimal to no growth of suspended nitrosomonas cells in the batch reactors were observed in these short term 5 day experiments reflected by the low concentrations of amoa from live cells in the bulk solution fig s6 no breakage of the alginate beads was observed indicating that the encapsulant was strong enough to retain encapsulated microorganisms over this short period of time the model was used to predict the batch reactor results incorporating the experimentally determined mass transfer parameters of alginate table 1 and kinetic and stoichiometric parameters for nitrosomonas europaea derived from the literature although none of the parameters were fit to the data the model predicted the experimental data for ammonia consumption and nitrite production extremely well r2 values are 0 98 and 0 97 respectively fig 2 with respect to growth the model was able to resolve the concentration of nitrosomonas europaea in the alginate beads as a function of depth enabling differentiation between growth at the alginate bead core 0 mm radius surface 1 mm radius and middle 0 5 mm radius fig 2b the best goodness of fit value was obtained between the experimental values for total average encapsulated amoa copy numbers and the simulated biomass concentrations at 0 5 mm radius r2 0 80 fig 2b given possible errors such as loss during sample preparation and 100 qpcr amplification efficiency the model performed very well the modeled biomass numbers were in units of weight which allowed an additional level of validation with respect to the simulated growth by correlating the measured amoa copy numbers to the simulated biomass weight via linear regression assuming two copies of the amoa per nitrosomonas cell norton et al 2002 the predicted single cell weight was 3 1 10 10 mg cell comparable to a reported value of 1 4 10 10 mg cell farges et al 2012 this provided an additional level of confidence in the model predictions even when applied to a simple batch system different ways in which the model could be used to improve the performance of an encapsulated system could be seen in general the modeled encapsulated biomass concentrations increased at the surface of the encapsulant bead assuming the encapsulant is a symmetrical sphere the model results also predicted lower do concentrations near the core of alginate beads especially during days 2 3 when ammonia oxidation was at its maximum rate fig 2c this was likely caused by oxygen diffusion limitations at the bead surface combined with the consumption of oxygen by nitrosomonas near the surface of the beads taken together these simulations suggest that a greater surface area to volume ratio s v would improve oxygen delivery to the encapsulated biomass and as a result ammonium oxidation rates these simulations also provide support for the idea that the low do zone within the beads could be used for the co encapsulation of aerobic aob predicted to grow near the bead surface and anaerobic bacteria such as denitrifiers or anammox bacteria bae et al 2017 additional experiments were performed to verify model predictions supporting the benefits of higher s v ratios in these experiments two different size beads 1 and 2 mm diam were used to encapsulate nitrosomonas and the ammonia oxidation rate was measured table 2 faster ammonia oxidation rates were observed in experimental systems containing smaller beads when similar initial biomass concentrations were encapsulated supporting the model predictions of higher ammonia oxidation rates with larger s v ratios it is likely that the s v ratio will be a critical design parameter for co encapsulation of other microorganisms as well bae et al 2015 highlighting this potential utility of this type of predictive model these simulations also suggest that some optimum biomass density exists in which oxygen availability is also optimized indeed this was observed in experiments in which varying initial concentrations of nitrosomonas were encapsulated and ammonia oxidation rates were measured table 2 it was observed both experimentally and via simulation that increasing the initial biomass concentrations resulted in smaller normalized ammonia oxidation rates table 2 as mentioned above this is probably a result of higher biomass densities becoming more oxygen limited initial biomass concentration can also affect the size and distribution of micro colony formation within the encapsulant over time wijffels et al 1994 with larger and more dispersed colonies forming with lower initial biomass concentrations finally the lowest ph 5 5 6 0 was predicted near the alginate bead core on days 3 4 fig 2d which was likely caused by the consumption of alkalinity within the bead during ammonia oxidation this could result in local inhibition of encapsulated nitrosomonas by fna under low ph conditions this might suggest the need to consider encapsulant alkalinity to maximize ammonium oxidation which could again be simulated prior to deploying an actual encapsulated system saving time and money 3 4 continuously stirred tank reactor performance and simulation cstrs would be expected to have different fluid flow and shear patterns compared to batch reactors and would also have relatively constant in reactor conditions substrate oxygen concentrations which could result in differences in the substrate oxygen penetration of the beads therefore two cstrs containing alginate encapsulated nitrosomonas europaea were operated under different aeration rates to study the ability of the model to accurately predict data trends in more complex and realistic systems specifically the effect of do modeled via changes to the kla values and alkalinity on the efficiency of nitrogen removal were evaluated do levels in the reactors were maintained at about 6 mg l in r1 and at about 3 mg l in r2 residual ammonium was detected in the effluent of both reactors during phase 1 operation during which the alkalinity to ammonium ratio was low 5 5 mg caco3 mg nh4 n resulting in ammonium removal efficiencies of 83 and 84 for r1 and r2 respectively fig 3 as the input ratio increased during phase 2 operation 7 5 mg caco3 mg nh4 n the ammonium removal efficiency also increased to 99 in both reactors until day 20 fig 3 nitrite was the major product of ammonia oxidation with nitrate concentrations below 2 mg n l in the effluent of both reactors during the entire operation period table s2 the results indicated successful retention of nitrosomonas within both cstrs as well as complete ammonia removal with sufficient alkalinity until day 20 the model successfully predicted overall data trends and the temporal changes of ammonium and nitrite in the effluent as well as the changes in do ph and alkalinity in the bulk solution in both reactors figs 3a b and s6 there were however two major discrepancies between the simulated and measured results during phase 2 operation 1 the performance of r1 deteriorated after day 20 most likely as a result of alginate bead breakage and 2 a higher experimental ammonium uptake in r2 was observed compared to the simulated results aeration and mixing can both create shear stress on alginate beads which could have led to the breakage of the encapsulant during cstr operation washout of the alginate debris from the reactor was detected as an increase in suspended solid concentrations in the effluent of r1 which had a higher aeration rate table s2 since encapsulated nitrosomonas could be lost with the washout of the alginate debris it is likely that the bead breakage and washout decreased nitrosomonas biomass in the reactor thereby decreasing ammonia oxidation performance a similar phenomenon was also observed in r2 during phase 2 operation when the aeration rate increased days 13 25 with respect to the higher experimental ammonium uptake in r2 and to some extent the over prediction of do in the same reactors it is likely that nitrosomonas escape from the encapsulant and floc formation within the bulk liquid was responsible in fact floc formation was observed visually during suspended solids measurements of effluent as well as via fish during phase 2 operation after day 22 in r1 and on day 27 in r2 figs 4 s8 because floc formation was not considered in the mathematical model it is likely that this resulted in the higher ammonia oxidation rates observed in both reactors than in the simulated results it is also possible that ammonium uptake by suspended heterotrophs occurred which was also missing in the model fig s8 replacing alginate with a mechanically stronger encapsulant could potentially avoid the accidental release of encapsulated nitrosomonas subsequent floc formation and likely eventual washout with respect to biomass growth the amoa qpcr results showed no significant increase in encapsulated nitrosomonas concentrations in r1 during phase 1 p 0 171 one way anova fig 3c and d r2 showed a slight increase in encapsulated nitrosomonas concentrations during phase 1 p 0 0004 one way anova minimal growth was also seen in the simulated biomass concentrations within the encapsulant except near the surface of the beads i e 1 mm radius fig 3e and f since the qpcr results only showed biomass concentrations averaged across all depths within an alginate bead fish was performed on bead cross sections to qualitatively verify the modeled growth predictions and the spatial distribution of encapsulated biomass within the bead fig 4 the increase in local cell densities observed via fish near the bead surfaces agreed well with the modeling results a uniform distribution of nitrosomonas was observed across the entire bead section immediately after encapsulation afterward nitrosomonas cell density increased within about 100 μm of the surface of alginate beads in both reactors as indicated by brighter fam signals in the near surface areas than the deeper areas of the alginate beads porous structures in alginate beads were observed where cell densities increased possibly due to the expansion of microcolonies and or the production of co2 or n2o by bacteria extensive bacterial growth could potentially lead to the release of encapsulated cells wijffels and tramper 1995 although this was not be observed in the fish results because the model did not account for bead breakage and nitrosomonas escape into the bulk solution model predictions of suspended growth were minimal to our knowledge this is the first time that cross section fish and qpcr are used in conjunction to verify model predictions of spatial changes of encapsulated biomass distribution over time 3 5 implications and engineering applications the model constructed and verified in this study provides performance predictions that can be used for the subsequent optimization of encapsulated systems for efficient biological nitrogen removal this study shows that critical design parameters for encapsulated systems including encapsulant size encapsulated biomass concentration and reactor operational conditions can be optimized via the use of the model which was able to predict the spatial gradients of substrates and electron donors acceptors generated by mass transfer adsorption desorption and microbial consumption production within the encapsulant we used nitrosomonas europaea encapsulated in alginate in this study to simplify the experimental setup nevertheless the model presented here is flexible and can be adapted to include different groups of nitrogen converting microorganisms such as denitrifiers and anammox bacteria by using the kinetic and stoichiometric parameters available in the literature for these organisms wang et al 2021 it should be possible to expand this model to simulate the differential growth and spatial distribution of multiple bacteria within the encapsulant furthermore the experimental and modeling approach used in this study could easily be used for other encapsulation materials including waterborne polyurethane lü et al 2019 polyacrylamide cruz et al 2018 and alginate based composite materials wang et al 2019 by incorporating different mass transfer parameters into the model overall this research should facilitate broader predictable application of encapsulated systems for biological nitrogen removal some limitations remain however and should be addressed first competitive growth of non embedded microbes in encapsulated systems could develop with the presence of various organic compounds in municipal wastewater this is not captured by the model in addition potential attachment and detachment of bacteria to the surface of encapsulant and its effect also requires further investigation moreover the durability of encapsulants such as alginate against mechanical erosion and biological degradation could potentially limit the applications of encapsulated systems in wastewater treatment suggesting that future research should focus on the development of durable and environmentally sustainable encapsulant materials wang et al 2021 4 conclusion the model developed in this study incorporated ammonium sorption to alginate and encapsulated growth of ammonia oxidizing bacteria the predictions of spatial and temporal changes in encapsulated biomass concentrations as well as nitrogen removal efficiency were experimentally verified with batch and continuous flow reactors parameters affecting the performance of encapsulated reactors were simulated and tested including bead size initial biomass concentration and aeration rate overall this study developed a mathematical

16461,encapsulation is a promising technology to retain and protect autotrophs for biological nitrogen removal one dimensional biofilm models have been used to describe encapsulated systems they do not however incorporate chemical sorption to the encapsulant nor do they adequately describe cell growth and distribution within the encapsulant in this research we developed a new model to describe encapsulated growth and activity of nitrosomonas europaea incorporating ammonium sorption to the alginate encapsulant batch and continuous flow reactors were used to verify the simulation results quantitative pcr and cross section fluorescence in situ hybridization were used to analyze the growth and spatial distribution of the encapsulated cells within alginate preferential growth of nitrosomonas near the surface of the encapsulant was predicted by the model and confirmed by experiments the modeling and experimental results also suggested that smaller encapsulants with a larger surface area to volume ratio would improve ammonia oxidation excessive aeration caused the breakage of the encapsulant resulting in unpredicted microbial release and washout overall our modeling approach is flexible and can be used to engineer and optimize encapsulated systems for enhanced biological nitrogen removal similar modeling approaches can be used to incorporate sorption of additional species within an encapsulant additional nitrogen converting microorganisms and the use of other encapsulation materials graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords encapsulation wastewater biological nitrogen removal mathematical model 1 introduction nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater relies on slow growing autotrophs for ammonia oxidation bagchi et al 2012 among recent advances in nutrient removal processes such as biofilm and membrane bioreactors encapsulation is a promising technology that can be used to retain and protect autotrophic biomass for enhanced nitrogen removal isaka et al 2017 wang et al 2021 previous studies on encapsulated systems however have focused on its overall application and performance overlooking fundamental interactions between the encapsulant the substrate and encapsulated microorganisms which could be important for predicting and improving performance there is increasing interest in improving sustainability energy efficiency and cost effectiveness of treatment processes to meet more stringent effluent regulations therefore a better understanding of encapsulant microorganism interactions could provide information that is critical for optimizing the construction and operation of encapsulated systems and as a result enabling sustainable energy efficient and cost effective biological nutrient removal encapsulated systems are distinct from suspended growth and biofilm systems because the encapsulant not only immobilizes microorganisms but also alters the internal encapsulant environment as a function of the encapsulant s mass transfer properties encapsulated nitrosomonas cells have been used as a model system for nitrification studies with various encapsulants including alginate van ginkel et al 1983 carrageenan wijffels and tramper 1989 polyvinyl alcohol seo et al 2001 and polyethylene glycol tanaka et al 1991 depending on the encapsulant used mass transfer of ammonium or oxygen to the encapsulated cells or ammonium adsorption within the encapsulant itself zhu et al 2020 could have impacts on the encapsulated growth of nitrifying cells indeed the mass transfer limitation of oxygen was shown to control the encapsulated growth of nitrosomonas in alginate benyahia and polomarkaki 2005 nevertheless to predictively deploy a well engineered system of encapsulated microorganisms for enhanced biological nitrogen removal the effect of mass transfer sorption and the spatial distribution and concentration of microorganisms on nitrogen cycling need to be predictable fortunately mathematical models that are capable of simulating the activity of ammonia oxidizers within an encapsulant matrix exist for example the one dimensional models were used to predict spatial distribution of encapsulated nitrosomonas europaea as a result of mass transfer hunik et al 1994 leenen et al 1997 wijffels et al 1995 1991 the encapsulated growth was limited by either setting a maximum biomass concentration leenen et al 1997 wijffels et al 1991 or by including limit of colony protrusion as an arbitrary volume wijffels et al 1995 models based on colony eruption however could deviate from the reality especially with low encapsulated biomass concentrations and strong encapsulants instead encapsulated cells may not expand and slough like cells in biofilm but increase in local cell density at fixed locations wijffels and tramper 1995 therefore a new model is needed to quantitatively resolve the distribution of microorganisms and include the adsorption of chemical species within the encapsulant banerjee et al 2019 finally even if sorption and encapsulated growth were incorporated into models a quantitative prediction of microbial distribution within the encapsulant would also require verification verification of such results presents challenges as well regarding the need to distinguish between live and dead cells wadhawan et al 2011 and the use of techniques to visualize or quantify growth spatially such as quantitative pcr qpcr and or fluorescence in situ hybridization fish such techniques have not been used in conjunction with encapsulated systems to verify model predictions the objectives of this study were to develop a flexible mathematical model that included the adsorption of chemical species in the encapsulant and that was able to simulate the temporal and spatial changes of alginate encapsulated cells we used nitrosomonas europaea as a model ammonia oxidizing bacterium and specifically incorporated ammonium adsorption to alginate into the model the model predictions were verified in both batch reactors and continuous flow reactors the effect of various reactor design and operational parameters including size of encapsulant initial encapsulated biomass concentration dissolved oxygen do and ph were simulated with the model and tested experimentally predictions on encapsulated growth were verified by qpcr and fish analyses the newly developed model should be adaptable to other microorganisms substrates and encapsulants and should serve as a useful and flexible way to gain insight on optimization strategies for efficient nitrogen removal with encapsulated systems 2 material and methods 2 1 cultivation and encapsulation of nitrosomonas europaea nitrosomonas europaea atcc 25978t was cultured in atcc medium 2265 at 30 c under aerobic conditions and aseptically transferred to a batch of fresh medium every 10 days liquid cultures were harvested by centrifugation at the end of each batch incubation cell pellets were re suspended in synthetic c and n free wastewater supplementary material peterson et al 2017 and mixed with an equal volume of 4 w w alginate the cell alginate mixture was dripped through a needle 1 or 2 mm into a 4 calcium chloride solution with a peristaltic pump 3 ml min to make spherical bead structures with approx diameter of 1 or 2 mm zhu et al 2018 the ca alginate beads were crosslinked for 2 h rinsed with deionized water and immediately used for reactor experiments abiotic beads were made identically but without the inclusion of the cell pellets in the synthetic wastewater alginate mixture 2 2 determination of alginate mass transfer coefficients partitioning coefficients h between alginate and water for ammonium nitrite and nitrate were measured by placing 10

concentration changes of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were monitored until an equilibrium concentration ct was observed the partitioning coefficient was linearly extrapolated according to the following equation both diffusion and sorption processes contribute to the h values measured experimentally 1 h c t c 0 c t m w m a l g diffusivities d of ammonium nitrite nitrate and oxygen in alginate were each measured independently in triplicate in a diaphragm cell fig s1 shimotori et al 2006 briefly two percent 2 w w alginate was prepared with bacteria free synthetic wastewater cast into membrane pucks thickness l 0 02 0 10 cm and cross linked overnight in 4 w v calcium chloride solution the cross sectional area a of the diaphragm cell was 4 5 cm2 ammonium nitrite or nitrate was added to the upstream cell and the changes of concentrations in the upstream cell cup and the downstream cell cdown were monitored in c and n free synthetic wastewater over time t peterson et al 2017 the volume of the downstream cell was vdown the partitioning coefficient was fixed according to the experimentally determined value and the breakthrough curves were linearly extrapolated to obtain the intercept according to the following equation fig s2 2 c d o w n v d o w n c u p a l h l 2 t h 6 d 2 3 reactor configuration and operation batch experiments for encapsulated growth were carried out in sponge capped 250 ml conical flasks on an orbital shaker 80 rpm without active aeration alginate encapsulated nitrosomonas were incubated in synthetic wastewater to which 50 mg n l ammonium was added as nh4cl at room temperature two ml water samples and 100 mg alginate bead samples were taken at each sampling time point two continuous stirred tank reactors cstr with working volumes of 200 ml were also used for experiments fig s2 the synthetic wastewater amended with different concentrations of ammonium or alkalinity see below was fed through an influent port at the bottom of the reactor at a flow rate of 0 28 ml min and drained through an overflow effluent port coarse bubble aeration was supplied through a port 0 5 cm in diameter in the middle of the reactor reactor 1 r1 was aerated at a high rate 200 ml min throughout the entire period of operation reactor 2 r2 was operated at a lower aeration rate that increased step wise over time 20 ml min on days 0 3 50 ml min on days 3 13 and 100 ml min on days 13 25 to maintain lower do levels the hydraulic retention time hrt was 12 h for both reactors the operation was conducted in two phases with different influent water characteristics phase 1 used an influent with 83 10 mg nh4 n l and 460 mg caco3 l alkalinity whereas phase 2 used an influent with 124 10 mg nh4 n l and 930 mg caco3 l alkalinity water samples were taken from the effluent and alginate bead samples were retrieved from the reactors with a 0 1 mm mesh sieve at each sampling time point the volumetric mass transfer coefficients kla for oxygen were determined experimentally tribe et al 1995 kla for both batch reactor and cstr setups were determined under different aeration rates the reactor containing synthetic wastewater without the addition of alginate beads was initially purged with nitrogen gas to reach a low do level do0 do was then continuously monitored dot with an optical do probe fdo 925 wtw until it reached close to saturation do values within about 30 min while agitation or aeration was active kla values were then linearly extrapolated as the slope according to the following equation 3 ln d o 0 d o t k l a t 2 4 water sample analysis ph and do levels were measured in situ during batch reactor and cstr operation with an atc ph probe ross ultra orion and an optical do probe mixed liquor samples were filtered through glass microfiber filters whatman 934 ah for total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss analyses eaton et al 1998 alkalinity was measured by titration with sulfuric acid according to standard methods eaton et al 1998 water samples were filtered through 0 45 µm nylon filters and stored at 20 c before analysis soluble chemical oxygen demand and ammonium concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically by the dichromate digestion and salicylate methods respectively hach eaton et al 1998 nitrite and nitrate concentrations were measured by an ion chromatograph metrohm equipped with an as 18 column as described previously peterson et al 2017 detection limits were 0 1 mg n l for ammonium nitrite and nitrate the rate of ammonia oxidation was obtained from the maximum slope of linear ammonia consumption during each incubation the rates were then normalized to the initial biomass concentrations which were obtained by multiplying the results of qpcr targeting amoa with 1 55 10 10 mg dcw copy to convert to the unit of dry cell weight 2 5 qpcr targeting 16s rrna gene and amoa at each sampling point two aliquots of mixed liquor and two alginate bead samples were collected to quantify the suspended and encapsulated biomass concentrations respectively one of the samples was treated with propidium monoazide pma while the other sample was not enabling estimation of the abundance of live versus dead cells fig s4 yáñez et al 2011 briefly mixed liquor samples 0 5 ml were treated with pmaxx dye 20 mm biotium for 10 min according to the manufacturer s instructions both pma treated and untreated samples were then centrifuged at 15 000 g for 10 min the resultant pellets were re suspended with dna suspension buffer 10 mm tris 0 1 mm edta teknova and stored at 20 c all alginate bead samples 3 beads were dissolved by vigorously shaking in 1 ml citrate edta solution 55 mm sodium citrate 30 mm edta lopez et al 2017 for 5 min if pma treated the dissolved bead samples were treated with pma as described above all of the samples with or without pma treatment were centrifuged re suspended with dna suspension buffer and stored at 20 c cell pellets were directly used for qpcr without dna extraction to minimize the dna loss during the extraction step for this purpose we used an inhibitor tolerant qpcr mastermix ssoadvanced universal inhibitor tolerant sybr green supermix bio rad primer sets for bacterial 16s rrna gene 341f and 805r and amoa 1f and 2r table s4 were used for the quantification of total bacteria and nitrosomonas respectively oshiki et al 2018 the reaction was performed using the standard curve method with the steponeplus real time pcr system thermo fisher as described previously oshiki et al 2018 the amplification efficiencies for amoa and 16s rrna gene were maintained at 85 and 90 respectively 2 6 cross sectioning of alginate beads and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish alginate beads were washed with deionized water and fixed in 3 w v paraformaldehyde solution with 0 25 m cacl2 at 4 c for 2 h the fixed beads were then infiltrated stepwise in increasing concentrations of glycolmethacrylate gma 25 50 75 100 mcgowan and nagatomi 2013 hardeners were added to embed the beads in gma according to the manufacturer s instructions technovit 7100 kulzer gmbh embedded samples were stored in a desiccator before cross sectioning to 10 µm thick slices with a microtome microm hm505e fluorescence in situ hybridization was carried out on the slices to visualize the spatial distribution of nitrosomonas cells within the alginate beads a mixture of 5 6 fam fluorescein probes nso1225 neu and cluster6a192 were used to stain nitrosomonas as described previously shi et al 2016 antifade mountant with dapi prolong gold invitrogen was used as a dna counter stain no probe controls were prepared to verify the absence of autofluorescence images were captured from a motorized fluorescence microscope nikon eclipse 90i four images were captured under 40x magnification and tiled together to cover the entire cross section area images captured at 10 15 depths over a range of about 30 μm were compiled and used to cover the thickness of each cross section image denoizing was done using the advanced 3d deconvolution algorithm on nikon nis elements ar software encapsulated nitrosomonas was successfully stained with the fluorescence probes used on average 50 60 of cells were co stained with fam labeled probes and dapi in both r1 and r2 table s2 2 7 model construction a model of the encapsulated bacteria bioreactor was developed using aquasim 2 1 reichert 1994 model parameters were taken from a previous 1 d biofilm model ma et al 2017 the aob containing alginate beads were modeled as 1 d biofilms fig 1 the stoichiometric matrix processes and parameters are in the supplementary information the model used aquasim s biofilm compartment where the biofilm area reactor volume and influent flow rates and concentrations were set to the experimental values two particulate variables were included aob xn and alginate xalg diffusive mass transport of solids within the biofilm matrix was not considered different maximum densities for alginate ρalg and biomass particulates ρne were used in the model the local cell density of aob was reflected by the volume fraction of biomass εne whereas the initial volume fraction of alginate was set to 0 02 corresponding to 2 alginate beads the initial aob volume fraction was low but increased as they grew in areas with substrate limitation e g the bead interior the aob concentration decreased over time due to decay aob growth also tends to increase the overall bead thickness in the model the detachment velocity ude was set equal to the growth velocity uf thus an increase in biofilm thickness was matched by an equal amount of detachment maintaining a constant biofilm thickness the liquid diffusion layer at the biofilm liquid interface was assumed to be 100 μm marks et al 2019 reattachment of detached biomass was not considered in the model the bulk liquid was assumed to be well mixed biological reactions in the bulk were allowed but aob concentrations in the bulk were small for cstr operation due to the relatively short hydraulic retention time the kinetics of aob growth were based on the concentration of free ammonia fa and included inhibition by fa and free nitrous acid fna fa and fna were based on the ph and considering the carbonate buffer and acid production by aob metabolism sorption of ammonium onto alginate was modeled using an equilibrium process with a fictitious soluble variable as explained below to simulate ammonium adsorption to alginate a fictitious ammonium reservoir was created by adding a state variable cnh4 alg since the mass transfer of ammonium from the biofilm pore phase to alginate is dominated by diffusion chen et al 1997 the sorption process was modelled as an equilibrium process by using a very high reaction rate 107 d 1 the concentration of ammonium in alginate was therefore proportional to the bulk liquid concentration eq 4 the stoichiometric coefficient of ammonium sorption was then adjusted to the relative mass of alginate and bulk liquid by mass conservation 4 d c n h 4 a l g dt 10 7 m w m a l g h 1 c n h 4 w c n h 4 a l g the diffusivity of cnh4 alg in the biofilm was set to zero to prevent its mass transfer within the biofilm due to substrate gradients this reflects the fact that it is bound to the alginate and can only diffuse once it desorbs back into the pore liquid the experimentally measured diffusivities of soluble compounds in alginate were used in this model except for o2 which was taken from the literature kurosawa et al 1989 detailed kinetic and stoichiometric parameters were obtained from the literature without fitting table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 mass transfer properties the diffusivities and partitioning coefficients of ammonium nitrite nitrate and oxygen in 2 alginate are shown in table 1 ca alginate sorbed ammonium with a partitioning coefficient of 1 45 which could be attributed to hydrogen bond formation banerjee et al 2019 in contrast the partitioning coefficients for nitrite nitrate and oxygen were close to unity showing no preferential partitioning or adsorption to or from the alginate phase diffusivities of dissolved nitrogen species were lower in the ca alginate matrix compared to their diffusivities in water whereas the effective diffusivity of oxygen in alginate was similar to its aqueous diffusivity kurosawa et al 1989 the kla value for oxygen transfer into the batch reactor was 44 mg l 1d 1 at 80 rpm on orbital shaker whereas the kla values ranged from 20 to 210 with active aeration in the cstr reactors table s2 these experimentally determined mass transfer parameters were directly incorporated into the mathematical model for accurate predictions of the diffusion and partitioning of dissolved nitrogen species and oxygen 3 2 modeling of ammonium and encapsulated growth the model was constructed as described above with the overall structure shown in fig 1 it was used to simulate both batch and continuous flow reactors containing encapsulated nitrosomonas the simulation results incorporating growth and ammonium sorption were then compared to those obtained without the incorporation of sorption and growth processes as well as to the experimental results ammonium diffusion and sorption were successfully simulated following both pulse and continuous addition of ammonium fig s5a b as encapsulated microbes consume ammonia the addition of the capability to sorb ammonia resulted in alginate serving as both a sink and a source of ammonium damping changes in the modeled ammonium concentrations as shown in the simulation results with and without alginate particulates fig s5a b moreover the model simulated the increase in local cell density during encapsulated growth by incorporating an alginate particulate variable during growth the modeled encapsulated biomass particulates expanded within the alginate phase and replaced the modeled volume fraction of alginate particulates with biomass particulates in contrast when alginate particulate variables were removed from the model simulated growth showed a uniform encapsulated biomass concentration which did not align with the anticipated spatially variable growth patterns leenen et al 1997 fig s5c d 3 3 batch reactor performance and simulation batch reactors were constructed to verify the simulation results incorporating the new model components and to test different design parameters including beads size and initial biomass concentration during batch incubation encapsulated nitrosomonas europaea was capable of rapid ammonium oxidation to nitrite in approximately four days with simultaneous encapsulated cell growth fig 2 because whole alginate beads were dissolved for biomass quantification the experimental values shown in fig 2b represent the average concentration of encapsulated biomass across the entire bead depth in addition although eruption of encapsulated nitrosomonas micro colonies have been reported during longer incubations wijffels et al 1995 minimal escape of encapsulated nitrosomonas cells and also minimal to no growth of suspended nitrosomonas cells in the batch reactors were observed in these short term 5 day experiments reflected by the low concentrations of amoa from live cells in the bulk solution fig s6 no breakage of the alginate beads was observed indicating that the encapsulant was strong enough to retain encapsulated microorganisms over this short period of time the model was used to predict the batch reactor results incorporating the experimentally determined mass transfer parameters of alginate table 1 and kinetic and stoichiometric parameters for nitrosomonas europaea derived from the literature although none of the parameters were fit to the data the model predicted the experimental data for ammonia consumption and nitrite production extremely well r2 values are 0 98 and 0 97 respectively fig 2 with respect to growth the model was able to resolve the concentration of nitrosomonas europaea in the alginate beads as a function of depth enabling differentiation between growth at the alginate bead core 0 mm radius surface 1 mm radius and middle 0 5 mm radius fig 2b the best goodness of fit value was obtained between the experimental values for total average encapsulated amoa copy numbers and the simulated biomass concentrations at 0 5 mm radius r2 0 80 fig 2b given possible errors such as loss during sample preparation and 100 qpcr amplification efficiency the model performed very well the modeled biomass numbers were in units of weight which allowed an additional level of validation with respect to the simulated growth by correlating the measured amoa copy numbers to the simulated biomass weight via linear regression assuming two copies of the amoa per nitrosomonas cell norton et al 2002 the predicted single cell weight was 3 1 10 10 mg cell comparable to a reported value of 1 4 10 10 mg cell farges et al 2012 this provided an additional level of confidence in the model predictions even when applied to a simple batch system different ways in which the model could be used to improve the performance of an encapsulated system could be seen in general the modeled encapsulated biomass concentrations increased at the surface of the encapsulant bead assuming the encapsulant is a symmetrical sphere the model results also predicted lower do concentrations near the core of alginate beads especially during days 2 3 when ammonia oxidation was at its maximum rate fig 2c this was likely caused by oxygen diffusion limitations at the bead surface combined with the consumption of oxygen by nitrosomonas near the surface of the beads taken together these simulations suggest that a greater surface area to volume ratio s v would improve oxygen delivery to the encapsulated biomass and as a result ammonium oxidation rates these simulations also provide support for the idea that the low do zone within the beads could be used for the co encapsulation of aerobic aob predicted to grow near the bead surface and anaerobic bacteria such as denitrifiers or anammox bacteria bae et al 2017 additional experiments were performed to verify model predictions supporting the benefits of higher s v ratios in these experiments two different size beads 1 and 2 mm diam were used to encapsulate nitrosomonas and the ammonia oxidation rate was measured table 2 faster ammonia oxidation rates were observed in experimental systems containing smaller beads when similar initial biomass concentrations were encapsulated supporting the model predictions of higher ammonia oxidation rates with larger s v ratios it is likely that the s v ratio will be a critical design parameter for co encapsulation of other microorganisms as well bae et al 2015 highlighting this potential utility of this type of predictive model these simulations also suggest that some optimum biomass density exists in which oxygen availability is also optimized indeed this was observed in experiments in which varying initial concentrations of nitrosomonas were encapsulated and ammonia oxidation rates were measured table 2 it was observed both experimentally and via simulation that increasing the initial biomass concentrations resulted in smaller normalized ammonia oxidation rates table 2 as mentioned above this is probably a result of higher biomass densities becoming more oxygen limited initial biomass concentration can also affect the size and distribution of micro colony formation within the encapsulant over time wijffels et al 1994 with larger and more dispersed colonies forming with lower initial biomass concentrations finally the lowest ph 5 5 6 0 was predicted near the alginate bead core on days 3 4 fig 2d which was likely caused by the consumption of alkalinity within the bead during ammonia oxidation this could result in local inhibition of encapsulated nitrosomonas by fna under low ph conditions this might suggest the need to consider encapsulant alkalinity to maximize ammonium oxidation which could again be simulated prior to deploying an actual encapsulated system saving time and money 3 4 continuously stirred tank reactor performance and simulation cstrs would be expected to have different fluid flow and shear patterns compared to batch reactors and would also have relatively constant in reactor conditions substrate oxygen concentrations which could result in differences in the substrate oxygen penetration of the beads therefore two cstrs containing alginate encapsulated nitrosomonas europaea were operated under different aeration rates to study the ability of the model to accurately predict data trends in more complex and realistic systems specifically the effect of do modeled via changes to the kla values and alkalinity on the efficiency of nitrogen removal were evaluated do levels in the reactors were maintained at about 6 mg l in r1 and at about 3 mg l in r2 residual ammonium was detected in the effluent of both reactors during phase 1 operation during which the alkalinity to ammonium ratio was low 5 5 mg caco3 mg nh4 n resulting in ammonium removal efficiencies of 83 and 84 for r1 and r2 respectively fig 3 as the input ratio increased during phase 2 operation 7 5 mg caco3 mg nh4 n the ammonium removal efficiency also increased to 99 in both reactors until day 20 fig 3 nitrite was the major product of ammonia oxidation with nitrate concentrations below 2 mg n l in the effluent of both reactors during the entire operation period table s2 the results indicated successful retention of nitrosomonas within both cstrs as well as complete ammonia removal with sufficient alkalinity until day 20 the model successfully predicted overall data trends and the temporal changes of ammonium and nitrite in the effluent as well as the changes in do ph and alkalinity in the bulk solution in both reactors figs 3a b and s6 there were however two major discrepancies between the simulated and measured results during phase 2 operation 1 the performance of r1 deteriorated after day 20 most likely as a result of alginate bead breakage and 2 a higher experimental ammonium uptake in r2 was observed compared to the simulated results aeration and mixing can both create shear stress on alginate beads which could have led to the breakage of the encapsulant during cstr operation washout of the alginate debris from the reactor was detected as an increase in suspended solid concentrations in the effluent of r1 which had a higher aeration rate table s2 since encapsulated nitrosomonas could be lost with the washout of the alginate debris it is likely that the bead breakage and washout decreased nitrosomonas biomass in the reactor thereby decreasing ammonia oxidation performance a similar phenomenon was also observed in r2 during phase 2 operation when the aeration rate increased days 13 25 with respect to the higher experimental ammonium uptake in r2 and to some extent the over prediction of do in the same reactors it is likely that nitrosomonas escape from the encapsulant and floc formation within the bulk liquid was responsible in fact floc formation was observed visually during suspended solids measurements of effluent as well as via fish during phase 2 operation after day 22 in r1 and on day 27 in r2 figs 4 s8 because floc formation was not considered in the mathematical model it is likely that this resulted in the higher ammonia oxidation rates observed in both reactors than in the simulated results it is also possible that ammonium uptake by suspended heterotrophs occurred which was also missing in the model fig s8 replacing alginate with a mechanically stronger encapsulant could potentially avoid the accidental release of encapsulated nitrosomonas subsequent floc formation and likely eventual washout with respect to biomass growth the amoa qpcr results showed no significant increase in encapsulated nitrosomonas concentrations in r1 during phase 1 p 0 171 one way anova fig 3c and d r2 showed a slight increase in encapsulated nitrosomonas concentrations during phase 1 p 0 0004 one way anova minimal growth was also seen in the simulated biomass concentrations within the encapsulant except near the surface of the beads i e 1 mm radius fig 3e and f since the qpcr results only showed biomass concentrations averaged across all depths within an alginate bead fish was performed on bead cross sections to qualitatively verify the modeled growth predictions and the spatial distribution of encapsulated biomass within the bead fig 4 the increase in local cell densities observed via fish near the bead surfaces agreed well with the modeling results a uniform distribution of nitrosomonas was observed across the entire bead section immediately after encapsulation afterward nitrosomonas cell density increased within about 100 μm of the surface of alginate beads in both reactors as indicated by brighter fam signals in the near surface areas than the deeper areas of the alginate beads porous structures in alginate beads were observed where cell densities increased possibly due to the expansion of microcolonies and or the production of co2 or n2o by bacteria extensive bacterial growth could potentially lead to the release of encapsulated cells wijffels and tramper 1995 although this was not be observed in the fish results because the model did not account for bead breakage and nitrosomonas escape into the bulk solution model predictions of suspended growth were minimal to our knowledge this is the first time that cross section fish and qpcr are used in conjunction to verify model predictions of spatial changes of encapsulated biomass distribution over time 3 5 implications and engineering applications the model constructed and verified in this study provides performance predictions that can be used for the subsequent optimization of encapsulated systems for efficient biological nitrogen removal this study shows that critical design parameters for encapsulated systems including encapsulant size encapsulated biomass concentration and reactor operational conditions can be optimized via the use of the model which was able to predict the spatial gradients of substrates and electron donors acceptors generated by mass transfer adsorption desorption and microbial consumption production within the encapsulant we used nitrosomonas europaea encapsulated in alginate in this study to simplify the experimental setup nevertheless the model presented here is flexible and can be adapted to include different groups of nitrogen converting microorganisms such as denitrifiers and anammox bacteria by using the kinetic and stoichiometric parameters available in the literature for these organisms wang et al 2021 it should be possible to expand this model to simulate the differential growth and spatial distribution of multiple bacteria within the encapsulant furthermore the experimental and modeling approach used in this study could easily be used for other encapsulation materials including waterborne polyurethane lü et al 2019 polyacrylamide cruz et al 2018 and alginate based composite materials wang et al 2019 by incorporating different mass transfer parameters into the model overall this research should facilitate broader predictable application of encapsulated systems for biological nitrogen removal some limitations remain however and should be addressed first competitive growth of non embedded microbes in encapsulated systems could develop with the presence of various organic compounds in municipal wastewater this is not captured by the model in addition potential attachment and detachment of bacteria to the surface of encapsulant and its effect also requires further investigation moreover the durability of encapsulants such as alginate against mechanical erosion and biological degradation could potentially limit the applications of encapsulated systems in wastewater treatment suggesting that future research should focus on the development of durable and environmentally sustainable encapsulant materials wang et al 2021 4 conclusion the model developed in this study incorporated ammonium sorption to alginate and encapsulated growth of ammonia oxidizing bacteria the predictions of spatial and temporal changes in encapsulated biomass concentrations as well as nitrogen removal efficiency were experimentally verified with batch and continuous flow reactors parameters affecting the performance of encapsulated reactors were simulated and tested including bead size initial biomass concentration and aeration rate overall this study developed a mathematical tool verified with new experimental methods that should enable a priori optimization of encapsulation systems for biological nitrogen removal expanding the use of this promising technology credit

16462,sunlight plays an important role in the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses in water here we present a model that is able to predict the kinetics of direct virus inactivation i e inactivation triggered by sunlight absorption by the virion without the role played by photochemically produced reactive intermediates generated by water dissolved photosensitizers on a global scale from 60 s to 60 n latitude and for the different months of the year the model is based on the equivalent monochromatic wavelength emw approach that was introduced recently and which largely simplifies complex polychromatic calculations by approximating them with a monochromatic equation at the proper wavelength the emw the emw equation was initially established for mid july conditions at a mid latitude and was then extended to different seasons and to the latitude belt where the day night cycle is always observed throughout the year by so doing the first order rate constant of direct virus photoinactivation can be predicted on a global scale with the use of a relatively simple equation plus tables of pre calculated input data as a function of latitude month and key water parameters the model was here applied to the virus organism phix174 a somatic phage that is often used as proxy for pathogenic viruses undergoing fast direct inactivation and for which a wide array of published inactivation data is available model predictions are validated by comparison with field data of inactivation of somatic phages by sunlight keywords water disinfection solar disinfection radiation modeling kinetic modeling direct photoprocesses 1 introduction the ability of sunlight to trigger the inactivation of bacteria and viruses occurring in water has been extensively studied in natural water systems kohn and nelson 2007 boehm et al 2009 love et al 2010 furthermore the same phenomenon has been exploited as a low cost option to obtain reasonably safe drinking water solar disinfection or sodis mcguigan et al 2012 and it may also give a contribution to the treatment of wastewater in waste stabilization ponds and constructed wetlands curtis et al 1994 silverman et al 2015 the action of sunlight on microorganisms takes place by two main pathways of which the first involves direct damage by sunlight photons to usually the genome direct endogenous inactivation nelson et al 2018 the second pathway requires sunlight absorption by photosensitizers occurring in water such as chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom nitrate and nitrite rosado lausell et al 2013 maraccini et al 2016 the absorption of sunlight by the photosensitizers triggers the formation of photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris such as singlet oxygen 1o2 hydroxyl radicals oh triplet states of cdom 3cdom and carbonate radicals co3 secondarily formed upon oxidation of hco3 and co3 2 by oh and of co3 2 by 3cdom vione et al 2014 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 mcneill and canonica 2016 these ppris can damage viruses and bacteria and lead to their inactivation maraccini et al 2016 nelson et al 2018 usually different organisms undergo different inactivation pathways to different extents in the case of bacteria there is also a further possibility named indirect endogenous inactivation where ppris are produced within the cell upon absorption of sunlight by photoactive cell constituents giannakis et al 2016 another difference that can occur between viruses and bacteria is that the former usually show first order photoinactivation kinetics mattle et al 2015 while the latter can sometimes repair photodamage at least up to a certain extent in this case it may be observed a lag time before the onset of exponential inactivation of bacteria giannakis et al 2018 which considerably complicates the kinetic description of photoinactivation serna galvis et al 2019 as far as the direct endogenous photoinactivation is concerned one important issue is that not all the wavelengths within sunlight have the same effect usually uvb radiation is most effective followed by uva and visible this phenomenon is often described by biological weighting functions or sunlight photoaction spectra which describe the wavelength dependent sensitivity to damage by sunlight fisher et al 2011 nguyen et al 2014 silverman et al 2019 the main reason for the existence of a photoaction spectrum is the fact that absorbance by the genome decreases with increasing wavelength at least in the range of wavelengths that is relevant to natural sunlight based on this consideration an alternative approach disentangles sunlight absorption by the genome from photon action mattle et al 2015 with a mathematical description that is very similar to the direct photolysis of molecules this approach has also led to successful modeling of the photoinactivation of viruses kohn et al 2016 an important difficulty with the modeling of photoinactivation is the polychromatic nature of the phenomenon this requires quite complex multi wavelength calculations and often the use of dedicated software to obtain inactivation kinetics as a function of the environmental conditions water chemistry depth sunlight irradiance and spectrum zhang et al 2020 the problem is that software may be seen as a black box that is difficult to customize by users and it is usually not conceived to solve all the problems that may arise in the virus inactivation field the same problems occur for the prediction of photodegradation of pollutants by sunlight vione 2020 in the latter context a recent advance to considerably simplify calculations has been the introduction of the so called equivalent monochromatic wavelengths or emw following the emw approach the polychromatic system is approximated by a much simpler monochromatic equation and the main issue becomes the identification of the single monochromatic wavelength the emw that ensures the best approximation excellent agreement has been observed between the emw based monochromatic equation and the multi wavelength one in the case of organic pollutants vione 2021 the first goal of this work was to verify whether the emw approach can be applied successfully to the direct photoinactivation of viruses we chose viruses instead of bacteria because the behavior of bacteria under sunlight is more complex and some processes still resist successful modeling serna galvis et al 2018 the rationale for choosing direct photoinactivation is that this process is always very significant and it allows for a single wavelength to be taken into account in calculations when using the emw approach vide infra indeed even the virus that is most often used as a proxy of indirect exogenous inactivation i e the bacteriophage ms2 kohn and nelson 2007 kohn et al 2007 nelson et al 2018 is inactivated significantly around 50 and sometimes even more by the direct process under a variety of environmental conditions kohn et al 2016 here we chose the somatic phage phix174 as a model virus because this virus undergoes almost exclusively the direct inactivation process nelson et al 2018 moreover phix174 has been studied extensively and sufficient data are available that allow for successful modeling mattle et al 2015 the relatively simple form of the emw equation is amenable to generalizations therefore the second goal of this work was to extend the modeling of virus inactivation initially carried out for a mid latitude mid july condition to all seasons and to a wide range of latitudes 60 s to 60 n by so doing it would be possible to predict the kinetics of virus photoinactivation on the basis of water chemistry and depth for any season and for a majority of locations on our planet the added value is that all this would be achieved with a relatively simple and easily manageable equation model predictions for the somatic phage phix174 were then validated against field data that are available for the photoinactivation of somatic phages in natural water where the direct photoinactivation process is presumed to play a very important role bohem et al 2009 the choice of direct photoinactivation was critical to limit calculations to a single wavelength and to obtain a proof of concept of the feasibility of this approach the emw approach can be extended to indirect photoinactivation as well vione 2021 and the global modeling of the indirect processes will be the subject of forthcoming work 2 methods 2 1 the emw approach to virus photoinactivation to describe the direct photoinactivation of viruses we used a formalism that is quite similar to that describing the direct photolysis of molecules instead of using the so called photoaction spectrum this formalism considers the absorption of radiation by the virus and the quantum yield of photoinactivation separately mattle et al 2015 because of the relatively narrow overlap between virus absorption and sunlight emission 300 320 nm the photoinactivation quantum yield can be considered constant kohn et al 2016 with this approach the first order rate constant of phix174 photoinactivation is obtained as eq 1 in mattle et al 2015 by using l units for volume m for water depth and referring the solution absorbance to unit dissolved organic carbon doc the mentioned equation in mattle et al 2015 takes a form that is similar to the equation describing the direct photolysis of pollutants in vione 2021 1 k d i r e c t 10 d p o λ φ ε λ τ a 1 λ d o c 1 10 100 a 1 λ d d o c d λ where k direct has day 1 units d is the water depth in meters m p λ einstein cm 2 s 1 nm 1 is a standard sunlight spectral photon flux density vide infra φ 1 4 10 2 mol einstein 1 the quantum yield of phix174 photoinactivation mattle et al 2015 ε λ m 1 cm 1 the molar absorption coefficient of phix174 see fig 1 τ s day 1 a conversion factor vide infra doc mgc l 1 the dissolved organic carbon of the water matrix natural water or wastewater and a 1 λ l mgc 1 cm 1 the absorbance of the water matrix referred to unit doc and to an optical path length of 1 cm note that 100 is the conversion factor between cm 1 and m 1 while 10 is the conversion factor between m 1 cm 2 and l 1 the total absorbance of the water column is a tot λ a 1 λ d doc which explains why water depth d appears at the denominator in eq 1 this is reasonable because the deeper is water the lower is k direct and photochemical reactions are slower in deeper waters that are less efficiently illuminated by sunlight vione et al 2014 kohn et al 2016 the chosen standard value of p λ corresponds to a sunlight uv irradiance 290 400 nm of 22 w m 2 see fig 1 which on a sunny 15 july at 45 n latitude can be observed at 9 am or 3 pm solar time solar noon 3 h of course such an irradiation condition is not constant during the day and the conversion factor τ 3 6 104 s day 1 takes into account the ratio between constant irradiation at p λ and actual sunlight intensity from sunrise to sunset vione 2020 integration of eq 1 is carried out over the wavelength range where absorption by the virus ε λ and sunlight emission p λ overlap with the above data k direct is obtained as the first order rate constant of phix174 photoinactivation on a fair weather 15 july at 45 n latitude eq 1 together with its derivations where p λ was modified in particular cases fall equinox to account for photoinactivation at different latitudes was found to predict well the behavior of phix174 under sunlight kohn et al 2016 it is interesting to observe that eq 1 contains all the main parameters that have been shown to affect the photoinactivation of viruses which is most affected by time and location which impact p λ doc and water depth zhang et al 2020 the current model does not take into account the effects of ph dissolved oxygen and temperature on virus inactivation these parameters were found to have limited effect on virus inactivation when varying in the typical ranges found in waste stabilization ponds and constructed wetlands maiga et al 2009 dias et al 2017 in contrast they would play an important role in the framework of the solar disinfection of drinking water sodis romero et al 2011 mcguigan et al 2012 carratalà et al 2016 garcía gil et al 2020a garcia gil et al 2020b altitude was also assessed to have limited impact on inactivation zhang et al 2020 most likely because of limited absorption by the virus at or below 300 nm fig 1 in the case of molecules it has been shown that the integral calculation based on eq 1 can be approximated very well with a much simpler monochromatic equation based on the equivalent monochromatic wavelength emw or λeq vione 2021 in the case of phix174 the corresponding monochromatic equation would read as follows 2 k dire ct 10 d p λ eq τ η app ε λ eq a 1 λ eq doc 1 10 100 a 1 λ eq d doc where some entries 10 d τ doc 100 are exactly the same as per eq 1 while others p λeq ε λeq a 1 λeq are referred to the single wavelength λeq instead of the wavelength range used for integration in eq 1 however the main mechanistic implications sunlight intensity virus absorption water absorption are the same in both cases and they are thus not lost in eq 2 as compared to eq 1 the main difference between the two equations is the replacement of the quantum yield φ of virus photoinactivation by the apparent photon efficiency η app nm mol einstein 1 η app φ compensates for the fact that eq 2 only considers sunlight absorption by the virus at λeq which is much smaller compared to cumulated absorption of radiation over a whole range of wavelengths vione 2021 however one needs to know φ for a certain virus in order to derive η app which means that the mechanistic information contained in φ cannot be ignored to verify whether eq 2 with the proper value of λeq can approximate eq 1 well the following procedure was followed vione 2021 i use eq 1 to produce data of k direct for different values of d and doc a good approximation for a 1 λ in several natural water matrices is a 1 λ 0 45 e 0 015 λ vione 2020 ii fit the data thus obtained with eq 2 while d doc and τ are kept fixed at the same values used for eq 1 in a first round p λeq ε λeq a 1 λeq and η app are all defined as free floating variables the key value is that of a 1 λeq because it defines the trend of k direct vs doc and is not affected by the values of the other variables therefore considering that a 1 λ 0 45 e 0 015 λ the value of a 1 λeq obtained by data fit allows for the identification of λeq 66 7 ln a 1 λeq 53 2 note that a 1 λeq 1 iii once λeq is obtained find the corresponding values of p λeq and ε λeq note that p λ and ε λ are reported in fig 1 to aid with similar cases the corresponding numerical values are also reported in table s1 of the supplementary material hereinafter sm at this stage with fixed p λeq ε λeq and a 1 λeq it is possible to fit the data with η app as the only free floating variable if the fit quality is good it can be concluded that the polychromatic system allows for a convenient emw approximation by using eq 2 with fixed values of p λeq ε λeq a 1 λeq and η app it is possible to predict k direct as a function of d and doc these are the most important water parameters as far as direct photoinactivation is concerned zhang et al 2020 indeed direct photoprocesses are faster at low d and low doc because i deep waters are poorly illuminated by sunlight and ii high doc usually means elevated cdom that competes with the virus for absorption of solar uv radiation if eq 2 approximates eq 1 well it can be used to predict the value of k direct on 15 july at 45 n latitude the given time and latitude depend on the choice of p λ and τ which are key issues to generalize the photochemical model to different seasons and latitudes 2 2 generalization of the emw equation apart from poorly predictable issues related to the weather the value of p λ mostly depends on the time of the day day of the year and latitude the problem is that variability is very large and the associated time interval quite short which may prevent a manageable equation to be obtained as already done in the case of eq 1 a possible way out of the problem is to consider a single spectrum of sunlight that is relevant to the period under consideration and to match it to the cumulated incident radiation in fair weather conditions g d a y max λ integral of p λ over a 1 day time units of einstein cm 2 day 1 nm 1 kalogirou 2013 note that max refers to the fact that sunny weather is initially assumed with different weather conditions lowering the cumulated incident radiation in the framework of the emw approximation g d a y max λ becomes the cumulated incident radiation at λeq g d a y max λ e q that can be calculated as follows 3 g d a y m a x λ e q 1 d a y p o λ e q t d t where p λeq t takes into account the variability of the spectral photon flux density of sunlight over the time t of the day the curve of p λeq t vs time that is to be integrated was obtained by using eqs s4 s5 in sm introducing the zenith angles obtained with the solar position algorithm spa from the national renewable energy laboratory nrel 2021 the curve was defined with 24 points i e one point for each hour of the day time step 3600 s as an approximation g d a y m a x λ e q is also given by the product of a single value of p λeq t such as the incident spectral photon flux density of sunlight at solar noon p s n o λ e q units of einstein cm 2 s 1 nm 1 times the day length τ dl the time in s from sunrise to sunset and times a proportionality factor f 1 unitless the factor f 1 expresses the relationship between the cumulated incident radiation and the daily dose if the solar photon flux density corresponds to the solar noon and is constant during the day length eq 4 4 g d a y m a x λ e q f 1 p s n o λ e q τ d l detailed procedure to determine the solar photon flux density at solar noon for the equivalent wavelength p s n o λ e q and the day length τdl can be found in the sm thus the g d a y max λ e q data were first computed with eq 3 for a latitude of 45 n considering the 15th day of each month these same g d a y max λ e q data were then optimized with eq 4 to obtain the proportionality factor f 1 minimizing the normalized root mean square error nrmse between the original data points eq 3 and those predicted by the fit function eq 4 optimization was carried out with microsoft excel solver in principle the value of f 1 obtained for φ 45 n might or might not be valid at different latitudes therefore a check was made by computing the values of g d a y max λ e q with eq 3 for the 15th day of each month at latitudes from 60 s to 60 n with steps of 5 then these data were compared with the predictions obtained with eq 4 using p s n o λ e q as per eq s6 τ d l as per eq s7 and the value of f 1 obtained from the previous fit φ 45 n by replacing the term p λeq τ in eq 2 with the term f 1 p s n o λ e q τ d l as per the above discussion the first order rate constants for phix174 direct photoinactivation are obtained in different months within the whole latitude belt from 60 s to 60 n this practically includes all of the world s regions where it makes sense to use sunlight to inactivate viruses as well as the whole continental mainland of the southern hemisphere except the antarctica the only issue is that this calculated value of k direct refers to fair weather conditions a further approach was thus used to take average weather conditions into account to do so a new parameter f 2 was introduced as a cloud cover factor so that g d a y r e a l λ e q f 2 g d a y max λ e q and therefore 5 g d a y r e a l λ e q f 2 f 1 p s n o λ e q τ d l the value of f 2 is variable even for the same location and day of the year since it depends on the weather conditions this parameter can be calculated experimentally or estimated using historical data it is strongly recommended to measure the actual irradiance in the field and calculate f2 by dividing the experimental value by the theoretical value however if actual measurements are not available f 2 can be estimated using historical data according to the procedure described by moreno sansegundo et al 2021 this tool calculates the cumulated radiation by applying a cloud cover factor based on the historical data of the last 12 years with a grid of 0 5 in latitude and longitude the developed code is openly available at the github and zenodo repositories moreno sansegundo et al 2021 the values of f 2 as a function of the latitude and longitude geocoordinates are available in the excel file f2 xlsx provided as sm the value of f 2 allows for modifying eq 2 as follows 6 k dire ct 10 d f 2 f 1 p sn o λ eq τ dl η app ε λ eq a 1 λ eq doc 1 10 100 a 1 λ eq d doc eq 6 is an estimate of k direct under realistic weather conditions it should be remarked that all the procedure leading to the elaboration of eq 6 was hugely simplified by the possibility to operate at a single wavelength instead of a range of wavelengths this is enabled by the emw approach which also allows for eventually obtaining a relatively simple equation that does not require numerical integration to be solved this model was validated in two different ways with literature data firstly the cumulated incident radiation was compared with data of average sunlight spectra available from 8 00 to 16 00 h solar time at a latitude of 52 n frank and klöpffer 1988 briefly the cumulated incident radiation was obtained following g d a y r e a l λ e q f 2 g d a y max λ e q on the one hand g d a y max λ e q was calculated with eq 3 for the 15th day of each month carrying out integration over time from 8 00 h to 16 00 h again the p λeq vs time curve was obtained using eqs s4 s5 with φ 52 n and by introducing the zenith angles obtained from nrel 2021 the curve was defined with 8 points i e one point per hour 8 00 16 00 h time step 3600 s on the other hand f 2 was obtained for 52 n latitude and 5 e longitude using the excel file f2 xlsx provided as sm secondly eq 6 was used to assess published field data of virus photoinactivation in particular boehm et al 2009 studied the photoinactivation rate constants of somatic phages measured in a lagoon in avalon bay california 20th 23rd august latitude 33 n and suggested that direct photoinactivation would play an important role key water conditions were 15 cm water depth and 7 mgc l 1 doc the disinfection kinetic constant predicted with our model for direct photoinactivation of the somatic phage phix174 was compared with the observed disinfection kinetic constant that has been determined as 28 day 1 iuvb 1 where iuvb is the irradiance of sunlight in the uvb region boehm et al 2009 the parameter f 2 for eq 6 was obtained as usual with the f2 xlsx file provided in the sm for 33 n latitude and 118 e longitude 3 results and discussion 3 1 emw approximation of photoinactivation kinetics the values of k direct for phix174 as a function of doc and water depth d were first calculated with eq 1 using the values of p λ sunlight spectrum and ε λ virus absorption shown in fig 1 with φ 1 4 10 2 mol einstein 1 mattle et al 2015 and a 1 λ 0 45 e 0 015 λ vione 2020 the results of the relevant calculations are reported as solid squares in fig 2 the dashes curves represent data fit with eq 2 using η app as the only free floating variable after finding λeq 307 5 nm on this basis it was possible to fix p 307 5 nm 4 04 10 12 einstein cm 2 s 1 nm 1 ε 307 5 nm 3 45 105 m 1 cm 1 and a 1 307 5 nm 0 00447 l mgc 1 cm 1 with these parameter values data fit returned η app 0 203 nm mol einstein 1 the excellent agreement between the k direct data obtained with eq 1 and with eq 2 suggests that the emw approximation can be applied well to the direct photoinactivation of phix174 it is not surprising to find λeq 307 5 nm when considering the absorption spectrum of phix174 ε λ which is similar to that of many viral genomes and the spectral photon flux density of sunlight p λ fig 1 the two spectra overlap in a rather narrow interval in the uvb region and the product p λ ε λ that appears in eqs 1 2 shows a maximum that is quite near the value of λeq considering that depth and doc are the main water parameters affecting virus inactivation zhang et al 2020 the variation ranges shown in fig 2 cover the majority of scenarios where solar inactivation can be taken advantage of in ponds and wetlands the very good agreement between eqs 1 and 2 once the appropriate values of λeq and η app are found suggests that the monochromatic approximation does not cause loss of generality in the photochemical model the emw approximation does not take into account the effects of vegetation and water body hydrology but these effects are not considered in eq 1 as well however if they translate into a numerical factor these can be easily included in both eqs 1 and 2 3 2 kinetic predictions as a function of latitude and the day of the year 3 2 1 maximum fair weather daily dose using the photon flux density of sunlight at solar noon determination of f1 the maximum daily dose g d a y max λ e q was first calculated with eq 3 and the results of the calculations are shown as solid squares in fig 3 then these data were used for optimization with eq 4 the term f 1 in eq 4 was optimized for a latitude of 45 n at λeq 307 5 nm and it took a value of 0 43 with a nrmse of 1 the value of f 1 thus obtained means that the average photon flux density of sunlight during the whole day length is 43 of the photon flux density peak at the solar noon p s n o λ e q see eq 4 the excellent data fit suggests that this value of f 1 referred to fair weather conditions at 45 n is consistent during the year the next step consists in verifying if the value of f 1 depends on the latitude or if in contrast f 1 0 43 obtained at φ 45 n can be generalized to do so f 1 was validated with predictions of the cumulated radiation for latitudes from 60 s to 60 n with a step of 5 the solid symbols reported in fig 4 represent the cumulated radiation g d a y max 307 5 nm referred to the 15th day of each month and calculated by integration using eq 3 the curves represent the predictions obtained with eq 4 by using f 1 0 43 all the predictions showed a very good agreement with the eq 3 data with errors of less than 13 for latitudes between 55 s 55 n and 22 18 for 60 s and 60 n respectively this result means that a constant value f 1 0 43 can be used over the whole year in the whole latitude belt from 60 s to 60 n replacing the term p λeq τ in eq 2 with the term f 1 p s n o λ e q τ d l from eq 4 leads to the first order rate constants for phix174 direct photoinactivation in different months for φ 60 s 60 n however this approach only predicts virus photoinactivation kinetics in fair weather conditions which could overestimate the actual kinetics of inactivation by sunlight therefore f 2 was added to account for the cloudiness and the effect on the irradiance that reaches the earth s surface the next section presents the validation of the eq 6 model against literature data 3 2 2 realistic values of cumulated incident radiation determination of f2 the approximated eq 4 predicts well the maximum cumulated incident radiation g d a y max 307 5 nm for varying latitude and season but it does not include atmosphere or cloud cover effects in order to estimate a more realistic daily dose the factor f 2 was calculated based on graphic data shown in fig 5 or the tabulated data in the f2 xlsx file provided as sm to evaluate the accuracy of f2 predictions for the cumulated incident radiation from 8 00 to 16 00 h at 52 n latitude calculated with eq 5 obtained from eq 4 by multiplying for the f 2 factor were compared to data from the literature frank and klöpffer 1988 in the cited paper frank and klöpffer reported average radiation intensity referred to the time interval of solar noon 4 h to obtain the measured cumulated incident radiation these values were multiplied by δt 28 800 s i e the time interval from 8 00 to 16 00 h f 2 took a value of 0 58 latitude 52 longitude 5 similar values 57 have been experimentally found at a latitude of 40 3 n at madrid spain garcía gil et al 2019 fig 6 shows a good agreement between the predicted and literature data when using the estimated value of f 2 based on historical weather data which reduces the nrmse from 121 for f2 1 to 25 5 for f2 0 58 therefore an approach based on historical data of the weather considerably improves the prediction with respect to the assumption of fair weather conditions 3 3 implications for the modeling of direct virus photoinactivation upon introduction of the new parameter f 2 eq 6 allows for the calculation of the kinetic constant for the direct photoinactivation of the virus phix174 moreover considering that g d a y max λ e q f 1 p s n o λ e q τ d l eq 4 a more compact form for the same equation becomes the following 7 k dire ct 10 d f 2 g day max λ eq η app ε λ eq a 1 λ eq doc 1 10 100 a 1 λ eq d doc where λeq 307 5 nm η app 0 203 nm mol einstein 1 ε 307 5 nm 3 45 105 m 1 cm 1 and a 1 307 5 nm 0 00447 l mgc 1 cm 1 the values of f 2 can be obtained from the latitude and longitude geocoordinates using fig 5 or the f2 xlsx file provided as sm the calculated values for g d a y max 307 5 nm are reported in table 1 for latitudes between 60 s and 60 n with a step of 5 and for the 15th day of each month eq 7 with these data allows for the calculation of k direct for phix174 at different latitudes and seasons for different values of doc and d if additional data of g d a y max 307 5 nm are needed for other latitudes between 60 s and 60 n or days they can be calculated with eq 4 by considering that the values of photon flux density at solar noon p s n o 307 5 nm were obtained with eq s6 as a function of month and latitude while the values of τ dl were obtained with eq s7 eq 7 takes into account all the main parameters that have been shown to affect the photoinactivation of viruses irradiance doc and water depth moreover this equation also accounts for the effect of latitude and season on the first order kinetic constant through the irradiance g d a y max according to eqs s1 s7 for latitudes close to the equator g d a y max remains almost constant whereas for higher latitudes τ dl and p s n o increase in summer and decrease in winter fig 4 the same trend applies to the first order kinetic constant which is directly proportional to g d a y max however the value of f2 cannot be predictively calculated based exclusively on the latitude and the day of the year because it depends on the weather conditions for example for the republic of congo a high value of the kinetic constant would be expected according to its location at the equator however the high probability of cloud cover based on historical weather data leads to a significantly lower expected kinetic constant in this region fig 5 the ultimate goal of the present study is to use the model thus obtained to predict virus inactivation in the field to test the feasibility of this approach predictions by eq 7 were compared with field data of photoinduced virus inactivation the field results of boehm et al 2009 were taken into account that refer to the presumably mostly direct according to the authors photoinactivation of somatic phages with an overall behavior that has reasonable analogies with the direct photoinactivation of the somatic phage phix174 the cited authors found a maximal photoinactivation rate of somatic phages of 28 day 1 iuvb 1 in avalon bay california late august 33 n latitude 0 15 m water depth 7 mgc l 1 doc in order to compare this measurement with our model prediction it was necessary to assess the value of iuvb that was obtained by using smarts the same procedure used by the authors giving an average value of 0 41 w m 2 that agrees with the published data see fig 2 of boehm et al 2009 by so doing the field kinetic constant was calculated as 11 54 day 1 f 2 took a value of 0 82 latitude 33 longitude 118 our model prediction with eq 7 for phix174 is k direct 9 8 day 1 the error value of 15 looks more than reasonable if considering that the phages in the paper by bohem et al 2009 were not identical to those considered in our model and that indirect photoinactivation by most notably 1o2 could not be totally excluded bohem et al 2009 other differences between the model prediction and the field system include the high ionic strength and the presence of halide species in the marine environment these factors have previously been found to enhance the photoinactivation of viruses sinton et al 2002 another possibility is the occurrence of consistent sunny weather during the field study which took place during summer for very bright and sunny regions the value of f 2 is around 90 moreno sansegundo et al 2021 and if eq 7 is recalculated with f 2 0 9 instead of f 2 0 82 k direct 10 8 day 1 is obtained that is not far from the field datum note that a deactivation constant k direct 11 day 1 translates into a virus half life time t 1 2 1 5 h as an average value from 8 00 h to 16 00 h in the same 8 h time period sunlight would thus be able to inactivate 97 5 of the viruses that were initially present although this does not make complete disinfection it would certainly help reduce the viral load in water 4 conclusions here we propose a relatively simple procedure to estimate the kinetic constant for the direct photoinactivation of the somatic phage phix174 which is a typical model organism for the viruses that mainly undergo inactivation by the direct action of sunlight the procedure is based on an approximated equation for monochromatic light absorption which relies on the identification of the equivalent monochromatic wavelength that best simulates the behavior of the polychromatic system the main advantage of this approach is to obtain a simple and manageable equation eq 7 to easily predict inactivation kinetics with no need to use external and complex software predictions were quite good in the case of somatic phages undergoing direct photoinactivation in the field to extend the model to other types of viruses the corresponding values of φ and ε λ are required the simplicity of the procedure leads to a few limitations that do not really compromise its usefulness for example for latitudes in which there is no sunrise or sunset in some seasons this procedure is not applicable because τ d l cannot be calculated with eq s7 however in these latitudes below 60 s and above 60 n the incident radiation received is not enough to take advantage of a sunlight mediated process the most significant limitation is probably the fact that considering average weather with the f 2 parameter would not fit well periods with consistently fine or bad weather however this is a handicap that more complex software based polychromatic approaches would not solve either declaration of competing interest the authors

16462,sunlight plays an important role in the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses in water here we present a model that is able to predict the kinetics of direct virus inactivation i e inactivation triggered by sunlight absorption by the virion without the role played by photochemically produced reactive intermediates generated by water dissolved photosensitizers on a global scale from 60 s to 60 n latitude and for the different months of the year the model is based on the equivalent monochromatic wavelength emw approach that was introduced recently and which largely simplifies complex polychromatic calculations by approximating them with a monochromatic equation at the proper wavelength the emw the emw equation was initially established for mid july conditions at a mid latitude and was then extended to different seasons and to the latitude belt where the day night cycle is always observed throughout the year by so doing the first order rate constant of direct virus photoinactivation can be predicted on a global scale with the use of a relatively simple equation plus tables of pre calculated input data as a function of latitude month and key water parameters the model was here applied to the virus organism phix174 a somatic phage that is often used as proxy for pathogenic viruses undergoing fast direct inactivation and for which a wide array of published inactivation data is available model predictions are validated by comparison with field data of inactivation of somatic phages by sunlight keywords water disinfection solar disinfection radiation modeling kinetic modeling direct photoprocesses 1 introduction the ability of sunlight to trigger the inactivation of bacteria and viruses occurring in water has been extensively studied in natural water systems kohn and nelson 2007 boehm et al 2009 love et al 2010 furthermore the same phenomenon has been exploited as a low cost option to obtain reasonably safe drinking water solar disinfection or sodis mcguigan et al 2012 and it may also give a contribution to the treatment of wastewater in waste stabilization ponds and constructed wetlands curtis et al 1994 silverman et al 2015 the action of sunlight on microorganisms takes place by two main pathways of which the first involves direct damage by sunlight photons to usually the genome direct endogenous inactivation nelson et al 2018 the second pathway requires sunlight absorption by photosensitizers occurring in water such as chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom nitrate and nitrite rosado lausell et al 2013 maraccini et al 2016 the absorption of sunlight by the photosensitizers triggers the formation of photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris such as singlet oxygen 1o2 hydroxyl radicals oh triplet states of cdom 3cdom and carbonate radicals co3 secondarily formed upon oxidation of hco3 and co3 2 by oh and of co3 2 by 3cdom vione et al 2014 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 mcneill and canonica 2016 these ppris can damage viruses and bacteria and lead to their inactivation maraccini et al 2016 nelson et al 2018 usually different organisms undergo different inactivation pathways to different extents in the case of bacteria there is also a further possibility named indirect endogenous inactivation where ppris are produced within the cell upon absorption of sunlight by photoactive cell constituents giannakis et al 2016 another difference that can occur between viruses and bacteria is that the former usually show first order photoinactivation kinetics mattle et al 2015 while the latter can sometimes repair photodamage at least up to a certain extent in this case it may be observed a lag time before the onset of exponential inactivation of bacteria giannakis et al 2018 which considerably complicates the kinetic description of photoinactivation serna galvis et al 2019 as far as the direct endogenous photoinactivation is concerned one important issue is that not all the wavelengths within sunlight have the same effect usually uvb radiation is most effective followed by uva and visible this phenomenon is often described by biological weighting functions or sunlight photoaction spectra which describe the wavelength dependent sensitivity to damage by sunlight fisher et al 2011 nguyen et al 2014 silverman et al 2019 the main reason for the existence of a photoaction spectrum is the fact that absorbance by the genome decreases with increasing wavelength at least in the range of wavelengths that is relevant to natural sunlight based on this consideration an alternative approach disentangles sunlight absorption by the genome from photon action mattle et al 2015 with a mathematical description that is very similar to the direct photolysis of molecules this approach has also led to successful modeling of the photoinactivation of viruses kohn et al 2016 an important difficulty with the modeling of photoinactivation is the polychromatic nature of the phenomenon this requires quite complex multi wavelength calculations and often the use of dedicated software to obtain inactivation kinetics as a function of the environmental conditions water chemistry depth sunlight irradiance and spectrum zhang et al 2020 the problem is that software may be seen as a black box that is difficult to customize by users and it is usually not conceived to solve all the problems that may arise in the virus inactivation field the same problems occur for the prediction of photodegradation of pollutants by sunlight vione 2020 in the latter context a recent advance to considerably simplify calculations has been the introduction of the so called equivalent monochromatic wavelengths or emw following the emw approach the polychromatic system is approximated by a much simpler monochromatic equation and the main issue becomes the identification of the single monochromatic wavelength the emw that ensures the best approximation excellent agreement has been observed between the emw based monochromatic equation and the multi wavelength one in the case of organic pollutants vione 2021 the first goal of this work was to verify whether the emw approach can be applied successfully to the direct photoinactivation of viruses we chose viruses instead of bacteria because the behavior of bacteria under sunlight is more complex and some processes still resist successful modeling serna galvis et al 2018 the rationale for choosing direct photoinactivation is that this process is always very significant and it allows for a single wavelength to be taken into account in calculations when using the emw approach vide infra indeed even the virus that is most often used as a proxy of indirect exogenous inactivation i e the bacteriophage ms2 kohn and nelson 2007 kohn et al 2007 nelson et al 2018 is inactivated significantly around 50 and sometimes even more by the direct process under a variety of environmental conditions kohn et al 2016 here we chose the somatic phage phix174 as a model virus because this virus undergoes almost exclusively the direct inactivation process nelson et al 2018 moreover phix174 has been studied extensively and sufficient data are available that allow for successful modeling mattle et al 2015 the relatively simple form of the emw equation is amenable to generalizations therefore the second goal of this work was to extend the modeling of virus inactivation initially carried out for a mid latitude mid july condition to all seasons and to a wide range of latitudes 60 s to 60 n by so doing it would be possible to predict the kinetics of virus photoinactivation on the basis of water chemistry and depth for any season and for a majority of locations on our planet the added value is that all this would be achieved with a relatively simple and easily manageable equation model predictions for the somatic phage phix174 were then validated against field data that are available for the photoinactivation of somatic phages in natural water where the direct photoinactivation process is presumed to play a very important role bohem et al 2009 the choice of direct photoinactivation was critical to limit calculations to a single wavelength and to obtain a proof of concept of the feasibility of this approach the emw approach can be extended to indirect photoinactivation as well vione 2021 and the global modeling of the indirect processes will be the subject of forthcoming work 2 methods 2 1 the emw approach to virus photoinactivation to describe the direct photoinactivation of viruses we used a formalism that is quite similar to that describing the direct photolysis of molecules instead of using the so called photoaction spectrum this formalism considers the absorption of radiation by the virus and the quantum yield of photoinactivation separately mattle et al 2015 because of the relatively narrow overlap between virus absorption and sunlight emission 300 320 nm the photoinactivation quantum yield can be considered constant kohn et al 2016 with this approach the first order rate constant of phix174 photoinactivation is obtained as eq 1 in mattle et al 2015 by using l units for volume m for water depth and referring the solution absorbance to unit dissolved organic carbon doc the mentioned equation in mattle et al 2015 takes a form that is similar to the equation describing the direct photolysis of pollutants in vione 2021 1 k d i r e c t 10 d p o λ φ ε λ τ a 1 λ d o c 1 10 100 a 1 λ d d o c d λ where k direct has day 1 units d is the water depth in meters m p λ einstein cm 2 s 1 nm 1 is a standard sunlight spectral photon flux density vide infra φ 1 4 10 2 mol einstein 1 the quantum yield of phix174 photoinactivation mattle et al 2015 ε λ m 1 cm 1 the molar absorption coefficient of phix174 see fig 1 τ s day 1 a conversion factor vide infra doc mgc l 1 the dissolved organic carbon of the water matrix natural water or wastewater and a 1 λ l mgc 1 cm 1 the absorbance of the water matrix referred to unit doc and to an optical path length of 1 cm note that 100 is the conversion factor between cm 1 and m 1 while 10 is the conversion factor between m 1 cm 2 and l 1 the total absorbance of the water column is a tot λ a 1 λ d doc which explains why water depth d appears at the denominator in eq 1 this is reasonable because the deeper is water the lower is k direct and photochemical reactions are slower in deeper waters that are less efficiently illuminated by sunlight vione et al 2014 kohn et al 2016 the chosen standard value of p λ corresponds to a sunlight uv irradiance 290 400 nm of 22 w m 2 see fig 1 which on a sunny 15 july at 45 n latitude can be observed at 9 am or 3 pm solar time solar noon 3 h of course such an irradiation condition is not constant during the day and the conversion factor τ 3 6 104 s day 1 takes into account the ratio between constant irradiation at p λ and actual sunlight intensity from sunrise to sunset vione 2020 integration of eq 1 is carried out over the wavelength range where absorption by the virus ε λ and sunlight emission p λ overlap with the above data k direct is obtained as the first order rate constant of phix174 photoinactivation on a fair weather 15 july at 45 n latitude eq 1 together with its derivations where p λ was modified in particular cases fall equinox to account for photoinactivation at different latitudes was found to predict well the behavior of phix174 under sunlight kohn et al 2016 it is interesting to observe that eq 1 contains all the main parameters that have been shown to affect the photoinactivation of viruses which is most affected by time and location which impact p λ doc and water depth zhang et al 2020 the current model does not take into account the effects of ph dissolved oxygen and temperature on virus inactivation these parameters were found to have limited effect on virus inactivation when varying in the typical ranges found in waste stabilization ponds and constructed wetlands maiga et al 2009 dias et al 2017 in contrast they would play an important role in the framework of the solar disinfection of drinking water sodis romero et al 2011 mcguigan et al 2012 carratalà et al 2016 garcía gil et al 2020a garcia gil et al 2020b altitude was also assessed to have limited impact on inactivation zhang et al 2020 most likely because of limited absorption by the virus at or below 300 nm fig 1 in the case of molecules it has been shown that the integral calculation based on eq 1 can be approximated very well with a much simpler monochromatic equation based on the equivalent monochromatic wavelength emw or λeq vione 2021 in the case of phix174 the corresponding monochromatic equation would read as follows 2 k dire ct 10 d p λ eq τ η app ε λ eq a 1 λ eq doc 1 10 100 a 1 λ eq d doc where some entries 10 d τ doc 100 are exactly the same as per eq 1 while others p λeq ε λeq a 1 λeq are referred to the single wavelength λeq instead of the wavelength range used for integration in eq 1 however the main mechanistic implications sunlight intensity virus absorption water absorption are the same in both cases and they are thus not lost in eq 2 as compared to eq 1 the main difference between the two equations is the replacement of the quantum yield φ of virus photoinactivation by the apparent photon efficiency η app nm mol einstein 1 η app φ compensates for the fact that eq 2 only considers sunlight absorption by the virus at λeq which is much smaller compared to cumulated absorption of radiation over a whole range of wavelengths vione 2021 however one needs to know φ for a certain virus in order to derive η app which means that the mechanistic information contained in φ cannot be ignored to verify whether eq 2 with the proper value of λeq can approximate eq 1 well the following procedure was followed vione 2021 i use eq 1 to produce data of k direct for different values of d and doc a good approximation for a 1 λ in several natural water matrices is a 1 λ 0 45 e 0 015 λ vione 2020 ii fit the data thus obtained with eq 2 while d doc and τ are kept fixed at the same values used for eq 1 in a first round p λeq ε λeq a 1 λeq and η app are all defined as free floating variables the key value is that of a 1 λeq because it defines the trend of k direct vs doc and is not affected by the values of the other variables therefore considering that a 1 λ 0 45 e 0 015 λ the value of a 1 λeq obtained by data fit allows for the identification of λeq 66 7 ln a 1 λeq 53 2 note that a 1 λeq 1 iii once λeq is obtained find the corresponding values of p λeq and ε λeq note that p λ and ε λ are reported in fig 1 to aid with similar cases the corresponding numerical values are also reported in table s1 of the supplementary material hereinafter sm at this stage with fixed p λeq ε λeq and a 1 λeq it is possible to fit the data with η app as the only free floating variable if the fit quality is good it can be concluded that the polychromatic system allows for a convenient emw approximation by using eq 2 with fixed values of p λeq ε λeq a 1 λeq and η app it is possible to predict k direct as a function of d and doc these are the most important water parameters as far as direct photoinactivation is concerned zhang et al 2020 indeed direct photoprocesses are faster at low d and low doc because i deep waters are poorly illuminated by sunlight and ii high doc usually means elevated cdom that competes with the virus for absorption of solar uv radiation if eq 2 approximates eq 1 well it can be used to predict the value of k direct on 15 july at 45 n latitude the given time and latitude depend on the choice of p λ and τ which are key issues to generalize the photochemical model to different seasons and latitudes 2 2 generalization of the emw equation apart from poorly predictable issues related to the weather the value of p λ mostly depends on the time of the day day of the year and latitude the problem is that variability is very large and the associated time interval quite short which may prevent a manageable equation to be obtained as already done in the case of eq 1 a possible way out of the problem is to consider a single spectrum of sunlight that is relevant to the period under consideration and to match it to the cumulated incident radiation in fair weather conditions g d a y max λ integral of p λ over a 1 day time units of einstein cm 2 day 1 nm 1 kalogirou 2013 note that max refers to the fact that sunny weather is initially assumed with different weather conditions lowering the cumulated incident radiation in the framework of the emw approximation g d a y max λ becomes the cumulated incident radiation at λeq g d a y max λ e q that can be calculated as follows 3 g d a y m a x λ e q 1 d a y p o λ e q t d t where p λeq t takes into account the variability of the spectral photon flux density of sunlight over the time t of the day the curve of p λeq t vs time that is to be integrated was obtained by using eqs s4 s5 in sm introducing the zenith angles obtained with the solar position algorithm spa from the national renewable energy laboratory nrel 2021 the curve was defined with 24 points i e one point for each hour of the day time step 3600 s as an approximation g d a y m a x λ e q is also given by the product of a single value of p λeq t such as the incident spectral photon flux density of sunlight at solar noon p s n o λ e q units of einstein cm 2 s 1 nm 1 times the day length τ dl the time in s from sunrise to sunset and times a proportionality factor f 1 unitless the factor f 1 expresses the relationship between the cumulated incident radiation and the daily dose if the solar photon flux density corresponds to the solar noon and is constant during the day length eq 4 4 g d a y m a x λ e q f 1 p s n o λ e q τ d l detailed procedure to determine the solar photon flux density at solar noon for the equivalent wavelength p s n o λ e q and the day length τdl can be found in the sm thus the g d a y max λ e q data were first computed with eq 3 for a latitude of 45 n considering the 15th day of each month these same g d a y max λ e q data were then optimized with eq 4 to obtain the proportionality factor f 1 minimizing the normalized root mean square error nrmse between the original data points eq 3 and those predicted by the fit function eq 4 optimization was carried out with microsoft excel solver in principle the value of f 1 obtained for φ 45 n might or might not be valid at different latitudes therefore a check was made by computing the values of g d a y max λ e q with eq 3 for the 15th day of each month at latitudes from 60 s to 60 n with steps of 5 then these data were compared with the predictions obtained with eq 4 using p s n o λ e q as per eq s6 τ d l as per eq s7 and the value of f 1 obtained from the previous fit φ 45 n by replacing the term p λeq τ in eq 2 with the term f 1 p s n o λ e q τ d l as per the above discussion the first order rate constants for phix174 direct photoinactivation are obtained in different months within the whole latitude belt from 60 s to 60 n this practically includes all of the world s regions where it makes sense to use sunlight to inactivate viruses as well as the whole continental mainland of the southern hemisphere except the antarctica the only issue is that this calculated value of k direct refers to fair weather conditions a further approach was thus used to take average weather conditions into account to do so a new parameter f 2 was introduced as a cloud cover factor so that g d a y r e a l λ e q f 2 g d a y max λ e q and therefore 5 g d a y r e a l λ e q f 2 f 1 p s n o λ e q τ d l the value of f 2 is variable even for the same location and day of the year since it depends on the weather conditions this parameter can be calculated experimentally or estimated using historical data it is strongly recommended to measure the actual irradiance in the field and calculate f2 by dividing the experimental value by the theoretical value however if actual measurements are not available f 2 can be estimated using historical data according to the procedure described by moreno sansegundo et al 2021 this tool calculates the cumulated radiation by applying a cloud cover factor based on the historical data of the last 12 years with a grid of 0 5 in latitude and longitude the developed code is openly available at the github and zenodo repositories moreno sansegundo et al 2021 the values of f 2 as a function of the latitude and longitude geocoordinates are available in the excel file f2 xlsx provided as sm the value of f 2 allows for modifying eq 2 as follows 6 k dire ct 10 d f 2 f 1 p sn o λ eq τ dl η app ε λ eq a 1 λ eq doc 1 10 100 a 1 λ eq d doc eq 6 is an estimate of k direct under realistic weather conditions it should be remarked that all the procedure leading to the elaboration of eq 6 was hugely simplified by the possibility to operate at a single wavelength instead of a range of wavelengths this is enabled by the emw approach which also allows for eventually obtaining a relatively simple equation that does not require numerical integration to be solved this model was validated in two different ways with literature data firstly the cumulated incident radiation was compared with data of average sunlight spectra available from 8 00 to 16 00 h solar time at a latitude of 52 n frank and klöpffer 1988 briefly the cumulated incident radiation was obtained following g d a y r e a l λ e q f 2 g d a y max λ e q on the one hand g d a y max λ e q was calculated with eq 3 for the 15th day of each month carrying out integration over time from 8 00 h to 16 00 h again the p λeq vs time curve was obtained using eqs s4 s5 with φ 52 n and by introducing the zenith angles obtained from nrel 2021 the curve was defined with 8 points i e one point per hour 8 00 16 00 h time step 3600 s on the other hand f 2 was obtained for 52 n latitude and 5 e longitude using the excel file f2 xlsx provided as sm secondly eq 6 was used to assess published field data of virus photoinactivation in particular boehm et al 2009 studied the photoinactivation rate constants of somatic phages measured in a lagoon in avalon bay california 20th 23rd august latitude 33 n and suggested that direct photoinactivation would play an important role key water conditions were 15 cm water depth and 7 mgc l 1 doc the disinfection kinetic constant predicted with our model for direct photoinactivation of the somatic phage phix174 was compared with the observed disinfection kinetic constant that has been determined as 28 day 1 iuvb 1 where iuvb is the irradiance of sunlight in the uvb region boehm et al 2009 the parameter f 2 for eq 6 was obtained as usual with the f2 xlsx file provided in the sm for 33 n latitude and 118 e longitude 3 results and discussion 3 1 emw approximation of photoinactivation kinetics the values of k direct for phix174 as a function of doc and water depth d were first calculated with eq 1 using the values of p λ sunlight spectrum and ε λ virus absorption shown in fig 1 with φ 1 4 10 2 mol einstein 1 mattle et al 2015 and a 1 λ 0 45 e 0 015 λ vione 2020 the results of the relevant calculations are reported as solid squares in fig 2 the dashes curves represent data fit with eq 2 using η app as the only free floating variable after finding λeq 307 5 nm on this basis it was possible to fix p 307 5 nm 4 04 10 12 einstein cm 2 s 1 nm 1 ε 307 5 nm 3 45 105 m 1 cm 1 and a 1 307 5 nm 0 00447 l mgc 1 cm 1 with these parameter values data fit returned η app 0 203 nm mol einstein 1 the excellent agreement between the k direct data obtained with eq 1 and with eq 2 suggests that the emw approximation can be applied well to the direct photoinactivation of phix174 it is not surprising to find λeq 307 5 nm when considering the absorption spectrum of phix174 ε λ which is similar to that of many viral genomes and the spectral photon flux density of sunlight p λ fig 1 the two spectra overlap in a rather narrow interval in the uvb region and the product p λ ε λ that appears in eqs 1 2 shows a maximum that is quite near the value of λeq considering that depth and doc are the main water parameters affecting virus inactivation zhang et al 2020 the variation ranges shown in fig 2 cover the majority of scenarios where solar inactivation can be taken advantage of in ponds and wetlands the very good agreement between eqs 1 and 2 once the appropriate values of λeq and η app are found suggests that the monochromatic approximation does not cause loss of generality in the photochemical model the emw approximation does not take into account the effects of vegetation and water body hydrology but these effects are not considered in eq 1 as well however if they translate into a numerical factor these can be easily included in both eqs 1 and 2 3 2 kinetic predictions as a function of latitude and the day of the year 3 2 1 maximum fair weather daily dose using the photon flux density of sunlight at solar noon determination of f1 the maximum daily dose g d a y max λ e q was first calculated with eq 3 and the results of the calculations are shown as solid squares in fig 3 then these data were used for optimization with eq 4 the term f 1 in eq 4 was optimized for a latitude of 45 n at λeq 307 5 nm and it took a value of 0 43 with a nrmse of 1 the value of f 1 thus obtained means that the average photon flux density of sunlight during the whole day length is 43 of the photon flux density peak at the solar noon p s n o λ e q see eq 4 the excellent data fit suggests that this value of f 1 referred to fair weather conditions at 45 n is consistent during the year the next step consists in verifying if the value of f 1 depends on the latitude or if in contrast f 1 0 43 obtained at φ 45 n can be generalized to do so f 1 was validated with predictions of the cumulated radiation for latitudes from 60 s to 60 n with a step of 5 the solid symbols reported in fig 4 represent the cumulated radiation g d a y max 307 5 nm referred to the 15th day of each month and calculated by integration using eq 3 the curves represent the predictions obtained with eq 4 by using f 1 0 43 all the predictions showed a very good agreement with the eq 3 data with errors of less than 13 for latitudes between 55 s 55 n and 22 18 for 60 s and 60 n respectively this result means that a constant value f 1 0 43 can be used over the whole year in the whole latitude belt from 60 s to 60 n replacing the term p λeq τ in eq 2 with the term f 1 p s n o λ e q τ d l from eq 4 leads to the first order rate constants for phix174 direct photoinactivation in different months for φ 60 s 60 n however this approach only predicts virus photoinactivation kinetics in fair weather conditions which could overestimate the actual kinetics of inactivation by sunlight therefore f 2 was added to account for the cloudiness and the effect on the irradiance that reaches the earth s surface the next section presents the validation of the eq 6 model against literature data 3 2 2 realistic values of cumulated incident radiation determination of f2 the approximated eq 4 predicts well the maximum cumulated incident radiation g d a y max 307 5 nm for varying latitude and season but it does not include atmosphere or cloud cover effects in order to estimate a more realistic daily dose the factor f 2 was calculated based on graphic data shown in fig 5 or the tabulated data in the f2 xlsx file provided as sm to evaluate the accuracy of f2 predictions for the cumulated incident radiation from 8 00 to 16 00 h at 52 n latitude calculated with eq 5 obtained from eq 4 by multiplying for the f 2 factor were compared to data from the literature frank and klöpffer 1988 in the cited paper frank and klöpffer reported average radiation intensity referred to the time interval of solar noon 4 h to obtain the measured cumulated incident radiation these values were multiplied by δt 28 800 s i e the time interval from 8 00 to 16 00 h f 2 took a value of 0 58 latitude 52 longitude 5 similar values 57 have been experimentally found at a latitude of 40 3 n at madrid spain garcía gil et al 2019 fig 6 shows a good agreement between the predicted and literature data when using the estimated value of f 2 based on historical weather data which reduces the nrmse from 121 for f2 1 to 25 5 for f2 0 58 therefore an approach based on historical data of the weather considerably improves the prediction with respect to the assumption of fair weather conditions 3 3 implications for the modeling of direct virus photoinactivation upon introduction of the new parameter f 2 eq 6 allows for the calculation of the kinetic constant for the direct photoinactivation of the virus phix174 moreover considering that g d a y max λ e q f 1 p s n o λ e q τ d l eq 4 a more compact form for the same equation becomes the following 7 k dire ct 10 d f 2 g day max λ eq η app ε λ eq a 1 λ eq doc 1 10 100 a 1 λ eq d doc where λeq 307 5 nm η app 0 203 nm mol einstein 1 ε 307 5 nm 3 45 105 m 1 cm 1 and a 1 307 5 nm 0 00447 l mgc 1 cm 1 the values of f 2 can be obtained from the latitude and longitude geocoordinates using fig 5 or the f2 xlsx file provided as sm the calculated values for g d a y max 307 5 nm are reported in table 1 for latitudes between 60 s and 60 n with a step of 5 and for the 15th day of each month eq 7 with these data allows for the calculation of k direct for phix174 at different latitudes and seasons for different values of doc and d if additional data of g d a y max 307 5 nm are needed for other latitudes between 60 s and 60 n or days they can be calculated with eq 4 by considering that the values of photon flux density at solar noon p s n o 307 5 nm were obtained with eq s6 as a function of month and latitude while the values of τ dl were obtained with eq s7 eq 7 takes into account all the main parameters that have been shown to affect the photoinactivation of viruses irradiance doc and water depth moreover this equation also accounts for the effect of latitude and season on the first order kinetic constant through the irradiance g d a y max according to eqs s1 s7 for latitudes close to the equator g d a y max remains almost constant whereas for higher latitudes τ dl and p s n o increase in summer and decrease in winter fig 4 the same trend applies to the first order kinetic constant which is directly proportional to g d a y max however the value of f2 cannot be predictively calculated based exclusively on the latitude and the day of the year because it depends on the weather conditions for example for the republic of congo a high value of the kinetic constant would be expected according to its location at the equator however the high probability of cloud cover based on historical weather data leads to a significantly lower expected kinetic constant in this region fig 5 the ultimate goal of the present study is to use the model thus obtained to predict virus inactivation in the field to test the feasibility of this approach predictions by eq 7 were compared with field data of photoinduced virus inactivation the field results of boehm et al 2009 were taken into account that refer to the presumably mostly direct according to the authors photoinactivation of somatic phages with an overall behavior that has reasonable analogies with the direct photoinactivation of the somatic phage phix174 the cited authors found a maximal photoinactivation rate of somatic phages of 28 day 1 iuvb 1 in avalon bay california late august 33 n latitude 0 15 m water depth 7 mgc l 1 doc in order to compare this measurement with our model prediction it was necessary to assess the value of iuvb that was obtained by using smarts the same procedure used by the authors giving an average value of 0 41 w m 2 that agrees with the published data see fig 2 of boehm et al 2009 by so doing the field kinetic constant was calculated as 11 54 day 1 f 2 took a value of 0 82 latitude 33 longitude 118 our model prediction with eq 7 for phix174 is k direct 9 8 day 1 the error value of 15 looks more than reasonable if considering that the phages in the paper by bohem et al 2009 were not identical to those considered in our model and that indirect photoinactivation by most notably 1o2 could not be totally excluded bohem et al 2009 other differences between the model prediction and the field system include the high ionic strength and the presence of halide species in the marine environment these factors have previously been found to enhance the photoinactivation of viruses sinton et al 2002 another possibility is the occurrence of consistent sunny weather during the field study which took place during summer for very bright and sunny regions the value of f 2 is around 90 moreno sansegundo et al 2021 and if eq 7 is recalculated with f 2 0 9 instead of f 2 0 82 k direct 10 8 day 1 is obtained that is not far from the field datum note that a deactivation constant k direct 11 day 1 translates into a virus half life time t 1 2 1 5 h as an average value from 8 00 h to 16 00 h in the same 8 h time period sunlight would thus be able to inactivate 97 5 of the viruses that were initially present although this does not make complete disinfection it would certainly help reduce the viral load in water 4 conclusions here we propose a relatively simple procedure to estimate the kinetic constant for the direct photoinactivation of the somatic phage phix174 which is a typical model organism for the viruses that mainly undergo inactivation by the direct action of sunlight the procedure is based on an approximated equation for monochromatic light absorption which relies on the identification of the equivalent monochromatic wavelength that best simulates the behavior of the polychromatic system the main advantage of this approach is to obtain a simple and manageable equation eq 7 to easily predict inactivation kinetics with no need to use external and complex software predictions were quite good in the case of somatic phages undergoing direct photoinactivation in the field to extend the model to other types of viruses the corresponding values of φ and ε λ are required the simplicity of the procedure leads to a few limitations that do not really compromise its usefulness for example for latitudes in which there is no sunrise or sunset in some seasons this procedure is not applicable because τ d l cannot be calculated with eq s7 however in these latitudes below 60 s and above 60 n the incident radiation received is not enough to take advantage of a sunlight mediated process the most significant limitation is probably the fact that considering average weather with the f 2 parameter would not fit well periods with consistently fine or bad weather however this is a handicap that more complex software based polychromatic approaches would not solve either declaration of competing interest the authors

16463,the conventional reclaimed water technologies could not effectively remove the micropollutants although the health risks of these residual micropollutants have been evaluated by model calculation few animal based studies have been performed which is essential for risk verification here we used transcriptomic metabolomic and other biochemical techniques to reveal the toxicity variations of effluents from oxidation ditch od coagulation tank ct biological aerated filter baf and ultraviolet disinfection pool uv in a reclaimed water plant located in nanjing china no evident toxicity reduction trend was observed along the treatment units compared with control and other three treatment unit effluents long term exposure to reclaimed water uv effluent aggravated oxidative stress in mice and induced abnormal lipid metabolism and immune response moreover striking correlations were identified between multi omic biomarkers 4 differentially expressed genes and 8 significant changes metabolites and residual micropollutants 40 semi volatile organic compounds and 6n nitrosamines our results strongly highlight that the health risks of reclaimed water are mainly induced by the residual micropollutants and more advanced treatments and stringent discharge standards are needed to ensure the safety of reclaimed water keywords reclaimed water multi omic residual micropollutants toxicity variations oxidative stress 1 introduction as rivers lakes and other freshwater resources are increasingly polluted and overexploited we face the dilemma of a shortage of conventional freshwater resources particularly in originally water insufficient areas ma et al 2020 schwarzenbach et al 2010 increasing freshwater resources and making full use of the existing limited freshwater resources has become a significant challenge that cannot be avoided in the course of human development tortajada and van rensburg 2020 water reclamation seawater desalination and inter basin water transfer are three mainstream strategies to alleviate the water supply pressure cosgrove and loucks 2015 compared with the high cost of the other two paths water reclamation is generally considered more economical and environmentally friendly voulvoulis 2018 reclaimed water has been widely used in many developed countries such as australia israel japan singapore and united states where its utilization rate is over 70 cherchi et al 2019 li et al 2020 china is the biggest developing country with the most severe shortage of water resources globally lyu et al 2016 where the utilization rate of reclaimed water has reached 80 69 9 75 1010 m3 in 2019 mohurd 2020 however the safety of reclaimed water is still the focus of controversy which restricts the further promotion of reclaimed water christou et al 2017 deng et al 2019 dickin et al 2016 the health risks of reclaimed water may be attributed to the residual micropollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs phthalate esters paes and pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps these micropollutants have been frequently detected in reclaimed water and are difficult to remove due to their trace concentrations and complex structures deng et al 2018 gassie and englehardt 2017 moreover some organic micropollutants are precursors of disinfection by products which may bring new health risks in the disinfection process of reclaimed water du et al 2017 gilca et al 2020 therefore it is critical to evaluate the potential health risks of the micropollutants remaining in reclaimed water our recent study demonstrated that conventional treatment processes of reclaimed water plants could not effectively remove the micropollutants and the trace pollutants still have carcinogenic risks deng et al 2018 however traditional health risk assessments cannot accurately reflect the real health risks of reclaimed water animal based toxicological experiments are urgent to verify these potential risks moreover traditional toxicity evaluation based on a few target genes proteins and metabolites cannot reveal the comprehensive toxic effects of reclaimed water with complex pollutant composition multi omics technologies are powerful for high throughput screening of critical toxic effects from different bio molecular levels such as transcriptomics and metabolomics thus multi omics can be used to evaluate the systematic responses of organisms exposed to reclaimed water containing complex micropollutants and provide rich multiple molecular profiling information which was also an indispensable and critical step for a comprehensive and systematic assessment of the potential health risks of reclaimed water additionally an accurate understanding of the toxicity of effluents from different treatment units could guide future reclaimed water production and related toxicity reduction in this study the toxicity variations of effluents from different units of a conventional reclaimed water plant from nanjing china was evaluated using male mice after exposure of 90 days multi omics methods including transcriptomics and metabolomics were conducted and a set of biochemical indicators were determined finally the correlation between omics alterations and micropollutants in the final effluent was also investigated 2 materials and method 2 1 water sampling water samples

disinfection pool uv water samples from different units were filtered by 0 45 μm membrane filters whatman maidstone kent uk and stored at 4 c before exposure to mice all glass bottles for sampling were pre cleaned with chromosulfuric acid and deionized water the concentrations of micropollutants including 40 svocs and 6 nas in the same water samples have been detected in our recent study deng

animal breeding center nanjing china the mice were housed in stainless steel cages and acclimated for two weeks at 25 4 c 50 5 relative humidity and a 12 12 h light dark cycle food and water were provided ad libitum a total of 25 healthy male mice were randomly assigned to five groups n 5 for each group after 7 days of acclimation four groups were fed with the effluents from od ct baf and uv

the tissue injure score was calculated using imagej https imagej nih gov ij according to the method described in a recent study li et al 2019 2 4 biochemical analysis the activity of glutathione peroxidase gsh px and the level of malonaldehyde mda in the livers were determined to evaluate the oxidative stress induced by reclaimed water moreover the 8 hydroxy 2 deoxyguanosine 8 ohdg level was selected as the biomarker for hepatic oxidative dna damage these biochemical indicators were measured using commercial kits nanjing jiancheng bioeng inst china all assays were conducted according to the manufacture s protocols 2 5 transcriptomic analysis microarray analysis was conducted to explore the transcriptomic alterations induced by reclaimed water at the end of the exposure the mice livers of each treatment were pooled homogenized in trizol life technologies carlsbad ca and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen samples were stored at 80 c until rna isolation was performed the rna isolation and cdna synthesis were according to our previous report deng et al 2020 affymetrix genechip mouse genome 430 2 0 system affymetrix santa clara ca was performed according to the standard affymetrix protocol in shanghai biotechnology corporation raw data were normalized by the mas 5 0 algorithm in genespring software version 12 6 1 agilent technologies usa differentially expressed

xanthine dehydrogenase xdh and 1 reference gene actin beta β actin details of the rt qpcr experiment are described in si and the primers are listed in table s2 2 6 metabolomic analysis a total of 320

the variable influence on projection vip score 1 to visualize the variations of metabolites between different groups heat maps were generated based on z scores in r v 3 3 with the pheatmap package v 1

each group unless otherwise noted one way anova followed by bonferroni post hoc test spss 22 spss inc chicago il usa was used to evaluate the statistical differences of biological parameters between two groups p value 0 05 was accepted as significance the results were expressed as mean standard deviation sd 3 results 3 1 water consumption and physiological changes no mortality was observed during the exposure period the water consumption in 2 days was 40 07 4 82 42 56 5 64 39 17 4 53 41 18 5 73 and 40 93 6 12 g for control od ct baf and uv groups table 1 indicating that the exposure of different effluents did not affect the water consumption of mice however the final body weight significantly decreased p 0 05 in the od and uv groups table 1 simultaneously the relative weight of the liver remarkably decreased p 0 05 in the uv group whereas the relative weight of the kidney significantly decreased p 0 05 in the od and ct groups table 1 these results suggested that long term exposure to different effluents caused adverse effects in mice and the in depth toxic effects deserve further study 3 2 histopathological changes and oxidative stress no obvious histopathological damage was found in the liver and kidney of the control group however cellular necrosis or inflammatory infiltration was observed in both liver and kidney from all effluent groups fig 1 a further quantitative analysis showed that these tissue damages were not significantly mitigated with the treatment process fig 1b these tissue injuries may be attributed to oxidative stress triggered by the residual micropollutants in the effluents therefore three typical biomarkers of oxidative stress gsh px 8 ohdg and mda were determined fig 2 compared with control od baf and uv effluents significantly increased p 0 05 gsh px and 8 ohdg fig 2a and b mda was significantly increased p 0 05 by the od and baf effluents fig 2c compared with the effluents from the upstream units od ct and baf the effluent from uv did not significantly changed the levels of these oxidative stress biomarkers p 0 05 these results suggested that different effluents induced hepatic oxidative stress and more importantly these oxidative effects were not reduced along the treatment process 3 3 transcriptomic alterations to further reveal the toxic effects of different effluents transcriptomic profiling was conducted by using microarray which can detect 34 000 genes simultaneously a total of 643 degs were identified including 176 181 193 and 238 degs in the od ct baf and uv groups receptively fig 3 a only 4 out of 643 degs were identified in all effluent groups fig 3b and the four common degs were selected for rt qpcr verification the results of rt qpcr were well paralleled with the microarray data and no significant changes were observed in the expression of these common degs among different effluent groups p 0 05 fig 3c cluster analysis of transcriptomic profiles showed that the transcriptomic alterations of od and ct groups were similar while those of baf and uv groups were similar fig 3d indicating the nonmonotonic changes of the transcriptome of different effluent groups go enrichment was also conducted for the degs as a result 76 98 72 and 198 go terms were identified in od ct baf and uv groups respectively fig 4 a among these go terms 5 6 22 and 9 go terms were shared by od ct ct baf baf uv and od uv respectively different units shared a certain number of go terms and baf and uv shared the greatest number of go terms these common go terms are mainly related to lipid metabolism and oxidative stress fig 4b these results indicated that the variations of degs related functions in different groups had a certain continuity in the fluctuation 3 4 metabolomic alterations based on the above results of histopathological physiological and transcriptomic analyses no significant toxicity reduction was observed in different treatment groups therefore metabolomic alterations in serum were only determined in the control and uv groups the result of pls da analysis shows that the metabolomic profiles of the uv group can be successfully separated from the control group fig 5 a indicating significant alterations in metabolome caused by uv effluent in addition a total of 8 scms were identified in the uv group among these scms o acetyl glycoproteins 0 70 0 07 fold change glutamine 0 74 0 06 fold change methionine 0 66 0 10 fold change and ethanol 0 75 0 09 fold change were significantly decreased whereas glycerol 1 30 0 12 fold change glycine 1 50 0 37 fold change taurine 1 24 0 17 fold change and tyrosine 1 84 0 42 fold change were significantly increased fig 5b 3 5 correlation between multi omic biomarkers and micropollutants to explore whether the toxicity variations in different effluents were related to the residual micropollutants the correlation between multi omic biomarkers degs and scms and micropollutants was calculated fig 6 notably omic biomarkers were positively or negatively correlated with 22 out of 46 micropollutants for instance rag2 was significant anti correlated with 1 4 dichlorobenzene pdcb bis 2 chloroethyl ether bcee bis 2 chloroethoxy methane cem isophorone ip and n nitrosodiethylamine ndea p 0 05 methionine was significant positive correlated with naphthalene nap and pyrene pyr p 0 05 these data indicated that the toxic effects in different effluents were closely related to the concentrations of residual micropollutants 4 discussion in this study multiple omics techniques and biochemical analysis were used to explore the in vivo toxicity variations in the effluents from different treatment units of a conventional reclaimed water plant no apparent toxicity reduction was observed along the treatment process the final effluent from the uv unit still induced various toxic effects including alterations in the transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles and oxidative stress caused in tissues furthermore a striking relationship between multi omics biomarkers degs and scms and residual micropollutants svocs and nas was also identified with the increasing utilization rate of reclaimed water the potential health risks in the process of reuse have attracted worldwide attention deng et al 2019 who 2017 although many policies and standards have been implemented in different countries to ensure the safety of reclaimed water campbell and scott 2011 lee and tan 2016 lyu et al 2016 usepa 2012 the health risks caused by reclaimed water are still frequently reported and they are mainly attributed to the residual micropollutants such as persistent organic pollutants endocrine disrupting compounds and pharmaceutical and personal care products deng et al 2019 here various toxic effects on mice after long term exposure to different treatment unit effluents were observed oxidative stress may be the primary toxicity mechanism induced by these effluents xdh was overexpressed in all effluent groups indicating that more xanthine dehydrogenase was converted to xanthine oxidase by sulfhydryl residues oxidation or proteolysis lee et al 2014 this conversion process has been assumed to be required for radical generation and tissue injures correspondingly remarkable histopathological changes have been observed in the liver and kidney of mice meanwhile gsh px 8 ohdg and mda were increased in the liver of all effluent groups which further demonstrated that different effluents induced hepatic oxidative stress on the other hand oxidative stress would further disrupt the normal metabolism especially amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism deng et al 2014 schieber and chandel 2014 consequently 8 serum scms related to amino acid glutamine methionine glycine and tyrosine metabolism and lipid taurine ethanol and glycerol metabolism were identified after exposure to reclaimed water notably the abnormal lipid metabolism was also demonstrated by the enriched go terms such as cellular response to lipopolysaccharide and cholesterol metabolic process in addition immune responses were observed at both transcriptomic and histopathological levels which may be related to oxidative stress and abnormal lipid metabolism im et al 2011 schieber and chandel 2014 it is worth noting that no obvious toxicity mitigation trend was observed along the treatment process for example at the transcription level the number of degs caused by the effluent of downstream unit was not significantly less than that caused by the effluent of upstream unit there was no significant difference in the expression level of common degs among the four treatment groups p 0 05 a similar trend was confirmed by biochemical and histopathological analysis the alterations of biochemical indicators and tissue injure scores were not mitigated along the treatment units p 0 05 unfortunately the toxicity of the final effluent was not significantly reduced based on the significantly changed metabolic profiles in the mice serum these results were consistent with our recent calculation results based on the risk assessment model deng et al 2018 these results indicate that the conventional process of the reclaimed water plant is difficult to effectively remove trace toxic pollutants furthermore the unique relationship between multi omic biomarkers and micropollutants was identified highlighting that the residual micropollutants played a vital role in the health risks of reclaimed water many organic contaminants can cause toxicities even at trace concentrations ng l for example environmental concentrations of benz a anthracene baa and phenanthrene phe can induce developmental defects and dna damage in fishes le bihanic et al 2015 peng et al 2019 baa and phe were detected in the reclaimed water used here and significantly correlated with serum ethanol and taurine respectively similarly previous studies have demonstrated that the effluents from traditional sewage plants still have potential health risks due to their low removal efficiency of organic pollutants zhang et al 2013 many micropollutants are hydrophobic and difficult to settle in the sludge which is not conducive to microbial degradation deng et al 2019 moreover the removal efficiency of these pollutants is also related to the specific influent concentration treatment process and operating conditions deng et al 2019 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2009 although uv disinfection is used as an advanced treatment in this reclaimed water plant the final effluent still presents health risks the potential reason may be that uv disinfection could not effectively remove the micropollutants and even produced some toxic disinfection by products such as nas du et al 2017 which have been detected in the effluents used here therefore some other advanced treatment technologies such as membrane filtration based technologies are recommended for future reclaimed water production the removal efficiency of micropollutants could be generally improved by 20 50 by membrane filtration technologies grandclément et al 2017 warsinger et al 2018 besides new guidelines associated with toxic micropollutants also should be issued by the government agencies as soon as possible 5 conclusions in conclusion this work evaluated the toxicity variations in different effluents from different treatment units of a conventional reclaimed water plant multi omic biomarkers screened by transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling were significantly correlated with the residual micropollutants in the reclaimed water highlighting that conventional reclaimed water plants and conventional treatment processes could not effectively remove the micropollutants also could not reduce the corresponding health risks of the final reclaimed

selected as the biomarker for hepatic oxidative dna damage these biochemical indicators were measured using commercial kits nanjing jiancheng bioeng inst china all assays were conducted according to the manufacture s protocols 2 5 transcriptomic analysis microarray analysis was conducted to explore the transcriptomic alterations induced by reclaimed water at the end of the exposure the mice

isolation and cdna synthesis were according to our previous report deng et al 2020 affymetrix genechip mouse genome 430 2 0 system affymetrix santa clara ca was performed according to the standard affymetrix protocol in shanghai biotechnology corporation raw data were normalized by the mas 5 0 algorithm in genespring software version 12 6 1 agilent technologies usa differentially expressed genes degs between treatment and control groups were identified as those with a fold change of more than 1 5 and a p value 0 05 the gene oncology go enrichment was analyzed using r v 3 3 with the clusterprofiler package v 3 14 yu et al 2012 the enriched pathways were identified based on the criteria that p value 0 05 and deg number 3 to validate the transcriptomic results real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr analyses were conducted for 4 target genes atpase na k transporting alpha 3 polypeptide atp1a3 recombination activating gene 2 rag2 trefoil factor 3 tff3 xanthine dehydrogenase xdh and 1 reference gene actin beta β actin details of the rt qpcr experiment are described in si and the primers are listed in table s2 2 6 metabolomic analysis a total of 320 μl phosphate sodium buffer 70 mm na2hpo4 0 025 w v nan3 20 v v d2o 3 mm sodium trimethylsily 2 2 3 3 2h4 proionate tsp ph 7 4 was added to 250 μl of each serum sample from control and uv exposure groups the mixture was homogenized and centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 min and then 520 μl of the supernatants were transferred into 5 mm nmr tubes for analysis the detailed detection methods and spectral processing were described in our previous study deng et al 2017 2014 the metabolite resonances were identified according to our previous studies deng et al 2014 and the human metabolome database hmdb http www hmdb ca partial least squares discrimination analysis pls da was used to explore the main effects in the nmr data sets and calculated by using r v 3 3 with the mixomics package v 6 10 1 the significantly changed metabolites scms between the control and effluent groups were identified by significance analysis of microarrays sam software with false discovery rate fdr 0 01 and the variable influence on projection vip score 1 to visualize the variations of metabolites between different groups heat maps were generated based on z scores in r v 3 3 with the pheatmap package v 1 0 12 finally pearson correlation analysis between micropollutants and multi omic biomarkers degs and scms was conducted in r v 3 3 2 7 statistical analysis more than three replicates were performed in each group unless otherwise noted one way anova followed by bonferroni post hoc test spss 22 spss inc chicago il usa was used to evaluate the statistical differences of biological parameters between two groups p value 0 05 was accepted as significance the results were expressed as mean standard deviation sd 3 results 3 1 water consumption and physiological changes no mortality was observed during the exposure period the water consumption in 2 days was 40 07 4 82 42 56 5 64 39 17 4 53 41 18 5 73 and 40 93 6 12 g for control od ct baf and uv groups table 1 indicating that the exposure of different effluents did not affect the water consumption of mice however the final body weight significantly decreased p 0 05 in the od and uv groups table 1 simultaneously the relative weight of the liver remarkably decreased p 0 05 in the uv group whereas the relative weight of the kidney significantly decreased p 0 05 in the od and ct groups table 1 these results suggested that long term exposure to different effluents caused adverse effects in mice and the in depth toxic effects deserve further study 3 2 histopathological changes and oxidative stress no obvious histopathological damage was found in the liver and kidney of the control group however cellular necrosis or inflammatory infiltration was observed in both liver and kidney from all effluent groups fig 1 a further quantitative analysis showed that these tissue damages were not significantly mitigated with the treatment process fig 1b these tissue injuries may be attributed to oxidative stress triggered by the residual micropollutants in the effluents therefore three typical biomarkers of oxidative stress gsh px 8 ohdg and mda were determined fig 2 compared with control od baf and uv effluents significantly increased p 0 05 gsh px and 8 ohdg fig 2a and b mda was significantly increased p 0 05 by the od and baf effluents fig 2c compared with the effluents from the upstream units od ct and baf the effluent from uv did not significantly changed the levels of these oxidative stress biomarkers p 0 05 these results suggested that different effluents induced hepatic oxidative stress and more importantly these oxidative effects were not reduced along the treatment process 3 3 transcriptomic alterations to further reveal the toxic effects of different effluents transcriptomic profiling was conducted by using microarray which can detect 34 000 genes simultaneously a total of 643 degs were identified including 176 181 193 and 238 degs in the od ct baf and uv groups receptively fig 3 a only 4 out of 643 degs were identified in all effluent groups fig 3b and the four common degs were selected for rt qpcr verification the results of rt qpcr were well paralleled with the microarray data and no significant changes were observed in the expression of these common degs among different effluent groups p 0 05 fig 3c cluster analysis of transcriptomic profiles showed that the transcriptomic alterations of od and ct groups were similar while those of baf and uv groups were similar fig 3d indicating the nonmonotonic changes of the transcriptome of different effluent groups go enrichment was also conducted for the degs as a result 76 98 72 and 198 go terms were identified in od ct baf and uv groups respectively fig 4 a among these go terms 5 6 22 and 9 go terms were shared by od ct ct baf baf uv and od uv respectively different units shared a certain number of go terms and baf and uv shared the greatest number of go terms these common go terms are mainly related to lipid metabolism and oxidative stress fig 4b these results indicated that the variations of degs related functions in different groups had a certain continuity in the fluctuation 3 4 metabolomic alterations based on the above results of histopathological physiological and transcriptomic analyses no significant toxicity reduction was observed in different treatment groups therefore metabolomic alterations in serum were only determined in the control and uv groups the result of pls da analysis shows that the metabolomic profiles of the uv group can be successfully separated from the control group fig 5 a indicating significant alterations in metabolome caused by uv effluent in addition a total of 8 scms were identified in the uv group among these scms o acetyl glycoproteins 0 70 0 07 fold change glutamine 0 74 0 06 fold change methionine 0 66 0 10 fold change and ethanol 0 75 0 09 fold change were significantly decreased whereas glycerol 1 30 0 12 fold change glycine 1 50 0 37 fold change taurine 1 24 0 17 fold change and tyrosine 1 84 0 42 fold change were significantly increased fig 5b 3 5 correlation between multi omic biomarkers and micropollutants to explore whether the toxicity variations in different effluents were related to the residual micropollutants the correlation between multi omic biomarkers degs and scms and micropollutants was calculated fig 6 notably omic biomarkers were positively or negatively correlated with 22 out of 46 micropollutants for instance rag2 was significant anti correlated with 1 4 dichlorobenzene pdcb bis 2 chloroethyl ether bcee bis 2 chloroethoxy methane cem isophorone ip and n nitrosodiethylamine ndea p 0 05 methionine was significant positive correlated with naphthalene nap and pyrene pyr p 0 05 these data indicated that the toxic effects in different effluents were closely related to the concentrations of residual micropollutants 4 discussion in this study multiple omics techniques and biochemical analysis were used to explore the in vivo toxicity variations in the effluents from different treatment units of a conventional reclaimed water plant no apparent toxicity reduction was observed along the treatment process the final effluent from the uv unit still induced various toxic effects including alterations in the transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles and oxidative stress caused in tissues furthermore a striking relationship between multi omics biomarkers degs and scms and residual micropollutants svocs and nas was also identified with the increasing utilization rate of reclaimed water the potential health risks in the process of reuse have attracted worldwide attention deng et al 2019 who 2017 although many policies and standards have been implemented in different countries to ensure the safety of reclaimed water campbell and scott 2011 lee and tan 2016 lyu et al 2016 usepa 2012 the health risks caused by reclaimed water are still frequently reported and they are mainly attributed to the residual micropollutants such as persistent organic pollutants endocrine disrupting compounds and pharmaceutical and personal care products deng et al 2019 here various toxic effects on mice after long term exposure to different treatment unit effluents were observed oxidative stress may be the primary toxicity mechanism induced by these effluents xdh was overexpressed in all effluent groups indicating that more xanthine dehydrogenase was converted to xanthine oxidase by sulfhydryl residues oxidation or proteolysis lee et al 2014 this conversion process has been assumed to be required for radical generation and tissue injures correspondingly remarkable histopathological changes have been observed in the liver and kidney of mice meanwhile gsh px 8 ohdg and mda were increased in the liver of all effluent groups which further demonstrated that different effluents induced hepatic oxidative stress on the other hand oxidative stress would further disrupt the normal metabolism especially amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism deng et al 2014 schieber and chandel 2014 consequently 8 serum scms related to amino acid glutamine methionine glycine and tyrosine metabolism and lipid taurine ethanol and glycerol metabolism were identified after exposure to reclaimed water notably the abnormal lipid metabolism was also demonstrated by the enriched go terms such as cellular response to lipopolysaccharide and cholesterol metabolic process in addition immune responses were observed at both transcriptomic and histopathological levels which may be related to oxidative stress and abnormal lipid metabolism im et al 2011 schieber and chandel 2014 it is worth noting that no obvious toxicity mitigation trend was observed along the treatment process for example at the transcription level the number of degs caused by the effluent of downstream unit was not significantly less than that caused by the effluent of upstream unit there was no significant difference in the expression level of common degs among the four treatment groups p 0 05 a similar trend was confirmed by biochemical and histopathological analysis the alterations of biochemical indicators and tissue injure scores were not mitigated along the treatment units p 0 05 unfortunately the toxicity of the final effluent was not significantly reduced based on the significantly changed metabolic profiles in the mice serum these results were consistent with our recent calculation results based on the risk assessment model deng et al 2018 these results indicate that the conventional process of the reclaimed water plant is difficult to effectively remove trace toxic pollutants furthermore the unique relationship between multi omic biomarkers and micropollutants was identified highlighting that the residual micropollutants played a vital role in the health risks of reclaimed water many organic contaminants can cause toxicities even at trace concentrations ng l for example environmental concentrations of benz a anthracene baa and phenanthrene phe can induce developmental defects and dna damage in fishes le bihanic et al 2015 peng et al 2019 baa and phe were detected in the reclaimed water used here and significantly correlated with serum ethanol and taurine respectively similarly previous studies have demonstrated that the effluents from traditional sewage plants still have potential health risks due to their low removal efficiency of organic pollutants zhang et al 2013 many micropollutants are hydrophobic and difficult to settle in the sludge which is not conducive to microbial degradation deng et al 2019 moreover the removal efficiency of these pollutants is also related to the specific influent concentration treatment process and operating conditions deng et al 2019 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2009 although uv disinfection is used as an advanced treatment in this reclaimed water plant the final effluent still presents health risks the potential reason may be that uv disinfection could not effectively remove the micropollutants and even produced some toxic disinfection by products such as nas du et al 2017 which have been detected in the effluents used here therefore some other advanced treatment technologies such as membrane filtration based technologies are recommended for future reclaimed water production the removal efficiency of micropollutants could be generally improved by 20 50 by membrane filtration technologies grandclément et al 2017 warsinger et al 2018 besides new guidelines associated with toxic micropollutants also should be issued by the government agencies as soon as possible 5 conclusions in conclusion this work evaluated the toxicity variations in different effluents from different treatment units of a conventional reclaimed water plant multi omic biomarkers screened by transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling were significantly correlated with the residual micropollutants in the reclaimed water highlighting that conventional reclaimed water plants and conventional treatment processes could not effectively remove the micropollutants also could not reduce the corresponding health risks of the final reclaimed

16464,biological nitrogen removal from pharmaceutical wastewater has drawn increasing attention due to biotoxicity and inhibition in this study for the first time a novel approach integrating partial denitrification with anaerobic ammonia oxidation pd a in a sequencing biofilm batch reactor sbbr was proposed and demonstrated to be efficient to treat the bismuth nitrate and bismuth potassium citrate manufacturing wastewater containing ammonia nh4 n and nitrate no3 n of 6300 50 mg l 1 and 15 300 50 mg l 1 the maximum anammox activity was found at the shock effect of influent total nitrogen tn of 100 mg l 1 with no3 n nh4 n of 1 0 long term operation demonstrated that the pd a biofilm was developed rapidly after 30 days using synthetic influent with tn removal efficiency increasing from 40 9 to 80 8 significantly the key bacteria for pd a had high tolerance and adapted rapidly to pharmaceutical wastewater achieving a relatively stable tn removal efficiency of 81 2 with influent nh4 n and no3 n was 77 9 2 6 and 104 1 4 4 mg l 1 at a relatively low cod no3 n of 2 6 anammox pathway contributed to tn removal reached 83 6 significant increase of loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances was obtained with increasing protein of 3 turn helices structure as response to the inhibitory condition high throughput sequencing analysis revealed that the functional genus thauera was highly enriched in both biofilms 9 5 43 6 and suspended biomass 15 5 57 5 which played a key role in high no2 n accumulation while the anammox bacteria decreasing from 7 8 to 1 6 in biofilm and from 1 8 decreased to 0 1 in the suspended sludge overall this study provides a new method of high strength pharmaceutical wastewater treatment with low energy consumption and operation cost as well as a satisfactory efficiency graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pharmaceutical wastewater partial denitrification anammox biofilm functional bacteria enrichment extracellular polymeric substances eps 1 introduction with the rapid development of health medication in recent decades increasing requirement of pharmaceuticals production has attracted the concerns of the public pharmaceutical wastewater has become the serious environment problem due to the potential impacts of high concentrations of refractory organic pollutants inorganic nitrogen compounds and salts on water quality gadipelly et al 2014 wang et al 2020a zhao et al 2019 among these pollutants inorganic nitrogen is of increasing concern because it would cause serious eutrophication and pathogenicity especially the high concentrations of no3 n physical chemical methods have been used to remove different types of pollutants such as the use of ionizing radiation coupled techniques to remove antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance genes args in wastewater chu et al 2021 besides coagulation adsorption air flotation ion exchange and membrane separation methods are also commonly used for organic compounds and heavy metals in pharmaceutical wastewater chen et al 2020a rasouli et al 2017 rathi and kumar 2021 as for nitrogen removal biological treatment methods are undoubtedly the most economical and efficient way to remove nitrogen in wastewater due to its cost saving operation highly efficient and less by products chen et al 2020b qiu et al 2021 however a variety of inhibitory factors have negative effect on microbial activities and limits the efficiency of biological treatment novel technology is strongly needed for different type of pharmaceutical wastewater chelliapan et al 2011 compared to conventional processes for nitrogen removal the anammox process has been regarded as the most cost effective and ecologically acceptable method for biological nitrogen removal from wastewater cao et al 2019c lin and wang 2017 it directly converts nh4 n and no2 n into nitrogen gas n2 with 11 production of no3 n under anoxic conditions it has been successfully used in treatment of ammonium rich wastewaters such as digestion poultry potato processing effluent lackner et al 2014 shi et al 2016 van der star et al 2007 however the anammox bacteria grow slowly doubling time of 10 x223c 30 days and is extremely sensitive to environmental stress e g ph temperature organic matter degraaf et al 1996 fux et al 2004 van der star et al 2008 this usually results in the serious deterioration of nitrogen removal performance weralupitiya et al 2021 more importantly the anammox process not only cannot remove no3 n in the wastewater there is nitrogen residue due to the 11 production of no3 n in this reaction du et al 2019b this limits the application on its own and further combined processes are necessary especially for the industrial wastewater containing high concentration no3 n the partial denitrification pd no3 n no2 n provides promising biological processes for nitrogen removal via anammox technology cao et al 2017 by combining pd and anammox simultaneous removal of high concentration nh4 n and no3 n in synthetic wastewater has been achieved du et al 2019a 2019b compared with the traditional nitrification denitrification process the pd a process requires no aeration energy saves the organic carbon source demand and reduces the sludge output and the greenhouse gas thus has great potential for treating industrial wastewater due to its high removal efficiency for no3 n and nh4 n proved in many reports cao et al 2019a du et al 2016 han et al 2021 to date only few studies have been reported on nitrogen removal from industrial and pharmaceutical wastewater using the anammox which mainly focused on the two stage partial nitrification combining with anammox processes in granular sludge systems daverey et al 2013 shen et al 2012 tang et al 2011 to the best of our knowledge the feasibility and performance of the novel pd a process in single stage biofilm treating the pharmaceutical wastewater contained no3 n and nh4 n has rarely been explored on the other hand the anammox microorganisms might be over competed by denitrifying bacteria and washed out from the system under the inhibitory stress due to its much lower growth rate this would seriously destroy the nitrogen removal performance and even hardly retrieve efficient retention of slow growth bacteria should be considered especially for real industrial wastewater for this reason the formation of biofilms offers an effective alternative for the integrated pd a process which was regarded to retain and reduce the wash out of anammox bacteria fernández et al 2008 gilbert et al 2015 moreover the attached biomass had higher tolerance against toxic compounds compared to the suspended sludge phanwilai et al 2020 therefore a new concept of pd a biofilm was proposed to treat the pharmaceutical wastewater containing high strength no3 n and nh4 n the aim of this work is to develop and explore the integrated pd a process treating actual pharmaceutical wastewater contained no3 n and nh4 n with low ph and high salinity a lab scale pd a sbbr was established for evaluating the long term nitrogen removal performance from real wastewater the variation of biomass properties and microbial community structure as well as the enrichment of key bacteria during biofilm formation period were comprehensively investigated the microbial response of eps to the inhibition from set up to adaption stage feeding with real wastewater were also analyzed results in this work is expected to provide a promising method and in depth understanding of microbial mechanism for the biological treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation this study was conducted in an integrated anoxic fixed bed biofilm sbr made of methyl methacrylate with a working volume of 10 0 l a schematic diagram of the reactor is presented in fig s1 a total of 140 blank carriers were strung together by using stainless steel wire and then fixed into a plastic rack with a 12 6 of packing ratio the carriers were cylinders made of polyethylene with a specific surface area of 500 m2 m3 more characteristics of biofilm carriers were described in table s1 during the operation period the hydraulic retention time hrt of the system was controlled at 20 h each sbbr cycle consisted of 10 min of filling 600 min of mixing 30 min of biomass settling and 10 min of drawing out the liquid the ph value in the influent tank was maintained at 7 0 7 5 by the addition of 5 0 m naoh before being fed into the reactor the reactor operates at ambient temperature without any temperature controller the long term operation was divided into four phases as summarized in table 1 phases ⅰ ⅱ day 1 50 comprised the start up period and stable operation period while phases ⅲ ⅳ day 51 180 the actual pharmaceutical wastewater begins to be treated in the reactor 2 2 wastewater and seeding sludge the influent synthetic wastewater adopted in the startup period contained nh4cl and nano3 with the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n at 50 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 respectively at the same time trace elements and minerals were added to meet the nutritional needs of microbial growth and reproduction the composition of the mineral medium contained kh2po4 30 mg l 1 mgso4 7h2o 140 mg l 1 cacl2 2h2o 140 mg l 1 and 1 ml l 1 trace element solution

g nicl2 6h2o 0 014 g h3bo4 0 43 g znso4 7h2o 0 99 g mncl2 4h2o sodium acetate was added to provide sufficient electron donor which was regarded as the easily degradable and commonly used carbon source in wastewater treatment plants cao et al 2019b du et al 2017 the sodium acetate solution 75 g cod l 1 was prepared in a vessel and was fed into the reactor with a peristaltic pump at the beginning of each cycle pharmaceutical wastewater was used for batch tests and long term operation of the pd a reactor the wastewater was collected from a pharmaceutical manufacture plant in southern china which contained no3 n nh4 n and complex organic acid as main pollutants with high salinity since the wastewater from different production lines was mixed before going to be treated the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations were measured not only for each line but also for the mixture influent nh4 n and no3 n concentrations before dilution reached up to 6300 50 mg l 1 and 15 300 50 mg l 1 respectively while the biodegradable organic matter was at a low level table s2 the inoculated sludge used in this experiment was collected from a pd a sbr that had been operated stably for two years in our laboratory the parental reactor achieved a high tn removal efficiency of over 93 by feeding with synthetic wastewater containing nh4 n and no3 n and candidatus brocadia was the only identified anammox bacteria zhang et al 2019 the initial concentrations of the volatile suspended solids vss and total suspended solids tss after inoculation were 0 38 and 0 89 g l 1 respectively during the experiment the suspended sludge was attached to the blank carriers and the formation of biofilm was observed gradually 2 3 batch experiments five batch tests were implemented before the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater to verify the feasibility of the pd a sbbr to treat this type of wastewater the experimental conditions are summarized in table 2 the impact of pharmaceutical wastewater on ammonia oxidizing bacteria and denitrifying bacteria was investigated through batch tests the details of the batch tests are as follows the batch tests were each conducted in a serum bottle with a working volume of 500 ml during the batch test the magnetic stirrer rotation speed was controlled at 150 rpm min 1 to keep the sludge suspended the whole process was carried out in a constant temperature incubator at 28 c fig s2 wash the sludge at the end of the reaction from the reactor three times with distilled water to wash away the remaining substrate subsequently a specific volume of pharmaceutical wastewater was injected into the bottle to acquire initial no3 n concentrations in the range of 25 700 mg l 1 at the same time a certain volume of nh4 n 10 g l 1 was added to kept the ratio of no3 n nh4 n in the water at 1 0 the ratio of cod no3 n c n in bottle was maintained at 3 0 during the whole test sodium acetate is the same type of carbon source added in the reactor for a long time during the batch tests 2 ml of suspensions from the bottles were collected at appropriate time intervals from 5 to 60 min and filtered to measure the concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and no2 n 2 4 calculations 2 4 1 contributions of anammox and denitrification to total nitrogen removal the generally stoichiometric equations of anammox were used to calculate the contribution of different pathways according to the previous studies and the nitrogen loading in this study du et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the determination of anammox and denitrification contribution to nitrogen removal of pd a sbbr was performed according to the eqs 1 2 anammox percentage 1 inf nh 4 eff nh 4 1 32 inf nh 4 eff nh 4 100 inf tn eff tn the inf nh4 and eff nh4 were the nh4 n concentration in the influent and effluent during long term operation respectively the inf tn and eff tn were referred to tn concentration in the influent and effluent the tn included nh4 n no3 n and no2 n denitrification percentage 2 inf no 3 eff no 3 1 32 inf nh 4 eff nh 4 0 26 inf nh 4 eff nh 4 100 inf tn eff tn the inf no3 and eff no3 were the no3 n concentration influent and effluent during long term operation respectively it was assumed that the nitrogen assimilation due to heterotrophic growth was neglected in the calculations 2 4 2 ntr in partial denitrification process the conversion rate of no3 n to no2 n can be expressed as eq 3 ntr 3 c t no 2 c amx t no 2 c 0 no 2 100 c 0 no 3 c amx t no 3 c t no 3 where ct no2 represents the maximum no2 n production at time t c0 no2 was the initial no2 n concentration in a cycle and the camx t no2 was the consumed no2 n by anammox reaction in theory at time t c0 no3 was the initial no3 n concentration ct no3 was the concentration of no3 n at time t and camx t no3 was the produced no3 n in anammox reaction at time t in a cycle 2 4 3 kinetics in batch experiments during the experiment the partial denitrification activity was represented by specific no3 n reduction rates r no3 and no2 n accumulation rates r no2 the anammox activity was identified by specific nh4 n depletion rates r nh4 as shown in eqs 4 to 7 du et al 2020 4 r no 3 dn o 3 dt δ n o 3 mlvss δ t 1 5 r no 2 dn o 2 dt δ n o 2 mlvss δ t 1 6 r nh 4 dn h 4 dt δ n h 4 mlvss δ t 2 7 ntr r no 2 r no 3 100 where δno3 represents the decrease in no3 n concentration from the start of reaction to the point of maximum no2 n accumulation δt1 is the duration of no2 n accumulation period δno2 represents the increase in no2 n concentration from the start of reaction to the point of maximum no2 n accumulation and δnh4 is the increase in nh4 n concentration from the point of maximum no2 n accumulation to the depletion of no2 n or nh4 n δt2 is the duration of anammox period 2 5 analysis methods the samples collected were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane for the chemical analysis the parameters including nh4 n no2 n no3 n were analyzed according to standard methods using uv 12 spectrophotometer

spin kits for soil mp biomedicals usa according to a modified manufacturer s protocol the pcr reaction and high throughput sequencing were conducted using methods described in our previous work du et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 shocking effect of pharmaceutical wastewater on pd and anammox bacteria there were several studies that reported that the bacteria might be inhibited seriously when treating industrial wastewater due to the long term harmful effects of complex pollutants such as antibiotics metal ions and organic acid dehboudeh et al 2020 qi et al 2020 wang et al 2020a to investigate the combined impact of the complex composition on anammox and partial denitrification bacteria batch tests were carried out with different nitrogen loading the batch tests performance is shown in fig 1 the batch tests were conducted at increasing nh4 n and no3 n concentrations with the initial nh4 n no3 n ratio at 1 0 the c n were kept at 3 0 in each group results showed that both pd and anammox activities increased with the influent tn increasing from 50 to 100 mg l 1 despite of the salinity increased from 2 g l 1 to 4 g l 1 fig 1 b 1 c the specific no3 n reduction rates r no3 and specific no2 n accumulation rates r no2 achieved as high as 94 0 and 90 9 mg n gvss 1 h 1 respectively this was in accordance with the previous study that the denitrifying bacteria performed relatively higher rates of no3 n reduction than the no2 n reduction facilitating a high no2 n production efficiency that the ntr maintaining above 90 notably the specific nh4 n removal rate r nh4 was not inhibited but significantly improved from 3 3 to 5 9 mg n gvss 1 h 1 while further increasing tn to 300 and 500 mg l 1 with the salinity of 6 and 20 g l 1 had slightly inhibitory effect on the two groups of bacteria corresponding to the decrease in r no3 r no2 and r nh4 when the initial tn concentration was increased to 1400 mg l 1 with extremely high salinity of 56 g l 1 dramatic decrease in r no3 and r no2 to 34 3 and 32 6 mg l 1 were observed but the no2 n production efficiency of pd approach has never been deteriorated and a high level ntr of 86 1 was still obtained on contrary the anammox bacteria maintained a stable activity with r nh4 at a similar level of group with tn of 300 mg l 1 this clearly suggested that both of pd and anammox bacteria in pd a process had a strong tolerance to the combined effect of real pharmaceutical wastewater with high nitrogen and salinity further this also had been illustrated by the calculated contribution of anammox pathway to tn removal in each group was always above 81 results of batch tests demonstrated that the feasibility of the pd a process was a potential approach for treating the industrial wastewater containing high concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and salinity the high no2 n production feature was little affected and thus providing sufficient substrate for anammox bacteria 3 2 long term performance of pd a sbbr treating pharmaceutical wastewater 3 2 1 efficiency and stability of nitrogen removal by pd a sbbr to investigate the efficiency and stability of pd a process during treating real wastewater the pd a sbbr bioreactor was started up and operated continuously for 180 days at ambient temperature the overall operation was divided into four phases according to the type of wastewater synthetic or actual pharmaceutical wastewater and the influent nitrogen concentration fig 2 in phase ⅰ day1 30 synthetic wastewater with average influent nh4 n of 49 9 mg l 1 and no3 n of 51 0 mg l 1 was fed to the reactor with the temperature in range of 23 7 c x223c 19 2 c table 1 the initial c n was 4 0 by adding sodium acetate to provide sufficient organic carbon for partial denitrification in the first week after start up the nh4 n and no3 n removal efficiency was only 16 6 and 31 1 respectively this could be explained by the relatively low activities of seeding sludge after storage at 4 c for over one year previous studies also reported that both anammox and aerobic granular sludge showed low biological activity in the early stage of the reactivation after long term starvation and low temperature storage liu and tay 2008 xiang et al 2022 xing et al 2016 increasing improvement in performance and significant stability was observed from day 30 with the nh4 n and no3 n removal efficiency reached to 83 9 and 100 respectively fig 2 b 2 c moreover tn removal efficiency increased from 14 6 to 82 6 fig 2 d this was attributed to the rapid recovery of denitrifying bacteria which provided sufficient substrate no2 n for anammox moreover the anammox bacteria could be effectively retained and enriched due to the biofilm formation in phase ⅱ day31 50 despite the average temperature decreasing to 16 7 c desirable nitrogen removal performance was achieved with the average efficiency of nh4 n and no3 n removal of 76 5 and 96 2 respectively in phase ⅲ day51 120 the pharmaceutical wastewater was fed to the pd a sbbr with similar influent substrates concentration sufficient no3 n removal performance was observed but the nh4 n accumulated in effluent there might be two reasons for the decreased nh4 n removal efficiency one possible reason might be that the activity of anammox bacteria was inhibited during the long term operation treating real wastewater huang et al 2022 madeira and de araújo 2021 in comparison the denitrifying microorganisms would compete with anammox bacteria and consuming more no2 n another factor would be organic carbon source would be excessive for no3 n reduction to no2 n therefore the c n was reduced to 3 5 and 3 0 at this phase fig 2 a the nh4 n removal increased gradually due to the required c n was reduced from 4 to 3 5 and then to 2 8 this indicated that the denitrifying bacteria was rapidly adapted to the real wastewater and biomass activity for electron donor utilization would be enhanced desirable average efficiency of nh4 n and no3 n removal was maintained at 83 5 and 92 2 respectively fig 2 a 2 c it clearly demonstrated that the high efficiency removal of pharmaceutical wastewater in this reactor was achieved in phase ⅳ day 121 180 increasing nitrogen loading rate was conducted by increasing the influent no3 n and nh4 n to 104 1 4 4 mg l 1and 77 9 2 6 mg l 1 respectively the effluent nh4 n rose up to 24 7 mg l 1 and no2 n in the effluent also risen slightly in comparison the no3 n reduction was little affected similarly the substrate competition between ammonium and pharmaceuticals in a nitrifying culture was observed due to the formed biotransformation products might be more toxic to microorganisms as for the pd a system in this study the anammox bacteria would be more sensitive to the increasing nitrogen loading rates of pharmaceutical wastewater compared to the denitrifying bacteria subsequently the c n was further reduced to 2 6 in accordance with a significantly improved nh4 n removal performance resulting in a sufficient tn removal efficiency still maintaining at 81 2 6 3 furthermore the pd a process could reach the maximum nitrogen removal efficiency of 100 theoretically at influent nh4 n no3 n ratio of approximately 1 0 since the no3 n produced by anammox process was converted to no2 n by pd and responsible for external nh4 n removal to the best of our knowledge the nitrogen removal efficiency was the highest for treating real wastewater with high salts previous study reported that the average tn removal efficiency was 70 3 in an aerobic granular sludge system for treating pharmaceutical wastewater jiang et al 2021 by applying a pn anammox system to treat iron oxide red wastewater the tn removal efficiency was only 70 due to the negative impact of inhibitory factors on anammox bacteria and pn performance feng et al 2019b 3 2 2 cooperated activities of partial denitrification and anammox bacteria robust cooperation between partial denitrification and anammox in treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater was confirmed in this study as shown in the typical cycles of pd a sbbr the no3 n was reduced rapidly in the initial 40 min with the rapid accumulation of no2 n to peak synchronously fig 3 the ntr achieved as high as 95 7 in phase ⅱ both nh4 n and no2 n was removed subsequently with anammox contributing to tn removal of 95 7 when the influent was changed from synthetic wastewater to pharmaceutical wastewater in phase ⅲ and phase ⅳ the ntr of the system was maintained at 99 and 92 1 respectively comparatively the contribution of anammox to tn removal was over 98 in phase ⅲ however it decreased to 73 1 after increasing the influent load fig 3 d although the tn removal by anammox was reduced in phase ⅳ it was still the most dominant pathway in this system in addition to the influence of temperature on the activity of anammox bacteria the inhibitory factors in wastewater also account for a considerable proportion correspondingly the tn removal rate was 89 4 and 67 2 in phase ⅲ and phase ⅳ respectively the activities of anammox and denitrifying bacteria were affected by combined factors of inhibitors and temperature interestingly despite the combined increasing loading rates of influent and low temperature the average ntr maintained at a high level of over 80 fig 3 d in comparison the no2 n reduction by denitrification pathway was improved which was the major reason for the low contribution rate of anammox to tn removal it is planned to continue to reduce c n in future operations to reduce the competition of complete denitrification pathway for no2 n which is the substrate of anammox 3 3 morphological and physiochemical characterization of biofilm the morphological and physicochemical characterization of biofilm and suspended sludge were analyzed including the biomass concentration microstructure observation by sem and particle size distribution of suspended sludge during the 180 days operation the biomass concentration of the biofilm rapidly increased from 0 mg vss l 1 to 5984 7 mg vss l 1 while the suspended biomass concentrations increased from 381 67 mg vss l 1 to 1455 29 mg vss l 1 fig 4 a 4 b the vss ss of biofilm sludge and suspended sludge varied in range of 37 4 x223c 63 8 and 52 1 x223c 66 3 respectively meanwhile the average particle size of suspended sludge in the integrated reactor was always maintained above 400 μm with the biomass of particle size 200 μm accounting for above 50 fig s3 one of the key reasons for such rapid formation of pd a biofilms in the present study was the high aggregation ability of anammox bacteria this was related to the comparatively few hydrophilic components of eps found in the anammox biomass hou et al 2015 jia et al 2017 additionally the effect of mechanical collision among carriers in the fixed bed reactor was weaker than that in the moving bed biofilm reactor facilitating the initial attachment and retention of bacteria li et al 2021 in this case the biomass concentration of biofilm increased to 2038 9 mg vss l 1 on the 50th day during this stage the surface of biofilm visibly turned yellow brown fig s4 a the morphological characteristics with the sem showed the intensively spherical aggregates fig 4 c with a large number of filamentous bacteria on the surface and inside of the biofilm which played a conducive role in stabilizing the biofilm structure the inter structure of sludge aggregates was more porous after feeding with real wastewater after 74 days of treatment of the pharmaceutical wastewater the apparent morphology of the sludge on the carrier biofilm has undergone tremendous changes observed by sem fig 4 c the activated sludge gradually turned dark brown fig s4 b this was mainly due to that the bacteria did not adapt to the influent and decayed during the long term operation resulting in more holes in the biofilm structure this implied that the functional bacteria would be more competitive than the other coexisting bacteria 3 4 response of microbial metabolism to the pharmaceutical wastewater 3 4 1 response of eps production the eps secreted by microorganisms bind to cells through complex interactions and play an important role in sludge granulation and biofilm formation as well as protecting cells from toxic substances sutherland 2001 the variation in the pd a sbbr process conditions in terms of temperature and feeding substrate resulted in different performances in organic degradation as shown in fig 5 the microscopic architecture of biofilm in different phases was observed and it was verified that the bacteria aggregated and grew rapidly as biofilm the concentrations of the main components of biofilm sludge eps including pn and ps were analyzed in different operational phases since there was no organic component in the influent of this bioreactor the measured eps was all produced by cells overall the content of pn was much higher than the ps at each phase and the content of pn was always tb eps lb eps s eps fig 5 c similar results of eps structure were also found in anammox reactors jia et al 2017 wang et al 2020b by using synthetic wastewater total eps was only increased slightly from 143 78 mg g vss 1 to 150 65 mg g vss 1 notably when feeding with the pharmaceutical wastewater lb pn increased significantly from 18 06 mg g vss 1 to 86 48 mg g vss 1 fig 5 c the production of lb eps could be associated with the extracellular redox activity which contributes to the balance between intercellular osmotic pressure and environmental stress of high salt concentration and the relevant metabolic process could be beneficial for the tolerance and utilization of refractory organics more et al 2012 previous reports have also shown that more eps was produced when treating target pharmaceutical wastewater to protect cells from adverse conditions jiang et al 2021 the tb eps facilitates microbial adhesion and aggregation by bridging cells into clusters pellicer nacher et al 2013 in this study the content of tb eps in phase ⅰ phase ⅱ phase ⅲ and phase ⅳ was 107 4 mg g vss 1 122 7 mg g vss 1 127 9 mg g vss 1 and 140 9 mg g vss 1 respectively the steady increase in the content of tb eps indicates that the adhesion and aggregation properties of microorganisms have not been significantly stimulated by changes in the external environment therefore tb eps played a vital role in the pd a system at the same time the high pn ps value of total eps 3 9 6 7 in this study has also been reported in the previous literature feng et al 2019a lotti et al 2019 the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of eps samples in phase ⅱ and phase ⅳ were analyzed separately as shown in fig s5 only two characteristic peaks about the aromatic protein like substances peak a by product like substances e g tryptophan peak b were present in the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of the eps samples it shows that the change of the type of wastewater treatment was not caused by the change of the fluorescent composition of eps subcomponents but only responded to the content 3 4 2 response of eps structure and major component ftir spectroscopy was applied in this study to detect the characteristics of surface functional groups of biofilms and suspended eps sludge under synthetic wastewater day47 and pharmaceutical wastewater day145 respectively fig 6 the amide i band 1700 1600 cm 1 was present in all eps samples which was caused by the co stretching vibrations of the peptide groups in proteins the peak intensities of the three eps samples were significantly different comparing the ftir spectroscopy of phase ⅱ and phase ⅳ biofilm eps samples it was found that the peaks at 3728 cm 1 and 800 cm 1 gradually disappeared fig 6 a 6 d the peak at approximately 2966 cm 1 and 1546 cm 1 began to appear the peak at 1654 cm 1 after feeding pharmaceutical wastewater grew bigger than that during phase ⅱ little differences in eps constituents between biofilm and suspended sludge in addition an obvious peak at approximately 1100 cm 1 is indicative of the presence of polysaccharides badireddy et al 2008 the ftir spectroscopy results indicated that inhibitory substances contained in pharmaceutical wastewater affected the functional groups on the surface of sludge subtle differences in protein secondary structures induced over time were interpreted by resolving the amide i region 1700 1600 cm 1 into component peaks using second derivative analysis and curve fitting procedure fig 6 b 6 f beech et al 1999 buijs et al 1996 as shown in table 3 aggregated strands 1625 1610 cm 1 β sheets 1640 1630 cm 1 random coil 1645 1640 cm 1 α helices 1657 1648 cm 1 3 turn helices 1666 1659 cm 1 and antiparallel β sheets 1695 1680 cm 1 were observed in these samples before treating pharmaceutical wastewater β sheet was not found in lb eps while random coil and 3 turn helix were not found in tb eps besides α helix β sheet random coil was much higher in tb eps 1 9 than lb eps 0 6 which was used to measure the degree of looseness of protein structure hou et al 2015 however when the pharmaceutical wastewater was introduced to the system with high variation of secondary structure i the ratio of antiparallel β sheets has increased significantly ii random coil that has not been seen before appeared in the tb eps and iii α helix β sheet random coil in tb eps decreased from 1 9 to 0 7 that is the complex components in wastewater are the unfavorable factors for the stability of protein structure on the other hand the protein component with the 3 turn helix structure showed an obvious increasing trend when the pharmaceutical wastewater was introduced which was consistent with the efficient nitrogen removal performance and high contribution of anammox bacteria previous study reported that the component of 3 turn helix structure would facilitate the stable structure of biomass aggregates badireddy et al 2010 it was assumed that the key bacteria might synthesize more protein with the 3 turn helix structure in the pda sbbr especially located in the lb eps for high tolerance to the inhibitory condition 3 5 variation of functional genes abundance and enrichment of key bacteria 3 5 1 abundance of functional genes for pd to elucidate the changes of various functional microorganisms in the biofilm and suspended sludge after the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater by the pd a system q pcr was carried out using specific primers for denitrifiers and anammox bacteria the results show that the abundance of anammox bacteria both in biofilms and suspended sludge decreased fig 7 a while the abundance of anammox bacteria in suspended sludge decreased significantly by 1 order of magnitude from 8 29 1011 to 5 36 1010 copies g 1 dry sludge this was an important reason for the decrease in tn removal efficiency and the contribution of anammox to tn removal in phase ⅲ and phase ⅳ of the system this indicates that the growth of anammox bacteria was inhibited when treating pharmaceutical wastewater but the existence of carrier biofilm effectively weakened this inhibition additionally it has not been observed that pharmaceutical wastewater has a significant effect on the growth of functional genes narg nirk and nirs related to the denitrification process that the system can be stably provided substrate no2 n for the anammox process fig 7 b 7 d 3 5 2 microbial community in biofilm and suspended biomass highly enriched partial denitrification bacteria were demonstrated by 16 s rna sequencing the succession of the microbial community on the carrier biofilm and the suspended sludge in the reactor were studied respectively as shown in table s4 the community richness on the carrier biofilm was higher than the suspended sludge after changing the influent to the target pharmaceutical wastewater the community richness decreased in both biofilm and suspended sludge the chao index sobs index and shannon index of suspended sludge samples decreased from 1046 5 923 and 4 8 to 637 8 455 and 2 0 respectively table s4 meanwhile the carrier biofilm samples also decreased from 1122 9 1033 and 5 1 to 1030 883 and 3 7 respectively the decreased in the richness of the microbial community indicates that the target wastewater has an inhibitory effect on certain bacterial communities and leads to the death of microorganisms during the experimental period the relative taxonomic abundance of microbial communities in biofilm and suspended sludge was characterized at phylum level fig 7 e the main phylum in bioreactor including proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and planctomycetes the proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in the bioreactor with the average abundance of 32 2 57 8 and 37 6 68 1 in biofilm and suspended sludge on days 46 and 113 respectively fig 7 e in other words proteobacteria was enriched in the carrier biofilm and suspended sludge during the operation of the reactor on the contrary the bacteroidetes chloroflexi and planctomycetes were found to be inhibited by pharmaceutical wastewater with the significant decrease in the relative abundance this was different from previously reported research jiang et al 2021 fig 7 f shows that the analysis of relative abundance of microbial communities at the genus level although the pharmaceutical wastewater had higher complex inorganic compounds and nitrogen some strains could still overcome the inhibition effects of these components including thauera and flavobacterium genus thaurea belonging to proteobacteria phylum identified as bacteria with denitrification capacity ginige et al 2005 hagman et al 2008 was the main genus of the system and it has been enriched from 9 5 to 43 6 in the carrier biofilm and from 15 5 to 57 5 in the suspended sludge fig 7 f thauera might play a key role in partial denitrification with high and stable no2 n accumulation during no3 n reduction the genera flavobacterium belonged to bacteroidetes enriched from 5 0 to 6 8 in the carrier biofilm and from 1 4 to 20 8 in the suspended sludge the genera candidatus brocadia belonged to planctomycetes was the only identified anammox bacteria with abundance of 7 8 decreased to 1 6 in the biofilm and from 1 8 decreased to 0 1 in the suspended sludge indicated the more efficient retention of biofilm structure in terms of the inhibitory condition this was an important reason for the reduced contribution of anammox to tn removal in the later stage of reactor operation 4 conclusion the feasibility and high efficiency of pd a sbbr treating pharmaceutical wastewater containing no3 n and nh4 n were demonstrated for the first time conclusions can be drawn as follows under the condition of high concentration of no3 n and nh4 n and high salinity in pharmaceutical wastewater the partial denitrification showed high activity and ntr achieved 86 1 in batch tests a high nitrogen removal rate for pharmaceutical wastewater was achieved by applying the novel pd a process during long term operation with the tn removal efficiency above 81 2 and anammox contributed 83 6 to tn removal satisfactory no2 n production ability was confirmed by partial denitrification with the ntr maintaining nearly 100 ensuring sufficient substrate supply to the anammox bacteria bacteria aggregated as biofilm rapidly and the lb eps increased significantly after introducing the real wastewater corresponding to the increase of protein with 3 turn helices structure denitrifying genus thauera showed high tolerence to the pharmaceutical wastewater and was enriched to dominate in both biofilms and suspended sludge which played a key role in the high no2 n accumulation pd a biofilm has been demonstrated to hold the unique advantages of low organic carbon demand high tn removal efficiency as well as the rapid adaption capacity and high tolerance to the complex condition which is emerging as a cost efficient alternative for the

16464,biological nitrogen removal from pharmaceutical wastewater has drawn increasing attention due to biotoxicity and inhibition in this study for the first time a novel approach integrating partial denitrification with anaerobic ammonia oxidation pd a in a sequencing biofilm batch reactor sbbr was proposed and demonstrated to be efficient to treat the bismuth nitrate and bismuth potassium citrate manufacturing wastewater containing ammonia nh4 n and nitrate no3 n of 6300 50 mg l 1 and 15 300 50 mg l 1 the maximum anammox activity was found at the shock effect of influent total nitrogen tn of 100 mg l 1 with no3 n nh4 n of 1 0 long term operation demonstrated that the pd a biofilm was developed rapidly after 30 days using synthetic influent with tn removal efficiency increasing from 40 9 to 80 8 significantly the key bacteria for pd a had high tolerance and adapted rapidly to pharmaceutical wastewater achieving a relatively stable tn removal efficiency of 81 2 with influent nh4 n and no3 n was 77 9 2 6 and 104 1 4 4 mg l 1 at a relatively low cod no3 n of 2 6 anammox pathway contributed to tn removal reached 83 6 significant increase of loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances was obtained with increasing protein of 3 turn helices structure as response to the inhibitory condition high throughput sequencing analysis revealed that the functional genus thauera was highly enriched in both biofilms 9 5 43 6 and suspended biomass 15 5 57 5 which played a key role in high no2 n accumulation while the anammox bacteria decreasing from 7 8 to 1 6 in biofilm and from 1 8 decreased to 0 1 in the suspended sludge overall this study provides a new method of high strength pharmaceutical wastewater treatment with low energy consumption and operation cost as well as a satisfactory efficiency graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pharmaceutical wastewater partial denitrification anammox biofilm functional bacteria enrichment extracellular polymeric substances eps 1 introduction with the rapid development of health medication in recent decades increasing requirement of pharmaceuticals production has attracted the concerns of the public pharmaceutical wastewater has become the serious environment problem due to the potential impacts of high concentrations of refractory organic pollutants inorganic nitrogen compounds and salts on water quality gadipelly et al 2014 wang et al 2020a zhao et al 2019 among these pollutants inorganic nitrogen is of increasing concern because it would cause serious eutrophication and pathogenicity especially the high concentrations of no3 n physical chemical methods have been used to remove different types of pollutants such as the use of ionizing radiation coupled techniques to remove antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance genes args in wastewater chu et al 2021 besides coagulation adsorption air flotation ion exchange and membrane separation methods are also commonly used for organic compounds and heavy metals in pharmaceutical wastewater chen et al 2020a rasouli et al 2017 rathi and kumar 2021 as for nitrogen removal biological treatment methods are undoubtedly the most economical and efficient way to remove nitrogen in wastewater due to its cost saving operation highly efficient and less by products chen et al 2020b qiu et al 2021 however a variety of inhibitory factors have negative effect on microbial activities and limits the efficiency of biological treatment novel technology is strongly needed for different type of pharmaceutical wastewater chelliapan et al 2011 compared to conventional processes for nitrogen removal the anammox process has been regarded as the most cost effective and ecologically acceptable method for biological nitrogen removal from wastewater cao et al 2019c lin and wang 2017 it directly converts nh4 n and no2 n into nitrogen gas n2 with 11 production of no3 n under anoxic conditions it has been successfully used in treatment of ammonium rich wastewaters such as digestion poultry potato processing effluent lackner et al 2014 shi et al 2016 van der star et al 2007 however the anammox bacteria grow slowly doubling time of 10 x223c 30 days and is extremely sensitive to environmental stress e g ph temperature organic matter degraaf et al 1996 fux et al 2004 van der star et al 2008 this usually results in the serious deterioration of nitrogen removal performance weralupitiya et al 2021 more importantly the anammox process not only cannot remove no3 n in the wastewater there is nitrogen residue due to the 11 production of no3 n in this reaction du et al 2019b this limits the application on its own and further combined processes are necessary especially for the industrial wastewater containing high concentration no3 n the partial denitrification pd no3 n no2 n provides promising biological processes for nitrogen removal via anammox technology cao et al 2017 by combining pd and anammox simultaneous removal of high concentration nh4 n and no3 n in synthetic wastewater has been achieved du et al 2019a 2019b compared with the traditional nitrification denitrification process the pd a process requires no aeration energy saves the organic carbon source demand and reduces the sludge output and the greenhouse gas thus has great potential for treating industrial wastewater due to its high removal efficiency for no3 n and nh4 n proved in many reports cao et al 2019a du et al 2016 han et al 2021 to date only few studies have been reported on nitrogen removal from industrial and pharmaceutical wastewater using the anammox which mainly focused on the two stage partial nitrification combining with anammox processes in granular sludge systems daverey et al 2013 shen et al 2012 tang et al 2011 to the best of our knowledge the feasibility and performance of the novel pd a process in single stage biofilm treating the pharmaceutical wastewater contained no3 n and nh4 n has rarely been explored on the other hand the anammox microorganisms might be over competed by denitrifying bacteria and washed out from the system under the inhibitory stress due to its much lower growth rate this would seriously destroy the nitrogen removal performance and even hardly retrieve efficient retention of slow growth bacteria should be considered especially for real industrial wastewater for this reason the formation of biofilms offers an effective alternative for the integrated pd a process which was regarded to retain and reduce the wash out of anammox bacteria fernández et al 2008 gilbert et al 2015 moreover the attached biomass had higher tolerance against toxic compounds compared to the suspended sludge phanwilai et al 2020 therefore a new concept of pd a biofilm was proposed to treat the pharmaceutical wastewater containing high strength no3 n and nh4 n the aim of this work is to develop and explore the integrated pd a process treating actual pharmaceutical wastewater contained no3 n and nh4 n with low ph and high salinity a lab scale pd a sbbr was established for evaluating the long term nitrogen removal performance from real wastewater the variation of biomass properties and microbial community structure as well as the enrichment of key bacteria during biofilm formation period were comprehensively investigated the microbial response of eps to the inhibition from set up to adaption stage feeding with real wastewater were also analyzed results in this work is expected to provide a promising method and in depth understanding of microbial mechanism for the biological treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation this study was conducted in an integrated anoxic fixed bed biofilm sbr made of methyl methacrylate with a working volume of 10 0 l a schematic diagram of the reactor is presented in fig s1 a total of 140 blank carriers were strung together by using stainless steel wire and then fixed into a plastic rack with a 12 6 of packing ratio the carriers were cylinders made of polyethylene with a specific surface area of 500 m2 m3 more characteristics of biofilm carriers were described in table s1 during the operation period the hydraulic retention time hrt of the system was controlled at 20 h each sbbr cycle consisted of 10 min of filling 600 min of mixing 30 min of biomass settling and 10 min of drawing out the liquid the ph value in the influent tank was maintained at 7 0 7 5 by the addition of 5 0 m naoh before being fed into the reactor the reactor operates at ambient temperature without any temperature controller the long term operation was divided into four phases as summarized in table 1 phases ⅰ ⅱ day 1 50 comprised the start up period and stable operation period while phases ⅲ ⅳ day 51 180 the actual pharmaceutical wastewater begins to be treated in the reactor 2 2 wastewater and seeding sludge the influent synthetic wastewater adopted in the startup period contained nh4cl and nano3 with the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n at 50 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 respectively at the same time trace elements and minerals were added to meet the nutritional needs of microbial growth and reproduction the composition of the mineral medium contained kh2po4 30 mg l 1 mgso4 7h2o 140 mg l 1 cacl2 2h2o 140 mg l 1 and 1 ml l 1 trace element solution a and b trace element solution a contained l 1 6 37 g edta 2na 9 15 g feso4 7h2o and trace element solution b contained l 1 19 1 g edta 2na 0 24 g cocl2 6h2o 0 25 g cuso4 5h2o 0 22 g namoo4 2h2o 0 19 g nicl2 6h2o 0 014 g h3bo4 0 43 g znso4 7h2o 0 99 g mncl2 4h2o sodium acetate was added to provide sufficient electron donor which was regarded as the easily degradable and commonly used carbon source in wastewater treatment plants cao et al 2019b du et al 2017 the sodium acetate solution 75 g cod l 1 was prepared in a vessel and was fed into the reactor with a peristaltic pump at the beginning of each cycle pharmaceutical wastewater was used for batch tests and long term operation of the pd a reactor the wastewater was collected from a pharmaceutical manufacture plant in southern china which contained no3 n nh4 n and complex organic acid as main pollutants with high salinity since the wastewater from different production lines was mixed before going to be treated the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations were measured not only for each line but also for the mixture influent nh4 n and no3 n concentrations before dilution reached up to 6300 50 mg l 1 and 15 300 50 mg l 1 respectively while the biodegradable organic matter was at a low level table s2 the inoculated sludge used in this experiment was collected from a pd a sbr that had been operated stably for two years in our laboratory the parental reactor achieved a high tn removal efficiency of over 93 by feeding with synthetic wastewater containing nh4 n and no3 n and candidatus brocadia was the only identified anammox bacteria zhang et al 2019 the initial concentrations of the volatile suspended solids vss and total suspended solids tss after inoculation were 0 38 and 0 89 g l 1 respectively during the experiment the suspended sludge was attached to the blank carriers and the formation of biofilm was observed gradually 2 3 batch experiments five batch tests were implemented before the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater to verify the feasibility of the pd a sbbr to treat this type of wastewater the experimental conditions are summarized in table 2 the impact of pharmaceutical wastewater on ammonia oxidizing bacteria and denitrifying bacteria was investigated through batch tests the details of the batch tests are as follows the batch tests were each conducted in a serum bottle with a working volume of 500 ml during the batch test the magnetic stirrer rotation speed was controlled at 150 rpm min 1 to keep the sludge suspended the whole process was carried out in a constant temperature incubator at 28 c fig s2 wash the sludge at the end of the reaction from the reactor three times with distilled water to wash away the remaining substrate subsequently a specific volume of pharmaceutical wastewater was injected into the bottle to acquire initial no3 n concentrations in the range of 25 700 mg l 1 at the same time a certain volume of nh4 n 10 g l 1 was added to kept the ratio of no3 n nh4 n in the water at 1 0 the ratio of cod no3 n c n in bottle was maintained at 3 0 during the whole test sodium acetate is the same type of carbon source added in the reactor for a long time during the batch tests 2 ml of suspensions from the bottles were collected at appropriate time intervals from 5 to 60 min and filtered to measure the concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and no2 n 2 4 calculations 2 4 1 contributions of anammox and denitrification to total nitrogen removal the generally stoichiometric equations of anammox were used to calculate the contribution of different pathways according to the previous studies and the nitrogen loading in this study du et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the determination of anammox and denitrification contribution to nitrogen removal of pd a sbbr was performed according to the eqs 1 2 anammox percentage 1 inf nh 4 eff nh 4 1 32 inf nh 4 eff nh 4 100 inf tn eff tn the inf nh4 and eff nh4 were the nh4 n concentration in the influent and effluent during long term operation respectively the inf tn and eff tn were referred to tn concentration in the influent and effluent the tn included nh4 n no3 n and no2 n denitrification percentage 2 inf no 3 eff no 3 1 32 inf nh 4 eff nh 4 0 26 inf nh 4 eff nh 4 100 inf tn eff tn the inf no3 and eff no3 were the no3 n concentration influent and effluent during long term operation respectively it was assumed that the nitrogen assimilation due to heterotrophic growth was neglected in the calculations 2 4 2 ntr in partial denitrification process the conversion rate of no3 n to no2 n can be expressed as eq 3 ntr 3 c t no 2 c amx t no 2 c 0 no 2 100 c 0 no 3 c amx t no 3 c t no 3 where ct no2 represents the maximum no2 n production at time t c0 no2 was the initial no2 n concentration in a cycle and the camx t no2 was the consumed no2 n by anammox reaction in theory at time t c0 no3 was the initial no3 n concentration ct no3 was the concentration of no3 n at time t and camx t no3 was the produced no3 n in anammox reaction at time t in a cycle 2 4 3 kinetics in batch experiments during the experiment the partial denitrification activity was represented by specific no3 n reduction rates r no3 and no2 n accumulation rates r no2 the anammox activity was identified by specific nh4 n depletion rates r nh4 as shown in eqs 4 to 7 du et al 2020 4 r no 3 dn o 3 dt δ n o 3 mlvss δ t 1 5

particle analyzer microtrac s3500 u s scanning electron microscope sem was used to observe the morphology and structure of microorganisms in biofilms with an sem device gemini sem 300 germany 2 6 eps extraction and chemical analysis the metabolic responses of bacteria to the inhibitory stress by feeding with pharmaceutical wastewater were analyzed this could be reflected by the production and composition of eps in biofilm during the steady state of each phase the three sub fractions of eps soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were extracted using a modified heat method li and yang 2007 zhao et al 2016 and phenol sulfuric acid methods were used to determine the contents of protein pn and polysaccharides ps in eps samples to analyze the major functional groups in the eps samples the extracted eps was determined by 3d eem perkinelmer ls55 u k and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectrometer thermo fisher scientific nicolet is10 u s the amide i region 1700 1600 cm 1 in the eps was further analyzed to extract information regarding protein secondary structures furthermore the second derivative spectra and deconvolution spectra

suspended sludge were freeze dried freezone labonco corp us under vacuum and genomic dna was extracted by a fastdna spin kit for soil bio101 vista ca usa referring to the manufacturer s instructions the abundance of anammox bacteria functional genes including nitrate reductase narg cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase nirs and cu containing nitrite reductase nirk for denitrifiers were evaluated by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr the primer sequence 5 3 and amplification program were provided in table s3 biofilm and suspended sludge samples from phase ⅱ day 46 and phase ⅲ

spin kits for soil mp biomedicals usa according to a modified manufacturer s protocol the pcr reaction and high throughput sequencing were conducted using methods described in our previous work du et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 shocking effect of pharmaceutical wastewater on pd and anammox bacteria there were several studies that reported that the bacteria might be inhibited seriously when treating industrial wastewater due to the long term harmful effects of complex pollutants such as antibiotics metal ions and organic acid dehboudeh et al 2020 qi et al 2020 wang et al 2020a to investigate the combined impact of the complex composition on anammox and partial denitrification bacteria batch tests were carried out with different nitrogen loading the batch tests performance is shown in fig 1 the batch tests were conducted at increasing nh4 n and no3 n concentrations with the initial nh4 n no3 n ratio at 1 0 the c n were kept at 3 0 in each group results showed that both pd and anammox activities increased with the influent tn increasing from 50 to 100 mg l 1 despite of the salinity increased from 2 g l 1 to 4 g l 1 fig 1 b 1 c the specific no3 n reduction rates r no3 and specific no2 n accumulation rates r no2 achieved as high as 94 0 and 90 9 mg n gvss 1 h 1 respectively this was in accordance with the previous study that the denitrifying bacteria performed relatively higher rates of no3 n reduction than the no2 n reduction facilitating a high no2 n production efficiency that the ntr maintaining above 90 notably the specific nh4 n removal rate r nh4 was not inhibited but significantly improved from 3 3 to 5 9 mg n gvss 1 h 1 while further increasing tn to 300 and 500 mg l 1 with the salinity of 6 and 20 g l 1 had slightly inhibitory effect on the two groups of bacteria corresponding to the decrease in r no3 r no2 and r nh4 when the initial tn concentration was increased to 1400 mg l 1 with extremely high salinity of 56 g l 1 dramatic decrease in r no3 and r no2 to 34 3 and 32 6 mg l 1 were observed but the no2 n production efficiency of pd approach has never been deteriorated and a high level ntr of 86 1 was still obtained on contrary the anammox bacteria maintained a stable activity with r nh4 at a similar level of group with tn of 300 mg l 1 this clearly suggested that both of pd and anammox bacteria in pd a process had a strong tolerance to the combined effect of real pharmaceutical wastewater with high nitrogen and salinity further this also had been illustrated by the calculated contribution of anammox pathway to tn removal in each group was always above 81 results of batch tests demonstrated that the feasibility of the pd a process was a potential approach for treating the industrial wastewater containing high concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and salinity the high no2 n production feature was little affected and thus providing sufficient substrate for anammox bacteria 3 2 long term performance of pd a sbbr treating pharmaceutical wastewater 3 2 1 efficiency and stability of nitrogen removal by pd a sbbr to investigate the efficiency and stability of pd a process during treating real wastewater the pd a sbbr bioreactor was started up and operated continuously for 180 days at ambient temperature the overall operation was divided into four phases according to the type of wastewater synthetic or actual pharmaceutical wastewater and the influent nitrogen concentration fig 2 in phase ⅰ day1 30 synthetic wastewater with average influent nh4 n of 49 9 mg l 1 and no3 n of 51 0 mg l 1 was fed to the reactor with the temperature in range of 23 7 c x223c 19 2 c table 1 the initial c n was 4 0 by adding sodium acetate to provide sufficient organic carbon for partial denitrification in the first week after start up the nh4 n and no3 n removal efficiency was only 16 6 and 31 1 respectively this could be explained by the relatively low activities of seeding sludge after storage at 4 c for over one year previous studies also reported that both anammox and aerobic granular sludge showed low biological activity in the early stage of the reactivation after long term starvation and low temperature storage liu and tay 2008 xiang et al 2022 xing et al 2016 increasing improvement in performance and significant stability was observed from day 30 with the nh4 n and no3 n removal efficiency reached to 83 9 and 100 respectively fig 2 b 2 c moreover tn removal efficiency increased from 14 6 to 82 6 fig 2 d this was attributed to the rapid recovery of denitrifying bacteria which provided sufficient substrate no2 n for anammox moreover the anammox bacteria could be effectively retained and enriched due to the biofilm formation in phase ⅱ day31 50 despite the average temperature decreasing to 16 7 c desirable nitrogen removal performance was achieved with the average efficiency of nh4 n and no3 n removal of 76 5 and 96 2 respectively in phase ⅲ day51 120 the pharmaceutical wastewater was fed to the pd a sbbr with similar influent substrates concentration sufficient no3 n removal performance was observed but the nh4 n accumulated in effluent there might be two reasons for the decreased nh4 n removal efficiency one possible reason might be that the activity of anammox bacteria was inhibited during the long term operation treating real wastewater huang et al 2022 madeira and de araújo 2021 in comparison the denitrifying microorganisms would compete with anammox bacteria and consuming more no2 n another factor would be organic carbon source would be excessive for no3 n reduction to no2 n therefore the c n was reduced to 3 5 and 3 0 at this phase fig 2 a the nh4 n removal increased gradually due to the required c n was reduced from 4 to 3 5 and then to 2 8 this indicated that the denitrifying bacteria was rapidly adapted to the real wastewater and biomass activity for electron donor utilization would be enhanced desirable average efficiency of nh4 n and no3 n removal was maintained at 83 5 and 92 2 respectively fig 2 a 2 c it clearly demonstrated that the high efficiency removal of pharmaceutical wastewater in this reactor was achieved in phase ⅳ day 121 180 increasing nitrogen loading rate was conducted by increasing the influent no3 n and nh4 n to 104 1 4 4 mg l 1and 77 9 2 6 mg l 1 respectively the effluent nh4 n rose up to 24 7 mg l 1 and no2 n in the effluent also risen slightly in comparison the no3 n reduction was little affected similarly the substrate competition between ammonium and pharmaceuticals in a nitrifying culture was observed due to the formed biotransformation products might be more toxic to microorganisms as for the pd a system in this study the anammox bacteria would be more sensitive to the increasing nitrogen loading rates of pharmaceutical wastewater compared to the denitrifying bacteria subsequently the c n was further reduced to 2 6 in accordance with a significantly improved nh4 n removal performance resulting in a sufficient tn removal efficiency still maintaining at 81 2 6 3 furthermore the pd a process could reach the maximum nitrogen removal efficiency of 100 theoretically at influent nh4 n no3 n ratio of approximately 1 0 since the no3 n produced by anammox process was converted to no2 n by pd and responsible for external nh4 n removal to the best of our knowledge the nitrogen removal efficiency was the highest for treating real wastewater with high salts previous study reported that the average tn removal efficiency was 70 3 in an aerobic granular sludge system for treating pharmaceutical wastewater jiang et al 2021 by applying a pn anammox system to treat iron oxide red wastewater the tn removal efficiency was only 70 due to the negative impact of inhibitory factors on anammox bacteria and pn performance feng et al 2019b 3 2 2 cooperated activities of partial denitrification and anammox bacteria robust cooperation between partial denitrification and anammox in treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater was confirmed in this study as shown in the typical cycles of pd a sbbr the no3 n was reduced rapidly in the initial 40 min with the rapid accumulation of no2 n to peak synchronously fig 3 the ntr achieved as high as 95 7 in phase ⅱ both nh4 n and no2 n was removed subsequently with anammox contributing to tn removal of 95 7 when the influent was changed from synthetic wastewater to pharmaceutical wastewater in phase ⅲ and phase ⅳ the ntr of the system was maintained at 99 and 92 1 respectively comparatively the contribution of anammox to tn removal was over 98 in phase ⅲ however it decreased to 73 1 after increasing the influent load fig 3 d although the tn removal by anammox was reduced in phase ⅳ it was still the most dominant pathway in this system in addition to the influence of temperature on the activity of anammox bacteria the inhibitory factors in wastewater also account for a considerable proportion correspondingly the tn removal rate was 89 4 and 67 2 in phase ⅲ and phase ⅳ respectively the activities of anammox and denitrifying bacteria were affected by combined factors of inhibitors and temperature interestingly despite the combined increasing loading rates of influent and low temperature the average ntr maintained at a high level of over 80 fig 3 d in comparison the no2 n reduction by denitrification pathway was improved which was the major reason for the low contribution rate of anammox to tn removal it is planned to continue to reduce c n in future operations to reduce the competition of complete denitrification pathway for no2 n which is the substrate of anammox 3 3 morphological and physiochemical characterization of biofilm the morphological and physicochemical characterization of biofilm and suspended sludge were analyzed including the biomass concentration microstructure observation by sem and particle size distribution of suspended sludge during the 180 days operation the biomass concentration of the biofilm rapidly increased from 0 mg vss l 1 to 5984 7 mg vss l 1 while the suspended biomass concentrations increased from 381 67 mg vss l 1 to 1455 29 mg vss l 1 fig 4 a 4 b the vss ss of biofilm sludge and suspended sludge varied in range of 37 4 x223c 63 8 and 52 1 x223c 66 3 respectively meanwhile the average particle size of suspended sludge in the integrated reactor was always maintained above 400 μm with the biomass of particle size 200 μm accounting for above 50 fig s3 one of the key reasons for such rapid formation of pd a biofilms in the present study was the high aggregation ability of anammox bacteria this was related to the comparatively few hydrophilic components of eps found in the anammox biomass hou et al 2015 jia et al 2017 additionally the effect of mechanical collision among carriers in the fixed bed reactor was weaker than that in the moving bed biofilm reactor facilitating the initial attachment and retention of bacteria li et al 2021 in this case the biomass concentration of biofilm increased to 2038 9 mg vss l 1 on the 50th day during this stage the surface of biofilm visibly turned yellow brown fig s4 a the morphological characteristics with the sem showed the intensively spherical aggregates fig 4 c with a large number of filamentous bacteria on the surface and inside of the biofilm which played a conducive role in stabilizing the biofilm structure the inter structure of sludge aggregates was more porous after feeding with real wastewater after 74 days of treatment of the pharmaceutical wastewater the apparent morphology of the sludge on the carrier biofilm has undergone tremendous changes observed by sem fig 4 c the activated sludge gradually turned dark brown fig s4 b this was mainly due to that the bacteria did not adapt to the influent and decayed during the long term operation resulting in more holes in the biofilm structure this implied that the functional bacteria would be more competitive than the other coexisting bacteria 3 4 response of microbial metabolism to the pharmaceutical wastewater 3 4 1 response of eps production the eps secreted by microorganisms bind to cells through complex interactions and play an important role in sludge granulation and biofilm formation as well as protecting cells from toxic substances sutherland 2001 the variation in the pd a sbbr process conditions in terms of temperature and feeding substrate resulted in different performances in organic degradation as shown in fig 5 the microscopic architecture of biofilm in different phases was observed and it was verified that the bacteria aggregated and grew rapidly as biofilm the concentrations of the main components of biofilm sludge eps including pn and ps were analyzed in different operational phases since there was no organic component in the influent of this bioreactor the measured eps was all produced by cells overall the content of pn was much higher than the ps at each phase and the content of pn was always tb eps lb eps s eps fig 5 c similar results of eps structure were also found in anammox reactors jia et al 2017 wang et al 2020b by using synthetic wastewater total eps was only increased slightly from 143 78 mg g vss 1 to 150 65 mg g vss 1 notably when feeding with the pharmaceutical wastewater lb pn increased significantly from 18 06 mg g vss 1 to 86 48 mg g vss 1 fig 5 c the production of lb eps could be associated with the extracellular redox activity which contributes to the balance between intercellular osmotic pressure and environmental stress of high salt concentration and the relevant metabolic process could be beneficial for the tolerance and utilization of refractory organics more et al 2012 previous reports have also shown that more eps was produced when treating target pharmaceutical wastewater to protect cells from adverse conditions jiang et al 2021 the tb eps facilitates microbial adhesion and aggregation by bridging cells into clusters pellicer nacher et al 2013 in this study the content of tb eps in phase ⅰ phase ⅱ phase ⅲ and phase ⅳ was 107 4 mg g vss 1 122 7 mg g vss 1 127 9 mg g vss 1 and 140 9 mg g vss 1 respectively the steady increase in the content of tb eps indicates that the adhesion and aggregation properties of microorganisms have not been significantly stimulated by changes in the external environment therefore tb eps played a vital role in the pd a system at the same time the high pn ps value of total eps 3 9 6 7 in this study has also been reported in the previous literature feng et al 2019a lotti et al 2019 the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of eps samples in phase ⅱ and phase ⅳ were analyzed separately as shown in fig s5 only two characteristic peaks about the aromatic protein like substances peak a by product like substances e g tryptophan peak b were present in the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of the eps samples it shows that the change of the type of wastewater treatment was not caused by the change of the fluorescent composition of eps subcomponents but only responded to the content 3 4 2 response of eps structure and major component ftir spectroscopy was applied in this study to detect the characteristics of surface functional groups of biofilms and suspended eps sludge under synthetic wastewater day47 and pharmaceutical wastewater day145 respectively fig 6 the amide i band 1700 1600 cm 1 was present in all eps samples which was caused by the co stretching vibrations of the peptide groups in proteins the peak intensities of the three eps samples were significantly different comparing the ftir spectroscopy of phase ⅱ and phase ⅳ biofilm eps samples it was found that the peaks at 3728 cm 1 and 800 cm 1 gradually disappeared fig 6 a 6 d the peak at approximately 2966 cm 1 and 1546 cm 1 began to appear the peak at 1654 cm 1 after feeding pharmaceutical wastewater grew bigger than that during phase ⅱ little differences in eps constituents between biofilm and suspended sludge in addition an obvious peak at approximately 1100 cm 1 is indicative of the presence of polysaccharides badireddy et al 2008 the ftir spectroscopy results indicated that inhibitory substances contained in pharmaceutical wastewater affected the functional groups on the surface of sludge subtle differences in protein secondary structures induced over time were interpreted by resolving the amide i region 1700 1600 cm 1 into component peaks using second derivative analysis and curve fitting procedure fig 6 b 6 f beech et al 1999 buijs et al 1996 as shown in table 3 aggregated strands 1625 1610 cm 1 β sheets 1640 1630 cm 1 random coil 1645 1640 cm 1 α helices 1657 1648 cm 1 3 turn helices 1666 1659 cm 1 and antiparallel β sheets 1695 1680 cm 1 were observed in these samples before treating pharmaceutical wastewater β sheet was not found in lb eps while random coil and 3 turn helix were not found in tb eps besides α helix β sheet random coil was much higher in tb eps 1 9 than lb eps 0 6 which was used to measure the degree of looseness of protein structure hou et al 2015 however when the pharmaceutical wastewater was introduced to the system with high variation of secondary structure i the ratio of antiparallel β sheets has increased significantly ii random coil that has not been seen before appeared in the tb eps and iii α helix β sheet random coil in tb eps decreased from 1 9 to 0 7 that is the complex components in wastewater are the unfavorable factors for the stability of protein structure on the other hand the protein component with the 3 turn helix structure showed an obvious increasing trend when the pharmaceutical wastewater was introduced which was consistent with the efficient nitrogen removal performance and high contribution of anammox bacteria previous study reported that the component of 3 turn helix structure would facilitate the stable structure of biomass aggregates badireddy et al 2010 it was assumed that the key bacteria might synthesize more protein with the 3 turn helix structure in the pda sbbr especially located in the lb eps for high tolerance to the inhibitory condition 3 5 variation of functional genes abundance and enrichment of key bacteria 3 5 1 abundance of functional genes for pd to elucidate the changes of various functional microorganisms in the biofilm and suspended sludge after the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater by the pd a system q pcr was carried out using specific primers for denitrifiers and anammox bacteria the results show that the abundance of anammox bacteria both in biofilms and suspended sludge decreased fig 7 a while the abundance of anammox bacteria in suspended sludge decreased significantly by 1 order of magnitude from 8 29 1011 to 5 36 1010 copies g 1 dry sludge this was an important reason for the decrease in tn removal efficiency and the contribution of anammox to tn removal in phase ⅲ and phase ⅳ of the system this indicates that the growth of anammox bacteria was inhibited when treating pharmaceutical wastewater but the existence of carrier biofilm effectively weakened this inhibition additionally it has not been observed that pharmaceutical wastewater has a significant effect on the growth of functional genes narg nirk and nirs related to the denitrification process that the system can be stably provided substrate no2 n for the anammox process fig 7 b 7 d 3 5 2 microbial community in biofilm and suspended biomass highly enriched partial denitrification bacteria were demonstrated by 16 s rna sequencing the succession of the microbial community on the carrier biofilm and the suspended sludge in the reactor were studied respectively as shown in table s4 the community richness on the carrier biofilm was higher than the suspended sludge after changing the influent to the target pharmaceutical wastewater the community richness decreased in both biofilm and suspended sludge the chao index sobs index and shannon index of suspended sludge samples decreased from 1046 5 923 and 4 8 to 637 8 455 and 2 0 respectively table s4 meanwhile the carrier biofilm samples also decreased from 1122 9 1033 and 5 1 to 1030 883 and 3 7 respectively the decreased in the richness of the microbial community indicates that the target wastewater has an inhibitory effect on certain bacterial communities and leads to the death of microorganisms during the experimental period the relative taxonomic abundance of microbial communities in biofilm and suspended sludge was characterized at phylum level fig 7 e the main phylum in bioreactor including proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and planctomycetes the proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in the bioreactor with the average abundance of 32 2 57 8 and 37 6 68 1 in biofilm and suspended sludge on days 46 and 113 respectively fig 7 e in other words proteobacteria was enriched in the carrier biofilm and suspended sludge during the operation of the reactor on the contrary the bacteroidetes chloroflexi and planctomycetes were found to be inhibited by pharmaceutical wastewater with the significant decrease in the relative abundance this was different from previously reported research jiang et al 2021 fig 7 f shows that the analysis of relative abundance of microbial communities at the genus level although the pharmaceutical wastewater had higher complex inorganic compounds and nitrogen some strains could still overcome the inhibition effects of these components including thauera and flavobacterium genus thaurea belonging to proteobacteria phylum identified as bacteria with denitrification capacity ginige et al 2005 hagman et al 2008 was the main genus of the system and it has been enriched from 9 5 to 43 6 in the carrier biofilm and from 15 5 to 57 5 in the suspended sludge fig 7 f thauera might play a key role in partial denitrification with high and stable no2 n accumulation during no3 n reduction the genera flavobacterium belonged to bacteroidetes enriched from 5 0 to 6 8 in the carrier biofilm and from 1 4 to 20 8 in the suspended sludge the genera candidatus brocadia belonged to planctomycetes was the only identified anammox bacteria with abundance of 7 8 decreased to 1 6 in the biofilm and from 1 8 decreased to 0 1 in the suspended sludge indicated the more efficient retention of biofilm structure in terms of the inhibitory condition this was an important reason for the reduced contribution of anammox to tn removal in the later stage of reactor operation 4 conclusion the feasibility and high efficiency of pd a sbbr treating pharmaceutical wastewater containing no3 n and nh4 n were demonstrated for the first time conclusions can be drawn as follows under the condition of high concentration of no3 n and nh4 n and high salinity in pharmaceutical wastewater the partial denitrification showed high activity and ntr achieved 86 1 in batch tests a high nitrogen removal rate for pharmaceutical wastewater was achieved by applying the novel pd a process during long term operation with the tn removal efficiency above 81 2 and anammox contributed 83 6 to tn removal satisfactory no2 n production ability was confirmed by partial denitrification with the ntr maintaining nearly 100 ensuring sufficient substrate supply to the anammox bacteria bacteria aggregated as biofilm rapidly and the lb eps increased significantly after introducing the real wastewater corresponding to the increase of protein with 3 turn helices structure denitrifying genus thauera showed high tolerence to the pharmaceutical wastewater and was enriched to dominate in both biofilms and suspended sludge which played a key role in the high no2 n accumulation pd a biofilm has been demonstrated to hold the unique advantages of low organic carbon demand high tn removal efficiency as well as the rapid adaption capacity and high tolerance to the complex condition which is emerging as a cost efficient alternative for the
