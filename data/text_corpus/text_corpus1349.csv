6745,piano key weirs pkws are acquired and developed for free surface control structures which improve their performance by increasing the storage capacity and flood evacuation in this study the potential combinations of two popular artificial intelligence data driven models ai ddms of multi layer perceptron neural network mlpnn and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis with four meta heuristic optimization algorithms particle swarm optimization genetic algorithm firefly algorithm moth flame optimization are assessed for predicting the pkw s flow rate comparing the outcomes of the ten standard and hybrid ai ddms with three empirical relations based on several statistics and diagnostic analysis such as the taylor diagram for estimating the flow rate shows that the ai ddms can predict the passing flow more accurately in addition the particle swarm optimization and firefly algorithm meta heuristic algorithms improve the performance of anfis and mlpnn respectively the mann whitney test for investigating the differences between two independent applied models indicates a significant difference between the ai ddms and two of the empirical relations at the 95 confidence

the reservoirs the escalation in probable maximum storm amplitudes and the need for dam safety some of the existing spillways weirs are seemed to be undersized and need to be replaced kabiri samani and javaheri 2012 anderson 2011 generally there are three remedies to increase the discharge efficiency considering the discharge coefficient of the standard weir equation of a spillway weir limited by a maximum elevation of the free surface water a increasing the width of the spillway weir b lowering the elevation of the weir crest and or 3 substituting the linear weir with a nonlinear weir such as piano key weir pkw type in order to increase the length in the weir footprint anderson 2011 leite ribeiro et all 2012a increasing the length of a linear weir spillway introduced as the first remedy is often impractical because of dam geometry and economic issues moreover lowering the elevation of the dam crest introduced as the second remedy would decrease the normal elevation of the pool reservoir which results in the reduction of the amount of water storage available however the third remedy which is the usage of non linear weirs such as pkw seems to be the only proper and accepted approach anderson and tullis 2012a b 2013 if a dam or any other hydraulic structure cannot adequately pass the updated flood the structure requires modification by increasing the flood storage space and or increasing the spillway capacity therefore one of the innovative and effective ways to increase weir capacity is to use a nonlinear weir such as labyrinth weirs or pkws a labyrinth weir fig 1 is known as a non linear weir which is oriented in zigzag form would increase the length of the weir in comparison to a linear sharp crested weir according to the scientific reports the increase in the length of a labyrinth weir can increase the efficiency of the discharge by 3 4 times compared to a linear weir tullis et al 1995 piano key weirs are developed as alternatives to the labyrinthine weirs and have been designed explicitly for the application of control structure footprint chi hien et al 2006a b lemperiere and ouamane 2003 likewise the labyrinth weirs it is claimed that pkws can increase the flow discharge capacity by up to four times compared to a traditional sharp crested weir lemperiere and ouamane 2003 fig 1 depicts the two main differences between the traditional trapezoidal labyrinth weirs and pkws which are 1 pkws have a rectangular crest layout a plan view like a labyrinth weir with θ 0 and 2 pkws have sloped ramped inlet and outlet key floors 1 2 literature review the literature review of the associated topics of this study can be divided into two main categories of 1 experimental studies for pkws flow simulation and 2 the application of artificial intelligence data driven models ai ddms in modelling flow behaviour or geometric characteristics of weirs including the pkws considering studies associated with the experimental modelling of pkws several researchers have investigated the effect of geometric parameters on the discharge capacity of pkws chi hien et al 2006a b ouamane and lempérière 2006 machiels et al 2011a b anderson 2011 pralong et al 2011 leite ribeiro et al 2012a b kabiri samani and javaheri 2012 machiels et al 2013 mehboudi et al 2016 al shukur and al khafaji 2018 khassaf and al baghdadi 2018 lempérière and jun 2005 and hien et al 2006 suggested that an optimal design for a pkw is reached whenever the wi wo 1 2 where wi and wo are the inlet and outlet key width see fig 1 hien et al 2006 found that pkw geometry is generally more efficient than labyrinth weir for nappe aeration due to its overhanging geometry in accordance with the main topic of this paper the following recent studies on using ai ddms for simulating hydraulic phenomena can be mentioned baptist et al 2007 applied the genetic programming gp to the results of a numerical model in order to obtain an expression for roughness based on synthetic data for the description of vegetation induced roughness harris et al 2014 conducted laboratory experiments and recorded observed flow data in compound channels with vegetated floodplains and used gp for predicting compound channels velocity zounemat kermani et al 2018 simulated the incipient motion velocity of bed sediments using various ai ddms and claimed these methods are more accurate than empirical relations giustolisi 2004 used gp to determine chezy resistance coefficient for full circular corrugated channels and showed that the gp supplies equations more efficient than the monomial equations dursun et al 2012 estimated the discharge coefficient of semi elliptical labyrinth side weir using the anfis model the performance of the anfis model was compared with the multiple linear regression and nonlinear regression models comparison results indicated that the anfis model can be successfully utilized in modelling the discharge coefficient zaji et al 2016 applied the hybrid support vector regression model and firefly optimization algorithm svr fa to predict the discharge coefficient of labyrinth side weirs the results indicated that the svr fa model is about 10 more accurate than the svr model according to the rmse criterion haghbi et al 2017 predicted the discharge coefficient of triangular labyrinth weirs using artificial neural network ann and anfis models comparing the results of the ann with anfis model indicated that both models have acceptable performance however the structure of anfis model is optimal olyaie et al 2018 used several ai ddms ann gene expression programming extreme learning machine and least square support vector machine for estimating the discharge coefficient of pkws comparison of the results showed that the extreme learning machine and lssvm models were able to produce better results than the other ai ddms and could be employed successfully in modelling discharge coefficient from the available experimental data 1 3 objectives and contribution of the study according to the literature review several researchers applied and evaluated ai ddms in modelling the geometric characteristics and hydraulic behavior of weirs spillways in this study the discharge capacity of pkws type a is estimated by using ten standard and hybrid ai ddms including multi layer perceptron neural network with the levenberg marquardt algorithm 1 mlpnn lm hybrid mlpnn with four meta heuristic optimization methods including the genetic algorithm 2 mlpnn ga particle swarm optimization 3 mlpnn pso firefly algorithm 4 mlpnn fa and moth flame optimization 5 mlpnn mfo in addition to the neural network models the standard adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system with the conjugate gradient descent algorithm 6 anfis cgd as well as four hybrid anfis models 7 anfis ga 8 anfis pso 9 anfis fa and 10 anfis mfo are also applied to the modelling process in accordance with the above mentioned description the major contributions of this study can be described as 1 as a matter of fact several studies have been accomplished using ai methods for modelling flow over the spillways and outlet works however the application of ai ddms for exploring the hydraulic behavior of the passing flow over the pkws are rare see table 7 hence the results of this study would help to reach a better conclusion about the precision of ai ddms in modelling the phenomenon 2 this study considers a variety of meta heuristic optimization algorithms for challenging the mlpnn and anfis models in modelling the flow capacity over spillways and weirs henceforth the outcomes of this study will not only be restricted to the analysis of the hydraulic aspects of the modelling procedure but also the assessment of the efficiency of hybrid ai ddms for both the accuracy and computational costs perspective 2 materials and methods 2 1 general hydraulic issues of pkws and the presented empirical relations in this section a brief overview of the characteristics of the passing flow over pkws is given together with the existing knowledge about the hydraulics of the domain and constructing the ann and anfis models to compute the discharge

leite ribeiro et al 2012a b 1 q w 2 3 c d w 2 g h 3 where qw is the weir discharge cd is the discharge coefficient g is the gravity acceleration w stands for the channel width and h denotes the upstream head on the weir fig 2 shows the geometric and hydraulic characteristics of the flow passing the pkw some researchers express the modified discharge coefficient cdl referring to the developed crest length for the pkw leite ribeiro et al 2012a b 2 q pkw 2 3 c dl l 2 g h 3 in this respect kabiri samani and javaheri 2012 suggested the following relation for estimating the discharge

tests attained to velocity pressure froude number and water level profiles presented relations for inlet key discharge qd outlet key discharge qu side discharge qs and total discharge qpkw of the pkws the final proposed relation for estimating the pkw discharge is as follows 6 q q pkw w q u w i w u q d w i w u q s 2 b w u k wo k wi w u w i w o 2 t s where ts is the wall thickness and wu is the cycle width 2 2 data driven models in this section a brief review on the applied ai ddms including the mlpnn and anfis models is presented complete description and information about these models can be found in many related reports such as remesan and mathew 2016 esen and inalli 2010 bilgehan 2011 2 3 mlp neural network artificial neural networks ann are soft computing methods which provide a flexible computational framework for a wide range of nonlinear problems one of the obvious advantages of these models to mathematical non linear models is that the anns are global approximator that can approximate any type of function with desired precision typically multi layer perceptron neural networks mlpnn include a set of processor units neurons that consist of an input layer one or more hidden layers and an output layer in these types of neural networks the input signals propagate through the network and in the forward direction in a layer to layer procedure zounemat kermani et al 2013 in mlpnns with one hidden layer similar to the used one in this study the predicted value y net is calculated as follows 7 y net b 0 j 1 m w j φ b 0 j i 1 k w ji x i where b0 is the bias w represents the weights m is the number of hidden nodes xi is the input variables k is the number of inputs and φ is the transfer function piotrowski et al 2015 in this study hyperbolic tangent sigmoid and log sigmoid activation functions are used in the hidden and output layers respectively 2 4 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system neuro fuzzy hybrid systems have the advantages of fuzzy systems and neural networks neuro fuzzy modeling describes the behavior of a system with fuzzy logic rules within the structure of the neural network adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis are subsets of neuro fuzzy algorithms jang 1993 in total the structure of anfis consists of five layers the input nodes are entered in the first layer also the membership function is assigned to the input nodes considering an anfis model with two inputs the output of the first layer o i 1 is calculated as follows 8 o i 1 μ a i x f o r i 1 2 o i 1 μ b i y f o r i 3 4 where μ a i and μ b i are membership functions and x represents the input at node i modeling operations are performed in the second to the fourth layers the weight of each rule wi is determined in the second layer as follows 9 o i 2 w i μ a i x μ b i y i 1 2 where o i 2 is the output of the second layer in the third layer the relative weight of the law is calculated as 10 o i 3 w i w i i w i i 1 2 where o i 3 is the output of the third layer the fourth layer is known as the rule layer and the output of this layer o i 4 is defined as 11 o i 4 w i f i i 1 2 where fi is the function obtained from fuzzy rules the fifth layer represents the network output o i 5 as follows zounemat kermani and teshnehlab 2008 12 o i 5 i w i f i w i f i w i f i i 1 2 2 5 hybrid methods and meta heuristic algorithms in addition to using the standard versions of the mlpnn and anfis models in this study four optimization algorithms are used to optimize the parameters of both methods in the mlpnn method weights and biases of the designed network with the same conditions as the classical one are optimized using optimization algorithms in the anfis method the number of membership functions as well as membership parameters are optimized in the following the algorithms used include particle swarm optimization pso genetic algorithm ga firefly algorithm fa and moth flame optimization mfo will be briefly described 2 5 1 genetic algorithm the genetic algorithm used in computer optimization issues is based on genetic performance in nature in ga a population of individuals or chromosomes represents candidate solution this algorithm uses a mechanism inspired by biological evolution operators such as selection mutation and crossover are utilized selection procedure enables better generations to pass into the next population mutation increases the diversity of the genetic material to avoid premature convergence to local solutions crossover operation combines two parents to produce two new offspring that inherit good traits from their parents given the fitness of the target function of each individual the chance of survival and reproduction increases more detailed information about the ga can be found in holland 1992 horton et al 2018 2 5 2 particle swarm optimization algorithm the pso algorithm is one of the population based algorithms inspired by the movement and behavior of birds flock or fish school swarms in this algorithm the position of each particle is a potential solution to the problem hein et al 2017 using the objective function the suitability of each particle is determined based on its position in the pso each particle is defined with a velocity vector and a position vector the velocity vector is updated based on the personal experience of the particle and its characteristics of its neighbours afterwards the new position of the particle is calculated using the velocity vector the location of each particle is influenced by two factors the first factor is the best position ever achieved by each particle pbest and the second is the best condition where the other particles are located in the vicinity of the particle the second factor is the global best value in the swarm gbest obtained by any potential particle in the population at each iteration the velocity and the particle position are updated as follows 13 v i it 1 ω v i it β 1 c 1 pbes t i x i it β 2 c 2 gbes t i x i it 14 x i it 1 x i it v i it 1 where v i it 1 and v i it are the velocities in iteration it 1 and it ω is the initial inertia weight which is used to control the impact of the previous velocity β1 and β1 are the learning factors c1 and c2 are the random function in the range 0 1 and x i it 1 and x i it are the positions of i particle in it 1 and it iteration readers are referred to the references kennedy and eberhart 1995 hein et al 2017 for more details 2 5 3 firefly algorithm the firefly optimization fa algorithm was proposed by yang 2009 and yang and he 2013 this algorithm is inspired by the social behavior of fireflies and each firefly is considered as a candidate solution to the problem fireflies produce light for absorbing mates bates and also protecting themselves in the fa algorithm it is assumed that all the flies are attracted to the luminous fireflies the greater the brightness of a firefly the more attractive it will be the amount of brightness also decreases with increasing distance attractiveness i is calculated as follows 15 i i 0 e γ d 2 where d is the distance between two agent i0 is the original light intensity and γ is the light absorption coefficient when γ 0 the fa algorithm changes to a variant of the pso yang and he 2014 the new position of the firefly i that is attracted to the brighter one firefly j is determined as follows 16 x i it 1 x i it i 0 e γ d ij 2 x j it x i it ρ ε i it where x i it 1 and x i it are the new and old positions of the ith firefly ρ is the randomization parameter in the range 0 1 and ε i it is a vector of random numbers drawn from a gaussian distribution yang and he 2014 between two fireflies each firefly will be attracted to the brighter one and if none of them is brighter the movement will be random for more information about this algorithm refer to yang 2009 yang and he 2013 sánchez et al 2017 2 5 4 moth flame optimization algorithm the moth flame optimization mfo has been presented recently and is known as one of the novel meta heuristic optimization techniques mirjalili 2015 the mfo algorithm imitates the movement process of moths at night the optimization is based on the moving mechanism of each moth towards the light source on a straight line when the light source is far e g the moon and in a spiral motion when the source is closer e g a torch as each moth is considered as a possible candidate for the best solution the moth s position is introduced as the problem parameter in mfo moths and flames are both solutions but the way they are treated to be updated is different flames are considered as the best position of moths and moths are agents with the responsibility of search in the specified search space search process around flame helps moths not to move far from the best solution the position of moths would be updated in each iteration as follows 17 m i s m i f j 18 s m i f j d i e ct cos 2 π t f j where mi and fj are the i th moth and j th flame respectively s is the spiral function di is the distance between the i th moth and the j th flame c is a constant and t is a random number in the range 1 1 detailed description of the mfo optimization algorithm are provided mirjalili 2015 2 6 experimental data and model setup 2 6 1 datasets since considering more datasets and gathering them from diverse reports and sources would challenge the ai ddms and make the evaluation more reliable a total of six related data sources with the available experimental data were explored and the pertinent data were extracted machiels et al 2009 reported the results of some experiments conducted on a large scale pkw model in a channel with 7 2 m long 1 2 m wide and 1 2 m high these experiments performed in the laboratory of structures hydraulics at the university of liège belgium singhal 2009 published the results of some experiments related to the flow passing pkw in a flume with 50 cm wide and more than 5 m long in the laboratory of the institute of technology roorkee india reis 2015 used the facility assembled at the national laboratory of civil engineering in portugal to study the hydraulics of stepped spillways downstream of a pkw the experiments performed in a flume with 1 m wide and more than 6 m long anderson 2011 experiments were conducted in acrylic flume with 7 31 m long 0 93 m wide and 0 61 m deep in utah water research laboratory the usa safarzadeh and khayyatrostami 2016 carried out experiments in a glass flume with 10 m long 1 m wide and 0 8 m deep in iran afzalian and ahadiyan 2016 experiments were performed in shahid chamran university laboratory iran in a flume with 10 m long 0 8 m wide and 0 6 deep in this regard a total of 430 datasets from different reports and sources were collected for modeling the flow over pkws see table 1 independent parameters for the passing flow modeling over pkw qpkw include sum of height pkws and flow approach depth p pm total transverse width w outlet key width wo inlet key width wi inlet key overhang length bi outlet key overhang length bo crest length l pkw s base length bm and the total head h these parameters are shown in figs 1 and 2 table 1 also shows the geometric characteristics of overflows and the hydraulic performance of the experiments that have been used in this study 2 6 2 evaluation criteria in machine learning approaches it is recommended to split the dataset into three parts including the training validation and testing sets hereupon in this study the datasets were randomly divided into the three categories of training 70 validation 15 and testing 15 sets the training phase is utilized for training the ai ddms the modelling evaluation is based on the testing phase and the validation dataset is used to prevent further training over fitting of the ai ddms to compare and evaluate the performance of different ai ddms and empirical relations various statistics including root mean square errors rmse nash sutcliffe nse determination coefficient r2 mean absolute error mae and the index of agreement ia were used the above mentioned statics can be expressed as 19 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i m y i o 2 20 mae 1 n i 1 n y i m y i o 21 r 2 i 1 n y i m y m y i o y o 2 i 1 n y i m y m 2 i 1 n y i o y o 2 22 nse 1 i 1 n y i m y i o 2 i 1 n y i o y o 2 23 ia i 1 n y i m y i o 2 i 1 n y i m y o y i o y o 2 where y i m is the model s output y i o is the observed value target n is the number of data and bar denotes the average of the variable an efficiency of 0 for the rmse and mae unity for the nse r2 and ia correspond to a perfect match of the modelled to the observed data 2 6 3 general features of the ai ddms the initial parameters of all the meta heuristic optimization algorithms are summarized in table 2 further the maximum number of iterations and the computational cost for each ai ddm are tabulated in table 3 3 models implementation and results in this research three experimental methods as well as ten ai ddms are used to simulate the pkw overflow the statistical evaluation results of the various methods for the training and validation stages of ai ddm methods are shown in table 4 the results in table 4 imply that all the ai ddm models have the ability to model the flow passing pkw the average determination coefficient at the training stage for all ai ddms is 0 967 the average nse is equivalent to 0 964 and the average ia is 0 991 among the ddm models the mlpnn lm the classical anfis model anfis gd and all the hybrid anfis models except for the anfis mfo have the best fit with the experimental results at the training and validation stages the results presented in table 4 also indicate that the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm in the mlpnn lm combination rmse of the training stage 1 304 ltr s and of the validation stage 4 617 ltr s acted better than the other optimization methods in the training and validation sets regarding the obtained results for the anfis models it is evident that the pso algorithm improved the performance of the standard anfis cgd both for the training and validation stages evaluation of the results of each model is far more important at the testing stage which determines the final performance analysis of each method the results of the testing stage for all the ddms as well as the three empirical relations are presented in table 5 according to the results in table 5 all the ai ddms performed far better than the empirical relations for estimating the qkpw however considering the rmse as the basis for comparison the use of the mfo algorithm to train the mlpnn and anfis methods not only improve the results but also increased the error rate of 260 47 and 178 60 respectively in comparison to the classic mlpnn and anfis models mlpnn lm anfis cgd the average rmse for ddms is about 9 466 ltr s far lower than the empirical relations averaged rmse 40 416 ltr s the use of all the meta heuristic optimization algorithms in training ai ddms except for the mfo algorithm has increased the accuracy of the models among the meta heuristic algorithms used for anfis the pso algorithm has the best results with the lowest rmse rmse 1 474 ltr s and the highest ia ia 0 9999 among the suggested empirical relations the relationship provided by machiels 2012 with rmse 36 734 ltr s is more accurate than the other two suggested relations having a better insight about the performance of the different ai ddms and the best empirical relation machiels 2012 the results of the testing stage of each model is illustrated in the form of scatter plots in fig 3 visual analysis of the scatter plots in fig 3 shows that the ai ddms perform better than empirical relations the distributed points associated with the ai ddms are closer to the line of agreement in comparison to the empirical relation in order to have a diagnostic analysis in addition to the scatter plots the taylor diagram is implemented for investigating the standard deviation and correlation coefficient values between the observed and simulated qpkw for all the applied ddms and empirical relations fig 4 in fig 4 the distance from the reference point origin represents the quantity of the centred rmse taylor 2001 hence the superior model could be distinguished next to the origin with a correlation coefficient equals unity and the same amplitude of variations compared with the observed data it is clear from fig 4 that presents the best simulation of qpkw among all the applied models the taylor diagram shows that the outputs of ai ddms except for the mfo meta heuristic algorithm are accumulated close to the observed values reference point the symbols of the utilized three empirical relations used in this study are more scattered from the reference point the observation symbol in fig 4 in comparison to the ai ddms which confirms the higher accuracy of the ai ddm models used in this research 4 discussion in this research ten data driven methods as well as 3 empirical relations have been used to simulate the flow of passing the pkw the results presented in the previous section imply the superiority of anfis models to the mlpnn in addition all the ai ddms performed better than the empirical relations to find out if there is a significant difference between the methods used statistically simulated outcomes of each model were tested against the measured values using the mann whitney test for two confidence levels of 95 and 99 table 6 the results in table 6 show that there is no significant difference between the output of all the ai ddms and observational values at 99 and 95 confidence levels also based on the p value amount the results of two of the proposed empirical relations kabiri samani and javaheri 2012 and leite ribeiro et al 2007 have a significant difference with the measured values at the 95 confidence interval and therefore these methods are not suggested to be used for simulating qpkw on the other hand regardless of the optimization algorithm one can refer to anfis mlpnn and machiels 2012 for qpkw simulation it is worth mentioning that the dimensional datasets used in this study for constructing the ann and anfis models see table 1 have been established on the knowledge attained from the general formulae represented by researchers see eqs 3 6 an alternative option is to consider the dimensional analysis and transform dimensional parameters to dimensionless numbers keijzer and babovic 2002 according to babovic 2009 by using this approach potential problems related to units of measurement can be avoided eventually in order to have a better insight and having an overall judgment for the capability of the data driven models in simulating the hydraulic behaviour of weirs the final outcomes of the similar studies to the topic of this paper have been considered and the general and brief remarks are presented in table 7 table 7 summarizes the application of ai ddms for simulating flow passing weirs spillways the findings of similar studies confirm the capability of ai ddms in simulating predicting flow behavior through the weirs spillways of dams and hydraulic structures moreover it can be observed that the only analogous reported study for the usage of ai ddms on the pkws is the research paper by olyaie et al 2018 5 conclusions in this research artificial intelligence data driven models anfis mlpnn embedded with several meta heuristic algorithms ga pso fa mfo were used to simulate the passing flow over piano key weirs qpkw to compare the performance of these models three empirical relations that have been proposed by other researchers were also considered for this purpose general results indicated that the anfiss and mlpnns can simulate the qpkw more accurately than empirical relations among all the ai ddms it was found that the hybrid anfis model with the pso optimization algorithm anfis pso had the best performance rmse 1 4737 ltr s r2 0 9998 the ga pso and fa algorithms improved the performance of the classical anifs and mlpnn based on different statistical criteria rmse r2 ai mae nse but according to the results of this study the same claim cannot be concluded for the mfo algorithm in which did not improve the performance of the standard versions of anfis and mlpnn models according to the mann whitney test to compare differences between two independent datasets it was concluded that there is not any statistically significant difference between all the applied models at 99 confidence interval however considering the 95 confidence interval two of the proposed empirical relations are not suggested to be considered for simulating the qpkw

the reservoirs the escalation in probable maximum storm amplitudes and the need for dam safety some of the existing spillways weirs are seemed to be undersized and need to be replaced kabiri samani and javaheri 2012 anderson 2011 generally there are three remedies to increase the discharge efficiency considering the discharge coefficient of the standard weir equation of a spillway weir limited by a maximum elevation of the free surface water a increasing the width of the spillway weir b lowering the elevation of the weir crest and or 3 substituting the linear weir with a nonlinear weir such as piano key weir pkw type in order to increase the length in the weir footprint anderson 2011 leite ribeiro et all 2012a increasing the length of a linear weir spillway introduced as the first remedy is often impractical because of dam geometry and economic issues moreover lowering the elevation of the dam crest introduced as the second remedy would decrease the normal elevation of the pool reservoir which results in the reduction of the amount of water storage available however the third remedy which is the usage of non linear weirs such as pkw seems to be the only proper and accepted approach anderson and tullis 2012a b 2013 if a dam or any other hydraulic structure cannot adequately pass the updated flood the structure requires modification by increasing the flood storage space and or increasing the spillway capacity therefore one of the innovative and effective ways to increase weir capacity is to use a nonlinear weir such as labyrinth weirs or pkws a labyrinth weir fig 1 is known as a non linear weir which is oriented in zigzag form would increase the length of the weir in comparison to a linear sharp crested weir according to the scientific reports the increase in the length of a labyrinth weir can increase the efficiency of the discharge by 3 4 times compared to a linear weir tullis et al 1995 piano key weirs are developed as alternatives to the labyrinthine weirs and have been designed explicitly for the application of control structure footprint chi hien et al 2006a b lemperiere and ouamane 2003 likewise the labyrinth weirs it is claimed that pkws can increase the flow discharge capacity by up to four times compared to a traditional sharp crested weir lemperiere and ouamane 2003 fig 1 depicts the two main differences between the traditional trapezoidal labyrinth weirs and pkws which are 1 pkws have a rectangular crest layout a plan view like a labyrinth weir with θ 0 and 2 pkws have sloped ramped inlet and outlet key floors 1 2 literature review the literature review of the associated topics of this study can be divided into two main categories of 1 experimental studies for pkws flow simulation and 2 the application of artificial intelligence data driven models ai ddms in modelling flow behaviour or geometric characteristics of weirs including the pkws considering studies associated with the experimental modelling of pkws several researchers have investigated the effect of geometric parameters on the discharge capacity of pkws chi hien et al 2006a b ouamane and lempérière 2006 machiels et al 2011a b anderson 2011 pralong et al 2011 leite ribeiro et al 2012a b kabiri samani and javaheri 2012 machiels et al 2013 mehboudi et al 2016 al shukur and al khafaji 2018 khassaf and al baghdadi 2018 lempérière and jun 2005 and hien et al 2006 suggested that an optimal design for a pkw is reached whenever the wi wo 1 2 where wi and wo are the inlet and outlet key width see fig 1 hien et al 2006 found that pkw geometry is generally more efficient than labyrinth weir for nappe aeration due to its overhanging geometry in accordance with the main topic of this paper the following recent studies on using ai ddms for simulating hydraulic phenomena can be mentioned baptist et al 2007 applied the genetic programming gp to the results of a numerical model in order to obtain an expression for roughness based on synthetic data for the description of vegetation induced roughness harris et al 2014 conducted laboratory experiments and recorded observed flow data in compound channels with vegetated floodplains and used gp for predicting compound channels velocity zounemat kermani et al 2018 simulated the incipient motion velocity of bed sediments using various ai ddms and claimed these methods are more accurate than empirical relations giustolisi 2004 used gp to determine chezy resistance coefficient for full circular corrugated channels and showed that the gp supplies equations more efficient than the monomial equations dursun et al 2012 estimated the discharge coefficient of semi elliptical labyrinth side weir using the anfis model the performance of the anfis model was compared with the multiple linear regression and nonlinear regression models comparison results indicated that the anfis model can be successfully utilized in modelling the discharge coefficient zaji et al 2016 applied the hybrid support vector regression model and firefly optimization algorithm svr fa to predict the discharge coefficient of labyrinth side weirs the results indicated that the svr fa model is about 10 more accurate than the svr model according to the rmse criterion haghbi et al 2017 predicted the discharge coefficient of triangular labyrinth weirs using artificial neural network ann and anfis models comparing the results of the ann with anfis model indicated that both models have acceptable performance however the structure of anfis model is optimal olyaie et al 2018 used several ai ddms ann gene expression programming extreme learning machine and least square support vector machine for estimating the discharge coefficient of pkws comparison of the results showed that the extreme learning machine and lssvm models were able to produce better results than the other ai ddms and could be employed successfully in modelling discharge coefficient from the available experimental data 1 3 objectives and contribution of the study according to the literature review several researchers applied and evaluated ai ddms in modelling the geometric characteristics and hydraulic behavior of weirs spillways in this study the discharge capacity of pkws type a is estimated by using ten standard and hybrid ai ddms including multi layer perceptron neural network with the levenberg marquardt algorithm 1 mlpnn lm hybrid mlpnn with four meta heuristic optimization methods including the genetic algorithm 2 mlpnn ga particle swarm optimization 3 mlpnn pso firefly algorithm 4 mlpnn fa and moth flame optimization 5 mlpnn mfo in addition to the neural network models the standard adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system with the conjugate gradient descent algorithm 6 anfis cgd as well as four hybrid anfis models 7 anfis ga 8 anfis pso 9 anfis fa and 10 anfis mfo are also applied to the modelling process in accordance with the above mentioned description the major contributions of this study can be described as 1 as a matter of fact several studies have been accomplished using ai methods for modelling flow over the spillways and outlet works however the application of ai ddms for exploring the hydraulic behavior of the passing flow over the pkws are rare see table 7 hence the results of this study would help to reach a better conclusion about the precision of ai ddms in modelling the phenomenon 2 this study considers a variety of meta heuristic optimization algorithms for challenging the mlpnn and anfis models in modelling the flow capacity over spillways and weirs henceforth the outcomes of this study will not only be restricted to the analysis of the hydraulic aspects of the modelling procedure but also the assessment of the efficiency of hybrid ai ddms for both the accuracy and computational costs perspective 2 materials and methods 2 1 general hydraulic issues of pkws and the presented empirical relations in this section a brief overview of the characteristics of the passing flow over pkws is given together with the existing knowledge about the hydraulics of the domain and constructing the ann and anfis models to compute the discharge

cycle width 2 2 data driven models in this section a brief review on the applied ai ddms including the mlpnn and anfis models is presented complete description and information about these models can be found in many related reports such as remesan and mathew 2016 esen and inalli 2010 bilgehan 2011 2 3 mlp neural network artificial neural networks ann are soft computing methods which provide a flexible computational framework for a wide range of nonlinear problems one of the obvious advantages of these models to mathematical non linear models is that the anns are global approximator that can approximate any type of function with desired precision typically multi layer perceptron neural networks mlpnn include a set of processor units neurons that consist of an input layer one or more hidden layers and an output layer in these types of neural networks the input signals propagate through the network and in the forward direction in a layer to layer procedure zounemat kermani et al 2013 in mlpnns with one hidden layer similar to the used one in this study the predicted value y net is calculated as follows 7 y net b 0 j 1 m w j φ b 0 j i 1 k w ji x i where b0 is the bias w represents the weights m is the number of hidden nodes xi is the input variables k is the number of inputs and φ is the transfer function piotrowski et al 2015 in this study hyperbolic tangent sigmoid and log sigmoid activation functions are used in the hidden and output layers respectively 2 4 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system neuro fuzzy hybrid systems have the advantages of fuzzy systems and neural networks neuro fuzzy modeling describes the behavior of a system with fuzzy logic rules within the structure of the neural network adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis are subsets of neuro fuzzy algorithms jang 1993 in total the structure of anfis consists of five layers the input nodes are entered in the first layer also the membership function is assigned to the input nodes considering an anfis model with two inputs the output of the first layer o i 1 is calculated as follows 8 o i 1 μ a i x f o r i 1 2 o i 1 μ b i y f o r i 3 4 where μ a i and μ b i are membership functions and x represents the input at node i modeling operations are performed in the second to the fourth layers the weight of each rule wi is determined in the second layer as follows 9 o i 2 w i μ a i x μ b i y i 1 2 where o i 2 is the output of the second layer in the third layer the relative weight of the law is calculated as 10 o i 3 w i w i i w i i 1 2 where o i 3 is the output of the third layer the fourth layer is known as the rule layer and the output of this layer o i 4 is defined as 11 o i 4 w i f i i 1 2 where fi is the function obtained from fuzzy rules the fifth layer represents the network output o i 5 as follows zounemat kermani and teshnehlab 2008 12 o i 5 i w i f i w i f i w i f i i 1 2 2 5 hybrid methods and meta heuristic algorithms in addition to using the standard versions of the mlpnn and anfis models in this study four optimization algorithms are used to optimize the parameters of both methods in the mlpnn method weights and biases of the designed network with the same conditions as the classical one are optimized using optimization algorithms in the anfis method the number of membership functions as well as membership parameters are optimized in the following the algorithms used include particle swarm optimization pso genetic algorithm ga firefly algorithm fa and moth flame optimization mfo will be briefly described 2 5 1 genetic algorithm the genetic algorithm used in computer optimization issues is based on genetic performance in nature in ga a population of individuals or chromosomes represents candidate solution this algorithm uses a mechanism inspired by biological evolution operators such as selection mutation and crossover are utilized selection procedure enables better generations to pass into the next population mutation increases the diversity of the genetic material to avoid premature convergence to local solutions crossover operation combines two parents to produce two new offspring that inherit good traits from their parents given the fitness of the target function of each individual the chance of survival and reproduction increases more detailed information about the ga can be found in holland 1992 horton et al 2018 2 5 2 particle swarm optimization algorithm the pso algorithm is one of the population based algorithms inspired by the movement and behavior of birds flock or fish school swarms in this algorithm the position of each particle is a potential solution to the problem hein et al 2017 using the objective function the suitability of each particle is determined based on its position in the pso each particle is defined with a velocity vector and a position vector the velocity vector is updated based on the personal experience of the particle and its characteristics of its neighbours afterwards the new position of the particle is calculated using the velocity vector the location of each particle is influenced by two factors the first factor is the best position ever achieved by each particle pbest and the second is the best condition where the other particles are located in the vicinity of the particle the second factor is the global best value in the swarm gbest obtained by any potential particle in the population at each iteration the velocity and the particle position are updated as follows 13 v i it 1 ω v i it β 1 c 1 pbes t i x i it β 2 c 2 gbes t i x i it 14 x i it 1 x i it v i it 1 where v i it 1 and v i it are the velocities in iteration it 1 and it ω is the initial inertia weight which is used to control the impact of the previous velocity β1 and β1 are the learning factors c1 and c2 are the random function in the range 0 1 and x i it 1 and x i it are the positions of i particle in it 1 and it iteration readers are referred to the references kennedy and eberhart 1995 hein et al 2017 for more details 2 5 3 firefly algorithm the firefly optimization fa algorithm was proposed by yang 2009 and yang and he 2013 this algorithm is inspired by the social behavior of fireflies and each firefly is considered as a candidate solution to the problem fireflies produce light for absorbing mates bates and also protecting themselves in the fa algorithm it is assumed that all the flies are attracted to the luminous fireflies the greater the brightness of a firefly the more attractive it will be the amount of brightness also decreases with increasing distance attractiveness i is calculated as follows 15 i i 0 e γ d 2 where d is the distance between two agent i0 is the original light intensity and γ is the light absorption coefficient when γ 0 the fa algorithm changes to a variant of the pso yang and he 2014 the new position of the firefly i that is attracted to the brighter one firefly j is determined as follows 16 x i it 1 x i it i 0 e γ d ij 2 x j it x i it ρ ε i it where x i it 1 and x i it are the new and old positions of the ith firefly ρ is the randomization parameter in the range 0 1 and ε i it is a vector of random numbers drawn from a gaussian distribution yang and he 2014 between two fireflies each firefly will be attracted to the brighter one and if none of them is brighter the movement will be random for more information about this algorithm refer to yang 2009 yang and he 2013 sánchez et al 2017 2 5 4 moth flame optimization algorithm the moth flame optimization mfo has been presented recently and is known as one of the novel meta heuristic optimization techniques mirjalili 2015 the mfo algorithm imitates the movement process of moths at night the optimization is based on the moving mechanism of each moth towards the light source on a straight line when the light source is far e g the moon and in a spiral motion when the source is closer e g a torch as each moth is considered as a possible candidate for the best solution the moth s position is introduced as the problem parameter in mfo moths and flames are both solutions but the way they are treated to be updated is different flames are considered as the best position of moths and moths are agents with the responsibility of search in the specified search space search process around flame helps moths not to move far from the best solution the position of moths would be updated in each iteration as follows 17 m i s m i f j 18 s m i f j d i e ct cos 2 π t f j where mi and fj are the i th moth and j th flame respectively s is the spiral function di is the distance between the i th moth and the j th flame c is a constant and t is a random number in the range 1 1 detailed description of the mfo optimization algorithm are provided mirjalili 2015 2 6 experimental data and model setup 2 6 1 datasets since considering more datasets and gathering them from diverse reports and sources would challenge the ai ddms and make the evaluation more reliable a total of six related data sources with the available experimental data were explored and the pertinent data were extracted machiels et al 2009 reported the results of some experiments conducted on a large scale pkw model in a channel with 7 2 m long 1 2 m wide and 1 2 m high these experiments performed in the laboratory of structures hydraulics at the university of liège belgium singhal 2009 published the results of some experiments related to the flow passing pkw in a flume with 50 cm wide and more than 5 m long in the laboratory of the institute of technology roorkee india reis 2015 used the facility assembled at the national laboratory of civil engineering in portugal to study the hydraulics of stepped spillways downstream of a pkw the experiments performed in a flume with 1 m wide and more than 6 m long anderson 2011 experiments were conducted in acrylic flume with 7 31 m long 0 93 m wide and 0 61 m deep in utah water research laboratory the usa safarzadeh and khayyatrostami 2016 carried out experiments in a glass flume with 10 m long 1 m wide and 0 8 m deep in iran afzalian and ahadiyan 2016 experiments were performed in shahid chamran university laboratory iran in a flume with 10 m long 0 8 m wide and 0 6 deep in this regard a total of 430 datasets from different reports and sources were collected for modeling the flow over pkws see table 1 independent parameters for the passing flow modeling over pkw qpkw include sum of height pkws and flow approach depth p pm total transverse width w outlet key width wo inlet key width wi inlet key overhang length bi outlet key overhang length bo crest length l pkw s base length bm and the total head h these parameters are shown in figs 1 and 2 table 1 also shows the geometric characteristics of overflows and the hydraulic performance of the experiments that have been used in this study 2 6 2 evaluation criteria in machine learning approaches it is recommended to split the dataset into three parts including the training validation and testing sets hereupon in this study the datasets were randomly divided into the three categories of training 70 validation 15 and testing 15 sets the training phase is utilized for training the ai ddms the modelling evaluation is based on the testing phase and the validation dataset is used to prevent further training over fitting of the ai ddms to compare and evaluate the performance of different ai ddms and empirical relations various statistics including root mean square errors rmse nash sutcliffe nse determination coefficient r2 mean absolute error mae and the index of agreement ia were used the above mentioned statics can be expressed as 19 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i m y i o 2 20 mae 1 n i 1 n y i m y i o 21 r 2 i 1 n y i m y m y i o y o 2 i 1 n y i m y m 2 i 1 n y i o y o 2 22 nse 1 i 1 n y i m y i o 2 i 1 n y i o y o 2 23 ia i 1 n y i m y i o 2 i 1 n y i m y o y i o y o 2 where y i m is the model s output y i o is the observed value target n is the number of data and bar denotes the average of the variable an efficiency of 0 for the rmse and mae unity for the nse r2 and ia correspond to a perfect match of the modelled to the observed data 2 6 3 general features of the ai ddms the initial parameters of all the meta heuristic optimization algorithms are summarized in table 2 further the maximum number of iterations and the computational cost for each ai ddm are tabulated in table 3 3 models implementation and results in this research three experimental methods as well as ten ai ddms are used to simulate the pkw overflow the statistical evaluation results of the various methods for the training and validation stages of ai ddm methods are shown in table 4 the results in table 4 imply that all the ai ddm models have the ability to model the flow passing pkw the average determination coefficient at the training stage for all ai ddms is 0 967 the average nse is equivalent to 0 964 and the average ia is 0 991 among the ddm models the mlpnn lm the classical anfis model anfis gd and all the hybrid anfis models except for the anfis mfo have the best fit with the experimental results at the training and validation stages the results presented in table 4 also indicate that the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm in the mlpnn lm combination rmse of the training stage 1 304 ltr s and of the validation stage 4 617 ltr s acted better than the other optimization methods in the training and validation sets regarding the obtained results for the anfis models it is evident that the pso algorithm improved the performance of the standard anfis cgd both for the training and validation stages evaluation of the results of each model is far more important at the testing stage which determines the final performance analysis of each method the results of the testing stage for all the ddms as well as the three empirical relations are presented in table 5 according to the results in table 5 all the ai ddms performed far better than the empirical relations for estimating the qkpw however considering the rmse as the basis for comparison the use of the mfo algorithm to train the mlpnn and anfis methods not only improve the results but also increased the error rate of 260 47 and 178 60 respectively in comparison to the classic mlpnn and anfis models mlpnn lm anfis cgd the average rmse for ddms is about 9 466 ltr s far lower than the empirical relations averaged rmse 40 416 ltr s the use of all the meta heuristic optimization algorithms in training ai ddms except for the mfo algorithm has increased the accuracy of the models among the meta heuristic algorithms used for anfis the pso algorithm has the best results with the lowest rmse rmse 1 474 ltr s and the highest ia ia 0 9999 among the suggested empirical relations the relationship provided by machiels 2012 with rmse 36 734 ltr s is more accurate than the other two suggested relations having a better insight about the performance of the different ai ddms and the best empirical relation machiels 2012 the results of the testing stage of each model is illustrated in the form of scatter plots in fig 3 visual analysis of the scatter plots in fig 3 shows that the ai ddms perform better than empirical relations the distributed points associated with the ai ddms are closer to the line of agreement in comparison to the empirical relation in order to have a diagnostic analysis in addition to the scatter plots the taylor diagram is implemented for investigating the standard deviation and correlation coefficient values between the observed and simulated qpkw for all the applied ddms and empirical relations fig 4 in fig 4 the distance from the reference point origin represents the quantity of the centred rmse taylor 2001 hence the superior model could be distinguished next to the origin with a correlation coefficient equals unity and the same amplitude of variations compared with the observed data it is clear from fig 4 that presents the best simulation of qpkw among all the applied models the taylor diagram shows that the outputs of ai ddms except for the mfo meta heuristic algorithm are accumulated close to the observed values reference point the symbols of the utilized three empirical relations used in this study are more scattered from the reference point the observation symbol in fig 4 in comparison to the ai ddms which confirms the higher accuracy of the ai ddm models used in this research 4 discussion in this research ten data driven methods as well as 3 empirical relations have been used to simulate the flow of passing the pkw the results presented in the previous section imply the superiority of anfis models to the mlpnn in addition all the ai ddms performed better than the empirical relations to find out if there is a significant difference between the methods used statistically simulated outcomes of each model were tested against the measured values using the mann whitney test for two confidence levels of 95 and 99 table 6 the results in table 6 show that there is no significant difference between the output of all the ai ddms and observational values at 99 and 95 confidence levels also based on the p value amount the results of two of the proposed empirical relations kabiri samani and javaheri 2012 and leite ribeiro et al 2007 have a significant difference with the measured values at the 95 confidence interval and therefore these methods are not suggested to be used for simulating qpkw on the other hand regardless of the optimization algorithm one can refer to anfis mlpnn and machiels 2012 for qpkw simulation it is worth mentioning that the dimensional datasets used in this study for constructing the ann and anfis models see table 1 have been established on the knowledge attained from the general formulae represented by researchers see eqs 3 6 an alternative option is to consider the dimensional analysis and transform dimensional parameters to dimensionless numbers keijzer and babovic 2002 according to babovic 2009 by using this approach potential problems related to units of measurement can be avoided eventually in order to have a better insight and having an overall judgment for the capability of the data driven models in simulating the hydraulic behaviour of weirs the final outcomes of the similar studies to the topic of this paper have been considered and the general and brief remarks are presented in table 7 table 7 summarizes the application of ai ddms for simulating flow passing weirs spillways the findings of similar studies confirm the capability of ai ddms in simulating predicting flow behavior through the weirs spillways of dams and hydraulic structures moreover it can be observed that the only analogous reported study for the usage of ai ddms on the pkws is the research paper by olyaie et al 2018 5 conclusions in this research artificial intelligence data driven models anfis mlpnn embedded with several meta heuristic algorithms ga pso fa mfo were used to simulate the passing flow over piano key weirs qpkw to compare the performance of these models three empirical relations that have been proposed by other researchers were also considered for this purpose general results indicated that the anfiss and mlpnns can simulate the qpkw more accurately than empirical relations among all the ai ddms it was found that the hybrid anfis model with the pso optimization algorithm anfis pso had the best performance rmse 1 4737 ltr s r2 0 9998 the ga pso and fa algorithms improved the performance of the classical anifs and mlpnn based on different statistical criteria rmse r2 ai mae nse but according to the results of this study the same claim cannot be concluded for the mfo algorithm in which did not improve the performance of the standard versions of anfis and mlpnn models according to the mann whitney test to compare differences between two independent datasets it was concluded that there is not any statistically significant difference between all the applied models at 99 confidence interval however considering the 95 confidence interval two of the proposed empirical relations are not suggested to be considered for simulating the qpkw 
6746,high frequency water quality monitoring is increasingly used in examining the nutrient fluxes within catchments despite this no studies have assessed the impact of monitoring frequency on the uncertainty of nitrate estimates obtained from distributed or semi distributed catchment models this study aims to evaluate the impacts of two different frequencies of nitrate sampling on the performance of a catchment hydrology model including the uncertainty in both predictions and calibrated parameters the investigation uses the hype model to simulate streamflow and nitrate concentrations 2010 2015 in the selke catchment a heterogeneous mesoscale catchment in central germany the bayesian inference scheme of the dream code was employed for calibration and uncertainty analysis and to explore differences between fortnightly and daily nitrate sampling strategies the results indicate that a the posterior uncertainty intervals of nitrogen export process parameters were narrower when the model was calibrated to daily nitrate measurements while similar maximum likelihood parameter values were obtained regardless of the sampling frequency b the model calibrated using daily nitrate data better represented both daily and fortnightly nitrate measurements relative to that obtained using fortnightly sampling c the daily nitrate dataset produced significantly smaller parametric prediction uncertainty but only modest reduction in total prediction uncertainty relative to the fortnightly nitrate dataset d model structural error and measurement errors are the primary sources of total prediction uncertainty and these combine to inhibit the benefits of high frequency monitoring we conclude that the adequacy of sampling frequency is dependent on model structure and measurement errors such that higher frequency nitrate monitoring may not markedly reduce the uncertainty of nutrient predictions depending on other levels and sources of uncertainty keywords nitrate

concentrations in streams jiang et al 2015 compared nutrient runoff models based on single site or multi site stream gauging stations for the selke river referred to locally as simply selke catchment germany they found that multi site calibration improved the performance of their nitrate model indicated by an increase of 12 in the nash sutcliffe coefficient for calibration mismatch and a decrease

when higher frequency sampling is available based on statistical uncertainty analysis and using long term nitrate measurements levine et al 2014 demonstrated that uncertainty in the detection of changes in stream nitrate concentrations over time increased when the sampling frequency was reduced from weekly to bimonthly previous catchment modelling investigations have adopted observations of stream nutrient concentrations at daily to monthly intervals in calibrating and validating nutrient export models e g ahmad et al 2011 jomaa et al 2016 lam et al 2012 lindström et al 2010 pathak et al 2018 shrestha et al 2007 woodward et al 2017 a limited number of nitrate export modelling studies have assessed different frequencies of nitrate monitoring adopted in calibration for example woodward et al 2017 showed that the simple lumped parameter daily time step catchment model streamgem predicted similar nitrate dynamics when calibrated using either monthly nitrate data or daily nitrate data several studies have similarly concluded that nitrate export modelling based on long term monthly nitrate datasets potentially represent reasonably well the seasonal dynamics of stream nitrate concentrations and loads jiang et al 2014 pathak et al 2018 woodward et al 2017 the general conclusion arising from these investigations is that monthly sampling may be sufficient to support water resource management decision making however other studies demonstrate that low frequency water quality sampling may restrict the calibration and validation of catchment nutrient export models chappell et al 2017 kirchner et al 2004 pathak et al 2018 although a proper investigation of model uncertainty has not been undertaken to support these claims previous evaluations of nutrient monitoring frequency are generally based on highly simplified models of catchment processes more generally daily nitrate data are rarely incorporated into semi distributed process based watershed modelling studies jomaa et al 2016 lam et al 2012 ahmad et al 2011 illustrated that calibration of their swat model using measurements at monthly intervals resulted in considerable underestimation of monthly sediment and nitrogen loads most notably during intensive rainfall periods under prediction of nitrate loads during storm flow conditions was also noted from a watershed nitrate transport model calibrated using daily nitrate data due to the underestimation of peak streamflow rates lam et al 2012 it appears from these studies that higher frequency monitoring has greater opportunity to avoid sampling related artefacts that arise when measurements are used in parameterizing process based watershed models used for water quality simulation jones et al 2014 to date the use of high frequency e g up to daily nutrient measurements in watershed water quality modelling is limited jones et al 2014 high frequency hydrochemical monitoring has mainly been used for a the direct observation and

et al 2016b sandford et al 2013 skarbøvik et al 2012 the benefits of adopting high frequency sampling strategies have been demonstrated for the direct calculation of nutrient and sediment loads for example skarbøvik et al 2012 reported that the reliability of average concentrations of suspended particulate matter improved with decreasing sampling interval i e from monthly to daily such that sampling at monthly intervals resulted in underestimation of sediment loads of up to 98 this arises because fortnightly to monthly sampling frequencies may miss significant nutrient and or sediment fluxes during storm events resulting in large errors in load estimation especially given that high flow conditions typically produce the highest nutrient and sediment transfer rates horowitz 2003 jordan and cassidy 2011 rodríguez blanco et al 2013 sharpley et al 2008 where nutrient and sediment fluxes are determined from catchment scale hydrological models uncertainty arises in the model predictions due to several factors ajami et al 2007 balin et al 2010 beven and binley 1992 these include measurement errors in model input data e g rainfall diffuse and point nutrient sources land use etc and calibration data e g flow rates nutrient concentrations etc uncertainty in model parameters that persists after model calibration i e posterior parameter uncertainty and model structural errors higher posterior parameter uncertainty is associated with parameters that are non uniquely estimated by model calibration and these tend to be weakly identifiable from the calibration dataset e g knowling and werner 2016 model structural errors include the averaging associated with the spatial and temporal resolution of calculations i e relative to field scale variability and the intrinsic inability of a given model to reproduce the physical and biogeochemical mechanisms involved in runoff generation and nutrient export e g ajami et al 2007 balin et al 2010 rode et al 2010 vrugt 2016 woodward et al 2017 yang et al 2007 we refer herein to the summation of model structural errors and measurement errors as residual errors the uncertainty that arises from these unavoidable limitations of hydrological models manifests as posterior parameter uncertainty and uncertainty in nutrient and flow predictions i e prediction uncertainty prediction uncertainty referred to hereafter as total prediction uncertainty has two components residual error and parametric prediction uncertainty the latter being the uncertainty in model simulation results that arises out of posterior parameter uncertainty the current study assesses both total prediction uncertainty and parametric prediction uncertainty thereby allowing us to infer residual error as the difference between the two posterior parameter uncertainty is also evaluated uncertainty analysis is a requisite component of catchment hydrology modelling activities because model parameters are often poorly constrained by field evidence and rely heavily on calibration and because parameter interdependence may lead to non unique predictions of future catchment behavior beven and binley 1992 wellen et al 2015 uncertainty analysis also allows for evaluation of the information content of different observations thereby guiding field measurement campaigns and strategies for model development arhonditsis et al 2007 rode et al 2010 additionally the provision of prediction uncertainty intervals allows for risk based decision making within watershed management arhonditsis et al 2007 uncertainty analysis is particularly important in the application of catchment hydrology models to estimate nutrient fluxes kyllmar et al 2014 some popular uncertainty analysis techniques used in catchment runoff and nutrient export

shuffled complex evolution metropolis algorithm dotto et al 2012 vrugt et al 2003 and dream differential evolution adaptive metropolis algorithm jiang et al 2015 laloy and vrugt 2012 the bayesian inference algorithm of dream has been widely used and proven to be appropriate to assess model uncertainty for a range of modelling applications it is able to constrain both total prediction

exploring posterior distributions of a large number of parameters in complex models for global minima in model error in attempting to optimize model parameters laloy and vrugt 2012 vrugt 2016 while uncertainty analysis is commonly conducted on rainfall runoff modelling to assess streamflow prediction uncertainty caused by various factors it is rarely implemented in nutrient export modelling

performance and uncertainty of four export coefficient models used to simulate nitrate export xia et al 2016 woodward et al 2017 illustrated that daily nitrate data used in calibration did not reduce the uncertainty of nitrate export predictions of the streamgem model compared to monthly nitrate data however they used a simple lumped process model that assumed constant nitrate concentrations discharged from near surface runoff fast groundwater and slow groundwater flow paths for nitrate export simulation to our knowledge no previous nitrate export studies that adopt process based semi distributed watershed models have attempted to assess the uncertainty of parameters and predictions related to various sampling frequencies e g fortnightly daily in nitrate measurements the objective of this study is to evaluate in a comprehensive manner the posterior parameter uncertainty calibration mismatch total prediction uncertainty parametric prediction uncertainty and residual error i e the sum of measurement error and model structural error associated with a watershed nitrate export model that arise from different frequencies daily fortnightly of in stream nitrate measurements a case study of the selke catchment is used as the basis for this evaluation dream version dreamzs laloy and vrugt 2012 was used to calibrate the hype model and assess the uncertainty of parameters and model outputs the current investigation assesses for the first time the effects of different frequencies fortnightly or daily of nitrate measurements in the simulation of nitrate export using a catchment scale distributed parameter model in doing so we expect that the findings will assist in designing other watershed models aimed at nutrient export estimation and in developing water quality monitoring programs i e establishing appropriate monitoring frequencies that aim to inform nitrate export models and water resource management more generally 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study site and data a heterogeneous nested mesoscale catchment selke catchment central germany was selected as the study area for testing different sampling frequencies the current study builds on previous investigations of the selke catchment by a subset of the current author list that is jiang et al 2014 evaluated the capability of the hype model to represent spatial and temporal variability in nitrogen fluxes while jiang et al 2015 assessed the impact of the spatial resolution in nitrogen observations on nitrogen export modelling again using the hype model the process based hype model was utilized again in the current investigation to simulate streamflow and stream water nitrate concentrations among the available codes the hype model requires readily available meteorological data rainfall temperature and offers apposite balance between representation of hydrological nutrient export processes and model complexity it has been applied successfully to the simulation of streamflow and water quality for catchments with a wide range of meteorological hydrological and physiographic characteristics but importantly this includes catchments that have features similar to the study area adopted for the current investigation e g jiang et al 2014 lindström et al 2010 yin et al 2016 selke is a tributary of the bode river which originates in the southwest of the state of saxony anhalt central germany in the vicinity of harz mountain selke drains an area of 463 km2 with elevations varying between 53 m and 605 m fig 1 the selke catchment is dominated by forest broad leaved coniferous and mixed forests in mountainous areas and by agriculture in lowland areas these accounting for 35 and 52 of the total catchment area respectively the remaining 13 of the catchment is used for pastures and urban land soil types are dominated by cambisols schist and claystone in the mountainous areas and chernozems tertiary sediments with loess in the lowland areas average precipitation decreases from 792 mm yr in the mountainous areas to 450 mm yr in the lowland areas with an average of 660 mm yr for the whole catchment annual precipitation is summer dominant with a ratio between summer and winter of 1 35 the average temperature is 9 c with an average monthly low of 1 8 c in january and monthly high of 15 5 c in july crops mainly consist of winter wheat triticale winter barley rye rapeseed and corn fertilizer inputs range from 130 to 190 kg n ha yr for nitrogen and from 20 to 30 kg p ha yr for phosphorus kistner et al 2013 point source inputs from sewage plants contribute only a limited share of the total nitrogen load about 2 9 and more than 95 of the households are connected to public wastewater treatment plants rode et al 2016a an extensive dataset is available to develop and calibrate a watershed model of the selke catchment a digital elevation model dem and soil type distributions were obtained from the state survey office with grid resolutions of 90 m and 50 m respectively land use was interpreted from corine land cover 2006 of germany https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover with grid resolution of 25 m the selke catchment represents one of the best meteorologically and hydrologically equipped catchments in central germany with long term monitoring of precipitation temperature discharge water quality etc there are 16 rainfall stations and two climate stations within or close to the selke catchment although only four rainfall stations have been running since 2010 daily rainfall data were provided by the german weather service stream discharge has been measured at three gauging stations namely silberhuette upstream meisdorf middle stream and hausneindorf catchment outlet since 1920 see fig 1 within the tereno terrestrial environmental observatories http teodoor icg kfa juelich de overview en set language en program continuous high frequency stream nitrate concentrations have been measured in situ at stream gauging stations at 15 min intervals since 2010 using trios props uv sensors with an optic path length of 10 mm rode et al 2016a wollschläger et al 2017 maintenance of the instruments and calibration of sensors are conducted fortnightly during instrument maintenance stream water samples are taken for laboratory analysis to validate in situ stream nitrate measurements and to measure other hydrochemical constituents that are not recorded by field instruments the measured nitrate concentrations obtained from laboratory analysis of fortnightly samples were used as the fortnightly nitrate dataset in this study the in situ nitrate concentrations were highly consistent with laboratory analysis data evidenced by an r2 coefficient of determination value of 0 93 rode et al 2016a the daily nitrate dataset adopted in the current model development consisted of arithmetic averages for each day of 15 min stream nitrate observations the average streamflow rates during 1994 2004 through the two most upstream stations i e both situated in the mountainous region were 1 30 m3 s silberhuette and 1 52 m3 s meisdorf while the streamflow rate at the lowland catchment outlet hausneindorf was 1 75 m3 s during the same period these flow rates amount to area weighted runoff i e the specific discharge from the catchments upstream of the silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf stations of 415 mm yr 265 mm yr and 133 mm yr respectively indicating that catchment runoff is significantly higher in upstream mountainous areas jiang et al 2014 the average streamflow rates during 2010 2015 were 0 82 1 45 and 1 59 m3 s from the gauging stations of silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf respectively the corresponding area weighted runoff values were 265 mm yr 241 mm yr and 128 mm yr taking the difference between average flow rates for the three gauging stations produces area weighted runoff values for the sub basin between silberhuette and meisdorf of 74 2 mm yr and for the sub basin area between meisdorf and hausneindorf stations of 44 1 mm yr the considerable reduction in area weighted runoff in downstream areas relative to upstream areas is attributable primarily to the rainfall gradient as mentioned above and the steeper topography of upland regions jiang et al 2014 the average stream nitrate concentrations were 1 44 1 75 and 3 91 mg l at silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf stations respectively during the period 1994 2004 based on fortnightly sampling using the 15 min nitrate measurements during 2010 2015 the average stream nitrate concentrations were 1 55 1 63 and 2 89 mg l at silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf stations respectively higher nitrate concentrations in lowland areas are likely caused by fertilizer applications and accompanying leaching into surface and subsurface pathways which flow to watercourses 2 2 hydrological and nitrogen export model hype was developed by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute based on the hydrological nutrient model hbv np lindström et al 2010 it has been widely used to simulate streamflow and nutrient export and to assess the impacts of agricultural practices on nutrient yields at catchments of different scales and with various meteorological hydrological and physiographical characteristics jiang et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 jomaa et al 2016 lindström et al 2010 strömqvist et al 2012 yin et al 2016 typical application of the hype model involves firstly delineating the study catchment into sub basins based on the dem and stream network each sub basin is divided into soil land use classes slcs by overlaying maps of land use and soil type with each slc corresponding to a so called hydrological response unit hru slcs are considered as the smallest computational spatial units the slcs are not coupled to geographic locations but defined as fractions of a sub basin area in each slc soil is divided vertically into one or several maximum three layers which may have different thicknesses hydrological and nutrient processes are simulated within each soil layer of each slc a detailed description of the model structure equations and parameters of hype are given by lindström et al 2010 and are therefore not repeated in detail here only a summary of the model structure hydrological and nitrogen processes parameter values and the methodology of applying hype are given below hype simulates a wide range of hydrological processes including snow accumulation and snowmelt evapotranspiration surface runoff infiltration macro pore flow percolation soil runoff tile drain flow regional groundwater flow and river flow lindström et al 2010 the water transit time is equal to the storage volume of a flow component e g interflow regional groundwater flow divided by the outflow from that component see eqs 1 3 below lindström et al 2010 and tonderski et al 2017 found that hype reproduced to a reasonable accuracy the temporal dynamics of groundwater levels and 18o isotope concentrations in both forested and agricultural catchments verifying the model s representation of water pathways and transit times the latter were found to be in the order of months to years the following equations link runoff rates to transit times in hype 1 q runf rc w soil α fc 2 q runf l a n d c l a s s q runf c area 3 t l a n d c l a s s w soil fc c area q runf where q runf is soil

content at the threshold for runoff mm and c area is the slc area m2 within hype sources of nutrient input to the soil include diffuse sources from applied organic and inorganic fertilizer manure plant residues atmospheric deposition and rural households and point sources from urban and industrial activities e g sewage treatment works the simulated stored mass of soil nitrogen consists of a fastn pool i e stored mass of organic nitrogen in the soil with rapid transformation to dissolved organic nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen a humusn pool i e stored mass of organic nitrogen in the soil with a slow transformation to fastn an organicn pool i e stored mass of organic nitrogen in the soil available for mineralization to inorganicn and an inorganicn pool i e stored mass of inorganic nitrogen in the soil the simulated nitrogen transformation processes are degradation mineralization denitrification and plant uptake within the soil profile and denitrification mineralization and primary production in the river nitrogen transport follows the same pathways as water in the model all nitrogen in the inorganic nitrogen pool is considered to be mobile and can hence be transported between soil layers or out of the profile through horizontal and lateral soil water flow and regional groundwater flow all biogeochemical processes in the soil regional groundwater streams and rivers are calculated by empirical equations that include first order reaction rates nutrient concentrations within each storage pool e g humusn fastn organicn inorganicn total phosphorus and influential environmental factors such as soil water content soil temperature water temperature and surface water volumes and surface areas lindström et al 2010 the hydrological and nitrogen export processes and the parameters for soil and surface water components in the hype model are listed in table 1 table 1 also includes parameter ranges considered plausible for the conditions encountered in selke these are based on knowledge of the relevant hydrological and nutrient processes literature review and previous hype applications to other german and swedish catchments such as weida rönneå and vindån e g jiang et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 jomaa et al 2016 lindström et al 2010 strömqvist et al 2012 2 3 load estimation using different frequencies of nitrate measurement the nitrate load was estimated from

the recorded discharge at 15 min intervals m3 s n is the number of flow measurements and n is the number of concentration measurements 2 4 model setup the hype model was set up to simulate a 5 year period which includes calibration i e 1st nov 2010 to 31st oct 2013 and validation 1st nov 2013 to 31st oct 2015 following the same procedure described by jiang et al 2014 the selke catchment was divided into 29 sub basins ranging from 0 05 to 48 km2 and averaging 15 1 km2 in area nineteen soil types and ten land use classes were adopted in categorizing the study area subsequently 117 slcs were defined by overlaying maps of soil type and land use the hydrological driving data of daily rainfall and temperature were obtained from observations at precipitation and climate stations located within each sub basin or through interpolation to nearby stations for streamflow simulation hydrological parameters obtained from the multi site calibration by jiang et al 2015 who used dream and data from the period 1994 1999 were used for nitrate modelling the input data representing agricultural management e g crop types dates of sowing and harvest fertilizer applications rate and timing of applications of mineral fertilizer organic fertilizer and manure plant residue and wet and dry atmospheric deposition of nitrogen were specified based on monitoring data field surveys and literature review e g jiang et al 2014 kistner et al 2013 point source inputs including daily discharge and average nitrate concentrations of wastewater outflows were set based on the recordings from the six wastewater treatment plants within the selke catchment 2 5 bayesian inference framework multi site calibration was adopted in exploring posterior distributions of nitrogen export process parameters that is nitrate datasets at both daily and fortnightly frequencies were obtained from all three gauging stations silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf to better capture spatial variability in the nitrate export processes jiang et al 2015 the calibration outputs using fortnightly and daily nitrate datasets were compared in terms of posterior parameter uncertainty and 95 prediction uncertainty of stream nitrate concentrations prior to calibration sensitivity analysis was implemented using pest to determine which parameters led to the largest modifications to model predictions parameter sensitivity is expressed as the relative composite sensitivity rcs which measures the composite changes in model outputs incurred by a fractional change in the value of the parameter doherty 2016 jiang et al 2014 the eight most sensitive nitrogen export process parameters were selected for calibration as listed in table 2 a uniform prior distribution was assumed for each of the eight parameters which were calibrated within the ranges specified in table 2 posterior parameter probability distributions and prediction uncertainty intervals were derived from calibration using the algorithm dream which adopts the bayesian inference framework i e statistical inference based on bayes theorem of restrictions to the probability distribution of prior parameter distributions using informative field data and the likelihood function to yield posterior parameter distributions by applying bayesian inference the posterior parameter distributions can be derived by adjusting the parameters so that the spatiotemporal behavior of the model approximates as closely and consistently as possible the observed system behavior over some historical period of time balin et al 2010 two types of prediction uncertainty were assessed namely parametric prediction uncertainty and total prediction uncertainty laloy and vrugt 2012 bayesian inference treats the uncertainty of mechanistic model predictions in a very similar way to that of statistical models uncertainty is decomposed into that which can be explained by the uncertain model parameters i e the parametric prediction uncertainty and that which is attributable to other uncalibrated factors the uncertainty that cannot be explained by model parameters is characterised by a statistical distribution of residuals i e the residual error the residual error accounts for both measurement errors and model structural error which are inseparable using the current approach at least from a statistical perspective some insights into measurement error and model structural error are possible by undertaking multiple dream analyses using modified forms of the model because by keeping the structure effectively the same and by changing the number of measurements it allows us to speculate on the likely breakdown of residual error into measurement error and model structural error the parametric prediction uncertainty is computed by running hype on the posterior parameter distributions following balin et al 2010 the total prediction uncertainty was determined using the statistical methods described below and was taken to be the sum of the parametric prediction uncertainty and the residual error balin et al 2010 yang et al 2008 the method for assessing the uncertainty of parameters and predictions is obtained from bayes theorem given by 6 p θ y obs l y obs θ p θ l y obs θ p θ d θ where p θ represents the assumed joint prior probability distribution of model parameters contained in vector θ l y obs θ is the likelihood function that quantifies the probability of measuring the field data y obs given different θ values and p θ y obs is the posterior probability that expresses our updated beliefs in the θ values after the field data y obs are taken into account through model calibration the denominator is a scaling constant representing the sum of the conditional probabilities l y obs θ weighted by their prior probabilities p θ ellison 1996 sequences of model realizations from the posterior parameter distributions were obtained in our case using markov chain monte carlo simulations the following likelihood function l y obs θ was used to compare the simulated stream nitrate concentration dynamics with the observed nitrate datasets assuming that the residuals between the observations and model results are identically independently and normally distributed yang et al 2007 7 l y obs θ i 0 n 1 2 π 1 σ e x p 1 2 y t i obs y t i m θ 2 σ 2 where y t i m θ and y t i obs represent respectively the simulated and observed nitrate concentrations at time t i and n is the total number of measurements σ is the standard deviation of the differences between the simulated and observed nitrate concentrations and is estimated jointly with model parameter θ three markov chains and a run length of 50 000 generations were used to ensure convergence of individual chains to the posterior distributions following the suggested standard parameter setting of dream laloy and vrugt 2012 the posterior statistics were calculated using a thin of 10 i e taking every 10th sample instead of using the entire markov chain to minimize the effect of sample autocorrelation we assessed convergence by visually inspecting plots of the posterior markov chains for mixing and stationarity and by inspecting density plots of the pooled posterior markov chains for unimodality we also assessed convergence quantitatively using the modified gelman rubin convergence statistic r stat 1 2 brooks and gelman 1998 the parameters and their physical meaning and relevant statistical information including prior uncertainty intervals rcs and posterior statistics maximum likelihood value map average value and standard deviation std of posterior parameter distributions are listed in table 2 for models based on daily and fortnightly nitrate datasets 2 6 assessment of model performance and uncertainty the model performance in terms of streamflow stream nitrate concentrations and nitrate loads was evaluated using commonly adopted statistical criteria including nash sutcliffe coefficient nse percent bias pbias average absolute error mae and ratio of the root average square error to the standard deviation of field data rsr jiang et al 2014 laloy and vrugt 2012 moriasi et al 2007 three criteria were used to evaluate the uncertainty of predictions of stream nitrate concentrations including average relative interval length aril the percentage of measurements embodied by the 95 uncertainty interval pci and the percentage of measurements bracketed by the unit uncertainty interval puci the concepts for these criteria are described in detail by jin et al 2010 and li et al 2011 and are therefore only summarised here aril quantifies the sharpness of 95 uncertainty intervals of model predictions i e parametric prediction uncertainty and total prediction uncertainty and measures the resolution of the estimated prediction uncertainty pci assesses the reliability of the estimated prediction uncertainty a smaller aril combined with a larger pci represents narrower uncertainty intervals and higher reliability in the estimation of predictive uncertainty puci is calculated using aril and pci as given below 8 aril 1 n limit upper t limit lower t r obs t 9 puci 1 0 a b s p c i 0 95 a r i l where limit upper t and limit lower t represent the respective upper and lower boundary values of the uncertainty interval of model predictions for the t th day n is the number of days and r obs t is the measured nitrate concentration on the t th day the larger the puci the higher the confidence in the 95 prediction uncertainty interval limits as being representative of the model prediction uncertainty i e both total prediction uncertainty and parametric prediction uncertainty were assessed using this method the above criteria have proven to be informative in evaluating the uncertainty of model predictions in previous studies jin et al 2010 jiang et al 2015 li et al 2011 3 results 3 1 streamflow simulation the streamflow dynamics evident in gauging station data are well represented by the hype model with nse 0 70 fig 2 table 3 the water balances are also relatively well captured with the largest pbias of 11 6 reflecting underestimation at hausneindorf during 1st nov 2010 31st oct 2013 underestimation of peak flows in extraordinary storm events in january 2011 is noted fig 2 this can be explained in part by the uncertainty of rainfall data whereby rainfall stations are sparsely distributed relative to changes in topography which causes high spatial variability in rainfall woodward et al 2017 moreover peak streamflow events are typically the result of short term intensive rainfall occurring at sub daily time scales and these are difficult to capture using a daily rainfall runoff model jiang et al 2014 lam et al 2012 woodward et al 2017 there is a small decline of model performance during 1st nov 2013 31st oct 2015 relative to 1st nov 2010 31st oct 2013 as reflected by a decrease in nse and increases in pbias and rsr table 3 this may be explained by considering that the hydrological conditions of these two periods are different in that the later period is drier a number of modelling studies have shown that hydrological parameters are not always temporally stable and their values depend greatly on the length and physio climatic conditions of the calibration period e g merz et al 2009 razavi and tolson 2013 patil and stieglitz 2015 the relatively robust model performance in terms of streamflow for the entire simulation period indicates that the model structure and parameter set are sound and transferable between different meteorological and therefore hydrological conditions 3 2 calibration of nitrogen export process parameters the sensitivity of nitrogen export process parameters was tested by determining changes in simulated stream nitrate concentrations relative to changes in each parameter value in application of pest for sensitivity analysis the overall sensitivity of each parameter was assessed by the magnitude of the respective vector of the jacobian matrix which contains derivatives of simulated nitrate concentrations with respect to parameter change based on sensitivity analysis using the daily nitrate dataset the calibrated parameters are listed in order of most to least sensitive uptsoil102 fertdays denitr uptsoil107 uptsoil108 rivvel2 wprodn and denitw this is a similar order to that derived from sensitivity analysis using the fortnightly nitrate dataset parameters rivvel2 and denitw are reversed in their order when the fortnightly dataset was adopted as uptsoil102 is the most sensitive parameter this suggests that plant uptake in agricultural land is an important process controlling the nitrate balance within hype simulations the parameters fertdays and denitr which designate fertilizer applications and denitrification within the soil respectively are also very sensitive as expected except for the parameter uptsoil107 the maximum likelihood parameter values derived from calibration using fortnightly and daily datasets were similar however the posterior parameter distributions derived from calibration using fortnightly and daily nitrate datasets quantified in terms of average parameter values and standard deviations table 2 were decidedly different specifically the daily nitrate dataset produced much narrower posterior parameter uncertainty intervals relative to the fortnightly nitrate dataset as indicated by standard deviations that were lower by more than an order of magnitude except for denitr table 2 that is it appears from these results that application of the daily dataset improved significantly the confidence in nitrogen export process parameters 3 3 nitrate export simulation seasonal stream nitrate variations are characterized by high winter concentrations and low summer concentrations fig 3 the dynamics and overall nitrate balance were well captured at upland stations silberhuette and meisdorf following calibration to either daily or fortnightly nitrate datasets with the lowest nse equal to 0 43 and the largest pbias equal to 17 3 table 4 nitrate concentrations in the stream remain high during high flow conditions in winter this is attributable to the following processes a nitrate contained in soil and groundwater stores is flushed by higher rates of subsurface flow b plant uptake is rather low the average simulated uptake rate was lowest on average during january due to low temperature and almost no agricultural activity conversely nitrate concentrations in summer are low because a lower runoff leads to longer retention times within the catchment stream discharge was lowest on average during august which creates reduced rates of nutrient discharge to streams as nutrient storage levels build in the catchment and subsurface nitrate losses occur prior to discharge to streams and b higher temperatures and more intensive agricultural activities increase biogeochemical activity leading to enhanced plant uptake the monthly average uptake was highest in june the dominant influence of subsurface flow on nitrate export and the strong effect of temperature on nitrate seasonal variability were also reported by shrestha et al 2007 from their nitrate export modelling study of weida catchment central germany the underestimation of nitrate concentrations in high flow events at upland sites is perhaps caused partly by the underestimation of runoff and the associated flushing of nutrients from the subsurface although there may also be enhanced subsurface contributions to stream nitrate loads that are not well captured by the simple representation of aquifers in hype at hausneindorf nitrate variability is lower than at the upland stations silberhuette meisdorf a declining trend in nitrate concentrations was observed at the lowland station hausneindorf whereby the average measured nitrate concentration was 3 28 mg l in the calibration period and 1 28 mg l in the validation period there is some evidence of overestimation of nitrate concentrations during low flow conditions in summer that is probably attributable to the omission of denitrification in deep groundwater flow in the current model and measurement errors knowledge gaps related to nutrient sources at silberhuette model performance in terms of nitrate concentrations using parameters calibrated against the daily nitrate dataset is almost consistently better than that obtained from calibration against the fortnightly nitrate dataset except for the slightly larger bias during the validation period table 4 at meisdorf and hausneindorf the daily nitrate dataset outperformed the fortnightly nitrate dataset for both calibration and validation periods as shown by the higher nse and lower pbias mae and rsr this indicates that nitrogen export process parameters calibrated using the daily nitrate dataset better represent nitrate dynamics occurring at a daily resolution relative to the parameters obtained from calibration to fortnightly nitrate sampling whereas the abovementioned analysis of the daily and fortnightly datasets relied on comparison of daily predictions and measurements the performance of both the daily calibrated and fortnightly calibrated models using fortnightly model outputs and measurements was also evaluated this was aimed at testing whether the fortnightly calibrated model better simulated fortnightly measurements relative to the daily calibrated model i e to evaluate whether the time step of calibration controls which measurement frequency daily or fortnightly is best reproduced by the model the results are given only in summary for brevity the results indicate that the daily calibrated model better reproduces fortnightly measurements relative to the fortnightly calibrated model this is demonstrated by nse values closer to one and pbias values closer to zero for the daily calibrated model for all stations specifically values in brackets are for fortnightly calibrated and daily calibrated models respectively at silberhuette nse 0 56 0 67 and pbias 26 4 12 5 at meisdorf nse 0 41 0 47 and pbias 18 6 0 34 and at hausneindorf nse 0 98 0 50 and pbias 15 0 5 0 the good reproduction of seasonal dynamics of streamflow and nitrate concentrations leads to daily nitrate loads that are reasonably well captured by the daily calibrated model fig 4 the underestimation of daily nitrate loads during storm flow events is the combined result of the underestimation of streamflow and the underestimation of nitrate concentrations as described earlier see figs 2 and 3 daily nitrate loads are overestimated during low flow conditions especially at hausneindorf where the model overestimates nitrate concentrations although the influence on annual nitrate loads is limited given the small contribution of low flow conditions to annual loads calibration against measured nitrate loads i e the product of measured streamflow and nitrate concentration would likely improve load estimates obtained from hype however the focus here is on nitrate concentrations rather than loads so we prefer not to increase errors in reproducing streamflow or nitrate concentrations by adding nitrate loads to the calibration objective function in any case hype captures the temporal and spatial variability of daily nitrate loads satisfactorily using parameters calibrated against either daily or fortnightly nitrate datasets as demonstrated through the calibration and validation statistics given in table 4 the spatial variations in predicted area averaged nitrate loads 2010 2015 from calibration using fortnightly or daily nitrate data are similar characterized by generally higher loads in lowland agricultural sub basins and lower loads in upland forest sub basins fig 5 annual nitrate yields are not only controlled by land use but are also highly dependent on hydrological regimes for example low nitrate loads are observed in some first order lowland agricultural sub basins this is attributable to relatively smaller rates of runoff which is a consequence of the shallow slope of the land surface and the lower rainfall of lowland areas also subsurface fluxes of nutrients are reduced by the low soil permeability chernozems conversely relatively higher loads in upland forest sub basins arise where the runoff is higher due to steeper slopes and where there is higher permeability in the upland soils cambisols leading to shorter retention times and enhanced transport of nitrate to streams the variability in annual nitrate loads obtained from hype are within reasonable ranges compared to that obtained from nitrate export modelling studies of catchments with similar meteorological hydrological and land use patterns for example our nitrate loads fall in the range of 0 15 21 99 kg ha yr while ahmad et al 2011 and rode et al 2009 obtained ranges of a similar order namely 0 84 4 98 kg ha yr and 18 5 41 2 kg ha yr respectively for catchments with comparable characteristics to the selke catchment 3 4 uncertainty in nitrate concentration predictions the time averaged parametric prediction uncertainty interval and total prediction uncertainty interval of nitrate concentrations over the calibration period at silberhuette obtained from calibration using the fortnightly dataset are 1 40 0 23 mg l and 1 40 1 95 mg l respectively the values reflect the time averaged predicted nitrate concentration plus minus half of the difference between the upper and lower limits of time averaged nitrate predictions in comparison the corresponding time averaged uncertainty intervals obtained from calibration using the daily dataset are 1 49 0 056 mg l and 1 49 1 80 mg l respectively at meisdorf the time averaged uncertainty intervals obtained from calibration using the daily dataset are 1 56 0 058 mg l parametric prediction uncertainty and 1 56 1 80 mg l total prediction uncertainty while corresponding values of 1 37 0 24 mg l and 1 37 1 95 mg l were obtained from calibration using the fortnightly dataset at hausneindorf the daily dataset led to corresponding time averaged uncertainty intervals of 3 26 0 090 mg l and 3 26 1 80 mg l while 3 26 0 40 mg l and 3 26 1 98 mg l were obtained from calibration to fortnightly data the calibration results indicate that increasing the measurement frequency from fortnightly to daily also led to a four fold reduction in the posterior parameter uncertainty table 2 however in both the daily and fortnightly models the parametric prediction uncertainty intervals are only a small proportion 3 daily models and 12 fortnightly models at both silberhuette and meisdorf and 5 daily models and 20 fortnightly models at hausneindorf of the total prediction uncertainty intervals the small contribution of parametric prediction uncertainty to total prediction uncertainty is also reflected by the much lower aril for both calibrated models using the alternative measurement frequencies fig 6 and table 5 changing from fortnightly to daily calibration datasets produced only a modest lowering of the total prediction uncertainty which was almost entirely attributable to the reduction in the posterior parameter uncertainty thus the residual error was only slightly modified by the change to the calibration data frequency with residual error in the model calibrated to daily data slight larger 9 at silberhuette and meisdorf and 15 at hausneindorf than that of the model calibrated to fortnightly data inferences can be drawn from the finding that residual error is largely unmodified between the two calibration cases for example it is likely that the 14 fold increase approximately in calibration data between the fortnightly to daily calibrated models introduces larger measurement errors into the estimation of total prediction uncertainty and an increase in residual error is a logical outcome of this if the small increase in residual error is entirely the result of measurement error then measurement errors are themselves rather small given the approximately 14 fold increase in the dataset size this presumes that model structural error remains unchanged between the two calibration attempts given that the vast majority of the model design is identical in both calibration attempts this presumption seems plausible if we speculate based on these results that measurement error is indeed small it infers that the model structural error is considerable because it would consequently account for the majority of the total prediction uncertainty given that parametric prediction uncertainty is also modest as calibration using daily nitrate dataset results in decreased posterior parameter uncertainty table 2 and predictive uncertainty fig 6 and table 5 we take from this that daily stream nitrate measurements enhance the confidence of predicted nitrate export the assertions made here that total nitrate predictive uncertainty is mainly attributed to the combination of model structural error and measurement errors in our case is consistent with findings from previous studies e g balin et al 2010 jiang et al 2015 wellen et al 2014 woodward et al 2017 yang et al 2007 about 25 and 8 1 of nitrate measurements are contained within the 95 parametric prediction uncertainty intervals as derived from calibration using fortnightly and daily nitrate datasets respectively the 95 total prediction uncertainty intervals capture 100 and 97 3 of nitrate measurements for models calibrated to fortnightly and daily nitrate datasets respectively indicating that both nitrate datasets produce reliable total prediction uncertainty intervals the puci estimated from calibration to daily nitrate dataset was much larger than that obtained from calibration using the fortnightly nitrate dataset in terms of both parametric prediction uncertainty intervals and total prediction uncertainty intervals table 5 this suggests that daily nitrate measurements are more informative to the calibration process and subsequently offer greater constraints on nitrate transport and transformation parameters used in hype consequently the daily nitrate dataset is more likely to produce unique parameters 4 discussion the uncertainty analysis results highlight that regardless of the frequency of calibration data residual errors model structural error and measurement error dominate the uncertainty of the hype predictions of nitrate concentrations and loads calibration aims to reduce other uncertainty sources and hence the primary source of uncertainty within our modelling framework is immutable to calibration given that the alternative measurement frequencies considered in this study translate to model modifications via calibration it seems probable that changing the measurement frequency is unlikely to affect model performance in a major way indeed the greater number of measurements within the higher frequency dataset may lead to increased measurement error depending on several complicating factors in our case the residual error increased only slightly with the reduction in the measurement frequency woodward et al 2017 obtained similar findings from their nutrient modelling study of the weida catchment germany they compared daily and monthly calibrations datasets spanning a four year period and found that monthly nitrate sampling provided sufficient information for the calibration of their low spatial resolution catchment model streamgem they evaluated sources of uncertainty using similar methods to those implemented here and found consistent with our results that model structure and measurement error dominate total prediction uncertainty however they did not assess the impact of nitrate measurement frequencies on the posterior parameter uncertainty of their parsimonious catchment model they were unable to separate measurement error and model structural error within the total prediction uncertainty i e the same limitation of our method despite the dominant role of residual error in the total prediction uncertainty calibration using daily nitrate data reduced total prediction uncertainty relative to fortnightly sampling table 2 table 5 and fig 6 albeit to a modest degree while model reliability was only marginally better following calibration to the higher frequency data significant reductions in parametric prediction uncertainty were achieved thus the key advantage of the higher frequency data was that higher confidence was instilled in the model parameters arising from the improved calibration of nitrogen export process parameters in practical terms this means that the nitrate transport and transformation processes can be investigated with higher certainty and the model is expected to provide useful assistance in refining the model to improve model structure and to guide the parameterization of nutrient inputs while residual error dominated total prediction uncertainty and inhibited the benefit of raising the frequency of calibration data in our case we expect that the total predictive uncertainty of models with smaller residual error lower model structural error and or measurement error will be reduced more significantly from higher frequency water quality monitoring there are several options for reducing the structural error in the current hype model for instance denitrification could be added to the deep groundwater flow to account for the nitrate losses and attenuation in nitrate inputs that occur within longer subsurface flow paths prior to the base flow discharge of groundwater to streams additional sampling of the groundwater chemistry and heads would also assist in understanding nitrate processes in the subsurface and the groundwater impacts on stream nitrate concentrations more generally other advancements to the hype model are also possible for reducing structural error for example the simulation of in stream biogeochemical processes could be modified to better account for the effects of flow velocity sediment properties and light availability etc higher resolution nitrate monitoring in stream networks enables the temporal and spatial variability in nitrate transformations in response to changes in climatic hydrological conditions and biogeochemical activities to be captured higher resolution inputs to watershed nitrate export models allows for improved parameterization of in stream biogeochemical processes and nutrient uptake and exchange rates additionally the importance of nutrient retention in estimating nutrient loads at the catchment scale has been demonstrated in previous investigations e g grizzetti et al 2003 our investigation would benefit from further efforts to match nutrient storage levels to field measurements of nutrient mass in the various hydrological components of the selke catchment the model s structure could also be modified to create greater temporal and spatial flexibility within the calibration process such that parameters that are presently fixed in time and or space are discretized to finer resolutions for example some parameters in hype e g uptsoil1 denitr that are presently constant in time could be at least seasonally variable the benefits of adopting temporally variable rather than time invariant parameters to account for variability in nutrient processes and hydrological controls has been demonstrated in previous rainfall runoff and nutrient export investigations e g kim 2016 vandenberghe et al 2007 viswanathan et al 2016 however temporal variability is difficult to justify for some parameters both from the perspective of physical process understanding and in terms of the availability of field data to constrain temporal parameter trends higher resolution nitrate data may allow for the estimation of temporally variable parameters e g between low and high flow conditions thereby reducing errors in process based watershed nutrient export modelling that arise from the assumption of parameter time invariance this may address the problem that arises from lower frequency water quality monitoring in that short period flow events that produce the greatest nutrient fluxes are poorly resolved rode et al 2016b the evaluation of model uncertainty has direct consequences for catchment management strategies that focus on nutrient transport for example the benefit of daily sampling depends on the availability of high quality field monitoring that impart small measurement errors on the calibration effort knowledge of high frequency nutrient behavior also allows for greater understanding of catchment processes leading to model designs that better represent the key factors that impact nutrient concentrations and loads and thereby lowering the model structural error also the results of this investigation offer useful insights into catchment nutrient behavior e g the spatial and temporal variability in nutrient fluxes assessment of the nutrient balance for the study area etc for the purposes of managing human activities of this region in order to develop guidance on water quality monitoring for the current study area and in extending the findings to other regions the results of this investigation need to incorporate other sources of information for example the design of water quality monitoring programs in terms of selecting appropriate monitoring parameters sampling sites and sampling frequencies is dependent on the monitoring objectives budgetary constraints and field dependent characteristics e g catchment size land use episodicity of rainfall etc strobl et al 2006 that influence the need to capture short term fluctuations and extremes indeed according to the review of existing water quality monitoring strategies by behmel et al 2016 there is no holistic solution or guidance that covers all aspects of water quality monitoring programs nevertheless the current study offers helpful insights to assist practitioners in selecting an appropriate temporal resolution of nitrate monitoring for example we show that fortnightly sampling of stream nitrate concentrations may be sufficient for credible calibration of nitrogen export process parameters and satisfactory simulation of nitrate loads alternatively daily sampling may be necessary to improve the confidence in calibration of nitrogen export process parameters and to decrease parametric and overall prediction uncertainty of stream nitrate concentrations while the choice of monitoring frequency will depend on several factors e g measurement accuracy modelling objectives knowledge of nutrient transport processes etc as discussed above in catchments similar to selke fortnightly sampling appears to be adequate for the calibration of semi distributed models such as hype if assessment of model uncertainty is not key to the aims of model development otherwise daily monitoring data are preferred for attaining defensible and robust model parameters that more likely produce reasonable future predictions of catchment behavior in addition to the modelling outcomes the methodology adopted in our investigation in the form of combined application of dream and hype provides a useful and novel example of uncertainty evaluation of a nitrate export model we contend that the methodology adopted here offers a blueprint for investigating other catchments where the role of chemical measurement frequency or other aspects of model development are of interest while there is an unavoidable element of localization in the uncertainty findings it would be arguably less convincing to attempt to draw the same conclusions from a synthetic example or to use non specific theoretical constructs in developing knowledge of the effects of sampling frequency on model uncertainty the current research uses a real world example to provide the first attempt at assessing in a comprehensive manner model uncertainty accompanying alternative temporal resolutions of sampling we anticipate that others will report their findings regarding sampling frequency for different catchments and modelling methodologies over time thereby building on our initial efforts to provide guidance on hydrochemical sampling frequency perhaps future research can attempt to assess nutrient behavior at the catchment scale based on calibration to sub daily water quality monitoring this may assist in advancing the current understanding of nutrient transport processes although the current findings indicate that the application of sub daily measurements would require lower model structural error this is beyond the capability of the current model and the scope of this study other opportunities to extend the current study include the application of alternative uncertainty analysis strategies aimed at identifying the relative contributions of individual modelling components to nitrate export uncertainty this could assist in determining which model structures should be modified to create lower model structural error to confirm or otherwise our conjecture that residual errors are most likely dominated by model structural errors rather than measurement errors within the total prediction uncertainty of the current modelling effort 5 conclusions fortnightly and daily stream nitrate measurements are compared in terms of their utility as calibration datasets in the simulation of nitrate export from a heterogeneous mesoscale catchment selke in germany comparisons are provided in terms of posterior parameter uncertainty of nitrogen export process parameters calibration mismatch parametric prediction uncertainty residual errors and total prediction uncertainty to this end the dream code proved effective for the calibration and uncertainty analysis of a process oriented catchment hydrological model hype results show that calibrated nitrogen export process parameter values using fortnightly and daily nitrate datasets are similar although calibration using daily nitrate dataset generates much narrower posterior parameter uncertainty intervals thus higher resolution nutrient data led to greater confidence in model parameters the dynamics of daily stream nitrate concentrations and nitrate loads are captured satisfactorily at forest dominated upland sub basins without significant differences in model performance obtained from calibration using fortnightly and daily nitrate datasets this suggests that fortnightly nitrate sampling provides sufficient measurements for calibration of nitrogen export process parameters in regions of the model where agriculture is less intense resulting in satisfactory simulation of nitrate export in forested catchments calibration using the daily nitrate dataset better represented fortnightly nitrate measurements relative to calibration using fortnightly nitrate sampling and thus the daily nitrate dataset has instilled better process representation in the model mismatches in simulation of nitrate concentrations during low flow conditions and at lowland agricultural sub basin are noted this is attributed primarily to model structural errors such as a insufficient denitrification in deep groundwater flow b over simplification of in stream biogeochemical processes and c measurement errors in diffuse and point nutrient sources the daily nitrate dataset produced significantly smaller parametric prediction uncertainty but as this is only a small proportion of total prediction uncertainty the higher frequency dataset led to only modest reduction in total prediction uncertainty this study concludes that changing nitrate measurement frequency did not have a significant effect on the reproduction of observed stream nitrate dynamics and the total uncertainty of nitrate predictions more generally because the combination of model structural error and measurement errors were much higher relative to parametric prediction uncertainty however increasing measurement frequency could more significantly affect the accuracy of nitrate export simulation if the measurement errors are reduced and more advanced model structures are developed and utilized in the future acknowledgments this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china 41877487 41501531 natural

6746,high frequency water quality monitoring is increasingly used in examining the nutrient fluxes within catchments despite this no studies have assessed the impact of monitoring frequency on the uncertainty of nitrate estimates obtained from distributed or semi distributed catchment models this study aims to evaluate the impacts of two different frequencies of nitrate sampling on the performance of a catchment hydrology model including the uncertainty in both predictions and calibrated parameters the investigation uses the hype model to simulate streamflow and nitrate concentrations 2010 2015 in the selke catchment a heterogeneous mesoscale catchment in central germany the bayesian inference scheme of the dream code was employed for calibration and uncertainty analysis and to explore differences between fortnightly and daily nitrate sampling strategies the results indicate that a the posterior uncertainty intervals of nitrogen export process parameters were narrower when the model was calibrated to daily nitrate measurements while similar maximum likelihood parameter values were obtained regardless of the sampling frequency b the model calibrated using daily nitrate data better represented both daily and fortnightly nitrate measurements relative to that obtained using fortnightly sampling c the daily nitrate dataset produced significantly smaller parametric prediction uncertainty but only modest reduction in total prediction uncertainty relative to the fortnightly nitrate dataset d model structural error and measurement errors are the primary sources of total prediction uncertainty and these combine to inhibit the benefits of high frequency monitoring we conclude that the adequacy of sampling frequency is dependent on model structure and measurement errors such that higher frequency nitrate monitoring may not markedly reduce the uncertainty of nutrient predictions depending on other levels and sources of uncertainty keywords nitrate

et al 2017 showed that the simple lumped parameter daily time step catchment model streamgem predicted similar nitrate dynamics when calibrated using either monthly nitrate data or daily nitrate data several studies have similarly concluded that nitrate export modelling based on long term monthly nitrate datasets potentially represent reasonably well the seasonal dynamics of stream nitrate concentrations and loads jiang et al 2014 pathak et al 2018 woodward et al 2017 the general conclusion arising from these investigations is that monthly sampling may be sufficient to support water resource management decision making however other studies demonstrate that low frequency water quality sampling may restrict the calibration and validation of catchment nutrient export models chappell

example skarbøvik et al 2012 reported that the reliability of average concentrations of suspended particulate matter improved with decreasing sampling interval i e from monthly to daily such that sampling at monthly intervals resulted in underestimation of sediment loads of up to 98 this arises because fortnightly to monthly sampling frequencies may miss significant nutrient and or sediment

investigations of the selke catchment by a subset of the current author list that is jiang et al 2014 evaluated the capability of the hype model to represent spatial and temporal variability in nitrogen fluxes while jiang et al 2015 assessed the impact of the spatial resolution in nitrogen observations on nitrogen export modelling again using the hype model the process based hype model was utilized again in the current investigation to simulate streamflow and stream water nitrate concentrations among the available codes the hype model requires readily available meteorological data rainfall temperature and offers apposite balance between representation of hydrological nutrient export processes and model complexity it has been applied successfully to the simulation of streamflow and water quality for catchments with a wide range of meteorological hydrological and physiographic characteristics but importantly this includes catchments that have features similar to the study

summer and winter of 1 35 the average temperature is 9 c with an average monthly low of 1 8 c in january and monthly high of 15 5 c in july crops mainly consist of winter wheat triticale winter barley rye rapeseed and corn fertilizer inputs range from 130 to 190 kg n ha yr for nitrogen and from 20 to 30 kg p ha yr for phosphorus kistner et al 2013 point source inputs from sewage plants contribute only a limited share of the total nitrogen load about 2 9 and more than 95 of the households are connected to public wastewater treatment plants rode et al 2016a an extensive dataset is available to develop and calibrate a watershed model of the selke catchment a digital elevation model dem and soil type distributions were obtained from the state survey office with grid resolutions of 90 m and 50 m respectively land use was interpreted from corine land cover 2006 of germany https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover with grid resolution of 25 m the selke catchment represents one of the best meteorologically and hydrologically equipped catchments in central germany with long term monitoring of precipitation temperature discharge water quality etc there are 16 rainfall stations and two climate stations within or close to the selke catchment although only four rainfall stations have been running since 2010 daily rainfall data were provided by the german weather service stream discharge has been measured at three gauging stations namely silberhuette upstream meisdorf middle stream and hausneindorf catchment outlet since 1920 see fig 1 within the tereno terrestrial environmental observatories http teodoor icg kfa juelich de overview en set language en program continuous high frequency stream nitrate concentrations have been measured in situ at stream gauging stations at 15 min intervals since 2010 using trios props uv sensors with an optic path length of 10 mm rode et al 2016a wollschläger et al 2017 maintenance of the instruments and calibration of sensors are conducted fortnightly during instrument maintenance stream water samples are taken for laboratory analysis to validate in situ stream nitrate measurements and to measure other hydrochemical constituents that are not recorded by field instruments the measured nitrate concentrations obtained from laboratory analysis of fortnightly samples were used as the fortnightly nitrate dataset in this study the in situ nitrate concentrations were highly consistent with laboratory analysis data evidenced by an r2 coefficient of determination value of 0 93 rode et al 2016a the daily nitrate dataset adopted in the current model development consisted of arithmetic averages for each day of 15 min stream nitrate observations the average streamflow rates during 1994 2004 through the two most upstream stations i e both situated in the mountainous region were 1 30 m3 s silberhuette and 1 52 m3 s meisdorf while the streamflow rate at the lowland catchment outlet hausneindorf was 1 75 m3 s during the same period these flow rates amount to area weighted runoff i e the specific discharge from the catchments upstream of the silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf stations of 415 mm yr 265 mm yr and 133 mm yr respectively indicating that catchment runoff is significantly higher in upstream mountainous areas jiang et al 2014 the average streamflow rates during 2010 2015 were 0 82 1 45 and 1 59 m3 s from the gauging stations of silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf respectively the corresponding area weighted runoff values were 265 mm yr 241 mm yr and 128 mm yr taking the difference between average flow rates for the three gauging stations produces area weighted runoff values for the sub basin between silberhuette and meisdorf of 74 2 mm yr and for the sub basin area between meisdorf and hausneindorf stations of 44 1 mm yr the considerable reduction in area weighted runoff in downstream areas relative to upstream areas is attributable primarily to the rainfall gradient as mentioned above and the steeper topography of upland regions jiang et al 2014 the average stream nitrate concentrations were 1 44 1 75 and 3 91 mg l at silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf stations respectively during the period 1994 2004 based on fortnightly sampling using the 15 min nitrate measurements during 2010 2015 the average stream nitrate concentrations were 1 55 1 63 and 2 89 mg l at silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf stations respectively higher nitrate concentrations in lowland areas are likely caused by fertilizer applications and accompanying leaching into surface and subsurface pathways which flow to watercourses 2 2 hydrological and nitrogen export model hype was developed by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute based on the hydrological nutrient model hbv np lindström et al 2010 it has been widely used to simulate streamflow and nutrient export and to assess the impacts of agricultural practices on nutrient yields at catchments of different scales and with various meteorological hydrological and physiographical characteristics jiang et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 jomaa et al 2016 lindström et al 2010 strömqvist et al 2012 yin et al 2016 typical application of the hype model involves firstly delineating the study catchment into sub basins based on the dem and stream network each sub basin is divided into soil land use classes slcs by overlaying maps of land use and soil type with each slc corresponding to a so called hydrological response unit hru slcs are considered as the smallest computational spatial units the slcs are not coupled to geographic locations but defined as fractions of a sub basin area in each slc soil is divided vertically into one or several maximum three layers which may have different thicknesses hydrological and nutrient processes are simulated within each soil layer of each slc a detailed description of the model structure equations and parameters of hype are given by lindström et al 2010 and are therefore not repeated in detail here only a summary of the model structure hydrological and nitrogen processes parameter values and the methodology of applying hype are given below hype simulates a wide range of hydrological processes including snow accumulation and snowmelt evapotranspiration surface runoff infiltration macro pore flow percolation soil runoff tile drain flow regional groundwater flow and river flow lindström et al 2010 the water transit time is equal to the storage volume of a flow component e g interflow regional groundwater flow divided by the outflow from that component see eqs 1 3 below lindström et al 2010 and tonderski et al 2017 found that hype reproduced to a reasonable accuracy the temporal dynamics of groundwater levels and 18o isotope concentrations in both forested and agricultural catchments verifying the model s representation of water pathways and transit times the latter were found to be in the order of months to years the

plant residues atmospheric deposition and rural households and point sources from urban and industrial activities e g sewage treatment works the simulated stored mass of soil nitrogen consists of a

primary production in the river nitrogen transport follows the same pathways as water in the model all nitrogen in the inorganic nitrogen pool is considered to be mobile and can hence be transported between soil layers or out of the profile through horizontal and lateral soil water flow and regional groundwater flow all biogeochemical processes in the soil regional groundwater streams and rivers are calculated by empirical equations that include first order reaction rates nutrient concentrations within each storage pool e g humusn fastn organicn inorganicn total phosphorus and influential

are based on knowledge of the relevant hydrological and nutrient processes literature review and previous hype applications to other german and swedish catchments such as weida rönneå and vindån e g

period which includes calibration i e 1st nov 2010 to 31st oct 2013 and validation 1st nov 2013 to 31st oct 2015 following the same procedure described by jiang et al 2014 the selke catchment was divided into 29 sub basins ranging from 0 05 to 48 km2 and averaging 15 1 km2 in area nineteen soil types and ten land use classes were adopted in categorizing the study area subsequently 117 slcs were defined by overlaying maps of soil type and land use the hydrological driving data of daily rainfall and temperature were obtained from observations at precipitation and climate stations located within each sub basin or through interpolation to nearby stations for streamflow simulation hydrological parameters obtained from the multi site calibration by jiang et al 2015 who used dream and data from the period 1994 1999 were used for nitrate modelling the input data representing agricultural management e g crop types dates of sowing and harvest fertilizer applications rate and timing of applications of mineral fertilizer organic fertilizer and manure plant residue and wet and dry atmospheric deposition of nitrogen were specified based on monitoring data field surveys and literature review e g jiang et al 2014 kistner et al 2013 point source inputs including daily discharge and average nitrate concentrations of wastewater outflows were set based on the recordings from the six wastewater treatment plants within the selke catchment 2 5 bayesian inference framework multi site calibration was adopted in exploring posterior distributions of nitrogen export process parameters that is nitrate datasets at both daily and fortnightly frequencies were obtained from all three gauging stations silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf to better capture spatial variability in the nitrate export processes jiang et al 2015 the calibration outputs using fortnightly and daily nitrate datasets were compared in terms of posterior parameter uncertainty and 95 prediction uncertainty of stream nitrate concentrations prior to calibration sensitivity analysis was implemented using pest to determine which parameters led to the largest modifications to model predictions parameter sensitivity is expressed as the relative composite sensitivity rcs which measures the composite changes in model outputs incurred by a fractional change in the value of the parameter doherty 2016 jiang et al 2014 the eight most sensitive nitrogen export process parameters were selected for calibration as listed in table 2 a uniform prior distribution was assumed for each of the eight parameters which were calibrated within the ranges specified in table 2 posterior parameter probability distributions and prediction uncertainty intervals were derived from calibration using the algorithm dream which adopts the bayesian inference framework i e statistical inference based on bayes theorem of restrictions to the probability distribution of prior parameter distributions using informative field data and the likelihood function to yield posterior parameter distributions by applying bayesian inference the posterior parameter distributions can be derived by adjusting the parameters so that the spatiotemporal behavior of the model approximates as closely and consistently as possible the observed system behavior over some historical period of time balin et al 2010 two types of prediction uncertainty were assessed namely parametric prediction uncertainty and total prediction uncertainty laloy and vrugt 2012 bayesian inference treats the uncertainty of mechanistic model predictions in a very similar way to that of statistical models uncertainty is decomposed into that which can be explained by the uncertain model parameters i e the parametric prediction uncertainty and that which is attributable to other uncalibrated factors the uncertainty that cannot be explained by model parameters is characterised by a statistical distribution of residuals i e the residual error the residual error accounts for both measurement errors and model structural error which are inseparable using the current approach at least from a statistical perspective some insights into measurement error and model structural error are possible by undertaking multiple dream analyses using modified forms of the model because by keeping the structure effectively the same and by changing the number of measurements it allows us to speculate on the likely breakdown of residual error into measurement error and model structural error the parametric prediction uncertainty is computed by running hype on the posterior parameter distributions following balin et al 2010 the total prediction uncertainty was determined using the statistical methods described below and was taken to be the sum of the parametric prediction uncertainty and the residual error balin et al 2010 yang et al 2008 the method for assessing the uncertainty of parameters and predictions is obtained from bayes theorem given by 6 p θ y obs l y obs θ p θ l y obs θ p θ d θ where p θ represents the assumed joint prior probability distribution of model parameters contained in vector θ l y obs θ is the likelihood function that quantifies the probability of measuring the field data y obs given different θ values and p θ y obs is the posterior probability that expresses our updated beliefs in the θ values after the field data y obs are taken into account through model calibration the denominator is a scaling constant representing the sum of the conditional probabilities l y obs θ weighted by their prior probabilities p θ ellison 1996 sequences of model realizations from the posterior parameter distributions were obtained in our case using markov chain monte carlo simulations the following likelihood function l y obs θ was used to compare the simulated stream nitrate concentration dynamics with the observed nitrate datasets assuming that the residuals between the observations and model results are identically independently and normally distributed yang et al 2007 7 l y obs θ i 0 n 1 2 π 1 σ e x p 1 2 y t i obs y t i m θ 2 σ 2 where y t i m θ and y t i obs represent respectively the simulated and observed nitrate concentrations at time t i and n is the total number of measurements σ is the standard deviation of the differences between the simulated and observed nitrate concentrations and is estimated jointly with model parameter θ three markov chains and a run length of 50 000 generations were used to ensure convergence of individual chains to the posterior distributions following the suggested standard parameter setting of dream laloy and vrugt 2012 the posterior statistics were calculated using a thin of 10 i e taking every 10th sample instead of using the entire markov chain to minimize the effect of sample autocorrelation we assessed convergence by visually inspecting plots of the posterior markov chains for mixing and stationarity and by inspecting density plots of the pooled posterior markov chains for unimodality we also assessed convergence quantitatively using the modified gelman rubin convergence statistic r stat 1 2 brooks and gelman 1998 the parameters and their physical meaning and relevant statistical information including prior uncertainty intervals rcs and posterior statistics maximum likelihood value map average value and standard deviation std of posterior parameter distributions are listed in table 2 for models based on daily and fortnightly nitrate datasets 2 6 assessment of model performance and uncertainty the model performance in terms of streamflow stream nitrate concentrations and nitrate loads was evaluated using commonly adopted statistical criteria including nash sutcliffe coefficient nse percent bias pbias average absolute error mae and ratio of the root average square error to the standard deviation of field data rsr jiang et al 2014 laloy and vrugt 2012 moriasi et al 2007 three criteria were used to evaluate the uncertainty of predictions of stream nitrate concentrations including average relative interval length aril the percentage of measurements embodied by the 95 uncertainty interval pci and the percentage of measurements bracketed by the unit uncertainty interval puci the concepts for these criteria are described in detail by jin et al 2010 and li et al 2011 and are therefore only summarised here aril quantifies the sharpness of 95 uncertainty intervals of model predictions i e parametric prediction uncertainty and total prediction uncertainty and measures the resolution of the estimated prediction uncertainty pci assesses the reliability of the estimated prediction uncertainty a smaller aril combined with a larger pci represents narrower uncertainty intervals and higher reliability in the estimation of predictive uncertainty puci is calculated using aril and pci as given below 8 aril 1 n limit upper t limit lower t r obs t 9 puci 1 0 a b s p c i 0 95 a r i l where limit upper t and limit lower t represent the respective upper and lower boundary values of the uncertainty interval of model predictions for the t th day n is the number of days and r obs t is the measured nitrate concentration on the t th day the larger the puci the higher the confidence in the 95 prediction uncertainty interval limits as being representative of the model prediction uncertainty i e both total prediction uncertainty and parametric prediction uncertainty were assessed using this method the above criteria have proven to be informative in evaluating the uncertainty of model predictions in previous studies jin et al 2010 jiang et al 2015 li et al 2011 3 results 3 1 streamflow simulation the streamflow dynamics evident in gauging station data are well represented by the hype model with nse 0 70 fig 2 table 3 the water balances are also relatively well captured with the largest pbias of 11 6 reflecting underestimation at hausneindorf during 1st nov 2010 31st oct 2013 underestimation of peak flows in extraordinary storm events in january 2011 is noted fig 2 this can be explained in part by the uncertainty of rainfall data whereby rainfall stations are sparsely distributed relative to changes in topography which causes high spatial variability in rainfall woodward et al 2017 moreover peak streamflow events are typically the result of short term intensive rainfall occurring at sub daily time scales and these are difficult to capture using a daily rainfall runoff model jiang et al 2014 lam et al 2012 woodward et al 2017 there is a small decline of model performance during 1st nov 2013 31st oct 2015 relative to 1st nov 2010 31st oct 2013 as reflected by a decrease in nse and increases in pbias and rsr table 3 this may be explained by considering that the hydrological conditions of these two periods are different in that the later period is drier a number of modelling studies have shown that hydrological parameters are not always temporally stable and their values depend greatly on the length and physio climatic conditions of the calibration period e g merz et al 2009 razavi and tolson 2013 patil and stieglitz 2015 the relatively robust model performance in terms of streamflow for the entire simulation period indicates that the model structure and parameter set are sound and transferable between different meteorological and therefore hydrological conditions 3 2 calibration of nitrogen export process parameters the sensitivity of nitrogen export process parameters was tested by determining changes in simulated stream nitrate concentrations relative to changes in each parameter value in application of pest for sensitivity analysis the overall sensitivity of each parameter was assessed by the magnitude of the respective vector of the jacobian matrix which contains derivatives of simulated nitrate concentrations with respect to parameter change based on sensitivity analysis using the daily nitrate dataset the calibrated parameters are listed in order of most to least sensitive uptsoil102 fertdays denitr uptsoil107 uptsoil108 rivvel2 wprodn and denitw this is a similar order to that derived from sensitivity analysis using the fortnightly nitrate dataset parameters rivvel2 and denitw are reversed in their order when the fortnightly dataset was adopted as uptsoil102 is the most sensitive parameter this suggests that plant uptake in agricultural land is an important process controlling the nitrate balance within hype simulations the parameters fertdays and denitr which designate fertilizer applications and denitrification within the soil respectively are also very sensitive as expected except for the parameter uptsoil107 the maximum likelihood parameter values derived from calibration using fortnightly and daily datasets were similar however the posterior parameter distributions derived from calibration using fortnightly and daily nitrate datasets quantified in terms of average parameter values and standard deviations table 2 were decidedly different specifically the daily nitrate dataset produced much narrower posterior parameter uncertainty intervals relative to the fortnightly nitrate dataset as indicated by standard deviations that were lower by more than an order of magnitude except for denitr table 2 that is it appears from these results that application of the daily dataset improved significantly the confidence in nitrogen export process parameters 3 3 nitrate export simulation seasonal stream nitrate variations are characterized by high winter concentrations and low summer concentrations fig 3 the dynamics and overall nitrate balance were well captured at upland stations silberhuette and meisdorf following calibration to either daily or fortnightly nitrate datasets with the lowest nse equal to 0 43 and the largest pbias equal to 17 3 table 4 nitrate concentrations in the stream remain high during high flow conditions in winter this is attributable to the following processes a nitrate contained in soil and groundwater stores is flushed by higher rates of subsurface flow b plant uptake is rather low the average simulated uptake rate was lowest on average during january due to low temperature and almost no agricultural activity conversely nitrate concentrations in summer are low because a lower runoff leads to longer retention times within the catchment stream discharge was lowest on average during august which creates reduced rates of nutrient discharge to streams as nutrient storage levels build in the catchment and subsurface nitrate losses occur prior to discharge to streams and b higher temperatures and more intensive agricultural activities increase biogeochemical activity leading to enhanced plant uptake the monthly average uptake was highest in june the dominant influence of subsurface flow on nitrate export and the strong effect of temperature on nitrate seasonal variability were also reported by shrestha et al 2007 from their nitrate export modelling study of weida catchment central germany the underestimation of nitrate concentrations in high flow events at upland sites is perhaps caused partly by the underestimation of runoff and the associated flushing of nutrients from the subsurface although there may also be enhanced subsurface contributions to stream nitrate loads that are not well captured by the simple representation of aquifers in hype at hausneindorf nitrate variability is lower than at the upland stations silberhuette meisdorf a declining trend in nitrate concentrations was observed at the lowland station hausneindorf whereby the average measured nitrate concentration was 3 28 mg l in the calibration period and 1 28 mg l in the validation period there is some evidence of overestimation of nitrate concentrations during low flow conditions in summer that is probably attributable to the omission of denitrification in deep groundwater flow in the current model and measurement errors knowledge gaps related to nutrient sources at silberhuette model performance in terms of nitrate concentrations using parameters calibrated against the daily nitrate dataset is almost consistently better than that obtained from calibration against the fortnightly nitrate dataset except for the slightly larger bias during the validation period table 4 at meisdorf and hausneindorf the daily nitrate dataset outperformed the fortnightly nitrate dataset for both calibration and validation periods as shown by the higher nse and lower pbias mae and rsr this indicates that nitrogen export process parameters calibrated using the daily nitrate dataset better represent nitrate dynamics occurring at a daily resolution relative to the parameters obtained from calibration to fortnightly nitrate sampling whereas the abovementioned analysis of the daily and fortnightly datasets relied on comparison of daily predictions and measurements the performance of both the daily calibrated and fortnightly calibrated models using fortnightly model outputs and measurements was also evaluated this was aimed at testing whether the fortnightly calibrated model better simulated fortnightly measurements relative to the daily calibrated model i e to evaluate whether the time step of calibration controls which measurement frequency daily or fortnightly is best reproduced by the model the results are given only in summary for brevity the results indicate that the daily calibrated model better reproduces fortnightly measurements relative to the fortnightly calibrated model this is demonstrated by nse values closer to one and pbias values closer to zero for the daily calibrated model for all stations specifically values in brackets are for fortnightly calibrated and daily calibrated models respectively at silberhuette nse 0 56 0 67 and pbias 26 4 12 5 at meisdorf nse 0 41 0 47 and pbias 18 6 0 34 and at hausneindorf nse 0 98 0 50 and pbias 15 0 5 0 the good reproduction of seasonal dynamics of streamflow and nitrate concentrations leads to daily nitrate loads that are reasonably well captured by the daily calibrated model fig 4 the underestimation of daily nitrate loads during storm flow events is the combined result of the underestimation of streamflow and the underestimation of nitrate concentrations as described earlier see figs 2 and 3 daily nitrate loads are overestimated during low flow conditions especially at hausneindorf where the model overestimates nitrate concentrations although the influence on annual nitrate loads is limited given the small contribution of low flow conditions to annual loads calibration against measured nitrate loads i e the product of measured streamflow and nitrate concentration would likely improve load estimates obtained from hype however the focus here is on nitrate concentrations rather than loads so we prefer not to increase errors in reproducing streamflow or nitrate concentrations by adding nitrate loads to the calibration objective function in any case hype captures the temporal and spatial variability of daily nitrate loads satisfactorily using parameters calibrated against either daily or fortnightly nitrate datasets as demonstrated through the calibration and validation statistics given in table 4 the spatial variations in predicted area averaged nitrate loads 2010 2015 from calibration using fortnightly or daily nitrate data are similar characterized by generally higher loads in lowland agricultural sub basins and lower loads in upland forest sub basins fig 5 annual nitrate yields are not only controlled by land use but are also highly dependent on hydrological regimes for example low nitrate loads are observed in some first order lowland agricultural sub basins this is attributable to relatively smaller rates of runoff which is a consequence of the shallow slope of the land surface and the lower rainfall of lowland areas also subsurface fluxes of nutrients are reduced by the low soil permeability chernozems conversely relatively higher loads in upland forest sub basins arise where the runoff is higher due to steeper slopes and where there is higher permeability in the upland soils cambisols leading to shorter retention times and enhanced transport of nitrate to streams the variability in annual nitrate loads obtained from hype are within reasonable ranges compared to that obtained from nitrate export modelling studies of catchments with similar meteorological hydrological and land use patterns for example our nitrate loads fall in the range of 0 15 21 99 kg ha yr while ahmad et al 2011 and rode et al 2009 obtained ranges of a similar order namely 0 84 4 98 kg ha yr and 18 5 41 2 kg ha yr respectively for catchments with comparable characteristics to the selke catchment 3 4 uncertainty in nitrate concentration predictions the time averaged parametric prediction uncertainty interval and total prediction uncertainty interval of nitrate concentrations over the calibration period at silberhuette obtained from calibration using the fortnightly dataset are 1 40 0 23 mg l and 1 40 1 95 mg l respectively the values reflect the time averaged predicted nitrate concentration plus minus half of the difference between the upper and lower limits of time averaged nitrate predictions in comparison the corresponding time averaged uncertainty intervals obtained from calibration using the daily dataset are 1 49 0 056 mg l and 1 49 1 80 mg l respectively at meisdorf the time averaged uncertainty intervals obtained from calibration using the daily dataset are 1 56 0 058 mg l parametric prediction uncertainty and 1 56 1 80 mg l total prediction uncertainty while corresponding values of 1 37 0 24 mg l and 1 37 1 95 mg l were obtained from calibration using the fortnightly dataset at hausneindorf the daily dataset led to corresponding time averaged uncertainty intervals of 3 26 0 090 mg l and 3 26 1 80 mg l while 3 26 0 40 mg l and 3 26 1 98 mg l were obtained from calibration to fortnightly data the calibration results indicate that increasing the measurement frequency from fortnightly to daily also led to a four fold reduction in the posterior parameter uncertainty table 2 however in both the daily and fortnightly models the parametric prediction uncertainty intervals are only a small proportion 3 daily models and 12 fortnightly models at both silberhuette and meisdorf and 5 daily models and 20 fortnightly models at hausneindorf of the total prediction uncertainty intervals the small contribution of parametric prediction uncertainty to total prediction uncertainty is also reflected by the much lower aril for both calibrated models using the alternative measurement frequencies fig 6 and table 5 changing from fortnightly to daily calibration datasets produced only a modest lowering of the total prediction uncertainty which was almost entirely attributable to the reduction in the posterior parameter uncertainty thus the residual error was only slightly modified by the change to the calibration data frequency with residual error in the model calibrated to daily data slight larger 9 at silberhuette and meisdorf and 15 at hausneindorf than that of the model calibrated to fortnightly data inferences can be drawn from the finding that residual error is largely unmodified between the two calibration cases for example it is likely that the 14 fold increase approximately in calibration data between the fortnightly to daily calibrated models introduces larger measurement errors into the estimation of total prediction uncertainty and an increase in residual error is a logical outcome of this if the small increase in residual error is entirely the result of measurement error then measurement errors are themselves rather small given the approximately 14 fold increase in the dataset size this presumes that model structural error remains unchanged between the two calibration attempts given that the vast majority of the model design is identical in both calibration attempts this presumption seems plausible if we speculate based on these results that measurement error is indeed small it infers that the model structural error is considerable because it would consequently account for the majority of the total prediction uncertainty given that parametric prediction uncertainty is also modest as calibration using daily nitrate dataset results in decreased posterior parameter uncertainty table 2 and predictive uncertainty fig 6 and table 5 we take from this that daily stream nitrate measurements enhance the confidence of predicted nitrate export the assertions made here that total nitrate predictive uncertainty is mainly attributed to the combination of model structural error and measurement errors in our case is consistent with findings from previous studies e g balin et al 2010 jiang et al 2015 wellen et al 2014 woodward et al 2017 yang et al 2007 about 25 and 8 1 of nitrate measurements are contained within the 95 parametric prediction uncertainty intervals as derived from calibration using fortnightly and daily nitrate datasets respectively the 95 total prediction uncertainty intervals capture 100 and 97 3 of nitrate measurements for models calibrated to fortnightly and daily nitrate datasets respectively indicating that both nitrate datasets produce reliable total prediction uncertainty intervals the puci estimated from calibration to daily nitrate dataset was much larger than that obtained from calibration using the fortnightly nitrate dataset in terms of both parametric prediction uncertainty intervals and total prediction uncertainty intervals table 5 this suggests that daily nitrate measurements are more informative to the calibration process and subsequently offer greater constraints on nitrate transport and transformation parameters used in hype consequently the daily nitrate dataset is more likely to produce unique parameters 4 discussion the uncertainty analysis results highlight that regardless of the frequency of calibration data residual errors model structural error and measurement error dominate the uncertainty of the hype predictions of nitrate concentrations and loads calibration aims to reduce other uncertainty sources and hence the primary source of uncertainty within our modelling framework is immutable to calibration given that the alternative measurement frequencies considered in this study translate to model modifications via calibration it seems probable that changing the measurement frequency is unlikely to affect model performance in a major way indeed the greater number of measurements within the higher frequency dataset may lead to increased measurement error depending on several complicating factors in our case the residual error increased only slightly with the reduction in the measurement frequency woodward et al 2017 obtained similar findings from their nutrient modelling study of the weida catchment germany they compared daily and monthly calibrations datasets spanning a four year period and found that monthly nitrate sampling provided sufficient information for the calibration of their low spatial resolution catchment model streamgem they evaluated sources of uncertainty using similar methods to those implemented here and found consistent with our results that model structure and measurement error dominate total prediction uncertainty however they did not assess the impact of nitrate measurement frequencies on the posterior parameter uncertainty of their parsimonious catchment model they were unable to separate measurement error and model structural error within the total prediction uncertainty i e the same limitation of our method despite the dominant role of residual error in the total prediction uncertainty calibration using daily nitrate data reduced total prediction uncertainty relative to fortnightly sampling table 2 table 5 and fig 6 albeit to a modest degree while model reliability was only marginally better following calibration to the higher frequency data significant reductions in parametric prediction uncertainty were achieved thus the key advantage of the higher frequency data was that higher confidence was instilled in the model parameters arising from the improved calibration of nitrogen export process parameters in practical terms this means that the nitrate transport and transformation processes can be investigated with higher certainty and the model is expected to provide useful assistance in refining the model to improve model structure and to guide the parameterization of nutrient inputs while residual error dominated total prediction uncertainty and inhibited the benefit of raising the frequency of calibration data in our case we expect that the total predictive uncertainty of models with smaller residual error lower model structural error and or measurement error will be reduced more significantly from higher frequency water quality monitoring there are several options for reducing the structural error in the current hype model for instance denitrification could be added to the deep groundwater flow to account for the nitrate losses and attenuation in nitrate inputs that occur within longer subsurface flow paths prior to the base flow discharge of groundwater to streams additional sampling of the groundwater chemistry and heads would also assist in understanding nitrate processes in the subsurface and the groundwater impacts on stream nitrate concentrations more generally other advancements to the hype model are also possible for reducing structural error for example the simulation of in stream biogeochemical processes could be modified to better account for the effects of flow velocity sediment properties and light availability etc higher resolution nitrate monitoring in stream networks enables the temporal and spatial variability in nitrate transformations in response to changes in climatic hydrological conditions and biogeochemical activities to be captured higher resolution inputs to watershed nitrate export models allows for improved parameterization of in stream biogeochemical processes and nutrient uptake and exchange rates additionally the importance of nutrient retention in estimating nutrient loads at the catchment scale has been demonstrated in previous investigations e g grizzetti et al 2003 our investigation would benefit from further efforts to match nutrient storage levels to field measurements of nutrient mass in the various hydrological components of the selke catchment the model s structure could also be modified to create greater temporal and spatial flexibility within the calibration process such that parameters that are presently fixed in time and or space are discretized to finer resolutions for example some parameters in hype e g uptsoil1 denitr that are presently constant in time could be at least seasonally variable the benefits of adopting temporally variable rather than time invariant parameters to account for variability in nutrient processes and hydrological controls has been demonstrated in previous rainfall runoff and nutrient export investigations e g kim 2016 vandenberghe et al 2007 viswanathan et al 2016 however temporal variability is difficult to justify for some parameters both from the perspective of physical process understanding and in terms of the availability of field data to constrain temporal parameter trends higher resolution nitrate data may allow for the estimation of temporally variable parameters e g between low and high flow conditions thereby reducing errors in process based watershed nutrient export modelling that arise from the assumption of parameter time invariance this may address the problem that arises from lower frequency water quality monitoring in that short period flow events that produce the greatest nutrient fluxes are poorly resolved rode et al 2016b the evaluation of model uncertainty has direct consequences for catchment management strategies that focus on nutrient transport for example the benefit of daily sampling depends on the availability of high quality field monitoring that impart small measurement errors on the calibration effort knowledge of high frequency nutrient behavior also allows for greater understanding of catchment processes leading to model designs that better represent the key factors that impact nutrient concentrations and loads and thereby lowering the model structural error also the results of this investigation offer useful insights into catchment nutrient behavior e g the spatial and temporal variability in nutrient fluxes assessment of the nutrient balance for the study area etc for the purposes of managing human activities of this region in order to develop guidance on water quality monitoring for the current study area and in extending the findings to other regions the results of this investigation need to incorporate other sources of information for example the design of water quality monitoring programs in terms of selecting appropriate monitoring parameters sampling sites and sampling frequencies is dependent on the monitoring objectives budgetary constraints and field dependent characteristics e g catchment size land use episodicity of rainfall etc strobl et al 2006 that influence the need to capture short term fluctuations and extremes indeed according to the review of existing water quality monitoring strategies by behmel et al 2016 there is no holistic solution or guidance that covers all aspects of water quality monitoring programs nevertheless the current study offers helpful insights to assist practitioners in selecting an appropriate temporal resolution of nitrate monitoring for example we show that fortnightly sampling of stream nitrate concentrations may be sufficient for credible calibration of nitrogen export process parameters and satisfactory simulation of nitrate loads alternatively daily sampling may be necessary to improve the confidence in calibration of nitrogen export process parameters and to decrease parametric and overall prediction uncertainty of stream nitrate concentrations while the choice of monitoring frequency will depend on several factors e g measurement accuracy modelling objectives knowledge of nutrient transport processes etc as discussed above in catchments similar to selke fortnightly sampling appears to be adequate for the calibration of semi distributed models such as hype if assessment of model uncertainty is not key to the aims of model development otherwise daily monitoring data are preferred for attaining defensible and robust model parameters that more likely produce reasonable future predictions of catchment behavior in addition to the modelling outcomes the methodology adopted in our investigation in the form of combined application of dream and hype provides a useful and novel example of uncertainty evaluation of a nitrate export model we contend that the methodology adopted here offers a blueprint for investigating other catchments where the role of chemical measurement frequency or other aspects of model development are of interest while there is an unavoidable element of localization in the uncertainty findings it would be arguably less convincing to attempt to draw the same conclusions from a synthetic example or to use non specific theoretical constructs in developing knowledge of the effects of sampling frequency on model uncertainty the current research uses a real world example to provide the first attempt at assessing in a comprehensive manner model uncertainty accompanying alternative temporal resolutions of sampling we anticipate that others will report their findings regarding sampling frequency for different catchments and modelling methodologies over time thereby building on our initial efforts to provide guidance on hydrochemical sampling frequency perhaps future research can attempt to assess nutrient behavior at the catchment scale based on calibration to sub daily water quality monitoring this may assist in advancing the current understanding of nutrient transport processes although the current findings indicate that the application of sub daily measurements would require lower model structural error this is beyond the capability of the current model and the scope of this study other opportunities to extend the current study include the application of alternative uncertainty analysis strategies aimed at identifying the relative contributions of individual modelling components to nitrate export uncertainty this could assist in determining which model structures should be modified to create lower model structural error to confirm or otherwise our conjecture that residual errors are most likely dominated by model structural errors rather than measurement errors within the total prediction uncertainty of the current modelling effort 5 conclusions fortnightly and daily stream nitrate measurements are compared in terms of their utility as calibration datasets in the simulation of nitrate export from a heterogeneous mesoscale catchment selke in germany comparisons are provided in terms of posterior parameter uncertainty of nitrogen export process parameters calibration mismatch parametric prediction uncertainty residual errors and total prediction uncertainty to this end the dream code proved effective for the calibration and uncertainty analysis of a process oriented catchment hydrological model hype results show that calibrated nitrogen export process parameter values using fortnightly and daily nitrate datasets are similar although calibration using daily nitrate dataset generates much narrower posterior parameter uncertainty intervals thus higher resolution nutrient data led to greater confidence in model parameters the dynamics of daily stream nitrate concentrations and nitrate loads are captured satisfactorily at forest dominated upland sub basins without significant differences in model performance obtained from calibration using fortnightly and daily nitrate datasets this suggests that fortnightly nitrate sampling provides sufficient measurements for calibration of nitrogen export process parameters in regions of the model where agriculture is less intense resulting in satisfactory simulation of nitrate export in forested catchments calibration using the daily nitrate dataset better represented fortnightly nitrate measurements relative to calibration using fortnightly nitrate sampling and thus the daily nitrate dataset has instilled better process representation in the model mismatches in simulation of nitrate concentrations during low flow conditions and at lowland agricultural sub basin are noted this is attributed primarily to model structural errors such as a insufficient denitrification in deep groundwater flow b over simplification of in stream biogeochemical processes and c measurement errors in diffuse and point nutrient sources the daily nitrate dataset produced significantly smaller parametric prediction uncertainty but as this is only a small proportion of total prediction uncertainty the higher frequency dataset led to only modest reduction in total prediction uncertainty this study concludes that changing nitrate measurement frequency did not have a significant effect on the reproduction of observed stream nitrate dynamics and the total uncertainty of nitrate predictions more generally because the combination of model structural error and measurement errors were much higher relative to parametric prediction uncertainty however increasing measurement frequency could more significantly affect the accuracy of nitrate export simulation if the measurement errors are reduced and more advanced model structures are developed and utilized in the future acknowledgments this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china 41877487 41501531 natural

6747,the time that rainfall takes to reach the outlet of a catchment as discharge transit time is a fundamental and integrated measure of catchment hydrological processes and solute transport mechanisms as such many efforts have been dedicated to its understanding and quantification however defining and ranking which factors internal and external to the system control the distributions of transit time is still an open challenge here we develop a two stage approach to explore climate and topography controls on transit time using a fully distributed hydrological model coupled with a transport component specifically we apply the model to two synthetic topographies under five observed climate regimes with this setup water fluxes from two years of daily rainfall events are singularly tracked across the catchments to then derive the distributions of transit time and fraction of young water for each combination of topography and climate results highlight a considerable variability of transit times in all climates and a pronounced effect of topography within a given climate they further reveal that for wet climates it is possible to define a curve describing water transit time as a function of cumulative discharge that only depends on topographic properties on the contrary in dry climates the variability of transit time and young water fraction is much larger and not amenable to a simple summary despite simplifications quantitative model based inferences of transit time distributions are useful to better understand how climate and topography affect catchment functioning keywords transit time distributions young water climate topography distributed hydrological modelling 1 introduction transit time distributions ttds are a fundamental descriptor of the way catchments store mix and release water and solutes kirchner et al 2000 mcdonnell and beven 2014 ttds integrate the diverse transit time and flow path lines that rainfall can take to reach the outlet of a catchment as discharge as such their quantification is relevant to predict water storage and solute transport in hydrologic systems and ultimately tackle water quality problems specifically understanding what controls the temporal variability of ttds is important to gain insights into the ecological and biogeochemical functioning of a catchment and to study problems related to water quality such as cycling of pollutants nutrients and carbon danesh yazdi et al 2016 hrachowitz et al 2016 among the controls on ttds climatic and topographic catchment characteristics play a central role in determining the hydrological dynamics but their complex interactions make it difficult to untangle their impacts based on observations e g birkel soulsby 2015 the purpose of this study is to make use of a numerical modelling framework to study the effect of different climates and topographies on the catchment ttds and specifically to understand if climate or topography have a dominant signature ttds can be defined according to two temporal perspectives the forward ttds fttds indicate the distributions of transit times for a given rainfall parcel entering the catchment whereas the backward ttds bttds stand for the distributions of ages of a water parcel leaving the outlet at a given time benettin et al 2015b in the backward approach the young water fraction fyw i e the fraction of stream water that is younger than a specific threshold age has been recently proposed as a new summary metric to study transit time in contrast to summarizing the response in a mean transit time fyw is less vulnerable to aggregation bias in heterogeneous catchments kirchner 2016a b in addition residence time distributions indicate the distributions of ages of water parcels that have been stored in the catchment a wealth of studies has been dedicated to estimate both types of transit times together with residence times e g ali et al 2014 danesh yazdi et al 2016 sprenger et al 2016 ameli et al 2017 benettin et al 2017 heße et al 2017 and recently also the dynamics and variability of young water fraction jasechko et al 2016 wilusz et al 2017 however considerably less research has investigated in a systematic way the effect of climate and topography on ttd variability maxwell et al 2016 understanding how catchment morphological properties and external meteorological forcing control ttds and fyw remains a challenge and a generalization across different regions is mostly lacking birkel and soulsby 2015 the literature focusing on water transit time is often subdivided according to the methodology in data driven or model driven approaches mccallum et al 2014 in the former approach tracer data are fitted with parametric models that estimate ttds whereas in the latter numerical flow and transport models can directly simulate water transit times and age studies using the data driven approach show that climate and topography have a complex and site specific influence on transit time for example hrachowitz et al 2009 2010 have estimated mean transit times from long term tracer data sets for several catchments in the wet scottish highlands and identified topographic properties such as drainage density and topographic wetness index as the most important controls on hydrological response together with precipitation intensity and percentage of responsive soil cover i e generating overland flow heidbüchel et al 2013 indicated soil storage capacity antecedent moisture conditions and precipitation event characteristics as the main factors controlling mean transit times in two zero order semi arid mountainous catchments in arizona usa specifically clustered and high intensity precipitation produced faster and younger runoff explained by the exceedance of a site specific storage threshold jasechko et al 2016 in their estimation of the fyw for 254 relatively large catchments around the world found no significant correlation with annual rainfall but an inverse correlation with average topographic gradients revealing that young stream water is less prevalent in steep catchments than in lower gradient catchments this study confirmed the important role of topographic characteristics on water transit time which has been also observed in other catchments mcguire et al 2005 broxton et al 2009 tetzlaff et al 2009 muñoz villers et al 2016 recent model driven studies have used storage selection functions rinaldo et al 2015 danesh yazdi et al 2016 benettin et al 2017 or flow tracking e g davies et al 2013 fiori and russo 2013 maxwell et al 2016 heße et al 2017 remondi et al 2018 to estimate ttds numerous studies showed that transit time and stream water age are inversely related to rainfall intensity e g heidbüchel et al 2013 hrachowitz et al 2013 benettin et al 2015a queloz et al 2015 ameli et al 2016 heße et al 2017 wilusz et al 2017 remondi et al 2018 maxwell et al 2016 found that among the major catchments across north america arid systems have less variable residence time distributions and explained this by the deeper water table and fewer points of groundwater exfiltration to the river remondi et al 2018 looked at the temporal and spatial dynamics of ttds for a catchment in wales uk and found that seasonality is a strong statistical predictor of the travel time temporal dynamics in such a wet climate while topographic index mostly affects spatial variability in summary there is evidence that both climate and landscape characteristics play a role in determining ttds but their relative importance has not been assessed in a systematic and comparative study such as that framed here and it cannot be obtained by tracer measurements alone by using observations only confounding factors cannot be isolated as in numerical experiments and often only mean transit time rather than ttds could be derived among landscape characteristics we focus on topography because it is typically known with accuracy and has a direct control on runoff generation and flow routing rodríguez iturbe and valdés 1979 beven 1982 we specifically address the following research questions a what is the effect of two catchments with very different topographies on ttds and fyw b how do different climates influence ttds and fyw in these two catchments c can rescaling ttds with cumulative discharge allow for a unique function across different climates despite a number of simplifying assumptions the study is developed to provide quantitative answers to the above questions through a series of numerical experiments on virtual but plausible catchment topographies an integrated distributed hydrological model coupled with a flow transport module remondi et al 2018 is used for this purpose because it explicitly simulates the temporal and spatial dynamics of hydrological processes and it provides a direct computation of time varying ttds and fyw 2 methods a two stage numerical experiment was designed to simulate the effect of climate and topography on ttds by means of a fully distributed hydrological model coupled with a transport component we selected five locations with considerably different climatic characteristics section 2 1 and for each one we performed numerical experiments with real climatic forcing and virtual topographies to compute ttds and fyw specifically we followed the two stage implementation illustrated in fig 1 1 stage 1 consisted of calibrating the watet water age and tracer efficiency tracking hydrological model remondi et al 2018 to simulate discharge in five real catchments the structure of the watet model is presented in section 2 2 whereas section 2 3 presents the calibration procedure 2 stage 2 consisted of setting up numerical experiments by applying watet to compute ttds and fyw for two virtual catchments with different topographies climatic forcing was obtained from the same observations used for the real catchments soil properties were assigned to be equal for the two catchments and site specific parameters for the groundwater storage were retrieved from those calibrated in stage 1 as explained in section 2 4 2 1 study sites and hydrological data five experimental catchments throughout the northern hemisphere were selected to represent different climates tropical mediterranean semi arid humid prealpine and humid maritime climates and based on data availability to force and test the model these were the hafren hf which is part of the plynlimon catchment in the uk the rietholzbach rhb in switzerland the marshall gulch mg in the usa the upper dalya ud in israel and the rio icacos ri a sub catchment of the luquillo catchment in puerto rico fig 2 for each site topographic characteristics together with necessary meteorological data to run the model and streamflow observations to calibrate it were available the major landscape and climatic characteristics as well as the calibration and simulation periods for the five sites are summarized in table 1 each site is a headwater catchment of relatively small area ranging from 1 54 km2 for mg to 41 8 km2 for ud climate types encompass humid conditions at hf and rhb to semi arid at mg mediterranean at ud and tropical at ri average annual temperatures range between 6 7 c hf and 21 4 c ud and average annual precipitation rates range from 632 mm ud to 4150 mm ri the seasonality of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration is shown in fig 2 the study sites and corresponding data sets have been extensively described in previously published research see

calibrated model parameters for the groundwater storage that are used in this study are from remondi et al 2018 the second study catchment is rietholzbach rhb in north eastern switzerland the experimental catchment is dominated by grass 74 5 while soils are for the most part cambisol 40 7 the region has a temperate humid pre alpine climate with frequent precipitation and a clear seasonal

the site helped us in constraining the model parameters teuling et al 2010 heidbüchel et al 2012 seneviratne et al 2012 fatichi et al 2014 melsen et al 2014 ghasemizade et al 2015 von freyberg et al 2015 hirschi et al 2017 in the calibration phase the third study catchment is the marshall gulch mg located north of tucson in arizona us the catchment covers an area of 1 54 km2 and is part of the santa catalina mountains critical zone observatory elevations range from 2284 to 2634 m a s l with the upper part covered by a conifer oak forest on granite bedrock and the lower half covered by a pine oak woodland on schist the climate is semi arid and it is characterized by seasonal precipitation annual average of 800 mm occurring during the summer north america monsoon july to august and winter storms november to march causing the river to be ephemeral for more details on the site hydrology and data the reader is referred to chorover et al 2011 heidbüchel et al 2012 2013 van der velde et al 2015 and trostle et al 2016 the fourth catchment is the upper dalya ud which is larger than the others with a drainage area of 41 8 km2 the soil in the basin is classified as rendzina with clay in the topsoil the surface is scarcely vegetated with grass which is grazed a mediterranean climate dominates the region with wet winters from october to may and dry and hot summers from june to september peleg et al 2015 we calibrated the hydrological model on dalya catchment over the years 2010 2013 the observed discharge dataset was incomplete and included data approximately from october to may at irregular intervals peleg et al 2015 however most of the rain leading to flows higher than 0 1 m3 s occurred during this period during the period 2010 2013 only 5 7 of hourly discharge data were available for each year on average 16 0 for the daily considering only the months from october to may 15 0 of the hourly and 42 4 of the daily observations were available hourly meteorological data were instead complete over the years 2006 2013 which we selected for the numerical experiments the fifth study catchment drains rio icacos ri and is located in the luquillo mountain in northeast puerto rico this catchment is part of the luquillo critical zone observatory which is supported by the u s national science foundation the catchment is covered with tropical forest and soils are classified as inceptisol an average yearly precipitation of 4150 mm makes ri the wettest catchment considered in this study which is characterized by a fast hydrological response more details on the hydrology of this catchment can be found in other studies white et al 1998 pett ridge et al 2009 kurtz et al 2011 murphy and stallard 2012 murphy et al 2012 dialynas et al 2016 2 2 model structure the coupled hydrological transport model watet water age and tracer efficient tracking was used in this study only a brief description is provided here while a complete documentation is available in remondi et al 2018 watet is a spatially fully distributed hydrological model that simulates water and conservative tracer movement at the catchment scale it can track water from different precipitation events and characterize water transit and residence time distributions in any grid cell of the catchment watet includes the essential components of a process based rainfall runoff model and it is constructed on a mosaic of cells on a regular grid each grid cell is composed by three compartments representing surface soil and groundwater storage watet solves water overland channel and subsurface flow between cells using the kinematic wave approximation the flow of water between the groundwater storage cells follows a non linear storage discharge relationship q gw t a s gw t s gw m a x b eq 1 where s gw represents the groundwater storage and s gw m a x the maximum potential groundwater storage benettin et al 2015a the model was run at the hourly scale with sub hourly computations for the routing and required as input rainfall and potential or actual evapotranspiration rates for the rhb site evapotranspiration time series were obtained from a previous study fatichi et al 2014 and compared well with observations seneviratne et al 2012 whereas for all the other sites we computed potential evapotranspiration pet with the priestley taylor method using wind speed air temperature solar radiation cloud cover humidity data and information about the land cover snow accumulation and snow melt were not simulated by the model the transport component of watet explicitly computes the concentration of a conservative tracer in each cell compartment the tracer is assumed to follow water in a purely advective and non age selective manner i e water is well mixed in each storage compartment i e surface channel soil and groundwater of each cell this assumption proved to yield plausible tracer dynamics at the catchment scale since it is applied at the single grid cell level with relatively small volumes remondi et al 2018 when the model is used to follow the fate of one specific precipitation event or day this precipitation input of interest is introduced in the catchment accompanied by an artificial tracer which is otherwise assumed not to exist anywhere in the catchment storage before and not to be introduced afterwards consequently it is possible to track the tracer concentration variability throughout space and time thus enabling the detection of the path and temporal evolution of the water associated with a given precipitation event remondi et al 2018 this approach allowed to explicitly compute time varying ttds and fyw from model results 2 3 stage 1 model calibration for each site we identified a set of parameters that provided a satisfactory simulation of the observed discharge at the outlet this step was required in order to obtain an adequate representation of the behaviour of the groundwater storage which is then used for the numerical experiment in stage 2 watet uses a total of 14 parameters each one characterized by a physical meaning as listed in table s1 for this reason we assigned literature values to the parameters whenever available this was usually the case for some parameter such as soil depth saturated and residual water contents saturated hydraulic conductivity and manning coefficients parameters that were instead calibrated included the van genuchten parameters the hydraulic conductivity at the soil bedrock interface and all the parameters referring to the groundwater the implications of calibrating the latter parameters are discussed in section 4 3 the calibration procedure was run for each catchment for the period with available hydro climatic data i e hourly outlet discharge precipitation and evapotranspiration rates watet was run for each single catchment over the calibration years reported in table 1 multiple times with 1000 combinations of parameter sets aiming at maximizing the calibration metrics and therefore reproducing the observed hourly discharge the parameter sets were sampled using sobol s quasi random number generator in order to better cover the multi dimensional parameter space with a smaller sample size e g as in pappas et al 2013 subsequently a manual trial and error calibration was also performed to further improve the parameter estimation the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of the hourly discharge was selected as the main metric of performance in addition to evaluating nse we required the calibration to achieve a coefficient of determination r2 higher than 0 6 the hydrological budget to be correctly simulated e g total annual discharge close to observations and all the simulated variables e g amount of groundwater seepage mean basin saturation etc to have physically plausible ranges for the hf catchment the model parameters were retrieved from remondi et al 2018 where a calibration against 15 min discharge and 7 hourly discharge chloride dataset was performed for the other catchments instead no calibration against conservative tracer observation was possible because of the lack of high resolution observations of tracer concentrations both in the precipitation input and discharge output 2 4 stage 2 virtual experiment in stage 2 watet was used to model ttds in two synthetic topographic domains for each of the five climates in order to quantify the respective effect of topography and climate on ttds we chose two synthetic domains instead of natural landscapes in order to maximize the differences in the topographic structure of the two catchments and to avoid the confounding effects of heterogeneity in topographic features that natural catchments typically have the topographies of the two synthetic domains fig 3 were taken from ivanov et al 2008 who simulated their geomorphology using the channel hillslope integrated landscape development child landscape evolution model tucker and bras 2000 tucker et al 2001 the cv domain has shorter converging hillslopes and higher drainage density concave hillslopes while the cx domain has longer diverging hillslopes and low drainage density convex hillslopes for the geomorphology simulation with the child landscape evolution model fluvial erosion was imposed as the dominant process in the cv case and hillslope diffusive processes as soil creep in the cx case the domains cover a wide range of slope magnitudes and hillslope lengths and provide substantially different paths of water redistributions ivanov et al 2008 both domains are squared and with an identical catchment area discretized in a regular grid of 4 km2 composed of 2500 cells of 40 40 m size and an outlet in the southwest corner in order to focus only on climate and topographic controls a sandy loam soil with constant soil depth and grassland cover were assumed to characterize both domains and all five climatic forcings while we are aware that soil texture depth and especially vegetation cover can co vary with climate we intentionally disregarded this variability to focus only on the topographic and climate controls soil depth and land use have indeed been shown to be important for transit times e g bearup et al 2016 sayama mcdonnell 2009 and they may represent confounding factors in the virtual experiment if they differ in each case thus introducing variability in soil and vegetation would make result interpretation much more challenging and studying their effect in isolation would increase in a factorial way the number of scenarios making it impractical however the selected soil texture sandy loam and land use grass cover are a soil type which occurs in any climate hengl et al 2017 and a land use generic enough to be deemed as realistic in all the climate conditions analysed here the groundwater parameters from eq 1 were instead linked to the climate and obtained from the calibration in stage 1 the rationale behind this choice is based on an existing link between groundwater recharge and climate while the link between aquifer geology and climate is expected to be weaker groundwater response is indeed controlled to a first order approximation by its recharge and applying the same groundwater storage and response time for all the case studies would be insufficiently realistic we therefore decided to use site specific groundwater parameters that represent features of transmissivity which are the result of the interplay between climate topography and geological context and assumed that they will hold for the two synthetic domains thus each climate was characterized by a specific parametrization of the groundwater storage applied to both the cv and cx domain fig 1 with this solution we intentionally introduced a simple link between groundwater response and climate disregarding the additional variability related to specific geologic conditions which could modify groundwater transmissivity in each catchment even under the same climate basin scale work has indeed shown that bedrock geology can exert a control on water storage mixing and release e g troch et al 2013 berghuijs and kirchner 2017 pfister et al 2017 this simplified approach however allowed reducing the degrees of freedom and facilitating the interpretation of the results finally we selected for each climate type 8 years of continuous hourly meteorological series table 1 to run the virtual experiments as illustrated in fig 1 the scenarios obtained with the design of the experiment and simplifying assumptions presented above depended only on topography climate and groundwater parametrization which is simply linked to climate this setting allowed comparing the relative importance of these factors for each catchment and climate a total of 10 scenarios we ran the watet model to follow in parallel the fate of all the days with rain each day is tracked separately applying a conservative tracer see remondi et al 2018 for details from the 2nd and 3rd year of the eight years used for the virtual experiment first we spun up the model for multiple years until groundwater storage reached dynamic equilibrium and then we disregarded the 1st year as hydrological spin up period from initial homogenous soil moisture conditions we tracked each day with rain from 2 complete years for at least 5 years following its occurrence e g if it rained the last day of the 3rd year we were still tracking that water for the following 5 years the resulting tracer breakthrough curves from each rainy day allowed retrieving the ttds as seen in remondi et al 2018 and thus comparing ttds among the different catchments and climates we analysed and compared not only ttds but also the relations between probability of leaving the catchment and cumulative discharge since the event the latter representation was inspired from the equivalent steady state ess approximation seen in fiori and russo 2008 and ali et al 2014 in our case however we did not need any assumptions about time invariant flow paths because we directly simulated water transit times this representation has been shown to considerably reduce the spread of the distributions of the probability of water leaving the catchment when compared to the temporal representation in the plynlimon catchment and it was postulated as a possibility to account implicitly for climatic controls remondi et al 2018 finally we estimated the young streamflow fraction fyw for each climate and topography the threshold age to calculate the young water fraction was set to 69 days i e 2 3 months this is a representative threshold for defining young water as computed by kirchner 2016b for a wide range of transit time distributions we computed the young water fraction in the discharge over the two years for which we tracked the daily rain from simulations for this period we knew in fact how much water in the discharge rained in the previous 69 days with the exclusion of the first 68 tracked days 3 results 3 1 model calibration for the five sites we obtained hourly discharge simulations with the performance indices nse ranging from 0 58 to 0 90 and r2 from 0 61 to 0 91 table 2 fig s1 shows the flow duration curves of the observed and simulated discharges model performance for the hourly runoff is low for the ri and mg catchments but stronger consistency appears at daily time scales where short term variations are averaged out the low performance at mg is attributed to a number of concurring processes probably poorly captured in the simulations as mountain block recharge forest interception and occurrence of preferential flows ajami et al 2011 van der velde et al 2015 chang et al 2018 moreover at mg and rhb there is snow precipitation in winter months and consequential snow melt which are not simulated by the model for this reason we excluded winter periods from the computation of the performance indexes in these two catchments to minimize snowmelt influences in the considered months table 2 table s1 reports all the calibrated model parameters whereas table 2 shows the calibrated parameters only for the groundwater compartment which are then used in stage 2 3 2 transit time distributions the ttds for each climatic forcing that resulted from tracking 2 years of precipitation events in the two topographies are summarized in fig 4 each transit time curve is normalized by the total rainfall amount of each day once the part lost through et is subtracted so that all curves should reach one for long times throughout the five climates ttds in the cv domain concave topography generated by fluvial erosion are constantly shorter as suggested by the higher values of the cumulative probabilities of water exit for a given transit time than those in the cx domain convex topography generated by diffusive hillslope erosion with the median transit time being on average between 4 ri and 12 mg shorter in the cv domain than the cx one thus the cv domain with a steeper topography and higher drainage density can indeed transport water faster the difference is not pronounced for short transit times i e a few days indicating that initial responses at the scales of few days are less influenced by catchment topographies but becomes larger in the upper quartile where the morphology of the cx domain slows down long term water transport with longer subsurface paths in wet climates i e humid maritime humid prealpine and tropical both ttds reach a similar final point meaning that each of these three climates produces a similar fraction of water at the outlet at the end of the simulation periods once the respective et amounts are subtracted conversely in drier climates i e semi arid and mediterranean more water reaches the outlet in the cv topography than in the cx one during the five years in the latter domain a non negligible amount of water is still retained as groundwater thus requiring a longer time to reach the outlet this difference can be also observed from a discontinuity in the ttd curves for mg and ud climates where for relatively short times less than 30 50 days water travels faster than in wet catchments even though a large uncertainty due to the variability in the initial conditions and rain intensity is evident across events for longer times the fraction of water leaving the catchments forced with dry climates is increasing at a lower rate than it does in wet catchments and the variability is considerably reduced suggesting a more muted and regular response of the aquifers distributions of exit times are plotted in fig 4 as functions of both transit time and cumulative daily discharge in the first case the spread of the curves variability between rainy events is relevant whereas in the second representation the curves tend to be less variable with the exception of the semiarid and mediterranean climates in these scenarios plotting against the cumulated runoff amount does not reduce significantly the variability which is likely more driven by rainfall intensity and antecedent conditions prior to the rainfall event in both cases the spread of the curves is less affected by the topography than in the temporal representation moreover five years are not enough to transport all the water out of the catchments i e the ttds curves do not reach 100 and there is almost an asymptotic behaviour dictated by the slow release of water from the aquifers this confirms that ttds have long tails and that a small part of the water is released very very slowly the exact rate is a function of the groundwater parametrization and given the model simplifications is highly uncertain half of the tracked rain that becomes discharge i e when the cumulated amount of outflow reaches 50 of the total takes a median time between 18 and 33 days in the cv domain and between 21 and 44 days in the cx domain across the five climates table 3 when ttds are grouped according to the catchment topography rather than the climate we can visually compare the influence of the climatic forcing on the shape of the ttd fig 5 as in fig 4 distributions are plotted against both transit time and cumulative discharge but in this case we focused only on the median of the distributions meaning that we computed for each non exceedance probability its median transit time and cumulative discharge note that in the representation against cumulative discharge the curves reach a different maximum value of cumulative discharge according to the local climate which corresponds to the total discharge leaving the catchment after five years of precipitation events for this reason the curves associated with drier climates reach lower amounts of total discharge the median of the cumulative discharge distributions simulated in the wetter climates tend to collapse toward a unique curve for the two catchment topographies in the same plots one can note that the median distributions for the semiarid and mediterranean climates are instead shifted to the left compared to those of the wetter climates this suggests that less cumulative runoff is necessary to remove the same fraction of water from the catchment through discharge which is also related to the fact that absolute discharge is much smaller in these catchments when plotted against time the distributions are more similar across climate for relatively fast transit times but they diverge for transit times longer than 20 30 days which correspond approximately to the 50th percentile of the distributions this is somewhat different when distributions are plotted against the discharge as for the five climates they only converge for very high values of cumulative discharge 3 3 young water fractions tracking all the daily amounts of precipitation over 2 years in their individual paths to the catchment outlet allows the computation of the young water fraction defined here as the streamflow water younger than 69 days section 2 4 the distribution over the entire period of the resulting young water fraction at the outlet of the two domains for all the climate regimes is shown in fig 6 as expected the young water fraction median is higher in wetter climates we found the highest median fyw in the tropical climate 0 76 and 0 66 for the cv and cx domain respectively followed by the humid maritime 0 73 and 0 63 and the humid prealpine climate 0 69 and 0 59 in contrast drier climates have lower median fyw values respectively 0 66 and 0 61 in the mediterranean and 0 50 and 0 27 in the semiarid climate but with a much larger variability for example the fyw spans almost the entire 0 1 range in the semiarid climate the fraction of young water in the cx domain is constantly lower than the one in the cv domain across all climates the median fyw is generally between 8 and 15 lower in the cx case than in that of the cv domain and fyw becomes 46 lower in the semi arid climate 4 discussion 4 1 climatic controls distributions of water exiting the catchments were analysed as function of time ttds and cumulative discharge in the latter representation the variability of the distributions is strongly dampened in wet climates fig 4 and table 3 this finding expands to several wet climates the results of remondi et al 2018 that showed the same behaviour for the hafren catchment in the cases here the role of climate is completely summarized by discharge and it is possible to define a nearly unique transit time function which is though different for the cv and cx domains fig 5 i e for different topographies in general the resulting rescaled transport functions encapsulate catchment characteristics and are almost identical for climates leading to similar hydrological regimes e g persistence of wet conditions and runoff mostly generated through saturation excess however this behaviour cannot be generalized to the dry climates semiarid and mediterranean which have different distributions also when normalized for discharge therefore the rescaled functions are not completely independent from climatic forcing when the latter induces hydrological processes controlling the response different from the ones of the analyzed wet climates semiarid catchments showed in fact a larger fraction of water leaving the catchment for a given cumulative discharge one should note that this is true however in relative terms since the total amount of precipitation is normalized in the figures by removing the water lost by evapotranspiration in other words semiarid catchments are characterized by less water leaving the catchment as discharge at larger cumulative discharge because either water leaves relatively fast after the precipitation events or very slowly through groundwater water remaining in the soil will be more easily evaporated rather than contributing to discharge later on for wet catchments with pronounced topographic attributes as the one analysed here the use of indexes related to catchment topography and topology of soil distribution could potentially guide in determining the shape of the median cumulative discharge distributions without any considerable influence of climatic conditions this would help to identify a function which could be applied to calculate directly and rapidly the catchment scale transport when discharge data are available the representation of the transit time distributions as a function of transit time shows a much more pronounced signature of the climatic forcing fig 5 in addition the young water fraction also varies with climate fig 6 in the wet climates the modelled median transit time decreases and the young water fraction increases with increasing annual precipitation and thus discharge this can be mainly explained by larger and better connected saturated or nearly saturated areas which characterize humid catchments and make them on average more responsive to precipitation than dry catchments concurrently also the groundwater contribution is more dynamic and variable than in dry catchments not that this is true for relatively steep catchments but it could differ for humid flat catchments where groundwater may be the dominant control of catchment response generally these results are in agreement with experimental studies where tracer data revealed a shorter transit time in wetter regions in which large parts of the catchment are connected and saturated areas expand rapidly following precipitation heidbüchel et al 2013 hrachowitz et al 2013 tetzlaff et al 2014 von freyberg et al 2017 the same relation between wet climates and ttds was also found with other modelling approaches heidbüchel et al 2012 hrachowitz et al 2013 benettin et al 2015a heße et al 2017 wilusz et al 2017 however catchments where groundwater is dominating streamflow response can show low young water contributions even in wet climates and there soil and geology can be more important than climate in shaping ttds e g hrachowitz et al 2009 in dry climate regimes variability in the forward transit time distributions and young water fractions is very high the larger variability as compared to wet regimes may be explained by the fact that with less frequent rainfall and small precipitation events most of the water infiltrates in the soil and is evaporated and just a small fraction reaches the groundwater layer where it may be stored for long times before becoming discharge concurrently on rare occasions storage thresholds are exceeded and fast surface and subsurface flow paths are activated leading to transit times that are comparable to wetter climates but also capable of transporting a much larger proportion of the total long term outflow fig 5 such dynamics have been already described for the marshall gulch catchment used in our study as an example of a semiarid climate by heidbüchel et al 2013 our findings are also coherent with those by rinaldo et al 2011 who associated higher variability of ttds to dry climates and those by botter et al 2010 who explained with numerical simulations that in dry climates the intermittency of rainfall is one of the key factors determining the variability of transit time distributions tetzlaff et al 2014 justified the smaller temporal variance in the ttds of a northern catchment with wet cool climate with the presence of a riparian zone when compared to catchments with drier and or more seasonal climates the riparian zone can act as an isostat where different source waters mix and thus it largely determines the stream water ttd controlling runoff generation and stream water chemistry further investigations on the same catchment by lessels et al 2016 confirm the primary role of the riparian zone especially during warmer months when sources of water are more disconnected looking instead at the residence time distributions maxwell et al 2016 found that catchments with increasing aridity across north america have smaller variance in the residence time distributions due to their deeper and flatter water table this finding is consistent with the lower values of the fractions of young water for the arid climates indeed the fraction of young water is on average expected to be smaller when the contribution from deep groundwater flow characterized by slow flow velocities von freyberg et al 2017 is larger this also agrees with a considerable reduction of the spread of the distributions for long transit times which are fed by a less variable groundwater contribution 4 2 topographic controls topography emerges as a first order control on catchment transit time and flow processes as illustrated in section 3 2 and quantified in table 3 for each of the five climates a markedly different response is obtained when simulations are run for the cv or the cx domain the cv domain which was formed by fluvial erosion has a steeper profile and results in faster transit times this result confirms previous studies where transit times were inferred from isotope data for example mcguire et al 2005 found that transit time increases with flow path length and decreases with flow path gradient in the western cascade mountains of oregon united states studying 55 catchments in northern temperate regions tetzlaff et al 2009 determined shorter transit times in steeper catchments thanks also to distributions of freely draining soils similar results were found for a small mountainous catchment in new mexico united states broxton et al 2009 other analyses were carried out by muñoz villers et al 2016 in a tropical mountain catchment in mexico with comparable results long transit times were related in that case to rounded shapes of catchments with a mean slope similar to that of the cx domain 0 23 in contrast they showed that catchments with elongated forms as the sub catchments in our cv domain had shorter transit times with respect to the discharge age estimated from the backward approach we found consistent higher young water fractions for the cv domain than in the cx domain as shown in section 3 3 these results are coherent with the shorter transit times in the cv domain however they differ from the findings by jasechko et al 2016 who calculated the young water fractions for 254 catchments across europe and north america and found a statistically significant inverse correlation between fyw and the logarithm of the topographic gradient jasechko et al 2016 indicated that steeper catchments have less not more young streamflow than those with gentler slopes the different conclusion may be explained by the catchment areas and range of gradients considered the synthetic catchments in this study have an area of 4 km2 and mean gradient of 0 51 and 0 23 in the cv and cx respectively which are difficult to compare with the catchments considered by jasechko et al 2016 mostly larger than 1000 km2 25th percentile 1753 km2 and median 10 800 km2 as reported by von freyberg et al 2017 and with slope range of 0 0007 to 0 11 moreover the correlation that they computed appears to be largely driven by sites with gradients less than roughly 0 01 as noted by von freyberg et al 2017 it can also suggest that topography role on transit times may be masked by other controls e g variable soil depths and heterogeneous soil properties in natural catchments in this analysis given the two steep catchments we used and the kinematic approximation of watet gravitationally driven surface and sub surface flow paths dominate and thus transit time becomes shorter and young water fraction increases as the slope becomes steeper however it is possible that catchments where topography is less pronounced and exhibit flatter and poorly drained areas an opposite dynamic occurs i e lower transit time and higher young water fraction when gradients decline soulsby et al 2006 laudon et al 2007 tetzlaff et al 2009 4 3 assumptions and limitations the results presented in this study are a systematic comparison of ttds over five different climates and two catchment topographies however since they were obtained through model results some assumptions and limitations are worth further discussion a first set of limitations descend from the calibration procedure of the watet model used in stage 1 first due to the number of required parameters it was infeasible to explore the entire parameter space during the calibration process to overcome this problem we explored 1000 combinations of parameter sets sampled using the efficient sobol s quasi random number generator for a first and robust screening and then we relied on expert manual calibration second observations of conservative solutes e g isotopes or chloride in the rainfall and discharge were too sparse to calibrate the model transport component beyond the hafren catchment remondi et al 2018 only hourly streamflow observations were used in the other catchments these assumptions can increase the uncertainty of the reported results remondi et al 2018 showed that the sensitivity of the resulting ttds to the chosen parameters is on the order of 30 40 for the estimated medians of the ttds the uncertainty is likely of the same order of magnitude or slightly larger for the cases presented here thirdly the groundwater parameters were calibrated using the limited measurements available but their unique identifiability is complex regardless of whether tracer data are used benettin et al 2015a or not kirchner 2006 and can further increase uncertainty on the tail of the distributions the second notable limitation concerns the watet model structure which was developed based on assumptions that are relevant in relation to the presented results the model assumes perfect mixing in each cell of each compartment i e channel surface soil and groundwater without considering preferential flow paths this hypothesis was shown to yield plausible solute dynamics at the catchment scale of the hf catchment when relatively higher spatial resolution small volumes are considered but model simulations remain scale dependent remondi et al 2018 moreover the water flow is described in watet with the kinematic approximation and using a simplified infiltration excess scheme based solely on the saturated hydraulic conductivity this assumption is deemed acceptable for the sake of modelling simplicity and considering parameterization uncertainties but it may partly affect the representation of runoff generation in dry climates where fast overland flow can follow heavy storm events on sealed dry soils or hydrophobic soils this limitation can likely contribute to lower nse and r2 performance indexes in the upper dalya finally the model does not account for snow precipitation and snowmelt adding uncertainty to the transit time of winter precipitation events for the rietholzbach and marshall gulch climates finally our study focuses on two aspects only which are expected to control ttds i e climate and topography and indirectly on groundwater functioning which is linked to climate we further limited our analysis to a homogeneous soil layer with constant depth and a single land use these are important but necessary simplifications to be able to isolate climate and topographic controls while having a simulation that is computationally feasible sub surface permeability and connectivity soil depth bedrock geology and land uses are important determinants of the hydrological response as they influence the hydrological state and its temporal and spatial evolution thus controlling the water storage and the transport velocities at different moisture levels e g sayama mcdonnell 2009 harman et al 2011 heidbüchel et al 2013 ameli et al 2017 heße et al 2017 von freyberg et al 2017 all these additional aspects can but not necessarily increase variability in ttds and could represent the target of future investigations the above mentioned limitations suggest that the values of ttds and fyw we estimate are not necessarily very precise but they can still be considered reliable in comparative terms in such controlled experiments in other words the simulated relative differences between catchment and climate characteristics have to be considered more robust than the specific values 5 summary and conclusions the objective of this study was to quantify the magnitude and variability of transit time distributions and young water fractions across two realistic although synthetic topographic domains and five climate regimes for each case we used a simple fully distributed hydrologic model in order to follow the fate of water of each rainy day for two plus five years in its individual path towards the catchment outlet in such a way we directly compute from the model results the dynamic ttds forward in time and the young water fraction fyw scenarios are designed to sort out the effect of climate and topography on the transport response of the hydrological system i e ttds and fyw for the analysed cases in wet climates the role of climate on transport processes can be mostly summarized through discharge as manifestly evident from the distribution of water leaving the catchment when plotted versus cumulative discharge rather than transit time in this representation the median of the distributions merge to almost a unique function that is defined only by the topographic characteristics of the catchment however also topographic differences are less pronounced in this representation in dry climates the convergence of the median distributions is not observed thus suggesting that the role of climatic variability is more important than that of the topographic controls and that the patterns of ttds are rather complex because the processes governing fast and slow hydrological response are very different the initial response has similar time scales to those of wet climates but with a larger variability associated to rainfall intensity fluctuations and a proportionally larger fraction of total water leaving the catchment for a given runoff magnitude the long term response is instead even slower than that observed for wet catchments and characterized by a less pronounced variability of groundwater outflow this is reflected in a larger range of fyw the median of which however was found to be smaller in the simulated dry climates than in the wet ones topography exhibited an important control on catchment transit time and flow processes the domain with a steeper profile generated by fluvial erosion showed faster transit times and higher young water fractions irrespective of the investigated climates overall this numerical effort of comparative analysis provides useful insights into the complex challenge of quantifying how hydrological response and its drivers govern the processes leading to variability of transit time distributions in various catchments and climates the large observed variability in ttds however prevent major generalizations or extrapolations to other scenarios especially in dry climates nonetheless these insights are a step forward in defining major controls and magnitude of catchment scale transport processes which could only be obtained by numerical simulations to this purpose we foresee a central role of modelling tools like the one presented here or even more process based tools to act as a virtual laboratory to develop and test hypotheses useful to disentangle the central role played by various

6747,the time that rainfall takes to reach the outlet of a catchment as discharge transit time is a fundamental and integrated measure of catchment hydrological processes and solute transport mechanisms as such many efforts have been dedicated to its understanding and quantification however defining and ranking which factors internal and external to the system control the distributions of transit time is still an open challenge here we develop a two stage approach to explore climate and topography controls on transit time using a fully distributed hydrological model coupled with a transport component specifically we apply the model to two synthetic topographies under five observed climate regimes with this setup water fluxes from two years of daily rainfall events are singularly tracked across the catchments to then derive the distributions of transit time and fraction of young water for each combination of topography and climate results highlight a considerable variability of transit times in all climates and a pronounced effect of topography within a given climate they further reveal that for wet climates it is possible to define a curve describing water transit time as a function of cumulative discharge that only depends on topographic properties on the contrary in dry climates the variability of transit time and young water fraction is much larger and not amenable to a simple summary despite simplifications quantitative model based inferences of transit time distributions are useful to better understand how climate and topography affect catchment functioning keywords transit time distributions young water climate topography distributed hydrological modelling 1 introduction transit time distributions ttds are a fundamental descriptor of the way catchments store mix and release water and solutes kirchner et al 2000 mcdonnell and beven 2014 ttds integrate the diverse transit time and flow path lines that rainfall can take to reach the outlet of a catchment as discharge as such their quantification is relevant to predict water storage and solute transport in hydrologic systems and ultimately tackle water quality problems specifically understanding what controls the temporal variability of ttds is important to gain insights into the ecological and biogeochemical functioning of a catchment and to study problems related to water quality such as cycling of pollutants nutrients and carbon danesh yazdi et al 2016 hrachowitz et al 2016 among the controls on ttds climatic and topographic catchment characteristics play a central role in determining the hydrological dynamics but their complex interactions make it difficult to untangle their impacts based on observations e g birkel soulsby 2015 the purpose of this study is to make use of a numerical modelling framework to study the effect of different climates and topographies on the catchment ttds and specifically to understand if climate or topography have a dominant signature ttds can be defined according to two temporal perspectives the forward ttds fttds indicate the distributions of transit times for a given rainfall parcel entering the catchment whereas the backward ttds bttds stand for the distributions of ages of a water parcel leaving the outlet at a given time benettin et al 2015b in the backward approach the young water fraction fyw i e the fraction of stream water that is younger than a specific threshold age has been recently proposed as a new summary metric to study transit time in contrast to summarizing the response in a mean transit time fyw is less vulnerable to aggregation bias in heterogeneous catchments kirchner 2016a b in addition residence time distributions indicate the distributions of ages of water parcels that have been stored in the catchment a wealth of studies has been dedicated to estimate both types of transit times together with residence times e g ali et al 2014 danesh yazdi et al 2016 sprenger et al 2016 ameli et al 2017 benettin et al 2017 heße et al 2017 and recently also the dynamics and variability of young water fraction jasechko et al 2016 wilusz et al 2017 however considerably less research has investigated in a systematic way the effect of climate and topography on ttd variability maxwell et al 2016 understanding how catchment morphological properties and external meteorological forcing control ttds and fyw remains a challenge and a generalization across different regions is mostly lacking birkel and soulsby 2015 the literature focusing on water transit time is often subdivided according to the methodology in data driven or model driven approaches mccallum et al 2014 in the former approach tracer data are fitted with parametric models that estimate ttds whereas in the latter numerical flow and transport models can directly simulate water transit times and age studies using the data driven approach show that climate and topography have a complex and site specific influence on transit time for example hrachowitz et al 2009 2010 have estimated mean transit times from long term tracer data sets for several catchments in the wet scottish highlands and identified topographic properties such as drainage density and topographic wetness index as the most important controls on hydrological response together with precipitation intensity and percentage of responsive soil cover i e generating overland flow heidbüchel et al 2013 indicated soil storage capacity antecedent moisture conditions and precipitation event characteristics as the main factors controlling mean transit times in two zero order semi arid mountainous catchments in arizona usa specifically clustered and high intensity precipitation produced faster and younger runoff explained by the exceedance of a site specific storage threshold jasechko et al 2016 in their estimation of the fyw for 254 relatively large catchments around the world found no significant correlation with annual rainfall but an inverse correlation with average topographic gradients revealing that young stream water is less prevalent in steep catchments than in lower gradient catchments this study confirmed the important role of topographic characteristics on water transit time which has been also observed in other catchments mcguire et al 2005 broxton et al 2009 tetzlaff et al 2009 muñoz villers et al 2016 recent model driven studies have used storage selection functions rinaldo et al 2015 danesh yazdi et al 2016 benettin et al 2017 or flow tracking e g davies et al 2013 fiori and russo 2013 maxwell et al 2016 heße et al 2017 remondi et al 2018 to estimate ttds numerous studies showed that transit time and stream water age are inversely related to rainfall intensity e g heidbüchel et al 2013 hrachowitz et al 2013 benettin et al 2015a queloz et al 2015 ameli et al 2016 heße et al 2017 wilusz et al 2017 remondi et al 2018 maxwell et al 2016 found that among the major catchments across north america arid systems have less variable residence time distributions and explained this by the deeper water table and fewer points of groundwater exfiltration to the river remondi et al 2018 looked at the temporal and spatial dynamics of ttds for a catchment in wales uk and found that seasonality is a strong statistical predictor of the travel time temporal dynamics in such a wet climate while topographic index mostly affects spatial variability in summary there is evidence that both climate and landscape characteristics play a role in determining ttds but their relative importance has not been assessed in a systematic and comparative study such as that framed here and it cannot be obtained by tracer measurements alone by using observations only confounding factors cannot be isolated as in numerical experiments and often only mean transit time rather than ttds could be derived among landscape characteristics we focus on topography because it is typically known with accuracy and has a direct control on runoff generation and flow routing rodríguez iturbe and valdés 1979 beven 1982 we specifically address the following research questions a what is the effect of two catchments with very different topographies on ttds and fyw b how do different climates influence ttds and fyw in these two catchments c can rescaling ttds with cumulative discharge allow for a unique function across different climates despite a number of simplifying assumptions the study is developed to provide quantitative answers to the above questions through a series of numerical experiments on virtual but plausible catchment topographies an integrated distributed hydrological model coupled with a flow transport module remondi et al 2018 is used for this purpose because it explicitly simulates the temporal and spatial dynamics of hydrological processes and it provides a direct computation of time varying ttds and fyw 2 methods a two stage numerical experiment was designed to simulate the effect of climate and topography on ttds by means of a fully distributed hydrological model coupled with a transport component we selected five locations with considerably different climatic characteristics section 2 1 and for each one we performed numerical experiments with real climatic forcing and virtual topographies to compute ttds and fyw specifically we followed the two stage implementation illustrated in fig 1 1 stage 1 consisted of calibrating the watet water age and tracer efficiency tracking hydrological model remondi et al 2018 to simulate discharge in five real catchments the structure of the watet model is presented in section 2 2 whereas section 2 3 presents the calibration procedure 2 stage 2 consisted of setting up numerical experiments by applying watet to compute ttds and fyw for two virtual catchments with different topographies climatic forcing was obtained from the same observations used for the real catchments soil properties were assigned to be equal for the two catchments and site specific parameters for the groundwater storage were retrieved from those calibrated in stage 1 as explained in section 2 4 2 1 study sites and hydrological data five experimental catchments throughout the northern hemisphere were selected to represent different climates tropical mediterranean semi arid humid prealpine and humid maritime

coupled hydrological transport model watet water age and tracer efficient tracking was used in this study only a brief description is provided here while a complete documentation is available in remondi et al 2018 watet is a spatially fully distributed hydrological model that simulates water and conservative tracer movement at the catchment scale it can track water from different precipitation events and characterize water transit and residence time distributions in any grid cell of the catchment watet includes the essential components of a process based rainfall runoff model and it is constructed on a mosaic of cells on a regular grid each grid cell is composed by three compartments representing surface soil and groundwater storage watet solves water overland channel and subsurface flow between cells using the kinematic wave approximation the flow of water between the groundwater storage cells follows a non linear storage discharge relationship q gw t a s gw t s gw m

computes the concentration of a conservative tracer in each cell compartment the tracer is assumed to follow water in a purely advective and non age selective manner i e water is well mixed in each storage compartment i e surface channel soil and groundwater of each cell this assumption proved to yield plausible tracer dynamics at the catchment scale since it is applied at the single grid cell level with relatively small volumes remondi et al 2018 when the model is used to follow the fate of one specific precipitation event or day this precipitation input of interest is introduced in the catchment accompanied by an artificial tracer which is otherwise assumed not to exist anywhere in the catchment storage before and not to be introduced afterwards consequently it is possible to track the tracer concentration variability throughout space and time thus enabling the detection of the path and temporal evolution of the water associated with a given precipitation event remondi et al 2018 this approach allowed to explicitly compute time varying ttds and fyw from model results 2 3 stage 1 model calibration for each site we identified a set of parameters that provided a satisfactory simulation of the observed discharge at the outlet this step was required in order to obtain an adequate representation of the behaviour of the groundwater storage which is then used for the numerical experiment in stage 2 watet uses a total of 14 parameters each one characterized by a physical meaning as listed in table s1 for this reason we assigned literature values to the parameters whenever available this was usually the case for some parameter such as soil depth saturated and residual water contents saturated hydraulic conductivity and manning coefficients parameters that were instead calibrated included the van genuchten parameters the hydraulic conductivity at the soil bedrock interface and all the parameters referring to the groundwater the implications of calibrating the latter parameters are discussed in section 4 3 the calibration procedure was run for each catchment for the period with available hydro climatic data i e hourly outlet discharge precipitation and evapotranspiration rates watet was run for each single catchment over the calibration years reported in table 1 multiple times with 1000 combinations of parameter sets aiming at maximizing the calibration metrics and therefore reproducing the observed hourly discharge the parameter sets were sampled using sobol s quasi random number generator in order to better cover the multi dimensional parameter space with a smaller sample size e g as in pappas et al 2013 subsequently a manual trial and error calibration was also performed to further improve the parameter estimation the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of the hourly discharge was selected as the main metric of performance in addition to evaluating nse we required the calibration to achieve a coefficient of determination r2 higher than 0 6 the hydrological budget to be correctly simulated e g total annual discharge close to observations and all the simulated variables e g amount of groundwater seepage mean basin saturation etc to have physically plausible ranges for the hf catchment the model parameters were retrieved from remondi et al 2018 where a calibration against 15 min discharge and 7 hourly discharge chloride dataset was performed for the other catchments instead no calibration against conservative tracer observation was possible because of the lack of high resolution observations of tracer concentrations both in the precipitation input and discharge output 2 4 stage 2 virtual experiment in stage 2 watet was used to model ttds in two synthetic topographic domains for each of the five climates in order to quantify the respective effect of topography and climate on ttds we chose two synthetic domains instead of natural landscapes in order to maximize the differences in the topographic structure of the two catchments and to avoid the confounding effects of heterogeneity in topographic features that natural catchments typically have the topographies of the two synthetic domains fig 3 were taken from ivanov et al 2008 who simulated their geomorphology using the channel hillslope integrated landscape development child landscape evolution model tucker and bras 2000 tucker et al 2001 the cv domain has shorter converging hillslopes and higher drainage density concave hillslopes while the cx domain has longer diverging hillslopes and low drainage density convex hillslopes for the geomorphology simulation with the child landscape evolution model fluvial erosion was imposed as the dominant process in the cv case and hillslope diffusive processes as soil creep in the cx case the domains cover a wide range of slope magnitudes and hillslope lengths and provide substantially different paths of water redistributions ivanov et al 2008 both domains are squared and with an identical catchment area discretized in a regular grid of 4 km2 composed of 2500 cells of 40 40 m size and an outlet in the southwest corner in order to focus only on climate and topographic controls a sandy loam soil with constant soil depth and grassland cover were assumed to characterize both domains and all five climatic forcings while we are aware that soil texture depth and especially vegetation cover can co vary with climate we intentionally disregarded this variability to focus only on the topographic and climate controls soil depth and land use have indeed been shown to be important for transit times e g bearup et al 2016 sayama mcdonnell 2009 and they may represent confounding factors in the virtual experiment if they differ in each case thus introducing variability in soil and vegetation would make result interpretation much more challenging and studying their effect in isolation would increase in a factorial way the number of scenarios making it impractical however the selected soil texture sandy loam and land use grass cover are a soil type which occurs in any climate hengl et al 2017 and a land use generic enough to be deemed as realistic in all the climate conditions analysed here the groundwater parameters from eq 1 were instead linked to the climate and obtained from the calibration in stage 1 the rationale behind this choice is based on an existing link between groundwater recharge and climate while the link between aquifer geology and climate is expected to be weaker groundwater response is indeed controlled to a first order approximation by its recharge and applying the same groundwater storage and response time for all the case studies would be insufficiently realistic we therefore decided to use site specific groundwater parameters that represent features of transmissivity which are the result of the interplay between climate topography and geological context and assumed that they will hold for the two synthetic domains thus each climate was characterized by a specific parametrization of the groundwater storage applied to both the cv and cx domain fig 1 with this solution we intentionally introduced a simple link between groundwater response and climate disregarding the additional variability related to specific geologic conditions which could modify groundwater transmissivity in each catchment even under the same climate basin scale work has indeed shown that bedrock geology can exert a control on water storage mixing and release e g troch et al 2013 berghuijs and kirchner 2017 pfister et al 2017 this simplified approach however allowed reducing the degrees of freedom and facilitating the interpretation of the results finally we selected for each climate type 8 years of continuous hourly meteorological series table 1 to run the virtual experiments as illustrated in fig 1 the scenarios obtained with the design of the experiment and simplifying assumptions presented above depended only on topography climate and groundwater parametrization which is simply linked to climate this setting allowed comparing the relative importance of these factors for each catchment and climate a total of 10 scenarios we ran the watet model to follow in parallel the fate of all the days with rain each day is tracked separately applying a conservative tracer see remondi et al 2018 for details from the 2nd and 3rd year of the eight years used for the virtual experiment first we spun up the model for multiple years until groundwater storage reached dynamic equilibrium and then we disregarded the 1st year as hydrological spin up period from initial homogenous soil moisture conditions we tracked each day with rain from 2 complete years for at least 5 years following its occurrence e g if it rained the last day of the 3rd year we were still tracking that water for the following 5 years the resulting tracer breakthrough curves from each rainy day allowed retrieving the ttds as seen in remondi et al 2018 and thus comparing ttds among the different catchments and climates we analysed and compared not only ttds but also the relations between probability of leaving the catchment and cumulative discharge since the event the latter representation was inspired from the equivalent steady state ess approximation seen in fiori and russo 2008 and ali et al 2014 in our case however we did not need any assumptions about time invariant flow paths because we directly simulated water transit times this representation has been shown to considerably reduce the spread of the distributions of the probability of water leaving the catchment when compared to the temporal representation in the plynlimon catchment and it was postulated as a possibility to account implicitly for climatic controls remondi et al 2018 finally we estimated the young streamflow fraction fyw for each climate and topography the threshold age to calculate the young water fraction was set to 69 days i e 2 3 months this is a representative threshold for defining young water as computed by kirchner 2016b for a wide range of transit time distributions we computed the young water fraction in the discharge over the two years for which we tracked the daily rain from simulations for this period we knew in fact how much water in the discharge rained in the previous 69 days with the exclusion of the first 68 tracked days 3 results 3 1 model calibration for the five sites we obtained hourly discharge simulations with the performance indices nse ranging from 0 58 to 0 90 and r2 from 0 61 to 0 91 table 2 fig s1 shows the flow duration curves of the observed and simulated discharges model performance for the hourly runoff is low for the ri and mg catchments but stronger consistency appears at daily time scales where short term variations are averaged out the low performance at mg is attributed to a number of concurring processes probably poorly captured in the simulations as mountain block recharge forest interception and occurrence of preferential flows ajami et al 2011 van der velde et al 2015 chang et al 2018 moreover at mg and rhb there is snow precipitation in winter months and consequential snow melt which are not simulated by the model for this reason we excluded winter periods from the computation of the performance indexes in these two catchments to minimize snowmelt influences in the considered months table 2 table s1 reports all the calibrated model parameters whereas table 2 shows the calibrated parameters only for the groundwater compartment which are then used in stage 2 3 2 transit time distributions the ttds for each climatic forcing that resulted from tracking 2 years of precipitation events in the two topographies are summarized in fig 4 each transit time curve is normalized by the total rainfall amount of each day once the part lost through et is subtracted so that all curves should reach one for long times throughout the five climates ttds in the cv domain concave topography generated by fluvial erosion are constantly shorter as suggested by the higher values of the cumulative probabilities of water exit for a given transit time than those in the cx domain convex topography generated by diffusive hillslope erosion with the median transit time being on average between 4 ri and 12 mg shorter in the cv domain than the cx one thus the cv domain with a steeper topography and higher drainage density can indeed transport water faster the difference is not pronounced for short transit times i e a few days indicating that initial responses at the scales of few days are less influenced by catchment topographies but becomes larger in the upper quartile where the morphology of the cx domain slows down long term water transport with longer subsurface paths in wet climates i e humid maritime humid prealpine and tropical both ttds reach a similar final point meaning that each of these three climates produces a similar fraction of water at the outlet at the end of the simulation periods once the respective et amounts are subtracted conversely in drier climates i e semi arid and mediterranean more water reaches the outlet in the cv topography than in the cx one during the five years in the latter domain a non negligible amount of water is still retained as groundwater thus requiring a longer time to reach the outlet this difference can be also observed from a discontinuity in the ttd curves for mg and ud climates where for relatively short times less than 30 50 days water travels faster than in wet catchments even though a large uncertainty due to the variability in the initial conditions and rain intensity is evident across events for longer times the fraction of water leaving the catchments forced with dry climates is increasing at a lower rate than it does in wet catchments and the variability is considerably reduced suggesting a more muted and regular response of the aquifers distributions of exit times are plotted in fig 4 as functions of both transit time and cumulative daily discharge in the first case the spread of the curves variability between rainy events is relevant whereas in the second representation the curves tend to be less variable with the exception of the semiarid and mediterranean climates in these scenarios plotting against the cumulated runoff amount does not reduce significantly the variability which is likely more driven by rainfall intensity and antecedent conditions prior to the rainfall event in both cases the spread of the curves is less affected by the topography than in the temporal representation moreover five years are not enough to transport all the water out of the catchments i e the ttds curves do not reach 100 and there is almost an asymptotic behaviour dictated by the slow release of water from the aquifers this confirms that ttds have long tails and that a small part of the water is released very very slowly the exact rate is a function of the groundwater parametrization and given the model simplifications is highly uncertain half of the tracked rain that becomes discharge i e when the cumulated amount of outflow reaches 50 of the total takes a median time between 18 and 33 days in the cv domain and between 21 and 44 days in the cx domain across the five climates table 3 when ttds are grouped according to the catchment topography rather than the climate we can visually compare the influence of the climatic forcing on the shape of the ttd fig 5 as in fig 4 distributions are plotted against both transit time and cumulative discharge but in this case we focused only on the median of the distributions meaning that we computed for each non exceedance probability its median transit time and cumulative discharge note that in the representation against cumulative discharge the curves reach a different maximum value of cumulative discharge according to the local climate which corresponds to the total discharge leaving the catchment after five years of precipitation events for this reason the curves associated with drier climates reach lower amounts of total discharge the median of the cumulative discharge distributions simulated in the wetter climates tend to collapse toward a unique curve for the two catchment topographies in the same plots one can note that the median distributions for the semiarid and mediterranean climates are instead shifted to the left compared to those of the wetter climates this suggests that less cumulative runoff is necessary to remove the same fraction of water from the catchment through discharge which is also related to the fact that absolute discharge is much smaller in these catchments when plotted against time the distributions are more similar across climate for relatively fast transit times but they diverge for transit times longer than 20 30 days which correspond approximately to the 50th percentile of the distributions this is somewhat different when distributions are plotted against the discharge as for the five climates they only converge for very high values of cumulative discharge 3 3 young water fractions tracking all the daily amounts of precipitation over 2 years in their individual paths to the catchment outlet allows the computation of the young water fraction defined here as the streamflow water younger than 69 days section 2 4 the distribution over the entire period of the resulting young water fraction at the outlet of the two domains for all the climate regimes is shown in fig 6 as expected the young water fraction median is higher in wetter climates we found the highest median fyw in the tropical climate 0 76 and 0 66 for the cv and cx domain respectively followed by the humid maritime 0 73 and 0 63 and the humid prealpine climate 0 69 and 0 59 in contrast drier climates have lower median fyw values respectively 0 66 and 0 61 in the mediterranean and 0 50 and 0 27 in the semiarid climate but with a much larger variability for example the fyw spans almost the entire 0 1 range in the semiarid climate the fraction of young water in the cx domain is constantly lower than the one in the cv domain across all climates the median fyw is generally between 8 and 15 lower in the cx case than in that of the cv domain and fyw becomes 46 lower in the semi arid climate 4 discussion 4 1 climatic controls distributions of water exiting the catchments were analysed as function of time ttds and cumulative discharge in the latter representation the variability of the distributions is strongly dampened in wet climates fig 4 and table 3 this finding expands to several wet climates the results of remondi et al 2018 that showed the same behaviour for the hafren catchment in the cases here the role of climate is completely summarized by discharge and it is possible to define a nearly unique transit time function which is though different for the cv and cx domains fig 5 i e for different topographies in general the resulting rescaled transport functions encapsulate catchment characteristics and are almost identical for climates leading to similar hydrological regimes e g persistence of wet conditions and runoff mostly generated through saturation excess however this behaviour cannot be generalized to the dry climates semiarid and mediterranean which have different distributions also when normalized for discharge therefore the rescaled functions are not completely independent from climatic forcing when the latter induces hydrological processes controlling the response different from the ones of the analyzed wet climates semiarid catchments showed in fact a larger fraction of water leaving the catchment for a given cumulative discharge one should note that this is true however in relative terms since the total amount of precipitation is normalized in the figures by removing the water lost by evapotranspiration in other words semiarid catchments are characterized by less water leaving the catchment as discharge at larger cumulative discharge because either water leaves relatively fast after the precipitation events or very slowly through groundwater water remaining in the soil will be more easily evaporated rather than contributing to discharge later on for wet catchments with pronounced topographic attributes as the one analysed here the use of indexes related to catchment topography and topology of soil distribution could potentially guide in determining the shape of the median cumulative discharge distributions without any considerable influence of climatic conditions this would help to identify a function which could be applied to calculate directly and rapidly the catchment scale transport when discharge data are available the representation of the transit time distributions as a function of transit time shows a much more pronounced signature of the climatic forcing fig 5 in addition the young water fraction also varies with climate fig 6 in the wet climates the modelled median transit time decreases and the young water fraction increases with increasing annual precipitation and thus discharge this can be mainly explained by larger and better connected saturated or nearly saturated areas which characterize humid catchments and make them on average more responsive to precipitation than dry catchments concurrently also the groundwater contribution is more dynamic and variable than in dry catchments not that this is true for relatively steep catchments but it could differ for humid flat catchments where groundwater may be the dominant control of catchment response generally these results are in agreement with experimental studies where tracer data revealed a shorter transit time in wetter regions in which large parts of the catchment are connected and saturated areas expand rapidly following precipitation heidbüchel et al 2013 hrachowitz et al 2013 tetzlaff et al 2014 von freyberg et al 2017 the same relation between wet climates and ttds was also found with other modelling approaches heidbüchel et al 2012 hrachowitz et al 2013 benettin et al 2015a heße et al 2017 wilusz et al 2017 however catchments where groundwater is dominating streamflow response can show low young water contributions even in wet climates and there soil and geology can be more important than climate in shaping ttds e g hrachowitz et al 2009 in dry climate regimes variability in the forward transit time distributions and young water fractions is very high the larger variability as compared to wet regimes may be explained by the fact that with less frequent rainfall and small precipitation events most of the water infiltrates in the soil and is evaporated and just a small fraction reaches the groundwater layer where it may be stored for long times before becoming discharge concurrently on rare occasions storage thresholds are exceeded and fast surface and subsurface flow paths are activated leading to transit times that are comparable to wetter climates but also capable of transporting a much larger proportion of the total long term outflow fig 5 such dynamics have been already described for the marshall gulch catchment used in our study as an example of a semiarid climate by heidbüchel et al 2013 our findings are also coherent with those by rinaldo et al 2011 who associated higher variability of ttds to dry climates and those by botter et al 2010 who explained with numerical simulations that in dry climates the intermittency of rainfall is one of the key factors determining the variability of transit time distributions tetzlaff et al 2014 justified the smaller temporal variance in the ttds of a northern catchment with wet cool climate with the presence of a riparian zone when compared to catchments with drier and or more seasonal climates the riparian zone can act as an isostat where different source waters mix and thus it largely determines the stream water ttd controlling runoff generation and stream water chemistry further investigations on the same catchment by lessels et al 2016 confirm the primary role of the riparian zone especially during warmer months when sources of water are more disconnected looking instead at the residence time distributions maxwell et al 2016 found that catchments with increasing aridity across north america have smaller variance in the residence time distributions due to their deeper and flatter water table this finding is consistent with the lower values of the fractions of young water for the arid climates indeed the fraction of young water is on average expected to be smaller when the contribution from deep groundwater flow characterized by slow flow velocities von freyberg et al 2017 is larger this also agrees with a considerable reduction of the spread of the distributions for long transit times which are fed by a less variable groundwater contribution 4 2 topographic controls topography emerges as a first order control on catchment transit time and flow processes as illustrated in section 3 2 and quantified in table 3 for each of the five climates a markedly different response is obtained when simulations are run for the cv or the cx domain the cv domain which was formed by fluvial erosion has a steeper profile and results in faster transit times this result confirms previous studies where transit times were inferred from isotope data for example mcguire et al 2005 found that transit time increases with flow path length and decreases with flow path gradient in the western cascade mountains of oregon united states studying 55 catchments in northern temperate regions tetzlaff et al 2009 determined shorter transit times in steeper catchments thanks also to distributions of freely draining soils similar results were found for a small mountainous catchment in new mexico united states broxton et al 2009 other analyses were carried out by muñoz villers et al 2016 in a tropical mountain catchment in mexico with comparable results long transit times were related in that case to rounded shapes of catchments with a mean slope similar to that of the cx domain 0 23 in contrast they showed that catchments with elongated forms as the sub catchments in our cv domain had shorter transit times with respect to the discharge age estimated from the backward approach we found consistent higher young water fractions for the cv domain than in the cx domain as shown in section 3 3 these results are coherent with the shorter transit times in the cv domain however they differ from the findings by jasechko et al 2016 who calculated the young water fractions for 254 catchments across europe and north america and found a statistically significant inverse correlation between fyw and the logarithm of the topographic gradient jasechko et al 2016 indicated that steeper catchments have less not more young streamflow than those with gentler slopes the different conclusion may be explained by the catchment areas and range of gradients considered the synthetic catchments in this study have an area of 4 km2 and mean gradient of 0 51 and 0 23 in the cv and cx respectively which are difficult to compare with the catchments considered by jasechko et al 2016 mostly larger than 1000 km2 25th percentile 1753 km2 and median 10 800 km2 as reported by von freyberg et al 2017 and with slope range of 0 0007 to 0 11 moreover the correlation that they computed appears to be largely driven by sites with gradients less than roughly 0 01 as noted by von freyberg et al 2017 it can also suggest that topography role on transit times may be masked by other controls e g variable soil depths and heterogeneous soil properties in natural catchments in this analysis given the two steep catchments we used and the kinematic approximation of watet gravitationally driven surface and sub surface flow paths dominate and thus transit time becomes shorter and young water fraction increases as the slope becomes steeper however it is possible that catchments where topography is less pronounced and exhibit flatter and poorly drained areas an opposite dynamic occurs i e lower transit time and higher young water fraction when gradients decline soulsby et al 2006 laudon et al 2007 tetzlaff et al 2009 4 3 assumptions and limitations the results presented in this study are a systematic comparison of ttds over five different climates and two catchment topographies however since they were obtained through model results some assumptions and limitations are worth further discussion a first set of limitations descend from the calibration procedure of the watet model used in stage 1 first due to the number of required parameters it was infeasible to explore the entire parameter space during the calibration process to overcome this problem we explored 1000 combinations of parameter sets sampled using the efficient sobol s quasi random number generator for a first and robust screening and then we relied on expert manual calibration second observations of conservative solutes e g isotopes or chloride in the rainfall and discharge were too sparse to calibrate the model transport component beyond the hafren catchment remondi et al 2018 only hourly streamflow observations were used in the other catchments these assumptions can increase the uncertainty of the reported results remondi et al 2018 showed that the sensitivity of the resulting ttds to the chosen parameters is on the order of 30 40 for the estimated medians of the ttds the uncertainty is likely of the same order of magnitude or slightly larger for the cases presented here thirdly the groundwater parameters were calibrated using the limited measurements available but their unique identifiability is complex regardless of whether tracer data are used benettin et al 2015a or not kirchner 2006 and can further increase uncertainty on the tail of the distributions the second notable limitation concerns the watet model structure which was developed based on assumptions that are relevant in relation to the presented results the model assumes perfect mixing in each cell of each compartment i e channel surface soil and groundwater without considering preferential flow paths this hypothesis was shown to yield plausible solute dynamics at the catchment scale of the hf catchment when relatively higher spatial resolution small volumes are considered but model simulations remain scale dependent remondi et al 2018 moreover the water flow is described in watet with the kinematic approximation and using a simplified infiltration excess scheme based solely on the saturated hydraulic conductivity this assumption is deemed acceptable for the sake of modelling simplicity and considering parameterization uncertainties but it may partly affect the representation of runoff generation in dry climates where fast overland flow can follow heavy storm events on sealed dry soils or hydrophobic soils this limitation can likely contribute to lower nse and r2 performance indexes in the upper dalya finally the model does not account for snow precipitation and snowmelt adding uncertainty to the transit time of winter precipitation events for the rietholzbach and marshall gulch climates finally our study focuses on two aspects only which are expected to control ttds i e climate and topography and indirectly on groundwater functioning which is linked to climate we further limited our analysis to a homogeneous soil layer with constant depth and a single land use these are important but necessary simplifications to be able to isolate climate and topographic controls while having a simulation that is computationally feasible sub surface permeability and connectivity soil depth bedrock geology and land uses are important determinants of the hydrological response as they influence the hydrological state and its temporal and spatial evolution thus controlling the water storage and the transport velocities at different moisture levels e g sayama mcdonnell 2009 harman et al 2011 heidbüchel et al 2013 ameli et al 2017 heße et al 2017 von freyberg et al 2017 all these additional aspects can but not necessarily increase variability in ttds and could represent the target of future investigations the above mentioned limitations suggest that the values of ttds and fyw we estimate are not necessarily very precise but they can still be considered reliable in comparative terms in such controlled experiments in other words the simulated relative differences between catchment and climate characteristics have to be considered more robust than the specific values 5 summary and conclusions the objective of this study was to quantify the magnitude and variability of transit time distributions and young water fractions across two realistic although synthetic topographic domains and five climate regimes for each case we used a simple fully distributed hydrologic model in order to follow the fate of water of each rainy day for two plus five years in its individual path towards the catchment outlet in such a way we directly compute from the model results the dynamic ttds forward in time and the young water fraction fyw scenarios are designed to sort out the effect of climate and topography on the transport response of the hydrological system i e ttds and fyw for the analysed cases in wet climates the role of climate on transport processes can be mostly summarized through discharge as manifestly evident from the distribution of water leaving the catchment when plotted versus cumulative discharge rather than transit time in this representation the median of the distributions merge to almost a unique function that is defined only by the topographic characteristics of the catchment however also topographic differences are less pronounced in this representation in dry climates the convergence of the median distributions is not observed thus suggesting that the role of climatic variability is more important than that of the topographic controls and that the patterns of ttds are rather complex because the processes governing fast and slow hydrological response are very different the initial response has similar time scales to those of wet climates but with a larger variability associated to rainfall intensity fluctuations and a proportionally larger fraction of total water leaving the catchment for a given runoff magnitude the long term response is instead even slower than that observed for wet catchments and characterized by a less pronounced variability of groundwater outflow this is reflected in a larger range of fyw the median of which however was found to be smaller in the simulated dry climates than in the wet ones topography exhibited an important control on catchment transit time and flow processes the domain with a steeper profile generated by fluvial erosion showed faster transit times and higher young water fractions irrespective of the investigated climates overall this numerical effort of comparative analysis provides useful insights into the complex challenge of quantifying how hydrological response and its drivers govern the processes leading to variability of transit time distributions in various catchments and climates the large observed variability in ttds however prevent major generalizations or extrapolations to other scenarios especially in dry climates nonetheless these insights are a step forward in defining major controls and magnitude of catchment scale transport processes which could only be obtained by numerical simulations to this purpose we foresee a central role of modelling tools like the one presented here or even more process based tools to act as a virtual laboratory to develop and test hypotheses useful to disentangle the central role played by various

6748,reducing agricultural runoff year round is important in particular during snowmelt events on landscapes that receive wintertime applications of manure to help inform manure guidelines process level data are needed that link management scenarios with the complexity of snowmelt hence runoff albedo and radiative energy fluxes are strong drivers of thaw but applying these mechanistic measurements across multiple plot scale management treatments over time presents a logistical challenge the objective of this study was to first develop a practical field approach to estimate winter albedo in plot scale field research with multiple management scenarios the second objective was to quantify the radiative drivers of snowmelt by measuring fluxes after wintertime liquid manure application six management treatments were tested in south central wisconsin during the winters of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 with a complete factorial design three manure application timings early december late january and unmanured and two tillage treatments conventional tillage versus no tillage a multiple linear regression model was developed to estimate albedo with digital imagery and readily obtained site characteristics manure timing had a significant effect on radiative energy fluxes and tillage was secondary january applications of liquid manure produced an immediate and lasting decrease in albedo which resulted in greater net radiation absorbed by snowpack and subsequent energy available for snowmelt later applications of liquid manure accelerated snowmelt which increased runoff losses and posed a challenge for nutrient retention from the liquid manure during thaw keywords agriculture manure tillage albedo frozen soil snow energy balance 1 introduction nutrient loading from agricultural runoff is the leading cause of nonpoint source surface water impairment carpenter et al 1998 usepa 2015 and in temperate climates most annual runoff occurs on frozen soils good et al 2012 with greater risk of runoff effective management is particularly important for wintertime land applications of manure a longstanding and essential disposal practice for many dairy producers srinivasan et al 2006 as the sensitive winter season motivates revisions to manure application policy and recommendations e g wi nutrient management standard 590 usda 2015 a need exists for more conclusive data regarding winter runoff processes relative to management decisions srinivasan et al 2006 most agriculture research has been conducted prior to 1980 with limited replication and focused on runoff from solid bedded dairy manures 13 8 55 5 dry matter dm applied at different times during the winter hensler et al 1970 converse et al 1976 klausner et al 1976 young and mutchler 1976 year to year trends were inconsistent but overall early winter applications of manure on bare soil tended to increase runoff compared to late winter applications on top of snowpack and unmanured controls produced the highest runoff volumes hensler et al 1970 converse et al 1976 young and mutchler 1976 the results were attributed to the general complexity of weather and snowmelt as mechanistic data relating the manure practices to winter runoff processes were lacking kongoli and bland 2002 determined the drivers of these runoff trends by measuring energy for snowmelt relative to solid bedded manure 40 50 dm applied on top of snow and unmanured controls as the presence of manure decreased the snow surface albedo from 0 85 to 0 11 the absorption of solar radiation increased in turn the radiant surface temperature of the manure layer rose above freezing and up to seven degrees celsius higher than that of the snowpack in the unmanured control because of the low thermal conductivity of the solid bedded manure range 0 08 0 20 w m 1 k 1 however the absorbed energy was confined to the surface of the manure layer and the underlying snowpack was insulated during thaw events retarding snowmelt through applications on top of snowpack presumably reduced runoff and nutrient losses by increasing the amount of time for infiltration relative to early applications on bare frozen soil though runoff and infiltration were not measured the mulching effect of solid bedded manure which was the predominant form of manure generated at the time may not be applicable to liquid

were also mixed and cited challenges from limited replication of treatments and complex weather and field conditions komiskey et al 2011 few studies have evaluated the winter management of liquid manure applications but recent research that evaluated runoff outcomes provided insight into the current practices of most producers the emphasis for a mechanistic approach to determine environmental conditions that are appropriate for winter spreading remains the high water content of liquid manure likely interacts differently with snowpack than solid bedded manure for example liquid manure may have a greater thermal conductivity and tendency to distribute within snowpack instead of maintaining a thick discrete layer vadas et al 2017 applications of liquid manure on top of snowpack may then accelerate melt by lowering the snow surface albedo and transmitting absorbed energy directly to melt processes even small amounts of impurities such as soot significantly reduce snow surface albedo warren and wiscombe 1985 because radiative fluxes dominate the rate of snowmelt in open systems with relatively shallow snowpack gray and landine 1987 increases in absorbed solar radiation from liquid manure may significantly impact snowmelt dynamics the overall goal of this work was to understand the effect of liquid dairy manure specific to the radiative processes that drive snowmelt in order to mechanistically identify management practices that may reduce or accelerate wintertime losses the need for replication of management treatments paired with the need for repeated physical measurements of albedo and radiative fluxes however requires numerous net radiometers and this is often cost prohibitive the option of moving a few sensors frequently between plots is often impractical due to their fragility and the extreme winter environment satellite data e g modis landsat are also inappropriate for plot scale studies most of the energy reflected by snowpack is within the visible band of the electromagnetic spectrum making digital imagery a strong option for plot scale estimates of albedo corripio 2004 consequently the first objective developed a cost effective and practical field approach to measure albedo within the visible wavelengths for plot scale research with digital imagery and measured snow parameters the second objective was to quantify the radiative fluxes from liquid dairy manure and snowpack using a plot scale approach that allowed for replication of both management treatments and physical measurements of the radiative energy balance 2 materials and

new snowfall 1 mm depth below the measureable limit to thick continuous snowpack layers with or without the presence of manure bare soil was not intended to be represented by this model dates in which the soil had no snow cover were represented with net radiometer data and were not included in the mlr as albedo becomes nonlinear and is a well established function of soil moisture content at values

unmanured control was rated as 1 the december manure application as 2 and the january manure application as 3 tillage was rated as 1 for conventional tillage and 2 for no tillage the presence of manure variable was rated 0 if no manure was visible in the image and 1 if manure was in the image similarly sky condition was rated as 0 for overcast and 1 for clear while digital imagery and surface conditions were captured across all plots on each of the 40 dates only data from the plots that also had direct measurements of albedo with a net radiometer were used to build the mlr i e one plot per date during the freezing season of 2015 2016 and three plots per date during the freezing season of 2016 2017 this procedure yielded a total of 110 ground truthed data points the assumptions of the mlr were tested with the following 1 linearity and transformations were tested with a scatterplot matrix of each explanatory variable and albedo 2 equal variance was tested with residual versus fitted

error of the model by calculating the root mean squared error rmse a final model was determined using the bayesian information criterion bic adjusted r2 radjusted 2 and rmse selection criteria the final mlr model was used to calculate the albedo of all of the plots across the 40 dates in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 to quantify the effect of the manure on resultant solar longwave and net radiation

surface temperature of each treatment in kelvin measured by the infrared radiometers a mean of 0 98 was used for the emissivity ε of snowpack as measured by the net radiometers in this study which is comparable to other established values hewison and english 1999 wan 2008 warren 1982 daily averages of 24 h incoming solar and longwave radiation were calculated and albedo estimates were used to calculate the average daily absorbed solar radiation for each plot which allowed for averages and standard error to be calculated across manure and tillage treatments the data related to longwave radiation including net radiation were restricted to one daily value per treatment because only one replication was instrumented with infrared radiometers for the ground surface temperature measurement 3 results and discussion 3 1 monitoring conditions average air temperature and total precipitation were greater during the winters of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 than the 30 year normal 1981 2010 national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2017 and there were fewer days of frozen ground compared to 10 year averages university of wisconsin 2010 table 1 six thaw events occurred during the 74 days of frozen ground in the 2015 2016 monitoring year and nine thaw events occurred during the 94 days of frozen ground in the second monitoring year fig 1 the 10 december 2015 manure application occurred on unfrozen bare soil as the soil froze 41 days later than average and snow did not accumulate until 31 december 2015 figs 1 and 2 on 26 january 2016 manure was applied on top of

air temperature table 2 each of these eight inputs represent accessible data that are conducive to rapid measurement in applied plot scale research a strong relationship was obtained between observed versus predicted albedo estimates radjusted 2 0 87 fig 3 3 3 tillage and liquid manure application impacts on albedo and snowpack the albedo ranged from 0 08 for thawing soil without snowpack to 0 95 for fresh snow and liquid manure application resulted in a patchy discontinuous layer of manure that infiltrated the underlying snowpack as the 26 january 2016 application took place prior to the mlr development only a net radiometer recorded the change in albedo from 0 95 of the freshly fallen snow from the night before to 0 33 after manure application on no tillage soils between 27 and 29 january the albedo of unmanured snowpack remained above 0 89 whereas the manured plot remained below 0 4 snowmelt began on 30 january and by 1 february 2016 the albedo of the manured plot decreased to 0 12 while the unmanured snowpack decreased to 0 46 the mlr method was added 08 february after there was a clear need to capture abrupt changes in albedo with additional small scale snowfall events and a second thaw event between 02 and 07 february despite there having already been two incomplete melt events post manure application the manure exhibited a legacy effect on albedo through 15 february 2016 because of low and intermittent snowfall a total of 4 mm swe of new snow fell between 27 january 08 february 2016 after which no snowfall occurred until late march figs 1 and 2 increases in albedo from new snow were temporary in the january manured plots as the shallowly buried manure layer remained well within the penetration depth of solar radiation which is estimated to be 10 16 mm swe or a 10 cm snow depth baker et al 1991 o neill and gray 1973 perovich 2007 by 20 february 2016 the next date of digital imagery a large scale snowmelt occurred and all of the snowpack melted after this event the january manured treatments were not different from other manure timings after developing the mlr in late winter 2015 2016 more temporally detailed measurements were completed for the winter of 2016 2017 on 9 december 2016 the manure application decreased the albedo from 0 71 se 0 00 to 0 46 se 0 04 on conventional tillage and 0 69 se 0 01 to 0 39 se 0 04 on no tillage from 10 to 12 december 2016 14 mm swe fell bringing the albedo of all the plots between 0 8 and 0 9 and no additional differences in albedo were estimated from the december application between 24 december 2016 and 10 january 2017 primarily frozen conditions with intermittent rain snow drift and a lack of new snowfall caused overall reductions in snow depth and greater variability between tillage treatments figs 1 and 2 snowpack particularly decreased on conventionally tilled soils as the shallowly buried ridges were within the penetration depth of solar radiation and gradually became exposed during that 18 day period without new snow and 28 mm of rain the albedo of conventional tillage decreased to 0 31 while no tillage decreased to 0 43 new snowfall occurred on 11 january 2017 and became more frequent through the end of the month reducing the differences between tillages on 27 january 2017 the manure application decreased the albedo from 0 73 se 0 02 to 0 45 se 0 04 on conventional tillage and 0 74 se 0 01 to 0 48 on no tillage se 0 01 these decreases are significant and similar to decreases in snow albedo from volcanic ash deposits 0 84 0 36 which were found to accelerate the rate of snowmelt by about 150 young et al 2014 after new snowfall on 31 january swe 1 8 mm all of the treatments had similar albedos as snow aged and additional precipitation included rain e g 1 6 mm of rainfall on 5 february the albedo of the january manure treatment regardless of tillage remained lower than that of other application timings and lasted for three weeks specifically the albedo from the january applications remained 0 51 0 41 lower in conventional tillage and no tillage respectively than plots with no manure or december applications this may be explained by overall site conditions more precipitation fell as snow in december 2016 and masked the december manure layer fig 2 the thickness and duration of any new snow cover on top of the january manure layer was minimized by more precipitation falling as rain in january and february fig 1 as well as the greater intensity of solar irradiance after the winter solstice 3 4 discussion of liquid manure application and tillage on radiative energy and runoff with lasting changes in the estimated albedo differences in the reflected solar radiation hence average daily net radiation became pronounced after the january manure applications across tillage treatments in both winters during winter 2015 16 reflected solar radiation decreased by an average of 50 w m 2 from the january application on no tillage until 01 february 2016 as recorded by net radiometers when a large melt event caused much of the applied manure to runoff new snowfall and subsequent melts reduced these differences for the remainder of that winter as captured by the mlr fig 4 at the onset of the january 2017 application the average daily reflected solar radiation decreased by 36 4 se 3 6 w m 2 in conventional tillage and 35 0 se 1 3 w m 2 in no tillage compared to unmanured controls fig 4c these differences in reflected solar radiation between the january application and control increased during snowmelt events until a maximum average daily difference of 75 8 w m 2 se 6 1 was reached on conventional tillage and 96 2 se 3 1 w m 2 on no tillage in mid february 2017 as a result swe decreased up to 9 and 12 mm d 1 2 5 cm d 1 as snow depth faster from january applications compared to december applications and controls in conventional versus no tillage respectively fig 2 snowpack disappeared up to three days earlier during thaw events effectively reducing the length of the events by half while different in scale the trends are in agreement with those regarding dust deposition on subalpine snowpack as radiative absorption increased by 35 70 w m 2 from dust 600 mm of swe disappeared 51 days earlier than in regions of dust free snow skiles et al 2012 a secondary difference in reflected solar radiation arose from tillage type during the late december 2016 and mid february 2017 the average daily reflected solar radiation from conventional tillage was up to 50 w m 2 lower than no tillage fig 4 this difference is attributed to the network of ridges and furrows created by the fall chisel plow snow tended to be thinner on the ridges allowing the underlying bare soil surface to influence the snow surface albedo and in turn cause the thinner snow to regress during melts therefore the presence of the ridges lowered albedo allowing for greater absorption of solar radiation with conventional tillage under no tillage snowpack was able to form as a deeper continuous layer with a greater albedo unless manure was added in late january the strong contrast in reflected solar radiation between january manure applications and controls was lower in conventional tillage when soil ridges were exposed than in no tillage the average and maximum daily surface temperatures of the plots were not significantly different fig 5 thus differences in outgoing longwave radiation were also not significant the decrease in albedo from solid bedded manure applications can increase the temperature of the manure layer above freezing kongoli and bland 2002 the lack of surface heating from liquid manure however may be attributed to the interaction between the manure and snowpack after liquid manure is applied the manure does not remain as a discrete layer but instead infiltrates into the snow with little residue left at the snow surface creating a mixed snow manure layer with a lowered albedo the thermal conductivity of the liquid manure was 0 62 0 70 w m 1 k 1 or 5 5 times greater than that of the solid bedded manure measured by kongoli and bland 2002 due to the higher water content and potential sand bedding residuals associated with liquid manure systems consequently as the albedo decreased from manure applications the absorbed energy was transmitted to the snowpack instead of being confined to the manure fig 6 the net radiation during thaw events indicated the legacy effect of late january applications of liquid manure on snow albedo regardless of tillage and highlights the risk of accelerating snowmelt and increasing potential nutrient loads in runoff the cumulative net radiation was 5 1 mj m 2 d 1 greater from january applications versus controls or december applications across tillages during the 6 8 february 2017 thaw and 19 mj m 2 d 1 greater during 10 14 february 2017 cumulative across the season on dates in which albedo was measured net radiation was 4 5 mj m 2 d 1 greater with december application compared to unmanured control and 44 0 mj m 2 d 1 greater with january application compared to the control the increases in net radiation and accelerated snowmelt resulted in greater runoff losses from the late january manure application while all wintertime manure additions inherently add risk to runoff losses vadas et al 2017 liquid manure applied in late january intensified surface nutrient transport table 3 the earlier onset of runoff and increase to the total runoff volume caused concentrated nutrient loads during key melt events on frozen soils as a result surface losses of nitrogen and phosphorus doubled on soils with late january applications compared to those with early december this is attributed to the prolonged increase in net radiation from the late january application regardless of new snowfall that infiltrated underlying snowpack and directly transmitted absorbed solar radiation to melt processes changes to the surface energy balance from late applications of liquid manure add further concern to this sensitive time of year by coinciding with environmental conditions that already promote runoff on frozen soils slowed infiltration from greater pore ice development niu and yang 2006 increasing intensity of solar irradiance after the winter solstice increasing air temperature and greater frequency of rain this contrasts the mulching effect from solid bedded manure that allows more time for infiltration by slowing snowmelt thereby reducing some nutrient loss from applications kongoli and bland 2002 therefore wintertime applications of liquid manure and especially those later in the freezing season add risk to nutrient management by accelerating snowmelt which generates additional environmental concerns for runoff as producers move from solid to liquid manure forms 4 conclusion this study monitored the influence of liquid dairy manure application timing early versus later in the freezing season and tillage conventional fall tillage with a chisel plow versus no tillage on the resultant radiative energy fluxes on soils with snowpack first a multiple linear regression model was developed with digital imagery and readily obtained site characteristics to repeatedly estimate plot scale albedo over time after dynamic snow behavior and field operations with these estimates of albedo radiative fluxes were calculated for each management treatment liquid manure applied on top of snow infiltrated the underlying snowpack creating a generally homogenized snow manure layer with a lower albedo while early winter applications of manure did not alter radiative energy fluxes through albedo longer than the day of the application late january applications produced a lasting effect as mixed precipitation and more intense irradiance after the solstice reduced masking of the manure layer the surface roughness from conventional tillage reduced albedo but the effect of tillage on radiative fluxes was secondary to manure application timing late applications of liquid manure ultimately accelerated snowmelt that increased runoff and doubled nutrient loads posing a challenge to nutrient retention on frozen ground conflict of interest none acknowledgements this work was funded by the usda national institute of food and agriculture agriculture and food research initiative

6748,reducing agricultural runoff year round is important in particular during snowmelt events on landscapes that receive wintertime applications of manure to help inform manure guidelines process level data are needed that link management scenarios with the complexity of snowmelt hence runoff albedo and radiative energy fluxes are strong drivers of thaw but applying these mechanistic measurements across multiple plot scale management treatments over time presents a logistical challenge the objective of this study was to first develop a practical field approach to estimate winter albedo in plot scale field research with multiple management scenarios the second objective was to quantify the radiative drivers of snowmelt by measuring fluxes after wintertime liquid manure application six management treatments were tested in south central wisconsin during the winters of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 with a complete factorial design three manure application timings early december late january and unmanured and two tillage treatments conventional tillage versus no tillage a multiple linear regression model was developed to estimate albedo with digital imagery and readily obtained site characteristics manure timing had a significant effect on radiative energy fluxes and tillage was secondary january applications of liquid manure produced an immediate and lasting decrease in albedo which resulted in greater net radiation absorbed by snowpack and subsequent energy available for snowmelt later applications of liquid manure accelerated snowmelt which increased runoff losses and posed a challenge for nutrient retention from the liquid manure during thaw keywords agriculture manure tillage albedo frozen soil snow energy balance 1 introduction nutrient loading from agricultural runoff is the leading cause of nonpoint source surface water impairment carpenter et al 1998 usepa 2015 and in temperate climates most annual runoff occurs on frozen soils good et al 2012 with greater risk of runoff effective management is particularly important for wintertime land applications of manure a longstanding and essential disposal practice for many dairy producers srinivasan et al 2006 as the sensitive winter season motivates revisions to manure application policy and recommendations e g wi nutrient management standard 590 usda 2015 a need exists for more conclusive data regarding winter runoff processes relative to management decisions srinivasan et al 2006 most agriculture research has been conducted prior to 1980 with limited replication and focused on runoff from solid bedded dairy manures 13 8 55 5 dry matter dm applied at different times during the winter hensler et al 1970 converse et al 1976 klausner et al 1976 young and mutchler 1976 year to year trends were inconsistent but overall early winter applications of manure on bare soil tended to increase runoff compared to late winter applications on top of snowpack and unmanured controls produced the highest runoff volumes hensler et al 1970 converse et al 1976 young and mutchler 1976 the results were attributed to the general complexity of weather and snowmelt as mechanistic data relating the manure practices to winter runoff processes were lacking kongoli and bland 2002 determined the drivers of these runoff trends by measuring energy for snowmelt relative to solid bedded manure 40 50 dm applied on top of snow and unmanured controls as the presence of manure decreased the snow surface albedo from 0 85 to 0 11 the absorption of solar radiation increased in turn the radiant surface temperature of the manure layer rose above freezing and up to seven degrees celsius higher than that of the snowpack in the unmanured control because of the low thermal conductivity of the solid bedded manure range 0 08 0 20 w m 1 k 1 however the absorbed energy was confined to the surface of the manure layer and the underlying snowpack was insulated during thaw events retarding snowmelt through applications on top of snowpack presumably reduced runoff and nutrient losses by increasing the amount of time for infiltration relative to early applications on bare frozen soil though runoff and infiltration were not measured the mulching effect of solid bedded manure which was the predominant form of manure generated at the time may not be applicable to liquid manure 11 dm which is now much more common usda nass 2010 in a comparison of winter applied liquid swine manure 4 dm to turkey litter 57 dm overall runoff loads were greater from the liquid manure despite the higher nutrient load within the turkey litter at application owens et al 2011 other comparisons such as wintertime applications of liquid dairy manure to no tillage and disk tillage fields were also mixed and cited challenges from limited replication of treatments and complex weather and field conditions komiskey et al 2011 few studies have evaluated the winter management of liquid manure applications but recent research that evaluated runoff outcomes provided insight into the current practices of most producers the emphasis for a mechanistic approach to determine environmental conditions that are appropriate for winter spreading remains the high water content of liquid manure likely interacts differently with snowpack than solid bedded manure for example liquid manure may have a greater thermal conductivity and tendency to distribute within snowpack instead of maintaining a thick discrete layer vadas et al 2017 applications of liquid manure on top of snowpack may then accelerate melt by lowering the snow surface albedo and transmitting absorbed energy directly to melt processes even small amounts of impurities such as soot significantly reduce snow surface albedo warren and wiscombe 1985 because radiative fluxes dominate the rate of snowmelt in open systems with relatively shallow snowpack gray and landine 1987 increases in absorbed solar radiation from liquid manure may significantly impact snowmelt dynamics the overall goal of this work was to understand the effect of liquid dairy manure specific to the radiative processes that drive snowmelt in order to mechanistically identify management practices that may reduce or accelerate wintertime losses the need for replication of management treatments paired with the need for repeated physical measurements of albedo and radiative fluxes however requires numerous net radiometers and this is often cost prohibitive the option of moving a few sensors frequently between plots is often impractical due to their fragility and the extreme winter environment satellite data e g modis landsat are also inappropriate for plot scale studies most of the energy reflected by snowpack is within the visible band of the electromagnetic spectrum making digital imagery a strong option for plot scale estimates of albedo corripio 2004 consequently the first objective developed a cost effective and practical field approach to measure albedo within the visible wavelengths for plot scale research with digital imagery and measured snow parameters the second objective was to quantify the radiative fluxes from liquid dairy manure and snowpack using a plot scale approach that allowed for replication of both management treatments and physical measurements of the radiative energy balance 2 materials and

inadequate as such a multiple linear regression mlr model of digital imagery surface and weather conditions and known albedo values measured by the net radiometers was developed for 40 dates during

new snowfall 1 mm depth below the measureable limit to thick continuous snowpack layers with or without the presence of manure bare soil was not intended to be represented by this model dates in which the soil had no snow cover were represented with net radiometer data and were not included in the mlr as albedo becomes nonlinear and is a well established function of soil moisture content at values

unmanured control was rated as 1 the december manure application as 2 and the january manure application as 3 tillage was rated as 1 for conventional tillage and 2 for no tillage the presence of manure variable was rated 0 if no manure was visible in the image and 1 if manure was in the image similarly sky condition was rated as 0 for overcast and 1 for clear while digital imagery and surface conditions were captured across all plots on each of the 40 dates only data from the plots that also had direct measurements of albedo with a net radiometer were used to build the mlr i e one plot per date during the freezing season of 2015 2016 and three plots per date during the freezing season of 2016 2017 this procedure yielded a total of 110 ground truthed data points the assumptions of the

error of the model by calculating the root mean squared error rmse a final model was determined using the bayesian information criterion bic adjusted r2 radjusted 2 and rmse selection criteria the final mlr model was used to calculate the albedo of all of the plots across the 40 dates in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 to quantify the effect of the manure on resultant solar longwave and net radiation

surface temperature of each treatment in kelvin measured by the infrared radiometers a mean of 0 98 was used for the emissivity ε of snowpack as measured by the net radiometers in this study which is comparable to other established values hewison and english 1999 wan 2008 warren 1982 daily averages of 24 h incoming solar and longwave radiation were calculated and albedo estimates were used to calculate the average daily absorbed solar radiation for each plot which allowed for averages and standard error to be calculated across manure and tillage treatments the data related to longwave radiation including net radiation were restricted to one daily value per treatment because only one replication was instrumented with infrared radiometers for the ground surface temperature measurement 3 results and discussion 3 1 monitoring conditions average air temperature and total precipitation were greater during the winters of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 than the 30 year normal 1981 2010 national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2017 and there were fewer days of frozen ground compared to 10 year averages university of wisconsin 2010 table 1 six thaw events occurred during the 74 days of frozen ground in the 2015 2016 monitoring year and nine thaw events occurred during the 94 days of frozen ground in the second monitoring year fig 1 the 10 december 2015 manure application occurred on unfrozen bare soil as the soil froze 41 days later than average and snow did not accumulate until 31 december 2015 figs 1 and 2 on 26 january 2016 manure was applied on top of snow that was 15 6 cm deep se 0 6 with a swe of 24 mm se 1 and underlying frozen soil the 9 december 2016 application was on top of snow with an average depth of 6 1 cm se 0 3 swe of 10 mm se 1 and underlying frozen soil the 27 january 2017 application was on top of snow with an average depth of 19 6 cm se 0 4 swe of 31 mm se 1 and underlying frozen soil by 22 feb 2017 the soil thawed after the

versus predicted albedo estimates radjusted 2 0 87 fig 3 3 3 tillage and liquid manure application impacts on albedo and snowpack the albedo ranged from 0 08 for thawing soil without snowpack to 0 95 for fresh snow and liquid manure application resulted in a patchy discontinuous layer of manure that infiltrated the underlying snowpack as the 26 january 2016 application took place prior to the mlr development only a net radiometer recorded the change in albedo from 0 95 of the freshly fallen snow from the night before to 0 33 after manure application on no tillage soils between 27 and 29 january the albedo of unmanured snowpack remained above 0 89 whereas the manured plot remained below 0 4 snowmelt began on 30 january and by 1 february 2016 the albedo of the manured plot decreased to 0 12 while the unmanured snowpack decreased to 0 46 the mlr method was added 08 february after there was a clear need to capture abrupt changes in albedo with additional small scale snowfall events and a second thaw event between 02 and 07 february despite there having already been two incomplete melt events post manure application the manure exhibited a legacy effect on albedo through 15 february 2016 because of low and intermittent snowfall a total of 4 mm swe of new snow fell between 27 january 08 february 2016 after which no snowfall occurred until late march figs 1 and 2 increases in albedo from new snow were temporary in the january manured plots as the shallowly buried manure layer remained well within the penetration depth of solar radiation which is estimated to be 10 16 mm swe or a 10 cm snow depth baker et al 1991 o neill and gray 1973 perovich 2007 by 20 february 2016 the next date of digital imagery a large scale snowmelt occurred and all of the snowpack melted after this event the january manured treatments were not different from other manure timings after developing the mlr in late winter 2015 2016 more temporally detailed measurements were completed for the winter of 2016 2017 on 9 december 2016 the manure application decreased the albedo from 0 71 se 0 00 to 0 46 se 0 04 on conventional tillage and 0 69 se 0 01 to 0 39 se 0 04 on no tillage from 10 to 12 december 2016 14 mm swe fell bringing the albedo of all the plots between 0 8 and 0 9 and no additional differences in albedo were estimated from the december application between 24 december 2016 and 10 january 2017 primarily frozen conditions with intermittent rain snow drift and a lack of new snowfall caused overall reductions in snow depth and greater variability between tillage treatments figs 1 and 2 snowpack particularly decreased on conventionally tilled soils as the shallowly buried ridges were within the penetration depth of solar radiation and gradually became exposed during that 18 day period without new snow and 28 mm of rain the albedo of conventional tillage decreased to 0 31 while no tillage decreased to 0 43 new snowfall occurred on 11 january 2017 and became more frequent through the end of the month reducing the differences between tillages on 27 january 2017 the manure application decreased the albedo from 0 73 se 0 02 to 0 45 se 0 04 on conventional tillage and 0 74 se 0 01 to 0 48 on no tillage se 0 01 these decreases are significant and similar to decreases in snow albedo from volcanic ash deposits 0 84 0 36 which were found to accelerate the rate of snowmelt by about 150 young et al 2014 after new snowfall on 31 january swe 1 8 mm all of the treatments had similar albedos as snow aged and additional precipitation included rain e g 1 6 mm of rainfall on 5 february the albedo of the january manure treatment regardless of tillage remained lower than that of other application timings and lasted for three weeks specifically the albedo from the january applications remained 0 51 0 41 lower in conventional tillage and no tillage respectively than plots with no manure or december applications this may be explained by overall site conditions more precipitation fell as snow in december 2016 and masked the december manure layer fig 2 the thickness and duration of any new snow cover on top of the january manure layer was minimized by more precipitation falling as rain in january and february fig 1 as well as the greater intensity of solar irradiance after the winter solstice 3 4 discussion of liquid manure application and tillage on radiative energy and runoff with lasting changes in the estimated albedo differences in the reflected solar radiation hence average daily net radiation became pronounced after the january manure applications across tillage treatments in both winters during winter 2015 16 reflected solar radiation decreased by an average of 50 w m 2 from the january application on no tillage until 01 february 2016 as recorded by net radiometers when a large melt event caused much of the applied manure to runoff new snowfall and subsequent melts reduced these differences for the remainder of that winter as captured by the mlr fig 4 at the onset of the january 2017 application the average daily reflected solar radiation decreased by 36 4 se 3 6 w m 2 in conventional tillage and 35 0 se 1 3 w m 2 in no tillage compared to unmanured controls fig 4c these differences in reflected solar radiation between the january application and control increased during snowmelt events until a maximum average daily difference of 75 8 w m 2 se 6 1 was reached on conventional tillage and 96 2 se 3 1 w m 2 on no tillage in mid february 2017 as a result swe decreased up to 9 and 12 mm d 1 2 5 cm d 1 as snow depth faster from january applications compared to december applications and controls in conventional versus no tillage respectively fig 2 snowpack disappeared up to three days earlier during thaw events effectively reducing the length of the events by half while different in scale the trends are in agreement with those regarding dust deposition on subalpine snowpack as radiative absorption increased by 35 70 w m 2 from dust 600 mm of swe disappeared 51 days earlier than in regions of dust free snow skiles et al 2012 a secondary difference in reflected solar radiation arose from tillage type during the late december 2016 and mid february 2017 the average daily reflected solar radiation from conventional tillage was up to 50 w m 2 lower than no tillage fig 4 this difference is attributed to the network of ridges and furrows created by the fall chisel plow snow tended to be thinner on the ridges allowing the underlying bare soil surface to influence the snow surface albedo and in turn cause the thinner snow to regress during melts therefore the presence of the ridges lowered albedo allowing for greater absorption of solar radiation with conventional tillage under no tillage snowpack was able to form as a deeper continuous layer with a greater albedo unless manure was added in late january the strong contrast in reflected solar radiation between january manure applications and controls was lower in conventional tillage when soil ridges were exposed than in no tillage the average and maximum daily surface temperatures of the plots were not significantly different fig 5 thus differences in outgoing longwave radiation were also not significant the decrease in albedo from solid bedded manure applications can increase the temperature of the manure layer above freezing kongoli and bland 2002 the lack of surface heating from liquid manure however may be attributed to the interaction between the manure and snowpack after liquid manure is applied the manure does not remain as a discrete layer but instead infiltrates into the snow with little residue left at the snow surface creating a mixed snow manure layer with a lowered albedo the thermal conductivity of the liquid manure was 0 62 0 70 w m 1 k 1 or 5 5 times greater than that of the solid bedded manure measured by kongoli and bland 2002 due to the higher water content and potential sand bedding residuals associated with liquid manure systems consequently as the albedo decreased from manure applications the absorbed energy was transmitted to the snowpack instead of being confined to the manure fig 6 the net radiation during thaw events indicated the legacy effect of late january applications of liquid manure on snow albedo regardless of tillage and highlights the risk of accelerating snowmelt and increasing potential nutrient loads in runoff the cumulative net radiation was 5 1 mj m 2 d 1 greater from january applications versus controls or december applications across tillages during the 6 8 february 2017 thaw and 19 mj m 2 d 1 greater during 10 14 february 2017 cumulative across the season on dates in which albedo was measured net radiation was 4 5 mj m 2 d 1 greater with december application compared to unmanured control and 44 0 mj m 2 d 1 greater with january application compared to the control the increases in net radiation and accelerated snowmelt resulted in greater runoff losses from the late january manure application while all wintertime manure additions inherently add risk to runoff losses vadas et al 2017 liquid manure applied in late january intensified surface nutrient transport table 3 the earlier onset of runoff and increase to the total runoff volume caused concentrated nutrient loads during key melt events on frozen soils as a result surface losses of nitrogen and phosphorus doubled on soils with late january applications compared to those with early december this is attributed to the prolonged increase in net radiation from the late january application regardless of new snowfall that infiltrated underlying snowpack and directly transmitted absorbed solar radiation to melt processes changes to the surface energy balance from late applications of liquid manure add further concern to this sensitive time of year by coinciding with environmental conditions that already promote runoff on frozen soils slowed infiltration from greater pore ice development niu and yang 2006 increasing intensity of solar irradiance after the winter solstice increasing air temperature and greater frequency of rain this contrasts the mulching effect from solid bedded manure that allows more time for infiltration by slowing snowmelt thereby reducing some nutrient loss from applications kongoli and bland 2002 therefore wintertime applications of liquid manure and especially those later in the freezing season add risk to nutrient management by accelerating snowmelt which generates additional environmental concerns for runoff as producers move from solid to liquid manure forms 4 conclusion this study monitored the influence of liquid dairy manure application timing early versus later in the freezing season and tillage conventional fall tillage with a chisel plow versus no tillage on the resultant radiative energy fluxes on soils with snowpack first a multiple linear regression model was developed with digital imagery and readily obtained site characteristics to repeatedly estimate plot scale albedo over time after dynamic snow behavior and field operations with these estimates of albedo radiative fluxes were calculated for each management treatment liquid manure applied on top of snow infiltrated the underlying snowpack creating a generally homogenized snow manure layer with a lower albedo while early winter applications of manure did not alter radiative energy fluxes through albedo longer than the day of the application late january applications produced a lasting effect as mixed precipitation and more intense irradiance after the solstice reduced masking of the manure layer the surface roughness from conventional tillage reduced albedo but the effect of tillage on radiative fluxes was secondary to manure application timing late applications of liquid manure ultimately accelerated snowmelt that increased runoff and doubled nutrient loads posing a challenge to nutrient retention on frozen ground conflict of interest none acknowledgements this work was funded by the usda national institute of food and agriculture agriculture and food research initiative

6749,the groundwater tracers deuterium 2h or d and oxygen 18 18o are widely used to determine groundwater recharge origin rate and temperature quantitative methods able to interpret δd and δ18o mobility in the subsurface especially under high pressure and temperature conditions remain the focus of ongoing research here we developed an isotope transport module as an add on to the tough2 simulator which is able to describe the evolution of δd and δ18o in groundwater induced by advection dispersion water rock interaction and fractionation due to changes of water phase and density the new model was tested by modelling the groundwater flow temperature fluid density and isotopic composition in a faulted geothermal system in the guide basin china we found that the density driven flow induced by temperature variations can lead to isotope fractionation between low and high density water in addition the density driven flow creates multiple flow systems in the fault damage zone increasing the complexity of the spatiotemporal isotope distribution the results indicate that in scenarios where a density contrast occurs such as in geothermal systems the relationship between δd and δ18o in recharge water and discharging groundwater can only be fully understood if the coupled processes of fluid flow heat transport and isotope fractionation in the subsurface are accounted for

to trace water movement within the aquifer soil vegetationatmosphere system reconstruct the paleoclimate and reveal the water and heat sources of geothermal systems andrews 2006 gardner et al 2011 gat 1996 giuliani et al 2014 rye and truesdell 2007 swann and leng 2009 truesdell et al 1977 zhu 2000 the methodology of extracting useful information from δd and δ18o values in water and minerals attracts wide discussion in both hydrology and geology a key principle underpinning the δd and δ18o analysis in hydrology is based on the meteoric water line mwl which expresses a linear relationship between δd and δ18o values due to isotope fractionation during condensation from a water vapor mass craig 1961a craig 1961b δd and δ18o values can shift from the mwl due to evaporation and often show altitude and seasonal effects among others as a result the groundwater recharge source becomes uniquely labelled across the landscape which provides a useful tool to monitor climatic and anthropogenic changes in the watershed andrews 2006 clark and fritz 1997 and is applied to quantify recharge rate sharma and hughes 1985 mixing ratios among multiple water sources in aquifers clark and fritz 1997 gat et al 1969 and evaporation rate in the unsaturated zones barnes and allison 1988 gaj et al 2016 for example evaporation rates can be estimated from δ18o values measured in soil water using a simple linear isotope gradient model in a 1d soil column wang and yakir 2000 zimmermann et al 1966 furthermore numerical models such as sispat isotope braud et al 2005 odwish shurbaji and phillips 1995 shurbaji et al 1995 and fehm kwicklis et al 2006 were developed to describe the evaporation processes in soil which involves simulations of transient heat water and isotope transport within the unsaturated zone in hydrology d and 18o in water are commonly transported at temperature conditions close to atmospheric temperature in such circumstances changes in δd and δ18o values in the unsaturated zone and unconfined aquifers are mainly the result of evaporation advection and dispersion in contrast the interpretation of δd and δ18o values in geology may involve diagenetic processes at temperatures higher than 300 c under these scenarios the isotopic exchange between fluid here water and minerals becomes important often resulting in δ18o enrichment of water cole et al 1983 the mechanisms of isotopic exchange between fluid and minerals at high ambient temperature have been well established mainly based on laboratory tests and field observations cole et al 1987 gregory et al 1989 zheng 1993 a summary of kinetic reaction rates and mechanism of the isotopic exchange reactions is provided by cole and chakraborty 2001 the theory of isotopic exchange has been incorporated into isotope transport equations and coupled with subsurface fluid flow and heat transport in the subsurface forming the numerical models that are capable of reproducing the coupled processes of fluid flow energy transport and isotopic reactions jenkin et al 1991 norton and taylor 1979 for example norton and taylor 1979 numerically computed the redistribution of 18o among minerals and aqueous solutions in a system of magma intruding into permeable rocks demonstrating that δ18o values in water and minerals are constrained by subsurface temperatures and geothermal processes jenkin et al 1991 numerically compared δ18o values in quartz and alkali feldspar that formed in an open system with fluid infiltration and alternatively in a closed system where the igneous rocks cool slowly they successfully described the mineralization processes based on δ18o values in water and minerals most of the numerical models of coupled isotope fluid and energy transport focused on the isotope behaviour either in the soil unsaturated zone conditional to atmospheric temperature or in the deep subsurface at high temperature at atmospheric temperature the major processes causing changes of isotope composition in water by e g evaporation and freezing thawing while at high subsurface temperature the changes of isotope composition are mainly controlled by fluid mineral interactions i e chemical reactions in contrast δd and δ18o changes in groundwater at low to medium temperature from 300 c to atmospheric temperature have attracted much less discussion to date this intermediate temperature range corresponds to the temperature in the majority of viable geothermal energy reservoirs around the world limberger et al 2018 addressing this knowledge gap has implications for understanding predicting and managing these geothermal systems previously models applied to this intermediate temperature range considered stable isotopes as conservative chemical components which are transported in the subsurface with water by advection and dispersion adar et al 1992 however in addition to the dispersion and advection with fluid flow the isotopic composition can vary due to water rock interactions and importantly it can also vary due to phase or density changes associated with the strong variations of temperature and pressure when water is transported from the hot subsurface to the land surface todesco 1997 brikowski 2001 modified the two dimensional advection dispersion equation to describe δ18o variation in the geysers geothermal system which considered the water rock exchange of 18o at temperatures lower than 300 c assuming constant δ18o values in minerals fekete et al 2018 developed a one dimensional non isothermal single and two phase fluid flow model which accounted for the effects of quartz precipitation and dissolution on oxygen isotopic compositions in both fluid and rocks during fluid rock interaction gottardi et al 2013 implemented a macroscopic lattice boltzmann model to demonstrate the coupled processes of fluid heat and isotope reactive transport in the crust subject to multiple representative permeabilities in fault zones they illustrated that the density contrast can alter the pattern of isotope composition due to the changes of fluid and heat transport under the buoyancy effect however to our knowledges the isotopic fractionation between low density and high density fluids due to changes in the mobility of heavy isotopes under varying temperature and pressure driesner 1997 has not been addressed in the geothermal system most governing equations established for isotope changes in the subsurface merely replace the isotope concentration by the isotope ratio or even by the δ value of the isotope assuming a constant density value in the fluid we here modify the advection dispersion equation by using the heavy isotope ratio as variable to replace the heavy isotope concentration considering the spatiotemporal variation of fluid density a numerical isotope model is developed based on the multiphase multicomponent transport model tough2 pruess et al 1999 the new coupled model is capable of describing the isotope fractionation during phase changes and fluid density variations in the subsurface the model is applied and tested in a fault controlled hydrogeothermal system in the guide basin china to demonstrate δd and δ18o behaviours in the shallow crust 2 theory our model is based on tough2 which is a numerical simulator for non isothermal flows of multicomponent multiphase fluids in one two and three

respectively the transfer coefficient β 0 for u 0 while β 1 for u 0 in addition r 0 is the isotope ratio in recharge water when the fluid flux q 0 recharge and r 0 is equal to the isotope ratio in element n r n when the fluid flux q 0 discharge eq 10 is programmed as an isotope module and sequentially coupled with the fluid and heat transport model in tough2 the algorithm is summarized in fig 1 in this operator splitting or non iterative sequential approach the fluid heat transport and isotope chemistry equations are solved separately this is contrary to the one step global implicit approach in which the transport and isotope chemistry equations are solved simultaneously for a discussion on advantages and disadvantages of both approaches see jacques et al 2006 adequate time step control is required for transient flow simulations coupled with an isotope module the numerical modelling of heat and fluid transport processes in tough2 results in the spatiotemporal distribution of temperature liquid and vapor phase saturation fluid and vapor velocity and density these variables are then used in the isotope module to calculate the coefficients that control the isotope distribution eq 9 subsequently the jacobian matrix is constructed based on eq 10 and is solved by the preconditioned conjugate gradient approach leading to an isotope ratio r once r is solved it is converted to δ notation by 11 δ r r ref 1 1000 it is noted that r in eq 6 cannot be replaced directly by δ as the coefficients for advection and dispersion in eq 9 are functions of density which vary spatially and temporally otherwise an additional term relating to the spatiotemporal variation of density would be generated in eq 8 by using r as the variable in eq 4 to replace concentration c in eq 2 liquid and vapor phase density ρ l and ρ v and isotope ratios r are calculated separately at each time step which allows eq 8 to incorporate the density effects on the isotope fractionation for example in a one dimensional saturated single phase fluid only and vertical advective system the governing equation for isotope transport eq 8 can be rewritten as 12 ϕ ρ r t u ρ r x both u and ρ were determined by the transport of ordinary water resulting from eq 1 as the heavy isotopes of hdo and h2 18o occupy a small amount in the water to emphasize the density effects we start with the same initial r value at the time t at position and x x eq 12 can then be discretized as 13 ϕ ρ x t 1 r x t 1 r x t δ t u x x δ x t 1 ρ x t 1 ρ x δ x t 1 δ x r x t given that δ t u x x δ x t 1 δ x ϕ 1 eq 13 can be further simplified as 14 r x t 1 r x t ρ x t 1 ρ x δ x t 1 ρ x t 1 r x t eq 14 suggests that if the temperature increases along the flow direction from to x x ρx ρx x heavy isotope enrichment occurs at the position which is comparable to the processes of evaporation while the temperature decreases along the flow direction from to x x ρx ρx x heavy isotope depletion occurs at the position which is comparable to the processes of condensation the mathematical derivation above follows the mass balance of water in a flowing system physically it was found that both temperature and pressure can induce isotropic fractionation in water due to the dependency of vibrational frequencies on pressure and temperature spectra inspection indicates that the fractionation coefficient is linearly related to the pressure 200 mpa and temperature 300 c driesner 1997 as also the density varies linearly with pressure and temperature substituting the density in eq 12 by the fractionation coefficient to consider the effects of pressure and temperature explicitly the same r values can be obtained for the purpose of achieving acceptable computational efficiencies for large two or three dimensional domains the isotope module established here does not consider detailed chemical reaction processes between water and minerals that might influence isotopic exchanges although complex rock water interactions are a strength of the tough family of codes i e toughreact xu et al 2006 implementation of a full blown reactive transport module also requires availability of detailed mineralogical and pore water composition to build a site specific geochemical model such data is often not available as was the case in this study with only limited mineralogical data defined table 2 instead we used the kinetic rate of reaction approach from cole and chakraborty 2001 to describe the isotopic changes in water as induced by chemical reactions at elevated temperatures brikowski 2001 fekete et al 2018 these first order simplifications are an acceptable approach when the purpose is to explore the importance of various coupled processes in determining the spatiotemporal distribution of stable isotopes in a geothermal groundwater system in addition we here focus on the isotope changes in the subsurface and the influence of processes on the land surface e g evaporation are not considered 3 model implementation and testing 3 1 site description the zhacang geothermal field in the qinghai province china is located in the central guide basin northeastern tibetan plateau fig 2 the temperature anomaly 60 c at the zhacang spring rs11 has attracted geothermal exploration campaigns in the guide basin since 2011 two wells zr1 and rs7 were drilled and the outflow temperatures of both wells exceed 90 c at depths of about 200 m the finalized depth of zr1 is 3000 m which revealed hot granite with a temperature of 150 c considering this high temperature condition a pilot experimental site is scheduled to be established at the zhacang geothermal field to jointly exploit geothermal energy stored in hot wet and dry rock 3 2 data collection and geothermal processes analysis to understand the geothermal processes at the zhacang geothermal field groundwater samples were collected from springs rs3 and rs11 and artesian wells well zr1 had a single screen from 50 m to 1500 m and was uncased from 1500 m to 3000 m depth while rs7 had a single screen from 70 m to 200 m rainwaters in the guide basin in two rain events in august 2015 rain 1 to 2016 rain 2 were also collected respectively we measured the isotopes δd δ18o 3he 4he 87sr 86sr in these water samples and the mineral composition of rock samples collected along a depth profile from 203 to 2400 m below surface from drillhole zr1 tables 1 and 2 however it is noted that the isotope compositions measured in the water samples collected in recharge area e g rain 1 and rain 2 rs3 represent the values in summer which likely do not fully represent the isotope compositions in recharge water thus the isotope composition in recharge water is a variable to adjust in section 3 4 the hydrogeochemical analysis and numerical modelling of heat and fluid transport previously reported by jiang et al 2018b concluded that the geothermal water at the zhacang geothermal field is initially recharged by the surface water from the gangyi stream which flows west to east and nearly parallel to fault f2 fig 2c recharge into the subsurface occurs via the normal fault f2 while discharge is observed at the zhacang spring rs11 where the reverse fault f5 provides for a barrier to horizontal flow forcing upward fluid flow along the fault damage zone fig 2 3he 4he isotope ratio in the thermal water indicates that the thermal anomaly in the zhacang geothermal field can be attributed to heat produced from depths 3000 m and that the heat generated by u and th decay in the depth 3000 m is negligible jiang et al 2018b the 87sr 86sr value of 0 7143 suggests a water granodiorite granite interaction along the flow paths water rock interaction mainly between water and silica feldspar has induced δ18o enrichment jiang et al 2018b it was previously demonstrated that the δ18o in groundwater can be altered by reaction between water and minerals including silica feldspar and co2 carbonate rocks johnson et al 2011 karolytė et al 2017 while δd can be altered by chemical reactions between water and hydrous minerals e g hornblende and biotite godfrey 1962 in this site as is evident from table 2 there is little calcite in the reservoir rocks and the geothermal waters are of the na cl type therefore δ18o changes due to water co2 carbonate rocks are considered unimportant while δ18o changes due to reaction between water silica and feldspar are accounted for in our simulation in addition the influence of isotope exchange between water and rock on the δd value is neglected as the amount of hydrous minerals is relatively small in granite according to the xrd analysis on rock samples table 2 3 3 model conceptualization based on the geothermal conditions at the zhacang geothermal field we numerically simulated the evolution of δd and δ18o values in groundwater with temperatures ranging from 5 c snow melting temperature to 150 c temperature measured in the drillhole zr1 at the bottom of the fault zone the assumed vertically conductive fault f2 occurred over a distance of approximately 2500 m in the granite and granodiorite fig 2a the lateral recharge from the host rock in the direction orthogonal to the fault plane to the fault zone is assumed very limited owing to the low permeability of the surrounding rock hence a zero flux boundary condition was imposed along the two vertical boundaries i e fault face a two dimensional vertical slab model is constructed to simulate the fluid heat isotope transport in the hydraulically conductive fault f2 which has a length of 2500 m x depth of 3000 m y and width of 20 m z figs 3 a and 2 the model domain is discretized into 3000 elements with the size of each element equal to 50 m 20 m 50 m we tested that further refinement of the elements did not alter the results significantly although the computation time increased largely fig 4 a the magnitude of the time step is automatically adjusted in tough2 according to the user defined iteration convergence the boundary conditions and the parameters for fluid i e total water flux including liquid and vapor phase and heat transport are summarized in fig 3a according to the 2015 2016 field investigations fig 2 water is recharged from the west side of the fault over a distance of 500 m and discharged along a 200 m long section at the east model boundary the recharge rate is equal to the maximum stream flow rate 1 25 kg s comparable to the discharge rate in discharge zone observed along the fault f2 which completely infiltrates into the fault within a distance of 500 m fig 2d the pressure at the discharge zone is assigned to be at one atmosphere pressure to represent the artesian wells and springs a constant temperature of 5 c representing the local average atmospheric temperature is assigned in the recharge area while a zero temperature gradient boundary condition is set at nodes where water leaves the domain allowing the water to be discharged without heat loss to be consistent with the observed temperature logs in drillhole zr1 a constant temperature of 150 c is given at the fault bottom a zero fluid flux boundary is set at both left and right model boundaries as the hydraulic conductivity in the granite beyond the fault zone is assumed to be very low a zero heat flux is assumed on both left and right sides of the fault as there is no lateral water flux to drive heat convection and the heat conduction via the side boundary is far less than that via the fault bottom and therefore has a negligible influence on the temperature in the fault zone the rationale for boundary conditions for heat and fluid transport was discussed in our companion paper jiang et al 2018a under the flow and heat boundary conditions above the calculated temperature in zr1 fits with the observations when the permeability is adjusted to 50 md fig 3b jiang et al 2018b a maximum error of 7 c occurs at 1200 m this is attributed to the heterogeneous lithology distribution in the real situation which in this model is assumed to be fractured granite with a uniform permeability we hereafter focus on the isotope behaviour in the subsurface zone with a homogeneous permeability in this hydrogeothermal system the spatiotemporal variation of δd in water is induced by advection dispersion and possibly fractionation during phase changes of water in contrast δ18o could also enrich in the geothermal system due to interactions between water and minerals silica and feldspar in granite which is quantified by the reaction rate constant krl diffusion coefficients fractionation factors and the reaction rate constant depend on the temperature all of which are summarized in table 3 3 4 sensitivity analysis and isotope model adjustment since the boundary conditions and parameters controlling the fluid and heat processes were determined in our previous works jiang et al 2018a jiang et al 2018b we here investigate the sensitivity of isotope composition taking δ18o as an example in drillhole zr1 at the discharge zone to additional uncertainty factors these include the reaction rate constant krl between h2 18o and granite which ranges from 0 to 10 7 1 s up to temperatures of 300 c cole and chakraborty 2001 and the dispersivity considering the range between 0 and 150 m voss 1984 the sensitivity analysis was carried out using three levels of each parameter minimum best estimate and maximum value in a factorial design approach yielding nine parameter combinations moreover although the isotope composition in the recharge water was measured in summer rainwater and rs3 in table 1 it changes with temperature it was reported that δ18o in rainwater and snowmelt water near this current study area ranges from 24 40 in late winter or in cold paleoclimate to 2 80 in rainwater in summer respectively cui and li 2015 the sensitivity of the isotope composition in the discharge water in well zr1 to that in recharge water is analyzed as well in this case both dispersivity and reaction rate constant were kept at zero as shown in fig 5 δ18o in the discharge water increases with both δ18o in recharge water and reaction rate constant fig 5a and c when the reaction rate constant exceeds 10 11 the δ18o enriched in water becomes larger than that in granite and the δ18o in water stabilizes at a value of 10 fig 5c which is equal to that assigned in granite we here assume an irreversible reaction processes from granite to water without considering the re deposition of silica and assume that the δ18o in minerals is higher than that in water varying the dispersivity has a negligible influence on the δ18o in the discharge water when compared to the influence of previous two factor fig 5b and d the reason for this is that in this geothermal system the heat and isotope transport are mainly controlled by advection and the dispersion processes is weak the relationship between δd in the discharge water and that in recharge water and dispersivity is similar to that of δ18o the effect of dispersivity is equally weak as it was for δ18o while δd changes due to water rock interaction are neglected in this work following the results of the sensitivity analysis the uncertain δd value in the recharge water in the range below 42 δd measured in the summer rainwater in table 1 is adjusted until the calculated δd value in zr1 agrees with the observed values fig 6 a the water samples representing discharge from the fault zone were collected from a thermal spring and artesian wells table 1 with water in the wells assumed to be well mixed due to strong convection along the well bore note that the flow and heat processes in the wellbore are not simulated separately in this study and the influence of heterogeneity on the water flux into the well is not considered therefore a flux weighted average of the calculated δd values along the entire vertical profile at zr1 fig 3 is compared to the observed values in water samples from springs and boreholes table 1 to obtain the natural distribution of δd in the fault f2 the model is run until pressure temperature and isotope ratio reach a quasi steady state i e pressure and temperature fluctuate regularly due to the flow driven by gravity and buoyancy force see jiang et al 2018b and average isotope ratio is relatively stable the initial δd values in the model domain are arbitrarily given as 100 this assumption does not affect the stabilized isotope composition in the system fig 4b as the initial water composition in the system is gradually replaced by the recharge water when δd in recharge water is adjusted to 79 δd varies nonlinearly in zr1 in the range of 88 to 83 with an average value of 83 8 fig 6a this average value agrees well with δd measured in the thermal water collected at the zhacang geothermal field table 1 this estimated δd in recharge water is depleted by 15 relative to the values measured in spring rs3 64 in summer suggesting the thermal water is recharged in cold season or by snow melting water moreover it is found that the isotope compositions in discharge waters vary across the discharge area fig 8c in zr1 x 2500 m the average δd is lighter than that in the recharge water while at the position of x 2300 m average δd can reach 74 3 which is 4 7 heavier than that in recharge water the mechanism of spatial variation of heavy isotope composition is further explained in section 4 2 δ18o value in recharge water was subsequently determined to be 11 9 from the optimized δd value following the local meteoric water line δd 6 9δ18o 3 3 tan et al 2012 according to the relationship between temperature and δ18o in the northeastern tibetan plateau δ18o 0 567 t 14 27 tian et al 2003 the recharge temperature for δ18o of 11 9 is estimated at 4 c which aligns with the recharge temperature of 5 c used in the heat flow model to fit the temperature in zr1 with observations fig 3 since the stable isotope ratio in recharge water is estimated the reaction rate constant k rl is adjusted manually to fit the observed δ18o value in the water sample collected from zr1 when the average k rl over the entire model domain is equal to 9 5 10 13 1 s corresponding to a 0 9 10 13 1 s the mean of δ18o in zr1 is estimated at 10 8 which matches the observations in the spring and water well table 1 the reaction between water and minerals in granite results in δ18o in zr1 to enrich by approximately 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 δd and δ18o in a fault zone under high temperature fig 7 illustrates four snapshots 10 days 1100 years 1600 years and 2300 years of temperature δd and δ18o distribution in the fault f2 it is observed that δd and δ18o distributions are more complex than that of temperature the temperature generally increases from west to east in the horizontal direction and decreases with the depth in the vertical direction a different trend is observed for stable isotopes in the horizontal distance between 2200 and 2500 m which decreases towards the west both heat and isotope transports are controlled by advection and dispersion however the isotope composition can vary with the fractionation during phase changes of water and the coefficients for advection and dispersion for isotope transport depend on the fluid density eq 9 which changes with temperature at the zhacang geothermal field temperature at the fault bottom is 150 c which is too low for phase changes to occur it is demonstrated in fig 8 that the phase changes occur when the maximum system temperature exceeds 180 c in this given model domain therefore the different patterns between isotope and temperature distribution at a distance between 2200 and 2500 m must be influenced by fluid density this indicates that isotope fractionation not only occurs with phase change but it also exists between waters with different densities 4 2 density effects on the isotope distribution to further clarify the mechanism of density effects on the isotope distribution in the geothermal system δd values are calculated in two different ways in the first approach density effects on the isotope compositions are neglected in the second approach the effect of fluid density on isotope ratio is explicitly considered approach 1 a numerical model is established based on governing eqs 1 and 2 which uses the concentration of hdo in water as a variable the hdo concentration in the recharge water is estimated at 0 1534 kg m3 corresponding to a δd value of 80 r of 1 45 10 4 r ref of 1 58 10 4 density of 1000 kg m3 and λ between hdo and h2o of 19 18 in eqs 4 and 11 once the partial differential equations for the temperature pressure density and concentration are solved the hdo concentration is converted to the δd value based on eqs 4 and 11 at the end of calculation in this case the influence of temporal variation of density on the isotope changes is neglected fig 8a and b approach 2 using the isotope ratio r as a variable the isotope distribution in the geothermal system is described by eq 8 and 10 the r value in recharge water is given as 1 45 10 4 corresponding to a δd value of 80 in this case r and fluid density are calculated simultaneously at each time step and the influence of fluid density on r is addressed fig 8a and c both approaches are explored with our new model before discussing the differences between approach 1 and 2 a model inter comparison is undertaken to verify the correctness of the numerical implementation of the new isotope module using feflow the verification was done only for approach 1 because feflow does not account for the coupling between fluid density and isotope ratio approach 2 feflow is a groundwater modelling software able to solve fluid heat and solute transport equations based on the finite element method diersch 2013 results for approach 1 show that during the period from initial state to the steady state δd values in drillhole zr1 calculated by the new isotope module are comparable to the feflow results for bottom temperatures from 50 c to 150 c as the maximum temperature allowed in feflow is 150 c fig 8a this gives confidence that the convection dispersion equation has been properly implemented in the isotope module the δd values resulting from feflow are slightly higher because feflow calculates density based on temperature only while in tough2 the density is related to both temperature and pressure in the subsurface system the discussion now continues with a comparison between approach 1 and 2 as shown in fig 8b δd values increase from the recharge area towards the discharge area under approach 1 which however does not fully address the processes of isotope fractionation between fluids with different densities eq 4 implies a negative relationship between the heavy isotope ratio and density the heavy isotope can enrich as the density decreases at high temperature this cannot happen in a closed system rather it should occur in an open and flowing system for instance where the increase of temperature in one cell the mesh element after domain discretization leads to the water expanding and flowing to another cell as the mobility of a heavy isotope is weaker than that of a light isotope more light isotopes move out and the heavy isotope enrichment occurs in other words the difference in the mobility between heavy isotopes in low density fluid and high density fluid i e the circumstances with different temperatures and pressures can induce isotope fractionation however using approach 1 the isotope ratio is indeed calculated in a static sense merely by removing the density from the end state isotope concentration based on eq 4 in a closed cell in contrast using approach 2 the isotope ratio and density are calculated simultaneously in the flow system for example at position 1 in fig 8c assuming the same initial isotope ratio in two cells fig 8d gravity driven advection from cooler areas with high density fluid to warmer areas with low density fluid leads to isotope enrichment along the flow path from upstream to the downstream eq 14 at position 2 temperature differences causes density driven flow in a reverse direction which brings the enriched heavy isotope back towards the upstream positions which is a process comparable to the water condensation from vapor phase to liquid phase when this dynamic system reaches a steady state a non monotonic δd pattern in space is obtained with the heavy isotope enriching near the discharge area in this case at x 2300 m and depleting towards both downstream and upstream zones in the horizontal direction in the vertical direction the highest δd occurs at the depth about 1200 m and depletes towards both shallower and deeper zone fig 6a due to the density effects δd values in the discharge water are likely going to be different from that in the recharge water owing to the isotopic fractionation occurring in the geothermal system when the maximum system temperature ranges from 50 c to 180 c phase changes do not occur and the δd values in the discharge area can be different from that in the recharge water by less than 10 however when the maximum temperature becomes higher than 180 c based on the model discussed in this study phase changes occur near the land surface in the discharge zone which leads to further enrichment of the heavy isotope in the discharging water the δd enrichment between discharged water and recharge water at the temperature of 220 c can reach 30 however most δd values measured in the water samples collected in the discharge area are not only representative of deep circulation water but also mix with water from recharge areas exhibiting shorter flow paths thus the observable difference between δd values in the discharge water collected on the land surface and recharge water is often lower than that predicted in this model and is dependent on the sampling positions fig 8c 4 3 summary fig 9 further illustrates the coupled processes of heat flow and isotope transport in fault f2 as shown in fig 9a two flow systems appear in the hydraulically conductive zone of f2 in the left hand side the infiltration of cool water from the recharge area in the west leads to the downward fluid flow driven by gravity force while in right hand side the density contrast due to the temperature variation can result in an upward density driven fluid flow induced by buoyancy force the influences of both gravity and density driven flow results in the concave pattern of isotope composition with depth seen in fig 6 we arbitrarily select one flow path in both flow systems and trace δd and δ18o variations along the flow paths as can be seen in fig 9b a comprehensive evolution process of δd and δ18o is displayed above the land surface δd and δ18o values in recharge water of this geothermal system are estimated at 79 and 11 9 respectively which is depleted by about 30 and 4 respectively when compared to the isotopic composition in rainwater collected in summer table 2 the isotope composition in the recharge water corresponds to a recharge temperature of about 4 c which represents snowmelt water recharge or recharge in a cold climate once the recharge water infiltrates into the subsurface zone δ18o increases by 8 due to water rock interactions and δd also increases slightly due to advection and dispersion the variability of δd in the high temperature flow system in the east is greater than the flow system in the west due to the influence of the density contrast at higher temperature in summary density variations in high temperature systems could lead to multiple flow systems with isotope fractionation happening in the same water bearing formation as an example at the zhacang geothermal field two flow systems appear in the hydraulically conductive zone of f2 where water discharging from the well zr1 is indirectly related to the recharge water in the west this suggests that without a coupled model of flow heat and isotope fractionation processes the use of environmental tracers such as stable isotopes of water for the understanding of coupled heat water flow in conductive faults under a geothermal regime may be limited 5 conclusions we developed a coupled fluid heat isotope transport module as an add on to the tough2 simulator which can be applied to simulate δd and δ18o in groundwater with temperature ranging from atmosphere temperature to 300 c the transport model considered the isotope changes induced by advection dispersion water rock interaction and fractionation induced by water density changes and phase shift the model was implemented in the guide basin china to simulate the co evolution of temperature pressure and δd and δ18o values in a geothermal system with flow being controlled by a geological fault the δd change in the guide basin geothermal system is mainly the result of advective and dispersive transport while the δ18o change is further controlled by water rock interactions importantly the high degree of temperature variation leads to an upward density driven flow which creates two flow systems in the hydraulically conductive fault zone and promotes further isotopic changes in the hydrogeothermal system moreover the variation of density affects advection and dispersion coefficients as a consequence a fractionation phenomenon appears between the low and high density fluid for a system with temperatures above 50 c the influence of fluid density differences on isotope composition changes is considerable and it affects the isotopic condition of discharge waters as a result the isotope composition in the discharged groundwater can be used to infer details about subsurface processes such inference however requires use of a coupled model of heat fluid isotope transport as dis cussed here acknowledgement funding support for this study was provided by the national natural science

6749,the groundwater tracers deuterium 2h or d and oxygen 18 18o are widely used to determine groundwater recharge origin rate and temperature quantitative methods able to interpret δd and δ18o mobility in the subsurface especially under high pressure and temperature conditions remain the focus of ongoing research here we developed an isotope transport module as an add on to the tough2 simulator which is able to describe the evolution of δd and δ18o in groundwater induced by advection dispersion water rock interaction and fractionation due to changes of water phase and density the new model was tested by modelling the groundwater flow temperature fluid density and isotopic composition in a faulted geothermal system in the guide basin china we found that the density driven flow induced by temperature variations can lead to isotope fractionation between low and high density water in addition the density driven flow creates multiple flow systems in the fault damage zone increasing the complexity of the spatiotemporal isotope distribution the results indicate that in scenarios where a density contrast occurs such as in geothermal systems the relationship between δd and δ18o in recharge water and discharging groundwater can only be fully understood if the coupled processes of fluid flow heat transport and isotope fractionation in the subsurface are accounted for

simple linear isotope gradient model in a 1d soil column wang and yakir 2000 zimmermann et al 1966 furthermore numerical models such as sispat isotope braud et al 2005 odwish shurbaji and phillips 1995 shurbaji et al 1995 and fehm kwicklis et al 2006 were developed to describe the evaporation processes in soil which involves simulations of transient heat water and isotope transport within the unsaturated zone in hydrology d and 18o in water are commonly transported at temperature conditions close to atmospheric temperature in such circumstances changes in δd and δ18o values in the unsaturated zone and unconfined aquifers are mainly the result of evaporation advection and dispersion in contrast the interpretation of δd and δ18o values in geology may involve diagenetic processes at temperatures higher than 300 c under these scenarios the isotopic exchange between fluid here water and minerals becomes important often resulting in δ18o enrichment of water cole et al 1983 the mechanisms of isotopic exchange between fluid and minerals at high ambient temperature have been well established mainly based on laboratory tests and field observations cole et al 1987 gregory et al 1989 zheng 1993 a summary of kinetic reaction rates and mechanism of the isotopic exchange reactions is provided by cole and chakraborty 2001 the theory of isotopic exchange has been incorporated into isotope transport equations and coupled with subsurface fluid flow and heat transport in the subsurface forming the numerical models that are capable of reproducing the coupled processes of fluid flow energy transport and isotopic reactions jenkin et al 1991 norton and taylor 1979 for example norton and taylor 1979 numerically computed the redistribution of 18o among minerals and aqueous solutions in a system of magma intruding into permeable rocks demonstrating that δ18o values in water and minerals are constrained by subsurface temperatures and geothermal processes jenkin et al 1991 numerically compared δ18o values in quartz and alkali feldspar that formed in an open system with fluid infiltration and alternatively in a closed system where the igneous rocks cool slowly they successfully described the mineralization processes based on δ18o values in water and minerals most of the numerical models of coupled isotope fluid and energy transport focused on the isotope behaviour either in the soil unsaturated zone conditional to atmospheric temperature or in the deep subsurface at high temperature at atmospheric temperature the major processes causing changes of isotope composition in water by e g evaporation and freezing thawing while at high subsurface temperature the changes of isotope composition are mainly controlled by fluid mineral interactions i e chemical reactions in contrast δd and δ18o changes in groundwater at low to medium temperature from 300 c to atmospheric temperature have attracted much less discussion to date this intermediate temperature range corresponds to the temperature in the majority of viable geothermal energy reservoirs around the world limberger et al 2018 addressing this knowledge gap has implications for understanding predicting and managing these geothermal systems previously models applied to this intermediate temperature range considered stable isotopes as conservative chemical components which are transported in the subsurface with water by advection and dispersion adar et al 1992 however in addition to the dispersion and advection with fluid flow the isotopic composition can vary due to water rock interactions and importantly it can also vary due to phase or density changes associated with the strong variations of temperature and pressure when water is transported from the hot subsurface to the land surface todesco 1997 brikowski 2001 modified the two dimensional advection dispersion equation to describe δ18o variation in the geysers geothermal system which considered the water rock exchange of 18o at temperatures lower than 300 c assuming constant δ18o values in minerals fekete et al 2018 developed a one dimensional non isothermal single and two phase fluid flow model which accounted for the effects of quartz precipitation and dissolution on oxygen isotopic compositions in both fluid and rocks during fluid rock interaction gottardi et al 2013 implemented a macroscopic lattice boltzmann model to demonstrate the coupled processes of fluid heat and isotope reactive transport in the crust subject to multiple representative permeabilities in fault zones they illustrated that the density contrast can alter the pattern of isotope composition due to the changes of fluid and heat transport under the buoyancy effect however to our knowledges the isotopic fractionation between low density and high density fluids due to changes in the mobility of heavy isotopes under varying temperature and pressure driesner 1997 has not been addressed in the geothermal system most governing equations established for isotope changes in the subsurface merely replace the isotope concentration by the isotope ratio or even by the δ value of the isotope assuming a constant density value in the fluid we here modify the advection dispersion equation by using the heavy isotope ratio as variable to replace the heavy isotope concentration considering the spatiotemporal variation of fluid density a numerical isotope model is developed based on the multiphase multicomponent transport model tough2 pruess et al 1999 the new coupled model is capable of describing the isotope fractionation during phase changes and fluid density variations in the subsurface the model is applied and tested in a fault controlled hydrogeothermal system in the guide basin china to demonstrate δd and δ18o behaviours in the shallow crust 2 theory our model is based on tough2 which is a numerical simulator for non isothermal flows of multicomponent multiphase fluids in one two and three dimensional porous and fractured media pruess et al 1999 tough2 was initially developed for simulating fluid and heat processes in geothermal systems battistelli et al 1997 by integrating different equations of state eos it was expanded to accommodate applications in nuclear waste disposal dessirier et al 2015 mallants et al 2007 co2 geological storage pruess and spycher 2007 zhang et al 2018 and water vapor gas transport in unsaturated and saturated porous media xu and qi 2001 xu and pruess 2001 eos1 from tough2 is used here which allows fully coupled modelling of heat and multiphase fluid here water and vapor transport in porous media the discretized governing equations of heat and fluid transport are expressed by see table of symbols for definitions of model parameters pruess et al 1999 1 m n t 1 m n t δ t v n m a nm f nm t 1 q n t 1 which is solved iteratively by preconditioned conjugate gradients in tough2 the transport of hdo and h2 18o in ordinary water follows the advection dispersion equation which can be expressed by braud et al 2005 2 ϕ s l c l ϕ s v c v t u l c l u v c v d l c l d v c v 1 ϕ c r t where sl sv 1 and dispersion coefficient d is composed of

respectively the transfer coefficient β 0 for u 0 while β 1 for u 0 in addition r 0 is the isotope ratio in recharge water when the fluid flux q 0 recharge and r 0 is equal to the isotope ratio in element n r n when the fluid flux q 0 discharge eq 10 is programmed as an isotope module and sequentially coupled with the fluid and heat transport model in tough2 the algorithm is summarized in fig 1 in this operator splitting or non iterative sequential approach the fluid heat transport and isotope chemistry equations are solved separately this is contrary to the one step global implicit approach in which the transport and isotope chemistry equations are solved simultaneously for a discussion on advantages and disadvantages of both approaches see jacques et al 2006 adequate time step control is required for transient flow simulations coupled with an isotope module the numerical modelling of heat and fluid transport processes in tough2 results in the spatiotemporal distribution of temperature liquid and vapor phase saturation fluid and vapor velocity and density these variables are then used in the isotope module to calculate the coefficients that control the isotope distribution eq 9 subsequently the jacobian matrix is constructed based on eq 10 and is solved by the preconditioned conjugate gradient approach leading to an isotope ratio r once r is solved it is converted to δ notation by 11 δ r r ref 1 1000 it is noted that r in eq 6 cannot be replaced directly by δ as the coefficients for advection and dispersion in eq 9 are functions of density which vary spatially and temporally otherwise an additional term relating to the spatiotemporal variation of density would be generated in eq 8 by using r as the variable in eq 4 to replace concentration c in eq 2 liquid and vapor phase density ρ l and ρ v and isotope ratios r are calculated separately at each time step which allows eq 8 to incorporate the density effects on the isotope fractionation for example in a one dimensional saturated single phase fluid only and vertical advective system the governing equation for isotope transport eq 8 can be rewritten as 12 ϕ ρ r t u ρ r x both u and ρ were determined by the transport of ordinary water resulting from eq 1 as the heavy isotopes of hdo and h2 18o occupy a small amount in the water to emphasize the density effects we start with the same initial r value at the time t at position and x x eq 12 can then be discretized as 13 ϕ ρ x t 1 r x t 1 r x t δ t u x x δ x t 1 ρ x t 1 ρ x δ x t 1 δ x r x t given that δ t u x x δ x t 1 δ x ϕ 1 eq 13 can be further simplified as 14 r x t 1 r x t ρ x t 1 ρ x δ x t 1 ρ x t 1 r x t eq 14 suggests that if the temperature increases along the flow direction from to x x ρx ρx x heavy isotope enrichment occurs at the position which is comparable to the processes of evaporation while the temperature decreases along the flow direction from to x x ρx ρx x heavy isotope depletion occurs at the position which is comparable to the processes of condensation the mathematical derivation above follows the mass balance of water in a flowing system physically it was found that both temperature and pressure can induce isotropic fractionation in water due to the dependency of vibrational frequencies on pressure and temperature spectra inspection indicates that the fractionation coefficient is linearly related to the pressure 200 mpa and temperature 300 c driesner 1997 as also the density varies linearly with pressure and temperature substituting the density in eq 12 by the fractionation coefficient to consider the effects of pressure and temperature explicitly the same r values can be obtained for the purpose of achieving acceptable computational efficiencies for large two or three dimensional domains the isotope module established here does not consider detailed chemical reaction processes between water and minerals that might influence isotopic exchanges although complex rock water interactions are a strength of the tough family of codes i e toughreact xu et al 2006 implementation of a full blown reactive transport module also requires availability of detailed mineralogical and pore water composition to build a site specific geochemical model such data is often not available as was the case in this study with only limited mineralogical data defined table 2 instead we used the kinetic rate of reaction approach from cole and chakraborty 2001 to describe the isotopic changes in water as induced by chemical reactions at elevated temperatures brikowski 2001 fekete et al 2018 these first order simplifications are an acceptable approach when the purpose is to explore the importance of various coupled processes in determining the spatiotemporal distribution of stable isotopes in a geothermal groundwater system in addition we here focus on the isotope changes in the subsurface and the influence of processes on the land surface e g evaporation are not considered 3 model implementation and testing 3 1 site description the zhacang geothermal field in the qinghai province china is located in the central guide basin northeastern tibetan plateau fig 2 the temperature anomaly 60 c at the zhacang spring rs11 has attracted geothermal exploration campaigns in the guide basin since 2011 two wells zr1 and rs7 were drilled and the outflow temperatures of both wells exceed 90 c at depths of about 200 m the finalized depth of zr1 is 3000 m which revealed hot granite with a temperature of 150 c considering this high temperature condition a pilot experimental site is scheduled to be established at the zhacang geothermal field to jointly exploit geothermal energy stored in hot wet and dry rock 3 2 data collection and geothermal processes analysis to understand the geothermal processes at the zhacang geothermal field groundwater samples were collected from springs rs3 and rs11 and artesian wells well zr1 had a single screen from 50 m to 1500 m and was uncased from 1500 m to 3000 m depth while rs7 had a single screen from 70 m to 200 m rainwaters in the guide basin in two rain events in august 2015 rain 1 to 2016 rain 2 were also collected respectively we measured the isotopes δd δ18o 3he 4he 87sr 86sr in these water samples and the mineral composition of rock samples collected along a depth profile from 203 to 2400 m below surface from drillhole zr1 tables 1 and 2 however it is noted that the isotope compositions measured in the water samples collected in recharge area e g rain 1 and rain 2 rs3 represent the values in summer which likely do not fully represent the isotope compositions in recharge water thus the isotope composition in recharge water is a variable to adjust in section 3 4 the hydrogeochemical analysis and numerical modelling of heat and fluid transport previously reported by jiang et al 2018b concluded that the geothermal water at the zhacang geothermal field is initially recharged by the surface water from the gangyi stream which flows west to east and nearly parallel to fault f2 fig 2c recharge into the subsurface occurs via the normal fault f2 while discharge is observed at the zhacang spring rs11 where the reverse fault f5 provides for a barrier to horizontal flow forcing upward fluid flow along the fault damage zone fig 2 3he 4he isotope ratio in the thermal water indicates that the thermal anomaly in the zhacang geothermal field can be attributed to heat produced from depths 3000 m and that the heat generated by u and th decay in the depth 3000 m is negligible jiang et al 2018b the 87sr 86sr value of 0 7143 suggests a water granodiorite granite interaction along the flow paths water rock interaction mainly between water and silica feldspar has induced δ18o enrichment jiang et al 2018b it was previously demonstrated that the δ18o in groundwater can be altered by reaction between water and minerals including silica feldspar and co2 carbonate rocks johnson et al 2011 karolytė et al 2017 while δd can be altered by chemical reactions between water and hydrous minerals e g hornblende and biotite godfrey 1962 in this site as is evident from table 2 there is little calcite in the reservoir rocks and the geothermal waters are of the na cl type therefore δ18o changes due to water co2 carbonate rocks are considered unimportant while δ18o changes due to reaction between water silica and feldspar are accounted for in our simulation in addition the influence of isotope exchange between water and rock on the δd value is neglected as the amount of hydrous minerals is relatively small in granite according to the xrd analysis on rock samples table 2 3 3 model conceptualization based on the geothermal conditions at the zhacang geothermal field we numerically simulated the evolution of δd and δ18o values in groundwater with temperatures ranging from 5 c snow melting temperature to 150 c temperature measured in the drillhole zr1 at the bottom of the fault zone the assumed vertically conductive fault f2 occurred over a distance of approximately 2500 m in the granite and granodiorite fig 2a the lateral recharge from the host rock in the direction orthogonal to the fault plane to the fault zone is assumed very limited owing to the low permeability of the surrounding rock hence a zero flux boundary condition was imposed along the two vertical boundaries i e fault face a two dimensional vertical slab model is constructed to simulate the fluid heat isotope transport in the hydraulically conductive fault f2 which has a length of 2500 m x depth of 3000 m y and width of 20 m z figs 3 a and 2 the model domain is discretized into 3000 elements with the size of each element equal to 50 m 20 m 50 m we tested that further refinement of the elements did not alter the results significantly although the computation time increased largely fig 4 a the magnitude of the time step is automatically adjusted in tough2 according to the user defined iteration convergence the boundary conditions and the parameters for fluid i e total water flux including liquid and vapor phase and heat transport are summarized in fig 3a according to the 2015 2016 field investigations fig 2 water is recharged from the west side of the fault over a distance of 500 m and discharged along a 200 m long section at the east model boundary the recharge rate is equal to the maximum stream flow rate 1 25 kg s comparable to the discharge rate in discharge zone observed along the fault f2 which completely infiltrates into the fault within a distance of 500 m fig 2d the pressure at the discharge zone is assigned to be at one atmosphere pressure to represent the artesian wells and springs a constant temperature of 5 c representing the local average atmospheric temperature is assigned in the recharge area while a zero temperature gradient boundary condition is set at nodes where water leaves the domain allowing the water to be discharged without heat loss to be consistent with the observed temperature logs in drillhole zr1 a constant temperature of 150 c is given at the fault bottom a zero fluid flux boundary is set at both left and right model boundaries as the hydraulic conductivity in the granite beyond the fault zone is assumed to be very low a zero heat flux is assumed on both left and right sides of the fault as there is no lateral water flux to drive heat convection and the heat conduction via the side boundary is far less than that via the fault bottom and therefore has a negligible influence on the temperature in the fault zone the rationale for boundary conditions for heat and fluid transport was discussed in our companion paper jiang et al 2018a under the flow and heat boundary conditions above the calculated temperature in zr1 fits with the observations when the permeability is adjusted to 50 md fig 3b jiang et al 2018b a maximum error of 7 c occurs at 1200 m this is attributed to the heterogeneous lithology distribution in the real situation which in this model is assumed to be fractured granite with a uniform permeability we hereafter focus on the isotope behaviour in the subsurface zone with a homogeneous permeability in this hydrogeothermal system the spatiotemporal variation of δd in water is induced by advection dispersion and possibly fractionation during phase changes of water in contrast δ18o could also enrich in the geothermal system due to interactions between water and minerals silica and feldspar in granite which is quantified by the reaction rate constant krl diffusion coefficients fractionation factors and the reaction rate constant depend on the temperature all of which are summarized in table 3 3 4 sensitivity analysis and isotope model adjustment since the boundary conditions and parameters controlling the fluid and heat processes were determined in our previous works jiang et al 2018a jiang et al 2018b we here investigate the sensitivity of isotope composition taking δ18o as an example in drillhole zr1 at the discharge zone to additional uncertainty factors these include the reaction rate constant krl between h2 18o and granite which ranges from 0 to 10 7 1 s up to temperatures of 300 c cole and chakraborty 2001 and the dispersivity considering the range between 0 and 150 m voss 1984 the sensitivity analysis was carried out using three levels of each parameter minimum best estimate and maximum value in a factorial design approach yielding nine parameter combinations moreover although the isotope composition in the recharge water was measured in summer rainwater and rs3 in table 1 it changes with temperature it was reported that δ18o in rainwater and snowmelt water near this current study area ranges from 24 40 in late winter or in cold paleoclimate to 2 80 in rainwater in summer respectively cui and li 2015 the sensitivity of the isotope composition in the discharge water in well zr1 to that in recharge water is analyzed as well in this case both dispersivity and reaction rate constant were kept at zero as shown in fig 5 δ18o in the discharge water increases with both δ18o in recharge water and reaction rate constant fig 5a and c when the reaction rate constant exceeds 10 11 the δ18o enriched in water becomes larger than that in granite and the δ18o in water stabilizes at a value of 10 fig 5c which is equal to that assigned in granite we here assume an irreversible reaction processes from granite to water without considering the re deposition of silica and assume that the δ18o in minerals is higher than that in water varying the dispersivity has a negligible influence on the δ18o in the discharge water when compared to the influence of previous two factor fig 5b and d the reason for this is that in this geothermal system the heat and isotope transport are mainly controlled by advection and the dispersion processes is weak the relationship between δd in the discharge water and that in recharge water and dispersivity is similar to that of δ18o the effect of dispersivity is equally weak as it was for δ18o while δd changes due to water rock interaction are neglected in this work following the results of the sensitivity analysis the uncertain δd value in the recharge water in the range below 42 δd measured in the summer rainwater in table 1 is adjusted until the calculated δd value in zr1 agrees with the observed values fig 6 a the water samples representing discharge from the fault zone were collected from a thermal spring and artesian wells table 1 with water in the wells assumed to be well mixed due to strong convection along the well bore note that the flow and heat processes in the wellbore are not simulated separately in this study and the influence of heterogeneity on the water flux into the well is not considered therefore a flux weighted average of the calculated δd values along the entire vertical profile at zr1 fig 3 is compared to the observed values in water samples from springs and boreholes table 1 to obtain the natural distribution of δd in the fault f2 the model is run until pressure temperature and isotope ratio reach a quasi steady state i e pressure and temperature fluctuate regularly due to the flow driven by gravity and buoyancy force see jiang et al 2018b and average isotope ratio is relatively stable the initial δd values in the model domain are arbitrarily given as 100 this assumption does not affect the stabilized isotope composition in the system fig 4b as the initial water composition in the system is gradually replaced by the recharge water when δd in recharge water is adjusted to 79 δd varies nonlinearly in zr1 in the range of 88 to 83 with an average value of 83 8 fig 6a this average value agrees well with δd measured in the thermal water collected at the zhacang geothermal field table 1 this estimated δd in recharge water is depleted by 15 relative to the values measured in spring rs3 64 in summer suggesting the thermal water is recharged in cold season or by snow melting water moreover it is found that the isotope compositions in discharge waters vary across the discharge area fig 8c in zr1 x 2500 m the average δd is lighter than that in the recharge water while at the position of x 2300 m average δd can reach 74 3 which is 4 7 heavier than that in recharge water the mechanism of spatial variation of heavy isotope composition is further explained in section 4 2 δ18o value in recharge water was subsequently determined to be 11 9 from the optimized δd value following the local meteoric water line δd 6 9δ18o 3 3 tan et al 2012 according to the relationship between temperature and δ18o in the northeastern tibetan plateau δ18o 0 567 t 14 27 tian et al 2003 the recharge temperature for δ18o of 11 9 is estimated at 4 c which aligns with the recharge temperature of 5 c used in the heat flow model to fit the temperature in zr1 with observations fig 3 since the stable isotope ratio in recharge water is estimated the reaction rate constant k rl is adjusted manually to fit the observed δ18o value in the water sample collected from zr1 when the average k rl over the entire model domain is equal to 9 5 10 13 1 s corresponding to a 0 9 10 13 1 s the mean of δ18o in zr1 is estimated at 10 8 which matches the observations in the spring and water well table 1 the reaction between water and minerals in granite results in δ18o in zr1 to enrich by approximately 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 δd and δ18o in a fault zone under high temperature fig 7 illustrates four snapshots 10 days 1100 years 1600 years and 2300 years of temperature δd and δ18o distribution in the fault f2 it is observed that δd and δ18o distributions are more complex than that of temperature the temperature generally increases from west to east in the horizontal direction and decreases with the depth in the vertical direction a different trend is observed for stable isotopes in the horizontal distance between 2200 and 2500 m which decreases towards the west both heat and isotope transports are controlled by advection and dispersion however the isotope composition can vary with the fractionation during phase changes of water and the coefficients for advection and dispersion for isotope transport depend on the fluid density eq 9 which changes with temperature at the zhacang geothermal field temperature at the fault bottom is 150 c which is too low for phase changes to occur it is demonstrated in fig 8 that the phase changes occur when the maximum system temperature exceeds 180 c in this given model domain therefore the different patterns between isotope and temperature distribution at a distance between 2200 and 2500 m must be influenced by fluid density this indicates that isotope fractionation not only occurs with phase change but it also exists between waters with different densities 4 2 density effects on the isotope distribution to further clarify the mechanism of density effects on the isotope distribution in the geothermal system δd values are calculated in two different ways in the first approach density effects on the isotope compositions are neglected in the second approach the effect of fluid density on isotope ratio is explicitly considered approach 1 a numerical model is established based on governing eqs 1 and 2 which uses the concentration of hdo in water as a variable the hdo concentration in the recharge water is estimated at 0 1534 kg m3 corresponding to a δd value of 80 r of 1 45 10 4 r ref of 1 58 10 4 density of 1000 kg m3 and λ between hdo and h2o of 19 18 in eqs 4 and 11 once the partial differential equations for the temperature pressure density and concentration are solved the hdo concentration is converted to the δd value based on eqs 4 and 11 at the end of calculation in this case the influence of temporal variation of density on the isotope changes is neglected fig 8a and b approach 2 using the isotope ratio r as a variable the isotope distribution in the geothermal system is described by eq 8 and 10 the r value in recharge water is given as 1 45 10 4 corresponding to a δd value of 80 in this case r and fluid density are calculated simultaneously at each time step and the influence of fluid density on r is addressed fig 8a and c both approaches are explored with our new model before discussing the differences between approach 1 and 2 a model inter comparison is undertaken to verify the correctness of the numerical implementation of the new isotope module using feflow the verification was done only for approach 1 because feflow does not account for the coupling between fluid density and isotope ratio approach 2 feflow is a groundwater modelling software able to solve fluid heat and solute transport equations based on the finite element method diersch 2013 results for approach 1 show that during the period from initial state to the steady state δd values in drillhole zr1 calculated by the new isotope module are comparable to the feflow results for bottom temperatures from 50 c to 150 c as the maximum temperature allowed in feflow is 150 c fig 8a this gives confidence that the convection dispersion equation has been properly implemented in the isotope module the δd values resulting from feflow are slightly higher because feflow calculates density based on temperature only while in tough2 the density is related to both temperature and pressure in the subsurface system the discussion now continues with a comparison between approach 1 and 2 as shown in fig 8b δd values increase from the recharge area towards the discharge area under approach 1 which however does not fully address the processes of isotope fractionation between fluids with different densities eq 4 implies a negative relationship between the heavy isotope ratio and density the heavy isotope can enrich as the density decreases at high temperature this cannot happen in a closed system rather it should occur in an open and flowing system for instance where the increase of temperature in one cell the mesh element after domain discretization leads to the water expanding and flowing to another cell as the mobility of a heavy isotope is weaker than that of a light isotope more light isotopes move out and the heavy isotope enrichment occurs in other words the difference in the mobility between heavy isotopes in low density fluid and high density fluid i e the circumstances with different temperatures and pressures can induce isotope fractionation however using approach 1 the isotope ratio is indeed calculated in a static sense merely by removing the density from the end state isotope concentration based on eq 4 in a closed cell in contrast using approach 2 the isotope ratio and density are calculated simultaneously in the flow system for example at position 1 in fig 8c assuming the same initial isotope ratio in two cells fig 8d gravity driven advection from cooler areas with high density fluid to warmer areas with low density fluid leads to isotope enrichment along the flow path from upstream to the downstream eq 14 at position 2 temperature differences causes density driven flow in a reverse direction which brings the enriched heavy isotope back towards the upstream positions which is a process comparable to the water condensation from vapor phase to liquid phase when this dynamic system reaches a steady state a non monotonic δd pattern in space is obtained with the heavy isotope enriching near the discharge area in this case at x 2300 m and depleting towards both downstream and upstream zones in the horizontal direction in the vertical direction the highest δd occurs at the depth about 1200 m and depletes towards both shallower and deeper zone fig 6a due to the density effects δd values in the discharge water are likely going to be different from that in the recharge water owing to the isotopic fractionation occurring in the geothermal system when the maximum system temperature ranges from 50 c to 180 c phase changes do not occur and the δd values in the discharge area can be different from that in the recharge water by less than 10 however when the maximum temperature becomes higher than 180 c based on the model discussed in this study phase changes occur near the land surface in the discharge zone which leads to further enrichment of the heavy isotope in the discharging water the δd enrichment between discharged water and recharge water at the temperature of 220 c can reach 30 however most δd values measured in the water samples collected in the discharge area are not only representative of deep circulation water but also mix with water from recharge areas exhibiting shorter flow paths thus the observable difference between δd values in the discharge water collected on the land surface and recharge water is often lower than that predicted in this model and is dependent on the sampling positions fig 8c 4 3 summary fig 9 further illustrates the coupled processes of heat flow and isotope transport in fault f2 as shown in fig 9a two flow systems appear in the hydraulically conductive zone of f2 in the left hand side the infiltration of cool water from the recharge area in the west leads to the downward fluid flow driven by gravity force while in right hand side the density contrast due to the temperature variation can result in an upward density driven fluid flow induced by buoyancy force the influences of both gravity and density driven flow results in the concave pattern of isotope composition with depth seen in fig 6 we arbitrarily select one flow path in both flow systems and trace δd and δ18o variations along the flow paths as can be seen in fig 9b a comprehensive evolution process of δd and δ18o is displayed above the land surface δd and δ18o values in recharge water of this geothermal system are estimated at 79 and 11 9 respectively which is depleted by about 30 and 4 respectively when compared to the isotopic composition in rainwater collected in summer table 2 the isotope composition in the recharge water corresponds to a recharge temperature of about 4 c which represents snowmelt water recharge or recharge in a cold climate once the recharge water infiltrates into the subsurface zone δ18o increases by 8 due to water rock interactions and δd also increases slightly due to advection and dispersion the variability of δd in the high temperature flow system in the east is greater than the flow system in the west due to the influence of the density contrast at higher temperature in summary density variations in high temperature systems could lead to multiple flow systems with isotope fractionation happening in the same water bearing formation as an example at the zhacang geothermal field two flow systems appear in the hydraulically conductive zone of f2 where water discharging from the well zr1 is indirectly related to the recharge water in the west this suggests that without a coupled model of flow heat and isotope fractionation processes the use of environmental tracers such as stable isotopes of water for the understanding of coupled heat water flow in conductive faults under a geothermal regime may be limited 5 conclusions we developed a coupled fluid heat isotope transport module as an add on to the tough2 simulator which can be applied to simulate δd and δ18o in groundwater with temperature ranging from atmosphere temperature to 300 c the transport model considered the isotope changes induced by advection dispersion water rock interaction and fractionation induced by water density changes and phase shift the model was implemented in the guide basin china to simulate the co evolution of temperature pressure and δd and δ18o values in a geothermal system with flow being controlled by a geological fault the δd change in the guide basin geothermal system is mainly the result of advective and dispersive transport while the δ18o change is further controlled by water rock interactions importantly the high degree of temperature variation leads to an upward density driven flow which creates two flow systems in the hydraulically conductive fault zone and promotes further isotopic changes in the hydrogeothermal system moreover the variation of density affects advection and dispersion coefficients as a consequence a fractionation phenomenon appears between the low and high density fluid for a system with temperatures above 50 c the influence of fluid density differences on isotope composition changes is considerable and it affects the isotopic condition of discharge waters as a result the isotope composition in the discharged groundwater can be used to infer details about subsurface processes such inference however requires use of a coupled model of heat fluid isotope transport as dis cussed here acknowledgement funding support for this study was provided by the national natural science
