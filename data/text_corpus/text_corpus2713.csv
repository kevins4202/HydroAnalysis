13565,the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process was evaluated for the removal of chemical oxygen demand cod and color from healthcare wastewater a 2 level full factorial design with center points was created to investigate the effect of the process parameters i e initial cod h2o2 ph reaction time and current density furthermore the total energy consumption and average current efficiency in the system were evaluated predictive models for cod color removal and energy consumption were obtained the initial cod and ph were found to be the most significant variables in the reduction of cod and color in peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process hydrogen peroxide only has a significant effect on the treated wastewater when combined with other input variables in the process like ph reaction time and current density in the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process current density appears not as a single effect but rather as an interaction effect with h2o2 in reducing cod and color lower energy expenditure was observed at higher initial cod shorter reaction time and lower current density the average current efficiency was found as low as 13 and as high as 777 overall the study showed that hybrid electrochemical oxidation can be applied effectively and efficiently for the removal of pollutants from healthcare wastewater keywords electrochemical oxidation uv hydrogen peroxide healthcare pollutants removal factorial design 1 introduction healthcare wastewater hcww contains a variety of persistent and toxic substances that can cause a chemical biological and physical risk for public and environmental health these pollutants mostly include partially metabolized pharmaceuticals hazardous liquid waste from several units anesthetics disinfectants formaldehyde glutaraldehyde heavy metals radioactive waste detergents biodegradable organic material recalcitrant organic material and pathogenic microorganisms 1 3 these contaminants in wastewater may represent healthcare facilities as an unquestionable release source of several toxic and persistent substances in the aquatic environment 4 7 and cause many environmental hazards 8 9 these pollutants are commonly classified based on their detected concentrations as micropollutants 10 6 to10 3 mg l 1 or macropollutants 10 3 mg l 1 and the majority has no regulatory status 10 referring to the presence of macro and emerging micropollutants the bod5 cod and suspended solids ss of healthcare wastewater are two to three times higher than urban wastewaters 1 moreover higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals were found in hospital effluents than those found in urban wastewaters 11 12 a review work of verlicchi et al 13 reported that concentrations of micropollutants e g pharmaceuticals in hcwws are between 4 and 150 times higher than in urban wastewaters the range of some pharmaceuticals concentration measured in healthcare facilities effluent of three geographic regions asia europe and north america is presented in table s1 adapted from verlicchi et al 10 the water consumption rates in healthcare facilities range between 200 and 1200 l bed day for low income and high income countries respectively 14 these water consumption rates in healthcare facilities give significant volumes of wastewater emerging contaminants present in healthcare wastewater tend to be not removed as intended during the conventional sewage treatment process which typically relies on biological treatment 15 16 besides the disinfectants bactericides present in wastewater have the potential to inhibit the biological processes involved in wastewater treatment 17 thus the inefficiency of conventional water treatments in destroying biorecalcitrant contaminants has promoted the search for more potent methods 18 studies indicate that advanced oxidation processes aops are efficient novel methods for the removal of emerging contaminants from water and wastewater 19 23 the common feature of aops is the in situ production of hydroxyl radicals as the main oxidizing agents in the treatment process these have the second strongest oxidizing power after fluorine with a standard reduction potential of e o h h2o 2 8 v she 18 the electrochemical advanced oxidation process which is one among a great variety of aops is drawing attention as a result of their effectiveness in the removal of pollutants and their complete mineralization 24 26 the combination of electrochemistry with the photo uv is a hybrid technique for the removal of recalcitrant compounds from wastewater 27 the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process is one of the electrochemical processes that was investigated for the removal of cod from pharmaceutical wastewater in a few studies 28 29 the major parameters affecting the effectiveness of this process are the operating conditions such as the initial cod ph reaction time current density anode materials and electrolyte concentration 30 32 monitoring of these parameters in wastewater treatment processes plays a decisive role to enhance the system s performance in the removal of pollutants in the present work the influence of five operational parameters in the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation ppe process was evaluated for the removal of cod and color from healthcare wastewater the effect of initial cod of the healthcare wastewater the amount of hydrogen peroxide added ph reaction time and current density and their synergistic and antagonistic interactions were assessed a predictive model for cod and color removal was suggested furthermore the total energy consumption and average current efficiency in the system were evaluated and the main factors and their interactions were determined 2 methods and materials 2 1 sampling healthcare wastewater was collected from the septic tank effluent of jimma university teaching hospital using a clean plastic container jerrycan jimma university teaching hospital is located in the southwestern part of ethiopia providing services for approximately 160 000 outpatient attendants 15 000 inpatients 4 500 deliveries and 11 000 emergency cases in a year coming to the hospital from the catchment population of about 15 million people 33 the collected 50 l sample was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c until the experiment was ended the sample was filtered using glass microfibre filters grade 934 ah before feeding to the reactor for each run of the experiments to target the dissolved cod 2 2 experimental setup the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process was carried out in a batch experiment of the electrochemical reactor with a capacity of 1 l the reactor was equipped with two stainless steel electrodes each having a 28 cm2 surface area anode and cathode besides two additional stainless steel plates with the same dimensions were placed between the electrodes bipolar series configuration to improve coagulation the inter electrode distances were 50 mm the batch experimental setup is presented schematically in fig 1 as it has been used in our previous work 28 the wastewater collected was filtered using a 1 5 μm glass microfiber filter grade 934 ah before being fed to the electrocoagulation cell the initial cod after filtration was measured the purpose of the filtration was to retain suspended solids from the wastewater and to target the dissolved cod for the experiments the irradiation was carried out with a uvc lamp 6 w connected which was placed above the reactor at 15 cm from the wastewater in all experiments in each run 1000 ml of healthcare wastewater was fed to the electrolytic cell the reactor was placed on a magnetic stirrer maintained at 250 rpm to disperse coagulant matter in the reactor efficiently and to ensure homogeneity the ph was monitored by using the ph 3310 from xylem analytics germany gmbh adjusted to the required level using naoh 0 1 m and h2so4 0 1 m at the end of each experiment the treated wastewater was filtered using a 1 5 μm glass microfiber filter before analysis the cod was measured by a titrimetric method after sample digestion using dichromate as the oxidant in an acidic solution at 150 c for 2 h 34 according to the beer lambert law the color of the wastewater before and after treatment was measured by using bibby scientific jenway 6700 model spectrophotometer the absorbance of the sample for each treatment runs was measured at maximum absorbance λmax after calibration has been made with deionized water for zero absorbance 2 3 analysis 2 3 1 cod and color removal the percentage of cod removal in the solution is determined using eq 1 1 cod cod0 codt cod0 x 100 where cod0 and codt are the chemical oxygen demand at the initial time t 0 and at reaction time t respectively the absorbance of the sample wastewater before treatment and the treated samples were measured by using a spectrophotometer for the corresponding wavelength λmax and the percentage color removal was calculated for each experimental run using the eq 2 2 color a0 at a0 x 100 where a0 and at are absorbance at time t 0 and at reaction time t respectively 2 3 2 current efficiency and energy consumption the average current efficiency ace represents an average value of current efficiency between the initial time t 0 and t it can be computed as follows 35 3 ace cod0 codt 8it fv where cod0 and codt mg l 1 correspond to cod of wastewater at t 0 and t t in s respectively i is the current a f is the faraday constant 96 487 c mol v is the volume of the wastewater m3 and 8 is the equivalent mass of oxygen g eq 1 the specific energy consumption was calculated for each experimental run by eq 4 4 es 1000u i t cod0 codt v where es is the specific energy consumption kwh kgcod 1 u is the voltage v i is the current a t is the reaction time h cod0 and codt are the initial and final cod of wastewater mg l 1 and v is the volume of the wastewater l the electrical energy consumed by uv irradiation is also important to consider in the wastewater treatment operating cost this was calculated using the light power irradiated p 6 w using the following equation eq 5 36 5 eem p t1000 cod0 codt v where eem is electric energy per mass required to decay a unit mass of a contaminant cod in polluted water kwh kgcod 1 p is the rated power kw t is the reaction time h cod0 and codt are the initial and final cod of wastewater mg l 1 and v is the volume of the wastewater l then the total energy consumed in the system was calculated by summing up both types of energy consumptions as 6 et es eem where et is the total energy consumption kwh kgcod 1 2 4 design of experiments a 2 level full factorial design with center points was created to investigate the effect of the main process parameters i e initial cod h2o2 ph reaction time and current density for response variables of cod and color removal efficiencies and energy consumption table 1 a total of 37 experiments was performed center points were added to provide a measure of process stability and to check for curvature 37 generally add approximately 3 5 center point runs to a full or fractional factorial design recommended as a rough guide 37 3 results and discussion for comparison five experimental variables initial cod of the healthcare wastewater the amount of hydrogen peroxide added ph reaction time and current density were selected in the multivariable experimental design this rotatable experimental plan was carried out with the full factorial design which consisted of 37 experiments determined by the expression n 2k c0 where n is the total number of experiments required k is the number of variables and c0 is the number of center point runs table 2 shows all the conducted experiments in the full factorial design with 5 center points the levels for each variable 1 0 and 1 signs correspond to the low center and high values of the variables respectively response of percentage cod and color removal ace and energy consumption 3 1 model development and validation a full factorial experimental design was implemented to identify the statistically significant individual variables on the response and the two and higher order interactions were made using the statistical package jmp pro 15 the effect of model terms with low significance p value 0 05 was removed from the models to construct as simple as possible models that can accurately describe the process within the range of conditions that the experiments have been performed in the removing of model terms has been done one at a time by starting from the model term with the highest p value by keeping an eye on the regression coefficients value r2 while removing insignificant terms from the full models the r2 was reduced from 0 96 to 0 88 0 99 to 0 96 0 95 to 0 83 for cod removal color removal and energy consumption respectively for the case of energy consumption the last two interaction terms i e reaction time with current density and initial cod with reaction time were kept in the model despite their insignificant p values to maintain the r2 value of 0 8 the resulting reduced models can still describe the process adequately as evidenced by the experimental and predicted value as well as the anova analysis the comparison between experimental and predicted values are in good agreement for obtained reduced models of all responses fig 2 a c this determined by the higher regression coefficients r2 following the recommendation from a statistician 38 the r2 value that satisfies the condition r2 0 8 in fig 2a c the experimental values were presented in y axes and x axes were for corresponding predicted values the data were fitted to equation y ax b for all response variables the regression coefficients of determination were greater than 0 8 which indicated satisfactory predictions additionally the anova analysis showed that all the three models were significant table s2 and can be used to predict the of cod removal color removal and energy consumption the effect summary from tables 3 5 includes a threshold value for detecting the most important terms for the cod and color removal and energy consumption which is shown as a vertical blue line on the logworth horizontal bar chart the vertical blue line in the plot is set at the value 2 a logworth that exceeds 2 is significant at the 0 01 level for the cod removal model table 3 the effect summary horizontal bar chart illustrates that the effects are significant at the 0 01 and 0 05 levels in this model there are two main effects i e the effect of each variable on the response that are significant i e initial cod and ph also the first order interaction of initial cod with reaction time and hydrogen peroxide with three main effects namely ph reaction time and current density is significant the second order interactions of initial cod hydrogen peroxide and ph were also significant in the model furthermore the interaction of four input variables was found significant namely initial cod hydrogen peroxide ph and reaction time in terms of the mass of cod removed for the color removal model table 4 eleven and five model terms are significant at the 0 01 and 0 05 levels respectively this partially reduced model of color removal shows that the initial cod ph and reaction time are the three main effects that have a significant influence on color reduction from the treated wastewater this model with the 16 terms also indicates that interactions have a significant influence the first order interaction of color removal model shows that hydrogen peroxide has a significant interaction effect with all other input variables in the model besides the ph with current density and with reaction time rt has a significant interaction with a p value less than 0 01 the model also illustrates that the second order interaction of four terms namely h2o2 ph and rt h2o2 rt and current density initial cod h2o2 and current density h2o2 ph and current density has a significant influence in reducing color from the treated wastewater like in the first order interaction of this model hydrogen peroxide played a major role in second order interaction too by interacting with the other two input variable in reducing color four and five factors interactions were also observed in this model table 4 with a significant level p value 0 05 in the model of energy consumption eight model terms have a significant effect table 5 that were evaluated by p values smaller than 0 05 in this case seen from table 5 the first three terms were very highly significant because the p values were as low as 0 01 namely initial cod current density and the interaction effect of both effects the energy consumption for the treatment of the wastewater was also influenced by another main effect i e rt and by first order interaction i e h2o2 with ph rt with current density and initial cod with rt and second order interaction i e initial cod h2o2 and ph at a significant level of 0 05 the estimates of the suggested model that describes cod removal color removal and energy consumption are presented in table 6 3 2 effect of operating parameters the efficiency of the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process as a function of various factors with the combination of low and high levels resulted in a range of output on the response variables table 2 the result obtained from 37 experiment runs shows that the percentage removal of cod and color ranges 16 8 82 86 and 18 52 89 81 respectively the studied operating parameters that govern these removals are discussed in this section 3 2 1 effect of initial cod the organic pollutant concentrations and their nature strongly affect the efficiency of an electrochemical treatment process 27 30 different cod concentrations of healthcare wastewater were used for this study that ranges from 70 mg l 1 to 280 mg l 1 as can be seen in the prediction profiler fig 3 a better removal of cod and color from the healthcare wastewater was observed as the initial cod increased from 70 mg l 1to 280 mg l 1 besides this as it has been observed in table 2 interesting to compare cod removal obtained at different initial cod concentrations while all other variables are common and observed that the percentage removal is dependent on the initial cod concentration for instance runs 5 and 34 6 and 37 7 and 29 10 and 35 and 13 and 15 the higher the initial cod the higher the fraction of its removal in the cod and color removal models table 6 it was observed that the three term interaction i e initial cod h2o2 and ph and the two term interaction i e initial cod and h2o2 are positive respectively i e an increase in their value increases the response therefore for better cod and color removal the initial cod concentration must be in line with the amount of h2o2 added this can be elucidated by the scavenging effect of the excess h2o2 the free o h radicals generated in the system have an equal probability to be scavenged by the excess h2o2 or to attack the pollutants when the excess h2o2 goes for reacting with the free radicals as described in eq 7 that generate less reactive radicals like perhydroxyl ho 2 consequently the removal efficiency at lower initial cod reduces this may not be the case while using the higher concentration range of initial cod for instance 1000 5000 mg l 1 as reported in the research work of asaithambi et al 2020 in summary with the stated experimental concentration range of initial cod the oxidizing efficiency was increased with the concentration of initial cod 7 h2o2 oh ho 2 h2o 3 2 2 effect of initial ph when it comes to electrocoagulation ph is a key parameter as it affects the conductivity of the solution electrode dissolution and zeta potential 39 this study was conducted using different ph values ranging from 3 to 9 the ph value for each experimental run was adjusted by using either sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid as required depending on the combination of operational parameters with varying quantities different removal efficiencies were obtained for given ph value for the partially reduced model of cod removal it was shown that ph and initial cod are the main effects that play a significant role in reducing cod table 3 the prediction profiler also shows that how the removal efficiency of cod and color affected as ph changes fig 3 illustrates that as ph increases from 3 to 9 the cod and color removal also increased the slope of the black line the vertical red lines correspond to the current value of the factors the current value of each factor is also shown in red below the horizontal axis the red value on the vertical axis is the predicted response based on the current values of the factors these results are supported by the findings of lakshmanan and clifford 2009 this study conducted an experimental analysis of iron electrocoagulation at different ph ranges the generated fe2 during iron electrolysis undergoes oxidation in the presence of dissolved oxygen and a suitable ph around 8 5 to form fe3 that is finally hydrolyzed to form insoluble fe oh 3 s feooh s other studies also indicated that ferrous ions are only oxidized to ferric ions if the ph is above 5 41 42 it is therefore moving the ph value from low to high fig 3 shows better removal of cod and color from the treated healthcare wastewater as of better sweep flocculation 3 2 3 effect of h2o2 concentration the effect of h2o2 concentration is a critical issue in peroxi photoelectrocoagulation the addition of h2o2 further enhances the generation of hydroxyl radicals through the reaction with ferrous ions eq 8 the ferrous ions are regenerated by their reduction at the cathode surface eq 9 18 besides the presence of uv light in the system leads to the photolytic cleavage of h2o2 into two o h as described in eq 10 8 h2o2 fe2 fe3 oh oh 9 fe3 e fe2 10 h2o2 hv 2 oh for the present study h2o2 with three concentration levels of 150 225 and 300 mg l 1 was used at different experimental runs as can be seen in partially reduced models of cod and color removal tables 3 and 4 h2o2 played a significant role when interacting with other input variables i e initial cod ph rt current density than as a single effect this might be due to the characteristics of h2o2 it is a weak acid with relatively high oxidation potential e 1 77 v which alone does not lead to the generation of o h 43 the slow reaction rates make the process ineffective eqs 11 13 43 fig 4 displays the first order interaction of h2o2 with ph for cod and color removal respectively the two dimension contour plots of fig 4 illustrate the higher percentage of the cod and color were removed while lower level h2o2 interact with higher level ph this observation shows that the higher removal of cod and color is due to sweep flocculation than the fenton reaction in this system furthermore h2o2 is only effective for the treatment of the wastewater when combined with other input variables in the process like ph rt and current density 11 h2o2 ho2 h 12 h2o2 h2o ½ o2 13 h2o2 ho2 h2o o2 oh 3 2 4 effect of reaction time the reaction time has an important influence on the treatment efficiency and for economic applicability of the electrochemical process 44 in the present study the highest reaction time used was 60 min while the lowest was 30 min it was observed that rt as a single effect has a significant influence on the reduction of color table 6 and as interaction effects with h2o2 and ph fig 5 for the removal of cod rt has a significant combined effect while interacting with h2o2 and initial cod fig 6 in fig 6b it is shown that the amount of cod reduced more in the initial stage of the treatment time nearly 77 within 40 min and at high initial cod this might be due to the presence of excess colloids for the removal in high cod concentrations at the beginning of the treatment process 3 2 5 effect of current density current density determines the number of metal ions released from the electrodes into the bulk solution the dissociation of metal ions is directly proportional to the applied current density 39 the selection of a suitable current density is important for removal efficiency a high current density may negatively affect the system efficiency as coagulant overdosage can reverse the charge of the colloids and redistribute them and also reducing electrode lifetime and higher operating costs due to the increase in energy consumption 45 in the present study the cod and color removal efficiency of the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process was determined by applying the current density within the range of 3 5 7 ma cm 2 in the galvanostatic mode for each experimental run in the suggested model table 6 it is observed that current density has not appeared as a single effect within this experimental range but rather as an interaction effect with other main effects in reducing cod and color i e h2o2 the two dimension contour plots of fig 7 illustrate the region where the higher of the cod and color were removed while current density interacts with h2o2 this interaction shows that one of them has a low value while the other has a high value or vice versa for slightly better removal of cod and color as can be seen in the percentage value of the contour line in fig 7 this relationship between current density and h2o2 might help to reduce the cost of treatment by reducing energy consumption which is linked to current density see section 3 2 as can be seen in fig 7 lowering the current density and increasing the dose of h2o2 may still be efficient for the removal of cod and color from the wastewater this might be due to the parasitic reaction which is triggered by a high current density that decreases the oxidizing power of the system when an excess of ferrous ion reacts with the generated free oh radicals eq 14 this wasting reaction is competing with the pollutants that to be removed the sources for the concentration of a ferrous ion in the system is not only governed by the anodic dissolution of the ion but also the cathodic regeneration as can be seen in eq 9 the soluble fe3 can be cathodically reduced to fe2 and also the action of photons makes its contribution for ferrous ion concentration eqs 15 and 16 18 40 thus maintaining a suitable current density in the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process enhance the fenton reaction eq 8 by controlling the amount of ferrous ion released and by avoiding parasitic reaction eq 14 which is due to excess ferrous ion and also as can be seen in fig 7 the high current density and the low dose of h2o2 still be efficient for the removal of cod and color but in this case the mechanism involved in removal is sweep flocculation than fenton reaction as discussed in section 3 1 2 14 fe2 oh fe3 oh 3 3 energy consumption profile and average current efficiency the energy consumed to remove pollutants from the wastewater is the prime concern to assess the feasibility of electrochemical processes the total energy consumption in peroxi photoelectrocoagulation was calculated according to the mathematical expression described in eqs 4 5 and 6 table 2 shows that energy consumption ranges from 6 478 to 386 1 kw h kgcod 1 in the present study the energy consumption was affected significantly by the variables based on table 5 as single and interaction effects it was observed that current density reaction time and initial cod concentration were the obvious single effect variables to affect energy consumption the two dimension contour plots present visual results of the interactive variables influence on energy consumption fig 8 fig 8a shows that energy consumption increased linearly with rising current density and reaction time the interaction of ph and h2o2 was also observed to have a significant effect on energy expenditure fig 8b furthermore fig 8c and d show that the interaction of initial cod with current density and reaction time influence energy consumption lower energy expenditure was obtained for a shorter reaction time a smaller current density and a higher initial cod this is due to the amount of kilowatt hour kwh consumed in the system per cod load eqs 4 and 5 which is directly proportional to the current supplied and the reaction time and inversely linked to the load of the cod removed from the system the average current efficiency ace is a parameter used to determine the effect of electric current and hydraulic retention time on the rate of cod removal concerning the theoretical mass removed according to faraday s law the correlations estimated by the row wise method show that the increase in the ace increases the removal of cod and color and conversely to the energy consumption fig 9 furthermore the results of this experiment show that ace is inversely correlated to the current density and reaction time and found to be proportional to initial cod concentration fig 10 this might be because at the higher initial cod concentrations the more organic matter could be available for removal proportion to the supplied current thus there may be an effective utilization of the supplied current without waste of it the ace value in this experiment is as high as 777 table 2 than the theoretical 100 according to faraday law in calculating ace eq 3 is directly proportional to the load of the cod removed and inversely linked to the current supplied and the reaction time in ace the cod removed in the system is only evaluated based on the amount current supplied to the process and the reaction time allotted even though several mechanisms in the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process enhance the removal of cod beyond the supplied current only such as photolytic cleavage of h2o2 eq 10 photodecarboxylation of fe3 carboxylate species eq 15 promoting fe2 regeneration 18 and reductive photolysis of fe oh 2 eq 16 that catalyzes the fenton s reaction and producing additional oh 18 46 thus this might be the possible reasons for the high efficiency value of ace similar observation on high ace value is reported in the literature 35 47 15 fe oocr 2 hv fe2 co2 r 16 fe oh 2 hv fe2 oh 4 conclusions in the present study the efficiency of the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process for the treatment of healthcare wastewater was studied using five input variables initial cod of the healthcare wastewater the amount of hydrogen peroxide added ph reaction time and current density a 2 level full factorial design with 5 center points was created to investigate the effect of these parameters and the models were suggested for response variables of cod removal color removal and energy consumption in the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process the initial cod and ph were found to be the most significant variables in the reduction of cod and color increasing the ph value i e from 3 to 9 shows better removal of cod and color from the treated healthcare wastewater with the stated experimental concentration range of initial cod the removal efficiency was increased with an increase in the concentration of initial cod and lower energy expenditure was observed at higher initial cod shorter reaction time and smaller current density the average current efficiency ace was found as high as 777 ace is inversely correlated to the current density and reaction time and was found to increase with the increase in initial cod concentration this experiment shows that hydrogen peroxide only has a significant effect on the treatment of the wastewater when combined with other input variables in the process like ph rt and current density furthermore in the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process the current density does not appear as a single effect but rather as an interaction effect with h2o2 in reducing cod and color from these observations it can be concluded that the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process could be considered as an alternative healthcare wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of

hybrid electrochemical oxidation can be applied effectively and efficiently for the removal of pollutants from healthcare wastewater keywords electrochemical oxidation uv hydrogen peroxide healthcare pollutants removal factorial design 1 introduction healthcare wastewater hcww contains a variety of persistent and toxic substances that can cause a chemical biological and physical risk for public and environmental health these pollutants mostly include partially metabolized pharmaceuticals hazardous liquid waste from several units anesthetics disinfectants formaldehyde glutaraldehyde heavy metals radioactive waste detergents biodegradable organic material recalcitrant organic material and pathogenic microorganisms 1 3 these contaminants in wastewater may represent healthcare facilities as an unquestionable release source of several toxic and persistent substances in the aquatic environment 4 7 and cause many environmental hazards 8 9 these pollutants are commonly classified based on their detected concentrations as micropollutants 10 6 to10 3 mg l 1 or macropollutants 10 3 mg l 1 and the majority has no regulatory status 10 referring to the presence of macro and emerging micropollutants the bod5 cod and suspended solids ss of healthcare wastewater are two to three times higher than urban wastewaters 1 moreover higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals were found in hospital effluents than those found in urban wastewaters 11 12 a review work of verlicchi et al 13 reported that concentrations of micropollutants e g pharmaceuticals in hcwws are between 4 and 150 times higher than in urban wastewaters the range of some pharmaceuticals concentration measured in healthcare facilities effluent of three geographic regions asia europe and north america is presented in table s1 adapted from verlicchi et al 10 the water consumption rates in healthcare facilities range between 200 and 1200 l bed day for low income and high income countries respectively 14 these water consumption rates in healthcare facilities give significant volumes of wastewater emerging contaminants present in healthcare wastewater tend to be not removed as intended during the conventional sewage treatment process which typically relies on biological treatment 15 16 besides the disinfectants bactericides present in wastewater have the potential to inhibit the biological processes involved in wastewater treatment 17 thus the inefficiency of conventional water treatments in destroying biorecalcitrant contaminants has promoted the search for more potent methods 18 studies indicate that advanced oxidation processes aops are efficient novel methods for the removal of emerging contaminants from water and wastewater 19 23 the common feature of aops is the in situ

photoelectrocoagulation process is one of the electrochemical processes that was investigated for the removal of cod from pharmaceutical wastewater in a few studies 28 29 the major parameters affecting the effectiveness of this process are the operating conditions such as the initial cod ph reaction time current density anode materials and electrolyte concentration 30 32 monitoring of these parameters in wastewater treatment processes plays a decisive role to enhance the system s performance in the removal of pollutants in the present work the influence of five operational parameters in the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation ppe process was evaluated for the removal of cod and color from healthcare wastewater the effect of initial cod of the healthcare wastewater the amount of hydrogen peroxide added ph reaction time and current density and their synergistic and antagonistic interactions were assessed a predictive model for cod and color removal was suggested furthermore the total energy consumption and average current efficiency in the system were evaluated and the main factors and their interactions were determined 2 methods and materials 2 1 sampling healthcare wastewater was collected from the septic tank effluent of jimma university teaching hospital using a clean plastic container jerrycan jimma university teaching hospital is located in the southwestern part of ethiopia providing services for approximately 160 000 outpatient attendants 15 000 inpatients 4 500 deliveries and 11 000 emergency cases in a year coming to the hospital from the catchment

electrocoagulation cell the initial cod after filtration was measured the purpose of the filtration was to retain suspended solids from the wastewater and to target the dissolved cod for the experiments the irradiation was carried out with a uvc lamp 6 w connected which was placed above the reactor at 15 cm from the wastewater in all experiments in each run 1000 ml of healthcare wastewater was fed to the electrolytic cell the reactor was placed on a magnetic stirrer maintained at 250 rpm to disperse coagulant matter in the reactor efficiently and to ensure homogeneity the ph was monitored by using the ph 3310 from xylem analytics germany gmbh adjusted to the required level using naoh 0 1 m and h2so4 0 1 m at the end of each experiment the treated wastewater was filtered using a 1 5 μm glass microfiber filter before analysis the cod was measured by a titrimetric method after sample digestion using dichromate as the oxidant in an acidic solution at 150 c for 2 h 34 according to the beer lambert law the color of the wastewater before and after treatment was measured by using bibby scientific jenway 6700 model spectrophotometer the absorbance of the sample for each treatment runs was measured at maximum absorbance λmax after calibration has been made with deionized water for zero absorbance 2 3 analysis 2 3 1 cod and color removal the percentage of cod removal in the solution is determined using eq 1 1 cod cod0 codt cod0 x 100 where cod0 and codt are the chemical oxygen demand at the initial time t 0 and at reaction time t respectively the absorbance of the sample wastewater before treatment and the treated samples were measured by using a spectrophotometer for the corresponding wavelength λmax and the percentage color removal was calculated for each experimental run using the eq 2 2 color a0 at a0 x 100 where a0 and at are absorbance at time t 0 and at reaction time t respectively 2 3 2 current efficiency and energy consumption the average current efficiency ace represents an average value of current efficiency between the initial time t 0 and t it can be computed as follows 35 3 ace cod0 codt 8it fv where cod0 and codt mg l 1 correspond to cod of wastewater at t 0 and t t in s respectively i is the current a f is the faraday constant 96 487 c mol v is the volume of the wastewater m3 and 8 is the equivalent mass of oxygen g eq 1 the specific energy consumption was calculated for each experimental run by eq 4 4 es 1000u i t cod0 codt v where es is the specific energy consumption kwh kgcod 1 u is the voltage v i is the current a t is the reaction time h cod0 and codt are the initial and final cod of wastewater mg l 1 and v is the volume of the wastewater l the electrical energy consumed by uv irradiation is also important to consider in the wastewater treatment operating cost this was calculated using the light power irradiated p 6 w using the following equation eq 5 36 5 eem p t1000 cod0 codt v where eem is electric energy per mass required to decay a unit mass of a contaminant cod in polluted water kwh kgcod 1 p is the rated power kw t is the reaction time h cod0 and codt are the initial and final cod of wastewater mg l 1 and v is the volume of the wastewater l then the total energy consumed in the system was calculated by summing up both types of energy consumptions as 6 et es eem where et is the total energy consumption kwh kgcod 1 2 4 design of experiments a 2 level full factorial design with center points was created to investigate the effect of the main process parameters i e initial cod h2o2 ph reaction time and current density for response variables of cod and color removal efficiencies and energy consumption table 1 a total of 37 experiments was performed center points were added to provide a measure of process stability and to check for curvature 37 generally add approximately 3 5 center point runs to a full or fractional factorial design recommended as a rough guide 37 3 results and discussion for comparison five experimental variables initial cod of the healthcare wastewater the amount of hydrogen peroxide added ph reaction time and current density were selected in the multivariable experimental design this rotatable experimental plan was carried out with the full factorial design which consisted of 37 experiments determined by the expression n 2k c0 where n is the total number of experiments required k is the number of variables and c0 is the number of center point runs table 2 shows all the conducted experiments in the full factorial design with 5 center points the levels for each variable 1 0 and 1 signs correspond to the low center and high values of the variables respectively response of percentage cod and color removal ace and energy consumption 3 1 model development and validation a full factorial experimental design was implemented to identify the statistically significant individual variables on the response and the two and higher order interactions were made using the statistical package jmp pro 15 the effect of model terms with low significance p value 0 05 was removed from the models to construct as simple as possible models that can accurately describe the process within the range of conditions that the experiments have been performed in the removing of model terms has been done one at a time by starting from the model term with the highest p value by keeping an eye on the regression coefficients value r2 while removing insignificant terms from the full models the r2 was reduced from 0 96 to 0 88 0 99 to 0 96 0 95 to 0 83 for cod removal color removal and energy consumption respectively for the case of energy consumption the last two interaction terms i e reaction time with current density and initial cod with reaction time were kept in the model despite their insignificant p values to maintain the r2 value of 0 8 the resulting reduced models can still describe the process adequately as evidenced by the experimental and predicted value as well as the anova analysis the comparison between experimental and predicted values are in good agreement for obtained reduced models of all responses fig 2 a c this determined by the higher regression coefficients r2 following the recommendation from a statistician 38 the r2 value that satisfies the condition r2 0 8 in fig 2a c the experimental values were presented in y axes and x axes were for corresponding predicted values the data were fitted to equation y ax b for all response variables the regression coefficients of determination were greater than 0 8 which indicated satisfactory predictions additionally the anova analysis showed that all the three models were significant table s2 and can be used to predict the of cod removal color removal and energy consumption the effect summary from tables 3 5 includes a threshold value for detecting the most important terms for the cod and color removal and energy consumption which is shown as a vertical blue line on the logworth horizontal bar chart the vertical blue line in the plot is set at the value 2 a logworth that exceeds 2 is significant at the 0 01 level for the cod removal model table 3 the effect summary horizontal bar chart illustrates that the effects are significant at the 0 01 and 0 05 levels in this model there are two main effects i e the effect of each variable on the response that are significant i e initial cod and ph also the first order interaction of initial cod with reaction time and hydrogen peroxide with three main effects namely ph reaction time and current density is significant the second order interactions of initial cod hydrogen peroxide and ph were also significant in the model furthermore the interaction of four input variables was found significant namely initial cod hydrogen peroxide ph and reaction time in terms of the mass of cod removed for the color removal model table 4 eleven and five model terms are significant at the 0 01 and 0 05 levels respectively this partially reduced model of color removal shows that the initial cod ph and reaction time are the three main effects that have a significant influence on color reduction from the treated wastewater this model with the 16 terms also indicates that interactions have a significant influence the first order interaction of color removal model shows that hydrogen peroxide has a significant interaction effect with all other input variables in the model besides the ph with current density and with reaction time rt has a significant interaction with a p value less than 0 01 the model also illustrates that the second order interaction of four terms namely h2o2 ph and rt h2o2 rt and current density initial cod h2o2 and current density h2o2 ph and current density has a significant influence in reducing color from the treated wastewater like in the first order interaction of this model hydrogen peroxide played a major role in second order interaction too by interacting with the other two input variable in reducing color four and five factors interactions were also observed in this model table 4 with a significant level p value 0 05 in the model of energy consumption eight model terms have a significant effect table 5 that were evaluated by p values smaller than 0 05 in this case seen from table 5 the first three terms were very highly significant because the p values were as low as 0 01 namely initial cod current density and the interaction effect of both effects the energy consumption for the treatment of the wastewater was also influenced by another main effect i e rt and by first order interaction i e h2o2 with ph rt with current density and initial cod with rt and second order interaction i e initial cod h2o2 and ph at a significant level of 0 05 the estimates of the suggested model that describes cod removal color removal and energy consumption are presented in table 6 3 2 effect of operating parameters the efficiency of the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process as a function of various factors with the combination of low and high levels resulted in a range of output on the response variables table 2 the result obtained from 37 experiment runs shows that the percentage removal of cod and color ranges 16 8 82 86 and 18 52 89 81 respectively the studied operating parameters that govern these removals are discussed in this section 3 2 1 effect of initial cod the organic pollutant concentrations and their nature strongly affect the efficiency of an electrochemical treatment process 27 30 different cod concentrations of healthcare wastewater were used for this study that ranges from 70 mg l 1 to 280 mg l 1 as can be seen in the prediction profiler fig 3 a better removal of cod and color from the healthcare wastewater was observed as the initial cod increased from 70 mg l 1to 280 mg l 1 besides this as it has been observed in table 2 interesting to compare cod removal obtained at different initial cod concentrations while all other variables are common and observed that the percentage removal is dependent on the initial cod concentration for instance runs 5 and 34 6 and 37 7 and 29 10 and 35 and 13 and 15 the higher the initial cod the higher the fraction of its removal in the cod and color removal models table 6 it was observed that the three term interaction i e initial cod h2o2 and ph and the two term interaction i e initial cod and h2o2 are positive respectively i e an increase in their value increases the response therefore for better cod and color removal the initial cod concentration must be in line with the amount of h2o2 added this can be elucidated by the scavenging effect of the excess h2o2 the free o h radicals generated in the system have an equal probability to be scavenged by the excess h2o2 or to attack the pollutants when the excess h2o2 goes for reacting with the free radicals as described in eq 7 that generate less reactive radicals like perhydroxyl ho 2 consequently the removal efficiency at lower initial cod reduces this may not be the case while using the higher concentration range of initial cod for instance 1000 5000 mg l 1 as reported in the research work of asaithambi et al 2020 in summary with the stated experimental concentration range of initial cod the oxidizing efficiency was increased with the concentration of initial cod 7 h2o2 oh ho 2 h2o 3 2 2 effect of initial ph when it comes to electrocoagulation ph is a key parameter as it affects the conductivity of the solution electrode dissolution and zeta potential 39 this study was conducted using different ph values ranging from 3 to 9 the ph value for each experimental run was adjusted by using either sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid as required depending on the combination of operational parameters with varying quantities different removal efficiencies were obtained for given ph value for the partially reduced model of cod removal it was shown that ph and initial cod are the main effects that play a significant role in reducing cod table 3 the prediction profiler also shows that how the removal efficiency of cod and color affected as ph changes fig 3 illustrates that as ph increases from 3 to 9 the cod and color removal also increased the slope of the black line the vertical red lines correspond to the current value of the factors the current value of each factor is also shown in red below the horizontal axis the red value on the vertical axis is the predicted response based on the current values of the factors these results are supported by the findings of lakshmanan and clifford 2009 this study conducted an experimental analysis of iron electrocoagulation at different ph ranges the generated fe2 during iron electrolysis undergoes oxidation in the presence of dissolved oxygen and a suitable ph around 8 5 to form fe3 that is finally hydrolyzed to form insoluble fe oh 3 s feooh s other studies also indicated that ferrous ions are only oxidized to ferric ions if the ph is above 5 41 42 it is therefore moving the ph value from low to high fig 3 shows better removal of cod and color from the treated healthcare wastewater as of better sweep flocculation 3 2 3 effect of h2o2 concentration the effect of h2o2 concentration is a critical issue in peroxi photoelectrocoagulation the addition of h2o2 further enhances the generation of hydroxyl radicals through the reaction with ferrous ions eq 8 the ferrous ions are regenerated by their reduction at the cathode surface eq 9 18 besides the presence of uv light in the system leads to the photolytic cleavage of h2o2 into two o h as described in eq 10 8 h2o2 fe2 fe3 oh oh 9 fe3 e fe2 10 h2o2 hv 2 oh for the present study h2o2 with three concentration levels of 150 225 and 300 mg l 1 was used at different experimental runs as can be seen in partially reduced models of cod and color removal tables 3 and 4 h2o2 played a significant role when interacting with other input variables i e initial cod ph rt current density than as a single effect this might be due to the characteristics of h2o2 it is a weak acid with relatively high oxidation potential e 1 77 v which alone does not lead to the generation of o h 43 the slow reaction rates make the process ineffective eqs 11 13 43 fig 4 displays the first order interaction of h2o2 with ph for cod and color removal respectively the two dimension contour plots of fig 4 illustrate the higher percentage of the cod and color were removed while lower level h2o2 interact with higher level ph this observation shows that the higher removal of cod and color is due to sweep flocculation than the fenton reaction in this system furthermore h2o2 is only effective for the treatment of the wastewater when combined with other input variables in the process like ph rt and current density 11 h2o2 ho2 h 12 h2o2 h2o ½ o2 13 h2o2 ho2 h2o o2 oh 3 2 4 effect of reaction time the reaction time has an important influence on the treatment efficiency and for economic applicability of the electrochemical process 44 in the present study the highest reaction time used was 60 min while the lowest was 30 min it was observed that rt as a single effect has a significant influence on the reduction of color table 6 and as interaction effects with h2o2 and ph fig 5 for the removal of cod rt has a significant combined effect while interacting with h2o2 and initial cod fig 6 in fig 6b it is shown that the amount of cod reduced more in the initial stage of the treatment time nearly 77 within 40 min and at high initial cod this might be due to the presence of excess colloids for the removal in high cod concentrations at the beginning of the treatment process 3 2 5 effect of current density current density determines the number of metal ions released from the electrodes into the bulk solution the dissociation of metal ions is directly proportional to the applied current density 39 the selection of a suitable current density is important for removal efficiency a high current density may negatively affect the system efficiency as coagulant overdosage can reverse the charge of the colloids and redistribute them and also reducing electrode lifetime and higher operating costs due to the increase in energy consumption 45 in the present study the cod and color removal efficiency of the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process was determined by applying the current density within the range of 3 5 7 ma cm 2 in the galvanostatic mode for each experimental run in the suggested model table 6 it is observed that current density has not appeared as a single effect within this experimental range but rather as an interaction effect with other main effects in reducing cod and color i e h2o2 the two dimension contour plots of fig 7 illustrate the region where the higher of the cod and color were removed while current density interacts with h2o2 this interaction shows that one of them has a low value while the other has a high value or vice versa for slightly better removal of cod and color as can be seen in the percentage value of the contour line in fig 7 this relationship between current density and h2o2 might help to reduce the cost of treatment by reducing energy consumption which is linked to current density see section 3 2 as can be seen in fig 7 lowering the current density and increasing the dose of h2o2 may still be efficient for the removal of cod and color from the wastewater this might be due to the parasitic reaction which is triggered by a high current density that decreases the oxidizing power of the system when an excess of ferrous ion reacts with the generated free oh radicals eq 14 this wasting reaction is competing with the pollutants that to be removed the sources for the concentration of a ferrous ion in the system is not only governed by the anodic dissolution of the ion but also the cathodic regeneration as can be seen in eq 9 the soluble fe3 can be cathodically reduced to fe2 and also the action of photons makes its contribution for ferrous ion concentration eqs 15 and 16 18 40 thus maintaining a suitable current density in the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process enhance the fenton reaction eq 8 by controlling the amount of ferrous ion released and by avoiding parasitic reaction eq 14 which is due to excess ferrous ion and also as can be seen in fig 7 the high current density and the low dose of h2o2 still be efficient for the removal of cod and color but in this case the mechanism involved in removal is sweep flocculation than fenton reaction as discussed in section 3 1 2 14 fe2 oh fe3 oh 3 3 energy consumption profile and average current efficiency the energy consumed to remove pollutants from the wastewater is the prime concern to assess the feasibility of electrochemical processes the total energy consumption in peroxi photoelectrocoagulation was calculated according to the mathematical expression described in eqs 4 5 and 6 table 2 shows that energy consumption ranges from 6 478 to 386 1 kw h kgcod 1 in the present study the energy consumption was affected significantly by the variables based on table 5 as single and interaction effects it was observed that current density reaction time and initial cod concentration were the obvious single effect variables to affect energy consumption the two dimension contour plots present visual results of the interactive variables influence on energy consumption fig 8 fig 8a shows that energy consumption increased linearly with rising current density and reaction time the interaction of ph and h2o2 was also observed to have a significant effect on energy expenditure fig 8b furthermore fig 8c and d show that the interaction of initial cod with current density and reaction time influence energy consumption lower energy expenditure was obtained for a shorter reaction time a smaller current density and a higher initial cod this is due to the amount of kilowatt hour kwh consumed in the system per cod load eqs 4 and 5 which is directly proportional to the current supplied and the reaction time and inversely linked to the load of the cod removed from the system the average current efficiency ace is a parameter used to determine the effect of electric current and hydraulic retention time on the rate of cod removal concerning the theoretical mass removed according to faraday s law the correlations estimated by the row wise method show that the increase in the ace increases the removal of cod and color and conversely to the energy consumption fig 9 furthermore the results of this experiment show that ace is inversely correlated to the current density and reaction time and found to be proportional to initial cod concentration fig 10 this might be because at the higher initial cod concentrations the more organic matter could be available for removal proportion to the supplied current thus there may be an effective utilization of the supplied current without waste of it the ace value in this experiment is as high as 777 table 2 than the theoretical 100 according to faraday law in calculating ace eq 3 is directly proportional to the load of the cod removed and inversely linked to the current supplied and the reaction time in ace the cod removed in the system is only evaluated based on the amount current supplied to the process and the reaction time allotted even though several mechanisms in the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process enhance the removal of cod beyond the supplied current only such as photolytic cleavage of h2o2 eq 10 photodecarboxylation of fe3 carboxylate species eq 15 promoting fe2 regeneration 18 and reductive photolysis of fe oh 2 eq 16 that catalyzes the fenton s reaction and producing additional oh 18 46 thus this might be the possible reasons for the high efficiency value of ace similar observation on high ace value is reported in the literature 35 47 15 fe oocr 2 hv fe2 co2 r 16 fe oh 2 hv fe2 oh 4 conclusions in the present study the efficiency of the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process for the treatment of healthcare wastewater was studied using five input variables initial cod of the healthcare wastewater the amount of hydrogen peroxide added ph reaction time and current density a 2 level full factorial design with 5 center points was created to investigate the effect of these parameters and the models were suggested for response variables of cod removal color removal and energy consumption in the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process the initial cod and ph were found to be the most significant variables in the reduction of cod and color increasing the ph value i e from 3 to 9 shows better removal of cod and color from the treated healthcare wastewater with the stated experimental concentration range of initial cod the removal efficiency was increased with an increase in the concentration of initial cod and lower energy expenditure was observed at higher initial cod shorter reaction time and smaller current density the average current efficiency ace was found as high as 777 ace is inversely correlated to the current density and reaction time and was found to increase with the increase in initial cod concentration this experiment shows that hydrogen peroxide only has a significant effect on the treatment of the wastewater when combined with other input variables in the process like ph rt and current density furthermore in the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process the current density does not appear as a single effect but rather as an interaction effect with h2o2 in reducing cod and color from these observations it can be concluded that the peroxi photoelectrocoagulation process could be considered as an alternative healthcare wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of

13566,cytostatic drugs have been widely and increasingly used and are poorly biodegraded in wastewater treatment plants so they are commonly found in wastewater effluents this study applied a solar photo fenton process to remove cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil the complex fe iii ethylenediamine n n disuccinic edds degraded cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil more efficiently than three other fe iii ligand complexes under ultraviolet uv and solar light irradiation fe iii edds also showed higher photoreactivity under solar light than under uv light cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil showed increasing degradation with increasing fe iii edds concentration and h2o2 dosage the addition of edds can widen the operational ph range of the solar photo fenton process to ph 3 0 8 5 a suitable fe iii edds ratio and initial dissolved oxygen level were demonstrated to affect the degradation performance cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil were rapidly degraded within 1 5 min k 5 131 and 5 407 min 1 respectively in the solar photo fenton process with the concentration of 0 1 mm fe iii edds and 1 mm h2o2 and detoxification throughout the process was also ensured in addition this study is the first to combine the uv h2o2 process with the solar photo fenton process to achieve the goal of total mineralization for engineering purposes this solar photo fenton process with a relatively low fe iii concentration and h2o2 dosage provides a promising potential alternative method for wastewater treatment under natural ph conditions with solar light keywords cyclophosphamide 5 fluorouracil solar photo fenton process mineralization microtox 1 introduction the occurrence and fate of emerging contaminants especially pharmaceutical compounds have attracted significant attention from the general public and scientists in recent years this is mainly because certain pharmaceutical compounds cannot be completely removed by conventional wastewater treatment plants many of these pharmaceutical compounds are toxic and harmful not only to humans but also to ecosystems and the environment among pharmaceuticals cytostatic drugs have attracted increasing attention recently because they are reported to exert cytotoxic genotoxic mutagenic and carcinogenic effects on nontarget organisms can cause damage to the structure and function of dna and have steadily increased in abundance because of the number of patients receiving anticancer chemotherapy treatments because of their carcinogenic effects cytostatic drugs are regulated in the united states and many european countries 1 cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil are the two most frequently used cytostatic drugs and represent distinct chemotherapeutic treatment groups the international agency for research on cancer iarc reported that the toxicity thresholds of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil are 94 and 230 carcinogenicity ng l 1 respectively cyclophosphamide is classified as group 1 carcinogenic compounds cyclophosphamide is also regulated in the contaminant candidate list 3 ccl3 because of its toxicity many studies have shown that cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil are poorly biodegraded in wastewater treatment plants 2 6 both cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil have been found in different water bodies with concentrations ranging from ng l 1 to μg l 1 4 7 9 advanced oxidation processes aops are processes that generate reactive oxygen species ros mainly hydroxyl radicals oh to oxidize persistent contaminants present in effluent water typical aops including ultraviolet uv o3 uv tio2 uv h2o2 and uv fenton and electro fenton processes 10 13 have been investigated for the degradation of various chemical compounds including organic dyes 14 antibiotics 15 pesticides 16 landfill leachates 17 and several cytostatic drugs 18 19 among aops fenton type reactions i e reactions between iron salts and h2o2 have been identified as an effective method for producing oh radicals the advantages of these processes are the safe and environmentally benign nature of the reagents and the short reaction time although the removal of organic contaminants is very efficient the fenton reaction obviously slows after the initial conversion of fe ii to fe iii potentially leading to large amounts of fe ii being needed to degrade contaminants the photo fenton process is similar to the fenton process but offers much higher removal efficiency by employing irradiation to accelerate oh radicals production although the conventional photo fenton reaction provides higher removal efficiency it requires a narrow ph range 2 8 3 5 and uv irradiation to operate therefore there is a growing interest in performing these processes under neutral ph conditions to widen the operational ph conditions of the photo fenton process ligands such as polycarboxylates and aminopolycarboxylic acids apcas are used to form iron complexes thereby preventing iron precipitation under neutral ph conditions the presence of such iron complexes can produce oh radicals with h2o2 under irradiation by the following reactions 1 and 2 20 21 1 fe iii ligand hv fe iii ligand fe ii ligand 2 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh oh polycarboxylates such as oxalate and citrate are commonly found in fog precipitation surface water and even soil solutions 22 23 they have the ability to form strong complexes with fe iii which improves the dissolution of iron in neutral ph water and can be used as ligands in the photo fenton process to degrade propranolol and alkylphenol ethoxylates 24 25 in addition apcas such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and nitrilotriacetic acid nta are organic acids that contain multiple carboxyl groups and are connected by nitrogen atoms fe iii edta and fe iii nta have good photochemical activity and have been used as ligands in the photo fenton process for the degradation of malathion 26 perchloroethylene 27 and 4 chlorophenol 28 under neutral ph conditions moreover fe iii complexes demonstrated not only higher degradation rates in the photo fenton process under near neutral ph conditions but also better operation feasibility under visible light ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds is a structural isomer and an environmentally friendly alternative for edta 29 30 fe iii edds can be photolyzed easily under irradiation and the quantum yield of oh radicals formation is higher in a wide ph range from 3 0 to 9 0 which shows that fe iii edds is stable in neutral and weakly basic aqueous solutions and is photochemically efficient 31 currently most studies on fe iii edds in photo fenton processes have been conducted under uv light irradiation bisphenol a bpa 32 4 tert butylphenyl 4 t bp 33 and 17 estradiol 34 were efficiently degraded in the photo fenton process under uv light irradiation in the presence of fe iii edds limited research is available on photo fenton processes using fe iii edds under solar light irradiation the photo fenton process initiated under solar light irradiation with the addition of fe iii edds was recently studied and found to be an efficient way to remove pharmaceuticals 35 36 despite the rapid contaminant removal in the photo fenton process in the presence of fe iii edds the initial total organic carbon toc in the solution increases after edds an additional toc source was added to form an fe iii edds complex which makes toc more difficult to remove completely after operation 37 and might pose a potential threat to water quality at present there is no study on the removal of residual toc in the solution after treatment with the photo fenton process furthermore there is no information about the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil by photo fenton processes using fe iii edds under solar irradiation therefore the purposes of this study were 1 to investigate the removal performance of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil by the photo fenton process with fe iii edds under solar light in comparison with uv light 2 to investigate the effects of different operational parameters including different ligands fe iii edds concentration h2o2 dosage initial ph fe iii edds ratio and initial dissolved oxygen concentration on the solar photo fenton process 3 to evaluate toc removal and the change in toxicity by microtox and 4 to combine the fe iii edds based photo fenton process with uv photolysis and uv h2o2 processes to further evaluate mineralization efficiency the results presented here demonstrate not only the effective removal of two antineoplastic drugs through a solar photo fenton process with fe iii edds but also the potential of this technology for further applications in wastewater treatment at neutral ph and under solar irradiation which overcome the operational limitations of conventional fenton and photo fenton processes in addition this study is the first to take toc removal into account after treatment with the solar photo fenton process to reach the goal of total mineralization and to avoid other water safety issues 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals oxalic acid dihydrate 99 5 citric acid monohydrate 98 ethylenediaminetetraacetic

liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms instrument applied biosystems foster city ca usa equipped with an electrospray ionization esi interface two mobile phases were used in the analytical method mobile phase a 0 1 formic acid in di water mobile phase b 0 1 formic acid in 100 methanol the flow rates of the two mobile phases and the injected volume of each sample were 1000 ml min 1 and 20 μg l 1 respectively table s1 the total dissolved ferrous ion concentration was determined through direct reaction with 110 phenanthroline and measurement of the absorbance at λ 510 nm 38 the hydrogen peroxide consumption was determined through reaction with potassium titanium iv oxalate and measurement of the absorbance at λ 400 nm 39 the absorbances of cyclophosphamide 5 fluorouracil different chelating agents and fe iii ligand complexes and changes in absorbance during operation were also investigated by screening at λ 290 800 nm via a uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr 6000 figs

microtox bioassay in a microtox model 500 analyzer azur environmental the sample toxicity was measured based on the reduction in light emitted by the lyophilized marine microorganism vibrio fischeri this method is also used by the u s epa for determining the aquatic acute toxicity of compounds 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary ligand screening experiments some ligands have been shown to have photochemical reactivity under uv and solar light and the potential to remove contaminants under near neutral ph conditions however the degradation performance might be affected by the iron complexation ability of ligands and the operating conditions 40 to investigate which ligand has the best performance in removing cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil oxalate citrate edta and edds were tested under uv and solar light irradiation in this study the concentrations of both target compounds the fe iii complex and h2o2 were fixed at 100 μg l 1 0 1 mm fe iii ligands 1 1 and 5 mm and all the experiments were controlled at ph 7 0 fig 1 a b c and d show the effects of different fe iii complexes on cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil removal under uv and solar light irradiation cyclophosphamide did not undergo direct uv or solar light photolysis or degradation under h2o2 addition alone 5 fluorouracil was not degraded by direct solar photolysis or h2o2 addition alone but was slightly degraded by direct uv photolysis the degradation trends of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil under uv and solar light irradiation are similar fe iii edds fe iii edta fe iii citrate fe iii oxalate the differences in the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil by using different fe iii complexes could be explained by the cyclic voltammogram data with different fe iii fe ii complexes compared with the redox potentials e for the free iron fe iii fe ii 0 700 v nhe fe iii fe ii edds is 0 069 v nhe at neutral ph 32 the e of fe iii fe ii edds is much lower than that of fe iii fe ii which could explain why in the presence of edds the fenton and photo fenton reactions are more thermodynamically favorable in addition the e value of fe iii fe ii edta is 0 096 v nhe 41 which is slightly higher than that of fe iii fe ii edds moreover the redox potentials of fe iii fe ii citrate and fe iii fe ii oxalate are much higher than that of fe iii fe ii edta under neutral ph conditions 42 43 therefore when the redox potential of the fe iii complex is lower the degradation performance of the system is higher these results suggest that the best degradation performance is obtained using a lower redox potential iron complex fe iii edds under both uv and solar light irradiation however the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil by using fe iii citrate and fe iii oxalate was significantly inhibited in comparison with fe iii edds and fe iii edta cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil could be completely removed in 10 min by using fe iii edds and fe iii edta under either uv or solar light irradiation although fe iii edds and fe iii edta both show rapid degradation of the target compounds edds is reported to be an easily biodegradable ligand that can serve as a replacement for edta in environmental applications 40 44 46 therefore fe iii edds is more environmental friendly and was chosen for the following further investigations in the solar photo fenton process the result also indicated the solar photo fenton by using fe iii edds could overcome the limitations of conventional fenton photo fenton processes and operate at neutral ph under solar light 3 2 photodegradation comparison in different systems after determining that fe iii edds is the best and most suitable complex for cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation a photodegradation comparison of the different systems was performed first under solar light before investigating the operational parameters the results of the degradation of both target compounds by using h2o2 fe iii fe iii h2o2 fe iii edds and fe iii edds h2o2 at ph 7 0 under irradiation are shown in fig 2 a and b these two figures show that in the presence of h2o2 fe iii alone and fe iii h2o2 the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil was less than 5 2 after 20 min of irradiation when only fe iii edds was present in the solution 11 7 and 37 8 of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil could be removed in 20 min however by adding h2o2 in the presence of fe iii edds the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil could be dramatically enhanced which was due to the high photoreactivity of fe iii edds accelerating oh radicals generation by the reaction between fe ii and h2o2 in the system the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil could reach 80 3 and 100 after 20 min the positive effect of edds addition can be attributed to two reasons 1 the fe iii edds complex improves the dissolution of the iron in the solution at neutral ph 2 the fe iii edds complex is photochemically efficient which leads to a higher quantum yield of oh radicals formation at a neutral ph ф oh 2 5 10 2 at ph 6 0 31 3 3 effect of h2o2 dosage the highly effective removal of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil by the solar photo fenton process in the presence of fe iii edds under solar light has been demonstrated to investigate the effect of h2o2 dosage on the solar photo fenton process a series of experiments were conducted using different h2o2 dosages from 0 1 mm to 1 5 mm the concentrations of the target compounds and fe iii edds were fixed at 100 μg l 1 and 0 02 mm and all the experiments were controlled at ph 7 0 since very rapid degradation of both target compounds occurs in the first 2 min of operation the degradation associated with the solar photo fenton process was well described by pseudo first order kinetics within the first 2 min r2 0 95 therefore the reaction rate constant k was also calculated for this time period for consistency fig 3 a and b show the effects of different h2o2 dosages on cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation the results show that in the presence of h2o2 at concentrations from 0 1 to 1 5 mm the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil was enhanced significantly the degradation of cyclophosphamide increased from 49 7 100 when the h2o2 was increased from 0 1 to 1 5 mm the degradation of 5 fluorouracil increased from 61 7 100 when the h2o2 was increased from 0 1 to 1 5 mm in the presence of 1 5 mm h2o2 both cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil could be almost completely removed in 5 min k 1 830 and 2 588 min 1 respectively in addition to the reaction between fe ii and h2o2 the irradiation of h2o2 might also produce oh radicals however the target compounds were not degraded under solar light irradiation in the presence of 1 mm h2o2 fig 2 therefore oh radicals were not directly produced from h2o2 photolysis under solar light wavelength 290 nm which is consistent with the results of other studies 47 in fact h2o2 can increase the formation of oh radicals to further decompose the target compounds however some studies demonstrated that excess h2o2 might also scavenge oh radicals slowing the degradation in our case no negative effects on the degradation of either target compound were observed when the dosage of h2o2 was increased from 0 1 to 1 5 mm 3 4 effect of fe iii edds concentrations to investigate the effect of the fe iii edds concentrations in the solar photo fenton process a series of experiments were conducted using different fe iii edds concentrations from 0 01 to 0 07 mm the cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil concentrations and h2o2 dosage were fixed at 100 μg l 1 and 1 mm and all the experiments were conducted at ph 7 0 the results in fig 4 a and b show that the presence of fe iii edds at concentrations from 0 01 to 0 07 mm significantly enhanced the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil the degradation of cyclophosphamide increased from 49 9 100 when the content of fe iii edds was increased from 0 01 to 0 07 mm the degradation of 5 fluorouracil increased from 67 6 100 when fe iii edds was increased from 0 01 to 0 07 mm in the presence of 0 07 mm fe iii edds both cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil could be almost completely removed in 3 min k 3 058 and 4 464 min 1 respectively in fact some studies showed negative impacts on performance with increased fe iii edds concentrations fe iii edds acts as a competitor for oh radicals and consequently inhibits target compound degradation when the fe iii edds concentration is too high for engineering practicality although more fe iii edds could be added to the system to remove more contaminants when h2o2 is present the concentration of dissolved iron is an important issue and must be controlled to meet the regulatory standards set for effluents when used in wastewater treatment in taiwan the effluent standard of dissolved iron is 10 mg l 1 which is much higher than that used in this study the highest concentration of total iron 3 92 mg l 1 3 5 effect of initial ph even though the photo fenton process with fe iii complexes has been demonstrated to be effective at contaminant removal at neutral ph 24 31 33 the ph is still an important operational parameter that affects compound degradation to investigate suitable ph values for degradation with fe iii edds experiments at ph 3 0 5 0 7 0 8 5 and 10 0 were carried out in the presence of 1 mm h2o2 and 0 02 mm fe iii edds the variation in different initial ph throughout the operation was less than 0 2 fig 5 a and b show the effects of different initial ph values on cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation the target compound concentrations were fixed at 100 μg l 1 from the results of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil the degradation was very efficient at ph 3 0 5 0 and 7 0 the trends in the degradation of both target compounds were similar the rate constants of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil at ph 3 0 were the highest with k 0 866 and 1 740 min 1 respectively however the degradation efficiencies of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil decreased obviously from ph 8 5 10 0 specifically 22 8 and 44 5 cyclophosphamide remained after 20 min at ph 8 5 and 10 0 and 6 4 and 25 3 5 fluorouracil remained after 20 min at ph 8 5 and 10 0 on the other hand the trends of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation were similar in the presence of 1 mm h2o2 and 0 05 mm fe iii edds fig s5 the degradation phenomena of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil could be explained by the precipitation of iron with increasing ph further impacting the degradation performance as expected a lower ph value ensured that as fe iii edds was destroyed under irradiation reaction 1 a large amount of iron ions remained dissolved rather than precipitating and promoted greater oh radicals production as the initial ph increases a second form of the complex fe oh l2 where l represents edds appears at ph 7 0 as demonstrated by theoretical fe iii complex calculations when ph 8 5 the second form fe oh l2 accounts for 50 of the iron and 50 is in the starting form fel which is present in acidic solutions the form fe oh l2 was demonstrated to be less photochemically active than fel which contributes to lower degradation performance at ph 7 48 the results also confirm the potential for removing contaminants by the solar photo fenton process via fe iii edds at neutral ph 3 6 effect of the fe iii edds ratio the fe iii ligand molar ratio should be optimized to improve the operating conditions for the solar photo fenton process however there is limited information about the effect of fe iii edds ratios on the process the molar ratio of fe iii ligand has to be at least stoichiometric i e 1 1 or higher even though the molar ratio can be theoretically identified a higher molar ratio is needed to provide sufficient chelation 49 to investigate the appropriate experimental ratio of fe iii edds four fe iii edds ratios were tested ratios 1 0 5 1 1 1 1 5 and 1 2 in the presence of 1 mm h2o2 and 0 02 mm fe iii edds at ph 7 0 fig 6 a and b show the effects of the fe iii edds ratios on cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation the degradation of both target compounds increased as the ratio changed from 1 0 5 to 1 1 5 and decreased when the ratio became 1 2 the most efficient conditions were achieved with a ratio of 1 1 5 and the degradations of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil reached 93 8 and 100 after 20 min k 1 103 and 1 964 min 1 respectively on the other hand the trends of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation were similar in the presence 0 5 mm h2o2 and 0 02 mm fe iii edds fig s6 the results could be explained by the higher fe iii edds ratio with less edds available for chelation decreasing the total amount of fe iii edds available for further target compound degradation in our case an fe iii edds ratio of 1 1 5 afforded the best removal efficiency for both target compounds which may be due to the small amount of free edds in the solution being used for further complexation after the initial reaction and generating more oh radicals to degrade the target compounds however a much lower fe iii edds ratio in the solution might lead to a higher concentration of free edds being present in the solution and the free ligand could compete with the target compounds further inhibiting degradation 3 7 effect of the initial dissolved oxygen oxygen is another important factor in photochemical reactions to investigate the effect of the initial dissolved oxygen on the solar photo fenton process reaction mixtures were purged with n2 and o2 for 1 h before the reaction and the results were compared with those of the control case without purging the initial dissolved oxygen in each case was measured before the reaction n2 purging 3 3 0 3 mg l 1 o2 purging 18 4 0 5 mg l 1 control case 8 4 0 1 mg l 1 the concentration of dissolved oxygen was also measured and did not change during 20 min of operation fig s7 the concentrations of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil the h2o2 dosage and the fe iii edds concentration were fixed at 100 μg l 1 1 mm and 0 02 mm respectively all experiments were conducted at ph 7 0 fig 7 a and b show the effects of the initial dissolved oxygen concentration on cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation o2 purging improved the degradation efficiency relative to that achieved with n2 purging and the control compared with the control case the degradations of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil increased with oxygen purging k 0 870 and 1 683 min 1 respectively however the degradations of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil decreased by 14 9 and 8 1 respectively after 20 min of operation with n2 purging in addition the trend of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation was similar in the presence 0 5 mm h2o2 and 0 02 mm fe iii edds fig s8 the results indicate that o2 can enhance the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil in fact dissolved oxygen reacts with edds while fe iii edds is initiated under solar light irradiation reaction 4 and produces superoxide radicals o2 reaction 5 along with its conjugated acid ho2 reaction 6 the o2 ho2 radicals can participate in further reactions producing h2o2 reaction 7 and promoting oh radicals formation by the fenton reaction 48 50 4 fe iii edds hv fe ii edds 5 edds o2 product o2 6 ho2 o2 h 7 o2 ho2 h2o h2o2 o2 oh at ph 7 o2 radicals is the predominant form according to the pka value to verify the impact of o2 radicals in the system chloroform chcl3 was used as scavenger of o2 radicals 51 fig s9 shows the additions of chloroform both 1 and 2 mm slightly inhibited and retarded cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation by 6 0 9 6 after 20 min of operation this result not only suggests the participation of o2 radicals in improving the performance in the system but also indicates that the presence of o2 radicals accounts for approximately 6 0 9 6 of the degradation of both target compounds in the system these finding and results are in good agreement with those of other studies 52 furthermore although oh radicals are considered to mainly decompose organic compounds in the system o2 and ho2 are further produced through reactions 5 and 6 and might react directly with compounds to enhance the degradation performance to verify the degradation mechanism of both target compounds 2 propanol a commonly used oh radicals scavenger was used in the study the results show that the presence of 2 propanol both 1 and 5 mm completely inhibited the photoreaction indicating that oh radicals are the major oxidant degrading cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil fig s10 which is also in good agreement in a previous study 53 3 8 mineralization and the change in toxicity although the main goal of this study was to investigate the degradation effectiveness of target compounds by the solar photo fenton process via fe iii edds at a neutral ph under solar light irradiation its mineralization and detoxification abilities were also evaluated the results showed rapid removal performance of the target compounds by the solar photo fenton process with edds addition however the initial toc increases when edds is added toc is another issue to be solved when total mineralization is considered fig 8 a shows that even though 5 fluorouracil was completely decomposed within 1 5 min by 0 07 and 0 1 mm fe iii edds k 4 464 and 5 407 min 1 68 9 and 70 8 of the toc still remained in the solutions with concentrations of 0 07 and 0 1 mm fe iii edds respectively after 180 min of reaction since 5 fluorouracil was in μg l 1 level more than 99 6 and 99 7 of the toc 8 46 and 12 08 mg l 1 were contributed by the 0 07 and 0 1 mm fe iii edds fig 8 b also shows that when higher concentrations of fe iii edds were added more h2o2 was consumed however slightly more toc remained in the solution when higher concentrations of fe iii edds were added this phenomenon suggests that an appropriate concentration of fe iii edds should be based not only on target compound degradation but also on other water quality concerns despite the partial toc removal the solar photo fenton process has the ability to reduce overall toxicity after 180 min of operation fig 8 c shows the change in toxicity in toxicity units tu during the treatment of 100 μg l 1 5 fluorouracil in the presence of 0 1 mm fe iii edds 1 1 and 1 mm h2o2 the toxicity first increased during the first 1 min and decreased from 1 5 min however the toxicity increased again from 5 10 min and then gradually decreased to the end of the operation these results are in good agreement with those of another study 37 the results also indicate that the change in the toxicity might be caused by different toxic byproducts formed in different time periods during the operation according to the toxicity classification via microtox bioassay the changes in toxicity of both target compounds during the operation were all in the nontoxic category tu 1 54 the final toxicity tu 0 01 was much lower than that of raw urban wastewater tu 0 80 0 90 37 thus the reduction in toxicity during the operation was demonstrated on the other hand the trend of toc removal and the change in toxicity during the treatment of 100 μg l 1 cyclophosphamide were very similar in the presence of 0 1 mm fe iii edds and 1 mm h2o2 fig s11 despite the reduction in toxicity during the operation toc remained in the solution and stayed constant after 10 min of operation which might be explained by the total consumption of h2o2 and fe iii edds and the cessation of the solar photo fenton reactions fig s12 although the solar photo fenton process can effectively remove cytostatic drugs rapidly and reduce toxicity after 180 min of operation the toc remains an issue if total mineralization is a concern to achieve the goal of total mineralization direct uv photolysis and uv h2o2 were chosen to evaluate the effectiveness of mineralization in combination with the solar photo fenton process fig 9 shows the comparisons of toc removal by the solar photo fenton process direct uv photolysis and uv h2o2 process after 10 min of operation with respect to the original solar photo fenton process the toc removal was slightly enhanced from 29 2 41 3 and 49 8 through the use of 16 w and 32 w uv light irradiation after 180 min of operation when h2o2 was added to the solution under 32 w uv light irradiation toc removal was greatly enhanced from 29 2 59 6 and 100 with additions of 1 and 5 mm h2o2 after 180 min of operation this result implies uv h2o2 is an appropriate method for combination with the solar photo fenton process to achieve total mineralization if advanced water quality is required 4 conclusion in this study the solar photo fenton process was shown to be effective in decomposing cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil using fe iii edds at neutral ph under solar irradiation edds was the best ligand for fe iii complexation for cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation in both the uv and solar photo fenton processes increasing the fe iii edds and h2o2 dosage had positive effects on target compound degradation however the addition of excess fe iii edds and h2o2 may negatively affect the degradation of both target compounds the appropriate initial concentrations depend on the properties and the concentrations of compounds used in the system the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil was effective under acidic and neutral conditions ph 3 0 7 0 and even weak alkaline conditions ph 8 5 which indicates that the operational ph range of the solar photo fenton process can be widened in the presence of edds when fe iii edds was used the ratio of fe iii and edds must be controlled at 1 1 5 to achieve the best degradation performance for both target compounds moreover the initial dissolved oxygen is also an important parameter in the solar photo fenton process although cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil were completely decomposed within 1 5 min by 0 07 and 0 1 mm fe iii edds only 29 7 29 2 of toc was removed with concentrations of 0 1 mm fe iii edds after 180 min of reaction however microtox results show that the detoxification of the solar photo fenton process was ensured after operation this technology has the potential to be widely applied in either domestic or hospital wastewater treatment plants to remove recalcitrant compounds that are known to be difficult to eliminate by conventional wastewater treatment processes in addition for the first time the combination of the solar photo fenton process and the uv h2o2 process was demonstrated to reach 100 toc removal within 180 min of operation providing a preliminary insight into further applications if total mineralization is required declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

13566,cytostatic drugs have been widely and increasingly used and are poorly biodegraded in wastewater treatment plants so they are commonly found in wastewater effluents this study applied a solar photo fenton process to remove cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil the complex fe iii ethylenediamine n n disuccinic edds degraded cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil more efficiently than three other fe iii ligand complexes under ultraviolet uv and solar light irradiation fe iii edds also showed higher photoreactivity under solar light than under uv light cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil showed increasing degradation with increasing fe iii edds concentration and h2o2 dosage the addition of edds can widen the operational ph range of the solar photo fenton process to ph 3 0 8 5 a suitable fe iii edds ratio and initial dissolved oxygen level were demonstrated to affect the degradation performance cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil were rapidly degraded within 1 5 min k 5 131 and 5 407 min 1 respectively in the solar photo fenton process with the concentration of 0 1 mm fe iii edds and 1 mm h2o2 and detoxification throughout the process was also ensured in addition this study is the first to combine the uv h2o2 process with the solar photo fenton process to achieve the goal of total mineralization for engineering purposes this solar photo fenton process with a relatively low fe iii concentration and h2o2 dosage provides a promising potential alternative method for wastewater treatment under natural ph conditions with solar light keywords cyclophosphamide 5 fluorouracil solar photo fenton process mineralization microtox 1 introduction the occurrence and fate of emerging contaminants especially pharmaceutical compounds have attracted significant attention from the general public and scientists in recent years this is mainly because certain pharmaceutical compounds cannot be completely removed by conventional wastewater treatment plants many of these pharmaceutical compounds are toxic and harmful not only to humans but also to ecosystems and the environment among pharmaceuticals cytostatic drugs have attracted increasing attention recently because they are reported to exert cytotoxic genotoxic mutagenic and carcinogenic effects on nontarget organisms can cause damage to the structure and function of dna and have steadily increased in abundance because of the number of patients receiving anticancer chemotherapy treatments because of their carcinogenic effects cytostatic drugs are regulated in the united states and many european countries 1 cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil are the two most frequently used cytostatic drugs and represent distinct chemotherapeutic treatment groups the international agency for research on cancer iarc reported that the toxicity thresholds of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil are 94 and 230 carcinogenicity ng l 1 respectively cyclophosphamide is classified as group 1 carcinogenic compounds cyclophosphamide is also regulated in the contaminant candidate list 3 ccl3 because of its toxicity many studies have shown that cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil are poorly biodegraded in wastewater treatment plants 2 6 both cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil have been found in different water bodies with concentrations ranging from ng l 1 to μg l 1 4 7 9 advanced oxidation processes aops are processes that generate reactive oxygen species ros mainly hydroxyl radicals oh to oxidize persistent contaminants present in effluent water typical aops including ultraviolet uv o3 uv tio2 uv h2o2 and uv fenton and electro fenton processes 10 13 have been investigated for the degradation of various chemical compounds including organic dyes 14 antibiotics 15 pesticides 16 landfill leachates 17 and several cytostatic drugs 18 19 among aops fenton type reactions i e reactions between iron salts and h2o2 have been identified as an effective method for producing oh radicals the advantages of these processes are the safe and environmentally benign nature of the reagents and the short reaction time although the removal of organic contaminants is very efficient the fenton reaction obviously slows after the initial conversion of fe ii to fe iii potentially leading to large amounts of fe ii being needed to degrade contaminants the photo fenton process is similar to the fenton process but offers much higher removal efficiency by employing irradiation to accelerate oh radicals production although the conventional photo fenton reaction provides higher removal efficiency it requires a narrow ph range 2 8 3 5 and uv irradiation to operate therefore there is a growing interest in performing these processes under neutral ph conditions to widen the operational ph conditions of the photo fenton process ligands such as polycarboxylates and aminopolycarboxylic acids apcas are used to form iron complexes thereby preventing iron precipitation under neutral ph conditions the presence of such iron complexes can produce oh radicals with h2o2 under irradiation by the following reactions 1 and 2 20 21 1 fe iii ligand hv fe iii ligand fe ii ligand 2 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh oh polycarboxylates such as oxalate and citrate are commonly found in fog precipitation surface water and even soil solutions 22 23 they have the ability to form strong complexes with fe iii which improves the dissolution of iron in neutral ph water and can be used as ligands in the photo fenton process to degrade propranolol and alkylphenol ethoxylates 24 25 in addition apcas such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and nitrilotriacetic acid nta are organic acids that contain multiple carboxyl groups and are connected by nitrogen atoms fe iii edta and fe iii nta have good photochemical activity and have been used as ligands in the photo fenton process for the degradation of malathion 26 perchloroethylene 27 and 4 chlorophenol 28 under neutral ph conditions moreover fe iii complexes demonstrated not only higher degradation rates in the photo fenton process under near neutral ph conditions but also better operation feasibility under visible light ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds is a structural isomer and an environmentally friendly alternative for edta 29 30 fe iii edds can be photolyzed easily under irradiation and the quantum yield of oh radicals formation is higher in a wide ph range from 3 0 to 9 0 which shows that fe iii edds is stable in neutral and weakly basic aqueous solutions and is photochemically efficient 31 currently most studies on fe iii edds in photo fenton processes have been conducted under uv light irradiation bisphenol a bpa 32 4 tert butylphenyl 4 t bp 33 and 17 estradiol 34 were efficiently degraded in the photo fenton process under uv light irradiation in the presence of fe iii edds limited research is available on photo fenton processes using fe iii edds under solar light irradiation the photo fenton process initiated under solar light irradiation with the addition of fe iii edds was recently studied and found to be an efficient way to remove pharmaceuticals 35 36 despite the rapid contaminant removal in the photo fenton process in the presence of fe iii edds the initial total organic carbon toc in the solution increases after edds an additional toc source was added to form an fe iii edds complex which makes toc more difficult to remove completely after operation 37 and might pose a potential threat to water quality at present there is no study on the removal of residual toc in the solution after treatment with the photo fenton process furthermore there is no information about the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil by photo fenton processes using fe iii edds under solar irradiation therefore the purposes of this study were 1 to investigate the removal performance of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil by the photo fenton process with fe iii edds under solar light in comparison with uv light 2 to investigate the effects of different operational parameters including different ligands fe iii edds concentration h2o2 dosage initial ph fe iii edds ratio and initial dissolved oxygen concentration on the solar photo fenton process 3 to evaluate toc removal and the change in toxicity by microtox and 4 to combine the fe iii edds based photo fenton process with uv photolysis and uv h2o2 processes to further evaluate mineralization efficiency the results presented here demonstrate not only the effective removal of two antineoplastic drugs through a solar photo fenton process with fe iii edds but also the potential of this technology for further applications in wastewater treatment at neutral ph and under solar irradiation which overcome the operational limitations of conventional fenton and photo fenton processes in addition this study is the first to take toc removal into account after treatment with the solar photo fenton process to reach the goal of total mineralization and to avoid other water safety issues 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals oxalic acid dihydrate 99 5 citric acid monohydrate 98 ethylenediaminetetraacetic

have photochemical reactivity under uv and solar light and the potential to remove contaminants under near neutral ph conditions however the degradation performance might be affected by the iron complexation ability of ligands and the operating conditions 40 to investigate which ligand has the best performance in removing cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil oxalate citrate edta and edds were tested under uv and solar light irradiation in this study the concentrations of both target compounds the fe iii complex and h2o2 were fixed at 100 μg l 1 0 1 mm fe iii ligands 1 1 and 5 mm and all the experiments were controlled at ph 7 0 fig 1 a b c and d show the effects of different fe iii complexes on cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil removal under uv and solar light irradiation cyclophosphamide did not undergo direct uv or solar light photolysis or degradation under h2o2 addition alone 5 fluorouracil was not degraded by direct solar photolysis or h2o2 addition alone but was slightly degraded by direct uv photolysis the degradation trends of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil under uv and solar light irradiation are similar fe iii edds fe iii edta fe iii citrate fe iii oxalate the differences in the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil by using different fe iii complexes could be explained by the cyclic voltammogram data with different fe iii fe ii complexes compared with the redox potentials e for the free iron fe iii fe ii 0 700 v nhe fe iii fe ii edds is 0 069 v nhe at neutral ph 32 the e of fe iii fe ii edds is much lower than that of fe iii fe ii which could explain why in the presence of edds the fenton and photo fenton reactions are more thermodynamically favorable in addition the e value of fe iii fe ii edta is 0 096 v nhe 41 which is slightly higher than that of fe iii fe ii edds moreover the redox potentials of fe iii fe ii citrate and fe iii fe ii oxalate are much higher than that of fe iii fe ii edta under neutral ph conditions 42 43 therefore when the redox potential of the fe iii complex is lower the degradation performance of the system is higher these results suggest that the best degradation performance is obtained using a lower redox potential iron complex fe iii edds under both uv and solar light irradiation however the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil by using fe iii citrate and fe iii oxalate was significantly inhibited in comparison with fe iii edds and fe iii edta cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil could be completely removed in 10 min by using fe iii edds and fe iii edta under either uv or solar light irradiation although fe iii edds and fe iii edta both show rapid degradation of the target compounds edds is reported to be an easily biodegradable ligand that can serve as a replacement for edta in environmental applications 40 44 46 therefore fe iii edds is more environmental friendly and was chosen for the following further investigations in the solar photo fenton process the result also indicated the solar photo fenton by using fe iii edds could overcome the limitations of conventional fenton photo fenton processes and operate at neutral ph under solar light 3 2 photodegradation comparison in different systems after determining that fe iii edds is the best and most suitable complex for cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation a photodegradation comparison of the different systems was performed first under solar light before investigating the operational parameters the results of the degradation of both target compounds by using h2o2 fe iii fe iii h2o2 fe iii edds and fe iii edds h2o2 at ph 7 0 under irradiation are shown in fig 2 a and b these two figures show that in the presence of h2o2 fe iii alone and fe iii h2o2 the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil was less than 5 2 after 20 min of irradiation when only fe iii edds was present in the solution 11 7 and 37 8 of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil could be removed in 20 min however by adding h2o2 in the presence of fe iii edds the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil could be dramatically enhanced which was due to the high photoreactivity of fe iii edds accelerating oh radicals generation by the reaction between fe ii and h2o2 in the system the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil could reach 80 3 and 100 after 20 min the positive effect of edds addition can be attributed to two reasons 1 the fe iii edds complex improves the dissolution of the iron in the solution at neutral ph 2 the fe iii edds complex is photochemically efficient which leads to a higher quantum yield of oh radicals formation at a neutral ph ф oh 2 5 10 2 at ph 6 0 31 3 3 effect of h2o2 dosage the highly effective removal of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil by the solar photo fenton process in the presence of fe iii edds under solar light has been demonstrated to investigate the effect of h2o2 dosage on the solar photo fenton process a series of experiments were conducted using different h2o2 dosages from 0 1 mm to 1 5 mm the concentrations of the target compounds and fe iii edds were fixed at 100 μg l 1 and 0 02 mm and all the experiments were controlled at ph 7 0 since very rapid degradation of both target compounds occurs in the first 2 min of operation the degradation associated with the solar photo fenton process was well described by pseudo first order kinetics within the first 2 min r2 0 95 therefore the reaction rate constant k was also calculated for this time period for consistency fig 3 a and b show the effects of different h2o2 dosages on cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation the results show that in the presence of h2o2 at concentrations from 0 1 to 1 5 mm the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil was enhanced significantly the degradation of cyclophosphamide increased from 49 7 100 when the h2o2 was increased from 0 1 to 1 5 mm the degradation of 5 fluorouracil increased from 61 7 100 when the h2o2 was increased from 0 1 to 1 5 mm in the presence of 1 5 mm h2o2 both cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil could be almost completely removed in 5 min k 1 830 and 2 588 min 1 respectively in addition to the reaction between fe ii and h2o2 the irradiation of h2o2 might also produce oh radicals however the target compounds were not degraded under solar light irradiation in the presence of 1 mm h2o2 fig 2 therefore oh radicals were not directly produced from h2o2 photolysis under solar light wavelength 290 nm which is consistent with the results of other studies 47 in fact h2o2 can increase the formation of oh radicals to further decompose the target compounds however some studies demonstrated that excess h2o2 might also scavenge oh radicals slowing the degradation in our case no negative effects on the degradation of either target compound were observed when the dosage of h2o2 was increased from 0 1 to 1 5 mm 3 4 effect of fe iii edds concentrations to investigate the effect of the fe iii edds concentrations in the solar photo fenton process a series of experiments were conducted using different fe iii edds concentrations from 0 01 to 0 07 mm the cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil concentrations and h2o2 dosage were fixed at 100 μg l 1 and 1 mm and all the experiments were conducted at ph 7 0 the results in fig 4 a and b show that the presence of fe iii edds at concentrations from 0 01 to 0 07 mm significantly enhanced the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil the degradation of cyclophosphamide increased from 49 9 100 when the content of fe iii edds was increased from 0 01 to 0 07 mm the degradation of 5 fluorouracil increased from 67 6 100 when fe iii edds was increased from 0 01 to 0 07 mm in the presence of 0 07 mm fe iii edds both cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil could be almost completely removed in 3 min k 3 058 and 4 464 min 1 respectively in fact some studies showed negative impacts on performance with increased fe iii edds concentrations fe iii edds acts as a competitor for oh radicals and consequently inhibits target compound degradation when the fe iii edds concentration is too high for engineering practicality although more fe iii edds could be added to the system to remove more contaminants when h2o2 is present the concentration of dissolved iron is an important issue and must be controlled to meet the regulatory standards set for effluents when used in wastewater treatment in taiwan the effluent standard of dissolved iron is 10 mg l 1 which is much higher than that used in this study the highest concentration of total iron 3 92 mg l 1 3 5 effect of initial ph even though the photo fenton process with fe iii complexes has been demonstrated to be effective at contaminant removal at neutral ph 24 31 33 the ph is still an important operational parameter that affects compound degradation to investigate suitable ph values for degradation with fe iii edds experiments at ph 3 0 5 0 7 0 8 5 and 10 0 were carried out in the presence of 1 mm h2o2 and 0 02 mm fe iii edds the variation in different initial ph throughout the operation was less than 0 2 fig 5 a and b show the effects of different initial ph values on cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation the target compound concentrations were fixed at 100 μg l 1 from the results of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil the degradation was very efficient at ph 3 0 5 0 and 7 0 the trends in the degradation of both target compounds were similar the rate constants of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil at ph 3 0 were the highest with k 0 866 and 1 740 min 1 respectively however the degradation efficiencies of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil decreased obviously from ph 8 5 10 0 specifically 22 8 and 44 5 cyclophosphamide remained after 20 min at ph 8 5 and 10 0 and 6 4 and 25 3 5 fluorouracil remained after 20 min at ph 8 5 and 10 0 on the other hand the trends of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation were similar in the presence of 1 mm h2o2 and 0 05 mm fe iii edds fig s5 the degradation phenomena of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil could be explained by the precipitation of iron with increasing ph further impacting the degradation performance as expected a lower ph value ensured that as fe iii edds was destroyed under irradiation reaction 1 a large amount of iron ions remained dissolved rather than precipitating and promoted greater oh radicals production as the initial ph increases a second form of the complex fe oh l2 where l represents edds appears at ph 7 0 as demonstrated by theoretical fe iii complex calculations when ph 8 5 the second form fe oh l2 accounts for 50 of the iron and 50 is in the starting form fel which is present in acidic solutions the form fe oh l2 was demonstrated to be less photochemically active than fel which contributes to lower degradation performance at ph 7 48 the results also confirm the potential for removing contaminants by the solar photo fenton process via fe iii edds at neutral ph 3 6 effect of the fe iii edds ratio the fe iii ligand molar ratio should be optimized to improve the operating conditions for the solar photo fenton process however there is limited information about the effect of fe iii edds ratios on the process the molar ratio of fe iii ligand has to be at least stoichiometric i e 1 1 or higher even though the molar ratio can be theoretically identified a higher molar ratio is needed to provide sufficient chelation 49 to investigate the appropriate experimental ratio of fe iii edds four fe iii edds ratios were tested ratios 1 0 5 1 1 1 1 5 and 1 2 in the presence of 1 mm h2o2 and 0 02 mm fe iii edds at ph 7 0 fig 6 a and b show the effects of the fe iii edds ratios on cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation the degradation of both target compounds increased as the ratio changed from 1 0 5 to 1 1 5 and decreased when the ratio became 1 2 the most efficient conditions were achieved with a ratio of 1 1 5 and the degradations of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil reached 93 8 and 100 after 20 min k 1 103 and 1 964 min 1 respectively on the other hand the trends of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation were similar in the presence 0 5 mm h2o2 and 0 02 mm fe iii edds fig s6 the results could be explained by the higher fe iii edds ratio with less edds available for chelation decreasing the total amount of fe iii edds available for further target compound degradation in our case an fe iii edds ratio of 1 1 5 afforded the best removal efficiency for both target compounds which may be due to the small amount of free edds in the solution being used for further complexation after the initial reaction and generating more oh radicals to degrade the target compounds however a much lower fe iii edds ratio in the solution might lead to a higher concentration of free edds being present in the solution and the free ligand could compete with the target compounds further inhibiting degradation 3 7 effect of the initial dissolved oxygen oxygen is another important factor in photochemical reactions to investigate the effect of the initial dissolved oxygen on the solar photo fenton process reaction mixtures were purged with n2 and o2 for 1 h before the reaction and the results were compared with those of the control case without purging the initial dissolved oxygen in each case was measured before the reaction n2 purging 3 3 0 3 mg l 1 o2 purging 18 4 0 5 mg l 1 control case 8 4 0 1 mg l 1 the concentration of dissolved oxygen was also measured and did not change during 20 min of operation fig s7 the concentrations of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil the h2o2 dosage and the fe iii edds concentration were fixed at 100 μg l 1 1 mm and 0 02 mm respectively all experiments were conducted at ph 7 0 fig 7 a and b show the effects of the initial dissolved oxygen concentration on cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation o2 purging improved the degradation efficiency relative to that achieved with n2 purging and the control compared with the control case the degradations of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil increased with oxygen purging k 0 870 and 1 683 min 1 respectively however the degradations of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil decreased by 14 9 and 8 1 respectively after 20 min of operation with n2 purging in addition the trend of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation was similar in the presence 0 5 mm h2o2 and 0 02 mm fe iii edds fig s8 the results indicate that o2 can enhance the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil in fact dissolved oxygen reacts with edds while fe iii edds is initiated under solar light irradiation reaction 4 and produces superoxide radicals o2 reaction 5 along with its conjugated acid ho2 reaction 6 the o2 ho2 radicals can participate in further reactions producing h2o2 reaction 7 and promoting oh radicals formation by the fenton reaction 48 50 4 fe iii edds hv fe ii edds 5 edds o2 product o2 6 ho2 o2 h 7 o2 ho2 h2o h2o2 o2 oh at ph 7 o2 radicals is the predominant form according to the pka value to verify the impact of o2 radicals in the system chloroform chcl3 was used as scavenger of o2 radicals 51 fig s9 shows the additions of chloroform both 1 and 2 mm slightly inhibited and retarded cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation by 6 0 9 6 after 20 min of operation this result not only suggests the participation of o2 radicals in improving the performance in the system but also indicates that the presence of o2 radicals accounts for approximately 6 0 9 6 of the degradation of both target compounds in the system these finding and results are in good agreement with those of other studies 52 furthermore although oh radicals are considered to mainly decompose organic compounds in the system o2 and ho2 are further produced through reactions 5 and 6 and might react directly with compounds to enhance the degradation performance to verify the degradation mechanism of both target compounds 2 propanol a commonly used oh radicals scavenger was used in the study the results show that the presence of 2 propanol both 1 and 5 mm completely inhibited the photoreaction indicating that oh radicals are the major oxidant degrading cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil fig s10 which is also in good agreement in a previous study 53 3 8 mineralization and the change in toxicity although the main goal of this study was to investigate the degradation effectiveness of target compounds by the solar photo fenton process via fe iii edds at a neutral ph under solar light irradiation its mineralization and detoxification abilities were also evaluated the results showed rapid removal performance of the target compounds by the solar photo fenton process with edds addition however the initial toc increases when edds is added toc is another issue to be solved when total mineralization is considered fig 8 a shows that even though 5 fluorouracil was completely decomposed within 1 5 min by 0 07 and 0 1 mm fe iii edds k 4 464 and 5 407 min 1 68 9 and 70 8 of the toc still remained in the solutions with concentrations of 0 07 and 0 1 mm fe iii edds respectively after 180 min of reaction since 5 fluorouracil was in μg l 1 level more than 99 6 and 99 7 of the toc 8 46 and 12 08 mg l 1 were contributed by the 0 07 and 0 1 mm fe iii edds fig 8 b also shows that when higher concentrations of fe iii edds were added more h2o2 was consumed however slightly more toc remained in the solution when higher concentrations of fe iii edds were added this phenomenon suggests that an appropriate concentration of fe iii edds should be based not only on target compound degradation but also on other water quality concerns despite the partial toc removal the solar photo fenton process has the ability to reduce overall toxicity after 180 min of operation fig 8 c shows the change in toxicity in toxicity units tu during the treatment of 100 μg l 1 5 fluorouracil in the presence of 0 1 mm fe iii edds 1 1 and 1 mm h2o2 the toxicity first increased during the first 1 min and decreased from 1 5 min however the toxicity increased again from 5 10 min and then gradually decreased to the end of the operation these results are in good agreement with those of another study 37 the results also indicate that the change in the toxicity might be caused by different toxic byproducts formed in different time periods during the operation according to the toxicity classification via microtox bioassay the changes in toxicity of both target compounds during the operation were all in the nontoxic category tu 1 54 the final toxicity tu 0 01 was much lower than that of raw urban wastewater tu 0 80 0 90 37 thus the reduction in toxicity during the operation was demonstrated on the other hand the trend of toc removal and the change in toxicity during the treatment of 100 μg l 1 cyclophosphamide were very similar in the presence of 0 1 mm fe iii edds and 1 mm h2o2 fig s11 despite the reduction in toxicity during the operation toc remained in the solution and stayed constant after 10 min of operation which might be explained by the total consumption of h2o2 and fe iii edds and the cessation of the solar photo fenton reactions fig s12 although the solar photo fenton process can effectively remove cytostatic drugs rapidly and reduce toxicity after 180 min of operation the toc remains an issue if total mineralization is a concern to achieve the goal of total mineralization direct uv photolysis and uv h2o2 were chosen to evaluate the effectiveness of mineralization in combination with the solar photo fenton process fig 9 shows the comparisons of toc removal by the solar photo fenton process direct uv photolysis and uv h2o2 process after 10 min of operation with respect to the original solar photo fenton process the toc removal was slightly enhanced from 29 2 41 3 and 49 8 through the use of 16 w and 32 w uv light irradiation after 180 min of operation when h2o2 was added to the solution under 32 w uv light irradiation toc removal was greatly enhanced from 29 2 59 6 and 100 with additions of 1 and 5 mm h2o2 after 180 min of operation this result implies uv h2o2 is an appropriate method for combination with the solar photo fenton process to achieve total mineralization if advanced water quality is required 4 conclusion in this study the solar photo fenton process was shown to be effective in decomposing cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil using fe iii edds at neutral ph under solar irradiation edds was the best ligand for fe iii complexation for cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil degradation in both the uv and solar photo fenton processes increasing the fe iii edds and h2o2 dosage had positive effects on target compound degradation however the addition of excess fe iii edds and h2o2 may negatively affect the degradation of both target compounds the appropriate initial concentrations depend on the properties and the concentrations of compounds used in the system the degradation of cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil was effective under acidic and neutral conditions ph 3 0 7 0 and even weak alkaline conditions ph 8 5 which indicates that the operational ph range of the solar photo fenton process can be widened in the presence of edds when fe iii edds was used the ratio of fe iii and edds must be controlled at 1 1 5 to achieve the best degradation performance for both target compounds moreover the initial dissolved oxygen is also an important parameter in the solar photo fenton process although cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil were completely decomposed within 1 5 min by 0 07 and 0 1 mm fe iii edds only 29 7 29 2 of toc was removed with concentrations of 0 1 mm fe iii edds after 180 min of reaction however microtox results show that the detoxification of the solar photo fenton process was ensured after operation this technology has the potential to be widely applied in either domestic or hospital wastewater treatment plants to remove recalcitrant compounds that are known to be difficult to eliminate by conventional wastewater treatment processes in addition for the first time the combination of the solar photo fenton process and the uv h2o2 process was demonstrated to reach 100 toc removal within 180 min of operation providing a preliminary insight into further applications if total mineralization is required declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

13567,accurate modelling of constructed wetlands is vital for furthering the use of these systems constructed wetlands can treat various types of wastewater including domestic wastewater agricultural wastewater industrial and mining wastewater and stormwater runoff physical chemical and biological processes all take place simultaneously to breakdown the contaminants in wastewater and while the combination of so many processes makes them an effective wastewater treatment system it can also make the modelling of these systems intricate the modelling technique used is dependent on the goal of the model whether it is for design or scientific research the extent to which contaminants are broken down by these processes is highly dependent on the time the water spends in the system and this time is dependent on and can be quantified by the understanding of the hydraulic behaviour of the constructed wetland tracer studies are the most common way to determine the hydraulic behaviour of the system and the data from these studies can be used in various ways to quantify time in the system there are three aims of this paper the first is to give wetland researchers an idea of what hydraulic modelling techniques are available the second is to indicate the connection between accurate hydraulic modelling and the modelling of kinetic processes and the third is to guide the researchers in determining which model is best suited for their needs based on research needs and characteristics of the wetland keywords constructed wetlands hydraulic behaviour hydraulic modelling tracer studies 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws are low cost and low maintenance systems which have the ability to treat various types of wastewater including domestic wastewater 1 3 agricultural wastewater 4 5 and stormwater run off 6 to name a few 7 there are three main types of cws free water surface fws horizontal sub surface flow hf and vertical flow sub surface vf physical chemical and biological processes all take place simultaneously within the cws and in doing so reduce the pollutant load of the wastewater to use these systems as an effective form of wastewater treatment accurate design and modelling are required there are various cw design methodologies which are primarily linked to flow type they can include characteristics such as surface or subsurface flow vertical or horizontal flow and saturated or unsaturated flow 8 for these systems to be effective accurate design and modelling are required many studies have been conducted in the last three decades to improve the models with varying levels of complexity the problem with cw modelling is that the inherent complexity of the cw itself means that the model may require more time or computational power than is available or necessary under the circumstances 8 for the design of cws the models developed tend to be simpler and require less computational power than those developed for scientific research but they may not be as accurate 8 1 1 history of wetland modelling the original cw models developed were considered black box models which relied on empirical correlations between inlet and outlet concentrations 9 and were often developed for and could only be used for a very specific system correlations based on the surface area regression and first order models were used and inherent in these models is an assumption about the flow typically that there is ideal plug flow in the cw given the complexity of these systems and based on research conducted in recent years it can be said that this assumption does not hold and that these empirical correlation based models are not adequate to model cws subsequently modelling has advanced to mechanistic and process based models these models can be divided into two categories 1 models which describe the hydraulic behaviour of the cw in detail but assume simple kinetics or focus on the reactive transport of a single contaminant 2 models which describe the detailed reactive transport of a single or multiple contaminant s but assumes simplified or ideal hydraulic behaviour in both cases some simplifying assumptions have been made either with regards to reaction kinetics or hydraulic behaviour in recent years models have been developed which combine detailed modelling of both hydraulic behaviour and reaction kinetics these models typically require extensive computational power a specific software and a detailed understanding of numerical modelling cws are in essence a reactor and the extent of reaction is dependent on the time the fluid spends in the cw an investigation into the hydraulic behaviour of a cw allows for the determination of this time and subsequently the effectiveness of the system in reducing contaminant load therefore for cw models to be accurate the characterisation of hydraulic behaviour must be accurate the flow behaviour of a cw influences its ability to breakdown inlet contaminants 10 there is a distribution of flow velocities within the system and the combination of these gives the overall hydraulic behaviour of the system many investigations have found that there are 3 different hydraulic zones in cws the main flow path a temporary storage zone where components and water are exchanged with the main flow path and a dead zone 11 12 by investigating the hydraulic behaviour of a cw it is possible to indicate whether there are hindrances to ideal flow such as bypassing which is when a section of the fluid moves through the system much more quickly than the bulk of the fluid resulting in reduced time spent in the cw dead zones which are sections of in the system through which fluid does not flow and solute transport is due only to dispersion and mixing all these factors contribute to the time that wastewater spends in the cw known as the residence time this in turn relates to how long the water is in the system to break down organics convert nitrogen species and degrade other contaminants if a cw has poor hydraulic behaviour then pollutant removal will be poor and conversion for which the system was designed will not be achieved it is tempting to model the flow of a cw as an ideal plug flow reactor pfr in which every fluid particle moves through the reactor with the same velocity and has the same residence time however it has been shown by multiple researchers that the hydraulic behaviour of cws is far from this ideal case 13 14 the flow characteristics of cws are elaborate and non ideal owing to the changing root structure and the complicated flow pathway of fluid through gravel or soil matrix bonner et al 2017 factors such as cw shape 15 16 inlet and outlet location 17 18 and vegetation distribution 17 19 21 can affect the hydraulic behaviour of cws vegetation distribution is a variable barrier to flow in terms of the plant size shape and position as a result there is bypass and short circuiting around plant mass forming dead zones which leads to a hold up of water results zones with no reaction in certain areas the formation of different velocity profiles can lead to a distribution of residence times the shortest time is experienced by the water moving at the maximum velocity in the profile which would normally be in the surface layer of the micro channels with the longest times experienced by water that moves near drag inducing surfaces such as the cw bottom 13 there are various techniques and models which exists for the characterisation of the hydraulic behaviour of cws and the solute transport in the systems these include the method of moments technique the tanks in series reactor model the advection dispersion transport equation etc a review of the experimental methods used to obtain hydraulic characteristics the methods used to analyse the data from these experiments and the use of this data in process based models is the focus of this paper this information is important since the hydraulic characteristics determine the length of time the wastewater spends in the cw and the time determines the extent of treatment a guide to conducting investigating and modelling the hydraulic characteristics is included to aid the design and effective use of cws as a form of wastewater treatment 2 experimental procedures for understanding flow behaviour the most common way to characterise the flow patterns and assess the hydraulic behaviour of a cw is by conducting residence time distribution rtd studies 22 the residence time distribution of a reactor gives the probability of a fluid element spending a specific amount of time in the reactor and is characteristic of the mixing that occurs within the system 23 the rtd is obtained by running a flow tracer study on the system a flow tracer study is a stimulus response experiment in which an inert flow tracer is injected either as an impulse or as a step change in concentration into the system inlet pipe and the tracer concentration is measured continuously at the effluent an effective tracer study requires the flow to be laminar 24 if the data is to be successfully extrapolated scaled to other operational flow rates as long as they are also laminar data from these experiments are then used in rtd modelling methodologies to analyse the flow characteristics of the reactor and can be used to quantify a set of characteristics that describe the hydraulic behaviour of cws 25 in order for these tracer tests to be effective the tracer used must be conservative i e should not be consumed or degraded 26 the tracer should also not be susceptible to biological chemical or photochemical decay should be highly soluble in water and should be easily detectable and not exist at high background levels within the system it is also assumed that for any experiment run that the tracer flow behaviour is similar to a normal effluent liquid 27 the main different tracer techniques are discussed here 2 1 impulse response tracer tests the type of tracer study most commonly used to determine the hydrodynamic behaviour of a cw is the impulse response test 22 28 for conducting an impulse response test a small volume of highly concentrated tracer solution is injected instantaneously equivalent to a mathematical impulse function into the inlet of the system and the concentration of the tracer is measured at the effluent at regular time intervals 23 in fig 1 a graphical representation of the concentration time response at the inlet a and outlet b can be seen the very short impulse is observed to spread or disperse through any system if the resulting distribution is normal gaussian the flow is normally ideal the shape of the distribution can tell the experimenter many things if it is bi or multi modal two or more peaks it can indicate bypass if it has a very long tail it can indicate dead zones as the tracer bleeds back from the dead zone into the outlet the residence time distribution function e t which is a quantitative description of how much time the fluid particles have spent in the reactor can be obtained from concentration time data of the impulse response curve and is given by eq 1 the assumption for eq 1 is that the inlet volumetric flow rate of the system is constant e t is calculated using the area under the concentration time curve which to normalize the distribution the area under the e t time curve is unity the calculation of e t is important as the first step towards calculating the moments of the distribution i e the first moment is the mean of the rtd the second moment is the spread of the distribution these are discussed further later in this paper 1 e t c t 0 c t d t two of the problems associated with an impulse response tracer study is ensuring that the injection of tracer takes places over a period of time which is short compared to the residence time of the system and ensuring negligible dispersion of the tracer between the point of injection and the feed to the system early truncation of an impulse response tracer study can lead to inaccuracies as this method is sensitive to the concentration time data at the tail of the response curve when conducting these experiments it is important to ensure this doesn t happen however if early truncation does occur then the researcher can extrapolate the tail of the response curve a further major obstacle with the impulse response tracer test is that the same concentration may occur at various times i e on the way towards the peak s and on the way down from the peak s this means that the actual time a molecule has spent in the reactor is not known and rather there are probabilities of time that reactants spend in the reactor 2 2 step change tracer tests the other primary type of tracer study is a step change response test for this experiment a constant rate of tracer is fed into the system starting at t 0 the concentration of this tracer must be significantly higher than the background concentration and easy to identify analytically the effluent concentration is monitored at regular time intervals 29 until the outlet concentration is stable and equal to that of the inlet this will only happen if the tracer is conservative if not the outlet will reach a steady state value a graphical representation of the concentration time behaviour of the typical inlet and outlet response of step change tracer tests is shown in fig 2 from the concentration time data of the step change response experiment the cumulative distribution f t can be obtained f t is described as the fraction of effluent that has been in the system for less than time t the mathematical definition of the cumulation distribution is given in eq 2 23 f t can also be considered the normalised response to the step input 2 f t c o u t c i n l e t s t e p the f t and e t curves are mathematically related similarly the cumulative distribution function is necessary to calculate parameters such as mean residence time and dispersion some of the challenges associated with step change response tracer studies include difficulty maintaining a constant feed concentration a large amount of tracer is required to do this and the analysis of step change response data involves differential mathematics rather than integral mathematics this can result in lead to large errors and a serious increase in noise in the data the slope of the response curve is being measured rather than the area underneath it 23 by measuring the slope the data is much more sensitive to analytical uncertainty one of the benefits of this type of study however is that it is not necessary to know the total amount of tracer added to the system as it tends towards a known steady state outlet the relationship between the residence time distribution function e t and the cumulative distribution function is given in eq 3 this integral relationship allows for the conversion from impulse response data to step change response data if desired 3 0 t e t d t f t 2 3 square input tracer tests square input tracer tests are uncommon and not well covered in the literature in this form of tracer study the feed concentration is increased from 0 to a significantly higher and measurable concentration at t 0 and then at a t t the feed concentration is stepped back down to 0 giraldi et al 2009 used a square input tracer test when conducting tracer tests on vf cws to determine the hydrodynamics in different saturation conditions 30 the square input signal was artificially extended to take the form of a step change input signal using eq 4 where c t is the normalized tracer concentration and t is the time and where the dosing of tracer for the square input was stopped in other words it is essentially a double step change one up and one down 4 f t c t t t f t c t f t t t t 2 4 tracer options there are many options of tracers available which include but are not limited to salt ions fluorescent dyes and stable isotopes or a combination of these of tracers all of these options have been used by researchers conducting tracer tests in cws 2 4 1 salt tracers salt tracers also known as ionic tracers are considered to be effective for studying the hydraulic behaviour of cws as they are easily soluble and are unlikely to interact with the biota of the system 31 sodium chloride is one of the most common salt tracers and has been used by many researchers heiderscheidt et al 2020 used it to determine the residence time under frozen and frost free conditions of an unplanted peat based pilot scale cw 32 sun et al 2019 used it to determine hydraulic parameters of an hf 33 and hua et al made use of the tracer to investigate the effect of clogging and resting processes on the flow behaviour of a vf cw 34 in all three studies the researchers measured the electrical conductivity ec at the outlet of the cw and based on a linear correlation between ec and the concentration of sodium chloride determined the concentration of the tracer at the outlet of the system one study used lithium as a tracer to validate the hydraulic model used in cwm1 retraso mechanistic model in the simulation of an hf cw 2 while another used lithium chloride to test the effect of inlet configuration and vegetation type on the hydraulic performance of 18 fws cws 35 in the latter study atomic spectrophotometry was used to analyse the concentration of li ions after hno3 was added for sample preservation and kcl was added as an ionization suppressant potassium iodide was used by a group of researchers to determine the hydraulic behaviour of drained peatlands 36 analysis of the tracer test samples was done using an iodine selective electrode to determine the concentration of iodide 36 one of the limitations of salt tracers is that the salt solutions typically have higher densities than the cw water 35 and so a halocline could be formed this results in the stratification of fluid which prevents mixing and is thermodynamically metastable density induced stratification may be enhanced by low flow velocities 37 special care needs to be taken especially in the case of impulse response tracer tests to ensure that salt tracer settling does not take place density differences are also affected by temperature but in fws cws the temperature difference from top to bottom is approximately 1 c which is not considered enough to create stratification 10 any temperatures differences greater than this may cause a problem 35 when choosing a salt tracer choosing one with ions that have minimal interaction with the system is important for example cl and li are good ionic tracers but no3 will be degraded in the system and therefore is not a conservative tracer it is also important to consider the charge of the ion and the charge of the cw medium to ensure minimal interaction between the two analytical methods most commonly used for salt tracers are electrical conductivity and ion chromatography and in some cases atomic absorption spectrophotometry electrical conductivity is a cheap and effective method of analysis and can be used as a proxy for rapidly determining the concentration of ions in the system 2 4 2 fluorescent tracers the use of fluorescent tracers in the rtd studies of cws is common fluorescent dyes such as fluorescein and rhodamine are inexpensive easy to handle and easy to detect 38 one study used rhodamine wt to evaluate hydraulic behaviour and performance indicators of various cws designs and from this information the researchers were able to choose the optimum design from the systems tested on 39 an inline optical fluorometer ysi 6130 rwt sensor installed on a ysi multi parameter water quality sonde was used to determine the concentration of tracer at the outlet guo et al 2019 used rhodamine wt to determine the residence time and other hydraulic parameters of a tundra cw and from this were able to determine first order rate constants of the contaminants which can be used to further improve the cw design 40 another common fluorescent dye tracer is uranine pálfy et al 2017 used uranine to determine the hydraulic behaviour of a cw treating combined sewer overflow and from this information the researchers were able to identify short circuiting as a limitation of the system 41 in this study an inline fluorometer ggun fl932 was calibrated and used to determine and record the concentration of tracer at the outlet laurent et al 2015 used uranine and sulforhodamine b to successfully determine the hydrodynamic behaviour of three fws cws 42 an inline fluorometer ggun fl30 was calibrated for both tracers and used to determine and record outlet concentrations these dyes are for the most part conservative but have the potential to adsorb onto certain materials are susceptible to photodegradation and biodegradation and can be ph sensitive 31 43 2 4 3 combinations of different types of tracers a combination of two or more types of tracers is being trialled by cw researchers for rtd studies different tracers have different diffusion coefficients and this allows researchers to determine the presence and location of stagnant zones and diffusion dominated transport processes 44 birkigt et al 2018 conducted a multi tracer rtd experiment using bromide uranine and deuterium oxide to determine the flow behaviour in three dimensions of a pilot scale hf cw 45 the method of analysis for each of these tracers was different ion chromatography was used to determine the concentration of bromide a fluorescence fluorometer was used to determine the concentration of uranine and high temperature pyrolysis was used to determine the concentration of deuterium 45 from this research it was noted that bromide and deuterium oxide had similar behaviour and the data from the tracer studies yielded similar hydraulic parameters while uranine displayed different hydraulic behaviour it was suggested that there was a lag in the response of uranine was due to organic matter in the system mailard et al 2016 used bromide uranine and sulforhodamine b as tracers to determine the impact of batch versus continuous flow modes on the dissipation of the chiral herbicide s metolachlor in a cw 46 these researchers found that plant uptake sorption and photodegradation are greater in batch mode operation that continuous flow operation but the extent for each tracer was slightly different bromide was most susceptible to plant uptake uranine was most susceptible to photodegradation and sulforhodamine b was most susceptible to sorption 46 in this case the methods of analysis were ion chromatography for bromide and fluorescence spectrometry for both the sulforhodamine b and uranine pugliese et al 2020 used uranine and potassium bromide as conservative tracers to study the hydraulic behaviour of a shallow deep compartment designed fws cw and were able to identify the presence of multiple flow paths and internal mixing in shallow zones 47 montalván et al 2017 used natural tracers cl br na mg2 and environmental isotopes 18o 2h 14c 13c and 3h to estimate residence times of brine waters and identify recharge areas of the different flow subsystems in a hypersaline cw 48 the environmental isotopes were analysed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry and the natural tracers were analysed using pte ag 48 bruun et al used bromide and tritium in the form of 3h2o to investigate intra granular diffusion in a woodchip based hf cw 49 this study indicated that there may be a slight anion exclusion on bromine in the wood chip matrix ion chromatography was used to analyse the concentration of bromide ions and liquid scintillation counting was used to analyse the concentration for tritium 49 2 4 4 other tracer options while the tracer types mentioned above are the more common a few others have been used bonner et al 2017 developed a mapping methodology for the use of heat as a conservative tracer in hf cws the researchers were able to accurately quantify the hydraulic parameters of the system being tested on from the mapped heat tracer response it was shown that if certain parameters of transport can be determined then this technique can be used one different study used stable isotope ratios of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h in water to study the hydrology of forested cws 50 through this the researchers were able to identify the contribution of surface water and rainwater to three different cw systems and the extent of surface evaporation liquid water isotope analyzer was used to determine the concentration of δ18o andδ2h abu bakar et al 2017 investigated the use of microbial tracers and in this study the researchers calibrated and validated the transport and decay of four microbial tracers and used the data to refine a model for better water quality processes in a macro tidal coastal basin modelling the decay of the microbial tracers proved to be more computationally intensive than the researchers expected so the technique is not considered useful for design 51 3 techniques used for interpretation and analysis of the residence time distribution in an ideal plug flow system all fluid atoms elements move through the cw with the same velocity and reach the system outlet at the same time this exit time is the simplest way to account for time in a cw and is called the nominal residence time τ which is defined in equation 5 22 the nominal residence time is only a function of volumetric flow and cw volume and is an intrinsic parameter of any reactor this method does not account for any non idealities in the flow through the cw system and a tracer test is not required to determine the nominal residence time owing to the non ideal nature of cw hydraulic behaviour the nominal residence time is not considered sufficient to characterise cw flow behaviour 5 τ v q 3 1 method of moments in the method of moments technique for interpreting rtd data three parameters are determined the mass recovery the mean residence time and the variance the mass recovery of tracer in an rtd study is important especially in an impulse response study as many parameters used to quantify the hydraulic behaviour of a system are determined based on the assumption of total mass recovery mass recovery of the tracer of 80 or higher is considered acceptable 22 the percentage of mass recovery of conservative tracer in a tracer study is considered the zeroth moment of the rtd the mass recovery can be calculated using equation 6 52 6 m o u t 0 q o u t t c o u t t d t the first moment of the rtd study is the centroid of the response curve and is called the mean residence time tm which is the average amount of time that the fluid particles have spent in the reactor this can be calculated using eq 7 for impulse response tracer studies and eq 8 for step change response tracer studies 7 t m 0 t e t d t 0 e t d t 8 t m 0 1 f t d t the second moment of the rtd is the variance the variance is an indication of the spread of the impulse as it passes through the reactor eq 9 and eq 10 give the equation used to determine the variance from an impulse response and step change tracer study respectively the variance indicates the global mixing in the system 30 9 σ 2 0 t t m 2 e t d t 10 σ 2 2 0 t 1 f t d t t m 2 dimensionless variance is calculated using eq 11 the dimensionless variance indicates local mixing 11 σ 2 0 σ 2 t m 2 another factor that is often considered but is not part of the method of moments is the effective volume utilisation the mean residence time tm can be compared to the nominal residence time τ to provide the effective volume utilisation e this is given in equation 12 35 the effective volume utilisation is a function of aspect ratio 53 positioning of inlet and outlet ports 24 plant position and root density 54 as well as the extent of clogging in the system due to biofilm growth 55 12 e t m τ one of the limitations of the method of moments is that the anomalies in the tail of the impulse response tracer test can lead to incorrect estimation of parameters and curve fitting 10 early truncation of the tail can also lead to an underestimation of the mean residence time 56 this is especially important for packed bed reactors such as cws where even those with close to ideal flow have a gaussian distribution with a long tail 57 the long tail can lead to substantial error in the calculation of the mean of the rtd the method of moments technique can be used for fws hf and vf cws as no assumption about the direction or the saturation of the flow has been made the methods of moments technique was used in a study by holland et al 2004 to determine the sensitivity of a normalised rtd to varying flow rate and depths 52 the researchers found that while the normalised rtds were the same for different flow rates the water depth influenced the rtd 52 one group of researchers investigated the influence of the method of rtd analysis on pollutant removal estimations and hydraulic parameters by comparing the method of moments with other analysis techniques these researchers found that the method of analysis affected the calculation of hydraulic parameters related to mixing more than other hydraulic parameters and removal predictions in the same study the effect of rtd truncation on hydraulic parameters was also investigated and in this section of the study the researchers noted that the truncation of tracer experiments at 3τ resulted in the overestimation of the effective volume utilisation another group used the method of moments to investigate the difference in hydraulic parameters of cws constructed on previously drained peatlands compared to pristine cws these researchers found that in the case of the cws built on previously drained peatlands the full volume was not being used effectively 36 it has been indicated that a disadvantage of using the method of moments technique is that a single mean residence time tm can describe an infinite number of distributions thereby stating that there is a loss of information when determining other parameters such as dispersion from the mean residence time 58 the methods of moments technique is also sensitive to non continuous data sets 35 the benefit of the method of moments technique is that the values of the hydraulic parameters can be obtained directly from the measured data 35 the method of moments technique has been used to investigate the hydraulic behaviour of both large scale cws and pilot scale cws 36 59 60 as this technique is based directly on data from tracer studies and no assumptions are made about the system it can be used for cws of any size as long as enough tracer has been added 3 2 tanks in series model the tanks in series model is a reactor model and is a gamma distribution of residence times the model is given in equation 13 10 in this model the results from the tracer test either step change or impulse response are analysed to determine how many continuously stirred equally sized tank reactors in series would provide the same response curve as the experiment cw curve the number of tanks in series n is determined using equation 14 61 when n 1 there is a large degree of back mixing and the cw is considered to behave as a cstr and can be modelled as such as n tends to infinity the degree of back mixing tends to zero and the behaviour of the cw tends to that of an ideal plug flow reactor pfr and can be modelled as such ideal plug flow conditions are considered optimal for wastewater treatment as the total water volume of the cws is considered to be treated the particles all flow through the system at the same velocity and therefore reach the outlet in the same amount of time 61 based on reported literature values kadlec wallace 2009 estimated that n 4 1 0 4 for fwscws and n 11 0 1 2 for hf cws 10 13 e t t n 1 n 1 τ i n e x p t τ i 14 n t m 2 σ 2 from the number of tanks in series another factor can be determined the hydraulic efficiency which is defined in eq 15 hydraulic efficiency is a measure that can be used to compare different cw designs 62 it considers the effective volume utilisation e as well as the degree of mixing by making use of n 15 λ e 1 1 n one study used the tanks in series model to investigate the hydraulic behaviour of three large scale fws cws and it was determined that the vegetation density had a large effect on the dispersion of the system 42 another study used the tanks in series model with an exchange between active and dead zones to simulate the rtd of an hf cw 63 from this model the researchers were able to determine the optimum inlet flow rate and water level in the cw being studied the tanks in series model can be used for fws and hf cws as in these systems the flow is saturated the variably saturated flow which is common in vf cws makes the use of this model more challenging but under saturated conditions the model can be used it is also applicable to cws of various sizes laurent et al 2015 used the tanks in series model on 3 systems with areas ranging from 63 m2 to 750 m2 42 while persson wittgren 2003 used this model on a pilot scale cw 63 3 3 advective dispersive transport equation the advective dispersive transport equation has been used by many researchers to describe solute transport and flow in cws unlike the tanks in series model which is a reactor model the advective dispersive transport is a flow based equation in this methodology the physical processes of advection which refers to the transport of solute caused by the bulk flow of fluid and dispersion which refers to the transport of solute particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration are included within the transport model 64 advection is usually the dominant process for solute transport in groundwater 65 the advective dispersive transport equation is valid for solute transport in systems with impermeable boundaries after the initial mixing period in which the solute is fully mixed with the inlet fluid the model assumes that the solute is fully dissolved and therefore has the same average velocity as the fluid 66 the advective dispersive transport model with retardation and decay quantifies the hydrodynamic dispersion of a single soluble species which undergoes both decay and retardation it is assumed that the porous media is homogeneous isotropic and that the medium is saturated the flow is steady state and darcy s law applies 67 darcy s law is a model for fluid flow through porous media which states that s linear momentum is conserved and that there is a directly proportional relationship between inlet flow rate fluid viscosity and pressure drop over a given distance 68 this partial differential equation can be used to describe the movement of a chemical tracer in subsurface media and is given in eq 16 μ and γ are the first order decay coefficient and zero order production constant respectively and can be used for non conservative reactive chemical tracers 69 r a chemical retardation factor is included in the transport equation and is provided in eq 17 this retardation factor includes a distribution coefficient kd which indicates the ratio of solute concentration in the solid and the liquid 70 a kd value close to 0 is considered non sorbing and an increase in the kd value indicates a larger sorbing tendency the value depends on the physical characteristics of the tracer and in some cases the sub surface media d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient and is a measure of describing the mixing of solutes in porous media 71 16 r c t d 2 c x 2 u c t μ c γ 17 r 1 ρ b k d ε the advective dispersive transport equation is based on assumptions of saturated flow and porous media this means that the use of this equation is limited to systems with sub surface media and saturated flow which in the case of cws is most commonly hf cws however the size of the cw is not a limiting factor for this model it has been used on both large scale cws and pilot scale cws 72 74 one study used an analytically solved form of the advective dispersive transport equation developed by ogata banks 1961 75 to determine changing hydraulic parameters due to biological growth of two hf cws with different filter mediums 72 the study found that biological growth decreased the drainable porosity but had a negligible effect on hydraulic conductivity and that selecting a coarse filter medium could mitigate clogging caused by biological growth 72 another study used the advection dispersion transport equation for simulation based design of a cw to determine the optimal size under specific conditions 12 from the simulation the researchers determined that quantifying ambient temperature effluent release and recycle streams were more important than precipitation and evaporation when determining the optimum size of a cw a third study used a two dimensional depth averaged hydrodynamic mode combined with the advective dispersive transport model on an hf cw to account for the effect of vegetation on the hydrodynamics in cws 73 the model in this study was able to predict the bimodality of the rtd response when this hydraulic behaviour was due to two different flow channels the main flow channel and vegetated zones moutsopoulos et al 2011 used the advective dispersive transport equation to simulate the hydraulic performance and nitrogen transformation of hf cw 74 from this model the researchers were able to simulate nitrogen transport and decay accurately in unplanted systems but found that the extra complexity introduced by vegetation in a planted system either because of the root zone or uptake of ammonia by the roots proved to be less accurate and required further investigation 3 4 richard s equation richard s equation is a partial differential equation which is used to describe unsaturated flow in a non porous medium and is defined according to eq 18 30 the relationship between pressure head h hydraulic conductivity k and water content θ are described according to van genuchten mualem functions eq 19 and eq 20 76 this equation is commonly used to describe the water flow in vf cws as they are often intermittently loaded and therefore the flow is variable saturated and dynamic 77 richard s equation forms one of the partial differential equations in the hydrus wetland model executed in hydrus software which is one of the most detailed process based models currently available 77 many researchers have made use of this model to successfully validate and investigate the processes taking place in cws 78 79 18 θ t z k h z 1 19 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α h 1 1 m m h 0 θ θ s h 0 20 k k s θ θ r θ s θ r 0 5 1 1 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 m m 2 h 0 k k s h 0 3 5 vart model variable residence time vart model was initially developed as a model for longitudinal dispersion and solute transport in streams 80 it is based on a double layer conceptual model the upper layer is dominated by advection transient storage and the lower layer is a diffusion dominated storage zone 80 the model is used for fws cws because they have the same double layer that is conceptualised for the vart model additionally streams and fws cws have similar transient storage zones 81 the vart model has been used to compute the hydraulic residence time of cws filled with two different mediums and was able to accurately predict the rtd for design purposes 11 the model was combined with kinetic processes to simulate the removal of total phosphorus and ammonium 82 and bod 83 in fws cws and it was found that there was a good simulation of the three contaminants and the combined model is considered an efficient tool for designing cws and understanding the effects of various processes and mechanisms on the treatment of wastewater in cws 82 83 3 6 convolution integral the convolution integral can be used to describe the flow behaviour of a system this model is not based on physical flow processes but rather the experimental data obtained directly from tracer studies for this reason the convolution integral can be used to describe the flow behaviour of fws hf and vf cws sheridan et al 2014 used the convolution integral to determine the rate constants for the degradation of ethanol and a lumped parameter cod in winery effluent within an hf cw 84 these researchers found that because the rate constants obtained from the convolution integral are based directly on the rtd data they were more accurate than the rate constants determine using the other models investigated it is also possible to determine the conversion of a reactor regardless of the degree of non ideal behaviour directly from the tracer information for first order reactions the convolution integral derived by levenspiel 1999 is given in eq 21 57 21 c o u t t 0 t c i n t t e t d t it can be shown that eq 22 is an equivalent form of eq 21 22 c o u t t 0 t c i n t e t t d t the concise form is given in eq 23 23 c o u t t c i n e the usefulness of this method arises from the fact that no reactor model is assumed rather the unique data arising from the tracer test are directly utilised this also means that the convolution integral can be used for cws of any size this method was found to be significantly more accurate at modelling the reactor processes than the pfr or tanks in series models 4 discussion all the methods discussed in this paper have their advantages and disadvantages some are simple to use but do not provide detailed information about the interaction of hydraulic processes and biokinetic processes while others allow the researcher to investigate these interactions but at a high computational cost the choice of hydraulic depends on the need of the researcher fig 3 is a tool that researchers can use to aid the decision of which model to use if the researcher is looking to investigate the effect of changing design parameters of a cw on the mixing and the volume utilisation of a system then the method of moments or tanks in series model would be good choices if modelling the degradation of contaminants in wastewater and understanding the effect of hydraulic conditions on this degradation is the focus researchers could choose from the advective dispersive transport model vart model or richards equation as these are all typically combined with biokinetic models the type of cw being investigated will also influence the model used if the flow is unsaturated as is typical of a vf cw then richard s equation should be the hydraulic model of choice if the system being investigated is a fws cw then vart is the most appropriate of the models method of moments tanks in series model and the convolution integral can be used for all types of cws as they make no assumptions of the physical flow processes the vart model richard s equation and the advective dispersive transport equation do not require a tracer test although a tracer test to validate the results from these models is recommended this means that these models can be effective for design purposes before the system has been built 5 conclusion the modelling of cws had advanced a great deal in the last two decades and while there has been a larger focus of the biokinetic models the use of an effective hydraulic model is necessary for furthering research design and use of these systems cws are an effective form of wastewater treatment owing to the multiple processes taking place in parallel but this also makes them complex systems to model the modelling technique chosen is dependent on the aim of the researcher whether it is for understanding the effects of changing design parameters on hydraulic conditions and contaminant removal or if it is for research purposes and investigating the relationships between multiple processes one cannot avoid making use of a hydraulic model for either of these aims the effectiveness of a cw in treating wastewater is dependent on the time the water spends in the system and this time is dependent on the hydraulic behaviour of the cw it is for this vital reason that understanding and quantifying the hydraulic

13567,accurate modelling of constructed wetlands is vital for furthering the use of these systems constructed wetlands can treat various types of wastewater including domestic wastewater agricultural wastewater industrial and mining wastewater and stormwater runoff physical chemical and biological processes all take place simultaneously to breakdown the contaminants in wastewater and while the combination of so many processes makes them an effective wastewater treatment system it can also make the modelling of these systems intricate the modelling technique used is dependent on the goal of the model whether it is for design or scientific research the extent to which contaminants are broken down by these processes is highly dependent on the time the water spends in the system and this time is dependent on and can be quantified by the understanding of the hydraulic behaviour of the constructed wetland tracer studies are the most common way to determine the hydraulic behaviour of the system and the data from these studies can be used in various ways to quantify time in the system there are three aims of this paper the first is to give wetland researchers an idea of what hydraulic modelling techniques are available the second is to indicate the connection between accurate hydraulic modelling and the modelling of kinetic processes and the third is to guide the researchers in determining which model is best suited for their needs based on research needs and characteristics of the wetland keywords constructed wetlands hydraulic behaviour hydraulic modelling tracer studies 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws are low cost and low maintenance systems which have the ability to treat various types of wastewater including domestic wastewater 1 3 agricultural wastewater 4 5 and stormwater run off 6 to name a few 7 there are three main types of cws free water surface fws horizontal sub surface flow hf and vertical flow sub surface vf physical chemical and biological processes all take place simultaneously within the cws and in doing so reduce the pollutant load of the wastewater to use these systems as an effective form of wastewater treatment accurate design and modelling are required there are various cw design methodologies which are primarily linked to flow type they can include characteristics such as surface or subsurface flow vertical or horizontal flow and saturated or unsaturated flow 8 for these systems to be effective accurate design and modelling are required many studies have been conducted in the last three decades to improve the models with varying levels of complexity the problem with cw modelling is that the inherent complexity of the cw itself means that the model may require more time or computational power than is available or necessary under the circumstances 8 for the design of cws the models developed tend to be simpler and require less computational power than those developed for scientific research but they may not be as accurate 8 1 1 history of wetland modelling the original cw models developed were considered black box models which relied on empirical correlations between inlet and outlet concentrations 9 and were often developed for and could only be used for a very specific system correlations based on the surface area regression and first order models were used and inherent in these models is an assumption about the flow typically that there is ideal plug flow in the cw given the complexity of these systems and based on research conducted in recent years it can be said that this assumption does not hold and that these empirical correlation based models are not adequate to model cws subsequently modelling has advanced to mechanistic and process based models these models can be divided into two categories 1 models which describe the hydraulic behaviour of the cw in detail but assume simple kinetics or focus on the reactive transport of a single contaminant 2 models which describe the detailed reactive transport of a single or multiple contaminant s but assumes simplified or ideal hydraulic behaviour in both cases some simplifying assumptions have been made either with regards to reaction kinetics or hydraulic behaviour in recent years models have been developed which combine detailed modelling of both hydraulic behaviour and reaction kinetics these models typically require extensive computational power a specific software and a detailed understanding of numerical modelling cws are in essence a reactor and the extent of reaction is dependent on the time the fluid spends in the cw an investigation into the hydraulic behaviour of a cw allows for the determination of this time and subsequently the effectiveness of the system in reducing contaminant load therefore for cw models to be accurate the characterisation of hydraulic behaviour must be accurate the flow behaviour of a cw influences its ability to breakdown inlet contaminants 10 there is a distribution of flow velocities within the system and the combination of these gives the overall hydraulic behaviour of the system many investigations have found that there are 3 different hydraulic zones in cws the main flow path a temporary storage zone where components and water are exchanged with the main flow path and a dead zone 11 12 by investigating the hydraulic behaviour of a cw it is possible to indicate whether there are hindrances to ideal flow such as bypassing which is when a section of the fluid moves through the system much more quickly than the bulk of the fluid resulting in reduced time spent in the cw dead zones which are sections of in the system through which fluid does not flow and solute transport is due only to dispersion and mixing all these factors contribute to the time that wastewater spends in the cw known as the residence time this in turn relates to how long the water is in the system to break down organics convert nitrogen species and degrade other contaminants if a cw has poor hydraulic behaviour then pollutant removal will be poor and conversion for which the system was designed will not be achieved it is tempting to model the flow of a cw as an ideal plug flow reactor pfr in which every fluid particle moves through the reactor with the same velocity and has the same residence time however it has been shown by multiple researchers that the hydraulic behaviour of cws is far from this ideal case 13 14 the flow characteristics of cws are elaborate and non ideal owing to the changing root structure and the complicated flow pathway of fluid through gravel or soil matrix bonner et al 2017 factors such as cw shape 15 16 inlet and outlet location 17 18 and vegetation distribution 17 19 21 can affect the hydraulic behaviour of cws vegetation distribution is a variable barrier to flow in terms of the plant size shape and position as a result there is bypass and short circuiting around plant mass forming dead zones which leads to a hold up of water results zones with no reaction in certain areas the formation of different velocity profiles can lead to a distribution of residence times the shortest time is experienced by the water moving at the maximum velocity in the profile which would normally be in the surface layer of the micro channels with the longest times experienced by water that moves near drag inducing surfaces such as the cw bottom 13 there are various techniques and models which exists for the characterisation of the hydraulic behaviour of cws and the solute transport in the systems these include the method of moments technique the tanks in series reactor model the advection dispersion transport equation etc a review of the experimental methods used to obtain hydraulic characteristics the methods used to analyse the data from these experiments and the use of this data in process based models is the focus of this paper this information is important since the hydraulic characteristics determine the length of time the wastewater spends in the cw and the time determines the extent of treatment a guide to conducting investigating and modelling the hydraulic characteristics is included to aid the design and effective use of cws as a form of wastewater treatment 2 experimental procedures for understanding flow behaviour the most common way to characterise the flow patterns and assess the hydraulic behaviour of a cw is by conducting residence time distribution rtd studies 22 the residence time distribution of a reactor gives the probability of a fluid element spending a specific amount of time in the reactor and is characteristic of the mixing that occurs within the system 23 the rtd is obtained by running a flow tracer study on the system a flow tracer study is a stimulus response experiment in which an inert flow tracer is injected either as an impulse or as a step change in concentration into the system inlet pipe and the tracer concentration is measured continuously at the effluent an effective tracer study requires the flow to be laminar 24 if the data is to be successfully extrapolated scaled to other operational flow rates as long as they are also laminar data from these experiments are then used in rtd modelling methodologies to analyse the flow characteristics of the reactor and can be used to quantify a set of characteristics that describe the hydraulic behaviour of cws 25 in order for these tracer tests to be effective the tracer used must be conservative i e should not be consumed or degraded 26 the tracer should also not be susceptible to biological chemical or photochemical decay should be highly soluble in water and should be easily detectable and not exist at high background levels within the system it is also assumed that for any experiment run that the tracer flow behaviour is similar to a normal effluent liquid 27 the main different tracer techniques are discussed here 2 1 impulse response tracer tests the type of tracer study most commonly used to determine the hydrodynamic behaviour of a cw is the impulse response test 22 28 for conducting an impulse response test a small volume of highly concentrated tracer solution is injected instantaneously equivalent to a mathematical impulse function into the inlet of the system and the concentration of the tracer is measured at the effluent at regular time intervals 23 in fig 1 a graphical representation of the concentration time response at the inlet a and outlet b can be seen the very short impulse is observed to spread or disperse through any system if the resulting distribution is normal gaussian the flow is normally ideal the shape of the distribution can tell the experimenter many things if it is bi or multi modal two or more peaks it can indicate bypass if it has a very long tail it can indicate dead zones as the tracer bleeds back from the dead zone into the outlet the residence time distribution function e t which is a quantitative description of how much time the fluid particles have spent in the reactor can be obtained from concentration time data of the impulse response curve and is given by eq 1 the assumption for eq 1 is that the inlet volumetric flow rate of the system is constant e t is calculated using the area under the concentration time curve which to normalize the distribution the area under the e t time curve is unity the calculation of e t is important as the first step towards calculating the moments of the distribution i e the first moment is the mean of the rtd the second moment is the spread of the distribution these are discussed further later in this paper 1 e t c t 0 c t d t two of the problems associated with an impulse response tracer study is ensuring that the injection of tracer takes places over a period of time which is short compared to the residence time of the system and ensuring negligible dispersion of the tracer between the point of injection and the feed to the system early truncation of an impulse response tracer study can lead to inaccuracies as this method is sensitive to the concentration time data at the tail of the response curve when conducting these experiments it is important to ensure this doesn t happen however if early truncation does occur then the researcher can extrapolate the tail of the response curve a further major obstacle with the impulse response tracer test is that the same concentration may occur at various times i e on the way towards the peak s and on the way down from the peak s this means that the actual time a molecule has spent in the reactor is not known and rather there are probabilities of time that reactants spend in the reactor 2 2 step change tracer tests the other primary type of tracer study is a step change response test for this experiment a constant rate of tracer is fed into the system starting at t 0 the concentration of this tracer must be significantly higher than the background concentration and easy to identify analytically the effluent concentration is monitored at regular time intervals 29 until the outlet concentration is stable and equal to that of the inlet this will only happen if the tracer is conservative if not the outlet will reach a steady state value a graphical representation of the concentration time behaviour of the typical inlet and outlet response of step change tracer tests is shown in fig 2 from the concentration time data of the step change response experiment the cumulative distribution f t can be obtained f t is described as the fraction of effluent that has been in the system for less than time t the mathematical definition of the cumulation distribution is given in eq 2 23 f t can also be considered the normalised response to the step input 2 f t c o u t c i n l e t s t e p the f t and e t curves are mathematically related similarly the cumulative distribution function is necessary to calculate parameters such as mean residence time and dispersion some of the challenges associated with step change response tracer studies include difficulty maintaining a constant feed concentration a large amount of tracer is required to do this and the analysis of step change response data involves differential mathematics rather than integral mathematics this can result in lead to large errors and a serious increase in noise in the data the slope of the response curve is being measured rather than the area underneath it 23 by measuring the slope the data is much more sensitive to analytical uncertainty one of the benefits of this type of study however is that it is not necessary to know the total amount of tracer added to the system as it tends towards a known steady state outlet the relationship between the residence time distribution function e t and the cumulative distribution function is given in eq 3 this integral relationship allows for the conversion from impulse response data to step change response data if desired 3 0 t e t d t f t 2 3 square input tracer tests square input tracer tests are uncommon and not well covered in the literature in this form of tracer study the feed concentration is increased from 0 to a significantly higher and measurable concentration at t 0 and then at a t t the feed concentration is stepped back down to 0 giraldi et al 2009 used a square input tracer test when conducting tracer tests on vf cws to determine the hydrodynamics in different saturation conditions 30 the square input signal was artificially extended to take the form of a step change input signal using eq 4 where c t is the normalized tracer concentration and t is the time and where the dosing of tracer for the square input was stopped in other words it is essentially a double step change one up and one down 4 f t c t t t f t c t f t t t t 2 4 tracer options there are many options of tracers available which include but are not limited to salt ions fluorescent dyes and stable isotopes or a combination of these of tracers all of these options have been used by researchers conducting tracer tests in cws 2 4 1 salt tracers salt tracers also known as ionic tracers are considered to be effective for studying the hydraulic behaviour of cws as they are easily soluble and are unlikely to interact with the biota of the system 31 sodium chloride is one of the most common salt tracers and has been used by many researchers heiderscheidt et al 2020 used it to determine the residence time under frozen and frost free conditions of an unplanted peat based pilot scale cw 32 sun et al 2019 used it to determine hydraulic parameters of an hf 33 and hua et al made use of the tracer to investigate the effect of clogging and resting processes on the flow behaviour of a vf cw 34 in all three studies the researchers measured the electrical conductivity ec at the outlet of the cw and based on a linear correlation between ec and the concentration of sodium chloride determined the concentration of the tracer at the outlet of the system one study used lithium as a tracer to validate the hydraulic model used in cwm1 retraso mechanistic model in the simulation of an hf cw 2 while another used lithium chloride to test the effect of inlet configuration and vegetation type on the hydraulic performance of 18 fws cws 35 in the latter study atomic spectrophotometry was used to analyse the concentration of li ions after hno3 was added for sample preservation and kcl was added as an ionization suppressant potassium iodide was used by a group of researchers to determine the hydraulic behaviour of drained peatlands 36 analysis of the tracer test samples was done using an iodine selective electrode to determine the concentration of iodide 36 one of the limitations of salt tracers is that the salt solutions typically have higher densities than the cw water 35 and so a halocline could be formed this results in the stratification of fluid which prevents mixing and is thermodynamically metastable density induced stratification may be enhanced by low flow velocities 37 special care needs to be taken especially in the case of impulse response tracer tests to ensure that salt tracer settling does not take place density differences are also affected by temperature but in fws cws the temperature difference from top to bottom is approximately 1 c which is not considered enough to create stratification 10 any temperatures differences greater than this may cause a problem 35 when choosing a salt tracer choosing one with ions that have minimal interaction with the system is important for example cl and li are good ionic tracers but no3 will be degraded in the system and therefore is not a conservative tracer it is also important to consider the charge of the ion and the charge of the cw medium to ensure minimal interaction between the two analytical methods most commonly used for salt tracers are electrical conductivity and ion chromatography and in some cases atomic absorption spectrophotometry electrical conductivity is a cheap and effective method of analysis and can be used as a proxy for rapidly determining the concentration of ions in the system 2 4 2 fluorescent tracers the use of fluorescent tracers in the rtd studies of cws is common fluorescent dyes such as fluorescein and rhodamine are inexpensive easy to handle and easy to detect 38 one study used rhodamine wt to evaluate hydraulic behaviour and performance indicators of various cws designs and from this information the researchers were able to choose the optimum design from the systems tested on 39 an inline optical fluorometer ysi 6130 rwt sensor installed on a ysi multi parameter water quality sonde was used to determine the concentration of tracer at the outlet guo et al 2019 used rhodamine wt to determine the residence time and other hydraulic parameters of a tundra cw and from this were able to determine first order rate constants of the contaminants which can be used to further improve the cw design 40 another common fluorescent dye tracer is uranine pálfy et al 2017 used uranine to determine the hydraulic behaviour of a cw treating combined sewer overflow and from this information the researchers were able to identify short circuiting as a limitation of the system 41 in this study an inline fluorometer ggun fl932 was calibrated and used to determine and record the concentration of tracer at the outlet laurent et al 2015 used uranine and sulforhodamine b to successfully determine the hydrodynamic behaviour of three fws cws 42 an inline fluorometer ggun fl30 was calibrated for both tracers and used to determine and record outlet concentrations these dyes are for the most part conservative but have the potential to adsorb onto certain materials are susceptible to photodegradation and biodegradation and can be ph sensitive 31 43 2 4 3 combinations of different types of tracers a combination of two or more types of tracers is being trialled by cw researchers for rtd studies different tracers have different diffusion coefficients and this allows researchers to determine the presence and location of stagnant zones and diffusion dominated transport processes 44 birkigt et al 2018 conducted a multi tracer rtd experiment using bromide uranine and deuterium oxide to determine the flow behaviour in three dimensions of a pilot scale hf cw 45 the method of analysis for each of these tracers was different ion chromatography was used to determine the concentration of bromide a fluorescence fluorometer was used to determine the concentration of uranine and high temperature pyrolysis was used to determine the concentration of deuterium 45 from this research it was noted that bromide and deuterium oxide had similar behaviour and the data from the tracer studies yielded similar hydraulic parameters while uranine displayed different hydraulic behaviour it was suggested that there was a lag in the response of uranine was due to organic matter in the system mailard et al 2016 used bromide uranine and sulforhodamine b as tracers to determine the impact of batch versus continuous flow modes on the dissipation of the chiral herbicide s metolachlor in a cw 46 these researchers found that plant uptake sorption and photodegradation are greater in batch mode operation that continuous flow operation but the extent for each tracer was slightly different bromide was most susceptible to plant uptake uranine was most susceptible to photodegradation and sulforhodamine b was most susceptible to sorption 46 in this case the methods of analysis were ion chromatography for bromide and fluorescence spectrometry for both the sulforhodamine b and uranine pugliese et al 2020 used uranine and potassium bromide as conservative tracers to study the hydraulic behaviour of a shallow deep compartment designed fws cw and were able to identify the presence of multiple flow paths and internal mixing in shallow zones 47 montalván et al 2017 used natural tracers cl br na mg2 and environmental isotopes 18o 2h 14c 13c and 3h to estimate residence times of brine waters and identify recharge areas of the different flow subsystems in a hypersaline cw 48 the environmental isotopes were analysed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry and the natural tracers were analysed using pte ag 48 bruun et al used bromide and tritium in the form of 3h2o to investigate intra granular diffusion in a woodchip based hf cw 49 this study indicated that there may be a slight anion exclusion on bromine in the wood chip matrix ion chromatography was used to analyse the concentration of bromide ions and liquid scintillation counting was used to analyse the concentration for tritium 49 2 4 4 other tracer options while the tracer types mentioned above are the more common a few others have been used bonner et al 2017 developed a mapping methodology for the use of heat as a conservative tracer in hf cws the researchers were able to accurately quantify the hydraulic parameters of the system being tested on from the mapped heat tracer response it was shown that if certain parameters of transport can be determined then this technique can be used one different study used stable isotope ratios of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h in water to study the hydrology of forested cws 50 through this the researchers were able to identify the contribution of surface water and rainwater to three different cw systems and the extent of surface evaporation liquid water isotope analyzer was used to determine the concentration of δ18o andδ2h abu bakar et al 2017 investigated the use of microbial tracers and in this study the researchers calibrated and validated the transport and decay of four microbial tracers and used the data to refine a model for better water quality processes in a macro tidal coastal basin modelling the decay of the microbial tracers proved to be more computationally intensive than the researchers expected so the technique is not considered useful for design 51 3 techniques used for interpretation and analysis of the residence time distribution in an ideal plug flow system all fluid atoms elements move through the cw with the same velocity and reach the system outlet at the same time this exit time is the simplest way to account for time in a cw and is called the nominal residence time τ which is defined in equation 5 22 the nominal residence time is only a function of volumetric flow and cw volume and is an intrinsic parameter of any reactor this method does not account for any non idealities in the flow through the cw system and a tracer test is not required to determine the nominal residence time owing to the non ideal nature of cw hydraulic behaviour the nominal residence time is not considered sufficient to characterise cw flow behaviour 5 τ v q 3 1 method of moments in the method of moments technique for interpreting rtd data three parameters are determined the mass recovery the mean residence time and the variance the mass recovery of tracer in an rtd study is important especially in an impulse response study as many parameters used to quantify the hydraulic behaviour of a system are determined based on the assumption of total mass recovery mass recovery of the tracer of 80 or higher is considered acceptable 22 the percentage of mass recovery of conservative tracer in a tracer study is considered the zeroth moment of the rtd the mass recovery can be calculated using equation 6 52 6 m o u t 0 q o u t t c o u t t d t the first moment of the rtd study is the centroid of the response curve and is called the mean residence time tm which is the average amount of time that the fluid particles have spent in the reactor this can be calculated using eq 7 for impulse response tracer studies and eq 8 for step change response tracer studies 7 t m 0 t e t d t 0 e t d t 8 t m 0 1 f t d t the second moment of the rtd is the variance the variance is an indication of the spread of the impulse as it passes through the reactor eq 9 and eq 10 give the equation used to determine the variance from an impulse response and step change tracer study respectively the variance indicates the global mixing in the system 30 9 σ 2 0 t t m 2 e t d t 10 σ 2 2 0 t 1 f t d t t m 2 dimensionless variance is calculated using eq 11 the dimensionless variance indicates local mixing 11 σ 2 0 σ 2 t m 2 another factor that is often considered but is not part of the method of moments is the effective volume utilisation the mean residence time tm can be compared to the nominal residence time τ to provide the effective volume utilisation e this is given in equation 12 35 the effective volume utilisation is a function of aspect ratio 53 positioning of inlet and outlet ports 24 plant position and root density 54 as well as the extent of clogging in the system due to biofilm growth 55 12 e t m τ one of the limitations of the method of moments is that the anomalies in the tail of the impulse response tracer test can lead to incorrect estimation of parameters and curve fitting 10 early truncation of the tail can also lead to an underestimation of the mean residence time 56 this is especially important for packed bed reactors such as cws where even those with close to ideal flow have a gaussian distribution with a long tail 57 the long tail can lead to substantial error in the calculation of the mean of the rtd the method of moments technique can be used for fws hf and vf cws as no assumption about the direction or the saturation of the flow has been made the methods of moments technique was used in a study by holland et al 2004 to determine the sensitivity of a normalised rtd to varying flow rate and depths 52 the researchers found that while the normalised rtds were the same for different flow rates the water depth influenced the rtd 52 one group of researchers investigated the influence of the method of rtd analysis on pollutant removal estimations and hydraulic parameters by comparing the method of moments with other analysis techniques these researchers found that the method of analysis affected the calculation of hydraulic parameters related to mixing more than other hydraulic parameters and removal predictions in the same study the effect of rtd truncation on hydraulic parameters was also investigated and in this section of the study the researchers noted that the truncation of tracer experiments at 3τ resulted in the overestimation of the effective volume utilisation another group used the method of moments to investigate the difference in hydraulic parameters of cws constructed on previously drained peatlands compared to pristine cws these researchers found that in the case of the cws built on previously drained peatlands the full volume was not being used effectively 36 it has been indicated that a disadvantage of using the method of moments technique is that a single mean residence time tm can describe an infinite number of distributions thereby stating that there is a loss of information when determining other parameters such as dispersion from the mean residence time 58 the methods of moments technique is also sensitive to non continuous data sets 35 the benefit of the method of moments technique is that the values of the hydraulic parameters can be obtained directly from the measured data 35 the method of moments technique has been used to investigate the hydraulic behaviour of both large scale cws and pilot scale cws 36 59 60 as this technique is based directly on data from tracer studies and no assumptions are made about the system it can be used for cws of any size as long as enough tracer has been added 3 2 tanks in series model the tanks in series model is a reactor model and is a gamma distribution of residence times the model is given in equation 13 10 in this model the results from the tracer test either step change or impulse response are analysed to determine how many continuously stirred equally sized tank reactors in series would provide the same response curve as the experiment cw curve the number of tanks in series n is determined using equation 14 61 when n 1 there is a large degree of back mixing and the cw is considered to behave as a cstr and can be modelled as such as n tends to infinity the degree of back mixing tends to zero and the behaviour of the cw tends to that of an ideal plug flow reactor pfr and can be modelled as such ideal plug flow conditions are considered optimal for wastewater treatment as the total water volume of the cws is considered to be treated the particles all flow through the system at the same velocity and therefore reach the outlet in the same amount of time 61 based on reported literature values kadlec wallace 2009 estimated that n 4 1 0 4 for fwscws and n 11 0 1 2 for hf cws 10 13 e t t n 1 n 1 τ i n e x p t τ i 14 n t m 2 σ 2 from the number of tanks in series another factor can be determined the hydraulic efficiency which is defined in eq 15 hydraulic efficiency is a measure that can be used to compare different cw designs 62 it considers the effective volume utilisation e as well as the degree of mixing by making use of n 15 λ e 1 1 n one study used the tanks in series model to investigate the hydraulic behaviour of three large scale fws cws and it was determined that the vegetation density had a large effect on the dispersion of the system 42 another study used the tanks in series model with an exchange between active and dead zones to simulate the rtd of an hf cw 63 from this model the researchers were able to determine the optimum inlet flow rate and water level in the cw being studied the tanks in series model can be used for fws and hf cws as in these systems the flow is saturated the variably saturated flow which is common in vf cws makes the use of this model more challenging but under saturated conditions the model can be used it is also applicable to cws of various sizes laurent et al 2015 used the tanks in series model on 3 systems with areas ranging from 63 m2 to 750 m2 42 while persson wittgren 2003 used this model on a pilot scale cw 63 3 3 advective dispersive transport equation the advective dispersive transport equation has been used by many researchers to describe solute transport and flow in cws unlike the tanks in series model which is a reactor model the advective dispersive transport is a flow based equation in this methodology the physical processes of advection which refers to the transport of solute caused by the bulk flow of fluid and dispersion which refers to the transport of solute particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration are included within the transport model 64 advection is usually the dominant process for solute transport in groundwater 65 the advective dispersive transport equation is valid for solute transport in systems with impermeable boundaries after the initial mixing period in which the solute is fully mixed with the inlet fluid the model assumes that the solute is fully dissolved and therefore has the same average velocity as the fluid 66 the advective dispersive transport model with retardation and decay quantifies the hydrodynamic dispersion of a single soluble species which undergoes both decay and retardation it is assumed that the porous media is homogeneous isotropic and that the medium is saturated the flow is steady state and darcy s law applies 67 darcy s law is a model for fluid flow through porous media which states that s linear momentum is conserved and that there is a directly proportional relationship between inlet flow rate fluid viscosity and pressure drop over a given distance 68 this partial differential equation can be used to describe the movement of a chemical tracer in subsurface media and is given in eq 16 μ and γ are the first order decay coefficient and zero order production constant respectively and can be used for non conservative reactive chemical tracers 69 r a chemical retardation factor is included in the transport equation and is provided in eq 17 this retardation factor includes a distribution coefficient kd which indicates the ratio of solute concentration in the solid and the liquid 70 a kd value close to 0 is considered non sorbing and an increase in the kd value indicates a larger sorbing tendency the value depends on the physical characteristics of the tracer and in some cases the sub surface media d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient and is a measure of describing the mixing of solutes in porous media 71 16 r c t d 2 c x 2 u c t μ c γ 17 r 1 ρ b k d ε the advective dispersive transport equation is based on assumptions of saturated flow and porous media this means that the use of this equation is limited to systems with sub surface media and saturated flow which in the case of cws is most commonly hf cws however the size of the cw is not a limiting factor for this model it has been used on both large scale cws and pilot scale cws 72 74 one study used an analytically solved form of the advective dispersive transport equation developed by ogata banks 1961 75 to determine changing hydraulic parameters due to biological growth of two hf cws with different filter mediums 72 the study found that biological growth decreased the drainable porosity but had a negligible effect on hydraulic conductivity and that selecting a coarse filter medium could mitigate clogging caused by biological growth 72 another study used the advection dispersion transport equation for simulation based design of a cw to determine the optimal size under specific conditions 12 from the simulation the researchers determined that quantifying ambient temperature effluent release and recycle streams were more important than precipitation and evaporation when determining the optimum size of a cw a third study used a two dimensional depth averaged hydrodynamic mode combined with the advective dispersive transport model on an hf cw to account for the effect of vegetation on the hydrodynamics in cws 73 the model in this study was able to predict the bimodality of the rtd response when this hydraulic behaviour was due to two different flow channels the main flow channel and vegetated zones moutsopoulos et al 2011 used the advective dispersive transport equation to simulate the hydraulic performance and nitrogen transformation of hf cw 74 from this model the researchers were able to simulate nitrogen transport and decay accurately in unplanted systems but found that the extra complexity introduced by vegetation in a planted system either because of the root zone or uptake of ammonia by the roots proved to be less accurate and required further investigation 3 4 richard s equation richard s equation is a partial differential equation which is used to describe unsaturated flow in a non porous medium and is defined according to eq 18 30 the relationship between pressure head h hydraulic conductivity k and water content θ are described according to van genuchten mualem functions eq 19 and eq 20 76 this equation is commonly used to describe the water flow in vf cws as they are often intermittently loaded and therefore the flow is variable saturated and dynamic 77 richard s equation forms one of the partial differential equations in the hydrus wetland model executed in hydrus software which is one of the most detailed process based models currently available 77 many researchers have made use of this model to successfully validate and investigate the processes taking place in cws 78 79 18 θ t z k h z 1 19 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α h 1 1 m m h 0 θ θ s h 0 20 k k s θ θ r θ s θ r 0 5 1 1 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 m m 2 h 0 k k s h 0 3 5 vart model variable residence time vart model was initially developed as a model for longitudinal dispersion and solute transport in streams 80 it is based on a double layer conceptual model the upper layer is dominated by advection transient storage and the lower layer is a diffusion dominated storage zone 80 the model is used for fws cws because they have the same double layer that is conceptualised for the vart model additionally streams and fws cws have similar transient storage zones 81 the vart model has been used to compute the hydraulic residence time of cws filled with two different mediums and was able to accurately predict the rtd for design purposes 11 the model was combined with kinetic processes to simulate the removal of total phosphorus and ammonium 82 and bod 83 in fws cws and it was found that there was a good simulation of the three contaminants and the combined model is considered an efficient tool for designing cws and understanding the effects of various processes and mechanisms on the treatment of wastewater in cws 82 83 3 6 convolution integral the convolution integral can be used to describe the flow behaviour of a system this model is not based on physical flow processes but rather the experimental data obtained directly from tracer studies for this reason the convolution integral can be used to describe the flow behaviour of fws hf and vf cws sheridan et al 2014 used the convolution integral to determine the rate constants for the degradation of ethanol and a lumped parameter cod in winery effluent within an hf cw 84 these researchers found that because the rate constants obtained from the convolution integral are based directly on the rtd data they were more accurate than the rate constants determine using the other models investigated it is also possible to determine the conversion of a reactor regardless of the degree of non ideal behaviour directly from the tracer information for first order reactions the convolution integral derived by levenspiel 1999 is given in eq 21 57 21 c o u t t 0 t c i n t t e t d t it can be shown that eq 22 is an equivalent form of eq 21 22 c o u t t 0 t c i n t e t t d t the concise form is given in eq 23 23 c o u t t c i n e the usefulness of this method arises from the fact that no reactor model is assumed rather the unique data arising from the tracer test are directly utilised this also means that the convolution integral can be used for cws of any size this method was found to be significantly more accurate at modelling the reactor processes than the pfr or tanks in series models 4 discussion all the methods discussed in this paper have their advantages and disadvantages some are simple to use but do not provide detailed information about the interaction of hydraulic processes and biokinetic processes while others allow the researcher to investigate these interactions but at a high computational cost the choice of hydraulic depends on the need of the researcher fig 3 is a tool that researchers can use to aid the decision of which model to use if the researcher is looking to investigate the effect of changing design parameters of a cw on the mixing and the volume utilisation of a system then the method of moments or tanks in series model would be good choices if modelling the degradation of contaminants in wastewater and understanding the effect of hydraulic conditions on this degradation is the focus researchers could choose from the advective dispersive transport model vart model or richards equation as these are all typically combined with biokinetic models the type of cw being investigated will also influence the model used if the flow is unsaturated as is typical of a vf cw then richard s equation should be the hydraulic model of choice if the system being investigated is a fws cw then vart is the most appropriate of the models method of moments tanks in series model and the convolution integral can be used for all types of cws as they make no assumptions of the physical flow processes the vart model richard s equation and the advective dispersive transport equation do not require a tracer test although a tracer test to validate the results from these models is recommended this means that these models can be effective for design purposes before the system has been built 5 conclusion the modelling of cws had advanced a great deal in the last two decades and while there has been a larger focus of the biokinetic models the use of an effective hydraulic model is necessary for furthering research design and use of these systems cws are an effective form of wastewater treatment owing to the multiple processes taking place in parallel but this also makes them complex systems to model the modelling technique chosen is dependent on the aim of the researcher whether it is for understanding the effects of changing design parameters on hydraulic conditions and contaminant removal or if it is for research purposes and investigating the relationships between multiple processes one cannot avoid making use of a hydraulic model for either of these aims the effectiveness of a cw in treating wastewater is dependent on the time the water spends in the system and this time is dependent on the hydraulic behaviour of the cw it is for this vital reason that understanding and quantifying the hydraulic behaviour of cws be achieved with the use of accurate models declaration of competing interest the authors of review of experimental procedures and modelling techniques for flow behaviour and their

chloride ions on the quaternary ammonium moiety of q sg chloride concentration in the effluent increased to 79 mg l at 20 min and then decreased slowly thereafter phosphate was detected in the effluent at 455 min and its concentration increased gradually while nitrate and sulfate were not detected anions appeared in the effluent earlier when using an influent solution of nitrate 60 mg l phosphate 60 mg l and sulfate 60 mg l ex 1 than in the case of ex 4 due to the increased influent anion concentrations chloride concentration in the effluent increased rapidly to 145 mg l at 28 min

ex 4 8 13 and 15 where nitrate influent concentration remained at 20 mg l while phosphate and sulfate concentrations in the influent varied nitrate did not appear in the effluent until 490 min in the ternary solution of nitrate 20 mg l phosphate 20 mg l and sulfate 20 mg l ex 4 when either sulfate ex 13 or phosphate ex 15 concentration increased to 100 mg l nitrate detection time was shortened to either 315 or 217 min respectively when both sulfate and phosphate concentrations increased to 100 mg l ex 8 nitrate detection time was shortened to 245 min nitrate influent concentration remained at 100 mg l in ex 3 6 11 and 12 while phosphate and sulfate concentrations varied in the influent nitrate was not detected in the effluent until 253 min in the ternary solution of nitrate 100 mg l phosphate 20 mg l and sulfate 20 mg l ex 3 when either phosphate ex 11 or sulfate ex 12 concentration increased to 100 mg l nitrate detection time was reduced to either 175 or 161 min respectively when both phosphate and sulfate concentrations increased to 100 mg l ex 6 nitrate detection time was reduced to 105 min our results demonstrated the dynamic and competitive breakthrough behaviors of competing anions during their adsorption and leaching in flow through columns packed with q sg the breakthrough curves of nitrate in pristine q sg and regenerated q sg are presented in fig s5 in pristine q sg nitrate detection time was 140 min whereas nitrate detection time in first regenerated q sg was reduced to 115 min then as the regeneration was conducted further two more times nitrate detection time and breakthrough behaviors maintained the regeneration tests confirmed that q sg could be regenerated and reused for nitrate removal with nacl solution 3 2 2 separation factors of

backpropagation and is the most widely used method in the ann architecture 19 in the last decade researchers have used the ann model to predict and optimize aqueous contaminant removal in the batch

change in the influent solution conditions when the influent solution containing ternary anions of nitrate 20 mg l phosphate 20 mg l and sulfate 20 mg l was injected into the column ex 4 chloride

ex 4 8 13 and 15 where nitrate influent concentration remained at 20 mg l while phosphate and sulfate concentrations in the influent varied nitrate did not appear in the effluent until 490 min in the ternary solution of nitrate 20 mg l phosphate 20 mg l and sulfate 20 mg l ex 4 when either sulfate ex 13 or phosphate ex 15 concentration increased to 100 mg l nitrate detection time was shortened to either 315 or 217 min respectively when both sulfate and phosphate concentrations increased to 100 mg l ex 8 nitrate detection time was shortened to 245 min nitrate influent concentration remained at 100 mg l in ex 3 6 11 and 12 while phosphate and sulfate concentrations varied in the influent nitrate was not detected in the effluent until 253 min in the ternary solution of nitrate 100 mg l phosphate 20 mg l and sulfate 20 mg l ex 3 when either phosphate ex 11 or sulfate ex 12 concentration increased to 100 mg l nitrate detection time was reduced to either 175 or 161 min respectively when both phosphate and sulfate concentrations increased to 100 mg l ex 6 nitrate detection time was reduced to 105 min our results demonstrated the dynamic and competitive breakthrough behaviors of competing anions during their adsorption and leaching in flow through columns packed with q sg the breakthrough curves of nitrate in pristine q sg and regenerated q sg are presented in fig s5 in pristine q sg nitrate detection time was 140 min whereas nitrate detection time in first regenerated q sg was reduced to 115 min then as the regeneration was conducted further two more times nitrate detection time and breakthrough behaviors maintained the regeneration tests confirmed that q sg could be regenerated and reused for nitrate removal with nacl solution 3 2 2 separation factors of competing anions based on the column experimental data the separation factors α of anions were quantified using eq s7 in table 3 the nitrate to phosphate separation factors α p n calculated from the nitrate and sulfate breakthrough curves were in the range of 1 06 and infinity the values α p n indicated the selective removal of nitrate over phosphate in the ternary solution conditions the lowest value of α p n was determined in ex 12 with the ternary solution of nitrate 100 mg l phosphate 20 mg l and sulfate 100 mg l the highest value of α p n was obtained with the ternary solution of nitrate

modifying and adjusting weight w and bias b values after training the validating subset was used to avoid overfitting of the ann model by calculating mse between the predicted and observed values of the validating subset in this step the values of w and b which were set for the lowest mse were chosen as the optimized values for the ann model after optimizing the ann model the testing subset was used to compare the predicted values with the observed values to assess the performance of the developed ann model 17 57 the ann model performance is directly influenced by the structure of the ann

13569,in industry various fluorescent tracers were added to the circulating cooling water systems for online monitoring of water treatment agents ptsa 1 3 6 8 pyrenetetrasulfonic acid sodium salt as a pyrene sulfonate was widely used but there was no effective way to treat it in the discharging process in this article a uv based advanced oxidation process uv based aops was used to degrade ptsa in wastewater the results were for kinetics the effects of initial concentration of ptsa h2o2 concentration intermediate products and interference factors ph and inorganic anions were investigated for efficiency the removal of ptsa and toc reached 97 and 35 and the fluorescence of the solution disappeared within 60 min for pathways by analyzing the charge population and surface electrostatic potential of ptsa molecule the possible attack site of hydroxyl radical was speculated and the possible intermediate product was 1 4 5 8 naphthalenetracarboxylic acid and verified by nmr and hplc ms the cytotoxicity of ptsa and its hydroxylated products were compared to determine the toxicity of ptsa hydroxylation products in degradation process keywords pyrene sulfonate uv h2o2 aops hydroxyl radical 1 introduction in the industrial circulating cooling water systems various water treatment agents are widely used to prolong the service life of circulating water for the water treatment agents it s necessary to maintain a certain concentration in the equipment to work effectively therefore fluorescent tracers are added into the circulating cooling water by enterprises to indirectly monitor the water treatment agents through measuring the fluorescence intensity of the aqueous solution 1 in particular nalco corporation which provides water treatment and processes chemicals for clean water promotes 1 3 6 8 pyrenetetrasulfonic acid ptsa based fluorescent tracer which is a derivative of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 2 because of the π π conjugation effect of pyrene ring ptsa has strong fluorescence while sulfonic group make it soluble in water however after the circulating cooling water has been concentrated for 4 6 times the effects of water treatment agents begin to decrease and enterprises need to discharge this part of concentrated water and add new parts after the discharged wastewater is partly recovered by membrane most of the them are directly discharged to the wastewater treatment plant wwtp but it s difficult for conventional bio methods to treat pahs and its derivatives effectively 3 s sun et al investigated the treatment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and its derivatives in wastewater from harbin wwtp china the results showed that 20 of pahs were adsorbed by sludge 65 were volatilized into the air or biodegraded and 15 were not effectively treated 4 the residual in water has certain toxicity especially photo enhanced toxicity to aquatic organisms like fish 5 moreover it will gradually accumulate in the human body with the function of biological chain m c buell et al investigated the pollution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and its derivatives in the sediments of irving bay inner harbor around the northeast of lake huron one of the five great lakes detected 46 mg pahs per kilogram of sediment and analyzed its impact on local ecology 6 x li et al used the strains extracted from oily sludge to investigate the degradation ability of pyrene and the degradation efficiency of pyrene with initial concentration of 50 mg l was about 33 in 30 days 7 lots of conclusions define that the removal of pahs by biological methods alone is ineffective rather traditional physicochemical methods has broad application prospects for the treatment of refractory organic pollutants and toxic organic pollutants advanced oxidation process aops has high treatment efficiency aops and its combined application with other processes are the research hotspots in wastewater treatment recently 8 9 aops is a method to degrade organic compounds by producing hydroxyl radicals o h e 2 80 v hydroxyl radicals degrade pollutants through dehydrogenation electrophilic addition and electron transfer 10 13 for the degradation of fluorescent tracer in circulating cooling water considering the better transparency of wastewater a uv based advanced oxidation process uv based aops is used to treat ptsa with the activation of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 e 1 78 v which is efficient green and without secondary pollution 14 due to the non selectivity of hydroxyl radical for pollutants it s necessary to consider the competition of intermediate products in the degradation process of refractory organic pollutants 15 when the initial concentration of ptsa is higher the relative amounts of intermediates is lower therefore it s necessary to modify the apparent kinetics constants of ptsa degradation process with the ptsa initial concentration and the intermediates concentration at the same time the main contents of this paper are to 1 investigate the degradation kinetics of ptsa 2 speculate the degradation pathways and intermediate products of ptsa through theoretical analysis and experiments 3 investigate the toc and fluorescence removal of ptsa 4 compare the cytotoxicity of ptsa and its hydroxylated products 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ptsa purity 98 were purchased from kunshan haite plastic pigment co ltd china sodium chloride sodium sulfate sodium nitrate nacl na2so4 nano3 ar and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 wt were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china cell counting kit 8 cck 8 was purchased from dojindo co ltd japan deuteroxide reagent d2o 99 9 atom d was obtained from qingdao tenglong weibo technology co ltd china methanol hplc grade was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china 2 2 experimental procedure for ptsa degradation the degradation experiments were carried out in uv disinfection equipment purchased from shenzhen ruixing water treatment equipment co ltd china the volume of the equipment was 500 ml and when 250 ml of solution was added as can be seen in fig 1 and fig s1 the 10 w ultraviolet mercury lamp wavelength 253 7 nm located at the equipment center radiates the ultraviolet light evenly throughout the solution before the experiment a certain concentration of ptsa and related reagents were mixed evenly and then added to the equipment during the experiment a water pump was used to continuously circulate the solution in the equipment and 4 5 ml solution was taken out every 10 20 min for determination the time depended on the speed of the reaction the concentration of ptsa was measured by a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2450 shimadzu japan 2 3 degradation kinetics of ptsa for refractory organic pollutants the competition of intermediate products in the degradation process could not be ignored therefore the effect of intermediates was considered when computing the apparent kinetic constants of ptsa degradation process by investigating the photodegradation kinetics of different initial concentrations of ptsa 10 20 30 40 mg l determined according to the actual water sample fig s2 and table s1 further confirmation was ensured by adding h2o2 to improve the concentration of hydroxyl radicals due to the electron transfer reaction between anions and hydroxyl radicals at a certain ph it was necessary to investigate the effect of anions on the degradation of hydroxyl radicals 16 18 the specific values were decided by the quality of circulating cooling water ph value between 5 and 9 the concentrations of chloride ions and sulfate ions were about 250 mg l nitrate ions were about 20 mg l the quality condition of circulating cooling water was obtained from shandong taihe water treatment technology co ltd china through the actual sampling 2 4 degradation pathways of ptsa the degradation pathways and intermediates of ptsa were deduced by theoretical analysis and experiments for the degradation of ptsa the theoretical analysis was as follows due to the hydroxyl radical o h generated in the photochemical reaction process was electron deficient free radical with strong electrophilic properties it was easier to attack those atoms with high electron cloud density therefore the atom with more negative charge and lower electrostatic potential in the target molecule might be the attack site of hydroxyl radical with the reaction of electrophilic addition dehydrogenation and electron transfer so the degradation pathways could be deduced these intermediates were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance nmr 19 20 and high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hplc ms the specific operation steps were shown in supplementary data 2 5 degradation efficiency of ptsa toc removal 21 22 and fluorescence removal 23 26 were used to evaluate the degradation efficiency of ptsa the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs derivative the toc removal of ptsa 20 mg l under different conditions was measured by a toc analyzer toc l cph shimadzu japan the fluorescence removal under different conditions was measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4600 hitachi japan 2 6 comparison of cytotoxicity the hydroxylation products of pahs usually had stronger biological toxicity 27 28 the cytotoxicity of ptsa and one of its hydroxylation products hpts 8 hydroxy 1 3 6 pyrene trisulfonic acid sodium salt monohydroxy substituents of ptsa with different concentrations were tested with mice hepatocytes the initial concentrations were 0 0 02 0 2 2 and 20 mg l and the cells were cultured at 37 and 5 co2 condition for 24 h the toxicity evaluation index was cell viability which was detected by cck 8 reagent 29 31 cell viability was the percentage of living cells in the total cells the concentration of methylene products produced by living cells and cck 8 reagents was directly proportional to the number of living cells the optical density od of each groups methylene products at 450 nm wavelength was determined by an enzyme labeling instrument infinite 200 pro tecan switzerland and when the cell viability of the blank group was defined as 100 then the cell viability of the remaining groups could be calculated as eq 1 32 33 1 cell viability e xperimental group control group blank group control group where the experimental group stands for cell solutions treated with different concentrations of initial materials control group stands for cell free medium solutions treated with different concentrations of initial materials and blank group stands for cell solution without initial materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ptsa initial concentration and h2o2 concentration the effect of initial ptsa concentration on degradation was shown in fig 2 a and d the degradation data fitted pseudo first order kinetic model and the calculation and comparison were shown in table s2 when the initial concentrations of ptsa were 10 20 30 and 40 mg l and the degradation efficiency of ptsa were 73 6 51 7 38 4 and 31 2 in 2 h through the reaction of ptsa with hydrogen peroxide solution of gradient concentration the optimum concentration range of hydrogen peroxide was between 1 and 5 mg l ptsa 20 mg l solution was used as substrate to investigate the effect of different h2o2 concentration and the results were shown in fig 2 b e and table s3 when the concentration of h2o2 reached 3 mg l the degradation efficiency of ptsa reached 97 after that with the increased of hydrogen peroxide concentration the improving of ptsa removal rate slowed down in order to observe the obvious inhibition and promotion effect in the later experiments the optimal concentration of hydrogen peroxide was set as 3 mg l degradation of ptsa with different initial concentrations in uv h2o2 process were shown in the fig 2 c f and table s4 for the elementary reaction of ptsa degradation the apparent kinetics constants kobs would not change with the initial concentration but in the actual process kobs value changed with the ptsa initial concentration as shown in fig 3 this cleared that the ptsa degradation process cannot be replaced by simple elementary reaction the competition caused by intermediates with hydroxyl radical could not be ignored here if hydroxyl radical was chosen as the research object then for its generation and consumption there were eqs 2 to 4 34 2 h2o2 hν 2 oh k1 3 oh ptsa co2 h2o by products k2 kptsa 4 oh intermediates co2 h2o by products k3 kints where k1 stands for hydroxyl radical formation constants k2 k3 stand for hydroxyl radical reaction constants with ptsa and intermediate respectively kptsa kints stand for ptsa and intermediates reaction constants with hydroxyl radical respectively while 5

concentration could be easily determined however the specific value of intermediates impact factors could not be well calculated due to the complexity of intermediates and the limitations of laboratory conditions 3 2 effect of ph and inorganic anions considering the quality of circulating cooling water the effects of ph and inorganic anions concentration on the degradation of ptsa were investigated the effect of these interference factors on the kinetic constants of ptsa degradation was shown in the fig 4 it could be found that when ph ph and chloride ions acted together and when ph and sulfate ions acted together the change of kinetics constants had no obvious trend however when there was a certain concentration of nitrate ions in the solution and the ph of the solution increased from 5 to 9 it could be found that the degradation kinetics constants of ptsa had a downward trend which might be since nitrate could promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals under acidic conditions in short it could be concluded that due to the more complex intermediate reaction the degradation kinetics constants of ptsa were lower through the investigation of ph and inorganic anions it could be found that the uv h2o2 based aops has a good application prospect in the actual process 3 3 degradation pathways and intermediate products in this article gaussian 09 35 software and density functional theory dft were used 36 37 keywords were set as follows b3lyp 6 311g em gd3bj opt freq pop nbo the geometry of ptsa was optimized and the fully optimized geometries and stable point coordinates of the molecule was obtained the fully optimized geometries were shown in fig s3 the charge population in the most stable configuration of the molecule was calculated by natural bond orbital nbo theory the values of the ten carbon atoms on the periphery of pyrene ring were shown in table 1 then the optimized configuration of ptsa in gaussian 09 was imported into multiwfn 3 7 software to obtain the surface electrostatic potential of ptsa molecule and the analysis results were presented in vmd software in fig 5 38 it could be seen from the table 1 that for ptsa the four carbon atoms numbered 1 3 6 and 8 linked to sulfonic group on the pyrene ring carry more negative charges and are more vulnerable to hydroxyl radical attack this was consistent with the existing theory sulfonic group was an electron withdrawing group so the density of electron cloud on the carbon atom connected with it was higher as can be seen in fig 6 the surface electrostatic potential of ptsa was also lower near the sulfonic group so it was easier to attract hydroxyl radicals therefore it could be concluded that the hydroxyl radical first broke the cs bond on the pyrene ring of ptsa through electrophilic substitution as arrow and form the hydroxylation product of pyrene sulfonate after that hydroxylated products were converted to pyrene quinone by oxidation and further oxidized into 1 4 5 8 naphthalenetracarboxylic acid eventually those intermediate products were mineralized into water and carbon dioxide the degradation pathways were shown in fig 6 the relevant experimental conditions were the initial concentration of ptsa was 20 mg l the h2o2 concentration was 3 mg l the ph value of the solution was 7 for verification the 1h nmr spectra of ptsa solution before and after degradation hydroxylation products hpts 8 hydroxy 1 3 6 pyrene trisulfonic acid sodium salt were shown in fig 7 for ptsa the chemical shift of hydrogen on pyrene ring increased due to the electron withdrawing effect of sulfonate group in the degraded solution signals with chemical shift between 8 9 appeared presumably because the sulfonic group on ptsa molecule was replaced by hydroxyl group chemical shift of hydrogen on pyrene ring was reduced due to the electron donating effect of hydroxyl group the hydroxylation product hpts initial solution was compared however the signal from the intermediate product 1 4 5 8 naphthalenetracarboxylic acid chemical shift δ 7 8 ppm was not found probably because it was more prone to react with hydroxyl radicals than ptsa chemical shift about 7 ppm was from the benzene ring the further degradation products the results of hplc ms were also used for the analysis and were shown in table s5 and fig s4 but the signal of the key position was not very prominent these were due to the non selectivity of hydroxyl radical 3 4 degradation efficiency of ptsa the toc removal of ptsa was shown in fig s5 when the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was 3 mg l and the uv fluence time was 1 h the toc removal of ptsa were respectively 35 45 much higher than the biological methods 33 in 30 days as a fluorescent tracer the fluorescence intensity of ptsa was also an index to evaluate its removal efficiency the 3d fluorescence spectra of ptsa solution before and after degradation were shown in fig 8 a to c it was obvious that the fluorescence of the solution disappeared with the aops treatment under uv 254 nm radiation something interesting happened the color of ptsa solution changed from purple to light cyan during degradation fig 8 d according to the emission spectrum at 254 nm before and after ptsa degradation in fig 8 e after degradation the fluorescence intensity of the solution at about 400 nm decreased a lot and the peak became flat human eyes were more sensitive to higher wavelength cyan light than purple light so the solution looked light cyan 3 5 comparison of cytotoxicity the cytotoxicity of ptsa and one of its hydroxyl substituted products hpts 8 hydroxy 1 3 6 pyrene trisulfonic acid sodium salt was shown in fig 9 ptsa had no obvious cytotoxicity so it was difficult to be oxidized and participate in cell metabolism however the hpts cytotoxicity o increased with the hpts concentration this was proved that the hydroxylation products of pahs had stronger toxicity therefore if the ptsa in the circulating cooling water wastewater was not treated effectively before discharge after it entered the natural water body and oxidated by sunlight and dissolved oxygen the decomposition products would bring great harm to the organisms 4 conclusion in this article uv h2o2 process was used to treat a fluorescent tracer ptsa in circulating cooling water when 3 mg l h2o2 was added the removal of ptsa was 97 and toc removal was 35 45 under ultraviolet light radiation for 1 h the fluorescence of the solution almost disappeared by adjusting the concentration of hydrogen peroxide it could be concluded that the apparent kinetics constants of ptsa were inversely proportional to the initial concentration which was caused by the competition of intermediate products meanwhile the effects of some interference factors ph inorganic anions in the circulating cooling water on the degradation process of ptsa were also investigated and the results showed that there was no effective interference on the ptsa degradation the degradation pathways and possible intermediates of ptsa 1 4 5 8 naphthalenetracarboxylic acid were speculated with theoretical analysis and experimental verification through cytotoxicity experiment the toxicity of ptsa hydroxylation products was stronger than itself so it effectively illustrated the necessity of ptsa treatment author statement shaokang cai

13569,in industry various fluorescent tracers were added to the circulating cooling water systems for online monitoring of water treatment agents ptsa 1 3 6 8 pyrenetetrasulfonic acid sodium salt as a pyrene sulfonate was widely used but there was no effective way to treat it in the discharging process in this article a uv based advanced oxidation process uv based aops was used to degrade ptsa in wastewater the results were for kinetics the effects of initial concentration of ptsa h2o2 concentration intermediate products and interference factors ph and inorganic anions were investigated for efficiency the removal of ptsa and toc reached 97 and 35 and the fluorescence of the solution disappeared within 60 min for pathways by analyzing the charge population and surface electrostatic potential of ptsa molecule the possible attack site of hydroxyl radical was speculated and the possible intermediate product was 1 4 5 8 naphthalenetracarboxylic acid and verified by nmr and hplc ms the cytotoxicity of ptsa and its hydroxylated products were compared to determine the toxicity of ptsa hydroxylation products in degradation process keywords pyrene sulfonate uv h2o2 aops hydroxyl radical 1 introduction in the industrial circulating cooling water systems various water treatment agents are widely used to prolong the service life of circulating water for the water treatment agents it s necessary to maintain a certain concentration in the equipment to work effectively therefore fluorescent tracers are added into the circulating cooling water by enterprises to indirectly monitor the water treatment agents through measuring the fluorescence intensity of the aqueous solution 1 in particular nalco corporation which provides water treatment and processes chemicals for clean water promotes 1 3 6 8 pyrenetetrasulfonic acid ptsa based fluorescent tracer which is a derivative of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 2 because of the π π conjugation effect of pyrene ring ptsa has strong fluorescence while sulfonic group make it soluble in water however after the circulating cooling water has been concentrated for 4 6 times the effects of water treatment agents begin to decrease and enterprises need to discharge this part of concentrated water and add new parts after the discharged wastewater is partly recovered by membrane most of the them are directly discharged to the wastewater treatment plant wwtp but it s difficult for conventional bio methods to treat pahs and its derivatives effectively 3 s sun et al investigated the treatment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and its derivatives in wastewater from harbin wwtp china the results showed that 20 of pahs were adsorbed by sludge 65 were volatilized into the air or biodegraded and 15 were not effectively treated 4 the residual in water has certain toxicity especially photo enhanced toxicity to aquatic organisms like fish 5 moreover it will gradually accumulate in the human body with the function of biological chain m c buell et al investigated the pollution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and its derivatives in the sediments of irving bay inner harbor around the northeast of lake huron one of the five great lakes detected 46 mg pahs per kilogram of sediment and analyzed its impact on local ecology 6 x li et al used the strains extracted from oily sludge to investigate the degradation ability of pyrene and the degradation efficiency of pyrene with initial concentration of 50 mg l was about 33 in 30 days 7 lots of conclusions define that the removal of pahs by biological methods alone is ineffective rather traditional physicochemical methods has broad application prospects for the treatment of refractory organic pollutants and toxic organic pollutants advanced oxidation process aops has high treatment efficiency aops and its combined application with other processes are the research hotspots in wastewater treatment recently 8 9 aops is a method to degrade organic compounds by producing hydroxyl radicals o h e 2 80 v hydroxyl radicals degrade pollutants through dehydrogenation electrophilic addition and electron transfer 10 13 for the degradation of fluorescent tracer in circulating cooling water considering the better transparency of wastewater a uv based advanced oxidation process uv based aops is used to treat ptsa with the activation of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 e 1 78 v which is efficient green and without secondary pollution 14 due to the non selectivity of hydroxyl radical for pollutants it s necessary to consider the competition of intermediate products in the degradation process of refractory organic pollutants 15 when the initial concentration of ptsa is higher the relative amounts of intermediates is lower therefore it s necessary to modify the apparent kinetics constants of ptsa degradation process with the ptsa initial concentration and the intermediates concentration at the same time the main contents of this paper are to 1 investigate the degradation kinetics of ptsa 2 speculate the degradation pathways and intermediate products of ptsa through theoretical analysis and experiments 3 investigate the toc and fluorescence removal of ptsa 4 compare the cytotoxicity of ptsa and its hydroxylated products 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ptsa purity 98 were purchased from kunshan haite plastic pigment co ltd china sodium chloride sodium sulfate sodium nitrate nacl na2so4 nano3 ar and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 wt were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china cell counting kit 8 cck 8 was purchased from dojindo co ltd japan deuteroxide reagent d2o 99 9 atom d was obtained from qingdao tenglong weibo technology co ltd china methanol hplc grade was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china 2 2 experimental procedure for ptsa degradation the degradation experiments were carried out in uv disinfection equipment purchased from shenzhen ruixing water treatment equipment co ltd china the volume of the equipment was 500 ml and when 250 ml of solution was added as can be seen in fig 1 and fig s1 the 10 w ultraviolet mercury lamp wavelength 253 7 nm located at the equipment center radiates the ultraviolet light evenly throughout the solution before the experiment a certain concentration of ptsa and related reagents were mixed evenly and then added to the equipment during the experiment a water pump was used to continuously circulate the solution in the equipment and 4 5 ml solution was taken out every 10 20 min for determination the time depended on the speed of the reaction the concentration of ptsa was measured by a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2450 shimadzu japan 2 3 degradation kinetics of ptsa for refractory organic pollutants the competition of intermediate products in the degradation process could not be ignored therefore the effect of intermediates was considered when computing the apparent kinetic constants of ptsa degradation process by investigating the photodegradation kinetics of different initial concentrations of ptsa 10 20 30 40 mg l determined according to the actual water sample fig s2 and table s1 further confirmation was ensured by adding h2o2 to improve the concentration of hydroxyl radicals due to the electron transfer reaction between anions and hydroxyl radicals at a certain ph it was necessary to investigate the effect of anions on the degradation of hydroxyl radicals 16 18 the specific values were decided by the quality of circulating cooling water ph value between 5 and 9 the concentrations of chloride ions and sulfate ions were about 250 mg l nitrate ions were about 20 mg l the quality condition of circulating cooling water was obtained from shandong taihe water treatment technology co ltd china through the actual sampling 2 4 degradation pathways of ptsa the degradation pathways and intermediates of ptsa were deduced by theoretical analysis and experiments for the degradation of ptsa the theoretical analysis was as follows due to the hydroxyl radical o h generated in the photochemical reaction process was electron deficient free radical with strong electrophilic properties it was easier to attack those atoms with high electron cloud density therefore the atom with more negative charge and lower electrostatic potential in the target molecule might be the attack site of hydroxyl radical with the reaction of electrophilic addition dehydrogenation and electron transfer so the degradation pathways could be deduced these intermediates were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance nmr 19 20 and high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hplc ms the specific operation steps were shown in supplementary data 2 5 degradation efficiency of ptsa toc removal 21 22 and fluorescence removal 23 26 were used to evaluate the degradation efficiency of ptsa the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs derivative the toc removal of ptsa 20 mg l under different conditions was measured by a toc analyzer toc l cph shimadzu japan the fluorescence removal under different conditions was measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4600 hitachi japan 2 6 comparison of cytotoxicity the hydroxylation products of pahs usually had stronger biological toxicity 27 28 the cytotoxicity of ptsa and one of its hydroxylation products hpts 8 hydroxy 1 3 6 pyrene trisulfonic acid sodium salt monohydroxy substituents of ptsa with different concentrations were tested with mice hepatocytes the initial concentrations were 0 0 02 0 2 2 and 20 mg l and the cells were cultured at 37 and 5 co2 condition for 24 h the toxicity evaluation index was cell viability which was detected by cck 8 reagent 29 31 cell viability was the percentage of living cells in the total cells the concentration of methylene products produced by living cells and cck 8 reagents was directly proportional to the number of living cells the optical density od of each groups methylene products at 450 nm wavelength was determined by an enzyme labeling instrument infinite 200 pro tecan switzerland and when the cell viability of the blank group was defined as 100 then the cell viability of the remaining groups could be calculated as eq 1 32 33 1 cell viability e xperimental group control group blank group control group where the experimental group stands for cell solutions treated with different concentrations of initial materials control group stands for cell free medium solutions treated with different concentrations of initial materials and blank group stands for cell solution without initial materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ptsa initial concentration and h2o2 concentration the effect of initial ptsa concentration on degradation was
