13200,to further improve the performance of sludge dewatering this study used the uv light initiated aqueous micellar polymerization method to obtain hydrophobic associating cationic polyacrylamide hacpam as a flocculant and coupled it with quartz sand and fly ash to investigate sludge flocculation and dewatering the results show that the flocculation of hacpam is interfered with by the framework material quartz sand and fly ash which leads to significant changes in the sludge floc particle size capillary suction time cst settlement performance and other indicators this is the result of the coupling between hacpam and the framework materials the larger the molecular weight of hacpam the larger the particle size of the sludge flocs is and the better the dehydration performance the dosage of 7 5784 kg ton t dry solids ds is the optimum dosage level when the sludge dewatering performance is the best it is represented by the largest sludge floc size 2280 Î¼m the highest removal free water content 90 9 and the inflection point of cst change 59 3 s when hacpam is coupled with quartz sand and fly ash flocculated sludge different characteristics of dewatering performance are showed both low dose hacpam 3 coupled with fly ash and high dose hacpam 3 coupled with quartz sand can achieve better dehydration effects but the former has more advantages than the latter the 3d scanning structure explains why hacpam 3 is more suitable for coupling fly ash to improve the dewatering performance of sludge in addition the mechanism is also discussed graphical abstract unlabelled

a direct product of sewage treatment sludge dewatering is the core difficulty of sludge treatment and runs through the whole process of sludge treatment however the sludge dewatering process generally has poor dewatering performance and low dewatering efficiency and the reason is closely related to the characteristics of the sludge 1 sludge has a high content of organic matter small particles and a floc structure sludge has a large surface area and a high degree of hydrophilicity sludge makes it difficult to separate the surface adsorbed water and chemically bound water by capillary forces from the sludge flocs through mechanical dehydration 2 3 the surface of the sludge flocs is negatively charged causing them to repel each other which makes the floc structure dispersed and stable generally cationic flocculants such as cationic polyacrylamide cpam are used to condition sludge so that sludge flocs and flocculants are electrically neutralized thereby accelerating the dewatering process of sludge and improving dewatering efficiency 4 5 however the cationic flocculant pam contains many amide groups which are hydrophilic substances pam cannot cause the surface adsorbed water attached to the sludge flocs to break away into free water and be separated and removed instead it will be bound by the hydrophilic amide group and wrapped in the floc structure making it difficult to separate and remove the adsorbed water on the surface 6 7 to improve the functional limitations of cpam in the process of sludge dewatering we propose grafting hydrophobic groups into the structure of cationic hydrophilic pam groups to reduce the combination of sludge flocs and surface adsorbed water through the hydrophobic repulsion of hydrophobic groups this process drives away the surface and internal moisture attached to the sludge floc structure promotes the conversion of the adsorbed water and bound water in the sludge floc to the form of free water and interstitial water and increases the proportion of free water and interstitial water therefore the goal of improving the efficiency of sludge dewatering was achieved theoretically in addition to the adsorption bridging and electrical neutralization of cpam 2 8 the flocculation mechanism of hacpam also has a hydrophobic association bridging effect enhanced by the introduction of hydrophobic groups the three functions work together which can greatly strengthen the flocculation performance of hacpam many studies have reported on the synthetic materials and methods of hydrophobic cationic polyacrylamide which have been shown to be very stable and mature 9 12 in recent years the synthesis process of polymerization initiated by ultraviolet light 11 13 14 or ultrasonic waves 4 15 16 has been reported the method introduces ultraviolet light or ultrasonic waves based on aqueous micellar copolymerization reduces activation energy initiates a polymerization reaction at room temperature can shorten the reaction time has energy saving effect and is easy to control zheng huaili et al 11 used acrylamide am acryloxyethyl trimethylammonium chloride dac butyl acrylate ba and 2 2 azobis 2 methylpropane amide dihydrochloride v 50 as a photoinitiator to synthesize p am dac ba lee khai ern et al 17 introduced the hydrophobic cationic monomer 3 acrylamido 2 hydroxypropyltrialkylammonium chloride ahptaac into the acrylamide chain to form a hydrophobically modified cationic polyacrylamide the copolymer characteristics can be adjusted by changing the molar ratio of the hydrophobic cationic monomer 1 6 mol li peizhi et al 18 newly synthesized hydrophobically associating cationic fluorinated polypropylene modified by fluorinated acrylate and 2 perfluorooctyl ethyl acrylate fea through free radical micellar copolymerization in aqueous solution zhong lianyang et al 19 used am dmdaac and ba to carry out free radical micellar copolymerization in an aqueous solution to synthesize hacpam and applied it to the experimental study of oily wastewater treatment the oil removal rate reached 93 4 at a dose of 50 mg l studies have shown that the cationic monomer species mainly choose acryloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride 11 20 and diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride dadmac 10 21 methacryloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dmc 22 and 2 methacryloyloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dmmc 23 among which the application of dac is most widely used most of the hydrophobic monomers are alkyl substituted acrylamide acrylate and its derivatives such as butyl acrylate these studies have provided a good preliminary basis for the synthesis of hacpam there have also been some reports on the application of hydrophobically associating cationic flocculants to sludge dewatering to improve sludge dewatering performance hu pan et al 24 designed and synthesized a series of hydrophobically associated cationic starch based flocculants cs dmrs which showed excellent sludge dewatering performance zheng huaili et al 11 synthesized p am dac ba to reduce the moisture content of the dehydrated cake to 73 2 feng xin et al 25 used the hydrophobic associating cationic polyacrylamide flocculant obtained by ultraviolet light to reduce the capillary water absorption time of sludge by 42 00 compared with cpam and to increase the free water content by 28 24 compared with cpam treatment the dehydration performance was significantly improved however the efficiency of sludge dewatering is also closely related to the method of dewatering commonly used dehydration methods include gravity concentration 26 centrifugal mechanical dehydration 27 vacuum filtration dehydration 28 belt filter press dehydration 29 plate and frame filter press dehydration 30 and thermal drying dehydration 31 gravity sedimentation is only suitable for sludge thickening and the purpose is to release more free water which is the predehydration stage mechanical dehydration is a way to directly produce dehydrated cake after gravity sedimentation the purpose is to use an external force to remove free water which is an intermediate stage of dehydration thermal drying dehydration is a method after mechanical dehydration the desiccated cake is dried to sludge powder to remove the bound water which belongs to the postdehydration stage the dehydration efficiencies of centrifugal mechanical dehydration vacuum filtration dehydration and belt filter press are not high the moisture content of the sludge cake after dewatering is approximately 80 85 plate and frame filter press dehydration can reduce the moisture content of the sludge cake to 55 65 and thermal drying dehydration can further dry the sludge cake with a moisture content of 55 85 to 20 40 the mechanical dewatering efficiency of sludge is usually not high the reason is that the floc structure of the sludge itself is soft and the organic matter in the sludge will be compressed and deformed under the action of external pressure so that the filtration and drainage channels of the water in the sludge cake are blocked and the greater the pressure is the more serious the blockage of the drainage channel which in turn leads to the low efficiency of filter press dehydration therefore a certain amount of inorganic inert and compressive strength materials such as fly ash quartz sand lime or gypsum are added in advance for conditioning to form a rigid grid skeleton support structure in the sludge which serves as the backbone of the structure the aim is to solve the problem of sludge compressibility however this kind of framework structure only has a rigid lattice structure and it is filled with highly compressed sludge flocs due to the high hydrophilicity of the sludge itself the water is restricted and difficult to discharge in past dehydration practice although pam has been applied on a large scale in the dehydration process of mechanical filter presses the compressibility and hydrophilicity of sludge flocs and the hydrophilicity of pam are intertwined during the filter press process and jointly produce a water retention effect on moisture therefore it can be imagined that if hacpam with a hydrophobic structure is innovatively coupled with fly ash or quartz sand to condition the sludge a mechanical filter press dehydration experiment is carried out it can not only exert the powerful flocculation function of organic polymer flocculant but also exert the framework support function of inert materials so that the two can establish a coupling framework structure in the sludge produce drainage channels and produce superior dehydration effects for these reasons this study used the uv light initiated aqueous micellar polymerization method to obtain hacpam with hydrophobic function promote the conversion of bound water in the sludge flocs to free water and couple it with the framework material to jointly condition the sludge to overcome the limitation of the floc s soft structure to discuss the change characteristics of the improvement of sludge dewatering performance search for a more suitable sludge dewatering method under this coupling effect and promote the further development of sludge dewatering research 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the test materials include hacpam synthetic raw materials and sludge dewatering test materials the synthetic raw

shown in fig 1 and the parameters and product properties of three synthetic copolymers hacpam 1 hacpam 2 and hacpam 3 are shown in table 3 the method of measuring copolymer properties refers to the method of feng et al 32 1 grafting ratio weight of grafted polymer weight of substrate 100 2 2 2 sewage sludge conditioning methods the sludge dewatering performance test is carried out in two steps the first step was to take 500 ml of the remaining sludge place it in a 1 l beaker add the hacpam copolymer solution according to a certain amount and stir for 3 min at a stirring speed of 80 rpm then 500 ml of the remaining sludge was placed in a 1 l beaker first quartz sand or fly ash aggregate was added at 3 8 kg t ds and stirred at 250 rpm for 5 min then the optimal amount of hacpam graft copolymer solution was added and stirred at 80 rpm for 3 min to condition the sludge sampling and analyzing the changes in sludge dewatering performance indicators each treatment was repeated 3 times 2 2 3 sludge dewatering performance test method 2 2 3 1 particle size analysis the particle size was measured by a malvern company ms3000 laser particle size analyzer during the measurement the stirring intensity of the solution was 500 rpm to prevent the particle flocs from being destroyed by vigorous stirring the particle size results are expressed as cut diameters dx10 dx50 and dx90 where dx90 means that 90 of the particle size is less than or equal to dx90 2 2 3 2 capillary suction time the capillary suction time cst of sludge is the time it takes for the sludge moisture to penetrate 2 cm on the specific absorbent filter paper according to the research report of feng xin et al 33 the cst test device was homemade as shown in fig 2 a sufficient amount of sludge sample approximately 5 ml was added to the carbon fiber tube during the measurement the time it took for the water to travel from 1 cm to 3 cm on whatman 17 grade chromatographic paper was recorded with a digital video camera since the fiber distribution of the chromatographic paper is directional the time it takes for moisture to travel in the x axis and y axis directions is different so the cst value of each sludge sample is calculated using the geometric average of cstx and csty 2 cst cst x cst y 2 2 3 3 settling velocity sv one hundred milliliters of conditioned sludge was placed in a 100 ml graduated

environment at 25 c to obtain an analysis sample the samples were scanned by computed tomography ct technology for a three dimensional structure and the changes in the internal pore structure were analyzed to discuss and analyze the influence of hacpam on the sludge dewatering performance according to the structure the ct scanning instrument was a nanovoxel3000d industrial ct system provided by

approximately 5 mm 1 3 mm 5 mm 6 porosity sum of pore volume s um of p ore volume sum of particle skeleton volume 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in the particle size of sludge flocs 3 1 1 the influence of hacpam dosage on the particle size of flocs the particle size of sludge flocs is an important reflection of sludge dewatering performance generally the larger the particle size is the better the dehydration performance he dongqin et al 1 found that the increase in sludge dewatering capacity is closely related to the increase in floc size it is more difficult to directly dehydrate the residual sludge the direct reason is that the particle size of the sludge flocs is extremely small usually 80 130 Î¼m a particle size that is too small absorbs more capillary adsorbed water and is difficult to remove by an external force therefore adding a flocculant to agglomerate sludge flocs and increase the particle size is an important method to improve the dewatering performance of sludge in this study the sludge particle size dx 90 used in the test is 133 Î¼m which is roughly the same as the sludge particle size studied in the past jun zhou et al 34 measured that the particle size of the original sludge was below 1000 Î¼m most of which were between 150 Î¼m and 500 Î¼m fig 3 shows that as the amount of commercially available cpam products increases the particle size of sludge flocs continues to increase when the dosage was increased to 3 7892 kg t ds 7 5784 kg t ds and 15 1569 kg t ds the sludge particle size dx 90 reached 1350 Î¼m 2110 Î¼m and 2480 Î¼m respectively correlation analysis shows see fig 4 that when the dosage is less than 7 5784 kg t ds cpam conditioning makes the correlation coefficient between the sludge particle size dx 90 and its dosage reach 0 9915 for the 3 synthetic hacpam products when the dosage is less than 7 5784 kg t ds as the dosage increases the particle size of the sludge flocs also continues to increase at this time the average correlation coefficient value between the amount of hacpam and the sludge floc size dx 90 reached 0 9744 see fig 4 however when the dosage was increased to 15 1569 kg t ds the particle size of the sludge flocs began to show a decreasing characteristic when the amount of flocculant is low the positive charge number and surface active sites of the flocculant are insufficient which cannot effectively neutralize and adsorb sludge particles resulting in reduced sludge dewatering performance 35 an excessive amount of flocculant will cause the colloidal system to have a high positive charge too many hydrophobic groups will repel and reduce the effect of flocculation the sludge particles will be stabilized through electrostatic repulsion and association of hydrophobic groups thereby decreasing the dehydration effect 36 therefore the dosage of 7 5784 kg t ds makes the particle size of the sludge flocs reach the peak level that is the dosage level when the sludge dewatering performance is the best which is consistent with the results of past research the amount of flocculant such as cpam is significant in sludge conditioning because the excess will increase the cost and reduce the dewatering capacity of the sludge 37 according to the report by luo et al 38 when the cpam dosage is 15 kg t ds the sludge dewatering performance reaches the best dewatering point however when the amount of cpam reached 20 kg t ds the dehydration point deteriorated sharply jun zhou et al 34 studied the influence of the molecular weight of cationic polyacrylamide cpam on sludge dewatering and water evaporation the optimal dose under different molecular weights and charges is 4 10 kg t ds from the perspective of the relationship between particle size and molecular weight the particle size of sludge flocs dx 90 increases with the increase in the molecular weight of hacpam the larger the molecular weight of hacpam is the larger the particle size of the flocs of the conditioning sludge which means better dehydration performance when the dosage is 7 5784 kg t ds hacpam 3 with a molecular weight of 1 04 million makes the particle size dx 90 of the sludge flocs reach 2280 Î¼m which exceeds the flocculation particle size dx 90 2110 Î¼m of the commercially available cpam product with a molecular weight of 5 43 106 although the molecular weight of the synthesized hacpam 3 is not high approximately 1 million it shows better sludge flocculation performance than cpam with a higher molecular weight which is the result of the association between the hydrophobic group and the cationic group 3 1 2 influence of hacpam coupling framework material on the particle size of flocs after adding 3 8 kg t ds of framework material to the sludge the floc size of the hacpam and cpam flocculated sludge changed significantly when quartz sand is used as the framework material see fig 5 b the amount of hacpam increases from 0 4737 kg t ds to 15 1569 kg t ds and the average particle size of sludge flocs only increases slowly from 627 Î¼m to 771 Î¼m an increase of 22 which is completely different from the sharp increase in the particle size of sludge flocs when hacpam is used alone see fig 5 a however when the amount of cpam increases continuously the particle size of sludge flocs becomes irregular when fly ash is used as the framework material see fig 5 c hacpam has a stronger flocculation and encapsulation effect than cpam which is reflected in the significant increase in the particle size of sludge flocs when using 0 4737 kg t ds to condition the sludge the floc particle size dx 90 of hacpam 1 hacpam 2 and hacpam 3 reached 792 Î¼m 1510 Î¼m and 1330 Î¼m respectively which increased by 22 132 and 104 respectively compared with cpam in the process of increasing the dosage from 0 4737 kg t ds to 3 7892 kg t ds hacpam coupled with fly ash increased the particle size of sludge flocs and further increased the dosage to 15 1569 kg t ds but the particle size decreased this finding shows that a low dosage of hacpam is more conducive to the coupling effect and the formation of a floc structure which provides a feasible way to reduce the dosage of hacpam fig 5 c shows that 3 7892 kg t ds is the best coupling dosage of hacpam 3 and fly ash and 1 8946 kg t ds is the best coupling dosage of hacpam 2 and fly ash which may be related to their molecular weight in terms of molecular weight hacpam 2 with medium molecular weight 642 931 has a lower dosage and a better flocculation effect when coupled with fly ash compared with cpam hacpam coupled with fly ash conditioning sludge with a molecular weight of 0 6 to 1 million has a stronger flocculation ability than cpam with a molecular weight of 5 to 6 million therefore when hacpam is coupled with fly ash to condition sludge it is not that the higher the molecular weight the better nor the greater the amount used the better but the most effective combination is a moderate molecular weight with a low amount of use in contrast hacpam is more suitable for coupling with fly ash to condition sludge than cpam this result should be due to the association of hydrophobic groups with cations comparing the two framework materials hacpam coupled fly ash has more advantages than coupled quartz sand conditioning sludge not only does it use a small amount and require a moderate molecular weight but it also makes the particle size of the sludge floc increase significantly from the perspective of the flocculation process it is obvious that the flocculation of hacpam and cpam is interfered with by the framework materials of quartz sand and fly ash which leads to significant changes in the particle size of the flocs this sludge flocculation phenomenon is the result of the coupling and synergistic effect of hacpam and cpam with the framework material respectively however using the two aggregates results in dramatic differences in the particle size of the sludge flocs which should be closely related to their physical and chemical properties the particle size dx 90 of quartz sand is 219 Î¼m and the bulk density is 1 85 g cm3 while the particle size dx 90 of fly ash is 31 5 Î¼m and the bulk density is 1 41 g cm3 the specific surface area of the two materials is also very low indicating that their adsorption capacity can be ignored the particle size of sludge flocs dx 90 133 Î¼m is far smaller than that of sand and larger than that of fly ash when added to sludge quartz sand does not easily become the core of flocculation due to its large volume and density instead it sinks quickly under the action of gravity and becomes fine sand particles that are released from the sludge even if the dosages of hacpam and cpam are very high both increase to 15 1569 kg t ds and the excess polymer molecular chain is broken due to the gravity cutting action of quartz sand and reduces the flocculation capacity therefore the floc size of hacpam coupled with quartz sand conditioning sludge will not increase significantly due to the increase in the amount of hacpam as a coupling agent fly ash produces different results in the process of flocculating sludge fly ash easily becomes the core of flocculation due to its small particle size when hacpam flocculants condition the sludge flocs it will continuously sweep the sludge flocs to wrap the fly ash and it will increase under the action of stirring which is the snowball effect even when the amount of flocculant is low such as 0 4737 kg t ds and 0 9473 kg t ds this effect is pronounced see fig 5 c this phenomenon is similar to the results of other studies hamidreza masihi et al 39 studied the effect of thermal acid modified kaolin as a framework construct on the conditioning and dewatering of waste activated sludge they found that the cst was reduced by 70 8 and the particle size of waste activated sludge increased from 47 8 Î¼m to 451 Î¼m this result is precise because the particle size of kaolin is much smaller than that of sludge which easily becomes the core of flocculation particles the particle size of the flocs increases continuously thereby improving the dewatering performance of the sludge 3 2 changes in sludge dewatering performance under gravity 3 2 1 cst the cst of sludge reflects the amount of free water in the sludge under gravity the smaller the value is the more free water that can be easily removed in the sludge and the better the sludge dewatering performance is usually the cst is less than 20 s and it can be considered that the dehydration performance is better 40 fig 6 a shows that the cst of the municipal surplus sludge used for the test is 186 s which indicates that it is challenging to dehydrate by gravity therefore it is necessary to add flocculants to enhance the dewatering performance of sludge when the flocculant is used alone the cst of sludge decreases significantly as the dosage increases in the process of increasing the dosage from 0 4736 kg t ds to 15 1569 kg t ds the average cst of the sludge conditioned by the three types of hacpam decreased from 168 s to 47 s a decrease of 72 2 and the cst of the sludge conditioned by cpam decreased from 152 s to 92 s a reduction of 39 7 a total of 7 5784 kg t ds is the optimal dosage level of hacpam and cpam although the particle size of hacpam flocculated sludge is slightly smaller than that of cpam see fig 3 hacpam can improve the dewatering performance of sludge better than cpam because hacpam contains many hydrophobic groups to drive out the bound water of sludge flocs with the result of converting it into free water therefore the particle size of sludge flocs is not the only factor determining sludge dewatering performance the association of hydrophobic groups that drives water away is more important when hacpam is coupled with 3 8 kg t ds of quartz sand see fig 6 b and 3 8 kg t ds of fly ash see fig 6 c the cst of sludge does not vary with the amount of hacpam it increases and decreases sharply but fixed within a range of values which has nothing to do with the increase in dosage when a low dosage of 0 4736 kg t ds is used hacpam can easily couple with the framework material to make the sludge flocculate the structure flocculates to drive and release the bound water in the flocs to improve the dewatering performance of the sludge therefore when the framework material is used for coupling it is beneficial to reduce hacpam flocculant and achieve better dewatering performance when the amount of hacpam is increased free water is released from the sludge flocs under the action of flocculation sweeping and hydrophobic groups this free water does not form a real free state nevertheless it is bound in the sludge particles under the dual action of the hacpam chain structure and its coupled framework material resulting in insufficient gravity to release this free water effectively therefore the cst of the sludge did not decrease with the increase in the amount of hacpam but remained in a stable range this phenomenon coincides with the size of the sludge particle size fig 5 b and c forming an excellent correspondence which is consistent with similar research results shiva a et al 41 investigated the effect of the coagulation flocculation hybrid system on the flocculation and dewatering efficiency of mbr activated sludge and found that the sludge cst has a good correlation with the size of flocs when hacpam is coupled with quartz sand the sludge cst varies from 88 s to 131 s the particle size dx 90 is from 627 Î¼m to 771 Î¼m the increase in particle size is small and the variation range is small when hacpam is coupled with fly ash the variation range increases to 82 s 143 s the particle size dx 90 increases to approximately 1210 Î¼m the increase in particle size is significant and the variation range is also significant therefore using fly ash as a framework material is more conducive to the coupling of hacpam to form larger particle size sludge flocs and obtain a lower cst which is more conducive to improving the sludge flocculation and dewatering performance in addition compared with cpam the cst values of the three types of hacpam coupled with quartz sand or fly ash are all lower indicating that hacpam has better flocculation ability to improve sludge dewatering performance and the greater the molecular weight of hacpam the lower the cst value of the sludge and the better the dewatering performance of the sludge which is reflected in the sludge particle size relationship fig 5 3 2 2 settling velocity the settling velocity reflects the settling speed of the sludge under the action of gravity the faster the settling rate is the better the sedimentation performance indicating that the sludge is easier to dehydrate when the sludge is adjusted with a dosage of 7 5784 kg t ds see fig 7 a the sludge settlement ratio of hacpam 1 hacapm 2 and hacpam 3 drops rapidly at 1 min from the initial 100 to 70 61 5 and 55 respectively subsequently with the extension of time the settling velocity showed a very slow decline indicating that the flocculation and sedimentation ability of hacpam for sludge was very fast on the other hand the larger the molecular weight of hacpam the faster the rate of flocculation and sedimentation the longer the molecular chain is the more conducive it is to sweep more sludge flocs into agglomerates increasing the particle size and density and sinking quickly this result corresponds to the particle size in fig 3 compared with commercially available cpam with a molecular weight of 5 43 million hacpam with a molecular weight of 1 04 million has a stronger ability to flocculate sludge the reason may be that the association between the hydrophobic groups in hacpam increases the molecular chain length enhancing the pollution sweeping capacity of sludge flocs when 7 5784 kg t ds hacpam was coupled with 3 8 kg t ds quartz sand conditioning sludge see fig 7 b the sludge settling velocity of hacpam 1 hacapm 2 and hacpam 3 at 1 min also decreased rapidly from the initial 100 to 69 1 57 2 and 50 respectively subsequently with the extension of time the settling velocity still decreased slowly indicating that hacpam coupled with quartz sand increased sludge flocculation and sedimentation capacity and the larger the molecular weight was the better the flocculation and sedimentation performance however cpam coupled with quartz sand shows better flocculation and settling performance closely related to the larger particle size produced when flocculating sludge see fig 5 b therefore hacpam coupled with quartz sand has fewer advantages than cpam coupled with quartz sand to flocculate sludge the reason may be that the particle size of quartz sand is larger and a larger molecular weight is required to form a longer molecular chain to flocculate sludge with quartz sand as the core resulting in a larger particle size and better sedimentation performance when hacpam couples with fly ash to condition the sludge see fig 7 c the situation changes although similarly the larger the molecular weight of hacpam is the better the flocculation and settling performance of sludge but the particle size of fly ash is smaller hacpam can use fly ash as the core of flocculation under the association of hydrophobic groups to produce a larger sludge particle size see fig 5 c among them hacpam 3 has better flocculation and settling performance for sludge than cpam this value represents the hydrophobic groups forming associations between molecular chains therefore fly ash with a smaller particle size is more suitable to form a coupling effect with hacpam synergistically condition sludge and perform better sludge dewatering performance 3 3 changes in sludge dewatering performance under mechanical force 3 3 1 water distribution under centrifugal force different mechanical dehydration methods will lead to different dehydration results under the action of mechanical centrifugal force as the amount of hacpam increases the amount of free water removed from the sludge also increases see fig 8 a among them hacpam 3 has the most obvious performance when the dosage is 7 5748 kg t ds the amount of free water removed reaches 90 9 which indicates that less bound water remains in the sludge and that the efficiency of sludge dewatering is greatly improved this should be the result of its large molecular weight which is more conducive to flocculating sludge moreover with the help of mechanical centrifugal force hacpam 3 can remove more free water than cpam at 7 5748 kg t ds the amount of free water removed by hacpam 3 is 1 8 higher than that of cpam therefore hacpam with a molecular weight of 1 04 million is more suitable for centrifugal mechanical dehydration than cpam with a molecular weight of 5 43 million when hacpam couples with quartz sand fig 8 b and fly ash fig 8 c this situation will change the amount of free water that can be removed does not increase as the amount of hacpam increases instead it has nothing to do with the further increase by the dosage which is stable within a small range the change range is increased from 86 8 to 89 2 that is within 2 4 of the blank control treatment which formed a very correlated relationship to the change characteristics of particle size fig 5 b and c and cst results fig 6 b and c the reason may be that hacpam coupling quartz sand and fly ash formed floc particles wrapping the free water and producing a blocking phenomenon and the water retention effect was formed even with the help of mechanical centrifugal force this part of the trapped water cannot be effectively removed when hacpam is coupled with quartz sand fig 8 b only when its dosage reaches 15 1569 kg t ds can hacpam 3 remove 89 0 of free water from sludge when hacpam is coupled with fly ash fig 8 c its dosage is only 0 4737 kg t ds hacpam 3 can remove 89 2 of free water from sludge which shows that both low dose hacpam coupled with fly ash and high dose hacpam coupled with quartz sand can achieve a good dehydration effect which provides an effective way to reduce the amount of hacpam therefore hacpam coupled with fly ash is more conducive to mechanical centrifugal dewatering 3 3 2 water distribution under suction filtration 3 3 2 1 the influence of hacpam dosage on the water content of sludge cake under suction filtration suction filtration is also an essential method of mechanical sludge dewatering its working principle is to separate sludge and free water through the filtration action of the filter membrane under negative pressure suction when hacpam conditioned the sludge fig 9 a with increasing dosage the water content of the sludge cake decreased slightly from a blank control water content of 82 4 to 80 9 in other words after adding hacpam the suction filtration effect makes the maximum drop in the water content of the sludge cake only 1 5 therefore the water content of the sludge cake will not increase with increasing hacpam dosage but will maintain a small decreasing range which has nothing to do with further increasing the dosage even when the dosage is increased to more than 7 5784 kg t ds the water content of the sludge cake is higher than that of the blank control treatment and the sludge dewatering performance becomes worse forming a strong blocking effect zone as is the case with commercially available cpam products an excessive dosage causes this the molecular chains block the pores of the filter membrane and the free water in the sludge cannot pass through the filter membrane sorensen et al 42 found that in the process of sludge dewatering a small particle size will increase the filtration resistance and block the channels in the sludge cake and filter cloth thereby reducing the dewatering capacity of the sludge compared with commercially available cpam hacpam 3 still has a better dehydration effect however from the perspective of the decrease in the water content of the sludge cake the use of hacpam or cpam alone to condition the sludge is not suitable for mechanical suction filtration for dewatering because the addition of organic synthetic polymers effectively condenses the sludge particles and increases the size of the flocs however the compressibility remains unchanged so organic synthetic polymers are not suitable for high pressure dehydration therefore organic synthetic polymers alone are usually used in the pretreatment of belt dehydration and centrifugal dehydration processes 3 when hacpam is coupled with quartz sand fig 9 b and fly ash fig 9 c the water content of the sludge cake continues to decrease as the amount of hacpam increases when the dosage of hacpam 3 is lower than 0 9473 kg t ds the water content of the sludge cake under the suction filter is reduced to 80 7 which is lower than the lowest moisture content of 80 9 in the sludge cake when hacpam 3 is used alone when the dosage exceeds 7 5784 kg t ds the water content of the sludge cake is reduced to 76 1 the retardation effect completely disappears and a good framework support effect is formed this result may be due to hacpam coupled with quartz sand or fly ash driving bound water through hydrophobic groups turning it into free water and removing it from the sludge flocs through the drainage channel established by the support of the skeleton compared with commercially available cpam hacpam coupled with the framework material makes the water content of the sludge cake lower under the same dosage conditions this finding shows that hacpam is more suitable for coupling with the framework material under the association function of the hydrophobic group and further improves the efficiency of sludge dewatering therefore the hacpam coupling framework material is more suitable for dehydration by suction filtration or filter press in addition by comparing the effects of coupling the two framework materials the water content of the obtained sludge cake is the same and the larger particle quartz sand does not produce obvious dehydration advantages over the smaller particle fly ash therefore particle size is not a decisive factor in the construction of drainage channels from the perspective of the sludge reduction effect when hacpam is used alone the water content of the sludge cake is reduced from 82 4 to 80 9 and the weight of each ton of sludge can be reduced by 15 kg when coupled with the framework material of 3 8 kg t ds the water content of the sludge cake can be reduced to 76 1 after deducting the weight gain of the framework material the net weight of each ton of sludge can be reduced by 62 kg therefore hacpam coupled with the framework material to condition the sludge the sludge reduction effect is very obvious in the suction filtration or press filtration way therefore it has important application value 3 3 2 2 3d structure of sludge cake the 3d scanning image is direct evidence to analyze the structure activity relationship between the pore structure of sludge cake and capillary flow the more pore structure there is the higher the porosity indicating that more bound water remains in the sludge cake fig 10 is a 3d structure diagram of the sludge cake under a suction filter by ct scanning technology when the sludge was conditioned by cpam and hacpam 3 and their coupled framework materials fig 10 shows that a certain pore structure remains in all the processed sludge cakes forming connected pore channels these pore channels are the location space created by the capillary action of the sludge flocs which binds the water these spaces accumulate bound water that is difficult to remove by mechanical suction filtration so the sludge cake still contains a large amount of water when 7 5784 kg t ds cpam and hacpam were used to condition the sludge the pore structure of the sludge cake was higher than that of the control the porosities were 5 893 and 3 642 while the blank control was 3 392 fig 11 the deterioration of the dehydration performance may be caused by the clogging of the filter membrane caused by the excessive amount of the agent when 7 5784 kg t ds cpam is used to couple 3 8 kg t ds quartz sand and fly ash conditioning sludge the pore structure of the sludge cake coupled with quartz sand treatment is significantly less and the porosity is 2 998 which is far lower than that of the coupled fly ash treatment 5 433 compared with cpam when hacpam 3 of 7 5784 kg t ds is coupled with 3 8 kg t ds of quartz sand and fly ash conditioning sludge the pore structure of the sludge cake is significantly reduced fig 10 the porosity is 2 939 while the porosity of the coupled fly ash treatment is only 1 828 therefore hacpam coupled with fly ash conditioning sludge is suitable for sludge dewatering using mechanical suction filtration and dewatering maximizing the dewatering efficiency in addition fig 11 shows that the porosity of the sludge cake and the water content of the sludge cake show excellent consistency that is the higher the porosity is the higher the water content of the mud cake the pore structure of the sludge cake is the storage space for capillary water which is consistent with past research zheng dengheng et al 28 used x ray computed tomography to build a 3d reconstruction image of the sludge analyzed the changes in the microstructure of the sludge under different vacuum pressures and obtained a good correlation between the final moisture content and the pore characteristics the analysis of the 3d scanning image of the sludge cake shows that the sludge floc flocculant framework material and water are subjected to mechanical forces in three dimensional space and the structural system is constantly deformed as a result the hydrophobic group of hacpam continuously drives the water to free form and is released from the sludge floc under the support of the framework material in the release process skeleton material is used to construct drainage channels and the flocs and skeleton material continuously squeeze these drainage channels to cause blockage as the pressure increases it breaks through the blockage and establishes a new drainage channel in a new direction to achieve a continuous dehydration process and ultimately improve the dehydration efficiency which may be the mechanism of the three dimensional structure change in the sludge dehydration process 3 4 analysis of sludge flocculation mechanism fig 12 a is a schematic diagram of the mechanism of cpam flocculating sludge the mechanism of cpam conditioning sludge is mainly through electric neutralization changing the colloid s surface charge or colloidal structure in the sludge suspension solution and overcoming the repulsive force between the sludge particles under the action of adsorption bridging contact collision net catching and rolling sweep large colloidal particle molecules are formed and the volume of the flocs expands rapidly resulting in a significant reduction in the surface area of the sludge colloidal particles the water distribution on the surface and the inside of the sludge flocs is redistributed the internal water migrates into a surface adsorption bound state or the surface adsorption bound state migrates into a free state which greatly reduces the physical adsorption of water and improves the dewatering performance of the sludge 2 3 fig 12 b is a schematic diagram of the mechanism of hacpam flocculating sludge hacpam is polymerized by introducing hydrophobic groups based on cationic polyacrylamide cpam theoretically in addition to the adsorption bridging and electrical neutralization of cpam the flocculation mechanism of hacpam also has an enhanced hydrophobic association bridging effect due to the introduction of hydrophobic groups the synergy of the three effects greatly enhances the flocculation performance of hacpam which has been confirmed in related research reports 43 44 hu pan et al 24 designed and synthesized a series of cs dmrs with different hydrophobicities but similar charge densities and found that cs dmrs showed excellent sludge dewatering performance in addition to charge neutralization the hydrophobic association effect of cs dmrs plays an important role in forming drainage channels and network porous structures in the sludge cake to improve its permeability and filterability on the one hand the hydrophobic groups change the molecular conformation of the polymer in the solution to reduce the free energy of the interface hydrophobic groups produce strong associations they tend to aggregate to minimize contact with water thereby enhancing the adsorption bridging effect between the polymers the hydrophobic group also makes the copolymer and the surface of the sludge flocs have a hydrophobic association to form a bridging effect the hydrophilicity of the flocs is reduced and the phase change ability is improved thereby promoting the conversion of bound water in the flocs into free water flocs are easier to separate from water and settle 25 it is feasible to implant hydrophobic groups in the structure of cpam 45 46 in addition to satisfying the electric neutralization flocculation effect with the negative charge of the sludge flocs hydrophobic groups play an important role in enhancing the hydrophobicity of sludge and flocculation and sedimentation increasing the dewatering capacity of flocs and increasing the strength of the filter cake after introducing hydrophobic groups into the macromolecules of the cationic acrylamide copolymer flocculant the interaction between the polymer molecular chains is enhanced due to the hydrophobic association which has a stronger adsorption bridging effect and thus a stronger flocculation ability at the same time the introduction of hydrophobic groups can enhance the interaction between polymer and organic matter reduce the hydrophilicity of flocs accelerate the settling speed of flocs and meet the needs of sludge dewatering therefore hacpam has the common characteristics of both hydrophobic and cationic groups to improve sludge dewatering performance when hacpam is coupled with quartz sand fig 12 c the particle size of quartz sand is large and it is difficult to form a flocculation core nevertheless it can be used as a framework to support the spatial structure of flocs thereby constructing water drainage channels however under the action of hacpam the sludge flocculates to form granules these granulated sludge flocs will block the drainage channels between the sand grains so that hacpam coupled with quartz sand does not form an excellent positive coupling effect as a result the efficiency of sludge dewatering has not been significantly improved when hacpam is coupled with fly ash fig 12 d the particle size of fly ash is small which easily becomes the core of flocculation under the action of hacpam the particle size of sludge flocculation increases significantly and a larger space is formed between the particles the structure can sufficiently support the spatial structure of the flocs driven by the hydrophobic groups the bound water in the sludge flocs will be continuously discharged from the spatial structure thereby exhibiting better dehydration performance therefore hacpam coupled with fly ash flocculated sludge can further improve the dewatering efficiency of sludge 4 conclusion in this study hacpam was obtained by uv induced aqueous micellar polymerization and coupled with quartz sand and fly ash to study sludge flocculation and conditioning and dewatering the main research results are as follows 1 the larger the molecular weight of hacpam is the larger the particle size of the sludge flocs the lower the cst the faster the flocculation and sedimentation rate and the better the dehydration performance high molecular weight hacpam 3 can better improve the dewatering efficiency of sludge compared with cpam with a molecular weight of 5 43 million it has better sludge flocculation and settling performance the amount of hacpam has an excellent correlation with the particle size of sludge flocs the dosage of 7 5784 kg t ds makes the particle size of the sludge flocs reach the peak level and the sludge dewatering performance is the best in terms of dehydration hacpam alone is more suitable for mechanical centrifugal dehydration than cpam and hacpam 3 with a high molecular weight is more effective 2 the flocculation of hacpam is interfered with by the framework materials quartz sand and fly ash resulting in significant changes in the sludge floc particle size cst settling performance centrifugal free water content and sludge cake water content this is the result of hacpam coupling with the framework materials 3 when hacpam couples quartz sand and fly ash to flocculate sludge quartz sand becomes the supporting material of the flocculation framework and fly ash becomes the core of particle flocculation thus exhibiting different dehydration performance characteristics low dose hacpam 3 coupling fly ash and high dose hacpam 3 coupling quartz sand can achieve better dehydration effects but hacpam 3 coupling fly ash has more advantages than hacpam3 coupling quartz sand for sludge treatment compared with cpam hacpam is more suitable for coupling with framework materials to improve the efficiency of sludge dewatering suction filtration or filter press mechanical dewatering is the most suitable choice 4 the pore structure remaining in the sludge cake is not only the drainage channel of water in sludge flocs but also the location space where the water is restricted the porosity of the sludge cake and the water content of the sludge cake show excellent consistency the higher the porosity is the higher the water content of the sludge cake is hacpam coupling with fly ash has a lower porosity than coupling with quartz sand hacpam is more suitable for coupling with fly ash to improve sludge dewatering performance declaration of

13200,to further improve the performance of sludge dewatering this study used the uv light initiated aqueous micellar polymerization method to obtain hydrophobic associating cationic polyacrylamide hacpam as a flocculant and coupled it with quartz sand and fly ash to investigate sludge flocculation and dewatering the results show that the flocculation of hacpam is interfered with by the framework material quartz sand and fly ash which leads to significant changes in the sludge floc particle size capillary suction time cst settlement performance and other indicators this is the result of the coupling between hacpam and the framework materials the larger the molecular weight of hacpam the larger the particle size of the sludge flocs is and the better the dehydration performance the dosage of 7 5784 kg ton t dry solids ds is the optimum dosage level when the sludge dewatering performance is the best it is represented by the largest sludge floc size 2280 Î¼m the highest removal free water content 90 9 and the inflection point of cst change 59 3 s when hacpam is coupled with quartz sand and fly ash flocculated sludge different characteristics of dewatering performance are showed both low dose hacpam 3 coupled with fly ash and high dose hacpam 3 coupled with quartz sand can achieve better dehydration effects but the former has more advantages than the latter the 3d scanning structure explains why hacpam 3 is more suitable for coupling fly ash to improve the dewatering performance of sludge in addition the mechanism is also discussed graphical abstract unlabelled

a direct product of sewage treatment sludge dewatering is the core difficulty of sludge treatment and runs through the whole process of sludge treatment however the sludge dewatering process generally has poor dewatering performance and low dewatering efficiency and the reason is closely related to the characteristics of the sludge 1 sludge has a high content of organic matter small particles and a floc structure sludge has a large surface area and a high degree of hydrophilicity sludge makes it difficult to separate the surface adsorbed water and chemically bound water by capillary forces from the sludge flocs through mechanical dehydration 2 3 the surface of the sludge flocs is negatively charged causing them to repel each other which makes the floc structure dispersed and stable generally cationic flocculants such as cationic polyacrylamide cpam are used to condition sludge so that sludge flocs and flocculants are electrically neutralized thereby accelerating the dewatering process of sludge and improving dewatering efficiency 4 5 however the cationic flocculant pam contains many amide groups which are hydrophilic substances pam cannot cause the surface adsorbed water attached to the sludge flocs to break away into free water and be separated and removed instead it will be bound by the hydrophilic amide group and wrapped in the floc structure making it difficult to separate and remove the adsorbed water on the surface 6 7 to improve the functional limitations of cpam in the process of sludge dewatering we propose grafting hydrophobic groups into the structure of cationic hydrophilic pam groups to reduce the combination of sludge flocs and surface adsorbed water through the hydrophobic repulsion of hydrophobic groups this process drives away the surface and internal moisture attached to the sludge floc structure promotes the conversion of the adsorbed water and bound water in the sludge floc to the form of free water and interstitial water and increases the proportion of free water and interstitial water therefore the goal of improving the efficiency of sludge dewatering was achieved theoretically in addition to the adsorption bridging and electrical neutralization of cpam 2 8 the flocculation mechanism of hacpam also has a hydrophobic association bridging effect enhanced by the introduction of hydrophobic groups the three functions work together which can greatly strengthen the flocculation performance of hacpam many studies have reported on the synthetic materials and methods of hydrophobic cationic polyacrylamide which have been shown to be very stable and mature 9 12 in recent years the synthesis process of polymerization initiated by ultraviolet light 11 13 14 or ultrasonic waves 4 15 16 has been reported the method introduces ultraviolet light or ultrasonic waves based on aqueous micellar copolymerization reduces activation energy initiates a polymerization reaction at room temperature can shorten the reaction time has energy saving effect and is easy to control zheng huaili et al 11 used acrylamide am acryloxyethyl trimethylammonium chloride dac butyl acrylate ba and 2 2 azobis 2 methylpropane amide dihydrochloride v 50 as a photoinitiator to synthesize p am dac ba lee khai ern et al 17 introduced the hydrophobic cationic monomer 3 acrylamido 2 hydroxypropyltrialkylammonium chloride ahptaac into the acrylamide chain to form a hydrophobically modified cationic polyacrylamide the copolymer characteristics can be adjusted by changing the molar ratio of the hydrophobic cationic monomer 1 6 mol li peizhi et al 18 newly synthesized hydrophobically associating cationic fluorinated polypropylene modified by fluorinated acrylate and 2 perfluorooctyl ethyl acrylate fea through free radical micellar copolymerization in aqueous solution zhong lianyang et al 19 used am dmdaac and ba to carry out free radical micellar copolymerization in an aqueous solution to synthesize hacpam and applied it to the experimental study of oily wastewater treatment the oil removal rate reached 93 4 at a dose of 50 mg l studies have shown that the cationic monomer species mainly choose acryloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride 11 20 and diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride dadmac 10 21 methacryloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dmc 22 and 2 methacryloyloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dmmc 23 among which the application of dac is most widely used most of the hydrophobic monomers are alkyl substituted acrylamide acrylate and its derivatives such as butyl acrylate these studies have provided a good preliminary basis for the synthesis of hacpam there have also been some reports on the application of hydrophobically associating cationic flocculants to sludge dewatering to improve sludge dewatering performance hu pan et al 24 designed and synthesized a series of hydrophobically associated cationic starch based flocculants cs dmrs which showed excellent sludge dewatering performance zheng huaili et al 11 synthesized p am dac ba to reduce the moisture content of the dehydrated cake to 73 2 feng xin et al 25 used the hydrophobic associating cationic polyacrylamide flocculant obtained by ultraviolet light to reduce the capillary water absorption time of sludge by 42 00 compared with cpam and to increase the free water content by 28 24 compared with cpam treatment the dehydration performance was significantly improved however the efficiency of sludge dewatering is also closely related to the method of dewatering commonly used dehydration methods include gravity concentration 26 centrifugal mechanical dehydration 27 vacuum filtration dehydration 28 belt filter press dehydration 29 plate and frame filter press dehydration 30 and thermal drying dehydration 31 gravity sedimentation is only suitable for sludge thickening and the purpose is to release more free water which is the predehydration stage mechanical dehydration is a way to directly produce dehydrated cake after gravity sedimentation the purpose is to use an external force to remove free water which is an intermediate stage of dehydration thermal drying dehydration is a method after mechanical dehydration the desiccated cake is dried to sludge powder to remove the bound water which belongs to the postdehydration stage the dehydration efficiencies of centrifugal mechanical dehydration vacuum filtration dehydration and belt filter press are not high the moisture content of the sludge cake after dewatering is approximately 80 85 plate and frame filter press dehydration can reduce the moisture content of the sludge cake to 55 65 and thermal drying dehydration can further dry the sludge cake with a moisture content of 55 85 to 20 40 the mechanical dewatering efficiency of sludge is usually not high the reason is that the floc structure of the sludge itself is soft and the organic matter in the sludge will be compressed and deformed under the action of external pressure so that the filtration and drainage channels of the water in the sludge cake are blocked and the greater the pressure is the more serious the blockage of the drainage channel which in turn leads to the low efficiency of filter press dehydration therefore a certain amount of inorganic inert and compressive strength materials such as fly ash quartz sand lime or gypsum are added in advance for conditioning to form a rigid grid skeleton support structure in the sludge which serves as the backbone of the structure the aim is to solve the problem of sludge compressibility however this kind of framework structure only has a rigid lattice structure and it is filled with highly compressed sludge flocs due to the high hydrophilicity of the sludge itself the water is restricted and difficult to discharge in past dehydration practice although pam has been applied on a large scale in the dehydration process of mechanical filter presses the compressibility and hydrophilicity of sludge flocs and the hydrophilicity of pam are intertwined during the filter press process and jointly produce a water retention effect on moisture therefore it can be imagined that if hacpam with a hydrophobic structure is innovatively coupled with fly ash or quartz sand to condition the sludge a mechanical filter press dehydration experiment is carried out it can not only exert the powerful flocculation function of organic polymer flocculant but also exert the framework support function of inert materials so that the two can establish a coupling framework structure in the sludge produce drainage channels and produce superior dehydration effects for these reasons this study used the uv light initiated aqueous micellar polymerization method to obtain hacpam with hydrophobic function promote the conversion of bound water in the sludge flocs to free water and couple it with the framework material to jointly condition the sludge to overcome the limitation of the floc s soft structure to discuss the change characteristics of the improvement of sludge dewatering performance search for a more suitable sludge dewatering method under this coupling effect and promote the further development of sludge dewatering research 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the test materials include hacpam synthetic raw materials and sludge dewatering test materials the synthetic raw

shown in fig 1 and the parameters and product properties of three synthetic copolymers hacpam 1 hacpam 2 and hacpam 3 are shown in table 3 the method of measuring copolymer properties refers to the method of feng et al 32 1 grafting ratio weight of grafted polymer weight of substrate 100 2 2 2 sewage sludge conditioning methods the sludge dewatering performance test is carried out in two steps the first step was to take 500 ml of the remaining sludge place it in a 1 l beaker add the hacpam copolymer solution according to a certain amount and stir for 3 min at a stirring speed of 80 rpm then 500 ml of the remaining sludge was placed in a 1 l beaker first quartz sand or fly ash aggregate was added at 3 8 kg t ds and stirred at 250 rpm for 5 min then the optimal amount of hacpam graft copolymer solution was added and stirred at 80 rpm for 3 min to condition the sludge sampling and analyzing the changes in sludge dewatering performance indicators each treatment was repeated 3 times 2 2 3 sludge dewatering performance test method 2 2 3 1 particle size analysis the particle size was measured by a malvern company ms3000 laser particle size analyzer during the measurement the stirring intensity of the solution was 500 rpm to prevent the particle flocs from being destroyed by vigorous stirring the particle size results are expressed as cut diameters dx10 dx50 and dx90 where dx90 means that 90 of the particle size is less than or equal to dx90 2 2 3 2 capillary suction time the capillary suction time cst of sludge is the time it takes for the sludge moisture to penetrate 2 cm on the specific absorbent filter paper according to the research report of feng xin et al 33 the cst test device was homemade as shown in fig 2 a sufficient amount of sludge sample approximately 5 ml was added to the carbon fiber tube during the measurement the time it took for the water to travel from 1 cm to 3 cm on whatman 17 grade chromatographic paper was recorded with a digital video camera since the fiber distribution of the chromatographic paper is directional the time it takes for moisture to travel in the x axis and y axis directions is different so the cst value of each sludge sample is calculated using the geometric average of cstx and csty 2 cst cst x cst y 2 2 3 3 settling velocity sv one hundred milliliters of conditioned sludge was placed in a 100 ml graduated

the influence of hacpam dosage on the particle size of flocs the particle size of sludge flocs is an important reflection of sludge dewatering performance generally the larger the particle size is the better the dehydration performance he dongqin et al 1 found that the increase in sludge dewatering capacity is closely related to the increase in floc size it is more difficult to directly dehydrate the residual sludge the direct reason is that the particle size of the sludge flocs is extremely small usually 80 130 Î¼m a particle size that is too small absorbs more capillary adsorbed water and is difficult to remove by an external force therefore adding a flocculant to agglomerate sludge flocs and increase the particle size is an important method to improve the dewatering performance of sludge in this study the sludge particle size dx 90 used in the test is 133 Î¼m which is roughly the same as the sludge particle size studied in the past jun zhou et al 34 measured that the particle size of the original sludge was below 1000 Î¼m most of which were between 150 Î¼m and 500 Î¼m fig 3 shows that as the amount of commercially available cpam products increases the particle size of sludge flocs continues to increase when the dosage was increased to 3 7892 kg t ds 7 5784 kg t ds and 15 1569 kg t ds the sludge particle size dx 90 reached 1350 Î¼m 2110 Î¼m and 2480 Î¼m respectively correlation analysis shows see fig 4 that when the dosage is less than 7 5784 kg t ds cpam conditioning makes the correlation coefficient between the sludge particle size dx 90 and its dosage reach 0 9915 for the 3 synthetic hacpam products when the dosage is less than 7 5784 kg t ds as the dosage increases the particle size of the sludge flocs also continues to increase at this time the average correlation coefficient value between the amount of hacpam and the sludge floc size dx 90 reached 0 9744 see fig 4 however when the dosage was increased to 15 1569 kg t ds the particle size of the sludge flocs began to show a decreasing characteristic when the amount of flocculant is low the positive charge number and surface active sites of the flocculant are insufficient which cannot effectively neutralize and adsorb sludge particles resulting in reduced sludge dewatering performance 35 an excessive amount of flocculant will cause the colloidal system to have a high positive charge too many hydrophobic groups will repel and reduce the effect of flocculation the sludge particles will be stabilized through electrostatic repulsion and association of hydrophobic groups thereby decreasing the dehydration effect 36 therefore the dosage of 7 5784 kg t ds makes the particle size of the sludge flocs reach the peak level that is the dosage level when the sludge dewatering performance is the best which is consistent with the results of past research the amount of flocculant such as cpam is significant in sludge conditioning because the excess will increase the cost and reduce the dewatering capacity of the sludge 37 according to the report by luo et al 38 when the cpam dosage is 15 kg t ds the sludge dewatering performance reaches the best dewatering point however when the amount of cpam reached 20 kg t ds the dehydration point deteriorated sharply jun zhou et al 34 studied the influence of the molecular weight of cationic polyacrylamide cpam on sludge dewatering and water evaporation the optimal dose under different molecular weights and charges is 4 10 kg t ds from the perspective of the relationship between particle size and molecular weight the particle size of sludge flocs dx 90 increases with the increase in the molecular weight of hacpam the larger the molecular weight of hacpam is the larger the particle size of the flocs of the conditioning sludge which means better dehydration performance when the dosage is 7 5784 kg t ds hacpam 3 with a molecular weight of 1 04 million makes the particle size dx 90 of the sludge flocs reach 2280 Î¼m which exceeds the flocculation particle size dx 90 2110 Î¼m of the commercially available cpam product with a molecular weight of 5 43 106 although the molecular weight of the synthesized hacpam 3 is not high approximately 1 million it shows better sludge flocculation performance than cpam with a higher molecular weight which is the result of the association between the hydrophobic group and the cationic group 3 1 2 influence of hacpam coupling framework material on the particle size of flocs after adding 3 8 kg t ds of framework material to the sludge the floc size of the hacpam and cpam flocculated sludge changed significantly when quartz sand is used as the framework material see fig 5 b the amount of hacpam increases from 0 4737 kg t ds to 15 1569 kg t ds and the average particle size of sludge flocs only increases slowly from 627 Î¼m to 771 Î¼m an increase of 22 which is completely different from the sharp increase in the particle size of sludge flocs when hacpam is used alone see fig 5 a however when the amount of cpam increases continuously the particle size of sludge flocs becomes irregular when fly ash is used as the framework material see fig 5 c hacpam has a stronger flocculation and encapsulation effect than cpam which is reflected in the significant increase in the particle size of sludge flocs when using 0 4737 kg t ds to condition the sludge the floc particle size dx 90 of hacpam 1 hacpam 2 and hacpam 3 reached 792 Î¼m 1510 Î¼m and 1330 Î¼m respectively which increased by 22 132 and 104 respectively compared with cpam in the process of increasing the dosage from 0 4737 kg t ds to 3 7892 kg t ds hacpam coupled with fly ash increased the particle size of sludge flocs and further increased the dosage to 15 1569 kg t ds but the particle size decreased this finding shows that a low dosage of hacpam is more conducive to the coupling effect and the formation of a floc structure which provides a feasible way to reduce the dosage of hacpam fig 5 c shows that 3 7892 kg t ds is the best coupling dosage of hacpam 3 and fly ash and 1 8946 kg t ds is the best coupling dosage of hacpam 2 and fly ash which may be related to their molecular weight in terms of molecular weight hacpam 2 with medium molecular weight 642 931 has a lower dosage and a better flocculation effect when coupled with fly ash compared with cpam hacpam coupled with fly ash conditioning sludge with a molecular weight of 0 6 to 1 million has a stronger flocculation ability than cpam with a molecular weight of 5 to 6 million therefore when hacpam is coupled with fly ash to condition sludge it is not that the higher the molecular weight the better nor the greater the amount used the better but the most effective combination is a moderate molecular weight with a low amount of use in contrast hacpam is more suitable for coupling with fly ash to condition sludge than cpam this result should be due to the association of hydrophobic groups with cations comparing the two framework materials hacpam coupled fly ash has more advantages than coupled quartz sand conditioning sludge not only does it use a small amount and require a moderate molecular weight but it also makes the particle size of the sludge floc increase significantly from the perspective of the flocculation process it is obvious that the flocculation of hacpam and cpam is interfered with by the framework materials of quartz sand and fly ash which leads to significant changes in the particle size of the flocs this sludge flocculation phenomenon is the result of the coupling and synergistic effect of hacpam and cpam with the framework material respectively however using the two aggregates results in dramatic differences in the particle size of the sludge flocs which should be closely related to their physical and chemical properties the particle size dx 90 of quartz sand is 219 Î¼m and the bulk density is 1 85 g cm3 while the particle size dx 90 of fly ash is 31 5 Î¼m and the bulk density is 1 41 g cm3 the specific surface area of the two materials is also very low indicating that their adsorption capacity can be ignored the particle size of sludge flocs dx 90 133 Î¼m is far smaller than that of sand and larger than that of fly ash when added to sludge quartz sand does not easily become the core of flocculation due to its large volume and density instead it sinks quickly under the action of gravity and becomes fine sand particles that are released from the sludge even if the dosages of hacpam and cpam are very high both increase to 15 1569 kg t ds and the excess polymer molecular chain is broken due to the gravity cutting action of quartz sand and reduces the flocculation capacity therefore the floc size of hacpam coupled with quartz sand conditioning sludge will not increase significantly due to the increase in the amount of hacpam as a coupling agent fly ash produces different results in the process of flocculating sludge fly ash easily becomes the core of flocculation due to its small particle size when hacpam flocculants condition the sludge flocs it will continuously sweep the sludge flocs to wrap the fly ash and it will increase under the action of stirring which is the snowball effect even when the amount of flocculant is low such as 0 4737 kg t ds and 0 9473 kg t ds this effect is pronounced see fig 5 c this phenomenon is similar to the results of other studies hamidreza masihi et al 39 studied the effect of thermal acid modified kaolin as a framework construct on the conditioning and dewatering of waste activated sludge they found that the cst was reduced by 70 8 and the particle size of waste activated sludge increased from 47 8 Î¼m to 451 Î¼m this result is precise because the particle size of kaolin is much smaller than that of sludge which easily becomes the core of flocculation particles the particle size of the flocs increases continuously thereby improving the dewatering performance of the sludge 3 2 changes in sludge dewatering performance under gravity 3 2 1 cst the cst of sludge reflects the amount of free water in the sludge under gravity the smaller the value is the more free water that can be easily removed in the sludge and the better the sludge dewatering performance is usually the cst is less than 20 s and it can be considered that the dehydration performance is better 40 fig 6 a shows that the cst of the municipal surplus sludge used for the test is 186 s which indicates that it is challenging to dehydrate by gravity therefore it is necessary to add flocculants to enhance the dewatering performance of sludge when the flocculant is used alone the cst of sludge decreases significantly as the dosage increases in the process of increasing the dosage from 0 4736 kg t ds to 15 1569 kg t ds the average cst of the sludge conditioned by the three types of hacpam decreased from 168 s to 47 s a decrease of 72 2 and the cst of the sludge conditioned by cpam decreased from 152 s to 92 s a reduction of 39 7 a total of 7 5784 kg t ds is the optimal dosage level of hacpam and cpam although the particle size of hacpam flocculated sludge is slightly smaller than that of cpam see fig 3 hacpam can improve the dewatering performance of sludge better than cpam because hacpam contains many hydrophobic groups to drive out the bound water of sludge flocs with the result of converting it into free water therefore the particle size of sludge flocs is not the only factor determining sludge dewatering performance the association of hydrophobic groups that drives water away is more important when hacpam is coupled with 3 8 kg t ds of quartz sand see fig 6 b and 3 8 kg t ds of fly ash see fig 6 c the cst of sludge does not vary with the amount of hacpam it increases and decreases sharply but fixed within a range of values which has nothing to do with the increase in dosage when a low dosage of 0 4736 kg t ds is used hacpam can easily couple with the framework material to make the sludge flocculate the structure flocculates to drive and release the bound water in the flocs to improve the dewatering performance of the sludge therefore when the framework material is used for coupling it is beneficial to reduce hacpam flocculant and achieve better dewatering performance when the amount of hacpam is increased free water is released from the sludge flocs under the action of flocculation sweeping and hydrophobic groups this free water does not form a real free state nevertheless it is bound in the sludge particles under the dual action of the hacpam chain structure and its coupled framework material resulting in insufficient gravity to release this free water effectively therefore the cst of the sludge did not decrease with the increase in the amount of hacpam but remained in a stable range this phenomenon coincides with the size of the sludge particle size fig 5 b and c forming an excellent correspondence which is consistent with similar research results shiva a et al 41 investigated the effect of the coagulation flocculation hybrid system on the flocculation and dewatering efficiency of mbr activated sludge and found that the sludge cst has a good correlation with the size of flocs when hacpam is coupled with quartz sand the sludge cst varies from 88 s to 131 s the particle size dx 90 is from 627 Î¼m to 771 Î¼m the increase in particle size is small and the variation range is small when hacpam is coupled with fly ash the variation range increases to 82 s 143 s the particle size dx 90 increases to approximately 1210 Î¼m the increase in particle size is significant and the variation range is also significant therefore using fly ash as a framework material is more conducive to the coupling of hacpam to form larger particle size sludge flocs and obtain a lower cst which is more conducive to improving the sludge flocculation and dewatering performance in addition compared with cpam the cst values of the three types of hacpam coupled with quartz sand or fly ash are all lower indicating that hacpam has better flocculation ability to improve sludge dewatering performance and the greater the molecular weight of hacpam the lower the cst value of the sludge and the better the dewatering performance of the sludge which is reflected in the sludge particle size relationship fig 5 3 2 2 settling velocity the settling velocity reflects the settling speed of the sludge under the action of gravity the faster the settling rate is the better the sedimentation performance indicating that the sludge is easier to dehydrate when the sludge is adjusted with a dosage of 7 5784 kg t ds see fig 7 a the sludge settlement ratio of hacpam 1 hacapm 2 and hacpam 3 drops rapidly at 1 min from the initial 100 to 70 61 5 and 55 respectively subsequently with the extension of time the settling velocity showed a very slow decline indicating that the flocculation and sedimentation ability of hacpam for sludge was very fast on the other hand the larger the molecular weight of hacpam the faster the rate of flocculation and sedimentation the longer the molecular chain is the more conducive it is to sweep more sludge flocs into agglomerates increasing the particle size and density and sinking quickly this result corresponds to the particle size in fig 3 compared with commercially available cpam with a molecular weight of 5 43 million hacpam with a molecular weight of 1 04 million has a stronger ability to flocculate sludge the reason may be that the association between the hydrophobic groups in hacpam increases the molecular chain length enhancing the pollution sweeping capacity of sludge flocs when 7 5784 kg t ds hacpam was coupled with 3 8 kg t ds quartz sand conditioning sludge see fig 7 b the sludge settling velocity of hacpam 1 hacapm 2 and hacpam 3 at 1 min also decreased rapidly from the initial 100 to 69 1 57 2 and 50 respectively subsequently with the extension of time the settling velocity still decreased slowly indicating that hacpam coupled with quartz sand increased sludge flocculation and sedimentation capacity and the larger the molecular weight was the better the flocculation and sedimentation performance however cpam coupled with quartz sand shows better flocculation and settling performance closely related to the larger particle size produced when flocculating sludge see fig 5 b therefore hacpam coupled with quartz sand has fewer advantages than cpam coupled with quartz sand to flocculate sludge the reason may be that the particle size of quartz sand is larger and a larger molecular weight is required to form a longer molecular chain to flocculate sludge with quartz sand as the core resulting in a larger particle size and better sedimentation performance when hacpam couples with fly ash to condition the sludge see fig 7 c the situation changes although similarly the larger the molecular weight of hacpam is the better the flocculation and settling performance of sludge but the particle size of fly ash is smaller hacpam can use fly ash as the core of flocculation under the association of hydrophobic groups to produce a larger sludge particle size see fig 5 c among them hacpam 3 has better flocculation and settling performance for sludge than cpam this value represents the hydrophobic groups forming associations between molecular chains therefore fly ash with a smaller particle size is more suitable to form a coupling effect with hacpam synergistically condition sludge and perform better sludge dewatering performance 3 3 changes in sludge dewatering performance under mechanical force 3 3 1 water distribution under centrifugal force different mechanical dehydration methods will lead to different dehydration results under the action of mechanical centrifugal force as the amount of hacpam increases the amount of free water removed from the sludge also increases see fig 8 a among them hacpam 3 has the most obvious performance when the dosage is 7 5748 kg t ds the amount of free water removed reaches 90 9 which indicates that less bound water remains in the sludge and that the efficiency of sludge dewatering is greatly improved this should be the result of its large molecular weight which is more conducive to flocculating sludge moreover with the help of mechanical centrifugal force hacpam 3 can remove more free water than cpam at 7 5748 kg t ds the amount of free water removed by hacpam 3 is 1 8 higher than that of cpam therefore hacpam with a molecular weight of 1 04 million is more suitable for centrifugal mechanical dehydration than cpam with a molecular weight of 5 43 million when hacpam couples with quartz sand fig 8 b and fly ash fig 8 c this situation will change the amount of free water that can be removed does not increase as the amount of hacpam increases instead it has nothing to do with the further increase by the dosage which is stable within a small range the change range is increased from 86 8 to 89 2 that is within 2 4 of the blank control treatment which formed a very correlated relationship to the change characteristics of particle size fig 5 b and c and cst results fig 6 b and c the reason may be that hacpam coupling quartz sand and fly ash formed floc particles wrapping the free water and producing a blocking phenomenon and the water retention effect was formed even with the help of mechanical centrifugal force this part of the trapped water cannot be effectively removed when hacpam is coupled with quartz sand fig 8 b only when its dosage reaches 15 1569 kg t ds can hacpam 3 remove 89 0 of free water from sludge when hacpam is coupled with fly ash fig 8 c its dosage is only 0 4737 kg t ds hacpam 3 can remove 89 2 of free water from sludge which shows that both low dose hacpam coupled with fly ash and high dose hacpam coupled with quartz sand can achieve a good dehydration effect which provides an effective way to reduce the amount of hacpam therefore hacpam coupled with fly ash is more conducive to mechanical centrifugal dewatering 3 3 2 water distribution under suction filtration 3 3 2 1 the influence of hacpam dosage on the water content of sludge cake under suction filtration suction filtration is also an essential method of mechanical sludge dewatering its working principle is to separate sludge and free water through the filtration action of the filter membrane under negative pressure suction when hacpam conditioned the sludge fig 9 a with increasing dosage the water content of the sludge cake decreased slightly from a blank control water content of 82 4 to 80 9 in other words after adding hacpam the suction filtration effect makes the maximum drop in the water content of the sludge cake only 1 5 therefore the water content of the sludge cake will not increase with increasing hacpam dosage but will maintain a small decreasing range which has nothing to do with further increasing the dosage even when the dosage is increased to more than 7 5784 kg t ds the water content of the sludge cake is higher than that of the blank control treatment and the sludge dewatering performance becomes worse forming a strong blocking effect zone as is the case with commercially available cpam products an excessive dosage causes this the molecular chains block the pores of the filter membrane and the free water in the sludge cannot pass through the filter membrane sorensen et al 42 found that in the process of sludge dewatering a small particle size will increase the filtration resistance and block the channels in the sludge cake and filter cloth thereby reducing the dewatering capacity of the sludge compared with commercially available cpam hacpam 3 still has a better dehydration effect however from the perspective of the decrease in the water content of the sludge cake the use of hacpam or cpam alone to condition the sludge is not suitable for mechanical suction filtration for dewatering because the addition of organic synthetic polymers effectively condenses the sludge particles and increases the size of the flocs however the compressibility remains unchanged so organic synthetic polymers are not suitable for high pressure dehydration therefore organic synthetic polymers alone are usually used in the pretreatment of belt dehydration and centrifugal dehydration processes 3 when hacpam is coupled with quartz sand fig 9 b and fly ash fig 9 c the water content of the sludge cake continues to decrease as the amount of hacpam increases when the dosage of hacpam 3 is lower than 0 9473 kg t ds the water content of the sludge cake under the suction filter is reduced to 80 7 which is lower than the lowest moisture content of 80 9 in the sludge cake when hacpam 3 is used alone when the dosage exceeds 7 5784 kg t ds the water content of the sludge cake is reduced to 76 1 the retardation effect completely disappears and a good framework support effect is formed this result may be due to hacpam coupled with quartz sand or fly ash driving bound water through hydrophobic groups turning it into free water and removing it from the sludge flocs through the drainage channel established by the support of the skeleton compared with commercially available cpam hacpam coupled with the framework material makes the water content of the sludge cake lower under the same dosage conditions this finding shows that hacpam is more suitable for coupling with the framework material under the association function of the hydrophobic group and further improves the efficiency of sludge dewatering therefore the hacpam coupling framework material is more suitable for dehydration by suction filtration or filter press in addition by comparing the effects of coupling the two framework materials the water content of the obtained sludge cake is the same and the larger particle quartz sand does not produce obvious dehydration advantages over the smaller particle fly ash therefore particle size is not a decisive factor in the construction of drainage channels from the perspective of the sludge reduction effect when hacpam is used alone the water content of the sludge cake is reduced from 82 4 to 80 9 and the weight of each ton of sludge can be reduced by 15 kg when coupled with the framework material of 3 8 kg t ds the water content of the sludge cake can be reduced to 76 1 after deducting the weight gain of the framework material the net weight of each ton of sludge can be reduced by 62 kg therefore hacpam coupled with the framework material to condition the sludge the sludge reduction effect is very obvious in the suction filtration or press filtration way therefore it has important application value 3 3 2 2 3d structure of sludge cake the 3d scanning image is direct evidence to analyze the structure activity relationship between the pore structure of sludge cake and capillary flow the more pore structure there is the higher the porosity indicating that more bound water remains in the sludge cake fig 10 is a 3d structure diagram of the sludge cake under a suction filter by ct scanning technology when the sludge was conditioned by cpam and hacpam 3 and their coupled framework materials fig 10 shows that a certain pore structure remains in all the processed sludge cakes forming connected pore channels these pore channels are the location space created by the capillary action of the sludge flocs which binds the water these spaces accumulate bound water that is difficult to remove by mechanical suction filtration so the sludge cake still contains a large amount of water when 7 5784 kg t ds cpam and hacpam were used to condition the sludge the pore structure of the sludge cake was higher than that of the control the porosities were 5 893 and 3 642 while the blank control was 3 392 fig 11 the deterioration of the dehydration performance may be caused by the clogging of the filter membrane caused by the excessive amount of the agent when 7 5784 kg t ds cpam is used to couple 3 8 kg t ds quartz sand and fly ash conditioning sludge the pore structure of the sludge cake coupled with quartz sand treatment is significantly less and the porosity is 2 998 which is far lower than that of the coupled fly ash treatment 5 433 compared with cpam when hacpam 3 of 7 5784 kg t ds is coupled with 3 8 kg t ds of quartz sand and fly ash conditioning sludge the pore structure of the sludge cake is significantly reduced fig 10 the porosity is 2 939 while the porosity of the coupled fly ash treatment is only 1 828 therefore hacpam coupled with fly ash conditioning sludge is suitable for sludge dewatering using mechanical suction filtration and dewatering maximizing the dewatering efficiency in addition fig 11 shows that the porosity of the sludge cake and the water content of the sludge cake show excellent consistency that is the higher the porosity is the higher the water content of the mud cake the pore structure of the sludge cake is the storage space for capillary water which is consistent with past research zheng dengheng et al 28 used x ray computed tomography to build a 3d reconstruction image of the sludge analyzed the changes in the microstructure of the sludge under different vacuum pressures and obtained a good correlation between the final moisture content and the pore characteristics the analysis of the 3d scanning image of the sludge cake shows that the sludge floc flocculant framework material and water are subjected to mechanical forces in three dimensional space and the structural system is constantly deformed as a result the hydrophobic group of hacpam continuously drives the water to free form and is released from the sludge floc under the support of the framework material in the release process skeleton material is used to construct drainage channels and the flocs and skeleton material continuously squeeze these drainage channels to cause blockage as the pressure increases it breaks through the blockage and establishes a new drainage channel in a new direction to achieve a continuous dehydration process and ultimately improve the dehydration efficiency which may be the mechanism of the three dimensional structure change in the sludge dehydration process 3 4 analysis of sludge flocculation mechanism fig 12 a is a schematic diagram of the mechanism of cpam flocculating sludge the mechanism of cpam conditioning sludge is mainly through electric neutralization changing the colloid s surface charge or colloidal structure in the sludge suspension solution and overcoming the repulsive force between the sludge particles under the action of adsorption bridging contact collision net catching and rolling sweep large colloidal particle molecules are formed and the volume of the flocs expands rapidly resulting in a significant reduction in the surface area of the sludge colloidal particles the water distribution on the surface and the inside of the sludge flocs is redistributed the internal water migrates into a surface adsorption bound state or the surface adsorption bound state migrates into a free state which greatly reduces the physical adsorption of water and improves the dewatering performance of the sludge 2 3 fig 12 b is a schematic diagram of the mechanism of hacpam flocculating sludge hacpam is polymerized by introducing hydrophobic groups based on cationic polyacrylamide cpam theoretically in addition to the adsorption bridging and electrical neutralization of cpam the flocculation mechanism of hacpam also has an enhanced hydrophobic association bridging effect due to the introduction of hydrophobic groups the synergy of the three effects greatly enhances the flocculation performance of hacpam which has been confirmed in related research reports 43 44 hu pan et al 24 designed and synthesized a series of cs dmrs with different hydrophobicities but similar charge densities and found that cs dmrs showed excellent sludge dewatering performance in addition to charge neutralization the hydrophobic association effect of cs dmrs plays an important role in forming drainage channels and network porous structures in the sludge cake to improve its permeability and filterability on the one hand the hydrophobic groups change the molecular conformation of the polymer in the solution to reduce the free energy of the interface hydrophobic groups produce strong associations they tend to aggregate to minimize contact with water thereby enhancing the adsorption bridging effect between the polymers the hydrophobic group also makes the copolymer and the surface of the sludge flocs have a hydrophobic association to form a bridging effect the hydrophilicity of the flocs is reduced and the phase change ability is improved thereby promoting the conversion of bound water in the flocs into free water flocs are easier to separate from water and settle 25 it is feasible to implant hydrophobic groups in the structure of cpam 45 46 in addition to satisfying the electric neutralization flocculation effect with the negative charge of the sludge flocs hydrophobic groups play an important role in enhancing the hydrophobicity of sludge and flocculation and sedimentation increasing the dewatering capacity of flocs and increasing the strength of the filter cake after introducing hydrophobic groups into the macromolecules of the cationic acrylamide copolymer flocculant the interaction between the polymer molecular chains is enhanced due to the hydrophobic association which has a stronger adsorption bridging effect and thus a stronger flocculation ability at the same time the introduction of hydrophobic groups can enhance the interaction between polymer and organic matter reduce the hydrophilicity of flocs accelerate the settling speed of flocs and meet the needs of sludge dewatering therefore hacpam has the common characteristics of both hydrophobic and cationic groups to improve sludge dewatering performance when hacpam is coupled with quartz sand fig 12 c the particle size of quartz sand is large and it is difficult to form a flocculation core nevertheless it can be used as a framework to support the spatial structure of flocs thereby constructing water drainage channels however under the action of hacpam the sludge flocculates to form granules these granulated sludge flocs will block the drainage channels between the sand grains so that hacpam coupled with quartz sand does not form an excellent positive coupling effect as a result the efficiency of sludge dewatering has not been significantly improved when hacpam is coupled with fly ash fig 12 d the particle size of fly ash is small which easily becomes the core of flocculation under the action of hacpam the particle size of sludge flocculation increases significantly and a larger space is formed between the particles the structure can sufficiently support the spatial structure of the flocs driven by the hydrophobic groups the bound water in the sludge flocs will be continuously discharged from the spatial structure thereby exhibiting better dehydration performance therefore hacpam coupled with fly ash flocculated sludge can further improve the dewatering efficiency of sludge 4 conclusion in this study hacpam was obtained by uv induced aqueous micellar polymerization and coupled with quartz sand and fly ash to study sludge flocculation and conditioning and dewatering the main research results are as follows 1 the larger the molecular weight of hacpam is the larger the particle size of the sludge flocs the lower the cst the faster the flocculation and sedimentation rate and the better the dehydration performance high molecular weight hacpam 3 can better improve the dewatering efficiency of sludge compared with cpam with a molecular weight of 5 43 million it has better sludge flocculation and settling performance the amount of hacpam has an excellent correlation with the particle size of sludge flocs the dosage of 7 5784 kg t ds makes the particle size of the sludge flocs reach the peak level and the sludge dewatering performance is the best in terms of dehydration hacpam alone is more suitable for mechanical centrifugal dehydration than cpam and hacpam 3 with a high molecular weight is more effective 2 the flocculation of hacpam is interfered with by the framework materials quartz sand and fly ash resulting in significant changes in the sludge floc particle size cst settling performance centrifugal free water content and sludge cake water content this is the result of hacpam coupling with the framework materials 3 when hacpam couples quartz sand and fly ash to flocculate sludge quartz sand becomes the supporting material of the flocculation framework and fly ash becomes the core of particle flocculation thus exhibiting different dehydration performance characteristics low dose hacpam 3 coupling fly ash and high dose hacpam 3 coupling quartz sand can achieve better dehydration effects but hacpam 3 coupling fly ash has more advantages than hacpam3 coupling quartz sand for sludge treatment compared with cpam hacpam is more suitable for coupling with framework materials to improve the efficiency of sludge dewatering suction filtration or filter press mechanical dewatering is the most suitable choice 4 the pore structure remaining in the sludge cake is not only the drainage channel of water in sludge flocs but also the location space where the water is restricted the porosity of the sludge cake and the water content of the sludge cake show excellent consistency the higher the porosity is the higher the water content of the sludge cake is hacpam coupling with fly ash has a lower porosity than coupling with quartz sand hacpam is more suitable for coupling with fly ash to improve sludge dewatering performance declaration of

efficiency of fenton like processes are extensively demonstrated in the review for greater implacability of study moreover the challenges and commercial implications are outlined and discussed for possible future perspectives keywords micro pollutants fenton like process insights of mechanism bimetallic nanocomposites 1 introduction polluting the water bodies by a range of micro pollutants is becoming a severe ecological concern requiring urgent monitoring and implementation of proper and adequate remediation plans for its agreeable solutions the primary problem is the unfettered discharge of wastewaters ww from a variety of industries along with the agricultural runoffs contained with several herbicides pesticides into the receiving water bodies and led to the widespread contamination of aquatic environments a wide range of organic contaminants viz pharmaceuticals personal care products pcps endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs dyes nitrogen containing compounds halogenated aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons agrochemicals etc are readily detected in measurable quantity in the water bodies and posing a serious threat to the ecological system 1 6 the advanced treatment technologies including membrane filtration wet chemical oxidation biodegradation flocculation adsorption precipitation reduction reverse osmosis etc are proposed to eliminate emerging water contaminants from aqueous wastes however these methods are sometimes inadequate to eliminate the recalcitrant and emerging pollutants from aqueous solutions or found exceedingly expensive for possible implications additionally expensive equipment high operating costs and high maintenance limited these methods utilization further 7 moreover the environmentally sustainable remediation process is demonstrated with low energy consumption 8 less harmful byproducts that are greatly preferred therefore the researchers propose newer and advanced methods for the efficient treatment of potential recalcitrant that need to be reviewed for greater understanding among numerous treatment technologies advanced oxidation processes aops are utilized as an innovative method for efficient and enhanced degradation of recalcitrant micropollutants the process is simply based on the in situ hydroxyl radicals oh generation the hydroxyl radicals hence provide enhanced oxidation ability standard potential 2 80 v vs she as well as high rate constants for bimolecular reactions 108 1011 m 1 s 1 and non selective reactivity 9 11 it is interesting to note that the oh radical either oxidize the complex organic molecules to smaller by products or degrade completely to their end product to carbon dioxide co2 and water h2o i e the mineralization of organic molecules 12 15 in a line a variety of techniques are employed under aops viz fenton iron ii h2o2 16 photo fenton iron ii h2o2 uv ozonization o3 17 h2o2 o3 18 h2o2 uv 19 hetero homogeneous fenton like processes tio2 uv 20 au nps tio2 21 zno uv 22 also supplemented with the light 23 microwave electrical energy cavitation field etc 24 25 these aops are used with different reagents to produce the radical species e g oh ooh the aops are employed alone or it is made a hybrid system in which it is combined with other biological methods subject to the physical chemical properties of the wastewater runoff and as per the requirement of the target contaminants in wastewaters 26 the hybrid processes are composed of the initial degradation of organic molecules into the intractable organic contaminants to decomposable intermediates or by products by the aop process which is then removed by different biological post treatments likewise microbiological processes are set up as pre treatment steps followed by the residual organic segments from effluents that are subsequently removed using the aops 26 the latter process is an important pathway that involves minute quenching of reactive oxidizing radicals by the biodegradable species resulting in improved efficiency of aops and fewer expenses for the post treatment by attributing a variety of techniques and the highly efficient production of radical oxidizing species aops are widely used for groundwater and wastewater treatments 27 28 soil and sediments remediation 29 municipal sludge processing 30 or even degradation of volatile organic wastes 31 the application of nanomaterials has received greater attention worldwide and nanotechnology is quite promising in the efficient treatment of waster waters contaminated with a variety of water contaminants nanomaterials have physical dimensions ranging from 1 to 100 nm these materials compact size enabled them to have a large specific surface area and a high surface area to volume ratio which provides them several exceptional properties useful for environmental studies 32 these materials possessed strong reactivity selective affinity fast kinetics and catalytic potential which make them functional alternative materials 33 nanosorbents 34 nanocatalysts 35 bioactive nanoparticles nanostructured catalytic membranes nanomembranes and nanoparticles 36 are possibly useful to address several global water pollution problems hence the nanostructured materials are excellent new solutions for the treatment of wastewater that can enhance the elimination efficiency towards the potential organic contaminants from water bodies 37 38 the classical fenton reagents iron and hydrogen peroxide are usually investigated to degrade the hazardous organic pollutants from wastewaters or industrial effluents however despite using a large amount of iron in the classical fenton process the use of eco friendly earth abundant iron based or other less toxic metal based catalysts has received greater attention in the recent past to replace the classical fenton process the use of nanomaterials in the fenton process is a cost effective quick efficient and innovative technique some of the standard reviews 39 47 appeared addressing various aspects of the fenton fenton like processes kumar et al 45 mainly focused on eliminating pharmaceutical pollutants utilizing nanocatalysts in fenton electro fenton sono fenton photo fenton and photo electro fenton processes similarly another review discussed alternative non iron fenton catalysts and their hydrogen peroxide activation reactivity 46 li et al 47 summarise current developments in the knowledge and implementation of cu based fenton processes for the treatment of industrial wastewater the other reviews and books demonstrated the different elements of fenton reaction chemistry devoid of critical evaluation of nanomaterials based fenton like processes in the remediation of water contaminated with various micro pollutants however the present review greatly covers the recent advances in the nano catalytic fenton like systems and attempts to critically review the developments in the area further the review focuses on nano materials role in the fenton like reactions and insights of chemistry involved in such processes many researchers tried to introduce different metal nano particles in place of iron subsequently different nano materials are tried to incorporate several eco friendly supporting materials to obtain the nanocomposite or nano fenton like catalyst nflc however nanoparticles or nanocomposites mediated hetero homo fenton and fenton like reaction chemistry are needed to be studied extensively and insights need to be discussed in depth and length which is yet to be explored 39 40 42 44 46 therefore the present review focused on various metal nanocomposites utilized to decompose a variety of potential micropollutants in the fenton like reactions and a detailed study on their redox chemistry is critically evaluated with different practical advantages followed by the future scope of research 2 classical fenton fenton like modified fenton like processes 2 1 classical fenton process and its modifications the classical fenton reaction is carried out with ferrous fe2 ions and peroxides usually h2o2 to generate reactive oxygen species ros that oxidizes both the organic as well as inorganic compounds the fenton reaction was first introduced in 1894 by h j h fenton where he studied the redox reactions involved in the oxidation of tartaric acid 48 many researchers studied the mechanism of the reaction and it was described most commonly as eq 1 fig 1 40 49 51 1 fe 2 h 2 o 2 h fe 3 h 2 o oh various physico chemical parameters viz ph the dose of fenton reagent and initial organic pollutant concentrations are the driving force carrying the fenton process however a critical parameter is the solution ph of the treatment 44 in aqueous solutions although iron ii species remained with the soluble state even at neutral ph conditions however the iron iii species starts forming hydroxo species at ph 4 and thereby the efficiency of the fenton process diminishes 52 the speciation diagram of iron shows that ph 2 8 to 3 2 is the optimum ph range for the fenton process fig 2 46 some other researchers also showed that the ph range of 2 to 4 could provide an optimum treatment efficiency in the fenton process 53 56 since wastewater samples are not found within this ph range to attain the optimal ph range of the fenton process a high amount of acid is added to adjust the ph of wastewater samples prior to operating the fenton process hence this significantly increases the overall treatment cost depending on the catalysts used the fenton process was categorized into two types homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton processes in the homogeneous process whole reacting species are in the same phase i e liquid phase but homogeneous fenton reactions have a few disadvantages like it requires a relatively higher iron dose 50 80 ppm with a limited ph range to carry out the process 41 this led the researchers to find an alternative way to operate the fenton process which convincingly reduces the inherent problems associated with the homogenous fenton process alternatively the heterogeneous fenton process is a useful option the heterogeneous system contained different phases i e the catalyst and target pollutants are in other states the reactions mainly occur on the heterogeneous catalyst surface where adsorption and diffusion processes are occurred 57 this heterogeneous fenton process could be carried out at a wide ph range and enables utilization of the iron used furthermore the efficiency of the process is rendered with several physical fields phenomena as successfully coupled with photo electro microwave fields cavitation ultrasound etc 58 62 some researchers have shown that organic radical r production is from organic substrates r h since the oh radical takes out a hydrogen atom from r h the r radical consequently takes part in the reaction processes as a moderate oxidizing agent 41 63 in the absence of other competitive scavengers for oh or r in the reaction processes the organic compounds are mineralized into co2 and water by the classical fenton reagents i e fe2 and h2o2 furthermore some reports have shown that at neutral ph the generation of oh radical in the fenton reaction is replaced by the formation of ferryl oxo species feiv which is highly selective compared to oh radical eq 2 64 65 2 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe iv o 2 h 2 o 2 2 fenton like process and its modifications although the fenton process was utilized extensively in the wastewater treatment plants however inherently is composed of several shortcomings such as high operational cost limited optimum ph range significant leaching of iron 7 because of that alternative processes over to classical fenton process were explored using different kinds of homo heterogeneous catalysts using the fe3 66 cu2 cu 67 pyrite 68 nano zero valent iron nzvi 69 schorl 70 posnjakite 71 etc these customized systems are collectively named fenton like processes the fenton like reactions are mediated with the fe3 reactions which are demonstrated with the eqs 3 5 3 fe 3 h 2 o 2 feooh 2 h 4 feooh 2 fe 2 ooh 5 fe 3 ooh fe 2 o 2 h similar to the fenton process the modified fenton processes are also differentiated from the hetero homogenous fenton like systems based on the catalyst phase furthermore either one or more than one different physical field phenomenon s is attributed to the fenton like process which enables it to achieve its high efficiency in wastewater treatments some typical examples of fenton like processes attached to various physical fields in terms of both homo heterogeneous fenton like processes are photo fenton like processes 43 72 73 electro fenton like processes 74 76 cavitation fenton like processes 77 79 and microwave fenton like processes 80 81 etc iron impregnated heterogeneous catalysts are used in both fenton and fenton like processes using natural and synthetic zeolites 82 mesoporous materials 83 84 pillared interlayered clays 85 nafion films 86 polymeric resins 87 activated carbon 88 ashes 89 biochar 90 pumice particles 91 aluminates 92 etc which are extensively employed as supporting materials 3 development of nano fenton like catalyst nflc as both hetero homogeneous fenton processes showed several practical drawbacks hence there was a challenge for researchers to develop newer and practically suitable low cost catalysts that can generate oh radical from h2o2 in the fenton like system to attain efficient generation of oh radicals through the transfer of electrons to h2o2 the alternative of classical fenton catalyst need to be modified in such a way that the catalyst is capable of attaining different oxidation states further to prevent the precipitation of the catalytic species both the active inactive form must be stable in a wide range of ph the superior surface properties of the nanoparticles permit significant deviance from those of their bulk equivalents 93 the catalytic performance of nanocatalysts is strongly reliant on the shape size surface structure as well as on bulk compositions 94 95 therefore the role of several nano metallic or nanocomposites based nflc and the importance of supporting materials are discussed extensively also their feasibility and the practical applicability towards various micro pollutants are elaborated in the following sections the mechanism followed by the reaction pathways in the degradation processes is further included to understand the insights of the catalytic cycles 3 1 iron based nflc fe ii fe iii redox couple is the driving force that is responsible for the electron transfer processes in the generation of oh radicals from h2o2 as demonstrated in the eqs 1 5 it was noted that in the classical fenton process a relatively higher amount of iron is required which causes excessive sludge production hence its disposal is an additional environmental burden however nano zero valent iron fe0 has shown innumerable properties and offers efficient fenton like processes with a minimal dose of iron and the sludge production is significantly reduced 96 99 therefore the use of zero valent iron zvi in the fenton type process has received more significant and considerable interest in recent times because of its excellent catalytic processes 100 101 and less environmental load as in the form of sludge moreover the catalyst possessed a high specific surface area to volume ratio which eventually enabled high photocatalytic reactivity having fast kinetics in eliminating quite a lot of micro pollutants from aquatic environments 102 it was mentioned that several pollutants were efficiently remediated by using the nano zero valent iron however the major drawback was reported to be the low mineralization rate of micro pollutants especially antibiotics 103 104 however even a small dose of hydrogen peroxide significantly enhanced the mineralization of micro pollutants 103 further it was pointed that a higher concentration of h2o2 was found hazardous for transportation and handling and expensive in bulk utilization 104 therefore a novel role of edta was explored as it was capable of activating the dioxygen and in situ generations of h2o2 in the fe2 edta system 105 this was known to be the greener reagent in operation 106 107 a novel nzvi h2o2 fenton like system was introduced coupled with acoustic ultrasound effects 108 to remove 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in a line many researchers have explored the suitability and applicability of nzvi fenton like systems 69 109 114 a small sized nzvi 20 nm specific surface area 39 2 m2 g was synthesized by the borohydride reduction process and the material was optimized for the degradation of norfloxacin under the fenton like process adjusting the ph around 3 4 enabled the degradation of norfloxacin ca 95 within 40 min 104 similarly the degradation of 4 chloro 3 methyl phenol 115 nitrobenzene 116 carbothiolate herbicide molinate 117 methyl tert butyl ether 101 were demonstrated elsewhere the nano zero valent iron utilized fenton like process was impacted in the presence of several cations anions hence the presence of cu2 and mg2 was extensively studied in the degradation of amoxicillin 118 the removal percentage was increased with increasing the cu2 concentrations however a reverse trend was obtained in the presence of mg2 the insight studies conducted with xps indicated that the cu2 was reduced to cu0 by the fe0 with nano zero valent iron and formed the bimetallic fe cu system which accelerated the removal of amoxicillin cf fig 3 118 on the other hand mg formed the oxides or hydroxides on the catalyst surface simultaneous removal of edta and 4 chlorophenol was investigated in the ultrasound fenton system using a heterogeneous zerovalent iron catalyst the in situ generations of h2o2 via iron edta reactions were demonstrated and the ferryl edta complex feivo edta was the predominant oxidant identified in the degradation of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp and edta 119 the possible mineralization reactions were shown in eq 6 6 fe iv o edta 4 cp intermediates lmw organic acids co 2 h 2 o lmw low molecular weight the integration of different methods enabled to show of synergistic effects in various aops 120 the nano zero valent iron nzvi catalyzed photo electro fenton like process was introduced to degrade the phenol the impact of various physico chemical parameters viz the effect of ph phenol concentration catalyst dose h2o2 concentration etc were studied the optimized catalyst dose and h2o2 concentration were established to be 0 5 g l and 500 mg l respectively further ph 3 0 was an optimum ph for degradation of phenol which was demonstrated with the fact that the production of ferrous fe2 ion involved via three stages i production of electrical energy using stainless steel as a cathode ii oxidation via two electron transfer and iii leaching of iron ii through photolytic reaction at first in the presence of h2o2 the nano zero valent iron was oxidized eq 6 followed by generation of oh by the fenton process eq 7 and photolytic degradation of pollutants eq 8 ph values 5 0 the ferryl ions feo2 are formed which were comparatively weaker oxidants as well as more selective than oh radicals which slowed down the overall reaction processes eq 9 69 6 fe 0 h 2 o 2 2h fe 2 2h 2 o 7 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe oh 2 oh 8 fe oh 2 hÎ½ fe 2 oh 9 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe iv e g feo 2 h 2 o an interesting study was conducted with the bimetallic additive using the cu nzvi fenton process for the degradation of trichloroethylene it was eventually observed that the bimetallic fenton system cu nzvi proceeded through the following four steps in the oxidative removal of trichloroethylene i nzvi releases fe2 via redox cycle from fe 0 in the presence of cu ii ii fe 0 reduces cu species on the catalyst surface iii generation of oh via oxidation of fe ii by hydrogen peroxide followed by radical induced degradation of trichloroethylene in cu nzvi suspension and iv hydrogen peroxide oxidizes fe 0 from nzvi to fe ii which enables sustained generation of hydroxyl radicals to degrade completely the trichloroethylene 121 similarly the bimetallic cu nzvi was found efficient in the degradation of ciprofloxacin under the weak magnetic field the cu ii species enhanced the leaching of fe ii ions from the surface of nzvi which gave rise to an increase in oh production via reaction with h2o2 additionally the regeneration of nzvi cu was conducted using the tea extracts and employed for multiple operations in the removal of ciprofloxacin 111 though the presence of nanoparticles favored the degradation of potential micro pollutants in the fenton like processes the major disadvantage over using nanoparticles directly was that it keeps the tendency to get agglomerated easily and suppressed the catalytic activity of catalyst hence to overcome the problems researchers tried to stack nanoparticles on the surface of some solid supporting materials a few widely used supporting materials include iron exchanged with nafion membranes 122 thin film 21 123 modified clays 124 125 sand 126 127 etc some other modified materials such as silica fabric 128 carbon shell 129 zeolites 130 resins 131 and cotton 132 were used to immobilize the nzvi on the substrate surface at varied experimental conditions in the elimination of several micro pollutants including the phenol 4 chlorophenol cationic or anionic dyes oxalic acid 2 4 xylidine etc similarly the zero valent iron nanoparticles were impregnated with the bentonite solid and the composite material was employed in the decontamination of phenol the materials were extensively characterized by the tem images which indicated that the nano zero valent iron possessed chain like iron structures however the composite materials showed spherical iron nanoparticles which are dispersed onto the bentonite surface cf fig 4 further the fenton like removal of phenol showed that a maximum of 450 mg g of phenol was removed under suitable experimental conditions additionally the removal pathways of degradation were demonstrated with two steps 110 i adsorption of bpa by the composite material ii fenton like degradation of bpa by the material using the nano zero valent iron bentonite composite nzvi bentonite showed more significant advantages because fewer leachates contained with iron were produced which eventually reduced the load of secondary waste the epr studies demonstrated the reaction mechanism having the reactions eqs 10 14 10 nzvi bentonite fe 2 bentonite 2e 11 nzvi bentonite 2h fe 2 bentonite h 2 12 fe 2 bentonite h 2 o 2 oh oh fe 3 bentonite 13 fe 2 bentonite oh fe 3 bentonite oh 14 h 2 o 2 oh ooh h 2 o the laterite which is enriched with iron was used to obtain the iron nanoparticles fenps utilizing the eucalyptus leaf extracts 133 the iron nanoparticles were contained with fe0 fe2o3 and fe3o4 and had a specific surface area of 36 62 m2 g the fenps catalyzed fenton like process was used for the degradation of ametryn 2 ethylamino 4 isopropylamino 6 methylthio s triazine from an aqueous medium moreover the optimized physico chemical conditions were as 2 125 6 3 5 and 135 min for ph h2o2 cod ratio h2o2 fe ratio and reaction time respectively having the h2o2 dose of 17 and 2 83 mg l of catalyst 112 similarly pirsaheb et al 134 created a novel nanocomposite using nzvi particles encapsulated on carbon dot films and utilized as a nanocatalyst in the fenton like process for the degradation of two widely used antibiotics viz amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin it was stated that encapsulating nzvi particles on biopolymer based carbon dots boosts air water stability and enhances the reactivity of nzvi with h2o2 the role of carbon dots in the process is to safely preserve the nzvi particles against aggregation oxidation and slow discharge in an aqueous medium with time recently another carbon based material biochar supported nzvi catalyzed fenton like process was used for the remediation of antibiotics biochar is microporous that facilitated the impregnation of nzvi efficiently 135 the synthesis of iron based magnetic nanoparticles implanted with the mesoporous carbon based hybrid material fe mesoc was strategically synthesized in a metal organic framework mil 100 fe this novel nano fenton like catalytic system was intended to utilize for the elimination of sulfamethoxazole smx the probable mechanism of the catalyst is shown in fig 5 further the composite materials were successfully recycled for repeated operations 136 in a line the fe based metal organic framework mil 88b fe 137 mil 53 fe 138 mil 100 fe fe3o4 ca mnpcs 139 derived catalysts were obtained and utilized as a fenton like catalyst for the elimination of various organic pollutants from aqueous solutions iron oxides are chemical compounds containing iron and oxygen it occurs on the earth s surface as the mineral magnetite the catalytic performance of nanoparticles of iron iii oxides in the fenton like process in the degradation of ethylene glycol and phenol in the absence of uv irradiation was investigated 140 results indicated that the degradation rate was considerably increased as compared to the photo implemented conventional fenton s process 140 iron oxide nanoparticles supported on the hydroxylated surface of modified diamond nanoparticles were obtained further the visible light assisted heterogeneous catalyst was utilized for the fenton like reaction to remove phenol it was reported that the catalyst s superior catalytic activity was obtained compared to the equivalent carbon based catalysts such as activated carbon graphite or the standard feox tio2 photocatalyst 141 it was noted that the iron based nano fenton like catalyst attracted greater attention in recent times and showed fair catalytic efficiency and reusability in reactor operations however the implications of laboratory scale trials to technology development need further large scale or pilot scale treatment the challenges are ahead with the actual or complex matrix treatment at the large scale treatment moreover the sludge contained with iron is a considerable challenge for recycling such leachates in the cost effective sustainability of the reactor operations furthermore the greener synthesis method devoid of harmful chemicals is the need of the hour however the optimization of reaction for technology development is an additional challenge lying ahead 3 2 copper based nflc similar to the zero valent iron the nano zero valent copper has attracted greater attention recently because of its unique properties and stability in the dispersed medium 142 143 compared to iron 0 44 v fe2 fe copper possesses relatively higher potential 0 34 v cu2 cu vs the normal hydrogen electrode nhe therefore it is not reacting with hydrogen ions h to generate h2 hence helpful in triggering o2 to produce h2o2 0 70 v o2 h2o2 on the catalyst s surface 143 the reactions involved are given in eqs 15 16 144 15 cu h 2 o 2 cu 2 oh oh k 1 0 10 4 m 1 s 1 16 cu 2 h 2 o 2 cu o 2 h oh k 4 6 10 2 m 1 s 1 several studies are conducted utilizing the nano zero valent copper heterogeneous catalyst in the fenton like processes to degrade several micro pollutants from aqueous solutions in the reactor operations the diethyl phthalate dep was completely degraded by the zero valent copper nzvc in 120 min at ph 2 5 the mechanism was investigated and showed that under aerobic atmospheric conditions the possible redox reactions are as follows eqs 17 19 145 17 cu 2 2 e cu 0 e 0 0 340 v 18 cu e cu 0 e 0 0 520 v 19 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 e 0 0 700 v similarly the commercial nanosized zero valent copper nzvc was utilized to degrade norfloxacin nor under the fenton like process and ultrasonic reactor operations the us nzvc h2o2 system greatly favored the nor degradation compared to the conventional fenton process the leaching of cu ions from the nzvc was assumed to be the predominant species which gives rise to activating the h2o2 for producing oh radicals the mechanism of nor degradation due to the different cu species along with h2o2 present in the reaction system was underlined as in eqs 20 27 146 20 cu h 2 o 2 cu 2 o h free o h 21 cu oxidant cu 2 e 22 cu 0 cu o h 1 2 h 2 23 cu 2 h 2 o 2 cu o 2 2 h 24 cu h 2 o 2 cu 2 o h abs o h 25 cu 2 h 2 o 2 cu o 2 2 h 26 cu 2 o 2 cu o 2 27 oh nor intermediates the use of ultrasound in aqueous solutions produces the radical species which provides the synergistic influence in eliminating micropollutants 77 147 the nzvc assisted fenton like process using 20 300 and 520 khz ultrasonic frequency was conducted to degrade phenol further the operating frequency of 300 khz in ultrasound showed a maximum phenol removal per unit power dissipation and the extent of total organic carbon elimination 77 macroporous graphene supported zero valent copper nanoparticles modified 3d structure 3d gn cu0 was obtained by a simple liquid phase reduction process the n2 adsorption desorption curves followed the type iv h3 type hysteresis loop which indicated the mesoporosity of solids cf fig 6 a moreover the formation of macropores 50 nm was characterized by the hysteresis loop of cu0 as it was shifted to p p0 1 0 143 it was further supported with the size distribution as achieved by the nldft method cf fig 6b without adding extra hydrogen peroxide very high efficiency in the degradation of metronidazole mnz was obtained by the novel 3d nanocatalyst in a wide ph range from 3 2 to 9 8 143 approximately 2 33 ppm of cu leached out from the nanocatalyst i e about 2 33 dissolution rate which was considerably less compared to cunps 55 36 ppm and the combination of cu0 and 3d gn 35 72 ppm cf fig 7 the reusability of the catalyst turned out to be worthy as the degradation was above 60 even after the third cycle of mnz degradation three different nano zero valent metals nzvms viz iron fe0 copper cu0 and nickel ni0 are utilized in the ultrasound assisted heterogeneous nano fenton like process in the degradation of nonylphenol each of these nzvms was subjected to reactor operations at neutral ph conditions the ability of various nzvms in the degradation of nonylphenol 6 ppm was found as fe0 cu0 ni0 109 further the nzvc h2o2 system was assessed in the degradation of benzoic acid it was noted that acidic conditions and higher doses of catalyst favored the degradation of benzoic acid greatly moreover the aid of h2o2 accelerates the corrosion of nzvc to release cu ions which eventually generates oh radicals via a fenton like reaction 148 the identification of the major reactive oxidant oh was identified by using an excess amount of isopropyl alcohol as a quencher as its reaction rate constant 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 is very high 149 do et al 150 synthesized a novel yolk like magnetic structured fenton like catalyst which was encapsulated in a silica shell and wrapped with copper nanoparticles in the presence of h2o2 the synthesized cunps decorated fe3o4 sio2 nanocatalyst showed efficient catalytic activity which resulted in the complete elimination of acetaminophen within 60 min of operation at the same time fe3o4 fe3o4 cu and fe3o4 sio2 exhibited 58 8 65 3 67 0 degradation respectively within 120 min of reactor operation cufeo2 nanoplates and nanocubes having different surface manifestations 012 and 110 were synthesized and characterized by the sem tem and hrtem methods and results are shown in fig 8 the cufe 012 nanoplate was found with a width and thickness of about 1 Î¼m and 50 nm having a lattice fringe of 0 251 nm in hr tem fig 8e on the other hand cubic structured cufe 110 has a lattice fringe of 0 152 nm in the hr tem image fig 8f the materials were intended to utilize in the fenton reaction in the degradation of ofloxacin ofx the degradation of ofx by cufeo2 012 was about four times faster than that of cufeo2 110 it was demonstrated that the electron transfer from cufeo2 012 facet result in the suitable oo bond elongation 1 472 Ã¥ i e bond length in h2o2 which leads to the production of reactive oxidant oh radicals whereas in the case of cufeo2 110 oo bond length is stretched from 1 468 Ã¥ to 3 290 Ã¥ which causes the formation of oh ions hence suppressing the degradation of pollutant molecules 151 cu fe3o4 core shell nanoparticles n cu fe3o4 were obtained and employed in pre treated landfill leachate for oxytetracycline otc degradation almost complete removal of 20 ppm otc was obtained within 30 min through the n cu fe3o4 h2o2 fenton like reaction at ph 3 0 the reusability and stability performance of the catalyst showed a gradual decrease in the removal of otc for five consecutive runs as 99 2 92 4 71 3 68 3 and 66 2 respectively 152 utilization of novel magnetic cufe2o4 spinel nanoparticles mediated fenton like oxidation of sulfanilamide was conducted it was reported that the cu ii on the cufe2o4 nanocomposite caused an enhanced degradation of sulfanilamide at around neutral ph conditions a comparative evaluation of the rate constant concerning the different catalytic systems such as cuo 2 60 10 2 l m min cufe2o4 nps 2 58 10 3 l m min fe3o4 1 92 10 3 l m min and Î± fe2o3 7 30 10 4 l m min were concluded that the activation by the h2o2 the reactivity of solid cu ii was efficient than that of fe iii at the neutral ph conditions further the lcms ms studies enabled the 11 degradation products devoid of sulfanilic acid therefore the possible pathway was through the cleavage of the cs bond rather than sn bond cleavage subsequently the mineralization of sulfanilic acid cf scheme fig 9 153 the inert surface of conditioned diamond nanoparticles npd is greatly enabled to generate and diffuse freely oh within the solution and interact feebly with the pollutant molecules 154 further the inert npd surface is helpful as support media for the ag au or even the cu nanoparticles and enhances the suitability of materials in the catalyzed reactions 155 157 in a line a novel fenton like catalyst consists of copper nanoparticles propped up on diamond nanoparticles dnps as synthesized by polyol reduction of cu no3 2 in the presence of dnps and utilized in the degradation of phenol 158 cunps dnps catalyst mediated fenton like system enables an enhanced degradation efficiency than analogous catalytic systems viz cunps activated carbon cunps carbon nanotubes and cunps tio2 p25 the catalyst had relatively less stability and activity upon reuse although it is possible to recover by reducing the catalyst again by the polyol method fenton like elimination of enrofloxacin efn at concentration level Î¼g l was conducted using several nanocatalysts viz copper oxides titanium carbide and silicon nitride nanoparticles the cuo h2o2 and tic h2o2 catalytic systems showed 90 degradation of the efn in 12 h in the presence of sodium halide salts the reaction rate was accelerated in the case of cuo nanoparticles mediated fenton like degradation two possible mechanisms explained this increase in reaction rate i an additional reaction pathway was provided by the salts which contained with the radical species which degrades enf readily and ii otherwise the presence of salts inherently accelerates the non radical mechanism for the degradation of enrofloxacin 159 the catalytic degradation of alachlor and phenanthrene was conducted using the nano sized copper oxide in the presence of h2o2 rapid degradation of these micro pollutants was obtained and the presence of several oxidants or salts inhibited the degradation rate of alachlor however very high concentrations 1 m of nacl favored the reaction rate of degradation significantly 160 several studies intended to assess the unsupported nanoparticles of copper oxide in the oxidative removal of nitrophenols 161 production of h2o2 162 and inactivation of bacteria 163 fenps cunps and fe cu bimetallic nps were employed in three different electro fenton catalytic systems to degrade nafcillin nfc the nfc drug was completely removed by the fe cu bimetallic nps mediated fenton like systems having less electrolysis time than that of fe and cu nps moreover the reusability of fe cu bimetallic nanocatalyst has shown about 77 degradation of the nfc even after three consecutive cycles 164 the use of nano zero valent copper showed a more significant drawback of its bulk particles hence the activity was reduced significantly since the active surface area was reduced for bulk particles 165 166 this suppressed the fenton reaction for degradation of several micro pollutants however the support media enabled to restrict the agglomeration of nanoparticles and enhanced the suitability applicability of materials 167 3 3 gold based nflc the use of gold nanoparticles in catalytic reactions has received greater attention recently since the colloidal or supported gold nanoparticles provide a bridge between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis 168 172 therefore nanoparticles played an important role in converging both the area of research i e the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis the standard reduction potential of gold i e all possible oxidation states of gold is very high 1 2 v because of that it was considered as a passive element for a long at least from a catalytic point of view however the nanoparticles or nanoscale clusters of gold have shown excellent catalytic activity hence paving the way for studying different gold catalyzed reactions 171 173 the excellent results utilizing the gold nanoparticles as fenton catalysts have shown the redox reactions as demonstrated with the au0 and au species eqs 25 26 174 177 25 au 0 h 2 o 2 oh oh au 26 au h 2 o 2 ooh h au 0 the gold nanoparticles supported on different support media viz hydroxyapatite hap fe2o3 tio2 and graphite c were obtained and utilized to remediation of organic pollutants the au hap showed maximum removal efficiency ph 2 5 compared to other catalysts it showed much enhanced catalytic activity than the typical iron ions exchanged zeolite fe zsm 5 catalyst in the fenton like degradation of phenol it was further suggested that the positively charged gold nanoparticles on hap a redox reaction au0 au occurs during the wet peroxidation reactions 178 the gold supported catalyst was utilized to produce in situ h2o2 and the studies were inadequate to demonstrate the formation of oh radicals 171 179 however the gold au decorated fenton treated diamond nanoparticles ho npd named au ho npd are obtained and employed for the elimination of phenol in aqueous solutions 175 the results showed that the catalytic generation of oh radicals is predominantly generated at the surface of au ho npd gold is involved with redox processes and reduction of h2o2 causes the oh the complete scheme is proposed in fig 10 further it was suggested that the hydroxyl radicals are not bound on the surface of the catalyst however they diffused in the solution and enhanced the catalytic degradation of phenol 175 similarly the fenton treated functionalized diamond nanoparticles dnp were utilized in the gene delivery process the dnp possessed extremely small sized nanoparticles 4 nm average size and was contained with enhanced surface oh groups the dnp was enabled to functionalize the thionine and it was observed with the hela cell nuclei moreover the triethylammonium functionalized dnp was electrostatically attracted by a plasmid contained with a green fluorescent protein gene hence it delivered the plasmid to cross the hela cell membrane 180 the raw diamond nanoparticles npd were enabled to generate a high density of surface oh groups in a line this further promoted the high density covalent functionalization of npd the high density of oh was confirmed with the ir 1h nmr and xps results the xps results indicated that the presence of o1s peak appeared at 533 70 ev cf fig 11 the xps spectra of raw npd and the ho npd shown for the o1s peak which was shifted by a factor of 2 2 concerning the co 181 the utilization of a large excess of h2o2 for the degradation of phenol was obtained by about 79 decomposition of h2o2 through the fenton process for the production of oh radicals however the gold supported diamond nanoparticles au dnp catalyst was found inactive at neutral ph and room temperature to enhance the performance of the catalyst at the neutral ph conditions different light energy sources like lamp irradiation 176 sunlight 177 etc were introduced in the studies the catalytic activity of au dnp in the fenton process was demonstrated with the plasmon excitation occurring at the surface of gold bombarding monochromatic light or even solar light therefore the transfer of electrons from gold to hydrogen peroxide eventually enabled to enhance the catalytic degradation process 176 the optimization of various physico chemical parameters viz ph reaction temperature h2o2 dose a pollutant to gold molar ratio etc in the degradation of phenol is carried out in batch reactor operations it was further interesting to note that the toxicity of the substrates was remarkably reduced using the biological treatment coupled with the fenton process named as the tandem process this enabled to decrease in the toc values even with the minimal aid of h2o2 complete detoxification of phenol was achieved at an initial ph of 4 and 50 c having the h2o2 and phenol concentrations of 4 0 and 320 mg l respectively employing the oxygenated conditions further it was observed that no aromatic compounds were detected in the treated samples however the presence of three and four carbon dicarboxylic acids were detected as by products moreover the complete detoxification of phenol was confirmed by the vibrio fischeri test 180 gold nanoparticles associated with the fenton process were done by quintanilla and his coworkers 174 to degrade phenol they anticipated a novel nano fenton like catalyst i e activated carbon supported gold nanoparticles as an efficient alternative for remediation of biologically reluctant chemicals activated carbon being the preferable supporting material compared to tio2 and fe2o3 contributes to its high adsorption capability to enhance the resultant degradation efficiency of the catalyst moreover negligible leaching of gold from the catalytic surface showed the stability and reusable property of the catalyst 174 the monometallic gold au or silver ag nanoparticles along with the bimetallic core shell auag nps were introduced in the fenton treatment for degradation of l leucine 182 the performance of the metal nanocatalysts was examined both with or without h2o2 reaction conditions via degradation of l leucine in aqueous solutions the catalytic activity of auag core shell bimetallic nanoparticles was found more efficient than monometallic au or ag nanoparticles for the degradation of amino acids 182 nine different catalyst samples having supported gold nanoparticles viz activated carbon ac carbon xerogel cx cxl carbon nanotubes cnt graphite gr nano diamond powder ndpw micro diamonds md and silicon carbides sc were synthesized using the two different techniques i e colloidal col process and double impregnation method dim the hrtem images and haadf micrographs of gold nanoparticles on these carbon solids are shown in fig 12 the presence of au nanoparticles were confirmed with the z contrast micrographs whereas the hrtem images showed the presence of gold nanoparticles as darker areas in the images cf fig 12 further the catalytic degradation efficiency of cyclohexane in aqueous solutions was assessed using these samples the performance of the catalyst depends on the size of gold nanoparticles impregnated on the support media the lower sizes generally exhibited better activity as well as the mesoporous property of the solids among all nine au carbon catalysts the au cnt col catalyst was found to be most efficient catalyst in the degradation of cyclohexane the reusability and stability of the materials showed a comparable removal efficiency even at the completion of six successive cycles 183 the use of gold nanoparticles in the fenton process is exceptionally efficient and showed greater viability for its possible implications in the unit operations particularly the advanced treatment processes of refractory pollutants from the wastewaters however gold is a precious metal and its cost depends on the market fluctuations and finds several external economic considerations therefore the issue is its viability and reusability is a significant concern for its possible introduction for ultimate use the challenges lie in the heterogeneous systems to recover and reutilize gold nanoparticles for sustained applicability additionally the support media is a matter of concern for the introduction of gold although the diamond platinum and other precious metals showed greater efficiency the price and associated factors restrained its implications in the wastewater treatment plants however carbonaceous materials viz activated carbon graphene carbon nanotubes or even natural clay or clay based materials etc are found suitable and useful alternatives in technology development 3 4 zinc based nflc like other transition metals zinc possesses the redox behavior having the reduction potential of 0 76 v zn2 zn which is lower than iron 0 44 v fe2 fe hence it readily releases electrons and gets oxidized the nano form of zinc metal or metal oxides have shown the capability of releasing electrons accordingly zinc nanoparticles received greater attention in their possible applications in the fenton processes 184 186 a newer heterojunction nanocatalyst using zinc oxide and iron vanadate fevo4 was synthesized by thermal mixing the tem images showed that the spherical shaped zno particles have ca 25 nm in size whereas the fevo4 have the shape of rods cf fig 13 the zno fevo4 nanocatalyst is introduced to remove sodium dodecyl sulphate sds and a synergistic effect was observed using the uv light assisted fenton like process complete degradation of 40 mg l sds at ph 5 5 and 1 57 ml of h2o2 during 45 min of reaction time was achieved the catalyst showed excellent stability and reusability in repeated reactor operations 187 similarly the different metals co ni mn substituted the sol gel process synthesized zinc ferrite catalysts these catalysts were engaged in the remediation of potential water pollutant 4 chlorophenol 186 188 189 various physico chemical parametric studies were performed using different compositions of both the trimetallic catalysts under neutral conditions and observed that the substitution of zinc significantly enhanced the activity of the catalyst compared to the ferrite catalyst moreover interesting to observe that a direct correlation was obtained between the amount of catalyst and the extent of degradation of 4 chlorophenol which inferred that the fenton reactions take place on the surface of the catalyst further negligible leaching of iron provides exceptional stability and reusability than other higher iron containing catalysts and owns the capability for its further implications in the refining of aquatic environments contaminated with probable micro pollutants znfe2o4 nanoparticles zfnps were synthesized by the co precipitation process and utilized as a heterogeneous photo electro fenton like catalyst in the degradation of benzotriazole bta from aqueous solutions the zfnps nanocatalyst exhibited relatively high catalytic efficiency and ca 91 2 of bta was degraded using uv light irradiation at an optimum ph of 3 for 3 h of reactor operations the bta elimination was increased due to enormous production of oh radicals eqs 27 and 28 when the applied negative potential was increased from 0 3 to 0 6 v in the photo electro fenton like process 27 o 2 2h 2e h 2 o 2 28 h 2 o 2 hv 2 oh further increase in applied potential gave a negative effect due to the possible side reactions eqs 29 and 30 in the degradation of the pollutant hence 0 6 v was an optimum potential for the efficient removal of bta 190 29 o 2 4h 4e 6h 2 o 30 h 2 o 2 2h 2e 2h 2 o yolk shell having the chemical formula of znfe2o4 has numerous active sites that enable it for a wide range of applications including electrocatalysis sensors catalysis or even the fenton processes etc 191 194 the solvothermal process synthesized the yolk shell znfe2o4 nanoparticles advanced analytical tools characterized the catalyst the tem images of the znfe2o4 10 showed a unique yolk shell structure having the lattice spacing of 0 25 nm which is ascribed to the 3 1 1 crystal planes of znfe2o4 jcpds no 22 1012 cf fig 14 a b the yolk shell consists of small particles having a polycrystalline structure fig 14 c d further the elemental mapping fig 14 f h showed uniform distribution of zn fe and o elements within the solid the yolk shell was employed as a nano fenton like catalyst for visible light supported fenton like process in the remediation of tetracycline tc 194 the result indicated that compared to the raw znfe2o4 or Î± fe2o3 catalysts the catalytic activity of znfe2o4 10 nanocatalyst is much higher at least in the degradation of tc the nanocatalyst was stable in the fenton process and showed comparable removal efficiency for tc at a wide ph range based on the experimental findings the reaction mechanisms were demonstrated with eqs 31 39 194 31 znfe 2 o 4 vis znfe 2 o 4 e h 32 h 2 o 2 e oh oh 33 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh 34 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 ooh h 35 fe 2 ooh

materials having different weight ratios of zn were synthesized and employed in the fenton like degradation of 4 nitrophenol among all the different compositions of the nanocomposites the degradation efficiency was followed by the order z 90 g 10 z 90 c 10 z 70 g 30 z 70 c 30 further combined ultrasound and light coupled fenton like process showed a synergistic effect in the degradation of 4 nitrophenol 195 metal organic framework mof is the designed porous materials and showed a wide range of applications in storage catalysis separation water treatment etc 196 199 the mof has also shown suitability in the photo fenton like processes therefore the mesoporous mil 100 fe doped with zno nanosphere was obtained and employed in the photo fenton like degradation of three important water micro pollutants viz phenol bisphenol a and atrazine since the mesoporous mil 100 fe showed higher catalytic efficiency than microporous mil 100 fe the decoration of zno on the mof surface showed remarkably superior photo fenton catalytic activity visible light radiation along with h2o2 provides enhanced production of oh radicals that act in oxidizing the target pollutants the mesoporous mil 100 fe provides open pore cavities that allow all the external and internal surfaces to get attached to the reactants during the reaction process on the other hand the zno nanospheres effectively inhibit the recombination of excited e h pairs 200 3 5 manganese based nflc transition metal exchanged ferrites viz mxfe3 xo4 m mn co ni or cu has received much attention in the recent past to overcome the difficulties associated with the iron based fenton processes 201 204 therefore the use of mn in the iron exchanged solids attracted attention in developing heterogeneous catalysts these heterogeneous catalysts are employed efficiently in a variety of photocatalytic fenton like processes the mn3o4 as written as mno mn2o3 having spinel type structure is a useful heterogeneous catalyst enhancing the catalytic activity employed in the heterogeneous catalyst 205 206 the suitability of mn in the fenton process is due to the redox cycle of mn ii and mn iii e0 mn3 mn2 1 51 v which is considerably greater than that of fe ii 0 44 v fe2 fe therefore a novel heterogeneous nanocomposite based fenton like catalyst was designed using the nanocrystalline mn3o4 inside mesoporous sba 15 silica mn3o4 sba 15 the use of catalyst enabled the degradation of the ethanol 100 ppm in the presence of h2o2 in an aqueous solution 207 concerning the catalytic activity the maximum catalytic activity was achieved at ph 6 7 at an optimum temperature of 343 k moreover the degradation ability of the nanocomposite composed of mn nanocrystals on sba 15 was 20 times higher than that of commercially available mn3o4 under identical reaction environments further the reaction rate was dependent on the content of intermediate radicals formed i e oh o2 and ho2 which was formed with the decomposition of h2o2 207 spinel manganese ferrite mnfe2o4 nanoparticles were obtained by the co precipitation method and employed in the fenton like degradation of 4 chlorophenol the presence of h2o2 enabled the hydroxyl radicals by the transition of fe2 to fe3 and mn2 to mn3 the studies optimized the physico chemical parameters using the fitted model which inferred the solution ph peroxide concentration and catalyst dosage were 4 24 0 07 mol l and 0 72 g l respectively further for the 23 11 mg l of 4 chlorophenol concentration at 61 min of reaction time the maximum 93 degradation was achieved 208 similarly mnfe2o4 sio2 nanocomposite was synthesized using the nano casting method employing mesoporous silica gel as a templating material compared to the silica template the prepared nanocomposite showed a decrease in specific bet surface area and pore volume from 340 m2 g 0 89 cm3 g to 222 m2 g 0 52 cm3 g respectively the nanocomposite possessed a high activity in the complete decomposition of 3 mol l h2o2 as achieved in 5 min the nanocomposite was examined only towards the decomposition of h2o2 hence no specific reaction mechanism was proposed ensuring the fenton chemistry 209 wan et al 210 investigated the reaction mechanism and kinetics of sulfamethazine smt degradation with a novel fe3o4 mn3o4 nanocomposite catalyzed heterogeneous fenton like system the presence of mn3o4 in the nanocomposite materials enhanced the catalytic efficiency in smt degradation via leaching of mn3 which subsequently reduced to mn2 by fe2 since the reduction potential of both the metals are e0 mn3 mn2 1 51 v e0 fe3 fe2 0 771 v respectively eqs 40 and 41 also shown the schematic in fig 15 40 mn 3 fe 2 mn 2 fe 3 41 mn 2 h 2 o 2 mn 3 h 2 o oh the reusability of catalyst was evaluated employed for five successive operations under similar experimental conditions the percentage degradation was gradually decreased from 94 to 60 at the end of the fifth cycle of operation similarly manganese dioxide mno2 is a common constituent of soils and sediments it possessed low environmental toxicity and had unique physicochemical properties viz dynamic redox potential large surface area and various oxidation states 211 it was also reported that manganese dioxide readily agglomerated due to the strong attractive van der waals forces this led to the reduced surface area hence limiting its catalytic activity 212 immobilized or doped manganese dioxide nanoparticles with suitable porous materials provided excellent properties and significantly restricted the nanoparticles agglomeration therefore the hierarchical manganese dioxide biochar mno2 bcs nanocomposite was obtained by the hydrothermal method 213 and utilized for the remediation of bisphenol a bpa in an ultrasound assisted fenton like system the sem tem morphological studies showed that the mno2 nanoparticles were impregnated on the surface of biochar with two different morphologies i flower like Î´ mno2 and ii urchin like Î± mno2 further the urchin like Î± mno2 bcs nanocomposite showed much enhanced degradation efficiency for bpa in the fenton like system at the bpa initial concentration of 100 Î¼m bpa within 20 min at neutral ph condition the synergistic effect was observed using ultrasonication 20 khz further the peroxymonosulfate activated catalyst mn doped bifeo3 nanoparticles were used to efficiently degrade bisphenol a 214 it is known that so4 radical is a strong oxidizing agent having redox potential of so4 2 5 to 3 1 v the bimetallic catalyst i e mn and fe ions in the mn doped bfo is activated greatly in presence of peroxymonosulfate via so4 radicals which led to the complete degradation of bisphenol a in 15 min of visible light irradiation similarly the peroxymonosulfate activated mn fe2o3 graphene hybrid material was utilized for the elimination of organic pollutants 215 the reaction rate was found much higher than that of other processes including degradation by bfo with h2o2 or peroxymonosulfate the presence of four times co existing ions viz kbro3 na2co3 nacl and nano3 showed a positive effect in the presence of kbro3 and nano3 this was due to the formation of stronger reactive radicals species no3 and bro2 than so4 which promoted the oxidation of organic pollutants however the presence of na2co3 and nacl hindered the oxidation of bpa due to the formation of so4 quencher 3 6 palladium based nflc the standard redox potential of palladium is 0 95 v vs she standard hydrogen electrode which is much higher than that of the redox potential of iron hence the palladium element is helpful for its possible implications in the fenton like process however the literature review reveals that only scanty studies were conducted using the pd in the fenton like processes 216 218 one of the reasons is that the element is precious and expensive and it needs a suitable support media to disperse the palladium nanoparticles 219 however it was reported that the palladium is present in the membrane and intracellular e faecalis where it plays a vital role in electron transfer or catalytic actions of several biological functions 220 therefore the use of bio pd in the synthesis of catalysts enables to reduction of the cost of the catalyst in a line the bio derived pd was utilized to synthesize novel bio pd fe fe2o3 nanoparticles and the catalyst was employed for the fenton like degradation of sodium diclofenac 219 the enterococcus faecalis e faecalis bacteria were used as a source of pd the bio pd fe fe3o4 nps were found to be circular shaped having an average size of 9 nm the optimized percentage degradation of diclofenac 10 ppm in 20 min and 40 min was achieved as 94 69 and 99 65 respectively various parametric studies in the removal of diclofenac are shown in fig 16 the dissimilar metal corrosion of nzvi by the pd fe oxidation reduction reaction gives rise to the leaching of iron ii ions into the solutions eventually takes part in the production of oh radicals as a result of that a high reaction rate in the fenton like degradation of diclofenac was accomplished it was further mentioned that the dechlorination and oh radical generation was due to the production of active hydrogen which later initiated the ring opening reaction followed by gradual mineralization of diclofenac 221 223 the bimetallic nanocatalyst fe3o4 pd was synthesized and applied in the electrochemical process combined with fenton like degradation to remove pentachlorophenol pcp complete degradation of pcp was reached in 30 min of reactor operation using the fe3o4 pd nanocatalyst at the optimized physico chemical conditions as ph 2 3 temperature 288 k and electric field 5 v the mechanism of fe leaching is driven by the presence of pd nanoparticles present on the surface of fe3o4 the reusability tests of the catalyst showed that a significant decrease in catalyst performance was observed with repeated use of a catalyst 224 pd was loaded with the magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles pd mnps and the catalyst was employed in the electro fenton like degradation of phenol from aqueous solutions 225 the novel electrocatalytic system showed around 98 degradation of 20 ppm phenol within an hour at ph 3 the rate of the fenton degradation of phenol was increased by increasing the pd loading an applied electric field and it was decreased by increasing the initial concentration of phenol cf fig 17 the in situ production of h2o2 was attained from the electrochemical reaction between anodic o2 and cathodic h2 a novel green and one pot synthesis were conducted to obtain the core shell fe3o4 coated pd nanoparticles hybrid material pd fe3o4 mofs further hollow fe mofs were introduced to engross hybrid material to get the yolk shell structured composite yolk shell pd fe3o4 mofs which was relatively stable and prevented the aggregation of pd this was then utilized in the fenton like remediation of phenols and chlorophenols the transfer of electrons from pd to fe3o4 assisted the fe iii fe ii redox cycle which enabled the generation of oh through continuous decomposition of h2o2 a high value of mineralization of these pollutants was achieved by maintaining a low h2o2 pollutant molar ratio the catalyst was utilized to treat tannery wastewater and found that despite the presence of many co existing ions the yolk shell pd fe3o4 mofs still exhibited exceptional catalytic activity 226 similarly the fe metal organic framework derived core shell fe pd c nanocatalyst is obtained and employed in the electro fenton like reaction to degrade phenol the modified fe pd c nanocatalyst enabled the continuous discharge of fe2 ions through dissimilar metal corrosion of fe0 anode which subsequently initiated the decomposition of h2o2 and produced readily the oh this enabled an efficient 95 mineralization of phenol within 10 min at ph ca 5 6 it was further noted that negligible leaching of iron was observed hence the fe pd c catalyst remained stable in the fenton process in contrast to commercial fe c material the modified fe pd c nanocomposite showed significantly enhanced catalytic efficiency better stability and prolonged reactor operations 227 further table 1 included a summary of various nflcs utilized in different forms of fenton like processes for the degradation of a variety of organic micro pollutants 4 conclusion and future perspectives the fenton like process is bridging the homogeneous to the heterogeneous chemistry of catalysts the heterogeneous fenton like process is useful for the decontamination of aquatic environments from recalcitrant micropollutants the process tunes the existing wastewater treatment technology to remove the persistent micro pollutants and provides a safe and viable treatment technology the fenton like reaction using the nzvi is a nice alternative in the treatment process it overcomes several disadvantages of the classical fenton process including the enormous amount of sludge formation and its disposal operating low ph conditions and selectivity of contaminants in water bodies further the use of bimetallic composed of transition metal or metal oxide nanoparticles and the nano zero valent iron in the fenton like processes has attracted greater attention since it provides enhanced catalytic action with synergistic effects this eventually minimizes the dose of hydrogen peroxide in the reactor operations additionally the nanoparticles of the noble metals viz ag au pt etc are practical alternatives that synergize the fenton process in a line the support media is essential in the catalytic action of these nanomaterials in the fenton like process the use of mesoporous materials including the carbon nanotubes graphene oxide reduced graphene clay materials etc are useful alternatives providing the high specific surface area for impregnation or doping of the nanomaterials nanoparticles which eventually enhances the reaction processes with a reduced agglomeration of nanoparticles also reduces the corrosion of catalyst in the reaction mixture these novel systems have provided innumerable advantages in the fenton like methods for treating several micro pollutants from aqueous solutions the fenton process is although several advantages and is relatively cost effective and greener however the challenges remain in the widespread application in technology development or scaling up the technology the fenton like process is primarily based on the oh radical generation using iron and hydrogen peroxide hence the treatment method is not selective the selectivity using the advanced nanomaterials or the nanocomposites are viable alternatives hence extensive studies are to be carried out controlling nanoparticle dispersion and agglomeration to obtain a nanomaterial with innovative physical and chemical properties for near future technological implications is a research area to study extensively further the majority of fenton research is conducted in laboratories and has limited commercial applications the natural matrix treatment is entirely different from the laboratory experimentation since the actual wastewater samples are composed of complex matrices which significantly hampers the treatment method therefore trials with actual matrix samples are required in the large scale treatment to scale up the process similarly the use of heterogeneous catalysts using the nanomaterials nanocomposites has less stability reactivity in the successive reactor operations which significantly restricted the reuse of catalysts in sustainable operations moreover the instability causes increased corrosion and creates an extra load to the environment for its discharge or disposal the use of natural biopolymers and plant extracts is to be exploited to synthesize nanoparticles or nanocomposites which may provide a greener route of catalyst synthesis the utilization of bio recovered metals and supporting materials for the synthesis of nanocatalyst or nanocomposites is not acquired enough attention which practically helps maintain the cost of the treatment process for the degradation micro pollutants moreover the in situ generation of h2o2 is attractive and needs enhanced attention for its widespread use the amalgamation of different physical fields phenomena can synergize the catalytic efficiency selectivity with enhanced reaction rate perhaps needs greater attention in fenton like processes credit authorship contribution statement prof diwakar tiwari major drafting of the review

13201,nanomaterials mediated fenton like processes have received global interest because of their unique and efficient degradation efficacy towards potential micro pollutants in aquatic environments the fenton like approach is relatively promising greener and interestingly the micro pollutants are degraded to their end products efficiently the conventional fenton like methods are concomitant with several limitations including the high operational costs risk possibility in handling and the significant leaching of iron that causes indirect contamination the advanced and newer nanocomposite materials have shown unique and advanced technological inputs in the development and optimized use of fenton like processes therefore this communication s inherent objective is to critically review critically the role of various nanocomposite catalysts in the fenton like process further the review extensively demonstrated the critical aspects of homogeneous chemistry to heterogeneous chemistry using nanomaterials and nanoparticles to degrade a wide range of emerging micro pollutants the critical parameters viz the support media light energy ultrasound which significantly affect the efficiency of fenton like processes are extensively demonstrated in the review for greater implacability of study moreover the challenges and commercial implications are outlined and discussed for possible future perspectives keywords micro pollutants fenton like process insights of mechanism bimetallic nanocomposites 1 introduction polluting the water bodies by a range of micro pollutants is becoming a severe ecological concern requiring urgent monitoring and implementation of proper and adequate remediation plans for its agreeable solutions the primary problem is the unfettered discharge of wastewaters ww from a variety of industries along with the agricultural runoffs contained with several herbicides pesticides into the receiving water bodies and led to the widespread contamination of aquatic environments a wide range of organic contaminants viz pharmaceuticals personal care products pcps endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs dyes nitrogen containing compounds halogenated aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons agrochemicals etc are readily detected in measurable quantity in the water bodies and posing a serious threat to the ecological system 1 6 the advanced treatment technologies including membrane filtration wet chemical oxidation biodegradation flocculation adsorption precipitation reduction reverse osmosis etc are proposed to eliminate emerging water contaminants from aqueous wastes however these methods are sometimes inadequate to eliminate the recalcitrant and emerging pollutants from aqueous solutions or found exceedingly expensive for possible implications additionally expensive equipment high operating costs and high maintenance limited these methods utilization further 7 moreover the environmentally sustainable remediation process is demonstrated with low energy consumption 8 less harmful byproducts that are greatly preferred therefore the researchers propose newer and advanced methods for the efficient treatment of potential recalcitrant that need to be reviewed for greater understanding among numerous treatment technologies advanced oxidation processes aops are utilized as an innovative method for efficient and enhanced degradation of recalcitrant micropollutants the process is simply based on the in situ hydroxyl radicals oh generation the hydroxyl radicals hence provide enhanced oxidation ability standard potential 2 80 v vs she as well as high rate constants for bimolecular reactions 108 1011 m 1 s 1 and non selective reactivity 9 11 it is interesting to note that the oh radical either oxidize the complex organic molecules to smaller by products or degrade completely to their end product to carbon dioxide co2 and water h2o i e the mineralization of organic molecules 12 15 in a line a variety of techniques are employed under aops viz fenton iron ii h2o2 16 photo fenton iron ii h2o2 uv ozonization o3 17 h2o2 o3 18 h2o2 uv 19 hetero homogeneous fenton like processes tio2 uv 20 au nps tio2 21 zno uv 22 also supplemented with the light 23 microwave electrical energy cavitation field etc 24 25 these aops are used with different reagents to produce the radical species e g oh ooh the aops are employed alone or it is made a hybrid system in which it is combined with other biological methods subject to the physical chemical properties of the wastewater runoff and as per the requirement of the target contaminants in wastewaters 26 the hybrid processes are composed of the initial degradation of organic molecules into the intractable organic contaminants to decomposable intermediates or by products by the aop process which is then removed by different biological post treatments likewise microbiological processes are set up as pre treatment steps followed by the residual organic segments from effluents that are subsequently removed using the aops 26 the latter process is an important pathway that involves minute quenching of reactive oxidizing radicals by the biodegradable species resulting in improved efficiency of aops and fewer expenses for the post treatment by attributing a variety of techniques and the highly efficient production of radical oxidizing species aops are widely used for groundwater and wastewater treatments 27 28 soil and sediments remediation 29 municipal sludge processing 30 or even degradation of volatile organic wastes 31 the application of nanomaterials has received greater attention worldwide and nanotechnology is quite promising in the efficient treatment of waster waters contaminated with a variety of water contaminants nanomaterials have physical dimensions ranging from 1 to 100 nm these materials compact size enabled them to have a large specific surface area and a high surface area to volume ratio which provides them several exceptional properties useful for environmental studies 32 these materials possessed strong reactivity selective affinity fast kinetics and catalytic potential which make them functional alternative materials 33 nanosorbents 34 nanocatalysts 35 bioactive nanoparticles nanostructured catalytic membranes nanomembranes and nanoparticles 36 are possibly useful to address several global water pollution problems hence the nanostructured materials are excellent new solutions for the treatment of wastewater that can enhance the elimination efficiency towards the potential organic contaminants from water bodies 37 38 the classical fenton reagents iron and hydrogen peroxide are usually investigated to degrade the hazardous organic pollutants from wastewaters or industrial effluents however despite using a large amount of iron in the classical fenton process the use of eco friendly earth abundant iron based or other less toxic metal based catalysts has received greater attention in the recent past to replace the classical fenton process the use of nanomaterials in the fenton process is a cost effective quick efficient and innovative technique some of the standard reviews 39 47 appeared addressing various aspects of the fenton fenton like processes kumar et al 45 mainly focused on eliminating pharmaceutical pollutants utilizing nanocatalysts in fenton electro fenton sono fenton photo fenton and photo electro fenton processes similarly another review discussed alternative non iron fenton catalysts and their hydrogen peroxide activation reactivity 46 li et al 47 summarise current developments in the knowledge and implementation of cu based fenton processes for the treatment of industrial wastewater the other reviews and books demonstrated the different elements of fenton reaction chemistry devoid of critical evaluation of nanomaterials based fenton like processes in the remediation of water contaminated with various micro pollutants however the present review greatly covers the recent advances in the nano catalytic fenton like systems and attempts to critically review the developments in the area further the review focuses on nano materials role in the fenton like reactions and insights of chemistry involved in such processes many researchers tried to introduce different metal nano particles in place of iron subsequently different nano materials are tried to incorporate several eco friendly supporting materials to obtain the nanocomposite or nano fenton like catalyst nflc however nanoparticles or nanocomposites mediated hetero homo fenton and fenton like reaction chemistry are needed to be studied extensively and insights need to be discussed in depth and length which is yet to be explored 39 40 42 44 46 therefore the present review focused on various metal nanocomposites utilized to decompose a variety of potential micropollutants in the fenton like reactions and a detailed study on their redox chemistry is critically evaluated with different practical advantages followed by the future scope of research 2 classical fenton fenton like modified fenton like processes 2 1 classical fenton process and its modifications the classical fenton reaction is carried out with ferrous fe2 ions and peroxides usually h2o2 to generate reactive oxygen species ros that oxidizes both the organic as well as inorganic compounds the fenton reaction was first introduced in 1894 by h j h fenton where he studied the redox reactions involved in the oxidation of tartaric acid 48 many researchers studied the mechanism of the reaction and it was described most commonly as eq 1 fig 1 40 49 51 1 fe 2 h 2 o 2 h fe 3 h 2 o oh various physico chemical parameters viz ph the dose of fenton reagent and initial organic pollutant concentrations are the driving force carrying the fenton process however a critical parameter is the solution ph of the treatment 44 in aqueous solutions although iron ii species remained with the soluble state even at neutral ph conditions however the iron iii species starts forming hydroxo species at ph 4 and thereby the efficiency of the fenton process diminishes 52 the speciation diagram of iron shows that ph 2 8 to 3 2 is the optimum ph range for the fenton process fig 2 46 some other researchers also showed that the ph range of 2 to 4 could provide an optimum treatment efficiency in the fenton process 53 56 since wastewater samples are not found within this ph range to attain the optimal ph range of the fenton process a high amount of acid is added to adjust the ph of wastewater samples prior to operating the fenton process hence this significantly increases the overall treatment cost depending on the catalysts used the fenton process was categorized into two types homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton processes in the homogeneous process whole reacting species are in the same phase i e liquid phase but homogeneous fenton reactions have a few disadvantages like it requires a relatively higher iron dose 50 80 ppm with a limited ph range to carry out the process 41 this led the researchers to find an alternative way to operate the fenton process which convincingly reduces the inherent problems associated with the homogenous fenton process alternatively the heterogeneous fenton process is a useful option the heterogeneous system contained different phases i e the catalyst and target pollutants are in other states the reactions mainly occur on the heterogeneous catalyst surface where adsorption and diffusion processes are occurred 57 this heterogeneous fenton process could be carried out at a wide ph range and enables utilization of the iron used furthermore the efficiency of the process is rendered with several physical fields phenomena as successfully coupled with photo electro microwave fields cavitation ultrasound etc 58 62 some researchers have shown that organic radical r production is from organic substrates r h since the oh radical takes out a hydrogen atom from r h the r radical consequently takes part in the reaction processes as a moderate oxidizing agent 41 63 in the absence of other competitive scavengers for oh or r in the reaction processes the organic compounds are mineralized into co2 and water by the classical fenton reagents i e fe2 and h2o2 furthermore some reports have shown that at neutral ph the generation of oh radical in the fenton reaction is replaced by the formation of ferryl oxo species feiv which is highly selective compared to oh radical eq 2 64 65 2 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe iv o 2 h 2 o 2 2 fenton like process and its modifications although the fenton process was utilized extensively in the wastewater treatment plants however inherently is composed of several shortcomings such as high operational cost limited optimum ph range significant leaching of iron 7 because of that alternative processes over to classical fenton process were explored using different kinds of homo heterogeneous catalysts using the fe3 66 cu2 cu 67 pyrite 68 nano zero valent iron nzvi 69 schorl 70 posnjakite 71 etc these customized systems are collectively named fenton like processes the fenton like reactions are mediated with the fe3 reactions which are demonstrated with the eqs 3 5 3 fe 3 h 2 o 2 feooh 2 h 4 feooh 2 fe 2 ooh 5 fe 3 ooh fe 2 o 2 h similar to the fenton process the modified fenton processes are also differentiated from the hetero homogenous fenton like systems based on the catalyst phase furthermore either one or more than one different physical field phenomenon s is attributed to the fenton like process which enables it to achieve its high efficiency in wastewater treatments some typical examples of fenton like processes attached to various physical fields in terms of both homo heterogeneous fenton like processes are photo fenton like processes 43 72 73 electro fenton like processes 74 76 cavitation fenton like processes 77 79 and microwave fenton like processes 80 81 etc iron impregnated heterogeneous catalysts are used in both fenton and fenton like processes using natural and synthetic zeolites 82 mesoporous materials 83 84 pillared interlayered clays 85 nafion films 86 polymeric resins 87 activated carbon 88 ashes 89 biochar 90 pumice particles 91 aluminates 92 etc which are extensively employed as supporting materials 3 development of nano fenton like catalyst nflc as both hetero homogeneous fenton processes showed several practical drawbacks hence there was a challenge for researchers to develop newer and practically suitable low cost catalysts that can generate oh radical from h2o2 in the fenton like system to attain efficient generation of oh radicals through the transfer of electrons to h2o2 the alternative of classical fenton catalyst need to be modified in such a way that the catalyst is capable of attaining different oxidation states further to prevent the precipitation of the catalytic species both the active inactive form must be stable in a wide range of ph the superior surface properties of the nanoparticles permit significant deviance from those of their bulk equivalents 93 the catalytic performance of nanocatalysts is strongly reliant on the shape size surface structure as well as on bulk compositions 94 95 therefore the role of several nano metallic or nanocomposites based nflc and the importance of supporting materials are discussed extensively also their feasibility and the practical applicability towards various micro pollutants are elaborated in the following sections the mechanism followed by the reaction pathways in the degradation processes is further included to understand the insights of the catalytic cycles 3 1 iron based nflc fe ii fe iii redox couple is the driving force that is responsible for the electron transfer processes in the generation of oh radicals from h2o2 as demonstrated in the eqs 1 5 it was noted that in the classical fenton process a relatively higher amount of iron is required which causes excessive sludge production hence its disposal is an additional environmental burden however nano zero valent iron fe0 has shown innumerable properties and offers efficient fenton like processes with a minimal dose of iron and the sludge production is significantly reduced 96 99 therefore the use of zero valent iron zvi in the fenton type process has received more significant and considerable interest in recent times because of its excellent catalytic processes 100 101 and less environmental load as in the form of sludge moreover the catalyst possessed a high specific surface area to volume ratio which eventually enabled high photocatalytic reactivity having fast kinetics in eliminating quite a lot of micro pollutants from aquatic environments 102 it was mentioned that several pollutants were efficiently remediated by using the nano zero valent iron however the major drawback was reported to be the low mineralization rate of micro pollutants especially antibiotics 103 104 however even a small dose of hydrogen peroxide significantly enhanced the mineralization of micro pollutants 103 further it was pointed that a higher concentration of h2o2 was found hazardous for transportation and handling and expensive in bulk utilization 104 therefore a novel role of edta was explored as it was capable of activating the dioxygen and in situ generations of h2o2 in the fe2 edta system 105 this was known to be the greener reagent in operation 106 107 a novel nzvi h2o2 fenton like system was introduced coupled with acoustic ultrasound effects 108 to remove 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in a line many researchers have explored the suitability and applicability of nzvi fenton like systems 69 109 114 a small sized nzvi 20 nm specific surface area 39 2 m2 g was synthesized by the borohydride reduction process and the material was optimized for the degradation of norfloxacin under the fenton like process adjusting the ph around 3 4 enabled the degradation of norfloxacin ca 95 within 40 min 104 similarly the degradation of 4 chloro 3 methyl phenol 115 nitrobenzene 116 carbothiolate herbicide molinate 117 methyl tert butyl ether 101 were demonstrated elsewhere the nano zero valent iron utilized fenton like process was impacted in the presence of several cations anions hence the presence of cu2 and mg2 was extensively studied in the degradation of amoxicillin 118 the removal percentage was increased with increasing the cu2 concentrations however a reverse trend was obtained in the presence of mg2 the insight studies conducted with xps indicated that the cu2 was reduced to cu0 by the fe0 with nano zero valent iron and formed the bimetallic fe cu system which accelerated the removal of amoxicillin cf fig 3 118 on the other hand mg formed the oxides or hydroxides on the catalyst surface simultaneous removal of edta and 4 chlorophenol was investigated in the ultrasound fenton system using a heterogeneous zerovalent iron catalyst the in situ generations of h2o2 via iron edta reactions were demonstrated and the ferryl edta complex feivo edta was the predominant oxidant identified in the degradation of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp and edta 119 the possible mineralization reactions were shown in eq 6 6 fe iv o edta 4 cp intermediates lmw organic acids co 2 h 2 o lmw low molecular weight the integration of different methods enabled to show of synergistic effects in various aops 120 the nano zero valent iron nzvi catalyzed photo electro fenton like process was introduced to degrade the phenol the impact of various physico chemical parameters viz the effect of ph phenol concentration catalyst dose h2o2 concentration etc were studied the optimized catalyst dose and h2o2 concentration were established to be 0 5 g l and 500 mg l respectively further ph 3 0 was an optimum ph for degradation of phenol which was demonstrated with the fact that the production of ferrous fe2 ion involved via three stages i production of electrical energy using stainless steel as a cathode ii oxidation via two electron transfer and iii leaching of iron ii through photolytic reaction at first in the presence of h2o2 the nano zero valent iron was oxidized eq 6 followed by generation of oh by the fenton process eq 7 and photolytic degradation of pollutants eq 8 ph values 5 0 the ferryl ions feo2 are formed which were comparatively weaker oxidants as well as more selective than oh radicals which slowed down the overall reaction processes eq 9 69 6 fe 0 h 2 o 2 2h fe 2 2h 2 o 7 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe oh 2 oh 8 fe oh 2 hÎ½ fe 2 oh 9 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe iv e g feo 2 h 2 o an interesting study was conducted with the bimetallic additive using the cu nzvi fenton process for the degradation of trichloroethylene it was eventually observed that the bimetallic fenton system cu nzvi proceeded through the following four steps in the oxidative removal of trichloroethylene i nzvi releases fe2 via redox cycle from fe 0 in the presence of cu ii ii fe 0 reduces cu species on the catalyst surface iii generation of oh via oxidation of fe ii by hydrogen peroxide followed by radical induced degradation of trichloroethylene in cu nzvi suspension and iv hydrogen peroxide oxidizes fe 0 from nzvi to fe ii which enables sustained generation of hydroxyl radicals to degrade completely the trichloroethylene 121 similarly the bimetallic cu nzvi was found efficient in the degradation of ciprofloxacin under the weak magnetic field the cu ii species enhanced the leaching of fe ii ions from the surface of nzvi which gave rise to an increase in oh production via reaction with h2o2 additionally the regeneration of nzvi cu was conducted using the tea extracts and employed for multiple operations in the removal of ciprofloxacin 111 though the presence of nanoparticles favored the degradation of potential micro pollutants in the fenton like processes the major disadvantage over using nanoparticles directly was that it keeps the tendency to get agglomerated easily and suppressed the catalytic activity of catalyst hence to overcome the problems researchers tried to stack nanoparticles on the surface of some solid supporting materials a few widely used supporting materials include iron exchanged with nafion membranes 122 thin film 21 123 modified clays 124 125 sand 126 127 etc some other modified materials such as silica fabric 128 carbon shell 129 zeolites 130 resins 131 and cotton 132 were used to immobilize the nzvi on the substrate surface at varied experimental conditions in the elimination of several micro pollutants including the phenol 4 chlorophenol cationic or anionic dyes oxalic acid 2 4 xylidine etc similarly the zero valent iron nanoparticles were impregnated with the bentonite solid and the composite material was employed in the decontamination of phenol the materials were extensively characterized by the tem images which indicated that the nano zero valent iron possessed chain like iron structures however the composite materials showed spherical iron nanoparticles which are dispersed onto the bentonite surface cf fig 4 further the fenton like removal of phenol showed that a maximum of 450 mg g of phenol was removed under suitable experimental conditions additionally the removal pathways of degradation were demonstrated with two steps 110 i adsorption of bpa by the composite material ii fenton like degradation of bpa by the material using the nano zero valent iron bentonite composite nzvi bentonite showed more significant advantages because fewer leachates contained with iron were produced which eventually reduced the load of secondary waste the epr studies demonstrated the reaction mechanism having the reactions eqs 10 14 10 nzvi bentonite fe 2 bentonite 2e 11 nzvi bentonite 2h fe 2 bentonite h 2 12 fe 2 bentonite h 2 o 2 oh oh fe 3 bentonite 13 fe 2 bentonite oh fe 3 bentonite oh 14 h 2 o 2 oh ooh h 2 o the laterite which is enriched with iron was used to obtain the iron nanoparticles fenps utilizing the eucalyptus leaf extracts 133 the iron nanoparticles were contained with fe0 fe2o3 and fe3o4 and had a specific surface area of 36 62 m2 g the fenps catalyzed fenton like process was used for the degradation of ametryn 2 ethylamino 4 isopropylamino 6 methylthio s triazine from an aqueous medium moreover the optimized physico chemical conditions were as 2 125 6 3 5 and 135 min for ph h2o2 cod ratio h2o2 fe ratio and reaction time respectively having the h2o2 dose of 17 and 2 83 mg l of catalyst 112 similarly pirsaheb et al 134 created a novel nanocomposite using nzvi particles encapsulated on carbon dot films and utilized as a nanocatalyst in the fenton like process for the degradation of two widely used antibiotics viz amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin it was stated that encapsulating nzvi particles on biopolymer based carbon dots boosts air water stability and enhances the reactivity of nzvi with h2o2 the role of carbon dots in the process is to safely preserve the nzvi particles against aggregation oxidation and slow discharge in an aqueous medium with time recently another carbon based material biochar supported nzvi catalyzed fenton like process was used for the remediation of antibiotics biochar is microporous that facilitated the impregnation of nzvi efficiently 135 the synthesis of iron based magnetic nanoparticles implanted with the mesoporous carbon based hybrid material fe mesoc was strategically synthesized in a metal organic framework mil 100 fe this novel nano fenton like catalytic system was intended to utilize for the elimination of sulfamethoxazole smx the probable mechanism of the catalyst is shown in fig 5 further the composite materials were successfully recycled for repeated operations 136 in a line the fe based metal organic framework mil 88b fe 137 mil 53 fe 138 mil 100 fe fe3o4 ca mnpcs 139 derived catalysts were obtained and utilized as a fenton like catalyst for the elimination of various organic pollutants from aqueous solutions iron oxides are chemical compounds containing iron and oxygen it occurs on the earth s surface as the mineral magnetite the catalytic performance of nanoparticles of iron iii oxides in the fenton like process in the degradation of ethylene glycol and phenol in the absence of uv irradiation was investigated 140 results indicated that the degradation rate was considerably increased as compared to the photo implemented conventional fenton s process 140 iron oxide nanoparticles supported on the hydroxylated surface of modified diamond nanoparticles were obtained further the visible light assisted heterogeneous catalyst was utilized for the fenton like reaction to remove phenol it was reported that the catalyst s superior catalytic activity was obtained compared to the equivalent carbon based catalysts such as activated carbon graphite or the standard feox tio2 photocatalyst 141 it was noted that the iron based nano fenton like catalyst attracted greater attention in recent times and showed fair catalytic efficiency and reusability in reactor operations however the implications of laboratory scale trials to technology development need further large scale or pilot scale treatment the challenges are ahead with the actual or complex matrix treatment at the large scale treatment moreover the sludge contained with iron is a considerable challenge for recycling such leachates in the cost effective sustainability of the reactor operations furthermore the greener synthesis method devoid of harmful chemicals is the need of the hour however the optimization of reaction for technology development is an additional challenge lying ahead 3 2 copper based nflc similar to the zero valent iron the nano zero valent copper has attracted greater attention recently because of its unique properties and stability in the dispersed medium 142 143 compared to iron 0 44 v fe2 fe copper possesses relatively higher potential 0 34 v cu2 cu vs the normal hydrogen electrode nhe therefore it is not reacting with hydrogen ions h to generate h2 hence helpful in triggering o2 to produce h2o2 0 70 v o2 h2o2 on the catalyst s surface 143 the reactions involved are given in eqs 15 16 144 15 cu h 2 o 2 cu 2 oh oh k 1 0 10 4 m 1 s 1 16 cu 2 h 2 o 2 cu o 2 h oh k 4 6 10 2 m 1 s 1 several studies are conducted utilizing the nano zero valent copper heterogeneous catalyst in the fenton like processes to degrade several micro pollutants from aqueous solutions in the reactor operations the diethyl phthalate dep was completely degraded by the zero valent copper nzvc in 120 min at ph 2 5 the mechanism was investigated and showed that under aerobic atmospheric conditions the possible redox reactions are as follows eqs 17 19 145 17 cu 2 2 e cu 0 e 0 0 340 v 18 cu e cu 0 e 0 0 520 v 19 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 e 0 0 700 v similarly the commercial nanosized zero valent copper nzvc was utilized to degrade norfloxacin nor under the fenton like process and ultrasonic reactor operations the us nzvc h2o2 system greatly favored the nor degradation compared to the conventional fenton process the leaching of cu ions from the nzvc was assumed to be the predominant species which gives rise to activating the h2o2 for producing oh radicals the mechanism of nor degradation due to the different cu species along with h2o2 present in the reaction system was underlined as in eqs 20 27 146 20 cu h 2 o 2 cu 2 o h free o h 21 cu oxidant cu 2 e 22 cu 0 cu o h 1 2 h 2 23 cu 2 h 2 o 2 cu o 2 2 h 24 cu h 2 o 2 cu 2 o h abs o h 25 cu 2 h 2 o 2 cu o 2 2 h 26 cu 2 o 2 cu o 2 27 oh nor intermediates the use of ultrasound in aqueous solutions produces the radical species which provides the synergistic influence in eliminating micropollutants 77 147 the nzvc assisted fenton like process using 20 300 and 520 khz ultrasonic frequency was conducted to degrade phenol further the operating frequency of 300 khz in ultrasound showed a maximum phenol removal per unit power dissipation and the extent of total organic carbon elimination 77 macroporous graphene supported zero valent copper nanoparticles modified 3d structure 3d gn cu0 was obtained by a simple liquid phase reduction process the n2 adsorption desorption curves followed the type iv h3 type hysteresis loop which indicated the mesoporosity of solids cf fig 6 a moreover the formation of macropores 50 nm was characterized by the hysteresis loop of cu0 as it was shifted to p p0 1 0 143 it was further supported with the size distribution as achieved by the nldft method cf fig 6b without adding extra hydrogen peroxide very high efficiency in the degradation of metronidazole mnz was obtained by the novel 3d nanocatalyst in a wide ph range from 3 2 to 9 8 143 approximately 2 33 ppm of cu leached out from the nanocatalyst i e about 2 33 dissolution rate which was considerably less compared to cunps 55 36 ppm and the combination of cu0 and 3d gn 35 72 ppm cf fig 7 the reusability of the catalyst turned out to be worthy as the degradation was above 60 even after the third cycle of mnz degradation three different nano zero valent metals nzvms viz iron fe0 copper cu0 and nickel ni0 are utilized in the ultrasound assisted heterogeneous nano fenton like process in the degradation of nonylphenol each of these nzvms was subjected to reactor operations at neutral ph conditions the ability of various nzvms in the degradation of nonylphenol 6 ppm was found as fe0 cu0 ni0 109 further the nzvc h2o2 system was assessed in the degradation of benzoic acid it was noted that acidic conditions and higher doses of catalyst favored the degradation of benzoic acid greatly moreover the aid of h2o2 accelerates the corrosion of nzvc to release cu ions which eventually generates oh radicals via a fenton like reaction 148 the identification of the major reactive oxidant oh was identified by using an excess amount of isopropyl alcohol as a quencher as its reaction rate constant 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 is very high 149 do et al 150 synthesized a novel yolk like magnetic structured fenton like catalyst which was encapsulated in a silica shell and wrapped with copper nanoparticles in the presence of h2o2 the synthesized cunps decorated fe3o4 sio2 nanocatalyst showed efficient catalytic activity which resulted in the complete elimination of acetaminophen within 60 min of operation at the same time fe3o4 fe3o4 cu and fe3o4 sio2 exhibited 58 8 65 3 67 0 degradation respectively within 120 min of reactor operation cufeo2 nanoplates and nanocubes having different surface manifestations 012 and 110 were synthesized and characterized by the sem tem and hrtem methods and results are shown in fig 8 the cufe 012 nanoplate was found with a width and thickness of about 1 Î¼m and 50 nm having a lattice fringe of 0 251 nm in hr tem fig 8e on the other hand cubic structured cufe 110 has a lattice fringe of 0 152 nm in the hr tem image fig 8f the materials were intended to utilize in the fenton reaction in the degradation of ofloxacin ofx the degradation of ofx by cufeo2 012 was about four times faster than that of cufeo2 110 it was demonstrated that the electron transfer from cufeo2 012 facet result in the suitable oo bond elongation 1 472 Ã¥ i e bond length in h2o2 which leads to the production of reactive oxidant oh radicals whereas in the case of cufeo2 110 oo bond length is stretched from 1 468 Ã¥ to 3 290 Ã¥ which causes the formation of oh ions hence suppressing the degradation of pollutant molecules 151 cu fe3o4 core shell nanoparticles n cu fe3o4 were obtained and employed in pre treated landfill leachate for oxytetracycline otc degradation almost complete removal of 20 ppm otc was obtained within 30 min through the n cu fe3o4 h2o2 fenton like reaction at ph 3 0 the reusability and stability performance of the catalyst showed a gradual decrease in the removal of otc for five consecutive runs as 99 2 92 4 71 3 68 3 and 66 2 respectively 152 utilization of novel magnetic cufe2o4 spinel nanoparticles mediated fenton like oxidation of sulfanilamide was conducted it was reported that the cu ii on the cufe2o4 nanocomposite caused an enhanced degradation of sulfanilamide at around neutral ph conditions a comparative evaluation of the rate constant concerning the different catalytic systems such as cuo 2 60 10 2 l m min cufe2o4 nps 2 58 10 3 l m min fe3o4 1 92 10 3 l m min and Î± fe2o3 7 30 10 4 l m min were concluded that the activation by the h2o2 the reactivity of solid cu ii was efficient than that of fe iii at the neutral ph conditions further the lcms ms studies enabled the 11 degradation products devoid of sulfanilic acid therefore the possible pathway was through the cleavage of the cs bond rather than sn bond cleavage subsequently the mineralization of sulfanilic acid cf scheme fig 9 153 the inert surface of conditioned diamond nanoparticles npd is greatly enabled to generate and diffuse freely oh within the solution and interact feebly with the pollutant molecules 154 further the inert npd surface is helpful as support media for the ag au or even the cu nanoparticles and enhances the suitability of materials in the catalyzed reactions 155 157 in a line a novel fenton like catalyst consists of copper nanoparticles propped up on diamond nanoparticles dnps as synthesized by polyol reduction of cu no3 2 in the presence of dnps and utilized in the degradation of phenol 158 cunps dnps catalyst mediated fenton like system enables an enhanced degradation efficiency than analogous catalytic systems viz cunps activated carbon cunps carbon nanotubes and cunps tio2 p25 the catalyst had relatively less stability and activity upon reuse although it is possible to recover by reducing the catalyst again by the polyol method fenton like elimination of enrofloxacin efn at concentration level Î¼g l was conducted using several nanocatalysts viz copper oxides titanium carbide and silicon nitride nanoparticles the cuo h2o2 and tic h2o2 catalytic systems showed 90 degradation of the efn in 12 h in the presence of sodium halide salts the reaction rate was accelerated in the case of cuo nanoparticles mediated fenton like degradation two possible mechanisms explained this increase in reaction rate i an additional reaction pathway was provided by the salts which contained with the radical species which degrades enf readily and ii otherwise the presence of salts inherently accelerates the non radical mechanism for the degradation of enrofloxacin 159 the catalytic degradation of alachlor and phenanthrene was conducted using the nano sized copper oxide in the presence of h2o2 rapid degradation of these micro pollutants was obtained and the presence of several oxidants or salts inhibited the degradation rate of alachlor however very high concentrations 1 m of nacl favored the reaction rate of degradation significantly 160 several studies intended to assess the unsupported nanoparticles of copper oxide in the oxidative removal of nitrophenols 161 production of h2o2 162 and inactivation of bacteria 163 fenps cunps and fe cu bimetallic nps were employed in three different electro fenton catalytic systems to degrade nafcillin nfc the nfc drug was completely removed by the fe cu bimetallic nps mediated fenton like systems having less electrolysis time than that of fe and cu nps moreover the reusability of fe cu bimetallic nanocatalyst has shown about 77 degradation of the nfc even after three consecutive cycles 164 the use of nano zero valent copper showed a more significant drawback of its bulk particles hence the activity was reduced significantly since the active surface area was reduced for bulk particles 165 166 this suppressed the fenton reaction for degradation of several micro pollutants however the support media enabled to restrict the agglomeration of nanoparticles and enhanced the suitability applicability of materials 167 3 3 gold based nflc the use of gold nanoparticles in catalytic reactions has received greater attention recently since the colloidal or supported gold nanoparticles provide a bridge between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis 168 172 therefore nanoparticles played an important role in converging both the area of research i e the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis the standard reduction potential of gold i e all possible oxidation states of gold is very high 1 2 v because of that it was considered as a passive element for a long at least from a catalytic point of view however the nanoparticles or nanoscale clusters of gold have shown excellent catalytic activity hence paving the way for studying different gold catalyzed reactions 171 173 the excellent results utilizing the gold nanoparticles as fenton catalysts have shown the redox reactions as demonstrated with the au0 and au species eqs 25 26 174 177 25 au 0 h 2 o 2 oh oh au 26 au h 2 o 2 ooh h au 0 the gold nanoparticles supported on different support media viz hydroxyapatite hap fe2o3 tio2 and graphite c were obtained and utilized to remediation of organic pollutants the au hap showed maximum removal efficiency ph 2 5 compared to other catalysts it showed much enhanced catalytic activity than the typical iron ions exchanged zeolite fe zsm 5 catalyst in the fenton like degradation of phenol it was further suggested that the positively charged gold nanoparticles on hap a redox reaction au0 au occurs during the wet peroxidation reactions 178 the gold supported catalyst was utilized to produce in situ h2o2 and the studies were inadequate to demonstrate the formation of oh radicals 171 179 however the gold au decorated fenton treated diamond nanoparticles ho npd named au ho npd are obtained and employed for the elimination of phenol in aqueous solutions 175 the results showed that the catalytic generation of oh radicals is predominantly generated at the surface of au ho npd gold is involved with redox processes and reduction of h2o2 causes the oh the complete scheme is proposed in fig 10 further it was suggested that the hydroxyl radicals are not bound on the surface of the catalyst however they diffused in the solution and enhanced the catalytic degradation of phenol 175 similarly the fenton treated functionalized diamond nanoparticles dnp were utilized in the gene delivery process the dnp possessed extremely small sized nanoparticles 4 nm average size and was contained with enhanced surface oh groups the dnp was enabled to functionalize the thionine and it was observed with the hela cell nuclei moreover the triethylammonium functionalized dnp was electrostatically attracted by a plasmid contained with a green fluorescent protein gene hence it delivered the plasmid to cross the hela cell membrane 180 the raw diamond nanoparticles npd were enabled to generate a high density of surface oh groups in a line this further promoted the high density covalent functionalization of npd the high density of oh was confirmed with the ir 1h nmr and xps results the xps results indicated that the presence of o1s peak appeared at 533 70 ev cf fig 11 the xps spectra of raw npd and the ho npd shown for the o1s peak which was shifted by a factor of 2 2 concerning the co 181 the utilization of a large excess of h2o2 for the degradation of phenol was obtained by about 79 decomposition of h2o2 through the fenton process for the production of oh radicals however the gold supported diamond nanoparticles au dnp catalyst was found inactive at neutral ph and room temperature to enhance the performance of the catalyst at the neutral ph conditions different light energy sources like lamp irradiation 176 sunlight 177 etc were introduced in the studies the catalytic activity of au dnp in the fenton process was demonstrated with the plasmon excitation occurring at the surface of gold bombarding monochromatic light or even solar light therefore the transfer of electrons from gold to hydrogen peroxide eventually enabled to enhance the catalytic degradation process 176 the optimization of various physico chemical parameters viz ph reaction temperature h2o2 dose a pollutant to gold molar ratio etc in the degradation of phenol is carried out in batch reactor operations it was further interesting to note that the toxicity of the substrates was remarkably reduced using the biological treatment coupled with the fenton process named as the tandem process this enabled to decrease in the toc values even with the minimal aid of h2o2 complete detoxification of phenol was achieved at an initial ph of 4 and 50 c having the h2o2 and phenol concentrations of 4 0 and 320 mg l respectively employing the oxygenated conditions further it was observed that no aromatic compounds were detected in the treated samples however the presence of three and four carbon dicarboxylic acids were detected as by products moreover the complete detoxification of phenol was confirmed by the vibrio fischeri test 180 gold nanoparticles associated with the fenton process were done by quintanilla and his coworkers 174 to degrade phenol they anticipated a novel nano fenton like catalyst i e activated carbon supported gold nanoparticles as an efficient alternative for remediation of biologically reluctant chemicals activated carbon being the preferable supporting material compared to tio2 and fe2o3 contributes to its high adsorption capability to enhance the resultant degradation efficiency of the catalyst moreover negligible leaching of gold from the catalytic surface showed the stability and reusable property of the catalyst 174 the monometallic gold au or silver ag nanoparticles along with the bimetallic core shell auag nps were introduced in the fenton treatment for degradation of l leucine 182 the performance of the metal nanocatalysts was examined both with or without h2o2 reaction conditions via degradation of l leucine in aqueous solutions the catalytic activity of auag core shell bimetallic nanoparticles was found more efficient than monometallic au or ag nanoparticles for the degradation of amino acids 182 nine different catalyst samples having supported gold nanoparticles viz activated carbon ac carbon xerogel cx cxl carbon nanotubes cnt graphite gr nano diamond powder ndpw micro diamonds md and silicon carbides sc were synthesized using the two different techniques i e colloidal col process and double impregnation method dim the hrtem images and haadf micrographs of gold nanoparticles on these carbon solids are shown in fig 12 the presence of au nanoparticles were confirmed with the z contrast micrographs whereas the hrtem images showed the presence of gold nanoparticles as darker areas in the images cf fig 12 further the catalytic degradation efficiency of cyclohexane in aqueous solutions was assessed using these samples the performance of the catalyst depends on the size of gold nanoparticles impregnated on the support media the lower sizes generally exhibited better activity as well as the mesoporous property of the solids among all nine au carbon catalysts the au cnt col catalyst was found to be most efficient catalyst in the degradation of cyclohexane the reusability and stability of the materials showed a comparable removal efficiency even at the completion of six successive cycles 183 the use of gold nanoparticles in the fenton process is exceptionally efficient and showed greater viability for its possible implications in the unit operations particularly the advanced treatment processes of refractory pollutants from the wastewaters however gold is a precious metal and its cost depends on the market fluctuations and finds several external economic considerations therefore the issue is its viability and reusability is a significant concern for its possible introduction for ultimate use the challenges lie in the heterogeneous systems to recover and reutilize gold nanoparticles for sustained applicability additionally the support media is a matter of concern for the introduction of gold although the diamond platinum and other precious metals showed greater efficiency the price and associated factors restrained its implications in the wastewater treatment plants however carbonaceous materials viz activated carbon graphene carbon nanotubes or even natural clay or clay based materials etc are found suitable and useful alternatives in technology development 3 4 zinc based nflc like other transition metals zinc possesses the redox behavior having the reduction potential of 0 76 v zn2 zn which is lower than iron 0 44 v fe2 fe hence it readily releases electrons and gets oxidized the nano form of zinc metal or metal oxides have shown the capability of releasing electrons accordingly zinc nanoparticles received greater attention in their possible applications in the fenton processes 184 186 a newer heterojunction nanocatalyst using zinc oxide and iron vanadate fevo4 was synthesized by thermal mixing the tem images showed that the spherical shaped zno particles have ca 25 nm in size whereas the fevo4 have the shape of rods cf fig 13 the zno fevo4 nanocatalyst is introduced to remove sodium dodecyl sulphate sds and a synergistic effect was observed using the uv light assisted fenton like process complete degradation of 40 mg l sds at ph 5 5 and 1 57 ml of h2o2 during 45 min of reaction time was achieved the catalyst showed excellent stability and reusability in repeated reactor operations 187 similarly the different metals co ni mn substituted the sol gel process synthesized zinc ferrite catalysts these catalysts were engaged in the remediation of potential water pollutant 4 chlorophenol 186 188 189 various physico chemical parametric studies were performed using different compositions of both the trimetallic catalysts under neutral conditions and observed that the substitution of zinc significantly enhanced the activity of the catalyst compared to the ferrite catalyst moreover interesting to observe that a direct correlation was obtained between the amount of catalyst and the extent of degradation of 4 chlorophenol which inferred that the fenton reactions take place on the surface of the catalyst further negligible leaching of iron provides exceptional stability and reusability than other higher iron containing catalysts and owns the capability for its further implications in the refining of aquatic environments contaminated with probable micro pollutants znfe2o4 nanoparticles zfnps were synthesized by the co precipitation process and utilized as a heterogeneous photo electro fenton like catalyst in the degradation of benzotriazole bta from aqueous solutions the zfnps nanocatalyst exhibited relatively high catalytic efficiency and ca 91 2 of bta was degraded using uv light irradiation at an optimum ph of 3 for 3 h of reactor operations the bta elimination was increased due to enormous production of oh radicals eqs 27 and 28 when the applied negative potential was increased from 0 3 to 0 6 v in the photo electro fenton like process 27 o 2 2h 2e h 2 o 2 28 h 2 o 2 hv 2 oh further increase in applied potential gave a negative effect due to the possible side reactions eqs 29 and 30 in the degradation of the pollutant hence 0 6 v was an optimum potential for the efficient removal of bta 190 29 o 2 4h 4e 6h 2 o 30 h 2 o 2 2h 2e 2h 2 o yolk shell having the chemical formula of znfe2o4 has numerous active sites that enable it for a wide range of applications including electrocatalysis sensors catalysis or even the fenton processes etc 191 194 the solvothermal process synthesized the yolk shell znfe2o4 nanoparticles advanced analytical tools characterized the catalyst the tem images of the znfe2o4 10 showed a unique yolk shell structure having the lattice spacing of 0 25 nm which is ascribed to the 3 1 1 crystal planes of znfe2o4 jcpds no 22 1012 cf fig 14 a b the yolk shell consists of small particles having a polycrystalline structure fig 14 c d further the elemental mapping fig 14 f h showed uniform distribution of zn fe and o elements within the solid the yolk shell was employed as a nano fenton like catalyst for visible light supported fenton like process in the remediation of tetracycline tc 194 the result indicated that compared to the raw znfe2o4 or Î± fe2o3 catalysts the catalytic activity of znfe2o4 10 nanocatalyst is much higher at least in the degradation of tc the nanocatalyst was stable in the fenton process and showed comparable removal efficiency for tc at a wide ph range based on the experimental findings the reaction mechanisms were demonstrated with eqs 31 39 194 31 znfe 2 o 4 vis znfe 2 o 4 e h 32 h 2 o 2 e oh oh 33 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh 34 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 ooh h 35 fe 2 ooh

materials having different weight ratios of zn were synthesized and employed in the fenton like degradation of 4 nitrophenol among all the different compositions of the nanocomposites the degradation efficiency was followed by the order z 90 g 10 z 90 c 10 z 70 g 30 z 70 c 30 further combined ultrasound and light coupled fenton like process showed a synergistic effect in the degradation of 4 nitrophenol 195 metal organic framework mof is the designed porous materials and showed a wide range of applications in storage catalysis separation water treatment etc 196 199 the mof has also shown suitability in the photo fenton like processes therefore the mesoporous mil 100 fe doped with zno nanosphere was obtained and employed in the photo fenton like degradation of three important water micro pollutants viz phenol bisphenol a and atrazine since the mesoporous mil 100 fe showed higher catalytic efficiency than microporous mil 100 fe the decoration of zno on the mof surface showed remarkably superior photo fenton catalytic activity visible light radiation along with h2o2 provides enhanced production of oh radicals that act in oxidizing the target pollutants the mesoporous mil 100 fe provides open pore cavities that allow all the external and internal surfaces to get attached to the reactants during the reaction process on the other hand the zno nanospheres effectively inhibit the recombination of excited e h pairs 200 3 5 manganese based nflc transition metal exchanged ferrites viz mxfe3 xo4 m mn co ni or cu has received much attention in the recent past to overcome the difficulties associated with the iron based fenton processes 201 204 therefore the use of mn in the iron exchanged solids attracted attention in developing heterogeneous catalysts these heterogeneous catalysts are employed efficiently in a variety of photocatalytic fenton like processes the mn3o4 as written as mno mn2o3 having spinel type structure is a useful heterogeneous catalyst enhancing the catalytic activity employed in the heterogeneous catalyst 205 206 the suitability of mn in the fenton process is due to the redox cycle of mn ii and mn iii e0 mn3 mn2 1 51 v which is considerably greater than that of fe ii 0 44 v fe2 fe therefore a novel heterogeneous nanocomposite based fenton like catalyst was designed using the nanocrystalline mn3o4 inside mesoporous sba 15 silica mn3o4 sba 15 the use of catalyst enabled the degradation of the ethanol 100 ppm in the presence of h2o2 in an aqueous solution 207 concerning the catalytic activity the maximum catalytic activity was achieved at ph 6 7 at an optimum temperature of 343 k moreover the degradation ability of the nanocomposite composed of mn nanocrystals on sba 15 was 20 times higher than that of commercially available mn3o4 under identical reaction environments further the reaction rate was dependent on the content of intermediate radicals formed i e oh o2 and ho2 which was formed with the decomposition of h2o2 207 spinel manganese ferrite mnfe2o4 nanoparticles were obtained by the co precipitation method and employed in the fenton like degradation of 4 chlorophenol the presence of h2o2 enabled the hydroxyl radicals by the transition of fe2 to fe3 and mn2 to mn3 the studies optimized the physico chemical parameters using the fitted model which inferred the solution ph peroxide concentration and catalyst dosage were 4 24 0 07 mol l and 0 72 g l respectively further for the 23 11 mg l of 4 chlorophenol concentration at 61 min of reaction time the maximum 93 degradation was achieved 208 similarly mnfe2o4 sio2 nanocomposite was synthesized using the nano casting method employing mesoporous silica gel as a templating material compared to the silica template the prepared nanocomposite showed a decrease in specific bet surface area and pore volume from 340 m2 g 0 89 cm3 g to 222 m2 g 0 52 cm3 g respectively the nanocomposite possessed a high activity in the complete decomposition of 3 mol l h2o2 as achieved in 5 min the nanocomposite was examined only towards the decomposition of h2o2 hence no specific reaction mechanism was proposed ensuring the fenton chemistry 209 wan et al 210 investigated the reaction mechanism and kinetics of sulfamethazine smt degradation with a novel fe3o4 mn3o4 nanocomposite catalyzed heterogeneous fenton like system the presence of mn3o4 in the nanocomposite materials enhanced the catalytic efficiency in smt degradation via leaching of mn3 which subsequently reduced to mn2 by fe2 since the reduction potential of both the metals are e0 mn3 mn2 1 51 v e0 fe3 fe2 0 771 v respectively eqs 40 and 41 also shown the schematic in fig 15 40 mn 3 fe 2 mn 2 fe 3 41 mn 2 h 2 o 2 mn 3 h 2 o oh the reusability of catalyst was evaluated employed for five successive operations under similar experimental conditions the percentage degradation was gradually decreased from 94 to 60 at the end of the fifth cycle of operation similarly manganese dioxide mno2 is a common constituent of soils and sediments it possessed low environmental toxicity and had unique physicochemical properties viz dynamic redox potential large surface area and various oxidation states 211 it was also reported that manganese dioxide readily agglomerated due to the strong attractive van der waals forces this led to the reduced surface area hence limiting its catalytic activity 212 immobilized or doped manganese dioxide nanoparticles with suitable porous materials provided excellent properties and significantly restricted the nanoparticles agglomeration therefore the hierarchical manganese dioxide biochar mno2 bcs nanocomposite was obtained by the hydrothermal method 213 and utilized for the remediation of bisphenol a bpa in an ultrasound assisted fenton like system the sem tem morphological studies showed that the mno2 nanoparticles were impregnated on the surface of biochar with two different morphologies i flower like Î´ mno2 and ii urchin like Î± mno2 further the urchin like Î± mno2 bcs nanocomposite showed much enhanced degradation efficiency for bpa in the fenton like system at the bpa initial concentration of 100 Î¼m bpa within 20 min at neutral ph condition the synergistic effect was observed using ultrasonication 20 khz further the peroxymonosulfate activated catalyst mn doped bifeo3 nanoparticles were used to efficiently degrade bisphenol a 214 it is known that so4 radical is a strong oxidizing agent having redox potential of so4 2 5 to 3 1 v the bimetallic catalyst i e mn and fe ions in the mn doped bfo is activated greatly in presence of peroxymonosulfate via so4 radicals which led to the complete degradation of bisphenol a in 15 min of visible light irradiation similarly the peroxymonosulfate activated mn fe2o3 graphene hybrid material was utilized for the elimination of organic pollutants 215 the reaction rate was found much higher than that of other processes including degradation by bfo with h2o2 or peroxymonosulfate the presence of four times co existing ions viz kbro3 na2co3 nacl and nano3 showed a positive effect in the presence of kbro3 and nano3 this was due to the formation of stronger reactive radicals species no3 and bro2 than so4 which promoted the oxidation of organic pollutants however the presence of na2co3 and nacl hindered the oxidation of bpa due to the formation of so4 quencher 3 6 palladium based nflc the standard redox potential of palladium is 0 95 v vs she standard hydrogen electrode which is much higher than that of the redox potential of iron hence the palladium element is helpful for its possible implications in the fenton like process however the literature review reveals that only scanty studies were conducted using the pd in the fenton like processes 216 218 one of the reasons is that the element is precious and expensive and it needs a suitable support media to disperse the palladium nanoparticles 219 however it was reported that the palladium is present in the membrane and intracellular e faecalis where it plays a vital role in electron transfer or catalytic actions of several biological functions 220 therefore the use of bio pd in the synthesis of catalysts enables to reduction of the cost of the catalyst in a line the bio derived pd was utilized to synthesize novel bio pd fe fe2o3 nanoparticles and the catalyst was employed for the fenton like degradation of sodium diclofenac 219 the enterococcus faecalis e faecalis bacteria were used as a source of pd the bio pd fe fe3o4 nps were found to be circular shaped having an average size of 9 nm the optimized percentage degradation of diclofenac 10 ppm in 20 min and 40 min was achieved as 94 69 and 99 65 respectively various parametric studies in the removal of diclofenac are shown in fig 16 the dissimilar metal corrosion of nzvi by the pd fe oxidation reduction reaction gives rise to the leaching of iron ii ions into the solutions eventually takes part in the production of oh radicals as a result of that a high reaction rate in the fenton like degradation of diclofenac was accomplished it was further mentioned that the dechlorination and oh radical generation was due to the production of active hydrogen which later initiated the ring opening reaction followed by gradual mineralization of diclofenac 221 223 the bimetallic nanocatalyst fe3o4 pd was synthesized and applied in the electrochemical process combined with fenton like degradation to remove pentachlorophenol pcp complete degradation of pcp was reached in 30 min of reactor operation using the fe3o4 pd nanocatalyst at the optimized physico chemical conditions as ph 2 3 temperature 288 k and electric field 5 v the mechanism of fe leaching is driven by the presence of pd nanoparticles present on the surface of fe3o4 the reusability tests of the catalyst showed that a significant decrease in catalyst performance was observed with repeated use of a catalyst 224 pd was loaded with the magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles pd mnps and the catalyst was employed in the electro fenton like degradation of phenol from aqueous solutions 225 the novel electrocatalytic system showed around 98 degradation of 20 ppm phenol within an hour at ph 3 the rate of the fenton degradation of phenol was increased by increasing the pd loading an applied electric field and it was decreased by increasing the initial concentration of phenol cf fig 17 the in situ production of h2o2 was attained from the electrochemical reaction between anodic o2 and cathodic h2 a novel green and one pot synthesis were conducted to obtain the core shell fe3o4 coated pd nanoparticles hybrid material pd fe3o4 mofs further hollow fe mofs were introduced to engross hybrid material to get the yolk shell structured composite yolk shell pd fe3o4 mofs which was relatively stable and prevented the aggregation of pd this was then utilized in the fenton like remediation of phenols and chlorophenols the transfer of electrons from pd to fe3o4 assisted the fe iii fe ii redox cycle which enabled the generation of oh through continuous decomposition of h2o2 a high value of mineralization of these pollutants was achieved by maintaining a low h2o2 pollutant molar ratio the catalyst was utilized to treat tannery wastewater and found that despite the presence of many co existing ions the yolk shell pd fe3o4 mofs still exhibited exceptional catalytic activity 226 similarly the fe metal organic framework derived core shell fe pd c nanocatalyst is obtained and employed in the electro fenton like reaction to degrade phenol the modified fe pd c nanocatalyst enabled the continuous discharge of fe2 ions through dissimilar metal corrosion of fe0 anode which subsequently initiated the decomposition of h2o2 and produced readily the oh this enabled an efficient 95 mineralization of phenol within 10 min at ph ca 5 6 it was further noted that negligible leaching of iron was observed hence the fe pd c catalyst remained stable in the fenton process in contrast to commercial fe c material the modified fe pd c nanocomposite showed significantly enhanced catalytic efficiency better stability and prolonged reactor operations 227 further table 1 included a summary of various nflcs utilized in different forms of fenton like processes for the degradation of a variety of organic micro pollutants 4 conclusion and future perspectives the fenton like process is bridging the homogeneous to the heterogeneous chemistry of catalysts the heterogeneous fenton like process is useful for the decontamination of aquatic environments from recalcitrant micropollutants the process tunes the existing wastewater treatment technology to remove the persistent micro pollutants and provides a safe and viable treatment technology the fenton like reaction using the nzvi is a nice alternative in the treatment process it overcomes several disadvantages of the classical fenton process including the enormous amount of sludge formation and its disposal operating low ph conditions and selectivity of contaminants in water bodies further the use of bimetallic composed of transition metal or metal oxide nanoparticles and the nano zero valent iron in the fenton like processes has attracted greater attention since it provides enhanced catalytic action with synergistic effects this eventually minimizes the dose of hydrogen peroxide in the reactor operations additionally the nanoparticles of the noble metals viz ag au pt etc are practical alternatives that synergize the fenton process in a line the support media is essential in the catalytic action of these nanomaterials in the fenton like process the use of mesoporous materials including the carbon nanotubes graphene oxide reduced graphene clay materials etc are useful alternatives providing the high specific surface area for impregnation or doping of the nanomaterials nanoparticles which eventually enhances the reaction processes with a reduced agglomeration of nanoparticles also reduces the corrosion of catalyst in the reaction mixture these novel systems have provided innumerable advantages in the fenton like methods for treating several micro pollutants from aqueous solutions the fenton process is although several advantages and is relatively cost effective and greener however the challenges remain in the widespread application in technology development or scaling up the technology the fenton like process is primarily based on the oh radical generation using iron and hydrogen peroxide hence the treatment method is not selective the selectivity using the advanced nanomaterials or the nanocomposites are viable alternatives hence extensive studies are to be carried out controlling nanoparticle dispersion and agglomeration to obtain a nanomaterial with innovative physical and chemical properties for near future technological implications is a research area to study extensively further the majority of fenton research is conducted in laboratories and has limited commercial applications the natural matrix treatment is entirely different from the laboratory experimentation since the actual wastewater samples are composed of complex matrices which significantly hampers the treatment method therefore trials with actual matrix samples are required in the large scale treatment to scale up the process similarly the use of heterogeneous catalysts using the nanomaterials nanocomposites has less stability reactivity in the successive reactor operations which significantly restricted the reuse of catalysts in sustainable operations moreover the instability causes increased corrosion and creates an extra load to the environment for its discharge or disposal the use of natural biopolymers and plant extracts is to be exploited to synthesize nanoparticles or nanocomposites which may provide a greener route of catalyst synthesis the utilization of bio recovered metals and supporting materials for the synthesis of nanocatalyst or nanocomposites is not acquired enough attention which practically helps maintain the cost of the treatment process for the degradation micro pollutants moreover the in situ generation of h2o2 is attractive and needs enhanced attention for its widespread use the amalgamation of different physical fields phenomena can synergize the catalytic efficiency selectivity with enhanced reaction rate perhaps needs greater attention in fenton like processes credit authorship contribution statement prof diwakar tiwari major drafting of the review

13202,polyethylene terephthalate pet waste was converted into graphene by pyrolysis and the synthesized graphene sg was modified into activated graphene ag by potassium hydroxide koh impregnation and nano ferromagnetic activated graphene nfmag by nanometric iron oxide coating via co precipitation and external reduction method the chemical textural and structural properties of sg ag and nfmag were

reusability of sg ag and nfmag was assessed for five adsorption cycles nfmag exhibited excellent stability and reusability due to its ease of magnetic separation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene activated carbon ferromagnetic composite dye adsorption recycling 1 introduction dyes such as methylene blue mb are chemicals that are widely used in textiles paper bleaching cosmetics and plastics industries 1 current population growth and anthropogenic activities have resulted in an excessive release of dyes containing wastewaters into the natural environment 2 this leads to serious environmental and health issues since dye pollutants are stable resistant to bio degradation toxic carcinogenic and reduce sunlight penetration in water 3 therefore there is an urgent necessity to investigate more efficient cheaper and green technology to thoroughly treat these wastewaters before outdoor discharge 4 recent technologies employed in the treatment of dye polluted wastewaters include electrocoagulation photocatalysis biological treatment membrane separation anodic oxidation nanofiltration ozonation and adsorption 5 11 adsorption technology has some drawbacks such as cost of adsorbents and expensive regeneration process however the high removal efficiency affordability and ease of operation make adsorption technology an attractive choice for numerous water decontamination processes 10 12 13 recent researches are focusing on structural and compositional modification of carbonaceous adsorbents to improve their adsorption properties 14 chemical activation is one of the most interesting carbon modification concepts because activated carbon ac features a high specific surface area and remarkable internal pore structure good mechanical thermal and chemical stability high adsorption capacity high surface reactivity high availability low cost flexibility eco friendly application and ease of regeneration 4 chemical activation involves the enhancement of the surface chemistry of the materials by interactions with salts acids and bases 11 magnetization of carbon using metal compounds such as iron fe cobalt co and nickel ni oxides and salts is another fascinating adsorbents modification phenomenon 15 16 ferromagnetic compounds especially magnetite fe3o4 are suitable supportive materials for carbon because they can be easily controlled and remove from the adsorbate solution by an external magnet without filtration or centrifugation 17 18 this saves time and reduces the rate of sorbent loss during regeneration 17 19 other benefits of magnetic composite adsorbents include minimization of secondary pollution high efficiency and low material and energy cost 18 20 amongst several techniques to synthesize magnetic carbon the co precipitation method was employed in this work due to its advantages such as separation of nucleation and slow growth of nuclei resulting in uniform particle size of the product 21 iron oxides are the most widely used materials for adsorbent magnetization because they have a strong magnetic response are biocompatible resourceful and are easy to use 22 moreover iron is one of the most abundant elements readily available and relatively cheaper for enhancing the efficiency of adsorbents 23 the adsorption property of magnetic carbon materials has been widely studied for the elimination of both inorganic and organic contaminants from waters 24 25 magnetic functionalized carbons may have lesser surface area because of the filling of carbon pores by iron however higher adsorption capacities can be achieved depending on the chemical interaction between the sorbent surface and the pollutant 17 24 on the other hand plastics are an integral part of the modern economy due to their characteristics and low cost contrarily due to their unique features such as stability and resistance to many chemicals plastics tend to remain in the environment for decades without undergoing natural degradation 26 this has led to severe environmental impacts since most plastic wastes are not properly managed 26 polyethylene terephthalate pet is the third largest non fiber plastic making up 10 of total plastic production pet pe and pp make up 42 of all non fiber plastics that have short one time use thus their high amounts in municipal waste 26 28 meanwhile the need to investigate inexpensive and suitable materials as carbonaceous adsorbent precursors remains paramount in current technology 29 these precursors must contain low inorganic impurities with high carbon and volatile content and must be readily available 29 30 pet contains predominantly carbon and some amount of hydrogen 28 pet also contains less to no impurities making it an excellent candidate for numerous upcycling 31 several studies have demonstrated the possible direct recycling of waste plastics such as metallurgical reduction or upgrade of ores 32 33 other studies also illustrated the potential of converting waste pet into other valuable materials such as liquid and gaseous fuels and carbon materials such as carbon microspheres carbon nanoparticles and activated carbon 34 37 in this study pet waste is selected as a cheap feedstock for graphene synthesis as well as providing a green and sustainable solution to environmental problems caused by waste plastics the graphene is modified into activated and nano ferromagnetic functionalized graphene composite to enhance its properties for mb removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents empty pet water bottles

waste bottles were thoroughly washed with water to remove dirt sundried and then shredded into pieces 10 g of the shredded plastic was introduced into a 420 ml stainless steel 316 autoclave and tightly sealed and placed at the center of a muffle furnace ash amf 25 n based on a previous study the thermal decomposition was done at a ramping rate of 27 c min 1 and the temperature was maintained at 600 c for 1 h 38 the system was afterward left to cool overnight the graphene synthesis is illustrated in fig s1a c the dark product sg was collected and milled using retsch pm 400 planetary ball mill for 5 min to under 425 Î¼m sizes and then stored in a desiccator the yield of sg was calculated as follows 1 yield dry weight of sg dry weight of pet precursor 100 sg was impregnated with 50 koh

activated in a muffle furnace with heating rate of 27 c min 1 under nitrogen gas flow 100 ml h 1 at 600 c the activation temperature was maintained for 1 h before cooling under nitrogen flow after cooling the activated graphene labelled as ag was washed with 0 2 m hcl and then deionized water till neutral ph to remove residual naoh and other inorganic activation by products such as alkaline carbonates finally ag was dried at 120 c for 2 h and then kept in a pyrex desiccator the percent yield was calculated using the relation 2 yield dry weight of ag dry weight of pet precursor 100 3 g of fecl2 4h2o and 3 g of fecl3 were dissolved in a synthetic solution of 100 ml deionized water and 50 ml ethanol co solvent under stirring 3 g of ag was introduced on to the synthetic solution with continuous stirring at 500 rpm for 3 h 1 m naoh was then added dropwise to the mixture until a ph of 8 1 m nabh4 was added in drops to the resultant mixture till the formation of a black precipitate the precipitate was vacuum filtered and thoroughly washed with ethanol and distilled water several times and then dried at 110 c for 2 h the dried cake labelled nfmag was crushed and kept in a desiccator nfmag was readily attracted by an external magnet as shown in fig s1d and maintained its magnetic property after it was applied in the water treatment fig s1e 2 3 characterization techniques the prepared materials were characterized using different analytical techniques the surface morphology of the prepared adsorbents was examined using sem jeol jsm 6010lv japan tem equipped

pore size total pore volume bet surface area and pore distribution of the prepared adsorbents were analyzed using microtrac mrb belsorp mini x japan the samples were degassed at 180 c overnight before the analysis 2 4 point of zero charge phpzc 0 15 g of sg ag and nfmag were separately mixed with 50 ml of 0 1 m of nacl and adjusting the solution ph between 2 and 12 using diluted naoh and 0 1 m of hcl equilibration was achieved by shaking in a thermostatic bath for 24 h at 25 c the dispersions were filtered and the relation between final and initial ph was plotted 2 5 adsorption tests to

compute the model parameters 39 8 ln q e ln k f 1 n f ln c e where kf mg g 1 is a constant and a function of the energy of adsorption and temperature the slope 1 nf ranging between 0 and 1 measures the surface heterogeneity or sorption intensity 41 2 7 kinetics and mechanism of dye adsorption the adsorption kinetic and mechanism models were examined for mb dye sorption with sg ag and nfmag at various initial concentrations 50 100 150 and 200 mg l 1 the pseudo first order eq 9 pseudo second order models eqs 10 12 intraparticle diffusion model eq 13 and liquid film diffusion eq 12 were used

magnet and were washed with deionized water then sg and ag were dispersed in 50 ml 0 1 m hcl at 500 rpm for 90 min after elution sg and ag were separated from the resultant solution by filtration the adsorbents were then soaked in distilled water and left overnight sg and ag were afterward separated by filtration and dried at 110 c for 1 h the dye loaded nfmag was mixed with 50 ml of ethanol water 1 1 solution and stirred at 500 rpm for 1 h afterward nfmag was separated by an external magnet washed with distilled water and dried at 110 c for 1 h the dried regenerated adsorbents were reused in 5 cycles of mb adsorption and the removal efficiency was computed after each cycle 3 results and discussion 3 1 yield of sg and ag in the thermal decomposition of pet it is well established that pet degrades to release gaseous hydrocarbons and further break down ch and cc bonds to form solid carbon c 35 sg yielded 21 84 of the pet precursor this is due to some gaseous hydrocarbons hydrogen and water vapour that remain during the thermal decomposition however these gases and vapour serve as reducing agents keeping the carbon in the solid form 38 43 meanwhile the yield of ag was 18 77 of the pet precursor 86 of sg koh is a strong stable and corrosive base that is even a stronger caustic base at elevated temperatures and thus can react with quite inert carbon materials 42 therefore the further reduction in the yield resulted from the elimination and dehydration reactions by koh and the breakdown of coc ch and cc bonds 44 the activation process is a solid liquid redox reaction where hydroxides are transformed into hydrogen alkaline metals and alkaline carbonate due to carbon precursor oxidation as shown in eq 18 45 18 6 koh 2 c 2 k 3 h 2 2 k 2 co 3 3 2 characteristics of sg ag and nfmag 3 2 1 morphological structure of prepared adsorbents sem and tem micrographs of all prepared adsorbents are shown in fig 1a c and e f respectively for sg the sem micrograph reveals a blend of blocky and fibrous morphologies fig 1a the sharp edged blocky structures have smooth surfaces with varying sizes 0 3 Î¼m and shapes which suggest a continuous consumption of material due to activation of the exterior and interior of sg 46 tem image of sg shows transparent sheets with shadows depicting the agglomeration of graphene sheets fig 1d meanwhile the sem micrograph of ag depicts the effects of the reaction between sg and koh as seen in the corrosion of several surfaces and the size reduction of the blocky sg morphology 0 1 Î¼m with uniformly distributed nano perforations fig 1b tem image of ag reveals rippled and entangled layers of graphene fig 1e dark portions suggest some deposit of graphite in ag however nfmag exhibits a rough morphological structure due to the dispersion of feo nanoparticles on the ag matrix fig 1c the feo nanoparticles disperse on all surfaces of nfmag thus occupying the cavities in the precursor ag from the tem micrograph fig 1f the nano feo appears as non uniform sized near spheres with diameters ranging from 10 to 52 nm the retaining of the nanometric dimensionality of the nano feo reveals the excellent support provided by ag during the magnetization process without agglomerating feo 24 the dark portions reveal deposits of the precursor graphene fig 1f 3 2 2 textural properties of prepared adsorbent the bet surface area mean pore diameter and total pore volume of sg ag and nfmag are given in table 1 the n2 adsorption by sg ag and nfmag fig s2a shows stabilized and limited adsorption at high relative pressure which denotes type 1 or langmuir isotherm according to iupac classification and a dominated microporous morphology of all adsorbents 45 the pore distribution of the prepared adsorbents as illustrated in fig s2b confirms the dominance of micropores with the effective pore diameter around 2 nm koh activation of sg increased the pore volume and bet surface area in ag with a slight increase in the mean pore diameter the reaction between koh and sg resulted in the release of volatile components which contributed to the improvement in the textural property of ag 10 moreover alkaline activation produces additional pores due to the redox reactions and oxidative modifications that resulted in the creation of the microporous ag and caused the deterioration and separation of the graphite layers 10 the high pore volume observed in ag can be further attributed to the increase in the number of pores due to the arrangement of carbon layers during the activation process 11 meanwhile the decrease in surface area and pore volume of nfmag is ascribed to the filling and distribution of iron oxides over the precursor ag surface 3 2 3 elemental analysis of sg ag and nfmag the thermal decomposition of waste pet produced a high purity carbon material containing 96 52 wt carbon and 1 79 wt oxygen with traces of silicon fig s3a ag is composed mainly of 73 02 wt carbon and 20 32 wt oxygen with limited amount of silicon fig s3b this increase in oxygen content in ag confirms the success of koh activation by the addition of oxygen groups as seen in the ftir spectra nfmag is made up of 23 77 wt carbon 17 07 wt oxygen and 65 45 wt iron fig s3c this suggests the successful ferro magnetization of ag to form nfmag 3 2 4 structural and crystallographic analysis sg has x ray diffraction peaks at 24 28 and 43 81 2Î¸ which are corresponded to the 002 and 101 planes of graphene respectively fig 2 jcpds card no 87 1526 the broadness of the 002 peak and interlinear spacing of 3 66 Ã¥ is characteristic of amorphous graphene which typically has wider interlinear spacing between the graphene sheets than that of crystalline graphite 3 44 3 55 Ã¥ 38 the amorphous nature of sg is attributed to the termination of sp2 bonds of carbon atoms or intercalation of the hexagonal planar units by oxygen thus disrupting any order in the graphitic plane 38 47 the 101 peak depicts stacks of parallel two dimensional graphene layers and firmly bound hybridized carbon atoms stacked in a translational sequence in hexagonal rings 47 similar but relatively weaker peaks of the graphitic planes at 2Î¸ value of 24 19 and 43 50 with interlinear spacing of 3 68 Ã¥ are observed in ag fig 2 x ray diffractogram of nfmag shows a flattening of the 002 graphitic peak and complete disappearance of the 101 graphitic peak while new peaks of iron oxide emerge the new peaks at 30 19 35 32 42 88 55 4 57 2 and 62 54 fig 2 corresponds to 202 311 400 422 511 and 440 reflection planes of magnetite fe3o4 respectively jcpds card no 19 0629 confirming the successful magnetization of the carbon material 3 2 5 ftir analysis before and after adsorption the existence of surface functional groups in sg ag and nfmag were identified before adsorption of mb dye by their respective ftir molecular vibrations as shown in fig 3a the peak at 1634 cm 1 is due to the cc stretching of aromatic rings which is an intrinsic characteristic of sp2 graphitic carbon that is evident in sg ag and nfmag 10 however the peak at 3433 cm 1 in all prepared materials is attributed to the oh stretching vibration due to the presence of molecular hydrogen bond of polymeric compounds such as alcohols carboxylic acids and phenols and lattice water the intensity of this free hydroxyl group peak increased after koh impregnation in ag and nfmag indicating the interaction between koh and sg surface the 2932 2366 1442 and 1055 cm 1 peaks in the prepared materials are ascribed to ch cooh co and co vibration respectively the ch groups of uniform and ununiformed stretching vibrations of methane groups confirm the removal of hydrogen during the pyrolysis of pet and koh activation 10 regarding nfmag it can be attributed to the ch bond formation during borohydride reduction 24 the peak at 650 cm 1 is attributed to out of plane angular deformation of aromatic rings in sg and ag meanwhile the unique strong peak at 600 cm 1 is characteristic of the feo bond stretching vibrations of fe3o4 in nfmag 17 24 this confirms the effective magnetization of ag via the impregnation of feo on its surface to form nfmag the oh cooh and feo groups are hydrophilic and favour effective dispersion of adsorbents in water while hydrophobic groups like cc increases the binding affinity towards contaminants 24 furthermore the adsorption mechanism of mb can be described by changes in ir spectra of adsorbents after adsorption as shown in fig 3b relevant and discrete modifications in ftir spectra of sg ag and nfmag occurred after mb adsorption as observed by the shifts of peaks changes in peak intensities the emergence of new characteristic peaks and the disappearance of initial peaks the initial peak at 3433 cm 1 of oh groups in all prepared adsorbents shifted and split into 3837 3737 cm 1 and the intensity reduced after adsorption this indicates that the mb molecules adsorption onto the adsorbents surface occurred by displacement of physically adsorbed water molecules 10 24 this further suggests that the mb adsorption occurred via hydrogen bonding between the adsorbents oh groups and the nh group in mb or via electrostatic attraction between deprotonated oh groups and nh of mb the peak at 2366 cm 1 shifted to 2336 cm 1 and became more intense after mb adsorption indicating a possible interaction between the nh and ch of mb molecules and the cooh in all the prepared adsorbents therefore the adsorption of mb by all the prepared adsorbent is favoured at higher ph medium where oh and cooh groups deprotonates rapidly to form o and coo which has a strong affinity and electrostatic attraction towards the nh of mb dye 15 48 the peak at 1634 cm 1 of cc groups in all adsorbents shifted to a higher wavelength at 1695 cm 1 with an increase in intensity mb molecules consists of cc bonds and have Ï electrons which interact with the Ï electrons of benzene rings existing in the prepared graphene based adsorbents through Ï Ï electron stacking 15 49 50 the new peak at 3608 cm 1 in all adsorbents is due to the bending vibration of the csc group of mb 51 52 the initial peak at 2932 cm 1 of ch group completely disappeared after mb adsorption elucidating possible oxidation of the functional group during the adsorption process the 1442 cm 1 peak shifted to 1521 cm 1 due to asymmetric stretching of cs cn and nh vibrations of mb dye 52 the peak at 1055 cm 1 of co shifted to 1035 cm 1 due to interactions with cs groups of mb 52 the shift of the initial 650 cm 1 peak to 673 cm 1 and the new 777 cm 1 peak are due to the wagging vibration of ch in the alkyl group and aromatic ring of mb 52 the distinct changes that occurred in the ftir peaks of oh cc cooh and co suggest that these surface functional groups of the prepared adsorbents can link and interact effectively with mb in solution and the adsorption process is favoured by interaction between mb and sg ag and nfmag surface charges 10 45 46 meanwhile the feo peak shifted from 600 cm 1 to 575 cm 1 in mb loaded nfmag that was utterly absent in sg and ag this reveals the possible involvement of the iron oxides nanoparticles in assisting mb diffusion into nfmag pores 50 a schematic diagram of the possible mb adsorption mechanism was proposed to illustrate the interactions between mb and the major functional groups as shown in fig 4 3 2 6 point of zero charge phpzc ac is an amphoteric material thus can be either positive or negative charged depending on the solution ph the ph at which the adsorbent surface exhibits zero net charge and electrically neutral is defined as phpzc 10 the phpzc of sg ag and nfmag was determined as 6 7 6 56 and 6 13 respectively the decrease in the phpzc of ag is due to its abundant oxygen functional groups such as the oh groups the further decrease of phpzc in nfmag can be attributed to the extra surface oxygen content donated by the iron oxides 10 50 cationic dye adsorption is favoured at ph phpzc where the surface of adsorbents are deprotonated 11 since the mb solution has a ph of 7 the modification of sg into ag and nfmag can impact positively on the removal of mb dye solution ph phpzc values of ag and nfmag 11 3 3 adsorption studies mb as shown in fig s4 dissolves in an aqueous medium to release c16h18n3s mb and cl ions 10 the adsorption of mb can take place via the motion of mb dye from the solution to the adsorbents surface interaction between adsorbate and adsorbents surface functional groups and diffusion of mb dye through the boundary layer to the adsorbents surface 53 these mechanisms form the basis for explaining the adsorption process 3 3 1 effect of contact time fig 5 shows mb adsorption qt behaviour which is rapid at the initial stages with all adsorbents due to high availability of active sites and then became steady and constant over a period as the adsorptive sites become filled since mb is a planar molecule mb was instantly adsorbed through Ï Ï electron donor acceptor between the aromatic backbone of mb and the graphene plane of the prepared adsorbents 50 54 adsorption equilibrium was achieved after 50 30 and 40 min for sg ag and nfmag respectively with respective equilibrium adsorption capacity qe of 172 73 243 93 and 218 79 mg g 1 respectively these equilibrium durations were maintained for subsequent tests with the respective adsorbents it is evident that the chemical activation of sg significantly improved the adsorption capacity of ag and nfmag this improvement is directly associated with the increase in surface area in ag thus increasing the available sites for dye adsorption moreover the more oxygen functionalized surface of ag and nfmag interacted effectively with the cationic mb molecules as demonstrated in the ftir analysis meanwhile the slight decrease in mb adsorption with nfmag compared to its precursor ag is ascribed to the blockage of some pores due to filling with fe3o4 as seen in the slight decrease in pore volume and surface area moreover aggregation of nfmag magnetic attraction between fe3o4 c adsorbents may reduce the total effective surface area of adsorbents and increases the diffusion pathlength thus reducing the sorption capacity as compared with ag 24 however magnetite has low phpzc and quickly becomes negatively charged fe o at ph 7 50 this assists mb molecules diffusion to the pores through electrostatic interactions 50 therefore magnetite played a significant role in the high mb sorption density within the pores of nfmag thence the better sorption capacity of nfmag than sg despite the reduction of its surface area and pore volume 50 3 3 2 effect of initial dye concentration with increasing initial mb dye concentration the amount of adsorbed dye qt increased as illustrated in fig 6 the mb sorption capacity of sg ag and nfmag increased from 122 7 213 6 and 193 6 mg g 1 respectively at mb concentration of 50 mg l 1 to 195 8 330 3 and 281 8 mg g 1 respectively at mb concentration of 50 200 mg l 1 the increasing mass transfer driving force due to increasing dye concentration enhanced the chances and number of collisions between mb molecules and the surface of the adsorbent this increase in mass transfer occurs from the solution phase to the solid phase at the initial adsorption period 11 meanwhile adsorption efficiencies of sg ag and nfmag decreased with increasing mb dye concentration this can be attributed to the forces of repulsion between the dye molecules in the adsorbents surface and the bulk phase after the initial rapid adsorption 10 moreover the ratio of the available binding sites to the initial dye concentration is higher at lower dye concentrations thus resulting in the possibility of complete mb sorption however at higher initial dye concentration the ratio becomes lower and there is rapid saturation of the adsorption sites which after a while hinders the movement of additional mb dye towards the adsorbents surface due to the increasing repulsive forces between the adsorbate and the remaining dye stuff 17 3 3 3 effect of adsorbent dosage the mb adsorption efficiency was enhanced with increasing dosage of all adsorbents as shown in fig 7 increasing the dose of adsorbent increases the contact between the dye and adsorbent surface due to the greater availability of active adsorption sites by the increase in total surface area and number of binding sites 41 moreover since the width of the mb molecules is 1 45 nm increasing adsorbent dose increases the number of pores available for mb sorption via pore filling 51 however the equilibrium amount of mb dye adsorbed qe reduced with increasing adsorbent dose aggregation of particles saturated the adsorption sites reducing the total effective surface area of adsorbents and increasing their diffusional pathlength 46 55 this in turn decreases the sorption capacity from fig 7 the maximum adsorption capacity was attained at a dose of 0 2 mg ml 1 for all adsorbents therefore 0 2 mg ml 1 of prepared adsorbents was selected as the optimum dose for subsequent experiments 3 3 4 effect of initial ph of mb solution the effect of initial solution ph on the mb removal efficiency was investigated at a ph range of 2 12 as shown in fig 8 the mb removal efficiency was enhanced by increasing mb solution ph for all three adsorbents in acidic conditions low ph the surface of the prepared adsorbents becomes positively charged due to the protonation of the functional groups on the surface of the adsorbent 10 this hinders mb adsorption due to the electrostatic repulsive forces between the positively charge adsorbent surface and cationic mb 10 46 moreover in such acidic conditions the concentration of protons is high and can strongly compete with the cationic mb ions for uptake by adsorptive sites 52 as the mb solution ph increases basic conditions deprotonation of surface functional groups such as oh and cooh groups occurs and the surface of the prepared adsorbent becomes negatively charged 10 this enhances the electrostatic attraction between the cationic mb molecules and the anionic sites of all prepared adsorbents which thence improves the adsorption capacity from fig 8 the optimum mb solution ph with sg is 12 however since no substantial increase in adsorption was observed from ph 10 to 12 with ag and nfmag ph 10 is selected as the optimum ph for mb removal with ag and nfmag 3 3 5 effect of mb solution temperature the mb removal efficiency with all prepared adsorbents increased with increasing the solution temperature fig 9 such a trend predicts the existence of strong attractive forces between adsorbents and mb molecules depicting a chemisorption process 41 the temperature adsorption effect is explained by the increase in the rate of diffusion of mb molecules from the solution bulk to the adsorbent surface across the external boundary layer and in the internal pores of the adsorbents temperature rise increases the mobility of mb molecules along with a decrease in thickness of the boundary layer surrounding the adsorbent which consequently decreases the mass transfer resistance of adsorbate in the boundary layer 41 furthermore at high temperatures activation creation of new active sites of the graphene based adsorbents may occur which subsequently facilitates the sorption of mb dye 10 3 4 adsorption potential and mechanism 3 4 1 adsorption isotherm the equilibrium mb adsorption plots of qe against ce for sg ag and nfmag sorption systems at 25 c is presented in fig 10 increasing mb dye concentration led to progressive coverage of the sg ag and nfmag surface indicating saturation due to the filling of the vacant adsorptive sites such progressive adsorption is characteristic of langmuir type adsorption isotherm 56 the model fit of the langmuir isotherm model and freundlich isotherm model are presented in fig s5a b respectively the calculated langmuir and freundlich isotherm parameters are summarized in table 2 according to the r2 values the langmuir models best represented the adsorption data indicating that the adsorption process with all adsorbents occurs in a homogeneous surface with identical energy sites and monolayer coverage adsorbate species 10 39 this indicates that the uptake of mb onto sg ag and nfmag is mainly a chemisorption process 10 the rl values are between 0 and 1 which indicates the favorability of the langmuir adsorption pattern 10 the rl values were reduced with ag and nfmag and this infers that the adsorption process was more effective and more irreversible with the modified graphene adsorbents than the pristine sg however the adsorption was more favoured with ag than nfmag as seen in the lower rl values higher kl values of ag meanwhile the 1 nf values decreased in nfmag and then ag which further implies that stronger interactions transpired between mb and the modified graphene adsorbents than the pristine sg 3 4 2 adsorption kinetics and mechanism the rate and mechanism of mb uptake parameters were estimated by fitting the experimental kinetics data to their respective linear equations the calculated results of the parameters are presented in table 3 the linear regression analysis reveals that the mb sg mb ag and mb nfmag adsorption systems follow the pseudo second order pso with a higher correlation than the pseudo first order pfo model at all mb concentrations moreover the calculated qe qe cal values obtained from the pseudo second order model of all adsorbents are closer to the experimental qe values qe exp than that of pseudo first order this indicates that the adsorption of mb by all prepared adsorbents was chemisorption and depends primarily on the adsorption capacity and not the initial dye concentration and the sorption process can be more stable at high temperatures 17 57 as illustrated in fig 4 the chemisorption of mb by all prepared adsorbents is proposed to have occurred via strong electrostatic interactions between the oxygen functional groups of the adsorbents deprotonated cooh and oh groups and mb meanwhile the high initial sorption rates h and low half life time t1 2 observed in mb ag and mb nfmag reveal that the sorption process after sg modifications became more prompt the intraparticle diffusion model ipd was used to determine the adsorption mechanism as illustrated in fig s6 all mb adsorbent plots exhibit similar trends and the adsorption mechanism is divided into three steps for each curve the first phase involves the adsorption or diffusion in larger pores which occurred at the exterior adsorbent surfaces in nfmag the negatively charged magnetite feo assisted in the diffusion of mb molecules at the exterior surface via electrostatic interactions the second phase is a gradual adsorption step and is controlled by intraparticle diffusion the third phase is the equilibrium step which is the slowest and final step the interaction between the dye molecules and the adsorbent active sites increased the adsorption intensity as the initial dye concentration increased thus the value of the intraparticle diffusion constant kid increased with increasing dye concentration 58 the boundary layer c in sg ag and mb nfmag can be attributed to particles agglomeration meanwhile the graphs of ln 1 qt qe vs t for mb adsorption with all prepared adsorbents fig s7 have higher linear correlation table 3 this shows that the film diffusion model is applicable if liquid film diffusion ldf is the rate control step its plot should be linear with zero intercept 41 however since the linear plots did not pass through the origin the liquid film diffusion model may not be the only rate controlling step consequently the mb dye adsorption kinetics with all prepared adsorbents may be regulated by liquid film diffusion or both intraparticle diffusion and liquid film diffusion the liquid film rate constants klf were between 0 032 and 0 111 min 1 for sg 0 105 0 176 for ag and 0 010 0 086 min 1 for nfmag 3 4 3 adsorption thermodynamics fig s8 presents the thermodynamic fit of mb adsorbent systems and the results of the thermodynamic parameters are summarized in table 4 the values of Î´h are positive and this indicates that the sorption process is endothermic with all adsorbents the negative Î´g values of all mb adsorbent systems reveal the adsorption processes were spontaneous mb sg mb nfmag mb ag increasing spontaneity this affirms the reactivity of ag and nfmag with mb as illustrated by the adsorption kinetics modeling analysis moreover the values of Î´g reduces as temperature increases which indicate that the adsorption processes were more spontaneous at elevated temperatures 59 the positive Î´s values imply an intensified degree of randomness in the solid and solution interface during the adsorption process 2 59 the positive Î´s values also confirms that the sorption process was a solvent replacement phenomenon where the dye molecules replace water molecules on the adsorbents surface to effect adsorption 60 3 5 reusability of spent adsorbents hcl is an effective solvent for desorbing methylene blue mb and was used in the regeneration of sg and ag 10 however hcl is a strong and corrosive acid and can gradually dissolve magnetite during multiple washing which can lead to the loss of magnetic property of nfmag after a number of regeneration and reuse 61 62 therefore ethanol an alternative solvent for mb was used in the regeneration of nfmag 63 magnetite is stable in ethanol and nfmag can maintain its magnetic property during elution with ethanol 64 65 the mb removal efficiency after reusing the prepared adsorbents is presented in fig 11 the dye adsorption efficiency showed a decrease from 90 3 cycle 1 to 81 60 cycle 5 and 72 12 cycle 1 to 55 51 cycle 5 for the regenerated sg and ag respectively this could be due to the weight loss of sg and ag during the regeneration process 10 24 however the dye removal efficiency decreases from 81 31 cycle 1 to 79 75 cycle 5 for the regenerated nfmag this result reveals the superior reusability and stability of nfmag over ag and sg this performance is due to the easy and efficient recovery of nfmag by magnetic separation with negligible weight loss the magnetization introduced a promising magnetic separability to the non magnetic ag which has adsorbent losses during separation from the adsorption system additional separation cost energy required for centrifugation and delay in removing adsorbents from treated water however incomplete dye desorption from nfmag may have contributed to the slight decrease in the removal efficiency 4 conclusions this study highlighted the synthesis of graphene by thermal decomposition of waste pet for environmental applications the textural characteristics surface area and pore volume and surface chemistry of the prepared graphene sg were enhanced via koh activation the activated graphene was further modified into a nano ferromagnetic graphene adsorbent nfmag which contained nano sized magnetic iron oxide all prepared adsorbents were characterized by sem tem edx xrd ftir and bet surface analysis a comparative study was set up by testing all three adsorbents for mb decolorization the modification of sg into ag and nfmag reduced the optimal sorption time and increased the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity qm from 216 83 mg g 1 with sg to 348 3 mg g 1 with ag and 291 78 mg g 1 with nfmag at 25 c all mb adsorbent systems followed the langmuir isotherm model and were endothermic and chemisorption towards mb decolorization ftir analysis showed the role of oh cooh and cc functional groups in the mb removal the mb adsorption took place via electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonding and Ï Ï stacking the chemisorption of mb occurred through strong attractive forces between o and coo groups of the adsorbents and mb the adsorption systems rate was controlled by both liquid film and intraparticle diffusion the diffusion of mb molecules by magnetite feo into the inner pores of nfmag contributed to the mb adsorption capability of nfmag nfmag showed excellent reusability due to the ease of magnetic separation thus making its application more economical for large scale operations the findings from this work reveals the potential utilization of waste pet plastics as a cheap

xrd and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy sg ag and nfmag exhibited microporous structures with high surface areas of 391 06 460 01 and 319 62 m2 g 1 respectively sg ag and nfmag were used

reusability of sg ag and nfmag was assessed for five adsorption cycles nfmag exhibited excellent stability and reusability due to its ease of magnetic separation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene activated carbon ferromagnetic composite dye adsorption recycling 1 introduction dyes such as methylene blue mb are chemicals that are widely used in textiles paper bleaching cosmetics and plastics industries 1 current population growth and anthropogenic activities have resulted in an excessive release of dyes containing wastewaters into the natural environment 2 this leads to serious environmental and health issues since dye pollutants are stable resistant to bio degradation toxic carcinogenic and reduce sunlight penetration in water 3 therefore there is an urgent necessity to investigate more efficient cheaper and green technology to thoroughly treat these wastewaters before outdoor discharge 4 recent technologies employed in the treatment of dye polluted wastewaters include electrocoagulation photocatalysis biological treatment membrane separation anodic oxidation nanofiltration ozonation and adsorption 5 11 adsorption technology has some drawbacks such as cost of adsorbents and expensive regeneration process however the high removal efficiency affordability and ease of operation make adsorption technology an attractive choice for numerous water decontamination processes 10 12 13 recent researches are focusing on structural and compositional modification of carbonaceous adsorbents to improve their adsorption properties 14 chemical activation is one of the most interesting carbon modification concepts because activated carbon ac features a high specific surface area and remarkable internal pore structure good mechanical thermal and chemical stability high adsorption capacity high surface reactivity high availability low cost flexibility eco friendly application and ease of regeneration 4 chemical activation involves the enhancement of the surface chemistry of the materials by interactions with salts acids and bases 11 magnetization of carbon using metal compounds such as iron fe cobalt co and nickel ni oxides and salts is another fascinating adsorbents modification phenomenon 15 16 ferromagnetic compounds especially magnetite fe3o4 are suitable supportive materials for carbon because they can be easily controlled and remove from the adsorbate solution by an external magnet without filtration or centrifugation 17 18 this saves time and reduces the rate of sorbent loss during regeneration 17 19 other benefits of magnetic composite adsorbents include minimization of secondary pollution high efficiency and low material and energy cost 18 20 amongst several techniques to synthesize magnetic carbon the co precipitation method was employed in this work due to its advantages such as separation of nucleation and slow growth of nuclei resulting in uniform particle size of the product 21 iron oxides are the most widely used materials for adsorbent magnetization because they have a strong magnetic response are biocompatible resourceful and are easy to use 22 moreover iron is one of the most abundant elements readily available and relatively cheaper for enhancing the efficiency of adsorbents 23 the adsorption property of magnetic carbon materials has been widely studied for the elimination of both inorganic and organic contaminants from waters 24 25 magnetic functionalized carbons may have lesser surface area because of the filling of carbon pores by iron however higher adsorption capacities can be achieved depending on the chemical interaction between the sorbent surface and the pollutant 17 24 on the other hand plastics are an integral part of the modern economy due to their characteristics and low cost contrarily due to their unique features such as stability and resistance to many chemicals plastics tend to remain in the environment for decades without undergoing natural degradation 26 this has led to severe environmental impacts since most plastic wastes are not properly managed 26 polyethylene terephthalate pet is the third largest non fiber plastic making up 10 of total plastic production pet pe and pp make up 42 of all non fiber plastics that have short one time use thus their high amounts in municipal waste 26 28 meanwhile the need to investigate inexpensive and suitable materials as carbonaceous adsorbent precursors remains paramount in current technology 29 these precursors must contain low inorganic impurities with high carbon and volatile content and must be readily available 29 30 pet contains predominantly carbon and some amount of hydrogen 28 pet also contains less to no impurities making it an excellent candidate for numerous upcycling 31 several studies have demonstrated the possible direct recycling of waste plastics such as metallurgical reduction or upgrade of ores 32 33 other studies also illustrated the potential of converting waste pet into other valuable materials such as liquid and gaseous fuels and carbon materials such as carbon microspheres carbon nanoparticles and activated carbon 34 37 in this study pet waste is selected as a cheap feedstock for graphene synthesis as well as providing a green and sustainable solution to environmental problems caused by waste plastics the graphene is modified into activated and nano ferromagnetic functionalized graphene composite to enhance its properties for mb removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents empty pet water bottles

at 600 c for 1 h 38 the system was afterward left to cool overnight the graphene synthesis is illustrated in fig s1a c the dark product sg was collected and milled using retsch pm 400 planetary ball mill for 5 min to under 425 Î¼m sizes and then stored in a desiccator the yield of sg was calculated as follows 1 yield dry weight of sg dry weight of pet precursor 100 sg was impregnated with 50 koh at a ratio of 1 1 wt wt in distilled water and the mixture was stirred at 100 rpm for 3 h and left overnight the resultant uniform mixture was left to dry at 110 c for 4 h the dried sample was activated in a muffle furnace with heating rate of 27 c min 1 under nitrogen gas flow 100 ml h 1 at 600 c the activation temperature was maintained for 1 h before cooling under nitrogen flow after cooling the activated graphene labelled as ag was washed with 0 2 m hcl and then deionized water till neutral ph to remove residual naoh and other inorganic activation by products such as alkaline carbonates finally ag was dried at 120 c for 2 h and then kept in a pyrex desiccator the percent yield was calculated using the relation 2 yield dry weight of ag dry weight of pet precursor 100 3 g of fecl2 4h2o and 3 g of fecl3 were dissolved in a synthetic solution of 100 ml deionized water and 50 ml ethanol co solvent under stirring 3 g of ag was introduced on to the synthetic solution with continuous stirring at 500 rpm for 3 h 1 m naoh was then added dropwise to the mixture until a ph of 8 1 m nabh4 was added in drops to the resultant mixture till the formation of a black precipitate the precipitate was vacuum filtered and thoroughly washed with ethanol and distilled water several times and then dried at 110 c for 2 h the dried cake labelled nfmag was crushed and kept in a desiccator nfmag was readily attracted by an external magnet as shown in fig s1d and maintained its magnetic property after it was applied in the water treatment fig s1e 2 3 characterization techniques the prepared materials were characterized using different analytical techniques the surface morphology of the prepared adsorbents was examined using sem jeol jsm 6010lv japan tem equipped with edx jeol jem 2100f japan was used to obtain high resolution images for studying the structure and elemental composition of the prepared adsorbents crystallographic information about the prepared adsorbents was obtained from powder xrd bruker d2 phaser the surface functional groups of the prepared adsorbents before and after mb adsorption were determined by ftir shimadzu 8400s japan average pore size total pore volume bet surface area and pore distribution of the prepared adsorbents were analyzed using microtrac mrb belsorp mini x japan the samples were degassed at 180 c overnight before the analysis 2 4 point of zero charge phpzc 0 15 g of sg ag and nfmag were separately mixed with 50 ml of 0 1 m of nacl and adjusting the solution ph between 2 and 12 using diluted naoh and 0 1 m of hcl equilibration was achieved by shaking in a thermostatic bath for 24 h at 25 c the dispersions were filtered and the relation between final and initial ph was plotted 2 5 adsorption tests to

systems were stirred at 500 rpm all ph measurements were adjusted using a digital ph meter jenway 370 ph meter u k after a specific time of adsorption the product was centrifuged for 10 min at 6000 rpm the concentration of mb was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer jasco v 630 spectrophotometer japan at a wavelength of 664 nm the amount of mb adsorbed from the simulated wastewater unto sg ag and nfmag were determined using the following formulas 39 3 q e c 0 c e m v 4 q t c 0 c t m v 5 r c 0 c t c 0 100 where qe and qt are the amount of dye adsorbed per weight unit of adsorbent at

solution l and removal efficiency respectively 2 6 adsorption isotherms the langmuir isotherm model describes the adsorption as a monolayer deposition of adsorbate on the adsorbent s surface 39 the

surface energy was assumed by the freundlich isotherm model the freundlich isotherm formula can be simplified into a linear equation as shown in eq 8 and a plot of in qe against in ce was used to compute the model parameters 39 8 ln q e ln k f 1 n f ln c e where kf mg g 1 is a constant and a function of the energy of adsorption and temperature the slope 1 nf ranging between 0 and 1 measures the surface heterogeneity or sorption intensity 41 2 7 kinetics and mechanism of dye adsorption the adsorption kinetic and mechanism models were examined for mb dye sorption with sg ag and nfmag at various initial concentrations 50 100 150 and 200 mg l 1 the pseudo first order eq 9 pseudo second order models eqs 10 12 intraparticle diffusion model eq 13 and liquid film diffusion eq 12 were used to establish the adsorption kinetics and mechanism of mb onto sg ag and nfmag using the respective modeling relations 39 42 9 in q â q t in q e k 1 t 10 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t 11 h k 2 q e 2 12 t

enthalpy change 2 9 regeneration of spent sg ag and nfmag sg and ag loaded with dye were separated from the mb solution by filtration and centrifugation while nfmag was separated using an external magnet and were washed with deionized water then sg and ag were dispersed in 50 ml 0 1 m hcl at 500 rpm for 90 min after elution sg and ag were separated from the resultant solution by filtration the adsorbents were then soaked in distilled water and left overnight sg and ag were afterward separated by filtration and dried at 110 c for 1 h the dye loaded nfmag was mixed with 50 ml of ethanol water 1 1 solution and stirred at 500 rpm for 1 h afterward nfmag was separated by an external magnet washed with distilled water and dried at 110 c for 1 h the dried regenerated adsorbents were reused in 5 cycles of mb adsorption and the removal efficiency was computed after each cycle 3 results and discussion 3 1 yield of sg and ag in the thermal decomposition of pet it is well established that pet degrades to release gaseous hydrocarbons and further break down ch and cc bonds to form solid carbon c 35 sg yielded 21 84 of the pet precursor this is due to some gaseous hydrocarbons hydrogen and water vapour that remain during the thermal decomposition however these gases and vapour serve as reducing agents keeping the carbon in the solid form 38 43 meanwhile the yield of ag was 18 77 of the pet precursor 86 of sg koh is a strong stable and corrosive base that is even a stronger caustic base at elevated temperatures and thus can react with quite inert carbon materials 42 therefore the further reduction in the yield resulted from the elimination and dehydration reactions by koh and the breakdown of coc ch and cc bonds 44 the activation process is a solid liquid redox reaction where hydroxides are transformed into hydrogen alkaline metals and alkaline carbonate due to carbon precursor oxidation as shown in eq 18 45 18 6 koh 2 c 2 k 3 h 2 2 k 2 co 3 3 2 characteristics of sg ag and nfmag 3 2 1 morphological structure of prepared adsorbents sem and tem micrographs of all prepared adsorbents are shown in fig 1a c and e f respectively for sg the sem micrograph reveals a blend of blocky and fibrous morphologies fig 1a the sharp edged blocky structures have smooth surfaces with varying sizes 0 3 Î¼m and shapes which suggest a continuous consumption of material due to activation of the exterior and interior of sg 46 tem image of sg shows transparent sheets with shadows depicting the agglomeration of graphene sheets fig 1d meanwhile the sem micrograph of ag depicts the effects of the reaction between sg and koh as seen in the corrosion of several surfaces and the size reduction of the blocky sg morphology 0 1 Î¼m with uniformly distributed nano perforations fig 1b tem image of ag reveals rippled and entangled layers of graphene fig 1e dark portions suggest some deposit of graphite in ag however nfmag exhibits a rough morphological structure due to the dispersion of feo nanoparticles on the ag matrix fig 1c the feo nanoparticles disperse on all surfaces of nfmag thus occupying the cavities in the precursor ag from the tem micrograph fig 1f the nano feo appears as non uniform sized near spheres with diameters ranging from 10 to 52 nm the retaining of the nanometric dimensionality of the nano feo reveals the excellent support provided by ag during the magnetization process without agglomerating feo 24 the dark portions reveal deposits of the precursor graphene fig 1f 3 2 2 textural properties of prepared adsorbent the bet surface area mean pore diameter and total pore volume of sg ag and nfmag are given in table 1 the n2 adsorption by sg ag and nfmag fig s2a shows stabilized and limited adsorption at high relative pressure which denotes type 1 or langmuir isotherm according to iupac classification and a dominated microporous morphology of all adsorbents 45 the pore distribution of the prepared adsorbents as illustrated in fig s2b confirms the dominance of micropores with the effective pore diameter around 2 nm koh activation of sg increased the pore volume and bet surface area in ag with a slight increase in the mean pore diameter the reaction between koh and sg resulted in the release of volatile components which contributed to the improvement in the textural property of ag 10 moreover alkaline activation produces additional pores due to the redox reactions and oxidative modifications that resulted in the creation of the microporous ag and caused the deterioration and separation of the graphite layers 10 the high pore volume observed in ag can be further attributed to the increase in the number of pores due to the arrangement of carbon layers during the activation process 11 meanwhile the decrease in surface area and pore volume of nfmag is ascribed to the filling and distribution of iron oxides over the precursor ag surface 3 2 3 elemental analysis of sg ag and nfmag the thermal decomposition of waste pet produced a high purity carbon material containing 96 52 wt carbon and 1 79 wt oxygen with traces of silicon fig s3a ag is composed mainly of 73 02 wt carbon and 20 32 wt oxygen with limited amount of silicon fig s3b this increase in oxygen content in ag confirms the success of koh activation by the addition of oxygen groups as seen in the ftir spectra nfmag is made up of 23 77 wt carbon 17 07 wt oxygen and 65 45 wt iron fig s3c this suggests the successful ferro magnetization of ag to form nfmag 3 2 4 structural and crystallographic analysis sg has x ray diffraction peaks at 24 28 and 43 81 2Î¸ which are corresponded to the 002 and 101 planes of graphene respectively fig 2 jcpds card no 87 1526 the broadness of the 002 peak and interlinear spacing of 3 66 Ã¥ is characteristic of amorphous graphene which typically has wider interlinear spacing between the graphene sheets than that of crystalline graphite 3 44 3 55 Ã¥ 38 the amorphous nature of sg is attributed to the termination of sp2 bonds of carbon atoms or intercalation of the hexagonal planar units by oxygen thus disrupting any order in the graphitic plane 38 47 the 101 peak depicts stacks of parallel two dimensional graphene layers and firmly bound hybridized carbon atoms stacked in a translational sequence in hexagonal rings 47 similar but relatively weaker peaks of the graphitic planes at 2Î¸ value of 24 19 and 43 50 with interlinear spacing of 3 68 Ã¥ are observed in ag fig 2 x ray diffractogram of nfmag shows a flattening of the 002 graphitic peak and complete disappearance of the 101 graphitic peak while new peaks of iron oxide emerge the new peaks at 30 19 35 32 42 88 55 4 57 2 and 62 54 fig 2 corresponds to 202 311 400 422 511 and 440 reflection planes of magnetite fe3o4 respectively jcpds card no 19 0629 confirming the successful magnetization of the carbon material 3 2 5 ftir analysis before and after adsorption the existence of surface functional groups in sg ag and nfmag were identified before adsorption of mb dye by their respective ftir molecular vibrations as shown in fig 3a the peak at 1634 cm 1 is due to the cc stretching of aromatic rings which is an intrinsic characteristic of sp2 graphitic carbon that is evident in sg ag and nfmag 10 however the peak at 3433 cm 1 in all prepared materials is attributed to the oh stretching vibration due to the presence of molecular hydrogen bond of polymeric compounds such as alcohols carboxylic acids and phenols and lattice water the intensity of this free hydroxyl group peak increased after koh impregnation in ag and nfmag indicating the interaction between koh and sg surface the 2932 2366 1442 and 1055 cm 1 peaks in the prepared materials are ascribed to ch cooh co and co vibration respectively the ch groups of uniform and ununiformed stretching vibrations of methane groups confirm the removal of hydrogen during the pyrolysis of pet and koh activation 10 regarding nfmag it can be attributed to the ch bond formation during borohydride reduction 24 the peak at 650 cm 1 is attributed to out of plane angular deformation of aromatic rings in sg and ag meanwhile the unique strong peak at 600 cm 1 is characteristic of the feo bond stretching vibrations of fe3o4 in nfmag 17 24 this confirms the effective magnetization of ag via the impregnation of feo on its surface to form nfmag the oh cooh and feo groups are hydrophilic and favour effective dispersion of adsorbents in water while hydrophobic groups like cc increases the binding affinity towards contaminants 24 furthermore the adsorption mechanism of mb can be described by changes in ir spectra of adsorbents after adsorption as shown in fig 3b relevant and discrete modifications in ftir spectra of sg ag and nfmag occurred after mb adsorption as observed by the shifts of peaks changes in peak intensities the emergence of new characteristic peaks and the disappearance of initial peaks the initial peak at 3433 cm 1 of oh groups in all prepared adsorbents shifted and split into 3837 3737 cm 1 and the intensity reduced after adsorption this indicates that the mb molecules adsorption onto the adsorbents surface occurred by displacement of physically adsorbed water molecules 10 24 this further suggests that the mb adsorption occurred via hydrogen bonding between the adsorbents oh groups and the nh group in mb or via electrostatic attraction between deprotonated oh groups and nh of mb the peak at 2366 cm 1 shifted to 2336 cm 1 and became more intense after mb adsorption indicating a possible interaction between the nh and ch of mb molecules and the cooh in all the prepared adsorbents therefore the adsorption of mb by all the prepared adsorbent is favoured at higher ph medium where oh and cooh groups deprotonates rapidly to form o and coo which has a strong affinity and electrostatic attraction towards the nh of mb dye 15 48 the peak at 1634 cm 1 of cc groups in all adsorbents shifted to a higher wavelength at 1695 cm 1 with an increase in intensity mb molecules consists of cc bonds and have Ï electrons which interact with the Ï electrons of benzene rings existing in the prepared graphene based adsorbents through Ï Ï electron stacking 15 49 50 the new peak at 3608 cm 1 in all adsorbents is due to the bending vibration of the csc group of mb 51 52 the initial peak at 2932 cm 1 of ch group completely disappeared after mb adsorption elucidating possible oxidation of the functional group during the adsorption process the 1442 cm 1 peak shifted to 1521 cm 1 due to asymmetric stretching of cs cn and nh vibrations of mb dye 52 the peak at 1055 cm 1 of co shifted to 1035 cm 1 due to interactions with cs groups of mb 52 the shift of the initial 650 cm 1 peak to 673 cm 1 and the new 777 cm 1 peak are due to the wagging vibration of ch in the alkyl group and aromatic ring of mb 52 the distinct changes that occurred in the ftir peaks of oh cc cooh and co suggest that these surface functional groups of the prepared adsorbents can link and interact effectively with mb in solution and the adsorption process is favoured by interaction between mb and sg ag and nfmag surface charges 10 45 46 meanwhile the feo peak shifted from 600 cm 1 to 575 cm 1 in mb loaded nfmag that was utterly absent in sg and ag this reveals the possible involvement of the iron oxides nanoparticles in assisting mb diffusion into nfmag pores 50 a schematic diagram of the possible mb adsorption mechanism was proposed to illustrate the interactions between mb and the major functional groups as shown in fig 4 3 2 6 point of zero charge phpzc ac is an amphoteric material thus can be either positive or negative charged depending on the solution ph the ph at which the adsorbent surface exhibits zero net charge and electrically neutral is defined as phpzc 10 the phpzc of sg ag and nfmag was determined as 6 7 6 56 and 6 13 respectively the decrease in the phpzc of ag is due to its abundant oxygen functional groups such as the oh groups the further decrease of phpzc in nfmag can be attributed to the extra surface oxygen content donated by the iron oxides 10 50 cationic dye adsorption is favoured at ph phpzc where the surface of adsorbents are deprotonated 11 since the mb solution has a ph of 7 the modification of sg into ag and nfmag can impact positively on the removal of mb dye solution ph phpzc values of ag and nfmag 11 3 3 adsorption studies mb as shown in fig s4 dissolves in an aqueous medium to release c16h18n3s mb and cl ions 10 the adsorption of mb can take place via the motion of mb dye from the solution to the adsorbents surface interaction between adsorbate and adsorbents surface functional groups and diffusion of mb dye through the boundary layer to the adsorbents surface 53 these mechanisms form the basis for explaining the adsorption process 3 3 1 effect of contact time fig 5 shows mb adsorption qt behaviour which is rapid at the initial stages with all adsorbents due to high availability of active sites and then became steady and constant over a period as the adsorptive sites become filled since mb is a planar molecule mb was instantly adsorbed through Ï Ï electron donor acceptor between the aromatic backbone of mb and the graphene plane of the prepared adsorbents 50 54 adsorption equilibrium was achieved after 50 30 and 40 min for sg ag and nfmag respectively with respective equilibrium adsorption capacity qe of 172 73 243 93 and 218 79 mg g 1 respectively these equilibrium durations were maintained for subsequent tests with the respective adsorbents it is evident that the chemical activation of sg significantly improved the adsorption capacity of ag and nfmag this improvement is directly associated with the increase in surface area in ag thus increasing the available sites for dye adsorption moreover the more oxygen functionalized surface of ag and nfmag interacted effectively with the cationic mb molecules as demonstrated in the ftir analysis meanwhile the slight decrease in mb adsorption with nfmag compared to its precursor ag is ascribed to the blockage of some pores due to filling with fe3o4 as seen in the slight decrease in pore volume and surface area moreover aggregation of nfmag magnetic attraction between fe3o4 c adsorbents may reduce the total effective surface area of adsorbents and increases the diffusion pathlength thus reducing the sorption capacity as compared with ag 24 however magnetite has low phpzc and quickly becomes negatively charged fe o at ph 7 50 this assists mb molecules diffusion to the pores through electrostatic interactions 50 therefore magnetite played a significant role in the high mb sorption density within the pores of nfmag thence the better sorption capacity of nfmag than sg despite the reduction of its surface area and pore volume 50 3 3 2 effect of initial dye concentration with increasing initial mb dye concentration the amount of adsorbed dye qt increased as illustrated in fig 6 the mb sorption capacity of sg ag and nfmag increased from 122 7 213 6 and 193 6 mg g 1 respectively at mb concentration of 50 mg l 1 to 195 8 330 3 and 281 8 mg g 1 respectively at mb concentration of 50 200 mg l 1 the increasing mass transfer driving force due to increasing dye concentration enhanced the chances and number of collisions between mb molecules and the surface of the adsorbent this increase in mass transfer occurs from the solution phase to the solid phase at the initial adsorption period 11 meanwhile adsorption efficiencies of sg ag and nfmag decreased with increasing mb dye concentration this can be attributed to the forces of repulsion between the dye molecules in the adsorbents surface and the bulk phase after the initial rapid adsorption 10 moreover the ratio of the available binding sites to the initial dye concentration is higher at lower dye concentrations thus resulting in the possibility of complete mb sorption however at higher initial dye concentration the ratio becomes lower and there is rapid saturation of the adsorption sites which after a while hinders the movement of additional mb dye towards the adsorbents surface due to the increasing repulsive forces between the adsorbate and the remaining dye stuff 17 3 3 3 effect of adsorbent dosage the mb adsorption efficiency was enhanced with increasing dosage of all adsorbents as shown in fig 7 increasing the dose of adsorbent increases the contact between the dye and adsorbent surface due to the greater availability of active adsorption sites by the increase in total surface area and number of binding sites 41 moreover since the width of the mb molecules is 1 45 nm increasing adsorbent dose increases the number of pores available for mb sorption via pore filling 51 however the equilibrium amount of mb dye adsorbed qe reduced with increasing adsorbent dose aggregation of particles saturated the adsorption sites reducing the total effective surface area of adsorbents and increasing their diffusional pathlength 46 55 this in turn decreases the sorption capacity from fig 7 the maximum adsorption capacity was attained at a dose of 0 2 mg ml 1 for all adsorbents therefore 0 2 mg ml 1 of prepared adsorbents was selected as the optimum dose for subsequent experiments 3 3 4 effect of initial ph of mb solution the effect of initial solution ph on the mb removal efficiency was investigated at a ph range of 2 12 as shown in fig 8 the mb removal efficiency was enhanced by increasing mb solution ph for all three adsorbents in acidic conditions low ph the surface of the prepared adsorbents becomes positively charged due to the protonation of the functional groups on the surface of the adsorbent 10 this hinders mb adsorption due to the electrostatic repulsive forces between the positively charge adsorbent surface and cationic mb 10 46 moreover in such acidic conditions the concentration of protons is high and can strongly compete with the cationic mb ions for uptake by adsorptive sites 52 as the mb solution ph increases basic conditions deprotonation of surface functional groups such as oh and cooh groups occurs and the surface of the prepared adsorbent becomes negatively charged 10 this enhances the electrostatic attraction between the cationic mb molecules and the anionic sites of all prepared adsorbents which thence improves the adsorption capacity from fig 8 the optimum mb solution ph with sg is 12 however since no substantial increase in adsorption was observed from ph 10 to 12 with ag and nfmag ph 10 is selected as the optimum ph for mb removal with ag and nfmag 3 3 5 effect of mb solution temperature the mb removal efficiency with all prepared adsorbents increased with increasing the solution temperature fig 9 such a trend predicts the existence of strong attractive forces between adsorbents and mb molecules depicting a chemisorption process 41 the temperature adsorption effect is explained by the increase in the rate of diffusion of mb molecules from the solution bulk to the adsorbent surface across the external boundary layer and in the internal pores of the adsorbents temperature rise increases the mobility of mb molecules along with a decrease in thickness of the boundary layer surrounding the adsorbent which consequently decreases the mass transfer resistance of adsorbate in the boundary layer 41 furthermore at high temperatures activation creation of new active sites of the graphene based adsorbents may occur which subsequently facilitates the sorption of mb dye 10 3 4 adsorption potential and mechanism 3 4 1 adsorption isotherm the equilibrium mb adsorption plots of qe against ce for sg ag and nfmag sorption systems at 25 c is presented in fig 10 increasing mb dye concentration led to progressive coverage of the sg ag and nfmag surface indicating saturation due to the filling of the vacant adsorptive sites such progressive adsorption is characteristic of langmuir type adsorption isotherm 56 the model fit of the langmuir isotherm model and freundlich isotherm model are presented in fig s5a b respectively the calculated langmuir and freundlich isotherm parameters are summarized in table 2 according to the r2 values the langmuir models best represented the adsorption data indicating that the adsorption process with all adsorbents occurs in a homogeneous surface with identical energy sites and monolayer coverage adsorbate species 10 39 this indicates that the uptake of mb onto sg ag and nfmag is mainly a chemisorption process 10 the rl values are between 0 and 1 which indicates the favorability of the langmuir adsorption pattern 10 the rl values were reduced with ag and nfmag and this infers that the adsorption process was more effective and more irreversible with the modified graphene adsorbents than the pristine sg however the adsorption was more favoured with ag than nfmag as seen in the lower rl values higher kl values of ag meanwhile the 1 nf values decreased in nfmag and then ag which further implies that stronger interactions transpired between mb and the modified graphene adsorbents than the pristine sg 3 4 2 adsorption kinetics and mechanism the rate and mechanism of mb uptake parameters were estimated by fitting the experimental kinetics data to their respective linear equations the calculated results of the parameters are presented in table 3 the linear regression analysis reveals that the mb sg mb ag and mb nfmag adsorption systems follow the pseudo second order pso with a higher correlation than the pseudo first order pfo model at all mb concentrations moreover the calculated qe qe cal values obtained from the pseudo second order model of all adsorbents are closer to the experimental qe values qe exp than that of pseudo first order this indicates that the adsorption of mb by all prepared adsorbents was chemisorption and depends primarily on the adsorption capacity and not the initial dye concentration and the sorption process can be more stable at high temperatures 17 57 as illustrated in fig 4 the chemisorption of mb by all prepared adsorbents is proposed to have occurred via strong electrostatic interactions between the oxygen functional groups of the adsorbents deprotonated cooh and oh groups and mb meanwhile the high initial sorption rates h and low half life time t1 2 observed in mb ag and mb nfmag reveal that the sorption process after sg modifications became more prompt the intraparticle diffusion model ipd was used to determine the adsorption mechanism as illustrated in fig s6 all mb adsorbent plots exhibit similar trends and the adsorption mechanism is divided into three steps for each curve the first phase involves the adsorption or diffusion in larger pores which occurred at the exterior adsorbent surfaces in nfmag the negatively charged magnetite feo assisted in the diffusion of mb molecules at the exterior surface via electrostatic interactions the second phase is a gradual adsorption step and is controlled by intraparticle diffusion the third phase is the equilibrium step which is the slowest and final step the interaction between the dye molecules and the adsorbent active sites increased the adsorption intensity as the initial dye concentration increased thus the value of the intraparticle diffusion constant kid increased with increasing dye concentration 58 the boundary layer c in sg ag and mb nfmag can be attributed to particles agglomeration meanwhile the graphs of ln 1 qt qe vs t for mb adsorption with all prepared adsorbents fig s7 have higher linear correlation table 3 this shows that the film diffusion model is applicable if liquid film diffusion ldf is the rate control step its plot should be linear with zero intercept 41 however since the linear plots did not pass through the origin the liquid film diffusion model may not be the only rate controlling step consequently the mb dye adsorption kinetics with all prepared adsorbents may be regulated by liquid film diffusion or both intraparticle diffusion and liquid film diffusion the liquid film rate constants klf were between 0 032 and 0 111 min 1 for sg 0 105 0 176 for ag and 0 010 0 086 min 1 for nfmag 3 4 3 adsorption thermodynamics fig s8 presents the thermodynamic fit of mb adsorbent systems and the results of the thermodynamic parameters are summarized in table 4 the values of Î´h are positive and this indicates that the sorption process is endothermic with all adsorbents the negative Î´g values of all mb adsorbent systems reveal the adsorption processes were spontaneous mb sg mb nfmag mb ag increasing spontaneity this affirms the reactivity of ag and nfmag with mb as illustrated by the adsorption kinetics modeling analysis moreover the values of Î´g reduces as temperature increases which indicate that the adsorption processes were more spontaneous at elevated temperatures 59 the positive Î´s values imply an intensified degree of randomness in the solid and solution interface during the adsorption process 2 59 the positive Î´s values also confirms that the sorption process was a solvent replacement phenomenon where the dye molecules replace water molecules on the adsorbents surface to effect adsorption 60 3 5 reusability of spent adsorbents hcl is an effective solvent for desorbing methylene blue mb and was used in the regeneration of sg and ag 10 however hcl is a strong and corrosive acid and can gradually dissolve magnetite during multiple washing which can lead to the loss of magnetic property of nfmag after a number of regeneration and reuse 61 62 therefore ethanol an alternative solvent for mb was used in the regeneration of nfmag 63 magnetite is stable in ethanol and nfmag can maintain its magnetic property during elution with ethanol 64 65 the mb removal efficiency after reusing the prepared adsorbents is presented in fig 11 the dye adsorption efficiency showed a decrease from 90 3 cycle 1 to 81 60 cycle 5 and 72 12 cycle 1 to 55 51 cycle 5 for the regenerated sg and ag respectively this could be due to the weight loss of sg and ag during the regeneration process 10 24 however the dye removal efficiency decreases from 81 31 cycle 1 to 79 75 cycle 5 for the regenerated nfmag this result reveals the superior reusability and stability of nfmag over ag and sg this performance is due to the easy and efficient recovery of nfmag by magnetic separation with negligible weight loss the magnetization introduced a promising magnetic separability to the non magnetic ag which has adsorbent losses during separation from the adsorption system additional separation cost energy required for centrifugation and delay in removing adsorbents from treated water however incomplete dye desorption from nfmag may have contributed to the slight decrease in the removal efficiency 4 conclusions this study highlighted the synthesis of graphene by thermal decomposition of waste pet for environmental applications the textural characteristics surface area and pore volume and surface chemistry of the prepared graphene sg were enhanced via koh activation the activated graphene was further modified into a nano ferromagnetic graphene adsorbent nfmag which contained nano sized magnetic iron oxide all prepared adsorbents were characterized by sem tem edx xrd ftir and bet surface analysis a

13203,poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf has been widely implemented in fabricating membranes but pure pvdf membrane need to be modified by blending or copolymerization to cope with its weak alkali resistance in this work the function of chlorotrifluoroethylene ctfe chain segment was studied pvdf ectfe blending membranes and poly vinylidene difluoride co chlorotrifluoroethylene pvdf ctfe

chlorotrifluoroethylene pvdf ctfe non solvent induced phase separation nips surface and sublayer microporous structure ultrafiltration performance alkali resistance 1 introduction nowadays the demand for fresh water continues to grow with the development of productivity and the protection and utilization of water resources catch public attention however the traditional operations for treating water will inevitably produce a large number of industrial and domestic wastewater 1 2 if it is not properly treated before discharge it will aggravate the water shortage and endanger the natural environment 3 membrane separation technology as the representative of the modern sewage treatment process is thought to effectively alleviate the problem 4 5 this technology is driven by the difference of pressure potential or concentration using functional membrane components to separate the water and pollutants in the feed liquid its advantages of less secondary pollution low energy consumption and high working efficiency are due to the absence of physical and chemical reactions in the separation process 6 8 its separation performance is mainly affected by the membrane material and its structure common polymers such as polyamide pa polyether sulfone pes and polyvinyl chloride pvc have been prepared as membranes and used in wastewater treatment among them polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane has accounted for a large proportion 9 13 the structural unit of pvdf is ch2 cf2 meaning the molecular chain is protected by fluorine atoms with low polarity and strong electronegativity and the cf bond 485 kj mol 1 is very strong therefore pvdf exhibits excellent thermal stability mechanical strength and machinability it should also be noted that the intrinsic hydrophobicity of pvdf makes the membrane susceptible to contamination by feed fluids so hydrophilic pore forming agents such as polyethylene glycol peg or polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp are added in the process of preparing pvdf membranes to deal with membrane fouling problems 14 15 additionally alkali washing is regarded as an effective method for mitigating membrane fouling but this process will cause irreversible damage to pvdf membrane due to its intolerance to strong alkali solution 16 18 as a result the service life of the membrane is severely shortened which limits the wide application and further development of pvdf in the membrane field 19 20 in reported studies surface coating modification has been devoted to improve the alkali resistance of pvdf membrane but it is difficult to be applied in practical production 21 22 beyond that the development of new fluoropolymer materials to optimize the performance of membrane matrix has become a research hotspot in recent years for example poly vinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropene pvdf hfp poly vinylidene fluoride co tetrafluoroethylene pvdf tfe poly vinylidene fluoride co trifluorethylene pvdf trfe and poly ethylene chlorotrifluoroethylene ectfe 23 32 as another pvdf based copolymer poly vinylidene difluoride co chlorotrifluoroethylene pvdf ctfe not only has good mechanical properties and thermal stability like other fluoropolymers but also has excellent chemical corrosion resistance due to the presence of trifluoroethylene chloride ctfe chain segment in its molecular chain meanwhile the presence of ccl bond provides an active site for modification hence pvdf ctfe has great application potential in membrane materials field 17 33 35 from the perspective of industrial production non solvent induced phase separation nips is still the best method to prepare fluoropolymer membrane 18 36 37 during the preparation process the liquid film occurs phase inversion in coagulation bath and the polymer rich phase in the casting solution transforms into the membrane matrix and the poor phase becomes the micropores 38 39 in the reported studies on the fabrication membrane by nips method the trade off between the permeability and selectivity of the membrane cannot be broken through adjusting the polymer content causing the change of viscosity of the casting solution 34 36 there are reports on the adjustment of solvents and the effect of solvents on the microporous structure of pvdf membrane surface and sublayer 40 41 however the mutual diffusion of water and solvent is affected not only by the thermodynamic factor the solubility parameters of solvent and polymer but also by the kinetic factor the viscosity of casting solution in this work pvdf ctfe flat sheet membranes were prepared via nips using pvp as pore forming agent and n n dimethylacetamide dmac n n dimethylformamide dmf n methylpyrrolidone nmp as solvent respectively the effect of solvent on the rate of l l de mixing was investigated from thermodynamic factor combined kinetics factor meanwhile pvdf pvdf ectfe hybrid matrix membranes were prepared for comparison the morphology pore structure and physicochemical structure of the membranes with different modification methods as well as different solvents were systematically investigated the membrane performance of alkaline resistance water permeability and ultrafiltration were evaluated and the anti fouling property of the membrane was estimated by the zeta potential analyzer in order to demonstrate its potential in industrial implementation 2 experimental 2 1 materials

ethylene glycol ar 99 0 naoh ar 96 0 and naclo ar 99 0 were purchased from yantai shuangshuang chemical co ltd shandong china 2 2 membrane preparation the pvdf ectfe and pvdf ctfe resins were dried at 50 c for 24 h in advance the membranes were prepared by the schematic diagram as shown in fig 1 first of all an appropriate amount of pre dried polymer solvent and additive were added into the sealed flask and mechanically stirred at 60 c for 12 h until the solutions were homogeneous the homogeneous solutions were then placed in a water bath at 60 c for 12 h to eliminate the air bubbles secondly the polymer solutions were distributed evenly across the surface of clean glass plate by a casting knife with a gap of 150 Î¼m and then immersed in a deionized water coagulating bath room temperature 15 c smoothly for phase inversion and removing the residual solvent and additive off finally the wet membranes were dried in a freeze dryer all these flat sheet membranes in this work were prepared from corresponding composition of polymer solution with the process described above and named as m1 m2 m3 m4 and m5 respectively as listed in table 1 2 3 membrane characterization 2 3 1 casting solution viscosity the viscosity of casting solutions prepared from a different formulation was detected by using a rotary viscometer ndj 5s china the influence of casting solution viscosity on membrane structure in the membrane formation process was studied 2 3 2 membrane morphology the surface and section morphology of the membranes were assessed through using a field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem quanta 250 usa under standard high vacuum conditions of 3 00 kv the membranes were brittle broken in liquid nitrogen which was conducive to obtaining a complete and clear cross section due to the poor electrical conductivity of the polymer the samples were attached to the sample table with conductive adhesive followed by gold coating under vacuum using a vacuum magnetron sputter msp 30t japan the surface states of membranes fabricated by different solvents were investigated by atomic force microscopy afm 5100n japan and the roughness was obtained by scanning probe microscope under tapping mode 2 3 3 pore size distribution the pore size distribution and average pore size of top and bottom surface of prepared membranes were calculated by the software of image pro plus ipp 6 0 usa 42 the pores were distinguished on the membrane surface based on the gray value of each pixel in the fe sem topography 2 3 4 porosity since the membrane porosity could be defined as the proportion of pore volume to the total volume of the membrane it was measured by gravimetric method a small piece of dried membrane was soaked in ethylene glycol for 2 h the residual droplets on the membrane surface were wiped with a filter paper and the weight of wet membrane at room temperature was obtained then the weight of dry membrane was acquired after dried in an oven at 75 c the porosity Îµ was calculated by the following equation 43 1 Îµ m w m d Ï w m w m d Ï w m d Ï d 100 m w is the weight of wet membrane m d is the weight of dry membrane Ï w and Ï d are the density of ethylene glycol 0 81 g cm 3 and polymer density pvdf 1 78 g cm 3 pvdf ctfe 1 78 g cm 3 ectfe 1 68 g cm 3 respectively 17 20 29 2 3 5 physicochemical structure the effects of solvent and additive on the physicochemical structure of different membranes were determined by comparing the infrared spectra the spectra were recorded at a range between 600 cm 1 and 4000 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 in attenuated total reflection atr mode using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir nicolet 5700 usa in general the Î² phase content f Î² of the polymer matrix was calculated by the following equation 43 44 2 f Î² a Î² k Î² k Î± a Î± a Î² 100 where the absorption coefficient k Î± 6 1 104 cm2 mol 1 and k Î² 7 7 104 cm2 mol 1 a Î± and a Î² represent the absorbance of Î± phase 766 cm 1 and Î² phase 840 cm 1 respectively 43 2 3 6 thermal analysis the thermal property of each membrane was examined by a differential scanning calorimeter dsc q100 usa about 5 mg of each membrane was placed into the sample dish and heated from room temperature to 250 c at a rate of 10 c min 1 and the heat flow data were recorded in order to eliminate the influence of pvdf polymorphism on the crystallinity the equation of membrane crystallinity Ï c was shown as follows 43 44 3 Ï c Î´h m x Î´h 100 Î± y Î´h 100 Î² 100 where x and y are the mass fraction of Î± phase and Î² phase crystal respectively Î´h m is recorded as melting enthalpy of polymer the melting enthalpy of Î± phase and Î² phase is Î´h 100 Î± 93 04 j g 1 and Î´h 100 Î² 103 4 j g 1 respectively 44 2 4 water infiltration performance in order to characterize the hydrophilicity of the membranes the contact angle between the top surface of membrane and pure water was measured by fixed droplet method using a video contact angle tester jy 82a china each sample was tested for five times and the average value was recorded as the final result the pure water flux was measured to characterized the infiltration performance of the membranes by the test equipment made by the laboratory as shown in fig 2 each membrane with an effective separation area of 7 54 10 4 m2 was tested for 2 h under the pressure of 0 1 mpa to achieve a stable flux and then the pure water flux j was calculated according to the following equation 4 j v a t where v is the volume of permeate liquid after 10 min operation a is the effective separation area of the membranes t is 10 min and each membrane was tested three times 2 5 mechanical property and alkaline resistance the tensile fracture strength of the membranes was detected by an electronic single fiber strength meter yg001n china the samples were cut to 40 mm in length and 4 mm in width fixed vertically between the fixtures stretched at a constant elongation rate of 10 mm min 1 until broke moreover the membranes were treated with strong alkali solution composed of naoh 40 g l 1 and naclo 4 g l 1 at room temperature for 2 h filtration and 20 days immersion respectively afterwards the tensile fracture strength of them were measured by the above method 16 18 all membranes were tested for five times the average value was obtained as the final result the retention rate Î· 1 2 of the fracture strength was used to assess the alkali resistance of each membrane and the equation was as follows 5 Î· 1 Ï 2 Ï 1 100 6 Î· 2 Ï 3 Ï 1 100 where Ï 1 Ï 2 and Ï 3 are respectively the tensile fracture strength of the membranes before the treatment of the strong alkali solution after the treatment of the filtration and immersion in the strong alkali solution respectively 2 6 ultrafiltration and anti fouling performance the ultrafiltration and anti fouling performance of membranes were evaluated at room temperature by the test equipment made by the laboratory as shown in fig 2 after 30 min of prepressure it was tested under the pressure of 0 1 mpa including three stages the first stage the pure water flux within 2 h was measured and denoted as j w1 the second stage was to filter the bsa solution with the mass concentration of 1 g l 1 the corresponding permeate flux was denoted as j bsa1 then the membrane was rinsed by ultrasonic cleaner for 30 min the pure water flux of the washed membrane was denoted as j w2 at the third stage finally the second and third stages were carried out again and the corresponding flux were denoted as j bsa2 and j w3 45 46 the volume of permeate liquid was recorded every 10 min and the flux including j w and j bsa was calculated according to the following equation 7 j w bsa v w bsa a t where v w and v bsa is the volume of permeate liquid a is the effective separation area of the membranes t is the operation time the flux recovery rate frr was calculated according to pure water flux j w and the equation was shown below 8 frr j w 2 j w 1 100 additionally the membrane fouling parameters including reversible fouling resistance r r irreversible fouling resistance r ir and total fouling resistance r t were calculated using the following equations 9 r r j w 2 j bsa 1 j w 1 100 10 r ir j w 1 j w 2 j w 1 100 11 r t j w 1 j bsa 1 j w 1 100 the equation of bsa rejection rate brr was as follows 12 brr 1 c p c f 100 where cf and c p represent the concentrations of bsa in the feed solution and the permeate solution g l 1 respectively the concentration of bsa was determined by an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv 1100 china with the wavelength of 280 nm in order to evaluate the effect of different solvents on the anti fouling property of membranes the surface charge of the prepared membranes in varying ph were measured by the solid surface zeta potential analyzer surpass austria moreover the charge after the pollution of ha and cleaning were also examined 47 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology of the membranes the surface sem morphology of prepared membranes is shown in fig 3 a and b are the top surface which direct contacted with the coagulating bath and bottom surface which coated on the glass plate respectively it could be seen from the comparison of the top and bottom surfaces the skin layer structure appeared on the top surface of each membrane while obvious pore structure on the bottom surface in the membrane forming process the solvent diffusion rate near the top surface contacting with the non solvent directly was faster than that near the bottom surface which led to the formation of skin layer from the surface morphology especially the bottom surface of the membranes m1 m3 it could be seen that compared with the pvdf membrane m1 the surface pores of the pvdf ectfe membrane m2 and the pvdf ctfe membrane m3 were both substantially increased indicating that the modification by blending and copolymerization were both beneficial to the formation of microporous surface structure the former was mainly due to the decrease in polymer concentration which could be reflected by the sharp decline in viscosity of casting solution as shown in table 2 although the viscosity decrease of the latter was not obvious the introduction of ctfe segments adjusted the mass transfer process in phase conversion as a result the surface microporous structure was increased and evenly distributed in order to optimize the membrane structure of pvdf ctfe modified by copolymerization three different solvents were used to prepare the membrane m3 m4 m5 in the current literature only thermodynamic factor was implemented to explain the effect of different solvents on the rate of liquid liquid l l de mixing 40 41 the solubility parameters and mutual diffusivity of water and solvents was presented in table 3 as can be seen that the mutual diffusion between dmf and water is the largest while that between nmp and water is the smallest demonstrating that using nmp as solvent will slow down the rate of l l de mixing more than that the viscosity of the casting solution also effects the rate of l l de mixing considering the kinetic factor as presented in table 2 the viscosity of casting solution was the lowest when dmf was applied the low kinetic resistance in membrane forming process made the interdiffusion rate between solvent and water faster and the surface microporous structure less in contrast the casting solution viscosity increased dramatically when nmp was used as the solvent contributing to the poor and rich phase movement of the polymer were both hindered combined with the factors of thermodynamic and kinetic in the phase inversion the rate of l l de mixing was controlled and the surface porosity was the highest as shown in fig 4 and table 4 the surface of the membrane m5 appeared microgranular protuberance structure rp and rv are lower than those of the membrane m3 and m4 indicating that the membrane m5 can not only maintain an appropriate contact area with water molecules but also reduce the accumulation of pollutants caused by deep valleys on the surface this was mainly because the similar chemical structure between the solvent nmp and the pore forming agent pvp which allowed the molecular chains of pvdf ctfe to fully stretch verified by the significantly increase of the casting solution viscosity in the process of membrane forming the polymer matrix was affected by induced crystallization to occur the solid liquid s l phase separation and form the microgranular protuberances as can be seen in fig 5 the membranes prepared by nips had typical asymmetric cross section structures consisting of finger like pores with dense skin surface pear shaped microvoids and spongy polymer matrix whose formation were mainly caused by the strong polarity of the solvent and the hydrophilic modification of pvp the l l de mixing played a dominant role in the phase inversion process the non solvent diffused rapidly into the membrane to form a macroporous structure and push the polymer rich phase to the pore wall and bottom surface to obtain a spongy pore structure moreover it could be clearly observed from fig 6 that the prepared membranes had varying finger like pores near the top layer especially the largest number and most uniform size of the membrane m5 demonstrating that it is not only provided more permeability channels for water molecular but also possessed the increasing stability during infiltration this was because the rate of l l de mixing decreased with the increase of casting solution viscosity and the decreased of mutual diffusivity between solvent and water leading to the loose finger like pores near the top layer became more regular 3 2 structure and distribution of micropores in order to visually display the changes of surface micropore structure the software of ipp6 0 was implemented to calculate the pore size distribution and average pore size after processing the surface morphology 34 42 the relevant data and porosity measured by gravimetric method are shown in fig 7 it could be seen that the porosity of all the membranes was higher than 83 which benefited from the microvoids formed after the polymer poor phase was removed by phase inversion according to the average pore size and distribution in fig 7 the copolymerized modified membrane m3 possessed larger surface micropore size than the unmodified membrane m1 and narrower distribution than the blend modified membrane m2 resulting from the smaller viscosity of casting solution as the solvent was changed the surface average pore size of the membrane m4 increased and its distribution widened in comparison with membrane m3 when dmf was used as solvent it could be interpreted as the improvement of the l l de mixing rate similar to the membrane m2 with the increase of phase separation rate the pore size on the membrane surface increased but the number of micropores decreased sharply which was not conducive to the improvement of separation efficiency however when nmp was used as the solvent the opposite phenomenon appeared the number of micropores in the membrane m5 increased significantly the pore size became smaller and the distribution became narrower it thanked to the synergistic effect of the pore forming agent pvp and the solvent nmp promoted the s l de mixing process 43 44 it meant that pvdf ctfe membrane with superior micropore structure could be obtained by using nmp as the solvent compared with dmac and dmf 3 3 physicochemical structure of polymer matrix in this work the physicochemical structure and crystallization property of prepared membranes were analyzed by ftir and dsc the ftir spectra of the membranes m1 m5 and a pvdf membrane prepared without pvp are shown in fig 8 therein a is the full spectrum with wavelengths ranging from 3000 to 700 cm 1 and b is the partial spectrum with characteristic absorption peaks at 1400 1179 1067 973 876 840 799 and 766 cm 1 it could be seen from fig 8 a that with the addition of pvp the characteristic absorption peaks of co and cn bonds appeared at 1676 and 1275 cm 1 for the membranes m1 m5 17 48 that was because as a water soluble macromolecule additive although most of pvp was rinsed off in the membrane forming process some of its molecular chains were physically entangled with the molecular chains of pvdf or pvdf ctfe during the casting solution preparation coupled with the hydrogen bonding between co of pvp and ch of the polymer matrix resulting in partial residue of pvp and modification of prepared membranes besides a detailed analysis of the ftir spectrum as shown in fig 8b exhibited that the polymer matrix crystallized from Î± phase to Î² phase with the addition of pvp by comparing changes in characteristic peaks at 766 799 876 and 973 cm 1 derived from Î± phase polymorph and 840 1067 1179 and 1400 cm 1 derived from Î² phase polymorph 49 51 in order to further analyze the influence of different modification methods and solvents on the crystalline properties of prepared membranes the content of Î² phase was calculated according to the absorption intensity of the peaks at 766 cm 1 Î± phase and 840 cm 1 Î² phase together with the data of melting point and crystallinity acquired from dsc they are listed in table 5 as shown in table 5 the Î² phase content and crystallinity of the blend modified membrane m2 were both reduced according to the report the Î² phase of pvdf based polymer was a thermodynamically stable phase with an all trans conformation its growth would be inhibited by high phase inversion rate 43 44 the decrease in the casting solution viscosity of the membrane m2 resulted in the acceleration of the phase inversion rate ultimately inhibited the growth of Î² phase crystal meanwhile the melting point of the copolymerization modified membrane m3 decreased with the decrease of crystallinity this was because the regularity of the pvdf molecular chains was destroyed after the ctfe segments were introduced into the vdf segments thereby their crystallization performance was negatively affected when dmf was used as solvent the rate of l l de mixing was accelerated due to the factors of thermodynamics and kinetics during the phase inversion the membrane m4 showed lower crystallinity and melting point than m3 in contrast the rate of l l de mixing decreased significantly using nmp as solvent the content of Î² phase crystal increased caused an increase in crystallinity and was reflected in an increase in the melting point of the membrane m5 demonstrating that nmp improved the crystallization property and thermal stability of pvdf ctfe membrane 3 4 mechanical properties and alkali resistance the influence of modification methods and solvents on mechanical properties and alkali resistance of prepared membranes were discussed the tensile strength as well as the strength retention rate Î· 1 2 and after the treatment of strong alkali solution were displayed in fig 9 as presented in fig 9 after the treatment of filtration or immersion the tensile strength of the modified membranes both decreased due to the increase of the overall porosity when the pvdf ctfe membrane prepared using dmf as solvent its strength decreased due to the stress concentration phenomenon that was more likely to occur which was affected by the wide surface pore size distribution the increase in the number of micropores on the membrane surface also resulted in a decrease in the strength of pvdf ctfe membrane when nmp was used as solvent the strength retention rates of unmodified pvdf membrane m1 after filtration or immersion in strong alkali solution were 78 and 59 respectively it was because the molecular chains of pvdf formed cc bonds under the dehydrofluorination of alkaline solution the linkage isomerism of head to head and tail to tail in the molecular chains led to the appearance of conjugated system cccc and finally caused the degradation of pvdf 52 the slight improvement of alkali resistance of the membrane m2 was mainly benefit from the ectfe which possessed better chemical inertia however the irregular surface and sublayer micropore structure of membrane m2 collapsed after treatment resulting in the retention rate of filtration and immersion were only 82 and 76 respectively in particular the introduction of ctfe segments into the vdf molecular chains reduced the possibility of conjugated system after dehydrofluorine in alkali solution 53 moreover the ccl bond would give priority to the dehydrochlorine reaction which played a protective role in the vdf enriched segments 16 18 as shown in the degradation schematic of fig 10 therefore the retention rate of pvdf ctfe membranes separately maintained about 90 and 80 after different treatment it is worth noting that the retention rate of membrane m5 maintain at 98 after filtration of alkali solution due to the regular micropore structure showing excellent chemical resistance 3 5 water permeability of the membranes the water permeability of membrane is influenced by the micropore structure providing the permeation channel and surface hydrophilicity reflecting the permeation pressure 48 53 in order to evaluate the water permeability of prepared membranes the static water contact angle of the separation layer top surface and the pure water flux under the circulating water pressure of 0 1 mpa were measured the results are shown in fig 11 as exhibited in fig 11 the employment of hydrophilic additive pvp partly improved the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface in view of the intrinsic hydrophobicity of pvdf based resin 35 39 all the contact angle were below 75 it was also proved that the appearance of co and cn bonds in the ftir spectrum fig 8a was the residue after the chain entanglement of pvp macromolecule and polymer molecule the membrane crystallinity reduced with the decrease of pvdf content and at the same time the porosity of the membrane increased which leads to an increase in water flux beyond that the loose spherulite structure and the hydrophilic Î² phase are conducive to the reduction of water permeability resistance 34 54 although the contact angle increased due to the introduction of high hydrophobic ectfe resin the larger micropores and higher porosity resulted in the maximum pure water flux of the membrane m2 for the copolymerization modification the introduction of ctfe chain segments reduced the structure regularity of polymer molecular chains increased the roughness of membrane surface and further improved its hydrophilicity especially the membrane m5 prepared by using nmp as solvent had the smallest contact angle and its pure water flux reached 306 5 l m 2 h 1 3 6 dynamic anti fouling and ultrafiltration performance to determine the anti fouling and ultrafiltration performance of prepared membranes a three step filtration test was applied pure water bsa solution pure water with two cycles in this work 45 46 the time dependent permeation fluxes of the membranes were shown in fig 12 the flux recovery ratio and fouling resistance was calculated by the stable flux data to reflect the anti fouling performance of prepared membranes and the bsa rejection ratio was measured to study the ultrafiltration performance as shown in fig 13 in order to evaluate the effect of different solvents on the membrane anti fouling performance the surface zeta potential of membranes m3 m4 and m5 was estimated as presented in fig 14 it could be seen from fig 12 that the permeation flux of each membrane decreased and gradually stabilized with the increase of operating time at every testing cycle compared with pvdf matrix membranes m1 m2 the flux attenuation of pvdf ctfe membrane was smaller indicating that the introduction of ctfe chain segments increased the pressure resistance of polymer matrix phase in each bsa solution testing the flux was significantly lower than that of pure water due to the aggregation of protein molecules demonstrating that the bsa could be effectively rejected by the prepared membranes combined with fig 13 a the separation efficiency of all prepared membranes decreased after two cycle testing on the one hand a part of the membrane pore structure was broken by ultrasonic cleaning the collapse of sublayer pore structure reduced the water transport channel and the fracture of surface pore decreased the rejection ratio on the other hand the membrane was polluted by intrusion of bsa it is worth noting that the water flux of membrane m5 was the largest after two cycles and the bsa rejection ratio was still maintained at about 90 after ultrasonic cleaning the reason is that its regular surface and sublayer micropore structure provide a stable transport channel and narrowest pore distribution indicating that membrane m5 possessed excellent ultrafiltration performance as presented in fig 13 the frr and r r of all the prepared membranes reduced in the second cycle due to the aggravation of membrane fouling the improved hydrophilicity of the membranes is conducive to the construction of a dense nano water layer on its surface during the separation process thus enhancing the removal of pollutants moreover the regular surface microporous structure can prevent pollutants from invading into the inner membrane and causing irreversible fouling therefore the frr and r r of membrane m5 decreased slightly compared with other membranes in general the surface zeta potential of membrane will change with the attachment of pollutants and the membrane surface with strong electronegativity has better resistance to electronegative pollutants under the action of electrostatic force 47 it can be seen from the fig 14 the membrane m5 possessed the strongest electronegativity and the potential after cleaning was close to the original in summary the anti fouling and ultrafiltration performance of membrane m5 are excellent and stable 4 conclusion in this work the pvdf pvdf ectfe and pvdf ctfe membranes were prepared via the nips method using dmac as solvent and pvp as pore forming additive different solvents dmf nmp were selected to regulate the structure of pvdf ctfe membranes the addition of high chemically inert ectfe resin in the blending membrane partly improved the permeability and alkali resistance of the membrane m2 but its surface pore size distribution was too wide resulting in poor separation capacity and low mechanical strength although the introduction of ctfe chain segment in the copolymerization membrane broke the regularity of pvdf molecular chain and led to the decrease of crystallinity the crystalline structure of polymer matrix was converted to a stable Î² phase the presence of ctfe chain segment could protect the main chain of vdf in the erosion process of strong alkali solution in addition the surface and sublayer micropores of pvdf ctfe membranes were small and evenly distributed which not only effectively achieved the rejection of bsa but also provided more permeation channels to improve the separation efficiency when nmp was used as the solvent the synergistic effect of nmp and pvp promoted the full extension of the molecular chain of pvdf ctfe adjusted the interdiffusion rate of solvent and non solvent during phase conversion to membrane the prepared membrane m5 using nmp as solvent which had the highest surface and sublayer porosity the lowest average pore size and the best hydrophilic showed the best ultrafiltration separation performance the pure water flux reached 306 5 l m 2 l 1 and bsa rejection achieved 98 4 moreover the improving anti fouling property and alkaline

chlorotrifluoroethylene pvdf ctfe non solvent induced phase separation nips surface and sublayer microporous structure ultrafiltration performance alkali resistance 1 introduction nowadays the demand for fresh water continues to grow with the development of productivity and the protection and utilization of water resources catch public attention however the traditional operations for treating water will inevitably produce a large number of industrial and domestic wastewater 1 2 if it is not properly treated before discharge it will aggravate the water shortage and endanger the natural environment 3 membrane separation technology as the representative of the modern sewage treatment process is thought to effectively alleviate the problem 4 5 this technology is driven by the difference of pressure potential or concentration using functional membrane components to separate the water and pollutants in the feed liquid its advantages of less secondary pollution low energy consumption and high working efficiency are due to the absence of physical and chemical reactions in the separation process 6 8 its separation performance is mainly affected by the membrane material and its structure common polymers such as polyamide pa polyether sulfone pes and polyvinyl chloride pvc have been prepared as membranes and used in wastewater treatment among them polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane has accounted for a large proportion 9 13 the structural unit of pvdf is ch2 cf2 meaning the molecular chain is protected by fluorine atoms with low polarity and strong electronegativity and the cf bond 485 kj mol 1 is very strong therefore pvdf exhibits excellent thermal stability mechanical strength and machinability it should also be noted that the intrinsic hydrophobicity of pvdf makes the membrane susceptible to contamination by feed fluids so hydrophilic pore forming agents such as polyethylene glycol peg or polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp are added in the process of preparing pvdf membranes to deal with membrane fouling problems 14 15 additionally alkali washing is regarded as an effective method for mitigating membrane fouling but this process will cause irreversible damage to pvdf membrane due to its intolerance to strong alkali solution 16 18 as a result the service life of the membrane is severely shortened which limits the wide application and further development of pvdf in the membrane field 19 20 in reported studies surface coating modification has been devoted to improve the alkali resistance of pvdf membrane but it is difficult to be applied in practical production 21 22 beyond that the development of new fluoropolymer materials to optimize the performance of membrane matrix has become a research hotspot in recent years for example poly vinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropene pvdf hfp poly vinylidene fluoride co tetrafluoroethylene pvdf tfe poly vinylidene fluoride co trifluorethylene pvdf trfe and poly ethylene chlorotrifluoroethylene ectfe 23 32 as another pvdf based copolymer poly vinylidene difluoride co chlorotrifluoroethylene pvdf ctfe not only has good mechanical properties and thermal stability like other fluoropolymers but also has excellent chemical corrosion resistance due to the presence of trifluoroethylene chloride ctfe chain segment in its molecular chain meanwhile the presence of ccl bond provides an active site for modification hence pvdf ctfe has great application potential in membrane materials field 17 33 35 from the perspective of industrial production non solvent induced phase separation nips is still the best method to prepare fluoropolymer membrane 18 36 37 during the preparation process the liquid film occurs phase inversion in coagulation bath and the polymer rich phase in the casting solution transforms into the membrane matrix and the poor phase becomes the micropores 38 39 in the reported studies on the fabrication membrane by nips method the trade off between the permeability and selectivity of the membrane cannot be broken through adjusting the polymer content causing the change of viscosity of the casting solution 34 36 there are reports on the adjustment of solvents and the effect of solvents on the microporous structure of pvdf membrane surface and sublayer 40 41 however the mutual diffusion of water and solvent is affected not only by the thermodynamic factor the solubility parameters of solvent and polymer but also by the kinetic factor the viscosity of casting solution in this work pvdf ctfe flat sheet membranes were prepared via nips using pvp as pore forming agent and n n dimethylacetamide dmac n n dimethylformamide dmf n methylpyrrolidone nmp as solvent respectively the effect of solvent on the rate of l l de mixing was investigated from thermodynamic factor combined kinetics factor meanwhile pvdf pvdf ectfe hybrid matrix membranes were prepared for comparison the morphology pore structure and physicochemical structure of the membranes with different modification methods as well as different solvents were systematically investigated the membrane performance of alkaline resistance water permeability and ultrafiltration were evaluated and the anti fouling property of the membrane was estimated by the zeta potential analyzer in order to demonstrate its potential in industrial implementation 2 experimental 2 1 materials

50 c for 24 h in advance the membranes were prepared by the schematic diagram as shown in fig 1 first of all an appropriate amount of pre dried polymer solvent and additive were added into the sealed flask and mechanically stirred at 60 c for 12 h until the solutions were homogeneous the homogeneous solutions were then placed in a water bath at 60 c for 12 h to eliminate the air bubbles secondly the polymer solutions were distributed evenly across the surface of clean glass plate by a casting knife with a gap of 150 Î¼m and then immersed in a deionized water coagulating bath room temperature 15 c smoothly for phase inversion and removing the residual solvent and additive off finally the wet membranes were dried in a freeze dryer all these flat sheet membranes in this work were prepared from corresponding composition of polymer solution with the process described above and named as m1 m2 m3 m4 and m5 respectively as listed in table 1 2 3 membrane characterization 2 3 1 casting solution viscosity the viscosity of casting solutions prepared from a different formulation was detected by using a rotary viscometer ndj 5s china the influence of casting solution viscosity on membrane structure in the membrane formation process was studied 2 3 2 membrane morphology the surface and section morphology of the membranes were assessed through using a field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem quanta 250 usa under standard high vacuum conditions of 3 00 kv the membranes were brittle broken in liquid nitrogen which was conducive to obtaining a complete and clear cross section due to the poor electrical conductivity of the polymer the samples were attached to the sample table with conductive adhesive followed by gold coating under vacuum using a vacuum magnetron sputter msp 30t japan the surface states of membranes fabricated by different solvents were investigated by atomic force microscopy afm 5100n japan and the roughness was obtained by scanning probe microscope under tapping mode 2 3 3 pore size distribution the pore size distribution and average pore size of top and bottom surface of prepared membranes were calculated by the software of image pro plus ipp 6 0 usa 42 the pores were distinguished on the membrane surface based on the gray value of each pixel in the fe sem topography 2 3 4 porosity since the membrane porosity could be defined as the proportion of pore volume to the total volume of the membrane it was measured by gravimetric method a small piece of dried membrane was soaked in ethylene glycol for 2 h the residual droplets on the membrane surface were wiped with a filter paper and the weight of wet membrane at room temperature was obtained then the weight of dry membrane was acquired after dried in an oven at 75 c the porosity Îµ was calculated by the following equation 43 1 Îµ m w m d Ï w m w m d Ï w m d Ï d 100 m w is the weight of wet membrane m d is the weight of dry membrane Ï w and Ï d are the density of ethylene glycol 0 81 g cm 3 and polymer density pvdf 1 78 g cm 3 pvdf ctfe 1 78 g cm 3 ectfe 1 68 g cm 3 respectively 17 20 29 2 3 5 physicochemical structure the effects of solvent and additive on the physicochemical structure of different membranes were determined by comparing the infrared spectra the spectra were recorded at a range between 600 cm 1 and 4000 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 in attenuated total reflection atr mode using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir nicolet 5700 usa in general the Î² phase content f Î² of the polymer matrix was calculated by the following equation 43 44 2 f Î² a Î² k Î² k Î± a Î± a Î² 100 where the absorption coefficient k Î± 6 1 104 cm2 mol 1 and k Î² 7 7 104 cm2 mol 1 a Î± and a Î² represent the absorbance of Î± phase 766 cm 1 and Î² phase 840 cm 1 respectively 43 2 3 6 thermal analysis the thermal property of each membrane was examined by a differential scanning calorimeter dsc q100 usa about 5 mg of each membrane was placed into the sample dish and heated from room temperature to 250 c at a rate of 10 c min 1 and the heat flow data were recorded in order to eliminate the influence of pvdf polymorphism on the crystallinity the equation of membrane crystallinity Ï c was shown as follows 43 44 3 Ï c Î´h m x Î´h 100 Î± y Î´h 100 Î² 100 where x and y are the mass fraction of Î± phase and Î² phase crystal respectively Î´h m is recorded as melting enthalpy of polymer the melting enthalpy of Î± phase and Î² phase is Î´h 100 Î± 93 04 j g 1 and Î´h 100 Î² 103 4 j g 1 respectively 44 2 4 water infiltration performance in order to characterize the hydrophilicity of the membranes the contact angle between the top surface of membrane and pure water was measured by fixed droplet method using a video contact angle tester jy 82a china each sample was tested for five times and the average value was recorded as the final result the pure water flux was measured to characterized the infiltration performance of the membranes by the test equipment made by the laboratory as shown in fig 2 each membrane with an effective separation area of 7 54 10 4 m2 was tested for 2 h under the pressure of 0 1 mpa to achieve a stable flux and then the pure water flux j was calculated according to the following equation 4 j v a t where v is the volume of permeate liquid after 10 min operation a is the effective separation area of the membranes t is 10 min and each membrane was tested three times 2 5 mechanical property and alkaline resistance the tensile fracture strength of the membranes was detected by an electronic single fiber strength meter yg001n china the samples were cut to 40 mm in length and 4 mm in width fixed vertically between the fixtures stretched at a constant elongation rate of 10 mm min 1 until broke moreover the membranes were treated with strong alkali solution composed of naoh 40 g l 1 and naclo 4 g l 1 at room temperature for 2 h filtration and 20 days immersion respectively afterwards the tensile fracture strength of them were measured by the above method 16 18 all membranes were tested for five times the average value was obtained as the final result the retention rate Î· 1 2 of the fracture strength was used to assess the alkali resistance of each membrane and the equation was as follows 5 Î· 1 Ï 2 Ï 1 100 6 Î· 2 Ï 3 Ï 1 100 where Ï 1 Ï 2 and Ï 3 are respectively the tensile fracture strength of the membranes before the treatment of the strong alkali solution after the treatment of the filtration and immersion in the strong alkali solution respectively 2 6 ultrafiltration and anti fouling performance the ultrafiltration and anti fouling performance of membranes were evaluated at room temperature by the test equipment made by the laboratory as shown in fig 2 after 30 min of prepressure it was tested under the pressure of 0 1 mpa including three stages the first stage the pure water flux within 2 h was measured and denoted as j w1 the second stage was to filter the bsa solution with the mass concentration of 1 g l 1 the corresponding permeate flux was denoted as j bsa1 then the membrane was rinsed by ultrasonic cleaner for 30 min the pure water flux of the washed membrane was denoted as j w2 at the third stage finally the second and third stages were carried out again and the corresponding flux were denoted as j bsa2 and j w3 45 46 the volume of permeate liquid was recorded every 10 min and the flux including j w and j bsa was calculated according to the following equation 7 j w bsa v w bsa a t where v w and v bsa is the volume of permeate liquid a is the effective separation area of the membranes t is the operation time the flux recovery rate frr was calculated according to pure water flux j w and the equation was shown below 8 frr j w 2 j w 1 100 additionally the membrane fouling parameters including reversible fouling resistance r r irreversible fouling resistance r ir and total fouling resistance r t were calculated using the following equations 9 r r j w 2 j bsa 1 j w 1 100 10 r ir j w 1 j w 2 j w 1 100 11 r t j w 1 j bsa 1 j w 1 100 the equation of bsa rejection rate brr was as follows 12 brr 1 c p c f 100 where cf and c p represent the concentrations of bsa in the feed solution and the permeate solution g l 1 respectively the concentration of bsa was determined by an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv 1100 china with the wavelength of 280 nm in order to evaluate the effect of different solvents on the anti fouling property of membranes the surface charge of the prepared membranes in varying ph were measured by the solid surface zeta potential analyzer surpass austria moreover the charge after the pollution of ha and cleaning were also examined 47 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology of the membranes the surface sem morphology of prepared membranes is shown in fig 3 a and b are the top surface which direct contacted with the coagulating bath and bottom surface which coated on the glass plate respectively it could be seen from the comparison of the top and bottom surfaces the skin layer structure appeared on the top surface of each membrane while obvious pore structure on the bottom surface in the membrane forming process the solvent diffusion rate near the top surface contacting with the non solvent directly was faster than that near the bottom surface which led to the formation of skin layer from the surface morphology especially the bottom surface of the membranes m1 m3 it could be seen that compared with the pvdf membrane m1 the surface pores of the pvdf ectfe membrane m2 and the pvdf ctfe membrane m3 were both substantially increased indicating that the modification by blending and copolymerization were both beneficial to the formation of microporous surface structure the former was mainly due to the decrease in polymer concentration which could be reflected by the sharp decline in viscosity of casting solution as shown in table 2 although the viscosity decrease of the latter was not obvious the introduction of ctfe segments adjusted the mass transfer process in phase conversion as a result the surface microporous structure was increased and evenly distributed in order to optimize the membrane structure of pvdf ctfe modified by copolymerization three different solvents were used to prepare the membrane m3 m4 m5 in the current literature only thermodynamic factor was implemented to explain the effect of different solvents on the rate of liquid liquid l l de mixing 40 41 the solubility parameters and mutual diffusivity of water and solvents was presented in table 3 as can be seen that the mutual diffusion between dmf and water is the largest while that between nmp and water is the smallest demonstrating that using nmp as solvent will slow down the rate of l l de mixing more than that the viscosity of the casting solution also effects the rate of l l de mixing considering the kinetic factor as presented in table 2 the viscosity of casting solution was the lowest when dmf was applied the low kinetic resistance in membrane forming process made the interdiffusion rate between solvent and water faster and the surface microporous structure less in contrast the casting solution viscosity increased dramatically when nmp was used as the solvent contributing to the poor and rich phase movement of the polymer were both hindered combined with the factors of thermodynamic and kinetic in the phase inversion the rate of l l de mixing was controlled and the surface porosity was the highest as shown in fig 4 and table 4 the surface of the membrane m5 appeared microgranular protuberance structure rp and rv are lower than those of the membrane m3 and m4 indicating that the membrane m5 can not only maintain an appropriate contact area with water molecules but also reduce the accumulation of pollutants caused by deep valleys on the surface this was mainly because the similar chemical structure between the solvent nmp and the pore forming agent pvp which allowed the molecular chains of pvdf ctfe to fully stretch verified by the significantly increase of the casting solution viscosity in the process of membrane forming the polymer matrix was affected by induced crystallization to occur the solid liquid s l phase separation and form the microgranular protuberances as can be seen in fig 5 the membranes prepared by nips had typical asymmetric cross section structures consisting of finger like pores with dense skin surface pear shaped microvoids and spongy polymer matrix whose formation were mainly caused by the strong polarity of the solvent and the hydrophilic modification of pvp the l l de mixing played a dominant role in the phase inversion process the non solvent diffused rapidly into the membrane to form a macroporous structure and push the polymer rich phase to the pore wall and bottom surface to obtain a spongy pore structure moreover it could be clearly observed from fig 6 that the prepared membranes had varying finger like pores near the top layer especially the largest number and most uniform size of the membrane m5 demonstrating that it is not only provided more permeability channels for water molecular but also possessed the increasing stability during infiltration this was because the rate of l l de mixing decreased with the increase of casting solution viscosity and the decreased of mutual diffusivity between solvent and water leading to the loose finger like pores near the top layer became more regular 3 2 structure and distribution of micropores in order to visually display the changes of surface micropore structure the software of ipp6 0 was implemented to calculate the pore size distribution and average pore size after processing the surface morphology 34 42 the relevant data and porosity measured by gravimetric method are shown in fig 7 it could be seen that the porosity of all the membranes was higher than 83 which benefited from the microvoids formed after the polymer poor phase was removed by phase inversion according to the average pore size and distribution in fig 7 the copolymerized modified membrane m3 possessed larger surface micropore size than the unmodified membrane m1 and narrower distribution than the blend modified membrane m2 resulting from the smaller viscosity of casting solution as the solvent was changed the surface average pore size of the membrane m4 increased and its distribution widened in comparison with membrane m3 when dmf was used as solvent it could be interpreted as the improvement of the l l de mixing rate similar to the membrane m2 with the increase of phase separation rate the pore size on the membrane surface increased but the number of micropores decreased sharply which was not conducive to the improvement of separation efficiency however when nmp was used as the solvent the opposite phenomenon appeared the number of micropores in the membrane m5 increased significantly the pore size became smaller and the distribution became narrower it thanked to the synergistic effect of the pore forming agent pvp and the solvent nmp promoted the s l de mixing process 43 44 it meant that pvdf ctfe membrane with superior micropore structure could be obtained by using nmp as the solvent compared with dmac and dmf 3 3 physicochemical structure of polymer matrix in this work the physicochemical structure and crystallization property of prepared membranes were analyzed by ftir and dsc the ftir spectra of the membranes m1 m5 and a pvdf membrane prepared without pvp are shown in fig 8 therein a is the full spectrum with wavelengths ranging from 3000 to 700 cm 1 and b is the partial spectrum with characteristic absorption peaks at 1400 1179 1067 973 876 840 799 and 766 cm 1 it could be seen from fig 8 a that with the addition of pvp the characteristic absorption peaks of co and cn bonds appeared at 1676 and 1275 cm 1 for the membranes m1 m5 17 48 that was because as a water soluble macromolecule additive although most of pvp was rinsed off in the membrane forming process some of its molecular chains were physically entangled with the molecular chains of pvdf or pvdf ctfe during the casting solution preparation coupled with the hydrogen bonding between co of pvp and ch of the polymer matrix resulting in partial residue of pvp and modification of prepared membranes besides a detailed analysis of the ftir spectrum as shown in fig 8b exhibited that the polymer matrix crystallized from Î± phase to Î² phase with the addition of pvp by comparing changes in characteristic peaks at 766 799 876 and 973 cm 1 derived from Î± phase polymorph and 840 1067 1179 and 1400 cm 1 derived from Î² phase polymorph 49 51 in order to further analyze the influence of different modification methods and solvents on the crystalline properties of prepared membranes the content of Î² phase was calculated according to the absorption intensity of the peaks at 766 cm 1 Î± phase and 840 cm 1 Î² phase together with the data of melting point and crystallinity acquired from dsc they are listed in table 5 as shown in table 5 the Î² phase content and crystallinity of the blend modified membrane m2 were both reduced according to the report the Î² phase of pvdf based polymer was a thermodynamically stable phase with an all trans conformation its growth would be inhibited by high phase inversion rate 43 44 the decrease in the casting solution viscosity of the membrane m2 resulted in the acceleration of the phase inversion rate ultimately inhibited the growth of Î² phase crystal meanwhile the melting point of the copolymerization modified membrane m3 decreased with the decrease of crystallinity this was because the regularity of the pvdf molecular chains was destroyed after the ctfe segments were introduced into the vdf segments thereby their crystallization performance was negatively affected when dmf was used as solvent the rate of l l de mixing was accelerated due to the factors of thermodynamics and kinetics during the phase inversion the membrane m4 showed lower crystallinity and melting point than m3 in contrast the rate of l l de mixing decreased significantly using nmp as solvent the content of Î² phase crystal increased caused an increase in crystallinity and was reflected in an increase in the melting point of the membrane m5 demonstrating that nmp improved the crystallization property and thermal stability of pvdf ctfe membrane 3 4 mechanical properties and alkali resistance the influence of modification methods and solvents on mechanical properties and alkali resistance of prepared membranes were discussed the tensile strength as well as the strength retention rate Î· 1 2 and after the treatment of strong alkali solution were displayed in fig 9 as presented in fig 9 after the treatment of filtration or immersion the tensile strength of the modified membranes both decreased due to the increase of the overall porosity when the pvdf ctfe membrane prepared using dmf as solvent its strength decreased due to the stress concentration phenomenon that was more likely to occur which was affected by the wide surface pore size distribution the increase in the number of micropores on the membrane surface also resulted in a decrease in the strength of pvdf ctfe membrane when nmp was used as solvent the strength retention rates of unmodified pvdf membrane m1 after filtration or immersion in strong alkali solution were 78 and 59 respectively it was because the molecular chains of pvdf formed cc bonds under the dehydrofluorination of alkaline solution the linkage isomerism of head to head and tail to tail in the molecular chains led to the appearance of conjugated system cccc and finally caused the degradation of pvdf 52 the slight improvement of alkali resistance of the membrane m2 was mainly benefit from the ectfe which possessed better chemical inertia however the irregular surface and sublayer micropore structure of membrane m2 collapsed after treatment resulting in the retention rate of filtration and immersion were only 82 and 76 respectively in particular the introduction of ctfe segments into the vdf molecular chains reduced the possibility of conjugated system after dehydrofluorine in alkali solution 53 moreover the ccl bond would give priority to the dehydrochlorine reaction which played a protective role in the vdf enriched segments 16 18 as shown in the degradation schematic of fig 10 therefore the retention rate of pvdf ctfe membranes separately maintained about 90 and 80 after different treatment it is worth noting that the retention rate of membrane m5 maintain at 98 after filtration of alkali solution due to the regular micropore structure showing excellent chemical resistance 3 5 water permeability of the membranes the water permeability of membrane is influenced by the micropore structure providing the permeation channel and surface hydrophilicity reflecting the permeation pressure 48 53 in order to evaluate the water permeability of prepared membranes the static water contact angle of the separation layer top surface and the pure water flux under the circulating water pressure of 0 1 mpa were measured the results are shown in fig 11 as exhibited in fig 11 the employment of hydrophilic additive pvp partly improved the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface in view of the intrinsic hydrophobicity of pvdf based resin 35 39 all the contact angle were below 75 it was also proved that the appearance of co and cn bonds in the ftir spectrum fig 8a was the residue after the chain entanglement of pvp macromolecule and polymer molecule the membrane crystallinity reduced with the decrease of pvdf content and at the same time the porosity of the membrane increased which leads to an increase in water flux beyond that the loose spherulite structure and the hydrophilic Î² phase are conducive to the reduction of water permeability resistance 34 54 although the contact angle increased due to the introduction of high hydrophobic ectfe resin the larger micropores and higher porosity resulted in the maximum pure water flux of the membrane m2 for the copolymerization modification the introduction of ctfe chain segments reduced the structure regularity of polymer molecular chains increased the roughness of membrane surface and further improved its hydrophilicity especially the membrane m5 prepared by using nmp as solvent had the smallest contact angle and its pure water flux reached 306 5 l m 2 h 1 3 6 dynamic anti fouling and ultrafiltration performance to determine the anti fouling and ultrafiltration performance of prepared membranes a three step filtration test was applied pure water bsa solution pure water with two cycles in this work 45 46 the time dependent permeation fluxes of the membranes were shown in fig 12 the flux recovery ratio and fouling resistance was calculated by the stable flux data to reflect the anti fouling performance of prepared membranes and the bsa rejection ratio was measured to study the ultrafiltration performance as shown in fig 13 in order to evaluate the effect of different solvents on the membrane anti fouling performance the surface zeta potential of membranes m3 m4 and m5 was estimated as presented in fig 14 it could be seen from fig 12 that the permeation flux of each membrane decreased and gradually stabilized with the increase of operating time at every testing cycle compared with pvdf matrix membranes m1 m2 the flux attenuation of pvdf ctfe membrane was smaller indicating that the introduction of ctfe chain segments increased the pressure resistance of polymer matrix phase in each bsa solution testing the flux was significantly lower than that of pure water due to the aggregation of protein molecules demonstrating that the bsa could be effectively rejected by the prepared membranes combined with fig 13 a the separation efficiency of all prepared membranes decreased after two cycle testing on the one hand a part of the membrane pore structure was broken by ultrasonic cleaning the collapse of sublayer pore structure reduced the water transport channel and the fracture of surface pore decreased the rejection ratio on the other hand the membrane was polluted by intrusion of bsa it is worth noting that the water flux of membrane m5 was the largest after two cycles and the bsa rejection ratio was still maintained at about 90 after ultrasonic cleaning the reason is that its regular surface and sublayer micropore structure provide a stable transport channel and narrowest pore distribution indicating that membrane m5 possessed excellent ultrafiltration performance as presented in fig 13 the frr and r r of all the prepared membranes reduced in the second cycle due to the aggravation of membrane fouling the improved hydrophilicity of the membranes is conducive to the construction of a dense nano water layer on its surface during the separation process thus enhancing the removal of pollutants moreover the regular surface microporous structure can prevent pollutants from invading into the inner membrane and causing irreversible fouling therefore the frr and r r of membrane m5 decreased slightly compared with other membranes in general the surface zeta potential of membrane will change with the attachment of pollutants and the membrane surface with strong electronegativity has better resistance to electronegative pollutants under the action of electrostatic force 47 it can be seen from the fig 14 the membrane m5 possessed the strongest electronegativity and the potential after cleaning was close to the original in summary the anti fouling and ultrafiltration performance of membrane m5 are excellent and stable 4 conclusion in this work the pvdf pvdf ectfe and pvdf ctfe membranes were prepared via the nips method using dmac as solvent and pvp as pore forming additive different solvents dmf nmp were selected to regulate the structure of pvdf ctfe membranes the addition of high chemically inert ectfe resin in the blending membrane partly improved the permeability and alkali resistance of the membrane m2 but its surface pore size distribution was too wide resulting in poor separation capacity and low mechanical strength although the introduction of ctfe chain segment in the copolymerization membrane broke the regularity of pvdf molecular chain and led to the decrease of crystallinity the crystalline structure of polymer matrix was converted to a stable Î² phase the presence of ctfe chain segment could protect the main chain of vdf in the erosion process of strong alkali solution in addition the surface and sublayer micropores of pvdf ctfe membranes were small and evenly distributed which not only effectively achieved the rejection of bsa but also provided more permeation channels to improve the separation efficiency when nmp was used as the solvent the synergistic effect of nmp and pvp promoted the full extension of the molecular chain of pvdf ctfe adjusted the interdiffusion rate of solvent and non solvent during phase conversion to membrane the prepared membrane m5 using nmp as solvent which had the highest surface and sublayer porosity the lowest average pore size and the best hydrophilic showed the best ultrafiltration separation performance the pure water flux reached 306 5 l m 2 l 1 and bsa rejection achieved 98 4 moreover the improving anti fouling property and alkaline resistance indicated that the pvdf ctfe membrane possessed potential to treat wastewater even in harsh environment credit authorship contribution statement wenyi ma methodology investigation

developing countries textile manufacturing is a complex issue in relation to the environment the use of water and all the resulting pollution for water receiving systems 1 the textile industry is considered one of the main sources of environmental contamination among the industrial sectors these effluents are severely polluting due to the reactive chemical compounds that constitute the water such as hydro soluble and colorful substances which have strong color due to the presence of residual dyes of high organic and inorganic matter and of their turbidity and ph and which have elevated use due to the popularity of cotton fabrics and bright dyes textile wastewaters present bod cod ratio between 0 10 and 0 25 indicating the existence of non biodegradable organic compounds such as dyes in these waters 2 in this respect the presence of a very small amount of residual dye in the water affects the receptor environment not only aesthetically but also impacts aquatic life by preventing the penetration of light and oxygen transfer 3 therefore the adequate removal of dyes before they re launched into water bodies is of great importance not only for environmental preservation but also to public health several techniques were applied to remove the dyes from wastewater including adsorption chemical oxidation advanced oxidation processes and even microorganisms like fungi however their low removal efficiencies and or high operating cost generally limit their application 4 6 however the constant progress in research on the electrocoagulation ec process highlights the importance of the technique and its promising impact on wastewater treatment ec stands out as a sustainable alternative for treating wastewater among all electrochemical processes due to its simple configuration and high capacity to treat large water amounts without any type of intensive chemical treatment moreover the versatility of the process and its configuration allow ec to treat a wide variety of wastewaters and industries with different types of pollutants 7 the ec is considered a relatively simple electrochemical technique consisting of the application of a potential between two metal electrodes with production of metallic ions in situ from the electrode material resulting in the formation of coagulants in the effluent which eliminate suspended and dissolved inorganic and or organic substances in the water 8 10 during the ec process al3 ions are released from the sacrificial anode and oh is generated at the cathode by electrochemical reactions according to the ph during the reaction of aluminum the following monomeric and or polymeric species can be formed al oh 2 al oh 2 al2 oh 2 4 al oh 4 al6 oh 15 3 al7 oh 17 4 al8 oh 20 4 al13o4 oh 24 7 and al13 oh 34 5 until the conversion of these on al oh 3 s solid aluminum hydroxide aluminum hydroxide presents relatively high surface area able to promote adsorption of soluble organic compounds and imprisonment of colloidal particles with the formation of gelatinous flakes like the key reactions are as the following 11 12 eqs 1 and 2 1 anode al s al aq 3 3e 2 cathode 3h 2 o 3e 3 2h 2 3oh al3 and oh ions are formed by electrode reactions eqs 1 and 2 to create various monomeric types which finally converted to al oh 3 s according to the following equation eq 3 3 3h 2 o al aq 3 al oh 3 s 3h therefore with the application of an electrical current in ec sacrificial anodes are used to dose the water polluted with a coagulating agent such as aluminum hydroxide also gases stemming from the electrolysis of water usually o2 and h2 are generated in both electrodes with sufficient overpotentials capable of promoting the removal of the coagulated pollutants through flotation 13 many researchers around the world have conducted several studies with ec so far to assess the operational efficiency of the technique with various types of effluents from the textile industry 14 19 waters from the fishing industry 20 and poultry slaughterhouses 17 21 metallic industrial effluents 22 23 from mining 24 removal of oils and grease 11 25 26 wastewater from dairy products 27 28 and printing 29 and paper companies 30 according to moussa et al 31 the ec presents several parameters that directly influence the efficiency and removal of pollutants from the wastewater the most important parameters affecting the process are ph electrolyte concentration current density concentration of pollutant electrolysis time and electrode type 15 16 32 34 with that in mind the efficiency of a wastewater treatment process can be evaluated from different perspectives toxicity tests are desirable tools to evaluate water quality and wastewater pollutant concentration since only physical and chemical analyses the limits of which are established by environmental legislation are not able to distinguish substances that affect biological systems and inert substances to the environment and quality of waters the bioindicator d magna employed in the evaluation of the toxicity of chemical contaminants has some advantages performing in biotoxicity tests genetic stability representativeness of their trophic level evaluation of the acute and chronic effects of toxic chemicals and constant and elevated selectivity to contaminants 35 37 therefore chemical analyses and toxicity tests complement one another allowing for an integrated assessment of environmental quality of aquatic species 38 39 still textile effluents involving the use of dyes are often very complex and require intensive treatment it becomes important to evaluate not only the operational efficiency of effluent treatment but the toxicology of treated wastewater on the effects of a toxic agent on organisms according to exposure time and the life cycle of the organism the present study proposes the development of a methodology for treatments of synthetic wastewater from the textile industry with the presence of azo dye since the reactive dyes present in effluents from the textile industry are constituted by water soluble and colored substances for this purpose the efficiency of the ec in the treatment of synthetic textile effluents was evaluated through factorial planning physicochemical analysis parameters such as cod true color and toc the formation of residual aluminum from the experimental tests according to the experimental design adopted was also evaluated in relation to the study variables applied in the ec treatment azo dye concentration electrolyte concentration and current intensity the evaluation of toxic effects of synthetic effluent in the presence of azo dye employing the bioindicator d magna daphniidae was chosen for the evaluation of the mobility and or lethality of individuals through means of the ec50 test of median effective concentration therefore the main objective of this research was to evaluate i the efficiency of applying the ec in the treatment of synthetic textile effluent for the removal of azo dye in relation to cod toc and true color parameters ii the presence of residual aluminum resulting from the electro dissociation process of aluminum metal electrodes iii the effect of acute toxicity employing bioindicator d magna in the synthetic textile effluent in the presence of azo dye and in the effluent treated by the electrocoagulation process iv the operational parameters adopted in the experimental tests current intensity electrolyte concentration and concentration of azo dye and their influence on treatment efficiency via ec the effects on acute toxicity testing and residual aluminum formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental configuration for the application of the electrocoagulation process the descriptive scheme presented in fig 1 was used the experimental apparatus consists of using a source of continuous power labo 2845 115 vca with maximum current capacity of 5 0a and maximum voltage of 120 v and a borosilicate reactor uniglass model on a bench scale with net volume of 1 0 l the electrochemical cell was subjected to magnetic stirring microquÃ­mica mqama 301 at constant agitation speed of 600 rpm inside the reactor a monopolar system of aluminum electrodes as anode and cathode was installed with dimensions of 100 mm length 40 mm width and 1 mm thickness the electrodes were submerged at a depth of 78 mm providing a submerged surface area of 31 20 mm2 2 2 synthetic textile effluent ste the ste used in this study consists of applying reactive red 231 rr231 azo dye of difficult degradation employed in the dyeing process of the textile industry its chemical structure is characterized mainly by the presence of two azo groups as a chromophore group and two monoclorotriazyne groups as reactive groups as shown in fig 2 the synthetic effluent was prepared by dissolving the azoic dye in one liter 1 l of deionized water in the electrochemical reactor and diluted according to experimental tests adopted in each experiment 2 3 operational strategies the delimitation of the operational strategies for this study was based on preliminary ec tests evaluating the different concentrations of dye affected by the variation in electrolyte concentration and in the electrical current intensity eci applied to the process for 20 min of electrolysis the concentrations of dye were determined to simulate the nearest possible scenario of the properties of textile industry wastewater therefore operational strategies en adopted for this study are summarized in table 1 which presents electrolyte concentration 2 0 and 4 0 g l 1 dye

crustacean that acts in the aquatic food chain as a primary consumer feeding by filtration on the particulate organic material present in the medium 40 41 the tests were performed under the conditions of 20 2 c in an incubator chamber cienlab ce 300 350f with 16 hour light and 8 hour dark photoperiod with 400 lux intensities immobility and or lethality was observed after 48 h the test consists of exposing young individuals to pre established concentrations of the toxic agent for a period of 48 h with the objective of determining ec50 concentration that causes immobility to 50 of the exposed organisms the test results were statistically evaluated using the trimmed spearman karber method version 1 5 software cultivation maintenance and verification of organisms sensitivities were carried out in accordance with the recommendations of abnt nbr 12713 2016 and iso 6341 2012 standards 42 43 the cultivation method allows for the maintenance of test organisms in the laboratory aiming at maximizing reproduction minimizing mortality and maintaining sensitivity of organisms to evaluate the toxicity of water soluble chemicals the control tests with the d magna species negative control were carried out employing 20 ml of a distilled water test solution five individuals were added per replicate in quadruplicate all aged from 6 h to 24 h of life the tests were maintained at 20 c 2 c

for windows version 7 0 statsoft 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect the ph turbidity and ts the efficiency of the ec was evaluated based on the determination of ph turbidity residual aluminum cod true color ts and cot relating to the operational variables adopted in this study current intensity electrolyte concentration and dye concentration results referring to the physicochemical analyses are summarized in table 2 the ste presented a turbidity value of 0 55 unt and after treatment presented a value of 1 47 unt in the e8 experimental test according to a study by khandegar and saroha 44 metallic ions formed at suitable ph constitute a wide range of coagulated species and metallic hydroxides that precipitate and adsorb dissolved contaminants or destabilize and add suspended particles during electrocoagulation this study observed an increase in the ph value from 4 34 for the synthetic textile effluent to ph values near neutrality 6 96 to 8 39 in the electrocoagulation process with aluminum electrodes the results corroborate those of the studies presented by verma 3 with an increase in the ph value for acid solutions ph 2 to 6 for textile wastewaters to final ph values from 7 0 to 8 0 being observed related to the increase of the concentration of hydroxide ions formed in the solution due to the speed of dissolution of the anode hence with aluminum being a lewis acid it establishes bonds with oh anions resulting in a buffer effect with final ph between 7 and 8 favoring the formation of monomeric and polymeric species that induce the presence of scanning flakes with fast absorption of soluble organic compounds 3 45 ghosh et al 46 in a study about the conditions of the chemical pre treatment process involving coagulation mechanisms point to effectiveness in turbidity reduction with ph values around 5 50 and 9 0 with constant maximum value in this study increased turbidity can be explained by the presence of flakes that are formed during the process due to high wear of aluminum metal electrodes according to a study by nÃºÃ±ez et al 47 employing the ec for a period of 20 min the maximum removal efficiency is 51 in this perspective a possible hypothesis for low efficiency in turbidity reduction may be because an amount of dye that stays present in residual water after electrochemical treatment can affect turbidity measurement 47 similarly the high electrical conductivity in aqueous medium implies an adverse effect in removing turbidity since elevated electrolyte concentrations can produce changes in the ionic force which in turn influences kinetics and balance between particle charges during reactions occurring throughout the process much the same way an ec operation with high values of electrical current intensity eci promotes accelerated wear of metal electrodes and increased consumption of electricity still higher than ideal values of eci lose efficiency to the process resulting in the formation of significant amounts of bubbles in the electrolytic cell thus the number of bubbles grows due to the incorporation of smaller bubbles coalescence a phenomenon that prevents aggregation from bubbles with contaminants in this respect a rise in eci promotes intensive formation of al3 ions in the effluent increasing the repulsive potential between charges resulting in increased turbidity and aluminum concentration in the treated effluent results from table 2 present a significant increment at the final concentration of total solids ts compared to the raw effluent sample in this respect the leaching aluminum in the effluent due to the wear of the metallic electrode is thought to have contributed to increased ts values in this scenario strategies e1 e4 e6 and e7 have shown highest wear of the electrodes which is directly associated with a 4 0a ec when it comes to ph values of the effluent the influence of this parameter in the ec is evidenced therefore the analysis of the solubility diagram of aluminum hydroxide implies that the amplitude of al3 hydrolysis depends on ph in view of the above the hydrolysis and polymerization of al3 in the ph range of 5 0 to 9 0 generate mononuclear species and or complex polynuclear aluminum such as for example al oh 3 al oh 2 al2 oh 4 e al17 oh 32 7 which are effective pollutant coagulants while in high ph values of the solution the dominant species is a oh 4 which obviously does not coagulate the pollutants and allows for lower efficiency in flocculation 48 49 likewise excessive agitation combined with high eci can promote an increment in ts values the associative effect of increasing stirring shear rate and eci values promotes the formation of hydrogen bubbles the presence of hydrogen bubbles motivates destabilization of flake structures and induces rupture and homogeneity in the process of contaminant agglutination resulting in the dissolution of organic compounds absorbed by the coagulant in the solution and consequently raising its concentration 50 3 2 cod toc and true color according to table 3 strategies in which concentrations of nacl were 2 0 g l 1 are thought to be more efficient in toc removal in the case of the ste the value was 657 63 mg l 1 that way the presence of salt is responsible for decreasing amounts of gas bubbles especially hydrogen bubbles floatability of smaller bubbles is slower when compared to larger bubbles and by slowly rising to the surface they collide with the contaminant which allows for an effective removal of the latter this way we point out that highly active chlorine species can form in such cases potentially capable of raising pollutant degradation rates these species include for example cl2 hclo and clo ions which may subsequently oxidize pollutants and at the same time chemically oxidize the anode material often these reactions can be beneficial since the performance of an ec reactor can be improved 51 52 in relation to results obtained for the true color parameter in experimental tests e1 and e2 it was observed color removal in the order of 96 5 and 95 7 in only 20 min of electrolysis as shown in fig 3 the operational condition proposed 4 0 a in this test provided an increase in the speed of ion transfer from the electrode to the aqueous medium favoring formation of the coagulant flocculant al oh 3 for color removal the contribution of cationic metal species generated through electrode dissolution has more affinity for anionic dyes because of the strong electrical attraction between negatively charged dyes and positively charged coagulants 18 furthermore the addition of nacl to increase conductivity may be responsible for generating free chlorine which eventually can reduce the effects of other anions such as sulfate and bicarbonate 53 results of the cod applying the ec promoted a reduction of 42 7 to 85 1 of the ste the strategies that obtained better efficiency in removing cod had 4 0 a the intensity applied determines the dosage of coagulant at the anode and the evolution of hydrogen gas at the cathode in addition bubble density affects the hydrodynamics of the system which in turn influences the mass transfer between pollutants coagulants and micro gas bubbles and ultimately dictates the collision rate of coagulated particles that results in floc formation 13 54 this increase in eci during the process allowed for a degradation of organic compounds present in the effluent which was proportional to the removal effect as well as the disruption of water molecules and consequent release of gases however experimental tests e1 and e6 showed a negative effect with the addition of a higher concentration of electrolyte 4 0 g l 1 resulting in an increased final cod of the system when compared to the concentration of 2 0 g l 1 as shown in table 3 addition of excess nacl to the solution causes adverse effects of other anions such as carbonates and sulfate ions the variation in electrolyte concentration in cod removal efficiency can be attributed to a change in ionic strength due to the change in the conductivity of the aqueous medium the ionic strength clearly affects the kinetics and balance of reactions between charged species that occur during ec 55 furthermore the presence of these ions allows for the precipitation of ca2 and mg2 ions responsible for the formation of a passivating layer on the electrode surface changing the electrical potential of the electrodes and consequently negatively affecting the efficiency of the system 17 56 maximum cod removal efficiency is not as high as the efficiencies found for color and toc removal comparing strategy e6 with e7 which had the same eci 4 a and the same nacl g l 1 concentration varying only in dye concentration 0 05 0 10 mg l 1 cod removal was shown to be less efficient when the dye concentration was 0 10 mg l 1 this fact can be attributed to the complex nature of the dye molecules which results in the lack of oxidation during the ec therefore dye molecules can still be found in the solution after treatment in fact it is known that the azo dyes used in the process are characterized by azo bonds n n and have so 3 and coo groups these dyes have high solubility and are not easily adsorbed therefore their presence negatively affects treatment performance in relation to cod removal 47 57 3 3 residual aluminum the concentration of residual aluminum from the ec showed variation in its values about post treatment and water quality as seen in fig 4 it was evidenced in all tests with aluminum electrodes an increase in the concentration of residual aluminum in the treated effluent with a value above the limit of 0 10 mg al l 1 as established in article 14 of conama resolution 357 2005 this phenomenon can be observed in strategy seven e7 using 4 0 a for both aluminum electrodes in this sense the e7 strategy presented a dissolved aluminum concentration of 36 02 mg l 1 indicating an increase of approximately 39 times the final concentration in relation to the concentration of 0 93 mg l 1 found for the ste in this regard for reactions with higher eci 4 a a considerable increase in electrode wear can be observed with an increase in the concentration of residual aluminum in the treated effluent as illustrated in fig 5 the same fact was observed in the study carried out by souza et al 58 using and comparing three different coagulants flocculants tannin pac and also4 and the ec for treatments of liquid effluents from a textile laundry however the amount of aluminum in the raw effluent was 17 95 mg l 1 after treatment by ec the aluminum concentration values increased reaching 58 60 mg l 1 in liquid medium and 42 93 mg l 1 in dry sludge kambuyi et al 59 reported that residual aluminum has a short residence time inside a continuous flow single channel cfsc reactor ec reactor in a process of electro dissolution but it is still quantified as material consumed by the process and remains dissolved in the treated water resulting in increased concentrations of residual aluminum the data obtained corroborate with the research developed by wellner et al 60 presenting residual aluminum concentration of 33 66 mg l 1 1 105 a and 500 mg nacl l 1 and residual aluminum concentration of 17 08 mg l 1 8 996 a and 5000 mg nacl l 1 as reported anode dissolution increased with increasing sodium chloride concentration therefore chemical dissolution phenomena of metallic electrodes occur by dissolving aluminum oxide coatings from the metallic surface in this context aqueous media containing chloride ions dissolved as salt can contribute to the dissolution of aluminum electrodes through corrosive pitting mechanisms that promote aggressive corrosive attacks of various shapes and depths that is the size and distribution of dots on the metallic surface of the aluminum electrode may be dependent on the concentration of sodium chloride 61 likewise the use of aluminum metal electrodes with high current intensity has the potential to increase the temperature of the electrochemical reaction promoting a retraction in al oh 3 flakes sizes which are more likely to be deposited on the surface of the electrode 12 the temperature increase observed in this research around 36 33 c for e2 and 82 c for the e7 test promotes an increase in aluminum solubility thus the increase in temperature has positive and negative effects on removal efficiency furthermore it is possible to state that the effect of temperature on the removal efficiency depends on the mechanism for pollutant removal 62 the amount of residual aluminum formed after the ec is a potential problem due to the formation of large amounts of dissolved aluminum after ec the presence of high concentrations of aluminum in water is considered a potential problem in the development of alzheimer s and neurodegenerative disease 3 4 acute toxicity test the results obtained in the acute toxicity tests in relation to synthetic raw effluent and the eight experimental tests via ec are presented in table 4 the results presented were obtained after 48 h of exposure of the bioindicator and the median effective concentration of the sample affecting 50 of the organisms tested ec50 in ascending order the smallest value of ec50 was obtained for the synthetic raw effluent 3 52 2 41 followed by test e8 5 87 1 35 the highest values presented for the mean effective concentration ec50 were obtained in the experimental test e2 40 24 2 26 the results presented show that the ec applied to synthetic textile effluent results in an increase in the ec50 value of ste reference the combination of variables electrolyte concentration 4 0 g l 1 dye concentration of 0 05 g l 1 and current intensity of 2 0 a provided an increase in the value of ec50 in 1043 18 and the combination of variables electrolyte concentration of 4 0 g l 1 dye concentration of 0 10 g l 1 and current intensity of 4 0 a was shown to increase ec50 value in 622 72 making the wastewater treated by the ec less toxic considering the exposure to the substance for a short period of time acute variation in results may occur due to factors such as sensitivity of the culture of the organisms used methodology for preparing the solution used in the test leaching of aluminum ions into the solution due to electro dissolution of metallic electrodes recalcitrant compounds formed in the ec among other factors the results in relation to tukey s test point to different lowercase letters in the same column and indicate a significant difference at the 5 level of significance by tukey s test data analysis regarding the median lethal concentration showed a significant difference in the data obtained using the anova statistical test tukey s test p 0 05 of the raw effluent in relation to the other experimental tests performed the data from experimental tests e1 e2 e3 and e4 suggest that increasing the concentration of electrolyte promotes a reduction in the toxic effect however the values corresponding to cod toc and residual aluminum are not in line with the data obtained in this study in this regard the increase in electrical conductivity of the solutions does not imply an increase in dye removal efficiency but only a reduction in the reactor s electrical energy consumption the data obtained is inconclusive indicating only that the synthetic effluent treatment process via ec presents less toxicity when compared to the raw synthetic effluent still toxicity was not eliminated indicating the possible presence of recalcitrant compounds toxic to those organisms that were not effectively removed by the ec the same fact was reported in the study by methneni et al 63 which evaluated the toxicity of effluents from three tunisian textile industries using four bioindicators including d magna in order to simulate different trophic levels the toxicity of d magna showed slightly lower values after treatment compared to the raw effluent even so the presence of persistent toxic agents was evidenced in the study conducted by alderete et al 64 evaluating the toxicity of the azo dye amido black 10b ab10b with d magna tests they obtained 100 immobility of the bioindicator after 24 and 48 h of exposure with ec50 values around 5 the high toxicity of the treated effluent may be associated with two by products generated with the cleavage of the azo bonds of ab10b 4 nitroaniline and 2 7 triamino 8 hydroxy 3 6 naphthalene disulfonate brambilla et al 65 achieved very similar results presenting excellent color removal from the effluent however the applied treatment technique favored the generation of recalcitrant by products of the cleavage of the nn bond of the azo dye with the production of potentially toxic amines generating high toxicity after treatment the wear of metallic electrodes caused by high eci 4a the increase in temperature of the electrochemical reaction and the presence of chloride ions derived from the nacl electrolyte potentially favor the electro dissolution of aluminum ions and the consequent increase in toxic effects meanwhile the toxicity observed in this study may be associated with the complex structure of the dye and the production via electro dissolution of al3 ion species responsible for the generation of recalcitrant by products 4 conclusion this work aimed to investigate the efficiency of treating a synthetic textile effluent applying ec under different operating conditions the ec presented maximum removal efficiency of true color toc and cod of 96 5 93 5 and 85 1 respectively thus suiting the environmental legislation relative to the conditions and standards of effluent release for true color and cod conama resolution no 357 2005 and cema resolution no 0070 2009 the best operating conditions for the ec were with a 4 0 a current intensity and 2 0 g l 1 of electrolyte however it was observed in this study that values of 4 a employed for the ec promoted a marked electrodissolution reaction on the metallic aluminum electrodes forming al3 chemical species responsible for the presence of residual aluminum in the acute toxicity tests despite minor changes to the analyzed parameters significant effects p 0 05 were made evident in the test organisms used in the raw effluent relative to the ec treatment applied in the experimental tests with 95 confidence granting unsafe values for the aquatic biota therefore the adjustment to the experimental operating parameters and the combination with the use of absorption techniques to remove residual aluminum and other recalcitrant by products generated during the ec may aid the decision making for a better configuration of the textile

13204,effluents generated by the textile industry can cause serious damage to receiving bodies of water if not adequately treated in this context new treatment methods have been investigated with

developing countries textile manufacturing is a complex issue in relation to the environment the use of water and all the resulting pollution for water receiving systems 1 the textile industry is considered one of the main sources of environmental contamination among the industrial sectors these effluents are severely polluting due to the reactive chemical compounds that constitute the water such as hydro soluble and colorful substances which have strong color due to the presence of residual dyes of high organic and inorganic matter and of their turbidity and ph and which have elevated use due to the popularity of cotton fabrics and bright dyes textile wastewaters present bod cod ratio between 0 10 and 0 25 indicating the existence of non biodegradable organic compounds such as dyes in these waters 2 in this respect the presence of a very small amount of residual dye in the water affects the receptor environment not only aesthetically but also impacts aquatic life by preventing the penetration of light and oxygen transfer 3 therefore the adequate removal of dyes before they re launched into water bodies is of great importance not only for environmental preservation but also to public health several techniques were applied to remove the dyes from wastewater including adsorption chemical oxidation advanced oxidation processes and even microorganisms like fungi however their low removal efficiencies and or high operating cost generally limit their application 4 6 however the constant progress in research on the electrocoagulation ec process highlights the importance of the technique and its promising impact on wastewater treatment ec stands out as a sustainable alternative for treating wastewater among all electrochemical processes due to its simple configuration and high capacity to treat large water amounts without any type of intensive chemical treatment moreover the versatility of the process and its configuration allow ec to treat a wide variety of wastewaters and industries with different types of pollutants 7 the ec is considered a relatively simple electrochemical technique consisting of the application of a potential between two metal electrodes with production of metallic ions in situ from the electrode material resulting in the formation of coagulants in the effluent which eliminate suspended and dissolved inorganic and or organic substances in the water 8 10 during the ec process al3 ions are released from the sacrificial anode and oh is generated at the cathode by electrochemical reactions according to the ph during the reaction of aluminum the following monomeric and or polymeric species can be formed al oh 2 al oh 2 al2 oh 2 4 al oh 4 al6 oh 15 3 al7 oh 17 4 al8 oh 20 4 al13o4 oh 24 7 and al13 oh 34 5 until the conversion of these on al oh 3 s solid aluminum hydroxide aluminum hydroxide presents relatively high surface area able to promote adsorption of soluble organic compounds and imprisonment of colloidal particles with the formation of gelatinous flakes like the key reactions are as the following 11 12 eqs 1 and 2 1 anode al s al aq 3 3e 2 cathode 3h 2 o 3e 3 2h 2 3oh al3 and oh ions are formed by electrode reactions eqs 1 and 2 to create various monomeric types which finally converted to al oh 3 s according to the following equation eq 3 3 3h 2 o al aq 3 al oh 3 s 3h therefore with the application of an electrical current in ec sacrificial anodes are used to dose the water polluted with a coagulating agent such as aluminum hydroxide also gases stemming from the electrolysis of water usually o2 and h2 are generated in both electrodes with sufficient overpotentials capable of promoting the removal of the coagulated pollutants through flotation 13 many researchers around the world have conducted several studies with ec so far to assess the operational efficiency of the technique with various types of effluents from the textile industry 14 19 waters from the fishing industry 20 and poultry slaughterhouses 17 21 metallic industrial effluents 22 23 from mining 24 removal of oils and grease 11 25 26 wastewater from dairy products 27 28 and printing 29 and paper companies 30 according to moussa et al 31 the ec presents several parameters that directly influence the efficiency and removal of pollutants from the wastewater the most important parameters affecting the process are ph electrolyte concentration current density concentration of pollutant electrolysis time and electrode type 15 16 32 34 with that in mind the efficiency of a wastewater treatment process can be evaluated from different perspectives toxicity tests are desirable tools to evaluate water quality and wastewater pollutant concentration since only physical and chemical analyses the limits of which are established by environmental legislation are not able to distinguish substances that affect biological systems and inert substances to the environment and quality of waters the bioindicator d magna employed in the evaluation of the toxicity of chemical contaminants has some advantages performing in biotoxicity tests genetic stability representativeness of their trophic level evaluation of the acute and chronic effects of toxic chemicals and constant and elevated selectivity to contaminants 35 37 therefore chemical analyses and toxicity tests complement one another allowing for an integrated assessment of environmental quality of aquatic species 38 39 still textile effluents involving the use of dyes are often very complex and require intensive treatment it becomes important to evaluate not only the operational efficiency of effluent treatment but the toxicology of treated wastewater on the effects of a toxic agent on organisms according to exposure time and the life cycle of the organism the present study proposes the development of a methodology for treatments of synthetic wastewater from the textile industry with the presence of azo dye since the reactive dyes present in effluents from the textile industry are constituted by water soluble and colored substances for this purpose the efficiency of the ec in the treatment of synthetic textile effluents was evaluated through factorial planning physicochemical analysis parameters such as cod true color and toc the formation of residual aluminum from the experimental tests according to the experimental design adopted was also evaluated in relation to the study variables applied in the ec treatment azo dye concentration electrolyte concentration and current intensity the evaluation of toxic effects of synthetic effluent in the presence of azo dye employing the bioindicator d magna daphniidae was chosen for the evaluation of the mobility and or lethality of individuals through means of the ec50 test of median effective concentration therefore the main objective of this research was to evaluate i the efficiency of applying the ec in the treatment of synthetic textile effluent for the removal of azo dye in relation to cod toc and true color parameters ii the presence of residual aluminum resulting from the electro dissociation process of aluminum metal electrodes iii the effect of acute toxicity employing bioindicator d magna in the synthetic textile effluent in the presence of azo dye and in the effluent treated by the electrocoagulation process iv the operational parameters adopted in the experimental tests current intensity electrolyte concentration and concentration of azo dye and their influence on treatment efficiency via ec the effects on acute toxicity testing and residual aluminum formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental configuration for the application of the electrocoagulation process the descriptive scheme presented in fig 1 was used the experimental apparatus consists of using a source of continuous power labo 2845 115 vca with maximum current capacity of 5 0a and maximum voltage of 120 v and a borosilicate reactor uniglass model on a bench scale with net volume of 1 0 l the electrochemical cell was subjected to magnetic stirring microquÃ­mica mqama 301 at constant agitation speed of 600 rpm inside the reactor a monopolar system of aluminum electrodes as anode and cathode was installed with dimensions of 100 mm length 40 mm width and 1 mm thickness the electrodes were submerged at a depth of 78 mm providing a submerged surface area of 31 20 mm2 2 2 synthetic textile effluent ste the ste used in this study consists of applying reactive red 231 rr231 azo dye of difficult degradation employed in the dyeing process of the textile industry its chemical structure is characterized mainly by the presence of two azo groups as a chromophore group and two monoclorotriazyne groups as reactive groups as shown in fig 2 the synthetic effluent was prepared by dissolving the azoic dye in one liter 1 l of deionized water in the electrochemical reactor and diluted according to experimental tests adopted in each experiment 2 3 operational strategies the delimitation of the operational strategies for this study was based on preliminary ec tests evaluating the different concentrations of dye affected by the variation in electrolyte concentration and in the electrical current intensity eci applied to the process for 20 min of electrolysis the concentrations of dye were determined to simulate the nearest possible scenario of the properties of textile industry wastewater therefore operational strategies en adopted for this study are summarized in table 1 which presents electrolyte concentration 2 0 and 4 0 g l 1 dye

crustacean that acts in the aquatic food chain as a primary consumer feeding by filtration on the particulate organic material present in the medium 40 41 the tests were performed under the conditions of 20 2 c in an incubator chamber cienlab ce 300 350f with 16 hour light and 8 hour dark photoperiod with 400 lux intensities immobility and or lethality was observed after 48 h the test consists of exposing young individuals to pre established concentrations of the toxic agent for a period of 48 h with the objective of determining ec50 concentration that causes immobility to 50 of the exposed organisms the test results were statistically evaluated using the trimmed spearman karber method version 1 5 software cultivation maintenance and verification of organisms sensitivities were carried out in accordance with the recommendations of abnt nbr 12713 2016 and iso 6341 2012 standards 42 43 the cultivation method allows for the maintenance of test organisms in the laboratory aiming at maximizing reproduction minimizing mortality and maintaining sensitivity of organisms to evaluate the toxicity of water soluble chemicals the control tests with the d magna species negative control were carried out employing 20 ml of a distilled water test solution five individuals were added per replicate in quadruplicate all aged from 6 h to 24 h of life the tests were maintained at 20 c 2 c

under refrigeration at a temperature of 6 c 5 individuals were added per replication in quadruplicate all between 6 and 24 h of life the tests were based on the exposure of d magna neonates submitted

for windows version 7 0 statsoft 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect the ph turbidity and ts the efficiency of the ec was evaluated based on the determination of ph turbidity residual aluminum cod true color ts and cot relating to the operational variables adopted in this study current intensity electrolyte concentration and dye concentration results referring to the physicochemical analyses are summarized in table 2 the ste presented a turbidity value of 0 55 unt and after treatment presented a value of 1 47 unt in the e8 experimental test according to a study by khandegar and saroha 44 metallic ions formed at suitable ph constitute a wide range of coagulated species and metallic hydroxides that precipitate and adsorb dissolved contaminants or destabilize and add suspended particles during electrocoagulation this study observed an increase in the ph value from 4 34 for the synthetic textile effluent to ph values near neutrality 6 96 to 8 39 in the electrocoagulation process with aluminum electrodes the results corroborate those of the studies presented by verma 3 with an increase in the ph value for acid solutions ph 2 to 6 for textile wastewaters to final ph values from 7 0 to 8 0 being observed related to the increase of the concentration of hydroxide ions formed in the solution due to the speed of dissolution of the anode hence with aluminum being a lewis acid it establishes bonds with oh anions resulting in a buffer effect with final ph between 7 and 8 favoring the formation of monomeric and polymeric species that induce the presence of scanning flakes with fast absorption of soluble organic compounds 3 45 ghosh et al 46 in a study about the conditions of the chemical pre treatment process involving coagulation mechanisms point to effectiveness in turbidity reduction with ph values around 5 50 and 9 0 with constant maximum value in this study increased turbidity can be explained by the presence of flakes that are formed during the process due to high wear of aluminum metal electrodes according to a study by nÃºÃ±ez et al 47 employing the ec for a period of 20 min the maximum removal efficiency is 51 in this perspective a possible hypothesis for low efficiency in turbidity reduction may be because an amount of dye that stays present in residual water after electrochemical treatment can affect turbidity measurement 47 similarly the high electrical conductivity in aqueous medium implies an adverse effect in removing turbidity since elevated electrolyte concentrations can produce changes in the ionic force which in turn influences kinetics and balance between particle charges during reactions occurring throughout the process much the same way an ec operation with high values of electrical current intensity eci promotes accelerated wear of metal electrodes and increased consumption of electricity still higher than ideal values of eci lose efficiency to the process resulting in the formation of significant amounts of bubbles in the electrolytic cell thus the number of bubbles grows due to the incorporation of smaller bubbles coalescence a phenomenon that prevents aggregation from bubbles with contaminants in this respect a rise in eci promotes intensive formation of al3 ions in the effluent increasing the repulsive potential between charges resulting in increased turbidity and aluminum concentration in the treated effluent results from table 2 present a significant increment at the final concentration of total solids ts compared to the raw effluent sample in this respect the leaching aluminum in the effluent due to the wear of the metallic electrode is thought to have contributed to increased ts values in this scenario strategies e1 e4 e6 and e7 have shown highest wear of the electrodes which is directly associated with a 4 0a ec when it comes to ph values of the effluent the influence of this parameter in the ec is evidenced therefore the analysis of the solubility diagram of aluminum hydroxide implies that the amplitude of al3 hydrolysis depends on ph in view of the above the hydrolysis and polymerization of al3 in the ph range of 5 0 to 9 0 generate mononuclear species and or complex polynuclear aluminum such as for example al oh 3 al oh 2 al2 oh 4 e al17 oh 32 7 which are effective pollutant coagulants while in high ph values of the solution the dominant species is a oh 4 which obviously does not coagulate the pollutants and allows for lower efficiency in flocculation 48 49 likewise excessive agitation combined with high eci can promote an increment in ts values the associative effect of increasing stirring shear rate and eci values promotes the formation of hydrogen bubbles the presence of hydrogen bubbles motivates destabilization of flake structures and induces rupture and homogeneity in the process of contaminant agglutination resulting in the dissolution of organic compounds absorbed by the coagulant in the solution and consequently raising its concentration 50 3 2 cod toc and true color according to table 3 strategies in which concentrations of nacl were 2 0 g l 1 are thought to be more efficient in toc removal in the case of the ste the value was 657 63 mg l 1 that way the presence of salt is responsible for decreasing amounts of gas bubbles especially hydrogen bubbles floatability of smaller bubbles is slower when compared to larger bubbles and by slowly rising to the surface they collide with the contaminant which allows for an effective removal of the latter this way we point out that highly active chlorine species can form in such cases potentially capable of raising pollutant degradation rates these species include for example cl2 hclo and clo ions which may subsequently oxidize pollutants and at the same time chemically oxidize the anode material often these reactions can be beneficial since the performance of an ec reactor can be improved 51 52 in relation to results obtained for the true color parameter in experimental tests e1 and e2 it was observed color removal in the order of 96 5 and 95 7 in only 20 min of electrolysis as shown in fig 3 the operational condition proposed 4 0 a in this test provided an increase in the speed of ion transfer from the electrode to the aqueous medium favoring formation of the coagulant flocculant al oh 3 for color removal the contribution of cationic metal species generated through electrode dissolution has more affinity for anionic dyes because of the strong electrical attraction between negatively charged dyes and positively charged coagulants 18 furthermore the addition of nacl to increase conductivity may be responsible for generating free chlorine which eventually can reduce the effects of other anions such as sulfate and bicarbonate 53 results of the cod applying the ec promoted a reduction of 42 7 to 85 1 of the ste the strategies that obtained better efficiency in removing cod had 4 0 a the intensity applied determines the dosage of coagulant at the anode and the evolution of hydrogen gas at the cathode in addition bubble density affects the hydrodynamics of the system which in turn influences the mass transfer between pollutants coagulants and micro gas bubbles and ultimately dictates the collision rate of coagulated particles that results in floc formation 13 54 this increase in eci during the process allowed for a degradation of organic compounds present in the effluent which was proportional to the removal effect as well as the disruption of water molecules and consequent release of gases however experimental tests e1 and e6 showed a negative effect with the addition of a higher concentration of electrolyte 4 0 g l 1 resulting in an increased final cod of the system when compared to the concentration of 2 0 g l 1 as shown in table 3 addition of excess nacl to the solution causes adverse effects of other anions such as carbonates and sulfate ions the variation in electrolyte concentration in cod removal efficiency can be attributed to a change in ionic strength due to the change in the conductivity of the aqueous medium the ionic strength clearly affects the kinetics and balance of reactions between charged species that occur during ec 55 furthermore the presence of these ions allows for the precipitation of ca2 and mg2 ions responsible for the formation of a passivating layer on the electrode surface changing the electrical potential of the electrodes and consequently negatively affecting the efficiency of the system 17 56 maximum cod removal efficiency is not as high as the efficiencies found for color and toc removal comparing strategy e6 with e7 which had the same eci 4 a and the same nacl g l 1 concentration varying only in dye concentration 0 05 0 10 mg l 1 cod removal was shown to be less efficient when the dye concentration was 0 10 mg l 1 this fact can be attributed to the complex nature of the dye molecules which results in the lack of oxidation during the ec therefore dye molecules can still be found in the solution after treatment in fact it is known that the azo dyes used in the process are characterized by azo bonds n n and have so 3 and coo groups these dyes have high solubility and are not easily adsorbed therefore their presence negatively affects treatment performance in relation to cod removal 47 57 3 3 residual aluminum the concentration of residual aluminum from the ec showed variation in its values about post treatment and water quality as seen in fig 4 it was evidenced in all tests with aluminum electrodes an increase in the concentration of residual aluminum in the treated effluent with a value above the limit of 0 10 mg al l 1 as established in article 14 of conama resolution 357 2005 this phenomenon can be observed in strategy seven e7 using 4 0 a for both aluminum electrodes in this sense the e7 strategy presented a dissolved aluminum concentration of 36 02 mg l 1 indicating an increase of approximately 39 times the final concentration in relation to the concentration of 0 93 mg l 1 found for the ste in this regard for reactions with higher eci 4 a a considerable increase in electrode wear can be observed with an increase in the concentration of residual aluminum in the treated effluent as illustrated in fig 5 the same fact was observed in the study carried out by souza et al 58 using and comparing three different coagulants flocculants tannin pac and also4 and the ec for treatments of liquid effluents from a textile laundry however the amount of aluminum in the raw effluent was 17 95 mg l 1 after treatment by ec the aluminum concentration values increased reaching 58 60 mg l 1 in liquid medium and 42 93 mg l 1 in dry sludge kambuyi et al 59 reported that residual aluminum has a short residence time inside a continuous flow single channel cfsc reactor ec reactor in a process of electro dissolution but it is still quantified as material consumed by the process and remains dissolved in the treated water resulting in increased concentrations of residual aluminum the data obtained corroborate with the research developed by wellner et al 60 presenting residual aluminum concentration of 33 66 mg l 1 1 105 a and 500 mg nacl l 1 and residual aluminum concentration of 17 08 mg l 1 8 996 a and 5000 mg nacl l 1 as reported anode dissolution increased with increasing sodium chloride concentration therefore chemical dissolution phenomena of metallic electrodes occur by dissolving aluminum oxide coatings from the metallic surface in this context aqueous media containing chloride ions dissolved as salt can contribute to the dissolution of aluminum electrodes through corrosive pitting mechanisms that promote aggressive corrosive attacks of various shapes and depths that is the size and distribution of dots on the metallic surface of the aluminum electrode may be dependent on the concentration of sodium chloride 61 likewise the use of aluminum metal electrodes with high current intensity has the potential to increase the temperature of the electrochemical reaction promoting a retraction in al oh 3 flakes sizes which are more likely to be deposited on the surface of the electrode 12 the temperature increase observed in this research around 36 33 c for e2 and 82 c for the e7 test promotes an increase in aluminum solubility thus the increase in temperature has positive and negative effects on removal efficiency furthermore it is possible to state that the effect of temperature on the removal efficiency depends on the mechanism for pollutant removal 62 the amount of residual aluminum formed after the ec is a potential problem due to the formation of large amounts of dissolved aluminum after ec the presence of high concentrations of aluminum in water is considered a potential problem in the development of alzheimer s and neurodegenerative disease 3 4 acute toxicity test the results obtained in the acute toxicity tests in relation to synthetic raw effluent and the eight experimental tests via ec are presented in table 4 the results presented were obtained after 48 h of exposure of the bioindicator and the median effective concentration of the sample affecting 50 of the organisms tested ec50 in ascending order the smallest value of ec50 was obtained for the synthetic raw effluent 3 52 2 41 followed by test e8 5 87 1 35 the highest values presented for the mean effective concentration ec50 were obtained in the experimental test e2 40 24 2 26 the results presented show that the ec applied to synthetic textile effluent results in an increase in the ec50 value of ste reference the combination of variables electrolyte concentration 4 0 g l 1 dye concentration of 0 05 g l 1 and current intensity of 2 0 a provided an increase in the value of ec50 in 1043 18 and the combination of variables electrolyte concentration of 4 0 g l 1 dye concentration of 0 10 g l 1 and current intensity of 4 0 a was shown to increase ec50 value in 622 72 making the wastewater treated by the ec less toxic considering the exposure to the substance for a short period of time acute variation in results may occur due to factors such as sensitivity of the culture of the organisms used methodology for preparing the solution used in the test leaching of aluminum ions into the solution due to electro dissolution of metallic electrodes recalcitrant compounds formed in the ec among other factors the results in relation to tukey s test point to different lowercase letters in the same column and indicate a significant difference at the 5 level of significance by tukey s test data analysis regarding the median lethal concentration showed a significant difference in the data obtained using the anova statistical test tukey s test p 0 05 of the raw effluent in relation to the other experimental tests performed the data from experimental tests e1 e2 e3 and e4 suggest that increasing the concentration of electrolyte promotes a reduction in the toxic effect however the values corresponding to cod toc and residual aluminum are not in line with the data obtained in this study in this regard the increase in electrical conductivity of the solutions does not imply an increase in dye removal efficiency but only a reduction in the reactor s electrical energy consumption the data obtained is inconclusive indicating only that the synthetic effluent treatment process via ec presents less toxicity when compared to the raw synthetic effluent still toxicity was not eliminated indicating the possible presence of recalcitrant compounds toxic to those organisms that were not effectively removed by the ec the same fact was reported in the study by methneni et al 63 which evaluated the toxicity of effluents from three tunisian textile industries using four bioindicators including d magna in order to simulate different trophic levels the toxicity of d magna showed slightly lower values after treatment compared to the raw effluent even so the presence of persistent toxic agents was evidenced in the study conducted by alderete et al 64 evaluating the toxicity of the azo dye amido black 10b ab10b with d magna tests they obtained 100 immobility of the bioindicator after 24 and 48 h of exposure with ec50 values around 5 the high toxicity of the treated effluent may be associated with two by products generated with the cleavage of the azo bonds of ab10b 4 nitroaniline and 2 7 triamino 8 hydroxy 3 6 naphthalene disulfonate brambilla et al 65 achieved very similar results presenting excellent color removal from the effluent however the applied treatment technique favored the generation of recalcitrant by products of the cleavage of the nn bond of the azo dye with the production of potentially toxic amines generating high toxicity after treatment the wear of metallic electrodes caused by high eci 4a the increase in temperature of the electrochemical reaction and the presence of chloride ions derived from the nacl electrolyte potentially favor the electro dissolution of aluminum ions and the consequent increase in toxic effects meanwhile the toxicity observed in this study may be associated with the complex structure of the dye and the production via electro dissolution of al3 ion species responsible for the generation of recalcitrant by products 4 conclusion this work aimed to investigate the efficiency of treating a synthetic textile effluent applying ec under different operating conditions the ec presented maximum removal efficiency of true color toc and cod of 96 5 93 5 and 85 1 respectively thus suiting the environmental legislation relative to the conditions and standards of effluent release for true color and cod conama resolution no 357 2005 and cema resolution no 0070 2009 the best operating conditions for the ec were with a 4 0 a current intensity and 2 0 g l 1 of electrolyte however it was observed in this study that values of 4 a employed for the ec promoted a marked electrodissolution reaction on the metallic aluminum electrodes forming al3 chemical species responsible for the presence of residual aluminum in the acute toxicity tests despite minor changes to the analyzed parameters significant effects p 0 05 were made evident in the test organisms used in the raw effluent relative to the ec treatment applied in the experimental tests with 95 confidence granting unsafe values for the aquatic biota therefore the adjustment to the experimental operating parameters and the combination with the use of absorption techniques to remove residual aluminum and other recalcitrant by products generated during the ec may aid the decision making for a better configuration of the textile
