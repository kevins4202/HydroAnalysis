16260,a meta analysis of existing and available illumina 16s rrna datasets from drinking water source treatment and drinking water distribution systems dwds were collated to compare changes in abundance and diversity throughout samples from bulk water and biofilm were used to assess principles governing microbial community assembly and the value of amplicon sequencing to water utilities individual phyla relationships were explored to identify competitive or synergistic factors governing dwds microbiomes the relative importance of stochasticity in the assembly of the dwds microbiome was considered to identify the significance of source and treatment in determining communities in dwds treatment of water significantly reduces overall species abundance and richness with chlorination of water providing the most impact to individual taxa relationships the assembly of microbial communities in the bulk water of the source primary treatment process and dwds is governed by more stochastic processes as is the dwds biofilm dwds biofilm is significantly different from bulk water in terms of local contribution to beta diversity type and abundance of taxa present water immediately post chlorination has a more deterministic microbial assembly highlighting the significance of this process in changing the microbiome although elevated levels of stochasticity in dwds samples suggest that this may not be the case at customer taps 16s rrna sequencing is becoming more routine and may have several uses for water utilities including detection and risk assessment of potential pathogens such as those within the genera of legionella and mycobacterium assessing the risk of nitrification in dwds providing improved indicators of process performance and monitoring for significant changes in the microbial community to detect contamination combining this with quantitative methods like flow cytometry will allow a greater depth of understanding of the dwds microbiome

safety of drinking water supplies is of paramount importance for public health and water utilities are responsible for the treatment and delivery of potable water while treatment is highly effective at removing traditional faecal indicator organisms the microbial challenge remains significant as water borne disease outbreaks associated with drinking water distribution systems dwds still have significant public health implications and these may not always correlate with traditional water quality metrics fricker and eldred 2009 jalava et al 2014 leclerc et al 2001 payment and locas 2011 saxena et al 2015 for example in 1998 an outbreak of campylobacteriosis in northern finland was not detected by routine water quality samples contamination occurred during a routine repair to a mains pipe leading to acute gastroenteritis in over 200 people kuusi et al 2005 to prevent outbreaks like these improved methods of detection in distribution and treatment of drinking water are required water treatment has traditionally been a 3 stage process coagulation of colloidal material using a metallic salt subsequent filtration through rapid gravity sand filters and disinfection using a chlorine based biocide this remains the most common method of treatment in many countries there are several other treatment strategies that are now used which satisfy drinking water regulations including slow sand filtration biological filtration ozonation and membrane filtration filtration and disinfection are the primary barriers to the presence of harmful pathogens in drinking water water quality regulations on the microbial safety of dwds focus on the likelihood of faecal contamination using the presence of coliform bacteria as a surrogate for the wide range of pathogens potentially present in faeces these are measured using culture based tests that isolate and enumerate coliforms and e coli specifically these methods have been broadly unchanged for over 100 years compliance with these metrics is high in the uk 99 9 dwi 2020 although isolated sporadic and low level total coliform detections remain a problem for utilities often without an attributable cause these indicators are now known to be problematic for several reasons more than 99 of bacteria are unculturable hahn et al 2019 rappé and giovannoni 2003 there are also emerging non faecal pathogens in drinking water e g mycobacterium and legionella species and the correlation between total coliforms and other pathogenic indicators is poor cabral 2010 payment and locas 2011 savichtcheva and okabe 2006 moreover routine culture tests assess a small volume 100 ml and a confirmed result takes over two days meaning that poor quality water will have already passed into the dwds well before a result is returned quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr methods are capable of identification of target organisms within a few hours but are limited in the amount of information they give about the overall microbiome there is therefore a need for additional high throughput methods of microbial characterisation to assess the diversity of microbial communities across space and time these approaches will need to move beyond the limitations of day to day testing for specific pathogenic microbes while assessing changes in the microbiome at a macro level over a long term period to manage dwds proactively 16s rrna amplicon sequencing technology can be used to characterise and identify microbial communities in dwds across space and time while the taxonomic resolution that can be achieved depends on the 16s rrna hypervariable region sequenced and the type and abundance of the taxa detected fox and reid bayliss 2014 the approach has been widely applied in academia since circa 2010 to explore microbial communities of drinking water to both assess diversity and identify groups of microbes of concern to public health this method has broad advantages over qpcr in the large amount of taxonomic information that it provides although it is non quantitative and unable to determine cell viability most 16s rrna studies are discrete across a single or few dwds within a geographical area they also tend to focus on one part of a system e g source waters efficacy of treatment processes variations of biofilm communities in space time or operating conditions within a pipe distribution network influences of domestic plumbing arrangements or differences between the bulk water and biofilm communities ahmed et al 2015 bautista de los santos et al 2016 bautista de los santos et al 2016 chan et al 2019 de vera et al 2018 douterelo et al 2019 2017 fish and boxall 2018 gerrity et al 2018 ghaju shrestha et al 2017 gülay et al 2016 han et al 2020 hou et al 2018 lautenschlager et al 2014 liu et al 2017b lührig et al 2015 mccoy and vanbriesen 2012 potgieter et al 2018 potgieter and pinto 2019 prest et al 2014 shaw et al 2015 uyaguari diaz et al 2019 vierheilig et al 2015 vignola et al 2018 wan et al 2019 wang et al 2014 2013 wolf baca and piekarska 2020 wu et al 2014 zhu et al 2019 while several of these studies have provided new insight into drinking water microbiomes they tend to be descriptive and not predictive add to this variability in the methods used to construct amplicon libraries e g dna extraction 16s rrna hypervariable region and sequencing platform and the complex system specific nature of dwds and it becomes difficult to build a general understanding of how drinking water microbial communities change from source to tap 16s rrna studies have shown the treatment of drinking water in general reduces the abundance and diversity of micro organisms present yet a diverse microbiome remains in potable water including genera containing pathogenic species the drinking water microbiome at customer taps may be influenced by a range of factors including source water treatment flow conditions and dwds biofilms water treatment has been proposed to have a deterministic effect selecting microbes that survive filtration and disinfection processes pinto et al 2012 lin et al 2014 this effect is likely to reduce with distance and time from treatment where biofilm growth and disturbance become more prominent at this point stochastic random effects may be more likely to govern the assembly of microbial communities due to the complexity of the local environments the importance of stochastic factors like birth death and immigration are known to be important in shaping many prokaryotic communities sloan et al 2006 thus drinking water microbiomes are dynamic through treatment time and location to aid water utilities to deliver safe potable water a deeper understanding of these changes consequences and impact on both the microbiome and the prevalence of pathogens is needed 1 1 aims and objectives here we present a meta analysis of 16s rrna studies from source to tap to explore global distribution and commonalities in the drinking water microbiomes we further consider the contribution and potential of 16s rrna amplicon sequencing as an analytical tool for water utilities research has suggested that 16s rrna amplicon sequencing is beneficial in assessing risk to public health in dwds although there are many areas for further investigation to understand the implications of the results vierheilig et al 2015 the specific aims of this meta analysis were to identify commonalities in dwds microbiomes across the world which can be used to further understanding of water quality for utilities to understand the relative importance of the deterministic effects of source and treatment on the microbiomes of dwds and explore key relationships between phyla present 2 methods 2 1 data gathering a search for all papers since 2010 using the following terms 16s rrna and water was carried out using scopus this search returned 176 results each result was individually assessed to ascertain its relevance to this meta analysis only studies using illumina miseq or hiseq platforms were included to minimise the different errors and biases associated with alternative sequencing platforms such as nanopore ion torrent or older technologies used before 2010 such as pyrosequencing d amore et al 2016 schirmer et al 2015 after this manual filter 44 studies remained and were checked to ascertain sequence data availability 26 studies had publicly available raw sequence data for the remainder data was requested only one study responded a list of the papers used in the analysis can be found in the supplementary information table s1 including relevant study and sample information all raw data downloads used the sra toolkit provided by ncbi except for one study from qiita metadata for samples from ncbi s run selector included sequencing platform the hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene sequenced sample i d sample date and time and geolocation other relevant metadata was recorded from the published research sample location disinfection type if applicable and whether the sample was from bulk water or biofilm before processing studies were grouped by the hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene sequenced in total 27 studies with 1750 samples from over 50 different dwds were compared an overview of data processing steps can be seen in figure 1 2 2 sequence processing qiime2 processed collated amplicon sequences for each platform and hypervariable v region in earth microbiome project paired end sequencing format fastq and was used to generate amplicon sequencing variants asvs qiime2 improves qiime1 in terms of quality control of sequences using dada2 and deblur software both of which were employed here to provide enough overlap of forward and reverse reads to facilitate paired end reads dada2 was employed where amplicons were 250bp long and the quality score was 20 for amplicons spanning multiple v regions deblur commands allowed for the pairing of longer amplicons without significant loss of sequence length as an explicit threshold is not required output alpha diversity profiles may be significantly different when using different denoising software to generate asvs nearing et al 2018 so runs of deblur and dada2 were carried out for all regions and platforms and compared the final analyses generated 3 32 108 demultiplexed reads in total from 2098 samples to identify the best taxonomic assignment abundance tables and phylogenetic tree files from qiime2 had taxonomy assigned using three approaches these were naïve bayesian classification system nbc bayesian least common ancestor blca approach using silva138 database and the taxass database taxass uses silva to generate a first pass of taxonomic assignment then a curated database of freshwater sequences to assign the remainder of asvs blca and silva138 were selected for downstream statistical processing as this method provided the highest level of taxonomic recovery to the genus level table s2 finally asvs from all v regions were collated together in a single abundance table asvs without sequence level resolution were removed so that full length 16s rrna sequences could be obtained for all sequences as per the method used by keating et al keating et al 2020 of the 1 27 108 sequences originally classified by silva138 from the individual datasets 1 08 108 were classified to sequence level that is 84 89 of these sequences 22574 were unique taxa generation of the final phylogenetic tree and abundance table with taxonomy was again processed in qiime2 the collation methodology applied in this meta analysis is limited in that only full length sequences already present in the silva database are included this may lead to bias towards these sequences in total from our data base 15 11 of sequences were not present in silva with sequence level resolution however without the collation strategy 16s rrna amplicon sequencing datasets of different hypervariable regions cannot be pooled and compared despite the loss of these sequences the overall beta diversity patterns present in the uncollated and collated datasets were largely preserved as shown by mantel and procrustes analyses supportinginformation figs s1 s12 only one region platform correlated poorly miseq and v3 due to differences in the abundances of 2 uncultured sequences between the datasets where the rest of the 25 most abundant taxa were identical this means that the between sample diversity patterns for collated and uncollated samples were highly similar indicating that the removed sequences were in low abundance and unlikely to disproportionally affect the results 2 3 statistical analyses the collated abundance table with taxonomy phylogenetic tree and metadata was then processed using the microbiome seq packages r meta sample groupings defined the sample location in the treatment and distribution process and if the sample originated from biofilm or bulk water samples from sediments and wastewater streams were removed at this stage giving a final sample number of 1750 shannon and richness indexes were calculated for each meta grouping to estimate alpha diversity diversity within a sample core microbiome analysis of the collated datasets was carried out in the bioconductor package using an absolute detection method and a minimum prevalence of 85 for all groups except dwds and untreated water groups these groups had significantly more samples and required a higher threshold of 95 lahti et al 2017 beta diversity or between sample diversity metrics were more complicated to assess given the substantial number of samples in the final analysis n 1750 their varying environments as well as spatial and temporal locations instead calculation of local contribution to beta diversity lcbd for each group was made legendre and de cáceres 2013 the nearest taxon index nti and net relatedness index nri from the picante package in r http kembellab ca r workshop biodivr sk biodiversity r html were used to quantify environmental filtering on community assembly to estimate the relative impacts of ecological determinism and stochasticity on the assembly of the curated microbiomes a null modelling approach was adopted using a general framework defined by ning et al 2019 using simulated bacterial communities and further applied to real communities nikolova et al 2021 ning et al 2019 trego et al 2021 normalised and modified stochasticity ratios nst and mst were calculated for all groups within the dataset in this approach deterministic processes are expected to drive species more similar or dissimilar than the null expectation nst values are quantified from the difference between the expected similarity and dissimilarity and the actual values higher nst mst above 0 5 values indicate more deterministic factors influencing community assembly lower values below 0 5 indicate more stochastic influences patterns in beta diversity may not be continual as multiple relationships may affect an organism at a specific time or place therefore a new methodology was employed using boolean patterns to assess relationships between individual asvs in all meta sample groups golovko et al 2020 this uses a pattern specific method to identify relationships between 2 asvs at a defined threshold including one way relationships co occurrence and co exclusion this method can also quantify 3 dimensional relationships between asvs these are categorised as all alone type 1 co exclusion exclusion of asv1 by asv2 and 3 type 2 co exclusion presence of asv2 and asv3 if asv1 is present and finally all three together this method was applied to the asvs in the dataset to identify any significant relationships at a phyla level 3 results 3 1 taxonomic profile sequence level classification was resolved for a total of 22754 asvs the 25 most abundant genera are shown in figure 2 in the final analysis 111 samples were from dwds bulk water the largest meta sample group bulk water from different dwds as expected was variable with differences in the abundances of the top 25 genera however there does appear to be some commonalities in taxa among dwds with the same disinfectant residual nitrosomonas and pseudomonas were more abundant in systems using a chloraminated residual pathogenic microbes such as mycobacterium were common in both chlorinated and chloraminated dwds biofilm samples in distribution were less numerous n 159 and had a much higher taxonomic diversity than the bulk water pseudomonas was common in many samples in both chlorinated and chloraminated biofilms but less so in those with no disinfectant residual samples from water sources and treatment systems made up a much smaller proportion of the dataset and differed from dwds in terms of the most abundant taxa again the most common genera in dwds were less abundant in source and treatment except nitrospira which was more abundant throughout treatment than in dwds a member of burkholderiales limnohabitans was also present throughout treatment and highly abundant in one bulk water dwds study source untreated water samples were generally from surface waters although a small proportion came from groundwater several untreated water samples show similar taxonomic profiles to each other globally all untreated water samples were highly diverse in comparison to treated water 3 2 alpha diversity core microbiome analysis of collated datasets the amount of diversity within each sample or alpha diversity can be seen in fig 3 c across the different sample groups the within sample richness values were significantly different the highest degree of sequence diversity in terms of richness and shannon index values came from untreated water a reduction in these values was evident in the treatment and dwds groups in biofilm and bulk water biofilm samples have elevated shannon values compared to bulk water although richness was similar core microbiome analysis of this collated dataset figure 3 a b proposed several prevalent taxa within more than one sample group although the overall taxa prevalence was reduced in distribution samples pseudomonas was the most commonly abundant taxa and was present at all stages of water treatment and in dwds biofilm nitrospira was prevalent within water treatment works bulk water and biofilm legionella was abundant in bulk water only in untreated and in treatment samples the only taxa prevalent throughout all bulk water and biofilm groups was an uncultured rubinisphaeraceae 3 3 local contribution to beta diversity and environmental filtering due to the unequal data classes and high degrees of spatial and temporal variation estimates of beta diversity used local contribution to beta diversity lcbd for all meta sample groups fig 4 rather than a direct measure lcbd values were only above the significance threshold for two categories when calculated using unifrac distance untreated water and distribution biofilm for bray curtis all groups had greater than the calculated threshold lcbd 0 00057 except distribution water with dwds biofilm and treated water samples having the highest values the untreated and water treatment works groups were very close to the significance threshold unifrac shows a pattern of reducing lcbd in bulk water throughout treatment and distribution whereas biofilm groups increase again in dwds samples bray curtis measures show a pattern of increasing lcbd in bulk water samples from untreated to treated water which then reduces in dwds lcbd in biofilm samples increased throughout treatment to a maximum in dwds nti and nri values for the meta sample groups were similar except for untreated water which was the only category with values 0 indicating the taxa present are more dissimilar than in the other categories biofilm in dwds had a higher nti than that of bulk water indicating that species relatedness is higher in biofilm 3 4 null modelling the nst and mst displayed in fig 5 quantify the relative importance of stochasticity for each meta sample group phylogenetic distances were calculated using jaccard with and without abundances ruzicka approach both measures produced comparable results nst values of 0 5 are more stochastic than deterministic the highest nst values were in dwds bulk water 0 71 followed closely by dwds biofilm samples 0 59 bulk water samples before and throughout treatment up to disinfection were also more stochastic than deterministic 0 53 and 0 58 only two of the groups had more deterministic values treated water 0 46 and biofilm in the water treatment works which had the most deterministic value 0 43 mst values modified ratio are much lower showing a similar pattern of values except with untreated water which has the highest most stochastic value 0 38 3 5 boolean relationships the results of the boolean analysis to identify individual relationships between asvs in the dataset at 2 and 3 dimensional levels are displayed in fig 6 the analysis identified 257 relationships between individual phyla across all stages of the treatment and distribution process many of which were present across several groups most of the relationships found were one way although there were 21 three dimensional relationships across all groups these were predominantly found in untreated water treatment and treated water groups treated water and bulk in water in dwds had the least number of relationships 11 and 17 respectively and no three dimensional relationships were found in the dwds group untreated water had 5 type 2 co exclusionary relationships detected if asv1 then asv2 and 3 are absent desulfobacterota was involved in 3 of these types of relationships with bdellovibrionata and cyanobacteria cyanobacteria were also involved in several co exclusionary relationships across the dataset and part of the only type 2 co exclusionary relationship detected within the dwds biofilm group with desulfobacterota and patescibacteriota many of cyanobacteria s relationships were maintained across the groups with both one way and co exclusion being most common with one exception cyanobacteria were found to be in a co presence relationship with bacteroidetes and planctomycetes in treated water one of only 13 relationships detected for this group 4 discussion 4 1 principles governing microbiomes in dwds taxonomic profiles of the various meta sample groups identified significant differences in abundances of genera throughout the source treatment and distribution of water there were high degrees of species richness and alpha diversity of taxa in source waters that then reduced throughout treatment processes this reduction is consistent with both the individual studies included in this analysis and several other pyrosequencing studies bautista de los santos et al 2016 pinto et al 2014 potgieter and pinto 2019 the reduction in lcbd in bulk water from untreated to treated water samples using unifrac supports the reduction in alpha diversity and richness a wide scale study of 49 dwds in china suggested reduced diversity and richness in tap compared to source waters han et al 2020 the similarity of taxa increases throughout treatment and distribution sample groups indicative of selective processes driven by filtration and chlorination which only some organisms can survive hou et al 2018 lautenschlager et al 2014 vignola et al 2018 wan et al 2019 wang et al 2014 however lcbd values using bray curtis dissimilarities increased across these groups showing precisely the opposite pattern it should be noted that unifrac measures include information on phylogenetic relatedness which bray curtis does not this highlights that beta diversity patterns throughout water treatment are incredibly complex and should be interpreted using several metrics modelling of microbiomes now concentrates on the relative importance of random events on assembly such as births deaths and environmental disturbance this is compared to more traditional view that deterministic events such as selection drive communities sloan et al 2006 as treatment and source choice may be significant in determining the organisms in the treated water this is an important measure to consider all meta sample groups except treated water and distributed biofilm had more stochastic values suggesting a greater degree of randomness in microbiome assembly in these groups however samples immediately after disinfection with chlorine treated water had a more deterministic value proteobacteria in particular pseudomonas actinobacter and rheinheimera have been demonstrated to dominate post disinfection supporting the deterministic influence of treatment becerra castro et al 2016 it also suggests that although filtration is important in defining taxa in dwds chlorine has a more strongly selective effect this is supported by a study comparing two identical treatment systems treating the same source water where chlorine and chloramine produced different bacterial communities potgieter and pinto 2019 in 2016 a meta analysis of 14 pyrosequencing studies of water distribution systems compared the bacterial communities present under different disinfectant regimes also confirming that the microbial communities in dwds without a free chlorine residual are more diverse and abundant than those containing free chlorine mycobacterium and pseudomonas were significantly reduced by the presence of a free chlorine residual in that research bautista de los santos et al 2016 in contrast this meta analysis found mycobacterium was highly abundant in dwds containing free chlorine and chloramine but less so in those containing free chlorine residuals pseudomonas was only highly abundant in biofilm samples but absent in bulk water it was more abundant in samples containing free chlorine than chloramine these differences may be due to sequencing technology sample availability and sample site characteristics and further highlight the complexity of interactions in the microbiomes of dwds these results do agree that pseudomonas and mycobacterium are important members of dwds communities in general however and should be explored further to determine how these may be minimised particularly considering their public health implications this will be explored later in the discussion bulk water in dwds had the lowest lcbd using both metrics the sharp reduction in lcbd in dwds compared with at the outlet of the treatment process treated water suggests that although treatment is important in reducing diversity time and space are important in shaping beta diversity patterns in dwds water this is consistent with several previous studies on dwds microbial communities where temporal fluctuation had a significant impact on communities mccoy and vanbriesen 2012 prest et al 2014 there may also be potential diurnal cycles in bulk water potentially due to flow patterns bautista de los santos et al 2016 many studies have also suggested that communities within dwds are unique to that system influenced by the source and treatment characteristics potgieter and pinto 2019 wu et al 2014 although the results presented here suggest that while the members of the community may be unique there is a general reduction in beta diversity from treated to dwds bulk water indicating the efficacy of these processes biofilm samples have a much higher lcbd than that of bulk water these groups are also quite different in terms of types and abundance of taxa a finding shared by individual studies douterelo et al 2019 2017 liu et al 2017b lührig et al 2015 the core microbiome analysis for both these groups had only one organism in common and the dwds samples had lower abundances this suggests that biofilm microbiomes contribute more to overall biodiversity within the pipe than the bulk water samples this is important to consider as the biofilm contains a quite different microbial profile than that of the bulk water and sampling only bulk water may give a limited picture of the overall microbiome this might lead to missed opportunities to detect pathogens as aforementioned pseudomonas was the most abundant organism within biofilm but absent in bulk water this is consistent with pseudomonas as a primary coloniser of water biofilms doǧruöz et al 2009 biofilm deposition is known to influence bulk water communities when loose deposits or biofilm are disturbed douterelo et al 2019 2017 liu et al 2017a biofilms can also significantly contribute to microbial loading in dwds with the composition affected by the presence of a chlorine residual fish and boxall 2018 these results were supported in this study by the high number of relationships evident between phyla in biofilm compared to bulk water 71 17 relationships identified this in addition to the elevated nri and nti values suggest complex interactions define the assembly of biofilm communities a null modelling approach was also adopted to assess the importance of ecological stochasticity on the assembly of the microbiomes using the nst and mst ratios ning et al 2019 assessing the relative importance of stochasticity has been applied to crude oil degrading marine bacterioplankton and anaerobic digestor communities using this approach and has been useful in understanding their assembly nikolova et al 2021 trego et al 2021 the biofilm group from water treatment works had an nst value below 0 5 indicating than deterministic effects are more prominent in these samples as they are close to null expectation although dwds biofilm had more stochastic values with higher nst values than the bulk water samples these samples are more similar or dissimilar than the null expectation the results from this dataset further supports the hypothesis that the effects of treatment and source reduce with distance and time from treatment han et al 2020 pinto et al 2014 potgieter et al 2018 the strong selective pressures exerted by treatment processes therefore may be less important in dwds the increased stochasticity in the dwds group could be due to many environmental factors including genetic drift the historical effects of treatment and source water on the assembly of the community including priority effects the material and conditions within the pipe affecting dispersal and flow conditions within the dwds this has been demonstrated by laboratory experiments using experimental pipe loops with the same influent water under different flow rates the resulting biofilms contained some shared core taxa but with differences in their relative abundances influenced by the flow conditions within each loop douterelo et al 2017 environmental impacts like priority effects drift dispersal and dispersal limitations may therefore be important factors in dwds communities these are important considerations in microbial assembly zhou and ning 2017 long term studies of discrete systems would be required to assess these impacts at various temporal scales identification of significant one two and three way relationships between individual phyla in the meta sample groups also demonstrates the complexity of dwds microbiomes 246 two dimensional relationships were detected across all sample groups the majority of these being one way there were also 21 three dimensional relationships these were particularly conserved across sample groups with desulfobacterota cyanobacteria and bdellovibrionata forming co exclusionary relationships in several groups cyanobacteria were also found to exclude bacteroidetes in biofilm dwds bacteroidetes is a phylum that contains pathogenic microbes and while there are 6 orders within this phylum consisting of over 7000 species the presence of these relationships suggests that further exploration of the abundance of these phyla is required thomas et al 2011 it would be ideal to be able to assess these boolean relationships at a lower taxonomic resolution but due to the significant increase in the number of relationships and reduced confidence values at lower levels phylum provided the best resolution for this large data set more targeted studies with a smaller sample size may be able to provide higher taxonomic resolution to explore important taxa relationships further 4 2 applying 16s rrna amplicon sequencing for water utilities as expected the 25 most abundant taxa in the combined analysis did not contain any organisms traditionally used to indicate contamination as these should be in low abundance in treated water there were no coliforms identified in the core microbiome analysis or taxa profile for any meta sample groups a few genera of enterobacteria were detected in the most abundant taxa profiles from the individual datasets before collation supporting information figs s7 s10 citrobacter kluyvera and enterobacter all members of the coliform group were detected in a small number of samples from 2 studies 20 and shigella was detected in 1 sample this further suggests that coliforms are in general in low abundance in water systems under normal operating conditions it should be noted that analysis of untreated water samples in isolation failed to identify any highly abundant enterobacteriaceae their low abundance in source waters may mean that 16s rrna amplicon sequencing is not appropriate for the detection of traditional indicator organisms these results also suggested indicators are not a part of the microbiome under normal operating conditions although whether their detection is truly indicative of contamination was not assessed coliform bacteria are considered indicators of process performance rather than faecal contamination except e coli due to their prevalence in some environments and lack of correlation to other enteric pathogens ishii et al 2006 ishii and sadowsky 2008 savichtcheva and okabe 2006 this study further suggests that their overall lack of abundance in untreated water makes them a poor indicator of process performance this analysis did reveal some organisms of concern as abundant in dwds although different organisms were of concern in different dwds consistent with the proposed system specific nature of dwds microbiomes roeselers et al 2015 of note mycobacterium was abundant in both chlorinated and chloraminated dwds but was not prevalent in non chlorinated dwds samples mycobacterium is an emerging pathogen of concern for water utilities and dominates in some dwds ashbolt 2015 zhu et al 2019 nitrosomonas and nitrospira were also highly prevalent in the biofilm of chloraminated dwds and an abundant member in several groups core microbiome analysis supporting the results of individual studies highlighting their importance chan et al 2019 shaw et al 2015 monitoring the relative abundance of organisms like nitrosomonas and nitrospira using 16s rrna amplicon sequencing may help utilities assess the risk of nitrification within chloraminated dwds nitrite is an important regulatory parameter but nitrification also indicates that disinfection levels are not sufficient to prevent microbial regrowth monitoring these groups of bacteria may help utilities intervene in dwds before these issues become significant through mains repair flushing or replacement if water utilities can optimise processes to select for non pathogenic microbes this can reduce the risk of illness from drinking water something suggested in several studies douterelo et al 2019 2017 fish and boxall 2018 an overview of microbial communities dynamics as ascertained by 16s rrna amplicon analysis provides a holistic view of the response of water treatment and dwds on microbiology this understanding will aid risk management to maintain water quality and reduce the likelihood of harmful pathogens entering the system 16s rrna studies are becoming more popular and routine for the molecular analysis of water treatment and distribution as demonstrated here they provide extensive information revealing diverse communities that are influenced by the treatment process however translating this information into practice to inform and predict water quality is not always obvious to water utilities however taking a global meta analysis view this analysis highlighted several ways in which water utilities might employ 16s rrna sequencing to improve drinking water quality considering whole microbial community dynamics from source to water bulk and biofilm this review has identified several organisms highly abundant throughout source and treatment that can be potentially used to benchmark performance and monitor risk as aforementioned pseudomonas and mycobacterium were all abundant in dwds while legionella was abundant in the source and treatment groups members of this genus are known pathogens of concern for drinking water quality in particular the higher abundance of the genus legionella in source waters and treatment in this analysis may make it a good indicator of treatment performance especially as other studies have detected legionella in treated water samples ashbolt 2015 hou et al 2018 vignola et al 2018 legionella is an emerging pathogen of concern to the water industry and in the uk may be included in future water quality regulations the legionella genus contains 71 species only a few of which are pathogenic with legionella pneumophilae being of most concern doleans et al 2004 garrity et al 2005 in this meta analysis 67 different sequences were assigned to legionella species including l pneumophilae l longbeachae and l bozemanii these species account for 96 3 of cases of legionellosis worldwide doleans et al 2004 therefore amplicon sequencing can aid water utilities to assess the risk of legionellosis from water systems although the viability of the organisms detected must also be considered using an alternative method flow cytometry fcm may provide the appropriate information to compliment 16s rrna sequencing using fcm with the intercalating dyes sybr green and propidium iodide to stain genetic material in situ within a sample gives a quantitative measure of the intact cells within the microbiome of dwds this is due to the ability of sybr green to permeate intact cell membranes whereas propidium iodide cannot dead cells therefore appear red where intact cells fluoresce green allowing each to be distinguished this approach has been extensively explored in studies assessing water treatment cell removal dwds regrowth and seasonal changes within microbiomes besmer and hammes 2016 hammes et al 2010 hassard et al 2019 prest et al 2016 fcm can also provide more information than just the count of cells within a sample using the relative fluorescence and a statistical binning process cells can be grouped into populations which can then be tracked favere et al 2020 props et al 2016 a quantitative measure like the ratio of intact cells to the total count of cells within a sample could be used by utilities to quantify the viability of the organisms identified using a 16s rrna amplicon sequencing enhancing the benefits of both analyses measures of species richness and abundance such as alpha diversity and lcbd at treatment and distribution stages are useful to water utilities when comparing dwds performance although monitoring the relative abundance of specific taxa in a single dwds may not be able to detect a risk to public health directly an understanding of these values across different dwds allow water utilities to assess the impacts of source treatment and distribution conditions on water quality and make more informed choices on asset investment understanding the relative impacts of ecological stochasticity in dwds microbiomes is also a useful exercise for water utilities higher stochastic values in bulk water and biofilm of dwds samples in this analysis suggest that random events are more important than treatment processes or other prior deterministic events in determining the bacterial communities in contrast biofilm communities in the water treatment works and bulk treated water groups are more deterministic affected by the prior treatment processes and presence of a high chlorine residual managing biofilm and ensuring treatment processes remove microbes of concern is where water utilities can most effectively minimise risk to public health this discussion has focussed primarily on the results from dwds as this provided the largest proportion of the available data there is a need to sample further at source and throughout treatment processes to explore the ecological rules and relationships between taxa at these stages and their subsequent impact on assembly of microbiomes in the dwds this is a particularly important question for water utilities so that they can improve treatment and distribution processes 5 conclusions there are copious quantities of data from amplicon sequencing studies in dwds although many of these studies provide only a descriptive understanding of the microbiomes as a result this information has yet to be used to predict and direct microbial water quality there has been a reluctance to adopt sequencing technology among water utilities as the benefits are not immediately clear using a meta analysis of 16s rrna amplicons we have shown that while treatment and distribution of water significantly reduce the diversity and abundance of taxa present in the source the subsequent assembly of microbiomes in drinking water is a stochastic process particularly in the dwds this suggests that the effects of source and treatment diminish with distance and time in bulk water only the assembly of microbiomes at the point of chlorination is more deterministic due to selection pressures on organisms that cannot survive oxidation although 16s rrna amplicon sequencing cannot satisfy current water quality regulation it can assess the risk from emerging pathogens such as legionella or mycobacterium or biofilm colonisers like pseudomonas which may be in high abundance in dwds amplicon sequencing can also track significant changes in the microbiome associated with contamination or changes in process performance these are benefits traditional culture tests cannot provide however further work is required to standardise sequencing and data analysis methods for 16s rrna amplicon sequencing methods to enable the water industry to adopt them as standard practice declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements

16260,a meta analysis of existing and available illumina 16s rrna datasets from drinking water source treatment and drinking water distribution systems dwds were collated to compare changes in abundance and diversity throughout samples from bulk water and biofilm were used to assess principles governing microbial community assembly and the value of amplicon sequencing to water utilities individual phyla relationships were explored to identify competitive or synergistic factors governing dwds microbiomes the relative importance of stochasticity in the assembly of the dwds microbiome was considered to identify the significance of source and treatment in determining communities in dwds treatment of water significantly reduces overall species abundance and richness with chlorination of water providing the most impact to individual taxa relationships the assembly of microbial communities in the bulk water of the source primary treatment process and dwds is governed by more stochastic processes as is the dwds biofilm dwds biofilm is significantly different from bulk water in terms of local contribution to beta diversity type and abundance of taxa present water immediately post chlorination has a more deterministic microbial assembly highlighting the significance of this process in changing the microbiome although elevated levels of stochasticity in dwds samples suggest that this may not be the case at customer taps 16s rrna sequencing is becoming more routine and may have several uses for water utilities including detection and risk assessment of potential pathogens such as those within the genera of legionella and mycobacterium assessing the risk of nitrification in dwds providing improved indicators of process performance and monitoring for significant changes in the microbial community to detect contamination combining this with quantitative methods like flow cytometry will allow a greater depth of understanding of the dwds microbiome

safety of drinking water supplies is of paramount importance for public health and water utilities are responsible for the treatment and delivery of potable water while treatment is highly effective at removing traditional faecal indicator organisms the microbial challenge remains significant as water borne disease outbreaks associated with drinking water distribution systems dwds still have significant public health implications and these may not always correlate with traditional water quality metrics fricker and eldred 2009 jalava et al 2014 leclerc et al 2001 payment and locas 2011 saxena et al 2015 for example in 1998 an outbreak of campylobacteriosis in northern finland was not detected by routine water quality samples contamination occurred during a routine repair to a mains pipe leading to acute gastroenteritis in over 200 people kuusi et al 2005 to prevent outbreaks like these improved methods of detection in distribution and treatment of drinking water are required water treatment has traditionally been a 3 stage process coagulation of colloidal material using a metallic salt subsequent filtration through rapid gravity sand filters and disinfection using a chlorine based biocide this remains the most common method of treatment in many countries there are several other treatment strategies that are now used which satisfy drinking water regulations including slow sand filtration biological filtration ozonation and membrane filtration filtration and disinfection are the primary barriers to the presence of harmful pathogens in drinking water water quality regulations on the microbial safety of dwds focus on the likelihood of faecal contamination using the presence of coliform bacteria as a surrogate for the wide range of pathogens potentially present in faeces these are measured using culture based tests that isolate and enumerate coliforms and e coli specifically these methods have been broadly unchanged for over 100 years compliance with these metrics is high in the uk 99 9 dwi 2020 although isolated sporadic and low level total coliform detections remain a problem for utilities often without an attributable cause these indicators are now known to be problematic for several reasons more than 99 of bacteria are unculturable hahn et al 2019 rappé and giovannoni 2003 there are also emerging non faecal pathogens in drinking water e g mycobacterium and legionella species and the correlation between total coliforms and other pathogenic indicators is poor cabral 2010 payment and locas 2011 savichtcheva and okabe 2006 moreover routine culture tests assess a small volume 100 ml and a confirmed result takes over two days meaning that poor quality water will have already passed into the dwds well before a result is returned quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr methods are capable of identification of target organisms within a few hours but are limited in the amount of information they give about the overall microbiome there is therefore a need for additional high throughput methods of microbial characterisation to assess the diversity of microbial communities across space and time these approaches will need to move beyond the limitations of day to day testing for specific pathogenic microbes while assessing changes in the microbiome at a macro level over a long term period to manage dwds proactively 16s rrna amplicon sequencing technology can be used to characterise and identify microbial communities in dwds across space and time while the taxonomic resolution that can be achieved depends on the 16s rrna hypervariable region sequenced and the type and abundance of the taxa detected fox and reid bayliss 2014 the approach has been widely applied in academia since circa 2010 to explore microbial communities of drinking water to both assess diversity and identify groups of microbes of concern to public health this method has broad advantages over qpcr in the large amount of taxonomic information that it provides although it is non quantitative and unable to determine cell viability most 16s rrna studies are discrete across a single or few dwds within a geographical area they also tend to focus on one part of a system e g source waters efficacy of treatment processes variations of biofilm communities in space time or operating conditions within a pipe distribution network

wan et al 2019 wang et al 2014 2013 wolf baca and piekarska 2020 wu et al 2014 zhu et al 2019 while several of these studies have provided new insight into drinking water microbiomes they tend to be descriptive and not predictive add to this variability in the methods used to construct amplicon libraries e g dna extraction 16s rrna hypervariable region and sequencing platform and the complex system specific nature of dwds and it becomes difficult to build a general understanding of how drinking water microbial communities change from source to tap 16s rrna studies have shown the treatment of drinking water in general reduces the abundance and diversity of micro organisms present yet a diverse microbiome remains in potable water including genera containing pathogenic species the drinking water microbiome at customer taps may be influenced by a range of factors including source water treatment flow conditions and dwds biofilms water treatment has been proposed to have a deterministic effect selecting microbes that survive filtration and disinfection processes pinto et al 2012 lin et al 2014 this effect is likely to reduce with distance and time from treatment where biofilm growth and disturbance become more prominent at this point stochastic random effects may be more likely to govern the assembly of microbial communities due to the complexity of the local environments the importance of stochastic factors like birth death and immigration are known to be important in shaping many prokaryotic communities sloan et al 2006 thus drinking water microbiomes are dynamic through treatment time and location to aid water utilities to deliver safe potable water a deeper understanding of these changes consequences and impact on both the microbiome and the prevalence of pathogens is needed 1 1 aims and objectives here we present a meta analysis of 16s rrna studies from source to tap to explore global distribution and commonalities in the drinking water microbiomes we further consider the contribution and potential of 16s rrna amplicon sequencing as an analytical tool for water utilities research has suggested that 16s rrna amplicon sequencing is beneficial in assessing risk to public health in dwds although there are many areas for further investigation to understand the implications of the results vierheilig et al 2015 the specific aims of this meta analysis were to identify commonalities in dwds microbiomes across the world which can be used to further understanding of water quality for utilities to understand the relative importance of the deterministic effects of source and treatment on the microbiomes of dwds and explore key relationships between phyla present 2 methods 2 1 data gathering a search for all papers since 2010 using the following terms 16s rrna and water was carried out using scopus this search returned 176 results each result was individually assessed to ascertain its relevance to this meta analysis only studies using illumina miseq or hiseq platforms were included to minimise the different errors and biases associated with alternative sequencing platforms such as nanopore ion torrent or older technologies used before 2010 such as pyrosequencing d amore et al 2016 schirmer et al 2015 after this manual filter 44 studies remained and were checked to ascertain sequence data availability 26 studies had publicly available raw sequence data for the remainder data was requested only one study responded a list of the papers used in the analysis can be found in the supplementary information table s1 including relevant study and sample information all raw data downloads used the sra toolkit provided by ncbi except for one study from qiita metadata for samples from ncbi s run selector included sequencing platform the hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene sequenced sample i d sample date and time and geolocation other relevant metadata was recorded from the published research sample location disinfection type if applicable and whether the sample was from bulk water or biofilm before processing studies were grouped by the hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene sequenced in total 27 studies with 1750 samples from over 50 different dwds were compared an overview of data processing steps can be seen in figure 1 2 2 sequence processing qiime2 processed collated amplicon sequences for each platform and hypervariable v region in earth microbiome project paired end sequencing format fastq and was used to generate amplicon sequencing variants asvs qiime2 improves qiime1 in terms of quality control of sequences using dada2 and deblur software both of which were employed here to provide enough overlap of forward and reverse reads to facilitate paired end reads dada2 was employed where amplicons were 250bp long and the quality score was 20 for amplicons spanning multiple v regions deblur commands allowed for the pairing of longer amplicons without significant loss of sequence length as an explicit threshold is not required output alpha diversity profiles may be significantly different when using different denoising software to generate asvs nearing et al 2018 so runs of deblur and dada2 were carried out for all regions and platforms and compared the final analyses generated 3 32 108 demultiplexed reads in total from 2098 samples to identify the best taxonomic assignment abundance tables and phylogenetic tree files from qiime2 had taxonomy assigned using three approaches these were naïve bayesian classification system nbc bayesian least common ancestor blca approach using silva138 database and the taxass database taxass uses silva to generate a first pass of taxonomic assignment then a curated database of freshwater sequences to assign the remainder of asvs blca and silva138 were selected for downstream statistical processing as this method provided the highest level of taxonomic recovery to the genus level table s2 finally asvs from all v regions were collated together in a single abundance table asvs without sequence level resolution were removed so that full length 16s rrna sequences could be obtained for all sequences as per the method used by keating et al keating et al 2020 of the 1 27 108 sequences originally classified by silva138 from the individual datasets 1 08 108 were classified to sequence level that is 84 89 of these sequences 22574 were unique taxa generation of the final phylogenetic tree and abundance table with taxonomy was again processed in qiime2 the collation methodology applied in this meta analysis is limited in that only full length sequences already present in the silva database are included this may lead to bias towards these sequences in total from our data base 15 11 of sequences were not present in silva with sequence level resolution however without the collation strategy 16s rrna amplicon sequencing datasets of different hypervariable regions cannot be pooled and compared despite the loss of these sequences the overall beta diversity patterns present in the uncollated and collated datasets were largely preserved as shown by mantel and procrustes analyses supportinginformation figs s1 s12 only one region platform correlated poorly miseq and v3 due to differences in the abundances of 2 uncultured sequences between the datasets where the rest of the 25 most abundant taxa were identical this means that the between sample diversity patterns for collated and uncollated samples were highly similar indicating that the removed sequences were in low abundance and unlikely to disproportionally affect the results 2 3 statistical analyses the collated abundance table with taxonomy phylogenetic tree and metadata was then processed using the microbiome seq packages r meta sample groupings defined the sample location in the treatment and distribution process and if the sample originated from biofilm or bulk water samples from sediments and wastewater streams were removed at this stage giving a final sample number of 1750 shannon and richness indexes were calculated for each meta grouping to estimate alpha diversity diversity within a sample core microbiome analysis of the collated datasets was carried out in the bioconductor package using an absolute detection method and a minimum prevalence of 85 for all groups except dwds and untreated water groups these groups had significantly more samples and required a higher threshold of 95 lahti et al 2017 beta diversity or between sample diversity metrics were more complicated to assess given the substantial number of samples in the final analysis n 1750 their varying environments as well as spatial and temporal locations instead calculation of local contribution to beta diversity lcbd for each group was made legendre and de cáceres 2013 the nearest taxon index nti and net relatedness index nri from the picante package in r http kembellab ca r workshop biodivr sk biodiversity r html were used to quantify environmental filtering on community assembly to estimate the relative impacts of ecological determinism and stochasticity on the assembly of the curated microbiomes a null modelling approach was adopted using a general framework defined by ning et al 2019 using simulated bacterial communities and further applied to real communities nikolova et al 2021 ning et al 2019 trego et al 2021 normalised and modified stochasticity ratios nst and mst were calculated for all groups within the dataset in this approach deterministic processes are expected to drive species more similar or dissimilar than the null expectation nst values are quantified from the difference between the expected similarity and dissimilarity and the actual values higher nst mst above 0 5 values indicate more deterministic factors influencing community assembly lower values below 0 5 indicate more stochastic influences patterns in beta diversity may not be continual as multiple relationships may affect an organism at a specific time or place therefore a new methodology was employed using boolean patterns to assess relationships between individual asvs in all meta sample groups golovko et al 2020 this uses a pattern specific method to identify relationships between 2 asvs at a defined threshold including one way relationships co occurrence and co exclusion this method can also quantify 3 dimensional relationships between asvs these are categorised as all alone type 1 co exclusion exclusion of asv1 by asv2 and 3 type 2 co exclusion presence of asv2 and asv3 if asv1 is present and finally all three together this method was applied to the asvs in the dataset to identify any significant relationships at a phyla level 3 results 3 1 taxonomic profile sequence level classification was resolved for a total of 22754 asvs the 25 most abundant genera are shown in figure 2 in the final analysis 111 samples were from dwds bulk water the largest meta sample group bulk water from different dwds as expected was variable with differences in the abundances of the top 25 genera however there does appear to be some commonalities in taxa among dwds with the same disinfectant residual nitrosomonas and pseudomonas were more abundant in systems using a chloraminated residual pathogenic microbes such as mycobacterium were common in both chlorinated and chloraminated dwds biofilm samples in distribution were less numerous n 159 and had a much higher taxonomic diversity than the bulk water pseudomonas was common in many samples in both chlorinated and chloraminated biofilms but less so in those with no disinfectant residual samples from water sources and treatment systems made up a much smaller proportion of the dataset and differed from dwds in terms of the most abundant taxa again the most common genera in dwds were less abundant in source and treatment except nitrospira which was more abundant throughout treatment than in dwds a member of burkholderiales limnohabitans was also present throughout treatment and highly abundant in one bulk water dwds study source untreated water samples were generally from surface waters although a small proportion came from groundwater several untreated water samples show similar taxonomic profiles to each other globally all untreated water samples were highly diverse in comparison to treated water 3 2 alpha diversity core microbiome analysis of collated datasets the amount of diversity within each sample or alpha diversity can be seen in fig 3 c across the different sample groups the within sample richness values were significantly different the highest degree of sequence diversity in terms of richness and shannon index values came from untreated water a reduction in these values was evident in the treatment and dwds groups in biofilm and bulk water biofilm samples have elevated shannon values compared to bulk water although richness was similar core microbiome analysis of this collated dataset figure 3 a b proposed several prevalent taxa within more than one sample group although the overall taxa prevalence was reduced in distribution samples pseudomonas was the most commonly abundant taxa and was present at all stages of water treatment and in dwds biofilm nitrospira was prevalent within water treatment works bulk water and biofilm legionella was abundant in bulk water only in untreated and in treatment samples the only taxa prevalent throughout all bulk water and biofilm groups was an uncultured rubinisphaeraceae 3 3 local contribution to beta diversity and environmental filtering due to the unequal data classes and high degrees of spatial and temporal variation estimates of beta diversity used local contribution to beta diversity lcbd for all meta sample groups fig 4 rather than a direct measure lcbd values were only above the significance threshold for two categories when calculated using unifrac distance untreated water and distribution biofilm for bray curtis all groups had greater than the calculated threshold lcbd 0 00057 except distribution water with dwds biofilm and treated water samples having the highest values the untreated and water treatment works groups were very close to the significance threshold unifrac shows a pattern of reducing lcbd in bulk water throughout treatment and distribution whereas biofilm groups increase again in dwds samples bray curtis measures show a pattern of increasing lcbd in bulk water samples from untreated to treated water which then reduces in dwds lcbd in biofilm samples increased throughout treatment to a maximum in dwds nti and nri values for the meta sample groups were similar except for untreated water which was the only category with values 0 indicating the taxa present are more dissimilar than in the other categories biofilm in dwds had a higher nti than that of bulk water indicating that species relatedness is higher in biofilm 3 4 null modelling the nst and mst displayed in fig 5 quantify the relative importance of stochasticity for each meta sample group phylogenetic distances were calculated using jaccard with and without abundances ruzicka approach both measures produced comparable results nst values of 0 5 are more stochastic than deterministic the highest nst values were in dwds bulk water 0 71 followed closely by dwds biofilm samples 0 59 bulk water samples before and throughout treatment up to disinfection were also more stochastic than deterministic 0 53 and 0 58 only two of the groups had more deterministic values treated water 0 46 and biofilm in the water treatment works which had the most deterministic value 0 43 mst values modified ratio are much lower showing a similar pattern of values except with untreated water which has the highest most stochastic value 0 38 3 5 boolean relationships the results of the boolean analysis to identify individual relationships between asvs in the dataset at 2 and 3 dimensional levels are displayed in fig 6 the analysis identified 257 relationships between individual phyla across all stages of the treatment and distribution process many of which were present across several groups most of the relationships found were one way although there were 21 three dimensional relationships across all groups these were predominantly found in untreated water treatment and treated water groups treated water and bulk in water in dwds had the least number of relationships 11 and 17 respectively and no three dimensional relationships were found in the dwds group untreated water had 5 type 2 co exclusionary relationships detected if asv1 then asv2 and 3 are absent desulfobacterota was involved in 3 of these types of relationships with bdellovibrionata and cyanobacteria cyanobacteria were also involved in several co exclusionary relationships across the dataset and part of the only type 2 co exclusionary relationship detected within the dwds biofilm group with desulfobacterota and patescibacteriota many of cyanobacteria s relationships were maintained across the groups with both one way and co exclusion being most common with one exception cyanobacteria were found to be in a co presence relationship with bacteroidetes and planctomycetes in treated water one of only 13 relationships detected for this group 4 discussion 4 1 principles governing microbiomes in dwds taxonomic profiles of the various meta sample groups identified significant differences in abundances of genera throughout the source treatment and distribution of water there were high degrees of species richness and alpha diversity of taxa in source waters that then reduced throughout treatment processes this reduction is consistent with both the individual studies included in this analysis and several other pyrosequencing studies bautista de los santos et al 2016 pinto et al 2014 potgieter and pinto 2019 the reduction in lcbd in bulk water from untreated to treated water samples using unifrac supports the reduction in alpha diversity and richness a wide scale study of 49 dwds in china suggested reduced diversity and richness in tap compared to source waters han et al 2020 the similarity of taxa increases throughout treatment and distribution sample groups indicative of selective processes driven by filtration and chlorination which only some organisms can survive hou et al 2018 lautenschlager et al 2014 vignola et al 2018 wan et al 2019 wang et al 2014 however lcbd values using bray curtis dissimilarities increased across these groups showing precisely the opposite pattern it should be noted that unifrac measures include information on phylogenetic relatedness which bray curtis does not this highlights that beta diversity patterns throughout water treatment are incredibly complex and should be interpreted using several metrics modelling of microbiomes now concentrates on the relative importance of random events on assembly such as births deaths and environmental disturbance this is compared to more traditional view that deterministic events such as selection drive communities sloan et al 2006 as treatment and source choice may be significant in determining the organisms in the treated water this is an important measure to consider all meta sample groups except treated water and distributed biofilm had more stochastic values suggesting a greater degree of randomness in microbiome assembly in these groups however samples immediately after disinfection with chlorine treated water had a more deterministic value proteobacteria in particular pseudomonas actinobacter and rheinheimera have been demonstrated to dominate post disinfection supporting the deterministic influence of treatment becerra castro et al 2016 it also suggests that although filtration is important in defining taxa in dwds chlorine has a more strongly selective effect this is supported by a study comparing two identical treatment systems treating the same source water where chlorine and chloramine produced different bacterial communities potgieter and pinto 2019 in 2016 a meta analysis of 14 pyrosequencing studies of water distribution systems compared the bacterial communities present under different disinfectant regimes also confirming that the microbial communities in dwds without a free chlorine residual are more diverse and abundant than those containing free chlorine mycobacterium and pseudomonas were significantly reduced by the presence of a free chlorine residual in that research bautista de los santos et al 2016 in contrast this meta analysis found mycobacterium was highly abundant in dwds containing free chlorine and chloramine but less so in those containing free chlorine residuals pseudomonas was only highly abundant in biofilm samples but absent in bulk water it was more abundant in samples containing free chlorine than chloramine these differences may be due to sequencing technology sample availability and sample site characteristics and further highlight the complexity of interactions in the microbiomes of dwds these results do agree that pseudomonas and mycobacterium are important members of dwds communities in general however and should be explored further to determine how these may be minimised particularly considering their public health implications this will be explored later in the discussion bulk water in dwds had the lowest lcbd using both metrics the sharp reduction in lcbd in dwds compared with at the outlet of the treatment process treated water suggests that although treatment is important in reducing diversity time and space are important in shaping beta diversity patterns in dwds water this is consistent with several previous studies on dwds microbial communities where temporal fluctuation had a significant impact on communities mccoy and vanbriesen 2012 prest et al 2014 there may also be potential diurnal cycles in bulk water potentially due to flow patterns bautista de los santos et al 2016 many studies have also suggested that communities within dwds are unique to that system influenced by the source and treatment characteristics potgieter and pinto 2019 wu et al 2014 although the results presented here suggest that while the members of the community may be unique there is a general reduction in beta diversity from treated to dwds bulk water indicating the efficacy of these processes biofilm samples have a much higher lcbd than that of bulk water these groups are also quite different in terms of types and abundance of taxa a finding shared by individual studies douterelo et al 2019 2017 liu et al 2017b lührig et al 2015 the core microbiome analysis for both these groups had only one organism in common and the dwds samples had lower abundances this suggests that biofilm microbiomes contribute more to overall biodiversity within the pipe than the bulk water samples this is important to consider as the biofilm contains a quite different microbial profile than that of the bulk water and sampling only bulk water may give a limited picture of the overall microbiome this might lead to missed opportunities to detect pathogens as aforementioned pseudomonas was the most abundant organism within biofilm but absent in bulk water this is consistent with pseudomonas as a primary coloniser of water biofilms doǧruöz et al 2009 biofilm deposition is known to influence bulk water communities when loose deposits or biofilm are disturbed douterelo et al 2019 2017 liu et al 2017a biofilms can also significantly contribute to microbial loading in dwds with the composition affected by the presence of a chlorine residual fish and boxall 2018 these results were supported in this study by the high number of relationships evident between phyla in biofilm compared to bulk water 71 17 relationships identified this in addition to the elevated nri and nti values suggest complex interactions define the assembly of biofilm communities a null modelling approach was also adopted to assess the importance of ecological stochasticity on the assembly of the microbiomes using the nst and mst ratios ning et al 2019 assessing the relative importance of stochasticity has been applied to crude oil degrading marine bacterioplankton and anaerobic digestor communities using this approach and has been useful in understanding their assembly nikolova et al 2021 trego et al 2021 the biofilm group from water treatment works had an nst value below 0 5 indicating than deterministic effects are more prominent in these samples as they are close to null expectation although dwds biofilm had more stochastic values with higher nst values than the bulk water samples these samples are more similar or dissimilar than the null expectation the results from this dataset further supports the hypothesis that the effects of treatment and source reduce with distance and time from treatment han et al 2020 pinto et al 2014 potgieter et al 2018 the strong selective pressures exerted by treatment processes therefore may be less important in dwds the increased stochasticity in the dwds group could be due to many environmental factors including genetic drift the historical effects of treatment and source water on the assembly of the community including priority effects the material and conditions within the pipe affecting dispersal and flow conditions within the dwds this has been demonstrated by laboratory experiments using experimental pipe loops with the same influent water under different flow rates the resulting biofilms contained some shared core taxa but with differences in their relative abundances influenced by the flow conditions within each loop douterelo et al 2017 environmental impacts like priority effects drift dispersal and dispersal limitations may therefore be important factors in dwds communities these are important considerations in microbial assembly zhou and ning 2017 long term studies of discrete systems would be required to assess these impacts at various temporal scales identification of significant one two and three way relationships between individual phyla in the meta sample groups also demonstrates the complexity of dwds microbiomes 246 two dimensional relationships were detected across all sample groups the majority of these being one way there were also 21 three dimensional relationships these were particularly conserved across sample groups with desulfobacterota cyanobacteria and bdellovibrionata forming co exclusionary relationships in several groups cyanobacteria were also found to exclude bacteroidetes in biofilm dwds bacteroidetes is a phylum that contains pathogenic microbes and while there are 6 orders within this phylum consisting of over 7000 species the presence of these relationships suggests that further exploration of the abundance of these phyla is required thomas et al 2011 it would be ideal to be able to assess these boolean relationships at a lower taxonomic resolution but due to the significant increase in the number of relationships and reduced confidence values at lower levels phylum provided the best resolution for this large data set more targeted studies with a smaller sample size may be able to provide higher taxonomic resolution to explore important taxa relationships further 4 2 applying 16s rrna amplicon sequencing for water utilities as expected the 25 most abundant taxa in the combined analysis did not contain any organisms traditionally used to indicate contamination as these should be in low abundance in treated water there were no coliforms identified in the core microbiome analysis or taxa profile for any meta sample groups a few genera of enterobacteria were detected in the most abundant taxa profiles from the individual datasets before collation supporting information figs s7 s10 citrobacter kluyvera and enterobacter all members of the coliform group were detected in a small number of samples from 2 studies 20 and shigella was detected in 1 sample this further suggests that coliforms are in general in low abundance in water systems under normal operating conditions it should be noted that analysis of untreated water samples in isolation failed to identify any highly abundant enterobacteriaceae their low abundance in source waters may mean that 16s rrna amplicon sequencing is not appropriate for the detection of traditional indicator organisms these results also suggested indicators are not a part of the microbiome under normal operating conditions although whether their detection is truly indicative of contamination was not assessed coliform bacteria are considered indicators of process performance rather than faecal contamination except e coli due to their prevalence in some environments and lack of correlation to other enteric pathogens ishii et al 2006 ishii and sadowsky 2008 savichtcheva and okabe 2006 this study further suggests that their overall lack of abundance in untreated water makes them a poor indicator of process performance this analysis did reveal some organisms of concern as abundant in dwds although different organisms were of concern in different dwds consistent with the proposed system specific nature of dwds microbiomes roeselers et al 2015 of note mycobacterium was abundant in both chlorinated and chloraminated dwds but was not prevalent in non chlorinated dwds samples mycobacterium is an emerging pathogen of concern for water utilities and dominates in some dwds ashbolt 2015 zhu et al 2019 nitrosomonas and nitrospira were also highly prevalent in the biofilm of chloraminated dwds and an abundant member in several groups core microbiome analysis supporting the results of individual studies highlighting their importance chan et al 2019 shaw et al 2015 monitoring the relative abundance of organisms like nitrosomonas and nitrospira using 16s rrna amplicon sequencing may help utilities assess the risk of nitrification within chloraminated dwds nitrite is an important regulatory parameter but nitrification also indicates that disinfection levels are not sufficient to prevent microbial regrowth monitoring these groups of bacteria may help utilities intervene in dwds before these issues become significant through mains repair flushing or replacement if water utilities can optimise processes to select for non pathogenic microbes this can reduce the risk of illness from drinking water something suggested in several studies douterelo et al 2019 2017 fish and boxall 2018 an overview of microbial communities dynamics as ascertained by 16s rrna amplicon analysis provides a holistic view of the response of water treatment and dwds on microbiology this understanding will aid risk management to maintain water quality and reduce the likelihood of harmful pathogens entering the system 16s rrna studies are becoming more popular and routine for the molecular analysis of water treatment and distribution as demonstrated here they provide extensive information revealing diverse communities that are influenced by the treatment process however translating this information into practice to inform and predict water quality is not always obvious to water utilities however taking a global meta analysis view this analysis highlighted several ways in which water utilities might employ 16s rrna sequencing to improve drinking water quality considering whole microbial community dynamics from source to water bulk and biofilm this review has identified several organisms highly abundant throughout source and treatment that can be potentially used to benchmark performance and monitor risk as aforementioned pseudomonas and mycobacterium were all abundant in dwds while legionella was abundant in the source and treatment groups members of this genus are known pathogens of concern for drinking water quality in particular the higher abundance of the genus legionella in source waters and treatment in this analysis may make it a good indicator of treatment performance especially as other studies have detected legionella in treated water samples ashbolt 2015 hou et al 2018 vignola et al 2018 legionella is an emerging pathogen of concern to the water industry and in the uk may be included in future water quality regulations the legionella genus contains 71 species only a few of which are pathogenic with legionella pneumophilae being of most concern doleans et al 2004 garrity et al 2005 in this meta analysis 67 different sequences were assigned to legionella species including l pneumophilae l longbeachae and l bozemanii these species account for 96 3 of cases of legionellosis worldwide doleans et al 2004 therefore amplicon sequencing can aid water utilities to assess the risk of legionellosis from water systems although the viability of the organisms detected must also be considered using an alternative method flow cytometry fcm may provide the appropriate information to compliment 16s rrna sequencing using fcm with the intercalating dyes sybr green and propidium iodide to stain genetic material in situ within a sample gives a quantitative measure of the intact cells within the microbiome of dwds this is due to the ability of sybr green to permeate intact cell membranes whereas propidium iodide cannot dead cells therefore appear red where intact cells fluoresce green allowing each to be distinguished this approach has been extensively explored in studies assessing water treatment cell removal dwds regrowth and seasonal changes within microbiomes besmer and hammes 2016 hammes et al 2010 hassard et al 2019 prest et al 2016 fcm can also provide more information than just the count of cells within a sample using the relative fluorescence and a statistical binning process cells can be grouped into populations which can then be tracked favere et al 2020 props et al 2016 a quantitative measure like the ratio of intact cells to the total count of cells within a sample could be used by utilities to quantify the viability of the organisms identified using a 16s rrna amplicon sequencing enhancing the benefits of both analyses measures of species richness and abundance such as alpha diversity and lcbd at treatment and distribution stages are useful to water utilities when comparing dwds performance although monitoring the relative abundance of specific taxa in a single dwds may not be able to detect a risk to public health directly an understanding of these values across different dwds allow water utilities to assess the impacts of source treatment and distribution conditions on water quality and make more informed choices on asset investment understanding the relative impacts of ecological stochasticity in dwds microbiomes is also a useful exercise for water utilities higher stochastic values in bulk water and biofilm of dwds samples in this analysis suggest that random events are more important than treatment processes or other prior deterministic events in determining the bacterial communities in contrast biofilm communities in the water treatment works and bulk treated water groups are more deterministic affected by the prior treatment processes and presence of a high chlorine residual managing biofilm and ensuring treatment processes remove microbes of concern is where water utilities can most effectively minimise risk to public health this discussion has focussed primarily on the results from dwds as this provided the largest proportion of the available data there is a need to sample further at source and throughout treatment processes to explore the ecological rules and relationships between taxa at these stages and their subsequent impact on assembly of microbiomes in the dwds this is a particularly important question for water utilities so that they can improve treatment and distribution processes 5 conclusions there are copious quantities of data from amplicon sequencing studies in dwds although many of these studies provide only a descriptive understanding of the microbiomes as a result this information has yet to be used to predict and direct microbial water quality there has been a reluctance to adopt sequencing technology among water utilities as the benefits are not immediately clear using a meta analysis of 16s rrna amplicons we have shown that while treatment and distribution of water significantly reduce the diversity and abundance of taxa present in the source the subsequent assembly of microbiomes in drinking water is a stochastic process particularly in the dwds this suggests that the effects of source and treatment diminish with distance and time in bulk water only the assembly of microbiomes at the point of chlorination is more deterministic due to selection pressures on organisms that cannot survive oxidation although 16s rrna amplicon sequencing cannot satisfy current water quality regulation it can assess the risk from emerging pathogens such as legionella or mycobacterium or biofilm colonisers like pseudomonas which may be in high abundance in dwds amplicon sequencing can also track significant changes in the microbiome associated with contamination or changes in process performance these are benefits traditional culture tests cannot provide however further work is required to standardise sequencing and data analysis methods for 16s rrna amplicon sequencing methods to enable the water industry to adopt them as standard practice declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements

16261,the demand for natural gas has led to the development of techniques used to access unconventional oil and natural gas uog resources due to the novelty of uog the potential impacts to freshwater ecosystems are not fully understood we used a dual pronged approach to study the effects of uog development on microbial biodiversity and function via a laboratory microcosm experiment and a survey study of streams with and without uog development within their watersheds the microcosm experiment simulated stream contamination with produced water a byproduct of uog operations using sediment collected from one high water quality stream and two low water quality streams for the survey study biofilm and sediment samples were collected from streams experiencing varying levels of uog development in the microcosm experiment produced water decreased microbial aerobic and anaerobic co2 production in the high water quality stream sediment but had a positive effect on this microbial activity in the lower water quality stream sediments suggesting habitat degradation alters the response of microbes to contaminants results from the stream survey indicate uog development alters stream water temperature chemistry sediment aerobic and anaerobic co2 production and microbial community biodiversity in both sediments and biofilms correlations among uog associated land use environmental and microbial variables suggest increases in light availability and sediment delivery to streams due to deforestation and land disturbance impact stream microbial communities and their

eukaryotic biofilms the relative abundances of two ochrophyta families containing nitzschia and amphora were 2 7 fold higher in impacted streams fig s3 indval p 0 01 4 discussion development associated with uog requires land alteration to construct access roads well pads gathering lines and pipelines these land alterations which reduce forest coverage could impact streams by altering light availability or changing sediment delivery likewise leaks or spills of produced water during uog extraction activities could contaminate streams with organic compounds and salts vengosh et al 2014 potentially impacting biological systems we conducted a microcosm study exposing sediments to produced water and a survey study to assess the effects of uog development on stream microbial community composition and function we sought to compare microcosm study findings to survey study data in order to explore the possibility that the observed differences between impact groups in the survey study may be attributed to produced water entering streams 4 1 microcosm experiment the addition of produced water to sediment microcosms yielded effects on microbial metabolic activity that were dependent on site fig 1 increased activity in lower water quality streams suggests microbial communities in these streams wh and te may be able to utilize organic compounds present in produced water such as toluene benzene and other hydrocarbons orem et al 2017 potentially due to previous exposure alternatively the increases in activity in lower water quality streams may also be attributed to the release of dissolved organic carbon doc from sediment facilitated by salts in produced water reemtsma et al 1999 microorganisms in the lower water quality streams may be salt tolerant due to relatively high concentrations of dissolved ions in these streams in contrast microbial activity in the higher water quality stream was reduced by produced water potentially due microbial inhibition resulting from high salt concentration hanson et al 2019 mclaughlin et al 2016 while produced water did not significantly change overall prokaryotic community composition several families were responsive to the treatments and identified as significant indicator taxa fig 2 the indicator taxa that increased in relative abundance with produced water such as asvs in sphingomonadaceae and methylomirabilaceae may be benefitting from compounds present in produced water for example some members of the family sphingomonadaceae are known to degrade hydrocarbon compounds including those present in produced water vengosh et al 2014 similarly members of methylomirabilaceae are anaerobic methane oxidizers versantvoot et al 2018 and may have consumed methane present in produced water most of the indicator taxa differed between the anaerobic and aerobic conditions suggesting produced water has distinct effects under these conditions fig 2 however sphingomonadaceae responded positively and gemmatimonadaceae responded negatively to produced water regardless of oxygen availability suggesting it may be appropriate to use these families as bioindicators of produced water contamination in streams indeed members of sphingomonadaceae have been detected in produced water santillan et al 2015 4 2 survey study no evidence of stream contamination with produced water the survey of stream responses to watershed uog development revealed no evidence of stream contamination with produced water first stream water chemistry in impacted and highly impacted streams table 1 was not consistent with the composition of produced water which has elevated levels of barium and strontium vengosh et al 2014 secondly there was no overlap in indicator taxa between the microcosm experiment and survey study fig 2 and fig 6 similarly genera commonly found in produced water such as halanerobium and marinobacterium cluff et al 2014 and lipus et al 2017 were not detected in our streams and hydrocarbon degraders and methane consumers previously suggested as uog bioindicators in stream sediments were also absent chen see et al 2018 third while impacts of uog development were observed correlations between microbial and environmental variables suggest these changes are likely due to other mechanisms of uog impact discussed below lack of evidence for stream contamination with produced water is consistent with a similar observational study in north central pa mumford et al 2020 and suggests the efforts to manage produced water on site during uog development including on site containment blowout preventers and waste transportation plans ziemkiewicz et al 2014 may be effectively preventing spills and leaks into headwater streams however our sampling effort may have been insufficient to detect rare or sporadic contamination events produced water spills due to equipment leaks occur more frequently than any other failure scenarios during uog development and despite regulatory efforts illegal dumping of produced water has been reported abualfaraj et al 2018 4 3 survey study stream water properties and biofilm assemblages taken together our stream survey results suggest that uog impacts on stream physicochemical properties and biotic communities derived mostly from deforestation and land disturbance this agrees with the findings of mauter et al 2014 who concluded that the removal of vegetation for uog development is the primary risk to surface water quality deforestation raises the water table and depletes chloride stocks in groundwater giménez et al 2016 because groundwater chloride concentrations are closely linked to that of stream water bernal et al 2015 the lower chloride levels in highly impacted sites table 1 is likely a consequence of deforestation in these watersheds similar reductions in stream chloride concentrations were observed in watersheds with high levels of uog development in north central pa mumford et al 2020 stream water temperature was significantly elevated in highly impacted sites table 1 and previous research suggests that streams located in deforested watersheds experience greater mean temperatures compared to those in forested watersheds ilha et al 2018 this is most likely due to decreased riparian forest cover which increases light availability to streams because many organisms within biofilm matrices are phototrophic assemblage structure is partially controlled by light battin et al 2016 indeed highly impacted streams had a greater proportion of cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae in stream biofilms fig 5 these trends suggest greater light availability in streams with watershed uog activity and agree with previous research suggesting that increased light availability is followed by a decrease in prokaryotic biofilm heterotrophic bacteria bengtsson et al 2018 more light availability to streams and increased relative abundance of phototrophs fig 5 in uog impacted streams may be accompanied by a shift from allochthonous to autochthonous organic substrates heterotrophic bacteria present in biofilms preferentially process labile autochthonous carbon made available by increased algal exudation under increased light availability in lieu of recalcitrant allochthonous carbon from terrestrial sources wagner et al 2017 potentially altering biofilm bacterial community composition this could contribute to the shift in biofilm prokaryotic community composition that we observed in the highly impacted streams fig 4d changes in the production availability and decomposition of autochthonous and allochthonous carbon may alter carbon transfer from heterotrophic bacteria to higher trophic levels wagner et al 2017 in streams experiencing reduced canopy cover leaf litter inputs will decline potentially reducing the abundance of associated macroinvertebrates such as shredders wallace and eggert 2009 however biofilm consuming macroinvertebrates can increase in abundance as biofilms become more productive hawkins et al 1982 taken together our results suggest that deforestation in uog impacted watersheds may increase light availability enhancing the proportion of biofilm phototrophs which could augment autochthonous carbon inputs and alter the stream food web area of pipeline was correlated with changes in sediment texture in streams fig s2 specifically pipeline area was positively correlated with silt and clay and negatively correlated with sand content while not statistically significant impacted and highly impacted streams generally displayed higher amounts of silt and clay whereas the non impacted reference streams typically had higher amounts of sand table 1 these trends are likely due to erosion and fine sediment transport following land disturbance associated with uog development within watersheds finer sediments are likely being delivered to impacted and highly impacted streams located in deforested watersheds as runoff transports silt and clay greater distances than sand meyer et al 1995 clay can decrease water movement within biofilm matrices creating anaerobic environments and impacting biofilm biodiversity this may explain why anaerolineaceae an anaerobic bacterium mcllroy et al 2017 was an indicator of impact and more abundant in uog developed groups fig 6 4 4 survey study stream sediment physiochemical properties microbial function and community composition sediment texture also displayed correlations with sediment microbial activity both aerobic and anaerobic co2 production were positively correlated with silt content fig s2 these correlations agree with previous studies that demonstrated higher microbial respiration rates in finer textured soils compared to sandy soils hamarashid et al 2010 changes in silt content could underlie the augmented co2 production in the impacted streams sediments fig 3 since they also had the greatest average silt content table 1 fine textured sediments often have higher organic matter concentrations christensen and sørensen 1985 which may explain the higher respiration rates observed in the impacted sites alternatively enhanced respiration rates in the impacted and highly impacted streams could be a consequence of environmental stress microbes exhibit increased respiration per unit biomass metabolic quotient in disturbed environments anderson and domsch 1993 presumably due to greater energy expenditure toward maintenance rather than growth ely et al 2010 both enhanced microbial activity and reduced diffusion with fine sediments can lower oxygen levels in the hyporheic zone nogaro et al 2010 potentially impacting higher trophic levels for example by reducing the survival of fish eggs wood and armitage 1997 sediment community composition differed by impact status highly impacted streams had greater within group β diversity fig 4h indicating more variable community composition a few impacted and highly impacted streams were very different from non impacted streams exhibiting a negative shift on pcoa axis 1 fig 4g in these streams landscape attributes such as slope and hydrology may be determining sediment and nutrient delivery sheridan and noske 2007 and augmenting the impact of uog development along the same lines uog development may have a disproportionate impact on some stream segments in the local catchment due to proximity or topography entrekin et al 2015 since we only sampled a small stream reach within each catchment at a single time point our sampling effort may have been insufficient to consistently detect the impacts of uog perhaps due to spatially or temporally heterogeneous disturbances caused by well activity this may explain why some communities in impacted and highly impacted streams did not display differences from non impacted streams while others were very distinct 4 5 future directions impacted streams generally had poorer water quality elevated ec tds and alkalinity and calcium table 1 and increased respiration fig 3 development in impacted watersheds may be contributing to the observed changes in water chemistry and respiration via elevated organic matter delivery associated with fine textured sediments future research could focus on streams whose watersheds are predominantly impacted by uog pipeline uog wells or land use classified as oil and gas barren to fully understand which observed impacts may be attributed to specific types of uog development further investigation of watershed attributes in relation to uog development may reveal if specific watershed features such as slope exacerbate the impact of uog development on streams as suggested by previous studies entrekin et al 2015 4 6 microorganisms as indicators of uog related disturbances the sensitivity of microorganisms to environmental conditions along with the ease and affordability of modern sequencing has led to burgeoning interest in the use of microorganisms as indicators of water quality tan et al 2015 we observed a decline in the relative abundance of many bacterial families in response to both uog impact levels fig 6 this suggests that microorganisms are sensitive to the environmental changes related to uog development and may serve as effective bioindicators of ecosystem effects associated with these operations flavobacteriaceae and acidimicrobiia asvs in sediment and prokaryotic biofilm samples respectively had particularly strong responses to uog development fig 6 this suggests they may be useful indicators of uog associated impacts which is supported by previous studies ulrich et al 2018 5 conclusion taken together our results suggest the impacts of uog development on headwater streams are not from produced water but likely derive from the land disturbance and deforestation associated with uog development shifts in sediment texture were associated with altered biofilm community composition and sediment community function deforestation associated with constructing uog infrastructure potentially allows more light to reach streams and increases the proportion of cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae within stream biofilms potentially augmenting autochthonous production the observed changes in sediment respiration and biofilm biodiversity may alter carbon transfer to higher trophic levels thereby changing broader ecosystem function efforts to maintain or restore riparian vegetation and prevent soil erosion may reduce the impacts of uog development on streams funding this work was supported by the national science foundation award number 1

16261,the demand for natural gas has led to the development of techniques used to access unconventional oil and natural gas uog resources due to the novelty of uog the potential impacts to freshwater ecosystems are not fully understood we used a dual pronged approach to study the effects of uog development on microbial biodiversity and function via a laboratory microcosm experiment and a survey study of streams with and without uog development within their watersheds the microcosm experiment simulated stream contamination with produced water a byproduct of uog operations using sediment collected from one high water quality stream and two low water quality streams for the survey study biofilm and sediment samples were collected from streams experiencing varying levels of uog development in the microcosm experiment produced water decreased microbial aerobic and anaerobic co2 production in the high water quality stream sediment but had a positive effect on this microbial activity in the lower water quality stream sediments suggesting habitat degradation alters the response of microbes to contaminants results from the stream survey indicate uog development alters stream water temperature chemistry sediment aerobic and anaerobic co2 production and microbial community biodiversity in both sediments and biofilms correlations among uog associated land use environmental and microbial variables suggest increases in light availability and sediment delivery to streams due to deforestation and land disturbance impact stream microbial communities and their function consistent changes in the relative abundance of bacterial taxa suggest microorganisms may be good indicators of the environmental changes associated with uog development the observed impacts

fahrenfeld et al 2017 mumford et al 2020 it is predicted that production from uog resources in the united states will double by 2035 and the practice will continue to spread globally vengosh et al 2014 the aim of this study was to determine if and how uog development impacts stream health by examining microbial community composition and function in concert with stream and sediment physiochemical properties we hypothesized that highly impacted streams with above average levels of uog development would have altered biodiversity and impaired function due to changes in stream and or sediment physiochemical properties associated with uog development to accomplish our aim we used a dual pronged approach consisting of a laboratory microcosm experiment fig s1 to test the effects of produced water on sediment communities and a survey of streams experiencing varying levels of watershed uog development 2 methods 2 1 survey study site selection and sampling forested headwater

associated with uog requires land alteration to construct access roads well pads gathering lines and pipelines these land alterations which reduce forest coverage could impact streams by altering light availability or changing sediment delivery likewise leaks or spills of produced water during uog extraction activities could contaminate streams with organic compounds and salts vengosh et al 2014 potentially impacting biological systems we conducted a microcosm study exposing sediments to produced water and a survey study to assess the effects of uog development on stream microbial community composition and function we sought to compare microcosm study findings to survey study data in order to explore the possibility that the observed differences between impact groups in the survey study may be attributed to produced water entering streams 4 1 microcosm experiment the addition of produced water to sediment microcosms yielded effects on microbial metabolic activity that were dependent on site fig 1 increased activity in lower water quality streams suggests microbial communities in these streams wh and te may be able to utilize organic compounds present in produced water such as toluene benzene and other hydrocarbons orem et al 2017 potentially due to previous exposure alternatively the increases in activity in lower water quality streams may also be attributed to the release of dissolved organic carbon doc from sediment facilitated by salts in produced water reemtsma et al 1999 microorganisms in the lower water quality streams may be salt tolerant due to relatively high concentrations of dissolved ions in these streams in contrast microbial activity in the higher water quality stream was reduced by produced water potentially due microbial inhibition resulting from high salt concentration hanson et al 2019 mclaughlin et al 2016 while produced water did not significantly change overall prokaryotic community composition several families were responsive to the treatments and identified as significant indicator taxa fig 2 the indicator taxa that increased in relative abundance with produced water such as asvs in sphingomonadaceae and methylomirabilaceae may be benefitting from compounds present in produced water for example some members of the family sphingomonadaceae are known to degrade hydrocarbon compounds including those present in produced water vengosh et al 2014 similarly members of methylomirabilaceae are anaerobic methane oxidizers versantvoot et al 2018 and may have consumed methane present in produced water most of the indicator taxa differed between the anaerobic and aerobic conditions suggesting produced water has distinct effects under these conditions fig 2 however sphingomonadaceae responded positively and gemmatimonadaceae responded negatively to produced water regardless of oxygen availability suggesting it may be appropriate to use these families as bioindicators of produced water contamination in streams indeed members of sphingomonadaceae have been detected in produced water santillan et al 2015 4 2 survey study no evidence of stream contamination with produced water the survey of stream responses to watershed uog development revealed no evidence of stream contamination with produced water first stream water chemistry in impacted and highly impacted streams table 1 was not consistent with the composition of produced water which has elevated levels of barium and strontium vengosh et al 2014 secondly there was no overlap in indicator taxa between the microcosm experiment and survey study fig 2 and fig 6 similarly genera commonly found in produced water such as halanerobium and marinobacterium cluff et al 2014 and lipus et al 2017 were not detected in our streams and hydrocarbon degraders and methane consumers previously suggested as uog bioindicators in stream sediments were also absent chen see et al 2018 third while impacts of uog development were observed correlations between microbial and environmental variables suggest these changes are likely due to other mechanisms of uog impact discussed below lack of evidence for stream contamination with produced water is consistent with a similar observational study in north central pa mumford et al 2020 and suggests the efforts to manage produced water on site during uog development including on site containment blowout preventers and waste transportation plans ziemkiewicz et al 2014 may be effectively preventing spills and leaks into headwater streams however our sampling effort may have been insufficient to detect rare or sporadic contamination events produced water spills due to equipment leaks occur more frequently than any other failure scenarios during uog development and despite regulatory efforts illegal dumping of produced water has been reported abualfaraj et al 2018 4 3 survey study stream water properties and biofilm assemblages taken together our stream survey results suggest that uog impacts on stream physicochemical properties and biotic communities derived mostly from deforestation and land disturbance this agrees with the findings of mauter et al 2014 who concluded that the removal of vegetation for uog development is the primary risk to surface water quality deforestation raises the water table and depletes chloride stocks in groundwater giménez et al 2016 because groundwater chloride concentrations are closely linked to that of stream water bernal et al 2015 the lower chloride levels in highly impacted sites table 1 is likely a consequence of deforestation in these watersheds similar reductions in stream chloride concentrations were observed in watersheds with high levels of uog development in north central pa mumford et al 2020 stream water temperature was significantly elevated in highly impacted sites table 1 and previous research suggests that streams located in deforested watersheds experience greater mean temperatures compared to those in forested watersheds ilha et al 2018 this is most likely due to decreased riparian forest cover which increases light availability to streams because many organisms within biofilm matrices are phototrophic assemblage structure is partially controlled by light battin et al 2016 indeed highly impacted streams had a greater proportion of cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae in stream biofilms fig 5 these trends suggest greater light availability in streams with watershed uog activity and agree with previous research suggesting that increased light availability is followed by a decrease in prokaryotic biofilm heterotrophic bacteria bengtsson et al 2018 more light availability to streams and increased relative abundance of phototrophs fig 5 in uog impacted streams may be accompanied by a shift from allochthonous to autochthonous organic substrates heterotrophic bacteria present in biofilms preferentially process labile autochthonous carbon made available by increased algal exudation under increased light availability in lieu of recalcitrant allochthonous carbon from terrestrial sources wagner et al 2017 potentially altering biofilm bacterial community composition this could contribute to the shift in biofilm prokaryotic community composition that we observed in the highly impacted streams fig 4d changes in the production availability and decomposition of autochthonous and allochthonous carbon may alter carbon transfer from heterotrophic bacteria to higher trophic levels wagner et al 2017 in streams experiencing reduced canopy cover leaf litter inputs will decline potentially reducing the abundance of associated macroinvertebrates such as shredders wallace and eggert 2009 however biofilm consuming macroinvertebrates can increase in abundance as biofilms become more productive hawkins et al 1982 taken together our results suggest that deforestation in uog impacted watersheds may increase light availability enhancing the proportion of biofilm phototrophs which could augment autochthonous carbon inputs and alter the stream food web area of pipeline was correlated with changes in sediment texture in streams fig s2 specifically pipeline area was positively correlated with silt and clay and negatively correlated with sand content while not statistically significant impacted and highly impacted streams generally displayed higher amounts of silt and clay whereas the non impacted reference streams typically had higher amounts of sand table 1 these trends are likely due to erosion and fine sediment transport following land disturbance associated with uog development within watersheds finer sediments are likely being delivered to impacted and highly impacted streams located in deforested watersheds as runoff transports silt and clay greater distances than sand meyer et al 1995 clay can decrease water movement within biofilm matrices creating anaerobic environments and impacting biofilm biodiversity this may explain why anaerolineaceae an anaerobic bacterium mcllroy et al 2017 was an indicator of impact and more abundant in uog developed groups fig 6 4 4 survey study stream sediment physiochemical properties microbial function and community composition sediment texture also displayed correlations with sediment microbial activity both aerobic and anaerobic co2 production were positively correlated with silt content fig s2 these correlations agree with previous studies that demonstrated higher microbial respiration rates in finer textured soils compared to sandy soils hamarashid et al 2010 changes in silt content could underlie the augmented co2 production in the impacted streams sediments fig 3 since they also had the greatest average silt content table 1 fine textured sediments often have higher organic matter concentrations christensen and sørensen 1985 which may explain the higher respiration rates observed in the impacted sites alternatively enhanced respiration rates in the impacted and highly impacted streams could be a consequence of environmental stress microbes exhibit increased respiration per unit biomass metabolic quotient in disturbed environments anderson and domsch 1993 presumably due to greater energy expenditure toward maintenance rather than growth ely et al 2010 both enhanced microbial activity and reduced diffusion with fine sediments can lower oxygen levels in the hyporheic zone nogaro et al 2010 potentially impacting higher trophic levels for example by reducing the survival of fish eggs wood and armitage 1997 sediment community composition differed by impact status highly impacted streams had greater within group β diversity fig 4h indicating more variable community composition a few impacted and highly impacted streams were very different from non impacted streams exhibiting a negative shift on pcoa axis 1 fig 4g in these streams landscape attributes such as slope and hydrology may be determining sediment and nutrient delivery sheridan and noske 2007 and augmenting the impact of uog development along the same lines uog development may have a disproportionate impact on some stream segments in the local catchment due to proximity or topography entrekin et al 2015 since we only sampled a small stream reach within each catchment at a single time point our sampling effort may have been insufficient to consistently detect the impacts of uog perhaps due to spatially or temporally heterogeneous disturbances caused by well activity this may explain why some communities in impacted and highly impacted streams did not display differences from non impacted streams while others were very distinct 4 5 future directions impacted streams generally had poorer water quality elevated ec tds and alkalinity and calcium table 1 and increased respiration fig 3 development in impacted watersheds may be contributing to the observed changes in water chemistry and respiration via elevated organic matter delivery associated with fine textured sediments future research could focus on streams whose watersheds are predominantly impacted by uog pipeline uog wells or land use classified as oil and gas barren to fully understand which observed impacts may be attributed to specific types of uog development further investigation of watershed attributes in relation to uog development may reveal if specific watershed features such as slope exacerbate the impact of uog development on streams as suggested by previous studies entrekin et al 2015 4 6 microorganisms as indicators of uog related disturbances the sensitivity of microorganisms to environmental conditions along with the ease and affordability of modern sequencing has led to burgeoning interest in the use of microorganisms as indicators of water quality tan et al 2015 we observed a decline in the relative abundance of many bacterial families in response to both uog impact levels fig 6 this suggests that microorganisms are sensitive to the environmental changes related to uog development and may serve as effective bioindicators of ecosystem effects associated with these operations flavobacteriaceae and acidimicrobiia asvs in sediment and prokaryotic biofilm samples respectively had particularly strong responses to uog development fig 6 this suggests they may be useful indicators of uog associated impacts which is supported by previous studies ulrich et al 2018 5 conclusion taken together our results suggest the impacts of uog development on headwater streams are not from produced water but likely derive from the land disturbance and deforestation associated with uog development shifts in sediment texture were associated with altered biofilm community composition and sediment community function deforestation associated with constructing uog infrastructure potentially allows more light to reach streams and increases the proportion of cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae within stream biofilms potentially augmenting autochthonous production the observed changes in sediment respiration and biofilm biodiversity may alter carbon transfer to higher trophic levels thereby changing broader ecosystem function efforts to maintain or restore riparian vegetation and prevent soil erosion may reduce the impacts of uog development on streams funding this work was supported by the national science foundation award number 1

16262,peracetic acid paa has been widely used as an alternative disinfectant in wastewater treatment and paa based advanced oxidation processes aops have drawn increasing attention recently among the generated reactive species after paa activation acetylperoxyl radical ch3co3 plays an important role in organic compounds degradation however little is known about the reaction mechanism on ch3co3 attack due to the challenging of experimental analysis in this study a homogeneous paa activation system was built up using co ii as an activator at neutral ph to generate ch3co3 for phenol degradation more importantly reaction mechanism on ch3co3 driven oxidation of phenol is elucidated at the molecular level ch3co3 with lower electrophilicity index but much larger waals molecular volume holds different phenol oxidation route compared with the conventional oh direct evidences on ch3co3 formation and attack mechanism are provided through integrated experimental and theoretical results indicating that hydrogen atom abstraction haa is the most favorable route in the initial step of ch3co3 driven phenol oxidation haa reaction step is found to produce phenoxy radicals with a low energy barrier of 4 78 kcal mol 1 and free energy change of 12 21 kcal mol 1 the generated phenoxy radicals will undergo further dimerization to form 4 phenoxyphenol and corresponding hydroxylated products or react with ch3co3 to generate catechol and hydroquinone these results significantly promote the understanding of ch3co3 driven organic pollutant degradation and are useful for further development of paa based aops in environmental applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid advanced oxidation process acetylperoxyl radical hydrogen atom

conventional oh aops have shown good efficiency for water disinfection and decontamination huber et al 2003 however the oh aops can be readily inhibited by complex water matrices such as the natural organic matter and inorganic ions matta et al 2011 in contrast paa based aops show higher sterilization efficiency lower ph dependence and easier technical implementation in inactivating pathogens and eliminating organic pollutants in water cai et al 2017 sun et al 2018 ao et al 2021 in addition the o oh bond energy of paa 38 kcal mol 1 is lower than that of h2o2 51 kcal mol 1 which also facilitates the paa activation process with lower energy bianchini et al 2002 reactive radicals including oh ch3co3 ch3co2 ch3 ch3o2 and ho2 can be produced by cleaving the peroxide bond in paa molecule via energy or electron transfer reactions ao et al 2021 among the produced radicals oh e h 0 1 8 2 72 v ch3co2 e h 0 2 24 v and ch3co3 e h 0 1 60 v have been proposed to play dominant roles in contaminants degradation while the others contribute little because of their poor oxidation capacity instability or complicated side reactions merényi et al 1994 huber et al 2003 lu and continetti 2004 kim et al 2020 to note recent literatures have reported that ch3co2 easily undergoes self decomposition k 2 3 105 s 1 and contributes much less than ch3co3 and oh radicals kim et al 2020 zhang and huang 2020 li et al 2021 in a typical paa based aop ch3co3 and or oh radicals are more likely to dominate the efficient degradation of organic contaminants cai et al 2017 chen et al 2019 ao et al 2021 li et al 2021 in typical aops e g uv h2o2 uv tio2 and o3 h2o2 oh is the most common reactive species which can rapidly and non selectively react with most organic compounds for degradation and even complete mineralization huber et al 2003 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 in paa aop systems oh can be produced through activation of coexisting h2o2 and or paa the mechanism for oh attacking organic pollutants have been well documented including 1 hydrogen atom abstraction haa pathway for the oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons 2 radical adducts formation raf pathway for alkenes and most aromatic ring papagni et al 2001 in comparison single electron transfer set mechanism is less favorable in the oh induced reaction as suggested by theoretical methods gao et al 2014 luo et al 2018 besides oh ch3co3 also plays an important role in paa aop systems however research on mechanism of ch3co3 initiated oxidation of organic compounds is very limited due to interference of coexisting radicals and extremely short life of ch3co3 it is difficult to characterize corresponding reaction intermediates resulting from ch3co3 attacking recently co ii paa process has been reported as a special paa aop system in which ch3co3 is proposed to be the dominant reactive species under neutral condition kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 liu et al 2021a this provides a great opportunity to clarify the behavior of ch3co3 without the influence of other species though several reaction routes have been guessed based on the products identification and quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 li et al 2021 underlying mechanism on the oxidation of organic compounds by ch3co3 in the paa aop system remains unanswered in addition capturing and identification of transient species in different pathways is quite an analytical challenge therefore an improved mechanistic understanding of the reaction of organic compounds with ch3co3 is desired quantum calculation methods offer an available way to investigate the behavior of radical oxidation processes especially when the experimental analysis is technically challenging for example oh mediated oxidation of ibuprofen has been studied by constructing energy profiles for different reaction routes with density functional theory dft calculation xiao et al 2014 and haa pathway is found to be the most favorable it is also proposed that triclosan can be initially attacked by oh in both raf and haa routes using the quantum chemical approach gao et al 2014 moreover previous research has studied the first step of so4 initiated degradation of 76 aromatic compounds with quantum mechanics based calculations and showed that the set pathway is an important reaction mechanism luo et al 2017 it is thus believed that quantum calculation methods can also help us to better understand the ch3co3 initiated organic compounds oxidation reactions therefore this study is conducted with the aim of elucidating the mechanisms of ch3co3 driven oxidation of organic contaminants through integrated experimental and theoretical methods co ii paa process at neutral ph was experimentally employed to produce ch3co3 as the dominant reactive species for reaction as complicated organic molecules have too many reactions sites in this study phenol a classical organic pollutant with typical structure was selected as the target organic compound first the degradation efficiency of phenol in co ii paa process was investigated and the reaction products were carefully identified then after constructing the energy profiles of three different pathways haa raf and set the mechanism of ch3co3 mediated phenol oxidation was proposed based on the detected reaction intermediates and dft calculations this study can provide deep insights into the reaction of ch3co3 with organic compounds in paa aop system and promote the application of the paa aop in real water treatment area 2 materials and methods 2 1 oxidation of phenol in co ii paa process chemicals used in this study are presented in text s1 of supplementary data the co ii paa process under neutral condition is applied to study the ch3co3 driven oxidation of phenol as ch3co3 is the major and most reactive radical for compounds degradation in this system kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 liu et al 2021a the oxidation experiments were conducted in batch reactors 100 ml amber borosilicate glass vials with constant magnetic stirring at room temperature 22 0 5 c in a typical reaction system solution in the vial contained 10 μm phenol and 0 1 mm paa the initial solution ph was adjusted to 7 0 by adding diluted naoh 0 5 m or h2so4 0 5 m solution then co ch3coo 2 solution was added as co ii source final concentration of 10 μm to initiate the reaction sample aliquots 1 ml were taken regularly into high performance liquid chromatography hplc vials in which 10 μl of 0 1 m sodium thiosulfate solution was pre injected to quench the reaction immediately for further analysis for the experiment on effect of co ii co ii concentration was varied as 2 25 μm while for effect of paa paa dosage was varied as 0 05 0 4 mm all the experiments were conducted in duplicated and control tests on phenol degradation with paa or co ii added alone were also carried out the pseudo first order model is introduced to describe the phenol degradation kinetics which is expressed as 1 k obs ln c t c 0 t where c t and c 0 are the real time and initial concentration of phenol μm respectively t is the reaction time min 2 2 analytical methods the residue concentration of

dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as the spin trapping agent on a emxplus 6 1 epr spectrometer bruker germany aqueous solutions of paa and dmpo were mixed first and then co ii was added afterwards the mixture was immediately transferred into a capillary tube and then inserted into the cavity of a bruker emxplus 6 1 epr spectrometer germany the epr spectra were recorded at 20 c on the spectrometer

the mathworks inc usa the splitting pattern for a dmpo radical adduct was derived from one n and one h fitted parameters from the best fit of the experimental adduct spectra were hyperfine coupling constants ah g an g and the ratio of amounts of each component in the adduct spectra the fitting of multicomponent experimental spectra of dmpo radical adducts by the simulations were conducted by the nelder and mead method which is incorporated in easyspin the best fit was obtained by minimizing the root mean square deviation rmsd between experimental and simulated spectra the best fit resulted in a very small residual value of rsmd of 0 126 table s1 shows the simulation results 2 3 computational methods all quantum chemical calculations were performed using the gaussian 16 program revision c

products and transition state ts species are calculated by the hybrid density functional theory at b3lyp 6 31g level becke 1993 stephens et al 1994 the b3lyp functional theory has been shown to give reliable results for radical oxidation of organic molecules gao et al 2014 xiao et al 2014 luo et al 2017 vibrational frequencies are calculated at the same level to provide the thermal and entropic contributions to the free energies and identify the nature of all stationary points as either minima zero imaginary frequency or transition state only one imaginary frequency intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations are performed to confirm that each ts connected the corresponding reactants with the products fukui 1981 single point energies are calculated for the optimized geometries with b3lyp 6 311 g including the solvent water effect modeled with the solvation model of density smd approach marenich et al 2009 the enthalpies δ h r 0 and free energies δ g r 0 of the reactions

reactants e 0 g corrected reactants where e 0 is the total electronic energy at t 0 k h corrected and g corrected are the thermal correction to enthalpy and gibbs free energy respectively the reaction activation energy δ g is the minimum energy needed for a reaction to proceed which can be calculated based on gibbs free energy of ts species 4 δ g tss e 0 g corrected tss reactants e 0 g corrected reactants in this study the δ g for set pathways is calculated according to the marcus theory marcus 1964 which has been widely used to investigate the set reaction pathway for radical and non radical bimolecular reactions the activation barrier δ g of a set reaction is defined as 5 δ g set λ 4 1 δ g set 0 λ where δ g set 0 is the gibbs free energy of the electron transfer reaction λ is the reorganization energy associated with the nuclear rearrangement involved in the formation of products in a set reaction which implies not only the nuclei of the reacting species but also those of the surrounding solvent the reorganization energy λ is calculated as 6 λ δ e set 0 δ g set 0 where δ e set 0 has been calculated as the non adiabatic energy difference between reactants and vertical products involving a change of charge and spin multiplicity at the same geometries the conventional transition state theory tst was used to calculate the reaction rate constant as follows 7 k tst σ k

and pressure 1 atm δ n 0 or 1 for bimolecular or unimolecular reaction respectively δ g t is the standard gibbs free energy of the activation for the considered reaction 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of phenol oxidation and reactive species in co ii paa system fig 1 a shows the degradation of phenol in different reaction processes almost no phenol degradation was observed by paa or co ii alone while more than 55 of phenol was degraded by co ii paa process at ph 7 0 it is also found that phenol is rarely degraded in the co ii h2o2 process which is consistent with the previous study that co ii is retarded in activating h2o2 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 it is also confirmed that oh was unlikely to be involved in this process as the addition of tert butyl alcohol tba had little impact on the phenol degradation fig 1a effects of co ii and paa dosages on phenol degradation were further investigated fig 1b and fig s1a exhibit that the removal efficiency of phenol increased from 23 9 to 69 0 and the corresponding k obs increased from 0 031 to 0 144 min 1 when the concentration of co ii increased from 2 to 25 μm in addition increasing the paa dosage from 0 05 to 0 4 mm significantly promoted the phenol degradation from 18 6 to 74 1 fig 1c and the k obs increased from 0 023 to 0 160 min 1 fig s1b it can be concluded that reactive species were generated in the co ii paa process and initiated the efficient degradation of phenol according to literatures anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 liu et al 2021a the mechanism for activation of paa by co ii at neutral ph has been proposed as follows with a co ii co iii cycle 8 co ii ch3c o ooh co iii ch3co2 oh 9 co iii ch3c o ooh co ii ch3co3 h the generated ch3co2 and ch3co3 may undergo further reactions with the production of secondary radicals i e ch3 ch3o2 and ho2 o2 as shown in text s3 based on the quenching experiments previous literatures have proposed that the secondary species most likely have a minor role if any in compounds degradation due to their poor oxidation capacities bielski et al 1985 neta et al 1990 li et al 2021 the acetyl per oxyl radicals ch3co2 and ch3co3 are much more powerful than other species in co ii paa aop system and the ch3co3 radical plays more important role than ch3co2 in compounds degradation kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 li et al 2021 liu et al 2021a ch3co3 may undergo bimolecular coupling to produce ch3co2 with a reaction rate constant k of 8 9 109 m 1 s 1 eq s1 meanwhile ch3co3 can undergo unimolecular decay to produce ho2 eq s2 k 1 82 s 1 which may further react with ch3co3 directly eq s3 k 2 0 106 m 1 s 1 kamath et al 2018 zhang and huang 2020 the formation of radicals in co ii paa system was also investigated by dmpo trapped epr spectroscopies fig 1d and table s1 the simulation based fitting of epr spectra indicated the formation of ch3co3 ah 11 7 g an 14 3 g ahγ 1 4 g and oh ah 14 9 g an 14 9 g in addition ch3co2 can not be simulated after fitting the epr spectra because ch3co2 is subjected to reaction with paa to form ch3co3 eq s4 and undergo rapid self decay eq s5 k 2 3 105 s 1 and self coupling eq s6 the failure of simulating for secondary radicals i e ch3 ch3o2 and ho2 o2 is likely to due to their high instability and or low concentration wang et al 2020 liu et al 2021a though the epr fitting results suggest the presence of oh the quenching results of tba confirmed the negligible role of oh in the co ii paa system instead the signal of dmpooh adduct signal may result from the decompose of dmpooo o ch3 adduct and or the generation of false positive spin adduct which has been widely observed in similar system in the presence of water and metals e g fe iii fe iv fe v cu ii and co iv miura et al 1995 verstraeten et al 2009 shao et al 2019 liu et al 2021a therefore based on the experimental results in this work and previous literatures it can be concluded that among all the radicals that involved in the co ii paa system under neutral condition ch3co3 is the major and most reactive radical for organic compounds degradation kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 liu et al 2021a 3 2 identification of phenol oxidation products the degradation products of phenol in conventional aops have been well studied generally including primary products of catechol hydroquinone benzoquinones bqs more oxidized ring opening products carboxylic acids and final mineralized products co2 and water anipsitakis et al 2006 lin et al 2011 olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 in this study table 1 presents the reaction intermediates analyzed by hplc and ms with full scan mode hplc dad analysis indicated catechol and hydroquinone with a retention time of 4 7 and 3 5 min respectively as shown in the full scan ms spectra fig s2 a total of five reaction products were identified with m z of 91 00 112 98 184 97 198 94 and 200 94 respectively the m z 91 00 was verified to be dihydroxyacetic acid a typical ring cleavage product meanwhile the m z 112 98 is its m na h form as dihydroxyacetic acid can react with na to form sodium dihydroxyacetate three compounds with high molecular weights mw were also observed among which the m z 184 97 is assigned to the dimerization product of phenol and identified to be 4 phenoxyphenol the m z 200 94 is 4 phenoxycatechol which is the hydroxylated form of 4 phenoxyphenol the m z 198 94 is the quinoid form of m z 200 94 as quinones are subject to getting reduced to generate their corresponding hydroquinone or catechol form the formation of 4 phenoxyphenol strongly demonstrated that phenoxy radical c6h5o was generated in this system it has been widely reported that during the oxidation of phenolic compounds by manganese oxide or enzymes laccase and or peroxidase enzyme various phenoxy radicals can be effectively produced through one electron oxidation and then polyphenol polymers with different polymerization degree will be yielded huang and weber 2004 du et al 2016a du et al 2016b it is well known that phenoxy radicals are the main reaction intermediates of haa and set routes for the initial step of radical induced phenol oxidation yang et al 2017 chen et al 2020 in comparison raf route usually produce radical adducts followed by the rapid reaction with o2 and scission to form hydroxylated products morales roque et al 2009 yang et al 2017 therefore it is difficult to propose the detailed mechanism of ch3co3 with phenol based on products identification 3 3 theoretical interpretations of phenol oxidation by ch3co3 due to the lack of direct experimental evidences the elucidation of reaction mechanism is discussed by means of theoretical methods in this study the possible pathways for the initial reaction of phenol with ch3co3 based on three mechanisms raf haa and set are illustrated in fig 2 these reactions represent the first step of the oxidative degradation of phenol by ch3co3 subsequent steps will lead to formation of deep oxidation and final reaction products the free energy and enthalpy of the reactions are calculated at the b3lyp 6 311 g b3lyp 6 31g level of theory using the smd water model fig 3 and table s2 present the results for the three different mechanisms among all the possible reactions only the pathway of haa of the h o7 is thermodynamically favorable δ g r 0 12 21 kcal mol 1 while the raf and set pathways are all nonspontaneous δ g r 0 0 furthermore all the reactions are endothermic δ h r 0 0 except for the haa of h o7 δ h r 0 10 69 kcal mol 1 the activation energy δ g and imaginary vibrational frequencies are also shown in table s2 in addition the searched geometries of tss and reaction products rps are presented in fig s3 and s4 fig 3 plots the relative tss and products energies for all the reaction pathways 3 3 1 radical adducts formation in the raf route for ch3co3 added on the four different c sites the enthalpy change δ h r 0 ranges from 4 94 to 7 26 kcal mol 1 with an average value of 6 07 kcal mol 1 whereas the free energy change δ g r 0 ranges from 8 47 to 11 17 kcal mol 1 the difference can be attributed to a large change in entropy as the reaction proceeds from two reactants to a single product the activation energy barrier δ g ranges from 9 35 to 13 45 kcal mol 1 average 11 67 kcal mol 1 the profile in fig 3 displays that the energy barriers for the addition of ch3co3 to ortho c2 and para c4 sites are very close while the energy barrier of c1 and meta c3 addition are higher by 3 kcal mol 1 this is because ch3co3 is a typical electrophilic radical and prefers to attack the electron rich sites of target substrate kim et al 2020 fig s5 suggests the electrophilic susceptible sites located at the ortho c2 and para c4 positions by the fukui index calculation see text s4 as c2 f 0 097 and c4 f 0 132 have the high fukui index values representing electrophilic attack although c1 site has the highest fukui index the saturated c leads to hard radical addition on this site however the positive values of free energy changes suggest that the raf mechanism for phenol oxidation by ch3co3 is unlikely to occur spontaneously it is reported that the loss of aromaticity for the radical addition products generally makes the raf route less favorable morales roque et al 2009 xiao et al 2014 guo et al 2020 steric effect is another adverse factor for raf route of ch3co3 attacking the parameter of van der waals mutual penetration distance mpd can be used to quantify the steric effect for radical addition which is calculated as the difference between the sum of non bonded atomic radii and the actual distance of studied atoms coughlin et al 2014 yang et al 2019 for example in the raf route between ch3co3 phenol at c4 para position the mpd value is calculated to be 0 73 å fig s6 similarly the mpd is determined to be 0 72 å and 0 70 å of that at c2 ortho and c3 meta position respectively the mpd values of the three raf routes are all lower than 1 å together with the electrostatic potential diffusion which indicates the existence of considerably strong steric effect in contrast the mpd values for oh addition to c2 ortho c3 meta and c4 para position are calculated to be 1 48 1 51 and 1 45 å respectively this agrees with previous studies that raf is the most favorable route in oh mediated phenol oxidation lundqvist and eriksson 2000 morales roque et al 2009 the activation energy barrier for oh addition to phenol was reported to be 4 11 to 5 69 kcal mol 1 average 4 86 kcal mol 1 at cbs qb3 level with free energy change ranging from 17 75 to 15 96 kcal mol 1 average 16 80 kcal mol 1 morales roque et al 2009 3 3 2 hydrogen atom abstraction the haa reactions can produce three different phenolic carbon centered radicals at c2 c3 and c4 and one phenoxy radical o7 fig 2b as shown in fig 3 and table s2 the change of phenolic carbon centered radical enthalpy ranges from 19 04 to 20 98 kcal mol 1 average 19 94 kcal mol 1 and free energy change ranges from 19 51 to 20 87 kcal mol 1 average 20 38 kcal mol 1 in comparison the phenoxy radical has an enthalpy of 10 69 kcal mol 1 and free energy change of 12 21 kcal mol 1 correspondingly the activation energy of haa from phenolic o h is only 4 78 kcal mol 1 whereas those of haa routes from phenolic c h are 16 kcal mol 1 higher this implies that the hydrogen abstraction from the phenolic hydroxyl group ho7 by ch3co3 is the dominant pathway leading to the phenoxy radical formation the bond dissociation energy bde is usually applied to assess the likely sites of haa reaction and lower bde suggests easier to break the bond for reaction in the case of haa routes the bdes for phenolic c h c2 c3 and c4 are calculated to be 113 6 112 1 and 113 1 kcal mol 1 respectively table s3 in contrast the bde for phenolic o h is only 84 2 kcal mol 1 which well supports our thermodynamics calculation results that haa of phenolic o h is more favorable the bde for oo h bond in paa molecule is verified to be 88 4 94 8 kcal mol 1 khursan and shereshovets 1996 therefore an exothermic process involves with energy of 4 2 10 6 kcal mol 1 which will serve as a driving force for the haa reaction similar mechanism was also reported in the haa routes of oh initiated triclosan oxidation as the lowest activation energy of 6 35 kcal mol 1 was found for the haa route on phenolic o h which was at least 7 kcal mol 1 lower than that for other haa routes gao et al 2014 3 3 3 single electron transfer in the set mechanism an electron transfers from phenol molecule to ch3co3 to form a radical cation and ch3c o oo phenol ch3co3 phenol ch3c o oo fig 2c fig s7 presents the electrostatic surface potential esp distribution of phenol which suggests the high regioselectivity of oxygen atom area for electron transfer the radical cation can then lose a proton to generate phenoxy radicals however this set route is thermodynamically unfavorable with enthalpy and free energy changes of 16 21 and 17 20 kcal mol 1 respectively fig 3 and table s2 the mechanism of set is unlikely to dominate the reaction which is in consistent with early findings that the energy change of set is usually higher than those of raf and haa olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 gao et al 2014 yang et al 2017 mei et al 2019 for instance the set routes in oh initiated oxidation of phenol and triclosan were found with reaction free energy of only 8 00 and 3 37 kcal mol 1 respectively whereas the reaction free energies of their most favorable routes are observed to be 17 75 raf for phenol and 35 61 haa for triclosan kcal mol 1 respectively morales roque et al 2009 olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 gao et al 2014 3 3 4 reaction kinetics constant for reaction of phenol with ch3co3 as shown in table s2 the reaction kinetics constants on phenol reaction with ch3co3 are then calculated through conventional transition state theory based on obtained activation energy barriers and arrhenius equation among the three reaction mechanisms the calculated rate constants for raf routes range from 8 51 102 to 8 64 105 m 1 s 1 since their corresponding reaction enthalpy and free energy changes are positive thus we exclude the possibility of the raf routes similarly the calculated rate constant for the set route is 8 97 10 1 m 1 s 1 suggesting that this reaction can hardly occur either for the haa routes the h abstraction from the phenolic o h is found with a rate constant of 1 94 109 m 1 s 1 whereas the rate constants of h abstraction from phenolic c h bonds range from 1 35 10 3 to 1 43 10 2 m 1 s 1 based on the above discussion and energy profiles thus we propose that the calculated rate constant for ch3co3 initiated oxidation of phenol is approximately 1 94 109 m 1 s 1 it is consistent with early findings that the reaction rate constants of ch3co3 with organic compounds are at the 108 109 m 1 s 1 level in water sawaki and ogata 1984 sawaki 1985 schuchmann and von sonntag 1988 neta et al 1990 neevel et al 1992 mortensen 2001 in comparison the rate constants for oh and so4 initiated phenol oxidation are slightly higher and reported to be 1 41 1010 and 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 respectively de et al 1999 lin et al 2011 it is in good accordance with that oh e 0 1 8 2 7 v and so4 e 0 2 5 3 1 v are more powerful oxidants than ch3co3 e 0 1 6 v neta et al 1988 merényi et al 1994 oh et al 2016 3 3 5 subsequent reactions for phenol oxidation through haa pathway based on the results discussed above the raf and set routes can be excluded from a thermodynamic perspective for all the haa routes hydrogen abstraction from phenolic o h is found to be the most favorable route for ch3co3 initiated oxidation of phenol leading to the formation of reactive phenoxy radicals although the initial attack of phenol by ch3co3 is haa mechanism continuous reactions upon radical attack will lead to deep oxidation therefore it is necessary to track the subsequent reactions of phenoxy radicals in this system it is known that the unpaired electron of the phenoxy radical will be relocated from oxygen to ortho carbon or para carbon the electronic structure of phenoxy radicals can be presented as an admixture of three resonance structures o o c and p c as displayed in fig s8 alsoufi et al 2010 chen et al 2020 in addition radical coupling is likely to be the primary subsequent reaction for phenoxy radicals including self coupling and cross coupling with ch3co3 alsoufi et al 2010 bimolecular phenoxy radical coupling is widely observed in numerous biological processes and would occur at the radical sites o o c and p c with unpaired electron producing six possible dimers as listed in table 2 this process is found to be barrierless due to the large fraction of spin located on the reaction sites alsoufi et al 2010 the thermodynamic ordering for the coupling products is similar to that given by previous studies asatryan et al 2005 alsoufi et al 2010 it can be seen that except for the coupling mode of o o combination δ h r 0 24 86 kcal mol 1 the formations of all products are exothermic based on the enthalpy change of the reactions δ h r 0 0 the o o combination of two phenoxy radicals is less favorable due to the highly negative spins on the phenolic oxygen asatryan et al 2005 the free energy change of reactions indicated that all coupling products can not be formed spontaneously except for d2 δ g r 0 0 95 kcal mol 1 and d3 δ g r 0 3 51 kcal mol 1 that result from the combination of phenolic o centered radical mesomer with o c and p c radical mesomer respectively d3 is the most thermodynamically favored product and it can further evolve into 4 phenoxyphenol through tautomerization with an exothermic reaction free energy of 19 76 kcal mol 1 fig s9 the energy barriers for hydrogen transfers through water bridging are small the d3 intermediate can easily regain ring aromaticity in water guo et al 2020 it is consistent with the previous results that 4 phenoxyphenol is frequently detected as the primary product of phenoxy radical self coupling process platz et al 1998 wiater et al 2000 olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 phenoxy radical may also get attacked by ch3co3 at sites o c or p c forming two different cross coupling adducts fig 4 the reaction enthalpy change is 28 15 kcal mol 1 for the adduct with o o c combination and 31 06 kcal mol 1 for that with o p c combination while the free energy changes for o o c and o p c combinations are 14 12 and 18 12 kcal mol 1 respectively this suggests the cross coupling of ch3co3 with phenoxy radical with o o c and o p c combinations are both thermodynamically favorable nevertheless the two adducts are unstable due to the poor ring aromaticity and are likely to undergo further h transfer and o o bond cleavage as presented in fig 4 wu et al 2016 guo et al 2020 accordingly 1 2 bq and 1 4 bq can be produced with exothermic energy of 75 59 and 77 32 kcal mol 1 respectively based on the results of products identification ch3co3 may further react with the bqs intermediates to generate final ring opening products such as dihydroxyacetic acid m z 91 00 to note early literature has reported that ch3co3 is a powerful oxidant for organic compounds degradation bond breaking products were commonly observed ao et al 2021 li et al 2021 3 4 reaction mechanisms and overall pathways according to the verified reaction products and calculated energy profiles the overall reaction pathways for the ch3co3 driven oxidation of phenol are thus proposed as shown in fig 5 the reaction pathways include haa dimerization self coupling and cross coupling followed by tautomerization hydrogen transfer bond breaking and further ring opening fig 6 also presents the free energy profile of ch3co3 induced phenol degradation the oxidation of phenol is initialized by ch3co3 with the generation of phenoxy radicals according to the results of reaction products identification and theoretical calculations this step is proposed to occur through haa mechanism ch3co3 can abstract one hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group of phenol structure which is found with energy barrier of 4 78 kcal mol 1 and free energy change of 12 21 kcal mol 1 and the corresponding reaction rate constant is calculated to be 1 94 109 m 1 s 1 in contrast raf is proposed to be the predominant route for oh initialized phenol oxidation in early researches lundqvist and eriksson 2000 morales roque et al 2009 this difference is attributed to the oxidative capacity steric effect and electrophilicity of these two radicals oh e h 0 1 8 2 72 v is a more oxidative radical than ch3co3 e h 0 1 60 v merényi et al 1994 huber et al 2003 additionally the van der waals molecular volume v m of oh is calculated to be 22 13 å3 which is much less than 71 97 å3 of ch3co3 resulting in much higher mpd values liu et al 2021b meanwhile according to the calculated electrophilicity index ω text s5 and table s4 oh ω 2 81 ev is a more electrophilic radical than ch3co3 ω 2 28 ev which also facilitates the electrophilic radical addition reaction of oh with phenol de vleeschouwer et al 2007 the formed phenoxy radicals are quite reactive and prone to couple with each other to generate polymers and it is worth noting that the condensation of phenoxy radicals has been widely reported as one of the important humification processes zhang and huang 2003 huang and weber 2004 du et al 2016a du et al 2016b a dimer of phenoxy radical was observed in this study which further confirms the involvement of phenoxy radical pathways according to the energy profile 4 phenoxyphenol with o p c combination is thus proposed phenoxy radicals may also react with ch3co3 however the formed radical coupling intermediates are unstable in addition subsequent tautomerization and bond breaking reactions will occur with the formation of more stable degradation products as o bq and p bq bqs easily get reduced to generate corresponding hqs such as catechol and hydroquinone reported in the present studies anipsitakis et al 2006 olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 moreover as the formed 4 phenoxyphenol is also a phenolic substrate it is likely to undergo the same attacks by ch3co3 this is in accordance with the ms results that 4 phenoxycatechol and its oxidized form 4 phenoxy o benzoquinone were identified in this study ring opening is proposed to be another important pathway in this system as dihydroxyacetic acid and sodium dihydroxyacetate were successfully identified though ch3co3 is a weaker oxidant than oh and so4 bond cleavage and ring opening could also occur during the ch3co3 driven oxidation of organic compounds cai et al 2017 chen et al 2019 kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 in summary ch3co3 is a reactive electrophilic radical but having steric effect and the reaction routes for ch3co3 initialized organic contaminants oxidation are different depending on physicochemical properties of substrates specifically raf route is likely to occur in the reaction of ch3co3 with highly conjugated compounds such as β carotene and ketones sawaki and ogata 1984 neevel et al 1992 mortensen 2001 however set mechanism is more likely to occur in the oxidation of reducing compounds i e vitamin c and n n n n tetramethyl p phenylenediamine schuchmann and von sonntag 1988 in comparison haa route generally dominates the oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons such as alkanes and aliphatic alcohols similar to oh and so4 lee et al 2020 ao et al 2021 although the results in this work can suggest the haa route for some phenolic compounds oxidation by ch3co3 more studies are needed to further explore the reaction mechanism of ch3co3 with different aromatic compounds future researches regarding the identification of short lived intermediates using epr transient absorption spectra and quantum calculation methods are desired 4 conclusions this work is among the first to investigate the transformation of the typical organic compound phenol in the co ii paa process using both experimental and theoretical methods and provides new knowledge regarding the ch3co3 driven oxidation process 1 phenol can be effectively oxidized in the co ii paa system and the verified reaction products included 4 phenoxyphenol and its hydroxylated derivatives catechol hydroquinone and further ring opening carboxylic acids 2 haa is demonstrated to be the dominant reaction route for the reaction of ch3co3 with phenol the initial step is found with an activation energy of 4 78 kcal mol 1 and free energy change of 12 21 kcal mol 1 to produce phenoxy radicals moreover the reaction rate constant between ch3co3 and phenol is calculated to be 1 94 109 m 1 s 1 3 phenoxy radicals could subsequently undergo a series of reactions including resonance stabilization radical coupling tautomerization bond cleavage and further ring opening reactions our results provide direct experimental and theoretical evidences for reaction mechanism elucidation in ch3co3 driven oxidation of phenol at the molecular level in the future model organic contaminants with

16262,peracetic acid paa has been widely used as an alternative disinfectant in wastewater treatment and paa based advanced oxidation processes aops have drawn increasing attention recently among the generated reactive species after paa activation acetylperoxyl radical ch3co3 plays an important role in organic compounds degradation however little is known about the reaction mechanism on ch3co3 attack due to the challenging of experimental analysis in this study a homogeneous paa activation system was built up using co ii as an activator at neutral ph to generate ch3co3 for phenol degradation more importantly reaction mechanism on ch3co3 driven oxidation of phenol is elucidated at the molecular level ch3co3 with lower electrophilicity index but much larger waals molecular volume holds different phenol oxidation route compared with the conventional oh direct evidences on ch3co3 formation and attack mechanism are provided through integrated experimental and theoretical results indicating that hydrogen atom abstraction haa is the most favorable route in the initial step of ch3co3 driven phenol oxidation haa reaction step is found to produce phenoxy radicals with a low energy barrier of 4 78 kcal mol 1 and free energy change of 12 21 kcal mol 1 the generated phenoxy radicals will undergo further dimerization to form 4 phenoxyphenol and corresponding hydroxylated products or react with ch3co3 to generate catechol and hydroquinone these results significantly promote the understanding of ch3co3 driven organic pollutant degradation and are useful for further development of paa based aops in environmental applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid advanced oxidation process acetylperoxyl radical hydrogen atom

conventional oh aops have shown good efficiency for water disinfection and decontamination huber et al 2003 however the oh aops can be readily inhibited by complex water matrices such as the natural organic matter and inorganic ions matta et al 2011 in contrast paa based aops show higher sterilization efficiency lower ph dependence and easier technical implementation in inactivating pathogens and eliminating organic pollutants in water cai et al 2017 sun et al 2018 ao et al 2021 in addition the o oh bond energy of paa 38 kcal mol 1 is lower than that of h2o2 51 kcal mol 1 which also facilitates the paa activation process with lower energy bianchini et al 2002 reactive radicals including oh ch3co3 ch3co2 ch3 ch3o2 and ho2 can be produced by cleaving the peroxide bond in paa molecule via energy or electron transfer reactions ao et al 2021 among the produced radicals oh e h 0 1 8 2 72 v ch3co2 e h 0 2 24 v and ch3co3 e h 0 1 60 v have been proposed to play dominant roles in contaminants degradation while the others contribute little because of their poor oxidation capacity instability or complicated side reactions merényi et al 1994 huber et al 2003 lu and continetti 2004 kim et al 2020 to note recent literatures have reported that ch3co2 easily undergoes self decomposition k 2 3 105 s 1 and contributes much less than ch3co3 and oh radicals kim et al 2020 zhang and huang 2020 li et al 2021 in a typical paa based aop ch3co3 and or oh radicals are more likely to dominate the efficient degradation of organic contaminants cai et al 2017 chen et al 2019 ao et al 2021 li et al 2021 in typical aops e g uv h2o2 uv tio2 and o3 h2o2 oh is the most common reactive species which can rapidly and non selectively react with most organic compounds for degradation and even complete mineralization huber et al 2003 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 in paa aop systems oh can be produced through activation of coexisting h2o2 and or paa the mechanism for oh attacking organic pollutants have been well documented including 1 hydrogen atom abstraction haa pathway for the oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons 2 radical adducts formation raf pathway for alkenes and most aromatic ring papagni et al 2001 in comparison single electron transfer set mechanism is less favorable in the oh induced reaction as suggested by theoretical methods gao et al 2014 luo et al 2018 besides oh ch3co3 also plays an important role in paa aop systems however research on mechanism of ch3co3 initiated oxidation of organic compounds is very limited due to interference of coexisting radicals and extremely short life of ch3co3 it is difficult to characterize corresponding reaction intermediates resulting from ch3co3 attacking recently co ii paa process has been reported as a special paa aop system in which ch3co3 is proposed to be the dominant reactive species under neutral condition kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 liu et al 2021a this provides a great opportunity to clarify the behavior of ch3co3 without the influence of other species though several reaction routes have been guessed based on the products identification and quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 li et al 2021 underlying mechanism on the oxidation of organic compounds by ch3co3 in the paa aop system remains unanswered in addition capturing and identification of transient species in different pathways is quite an analytical challenge therefore an improved mechanistic understanding of the reaction of organic compounds with ch3co3 is desired quantum calculation methods offer an available way to investigate the behavior of radical oxidation processes especially when the experimental analysis is technically challenging for example oh mediated oxidation of ibuprofen has been studied by constructing energy profiles for different reaction routes with density functional theory dft calculation xiao et al 2014 and haa pathway is found to be the most favorable it is also proposed that triclosan can be initially attacked by oh in both raf and haa routes using the quantum chemical approach gao et al 2014 moreover previous research has studied the first step of so4 initiated degradation of 76 aromatic compounds with quantum mechanics based calculations and showed that the set pathway is an important reaction mechanism luo et al 2017 it is thus believed that quantum calculation methods can also help us to better understand the ch3co3 initiated organic compounds oxidation reactions therefore this study is conducted with the aim of elucidating the mechanisms of ch3co3 driven oxidation of organic contaminants through integrated experimental and theoretical methods co ii paa process at neutral ph was experimentally employed to produce ch3co3 as the dominant reactive species for reaction as complicated organic molecules have too many reactions sites in this study phenol a classical organic pollutant with typical structure was selected as the target organic compound first the degradation efficiency of phenol in co ii paa process was investigated and the reaction products were carefully identified then after constructing the energy profiles of three different pathways haa raf and set the mechanism of ch3co3 mediated phenol oxidation was proposed based on the detected reaction intermediates and dft calculations this study can provide deep insights into the reaction of ch3co3 with organic compounds in paa aop system and promote the application of the paa aop in real water treatment area 2 materials and methods 2 1 oxidation of phenol in co ii paa process chemicals used in this study are presented in text s1 of supplementary data the co ii paa process under neutral condition is applied to study the ch3co3 driven oxidation of phenol as ch3co3 is the major and most reactive radical for compounds degradation in this system kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 liu et al 2021a the oxidation experiments were conducted in batch reactors 100 ml amber borosilicate glass vials with constant magnetic stirring at room temperature 22 0 5 c in a typical reaction system solution in the vial contained 10 μm phenol and 0 1 mm paa the initial solution ph was adjusted to 7 0 by adding diluted naoh 0 5 m or h2so4 0 5 m solution then co ch3coo 2 solution was added as co ii source final concentration of 10 μm to initiate the reaction sample aliquots 1 ml were taken regularly into high performance liquid chromatography hplc vials in which 10 μl of 0 1 m sodium thiosulfate solution was pre injected to quench the reaction immediately for further analysis for the experiment on effect of co ii co ii concentration was varied as 2 25 μm while for effect of paa paa dosage was varied as 0 05 0 4 mm all the experiments were conducted in duplicated and control tests on phenol degradation with paa or co ii added alone were also carried out the pseudo first order model is introduced to describe the phenol degradation kinetics which is expressed as 1 k obs ln c t c 0 t where c t and c 0 are the real time and initial concentration of phenol μm respectively t is the reaction time min 2 2 analytical methods the residue concentration of

nelder and mead method which is incorporated in easyspin the best fit was obtained by minimizing the root mean square deviation rmsd between experimental and simulated spectra the best fit resulted in a very small residual value of rsmd of 0 126 table s1 shows the simulation results 2 3 computational methods all quantum chemical calculations were performed using the gaussian 16 program revision c

kinetics of phenol oxidation and reactive species in co ii paa system fig 1 a shows the degradation of phenol in different reaction processes almost no phenol degradation was observed by paa or co ii alone while more than 55 of phenol was degraded by co ii paa process at ph 7 0 it is also found that phenol is rarely degraded in the co ii h2o2 process which is consistent with the previous study that co ii is retarded in activating h2o2 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 it is also confirmed that oh was unlikely to be involved in this process as the addition of tert butyl alcohol tba had little impact on the phenol degradation fig 1a effects of co ii and paa dosages on phenol degradation were further investigated fig 1b and fig s1a exhibit that the removal efficiency of phenol increased from 23 9 to 69 0 and the corresponding k obs increased from 0 031 to 0 144 min 1 when the concentration of co ii increased from 2 to 25 μm in addition increasing the paa dosage from 0 05 to 0 4 mm significantly promoted the phenol degradation from 18 6 to 74 1 fig 1c and the k obs increased from 0 023 to 0 160 min 1 fig s1b it can be concluded that reactive species were generated in the co ii paa process and initiated the efficient degradation of phenol according to literatures anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 liu et al 2021a the mechanism for activation of paa by co ii at neutral ph has been proposed as follows with a co ii co iii cycle 8 co ii ch3c o ooh co iii ch3co2 oh 9 co iii ch3c o ooh co ii ch3co3 h the generated ch3co2 and ch3co3 may undergo further reactions with the production of secondary radicals i e ch3 ch3o2 and ho2 o2 as shown in text s3 based on the quenching experiments previous literatures have proposed that the secondary species most likely have a minor role if any in compounds degradation due to their poor oxidation capacities bielski et al 1985 neta et al 1990 li et al 2021 the acetyl per oxyl radicals ch3co2 and ch3co3 are much more powerful than other species in co ii paa aop system and the ch3co3 radical plays more important role than ch3co2 in compounds degradation kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 li et al 2021 liu et al 2021a ch3co3 may undergo bimolecular coupling to produce ch3co2 with a reaction rate constant k of 8 9 109 m 1 s 1 eq s1 meanwhile ch3co3 can undergo unimolecular decay to produce ho2 eq s2 k 1 82 s 1 which may further react with ch3co3 directly eq s3 k 2 0 106 m 1 s 1 kamath et al 2018 zhang and huang 2020 the formation of radicals in co ii paa system was also investigated by dmpo trapped epr spectroscopies fig 1d and table s1 the simulation based fitting of epr spectra indicated the formation of ch3co3 ah 11 7 g an 14 3 g ahγ 1 4 g and oh ah 14 9 g an 14 9 g in addition ch3co2 can not be simulated after fitting the epr spectra because ch3co2 is subjected to reaction with paa to form ch3co3 eq s4 and undergo rapid self decay eq s5 k 2 3 105 s 1 and self coupling eq s6 the failure of simulating for secondary radicals i e ch3 ch3o2 and ho2 o2 is likely to due to their high instability and or low concentration wang et al 2020 liu et al 2021a though the epr fitting results suggest the presence of oh the quenching results of tba confirmed the negligible role of oh in the co ii paa system instead the signal of dmpooh adduct signal may result from the decompose of dmpooo o ch3 adduct and or the generation of false positive spin adduct which has been widely observed in similar system in the presence of water and metals e g fe iii fe iv fe v cu ii and co iv miura et al 1995 verstraeten et al 2009 shao et al 2019 liu et al 2021a therefore based on the experimental results in this work and previous literatures it can be concluded that among all the radicals that involved in the co ii paa system under neutral condition ch3co3 is the major and most reactive radical for organic compounds degradation kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 liu et al 2021a 3 2 identification of phenol oxidation products the degradation products of phenol in conventional aops have been well studied generally including primary products of catechol hydroquinone benzoquinones bqs more oxidized ring opening products carboxylic acids and final mineralized products co2 and water anipsitakis et al 2006 lin et al 2011 olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 in this study table 1 presents the reaction intermediates analyzed by hplc and ms with full scan mode hplc dad analysis indicated catechol and hydroquinone with a retention time of 4 7 and 3 5 min respectively as shown in the full scan ms spectra fig s2 a total of five reaction products were identified with m z of 91 00 112 98 184 97 198 94 and 200 94 respectively the m z 91 00 was verified to be dihydroxyacetic acid a typical ring cleavage product meanwhile the m z 112 98 is its m na h form as dihydroxyacetic acid can react with na to form sodium dihydroxyacetate three compounds with high molecular weights mw were also observed among which the m z 184 97 is assigned to the dimerization product of phenol and identified to be 4 phenoxyphenol the m z 200 94 is 4 phenoxycatechol which is the hydroxylated form of 4 phenoxyphenol the m z 198 94 is the quinoid form of m z 200 94 as quinones are subject to getting reduced to generate their corresponding hydroquinone or catechol form the formation of 4 phenoxyphenol strongly demonstrated that phenoxy radical c6h5o was generated in this system it has been widely reported that during the oxidation of phenolic compounds by manganese oxide or enzymes laccase and or peroxidase enzyme various phenoxy radicals can be effectively produced through one electron oxidation and then polyphenol polymers with different polymerization degree will be yielded huang and weber 2004 du et al 2016a du et al 2016b it is well known that phenoxy radicals are the main reaction intermediates of haa and set routes for the initial step of radical induced phenol oxidation yang et al 2017 chen et al 2020 in comparison raf route usually produce radical adducts followed by the rapid reaction with o2 and scission to form hydroxylated products morales roque et al 2009 yang et al 2017 therefore it is difficult to propose the detailed mechanism of ch3co3 with phenol based on products identification 3 3 theoretical interpretations of phenol oxidation by ch3co3 due to the lack of direct experimental evidences the elucidation of reaction mechanism is discussed by means of theoretical methods in this study the possible pathways for the initial reaction of phenol with ch3co3 based on three mechanisms raf haa and set are illustrated in fig 2 these reactions represent the first step of the oxidative degradation of phenol by ch3co3 subsequent steps will lead to formation of deep oxidation and final reaction products the free energy and enthalpy of the reactions are calculated at the b3lyp 6 311 g b3lyp 6 31g level of theory using the smd water model fig 3 and table s2 present the results for the three different mechanisms among all the possible reactions only the pathway of haa of the h o7 is thermodynamically favorable δ g r 0 12 21 kcal mol 1 while the raf and set pathways are all nonspontaneous δ g r 0 0 furthermore all the reactions are endothermic δ h r 0 0 except for the haa of h o7 δ h r 0 10 69 kcal mol 1 the activation energy δ g and imaginary vibrational frequencies are also shown in table s2 in addition the searched geometries of tss and reaction products rps are presented in fig s3 and s4 fig 3 plots the relative tss and products energies for all the reaction pathways 3 3 1 radical adducts formation in the raf route for ch3co3 added on the four different c sites the enthalpy change δ h r 0 ranges from 4 94 to 7 26 kcal mol 1 with an average value of 6 07 kcal mol 1 whereas the free energy change δ g r 0 ranges from 8 47 to 11 17 kcal mol 1 the difference can be attributed to a large change in entropy as the reaction proceeds from two reactants to a single product the activation energy barrier δ g ranges from 9 35 to 13 45 kcal mol 1 average 11 67 kcal mol 1 the profile in fig 3 displays that the energy barriers for the addition of ch3co3 to ortho c2 and para c4 sites are very close while the energy barrier of c1 and meta c3 addition are higher by 3 kcal mol 1 this is because ch3co3 is a typical electrophilic radical and prefers to attack the electron rich sites of target substrate kim et al 2020 fig s5 suggests the electrophilic susceptible sites located at the ortho c2 and para c4 positions by the fukui index calculation see text s4 as c2 f 0 097 and c4 f 0 132 have the high fukui index values representing electrophilic attack although c1 site has the highest fukui index the saturated c leads to hard radical addition on this site however the positive values of free energy changes suggest that the raf mechanism for phenol oxidation by ch3co3 is unlikely to occur spontaneously it is reported that the loss of aromaticity for the radical addition products generally makes the raf route less favorable morales roque et al 2009 xiao et al 2014 guo et al 2020 steric effect is another adverse factor for raf route of ch3co3 attacking the parameter of van der waals mutual penetration distance mpd can be used to quantify the steric effect for radical addition which is calculated as the difference between the sum of non bonded atomic radii and the actual distance of studied atoms coughlin et al 2014 yang et al 2019 for example in the raf route between ch3co3 phenol at c4 para position the mpd value is calculated to be 0 73 å fig s6 similarly the mpd is determined to be 0 72 å and 0 70 å of that at c2 ortho and c3 meta position respectively the mpd values of the three raf routes are all lower than 1 å together with the electrostatic potential diffusion which indicates the existence of considerably strong steric effect in contrast the mpd values for oh addition to c2 ortho c3 meta and c4 para position are calculated to be 1 48 1 51 and 1 45 å respectively this agrees with previous studies that raf is the most favorable route in oh mediated phenol oxidation lundqvist and eriksson 2000 morales roque et al 2009 the activation energy barrier for oh addition to phenol was reported to be 4 11 to 5 69 kcal mol 1 average 4 86 kcal mol 1 at cbs qb3 level with free energy change ranging from 17 75 to 15 96 kcal mol 1 average 16 80 kcal mol 1 morales roque et al 2009 3 3 2 hydrogen atom abstraction the haa reactions can produce three different phenolic carbon centered radicals at c2 c3 and c4 and one phenoxy radical o7 fig 2b as shown in fig 3 and table s2 the change of phenolic carbon centered radical enthalpy ranges from 19 04 to 20 98 kcal mol 1 average 19 94 kcal mol 1 and free energy change ranges from 19 51 to 20 87 kcal mol 1 average 20 38 kcal mol 1 in comparison the phenoxy radical has an enthalpy of 10 69 kcal mol 1 and free energy change of 12 21 kcal mol 1 correspondingly the activation energy of haa from phenolic o h is only 4 78 kcal mol 1 whereas those of haa routes from phenolic c h are 16 kcal mol 1 higher this implies that the hydrogen abstraction from the phenolic hydroxyl group ho7 by ch3co3 is the dominant pathway leading to the phenoxy radical formation the bond dissociation energy bde is usually applied to assess the likely sites of haa reaction and lower bde suggests easier to break the bond for reaction in the case of haa routes the bdes for phenolic c h c2 c3 and c4 are calculated to be 113 6 112 1 and 113 1 kcal mol 1 respectively table s3 in contrast the bde for phenolic o h is only 84 2 kcal mol 1 which well supports our thermodynamics calculation results that haa of phenolic o h is more favorable the bde for oo h bond in paa molecule is verified to be 88 4 94 8 kcal mol 1 khursan and shereshovets 1996 therefore an exothermic process involves with energy of 4 2 10 6 kcal mol 1 which will serve as a driving force for the haa reaction similar mechanism was also reported in the haa routes of oh initiated triclosan oxidation as the lowest activation energy of 6 35 kcal mol 1 was found for the haa route on phenolic o h which was at least 7 kcal mol 1 lower than that for other haa routes gao et al 2014 3 3 3 single electron transfer in the set mechanism an electron transfers from phenol molecule to ch3co3 to form a radical cation and ch3c o oo phenol ch3co3 phenol ch3c o oo fig 2c fig s7 presents the electrostatic surface potential esp distribution of phenol which suggests the high regioselectivity of oxygen atom area for electron transfer the radical cation can then lose a proton to generate phenoxy radicals however this set route is thermodynamically unfavorable with enthalpy and free energy changes of 16 21 and 17 20 kcal mol 1 respectively fig 3 and table s2 the mechanism of set is unlikely to dominate the reaction which is in consistent with early findings that the energy change of set is usually higher than those of raf and haa olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 gao et al 2014 yang et al 2017 mei et al 2019 for instance the set routes in oh initiated oxidation of phenol and triclosan were found with reaction free energy of only 8 00 and 3 37 kcal mol 1 respectively whereas the reaction free energies of their most favorable routes are observed to be 17 75 raf for phenol and 35 61 haa for triclosan kcal mol 1 respectively morales roque et al 2009 olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 gao et al 2014 3 3 4 reaction kinetics constant for reaction of phenol with ch3co3 as shown in table s2 the reaction kinetics constants on phenol reaction with ch3co3 are then calculated through conventional transition state theory based on obtained activation energy barriers and arrhenius equation among the three reaction mechanisms the calculated rate constants for raf routes range from 8 51 102 to 8 64 105 m 1 s 1 since their corresponding reaction enthalpy and free energy changes are positive thus we exclude the possibility of the raf routes similarly the calculated rate constant for the set route is 8 97 10 1 m 1 s 1 suggesting that this reaction can hardly occur either for the haa routes the h abstraction from the phenolic o h is found with a rate constant of 1 94 109 m 1 s 1 whereas the rate constants of h abstraction from phenolic c h bonds range from 1 35 10 3 to 1 43 10 2 m 1 s 1 based on the above discussion and energy profiles thus we propose that the calculated rate constant for ch3co3 initiated oxidation of phenol is approximately 1 94 109 m 1 s 1 it is consistent with early findings that the reaction rate constants of ch3co3 with organic compounds are at the 108 109 m 1 s 1 level in water sawaki and ogata 1984 sawaki 1985 schuchmann and von sonntag 1988 neta et al 1990 neevel et al 1992 mortensen 2001 in comparison the rate constants for oh and so4 initiated phenol oxidation are slightly higher and reported to be 1 41 1010 and 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 respectively de et al 1999 lin et al 2011 it is in good accordance with that oh e 0 1 8 2 7 v and so4 e 0 2 5 3 1 v are more powerful oxidants than ch3co3 e 0 1 6 v neta et al 1988 merényi et al 1994 oh et al 2016 3 3 5 subsequent reactions for phenol oxidation through haa pathway based on the results discussed above the raf and set routes can be excluded from a thermodynamic perspective for all the haa routes hydrogen abstraction from phenolic o h is found to be the most favorable route for ch3co3 initiated oxidation of phenol leading to the formation of reactive phenoxy radicals although the initial attack of phenol by ch3co3 is haa mechanism continuous reactions upon radical attack will lead to deep oxidation therefore it is necessary to track the subsequent reactions of phenoxy radicals in this system it is known that the unpaired electron of the phenoxy radical will be relocated from oxygen to ortho carbon or para carbon the electronic structure of phenoxy radicals can be presented as an admixture of three resonance structures o o c and p c as displayed in fig s8 alsoufi et al 2010 chen et al 2020 in addition radical coupling is likely to be the primary subsequent reaction for phenoxy radicals including self coupling and cross coupling with ch3co3 alsoufi et al 2010 bimolecular phenoxy radical coupling is widely observed in numerous biological processes and would occur at the radical sites o o c and p c with unpaired electron producing six possible dimers as listed in table 2 this process is found to be barrierless due to the large fraction of spin located on the reaction sites alsoufi et al 2010 the thermodynamic ordering for the coupling products is similar to that given by previous studies asatryan et al 2005 alsoufi et al 2010 it can be seen that except for the coupling mode of o o combination δ h r 0 24 86 kcal mol 1 the formations of all products are exothermic based on the enthalpy change of the reactions δ h r 0 0 the o o combination of two phenoxy radicals is less favorable due to the highly negative spins on the phenolic oxygen asatryan et al 2005 the free energy change of reactions indicated that all coupling products can not be formed spontaneously except for d2 δ g r 0 0 95 kcal mol 1 and d3 δ g r 0 3 51 kcal mol 1 that result from the combination of phenolic o centered radical mesomer with o c and p c radical mesomer respectively d3 is the most thermodynamically favored product and it can further evolve into 4 phenoxyphenol through tautomerization with an exothermic reaction free energy of 19 76 kcal mol 1 fig s9 the energy barriers for hydrogen transfers through water bridging are small the d3 intermediate can easily regain ring aromaticity in water guo et al 2020 it is consistent with the previous results that 4 phenoxyphenol is frequently detected as the primary product of phenoxy radical self coupling process platz et al 1998 wiater et al 2000 olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 phenoxy radical may also get attacked by ch3co3 at sites o c or p c forming two different cross coupling adducts fig 4 the reaction enthalpy change is 28 15 kcal mol 1 for the adduct with o o c combination and 31 06 kcal mol 1 for that with o p c combination while the free energy changes for o o c and o p c combinations are 14 12 and 18 12 kcal mol 1 respectively this suggests the cross coupling of ch3co3 with phenoxy radical with o o c and o p c combinations are both thermodynamically favorable nevertheless the two adducts are unstable due to the poor ring aromaticity and are likely to undergo further h transfer and o o bond cleavage as presented in fig 4 wu et al 2016 guo et al 2020 accordingly 1 2 bq and 1 4 bq can be produced with exothermic energy of 75 59 and 77 32 kcal mol 1 respectively based on the results of products identification ch3co3 may further react with the bqs intermediates to generate final ring opening products such as dihydroxyacetic acid m z 91 00 to note early literature has reported that ch3co3 is a powerful oxidant for organic compounds degradation bond breaking products were commonly observed ao et al 2021 li et al 2021 3 4 reaction mechanisms and overall pathways according to the verified reaction products and calculated energy profiles the overall reaction pathways for the ch3co3 driven oxidation of phenol are thus proposed as shown in fig 5 the reaction pathways include haa dimerization self coupling and cross coupling followed by tautomerization hydrogen transfer bond breaking and further ring opening fig 6 also presents the free energy profile of ch3co3 induced phenol degradation the oxidation of phenol is initialized by ch3co3 with the generation of phenoxy radicals according to the results of reaction products identification and theoretical calculations this step is proposed to occur through haa mechanism ch3co3 can abstract one hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group of phenol structure which is found with energy barrier of 4 78 kcal mol 1 and free energy change of 12 21 kcal mol 1 and the corresponding reaction rate constant is calculated to be 1 94 109 m 1 s 1 in contrast raf is proposed to be the predominant route for oh initialized phenol oxidation in early researches lundqvist and eriksson 2000 morales roque et al 2009 this difference is attributed to the oxidative capacity steric effect and electrophilicity of these two radicals oh e h 0 1 8 2 72 v is a more oxidative radical than ch3co3 e h 0 1 60 v merényi et al 1994 huber et al 2003 additionally the van der waals molecular volume v m of oh is calculated to be 22 13 å3 which is much less than 71 97 å3 of ch3co3 resulting in much higher mpd values liu et al 2021b meanwhile according to the calculated electrophilicity index ω text s5 and table s4 oh ω 2 81 ev is a more electrophilic radical than ch3co3 ω 2 28 ev which also facilitates the electrophilic radical addition reaction of oh with phenol de vleeschouwer et al 2007 the formed phenoxy radicals are quite reactive and prone to couple with each other to generate polymers and it is worth noting that the condensation of phenoxy radicals has been widely reported as one of the important humification processes zhang and huang 2003 huang and weber 2004 du et al 2016a du et al 2016b a dimer of phenoxy radical was observed in this study which further confirms the involvement of phenoxy radical pathways according to the energy profile 4 phenoxyphenol with o p c combination is thus proposed phenoxy radicals may also react with ch3co3 however the formed radical coupling intermediates are unstable in addition subsequent tautomerization and bond breaking reactions will occur with the formation of more stable degradation products as o bq and p bq bqs easily get reduced to generate corresponding hqs such as catechol and hydroquinone reported in the present studies anipsitakis et al 2006 olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 moreover as the formed 4 phenoxyphenol is also a phenolic substrate it is likely to undergo the same attacks by ch3co3 this is in accordance with the ms results that 4 phenoxycatechol and its oxidized form 4 phenoxy o benzoquinone were identified in this study ring opening is proposed to be another important pathway in this system as dihydroxyacetic acid and sodium dihydroxyacetate were successfully identified though ch3co3 is a weaker oxidant than oh and so4 bond cleavage and ring opening could also occur during the ch3co3 driven oxidation of organic compounds cai et al 2017 chen et al 2019 kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 in summary ch3co3 is a reactive electrophilic radical but having steric effect and the reaction routes for ch3co3 initialized organic contaminants oxidation are different depending on physicochemical properties of substrates specifically raf route is likely to occur in the reaction of ch3co3 with highly conjugated compounds such as β carotene and ketones sawaki and ogata 1984 neevel et al 1992 mortensen 2001 however set mechanism is more likely to occur in the oxidation of reducing compounds i e vitamin c and n n n n tetramethyl p phenylenediamine schuchmann and von sonntag 1988 in comparison haa route generally dominates the oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons such as alkanes and aliphatic alcohols similar to oh and so4 lee et al 2020 ao et al 2021 although the results in this work can suggest the haa route for some phenolic compounds oxidation by ch3co3 more studies are needed to further explore the reaction mechanism of ch3co3 with different aromatic compounds future researches regarding the identification of short lived intermediates using epr transient absorption spectra and quantum calculation methods are desired 4 conclusions this work is among the first to investigate the transformation of the typical organic compound phenol in the co ii paa process using both experimental and theoretical methods and provides new knowledge regarding the ch3co3 driven oxidation process 1 phenol can be effectively oxidized in the co ii paa system and the verified reaction products included 4 phenoxyphenol and its hydroxylated derivatives catechol hydroquinone and further ring opening carboxylic acids 2 haa is demonstrated to be the dominant reaction route for the reaction of ch3co3 with phenol the initial step is found with an activation energy of 4 78 kcal mol 1 and free energy change of 12 21 kcal mol 1 to produce phenoxy radicals moreover the reaction rate constant between ch3co3 and phenol is calculated to be 1 94 109 m 1 s 1 3 phenoxy radicals could subsequently undergo a series of reactions including resonance stabilization radical coupling tautomerization bond cleavage and further ring opening reactions our results provide direct experimental and theoretical evidences for reaction mechanism elucidation in ch3co3 driven oxidation of phenol at the molecular level in the future model organic contaminants with complicated structure or of high environmental significance can be select to further deeply study the ch3co3 attacking mechanisms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

the semi arid coastal areas groundwater is the fundamental resource for agricultural and environmental systems the intensive irrigation behaviors generate huge water stress and result in seawater intrusion swi in the coastal aquifer puggioni et al 2021 freshwater is unsuitable for drinking when its chloride concentration is greater than 250 mg l i e exceeding 1 of seawater werner et al 2013 it

2020 zhong and wu 2020 to our knowledge the combined effect of the human derived agricultural non point pollution and swi in the coastal aquifer has attracted relatively limited concerns so far which is also a significant factor for groundwater contamination wallace et al 2020 torres martínez et al 2021 nitrate one of the most bioavailable forms of nitrogen is quite soluble in water and is not

optimization zhang and vesselinov 2017 niu et al 2019 zhang and ren 2021 and agent based modeling hu et al 2017 bieber et al 2018 the simulation optimization s o framework a practical framework for groundwater resources management can explain the complex groundwater flow behaviors and distinguish the optimal management schemes for a set of constraints singh 2015 song et al 2020 yang et al 2021b for example niu et al 2019 combined a multiple linear regression model based on the gsflow simulations with a multi objective linear fractional programming approach to elucidate the synergies and trade offs of the water ecosystem agriculture nexus in zhangye basin this study revealed the impacts of hydrological dynamics land use and water resources management rules on economic ecological and environmental efficiencies zhang and ren 2021 identified seasonal fallow schemes of haihe river basin by the s o framework which combined a modified swat model with linear programming to highlight the role of groundwater resources on the water food energy nexus however the real world groundwater management problems are generally complicated due to the nonlinear and multimodal objectives and constraints to some extent the challenge possibly results in the unavailability of traditional optimization algorithms for this reason the reliability and effectiveness of multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas have been extensively proved in recent years reed et al 2013 maier et al 2019 song et al 2018 2020 jiang et al 2021b yang et al 2021b exploring the complex relationships among the different nexus based on the linked s o framework is desirable but remains challenging on the one hand the wea nexus achieved the limited concerns so far in coastal areas densely populated and supporting marine organisms local agriculture fishery and tourism martínez et al 2007 on the other hand despite previous studies have provided a solid basis for alleviating the extent of swi based on the coastal groundwater management ataie ashtiani and ketabchi 2011 hussain et al 2015 song et al 2018 christelis and mantoglou 2019 yang et al 2021b the coupled s o model that accounts for swi and reactive nitrogen transport process in the coastal aquifer has yet to be quantified for the basin scale research moreover the variable density modeling and reactive nitrogen transport modeling are often highly nonlinear and accompanied by a huge computational burden during the operation the balance of saving computational cost and guaranteeing the accuracy of model prediction always determines the practicality and performance of the basin scale s o framework song et al 2018 yang et al 2021b therefore it is of great importance to integrate surrogate assisted multi objective s o framework for the scientific management of the wea nexus in basin scale coastal regions the dagu river basin drb in qingdao city of western jiaodong peninsula is confronting the challenges derived from water scarcity and environmental degradation the excessive fertilization and tillage and unregulated groundwater abstraction in the drb have caused many environmental issues including np and swi many researches have been accomplished qualitatively or quantitatively evaluating the environmental effects which offered more compelling and deeper insights into the water systems environmental issues and agriculture patterns in the drb zeng et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 jiang et al 2021a yang et al 2021a yin et al 2021 however the full analysis of the complex wea nexus using the multi objective s o framework has not been carried out in the coastal basin the study aims to develop the multi objective s o framework for exploring the alternative cropping strategies subject to the combined influences of swi and np in the s o framework 1 the seawat rt3d model is developed for the first attempt to assess swi and reactive nitrogen transport in the basin scale coastal aquifer and 2 the surrogate assisted multi objective optimization algorithm smoma kelm proposed by song et al 2018 is integrated into the validated numerical simulation model to predict the long term biogeochemical variations and optimize the regional cultivated strategy the multi objective s o model for the wea nexus in the coastal aquifer is devoted to reconciling contradictions between socioeconomic development and environmental preservation consequently maximizing net agricultural benefits and minimizing the extents of swi and np are considered as the management objectives the developed s o framework of the wea nexus is significant in gaining a deep insight into the real world coastal groundwater management problems ranging from quantifying and forecasting the long term hydrological and biogeochemical evolutions of coastal aquifer to achieving the trade offs among social economy water food security and environmental impacts 2 study area 2 1 hydrometeorological and hydrogeological conditions the drb is a typical agriculture dominated coastal basin in qingdao shandong province china and includes laixi county pingdu county jimo county and jiaozhou county encompassing 469 km2 the morphological architecture of the drb is regarded as the coastal plain valley with land elevation up to 45 m above sea level the study area exhibits warm monsoon continental and oceanic climate with an average annual temperature and potential evapotranspiration of 12 3 c and 983 9 mm respectively yin et al 2021 the mean precipitation rate is 678 7 mm during 1952 2020 with relatively nonuniform rates throughout the year most rainfall occurs between june and september rainy season accounting for almost 73 of the annual precipitation the basin comprises the dagu river the xiaogu river the wugu river and the liuhao river fig 1 the dagu river is the largest river with a total length of 179 9 km however the dagu river is an ephemeral river and its flow is frequently cut off because of insufficient runoff replenishment caused by climate change and anthropogenic interferences zhang et al 2020 due to the scarcity of surface water resources and the prohibitive cost 4 7 cny m3 cny stands for chinese yuan of seawater desalinization national research council 2008 zheng et al 2014 groundwater is the primary source for agricultural irrigation industry and domestic uses in the basin the increasing water demand and unregulated groundwater abstraction elevate the risks of swi near pumping wells in recent decades the balance between seawater and fresh water in the coastal aquifer has been broken leading to swi northward rapidly to alleviate the extent of swi a sequence of water conservancy projects such as subsurface dam forming groundwater reservoirs and river dams preventing river runoff discharge are constructed zhang et al 2020 on the other hand the excess use of chemical fertilizers and unreasonable irrigation practices have caused considerable nitrate loading and groundwater contamination in the irrigation districts therefore decision makers are firmly concerned with balancing the potential of groundwater abstraction and np derived from agricultural development in the central valley the aquifer consists of unconsolidated alluvial deposits i e sand gravel and clay the upper aquifer unit is formed by low permeable clayey sand and sandy clay with a thickness of 2 5 m the lower aquifer unit is formed by thick sand and gravel showing greater capacity of groundwater supply these aquifer units defined as an unconfined aquifer system with a thickness of approximately 10 20 m are the primary water supply zones besides the bottom of aquifer is constrained with cretaceous sandstone and shale bedrock as a no flow boundary yang et al 2021a 2 2 land use and agricultural practices agriculture is a crucial sector of the local economy that contributes 3 6 1010 cny yr to the gross domestic product gdp and employs 35 of the available rural workforce in qingdao city in recent decades crop yields have risen significantly increasing from 8 79 109 kg yr in 2001 to 9 29 109 kg yr in 2019 qingdao municipal statistics bureau 2020 the cultivable land residential and commercial area forest land grassland paddy field water body and unused land are the main land use types of the drb which are derived from the us landsat satellite remote sensing images with a resolution of 30 m in 2015 as shown in fig 2 furthermore the eight sub categories of cultivable land i e winter wheat summer maize ww sm winter garlic onion summer green onion wg o sgo ginger taro g t potato green onion cabbage p go c tomato cucumber t c greenhouse tomato cucumber t c winter garlic onion summer maize wg o sm and carrot carrot radish c c r are defined by the farmer s field survey and on site visits yang et al 2021a the vegetable plantations or water liking crops are primarily distributed along the riverbank where is convenient for agricultural irrigation in contrast the grain plantations ww and sm are located near the aquifer boundary or urbanized areas there are two crop growing periods wet monsoon season june september and normal dry season october may some crops are also grown in other periods depending on their growing habits water availability and local cultivation tradition the detailed spatial distribution and rotation schedules of different planting patterns in the drb are depicted in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively 3 methodology in this study the conjunctive s o framework translates the interlinkages between the wea nexus into a series of related mathematical formulations it incorporates the surrogate assisted multi objective s o framework with the calibrated seawat rt3d model to optimize the cropping areas and evaluate the effects of agricultural practices on the basin scale hydro economic and environmental developments the stages for solving the s o model can be summarized as follows stage 1 developing a numerical model to simulate the temporal evolutions and spatial distributions of variable density groundwater flow and salinity using seawat code to determine the areas of swi then the calibrated model is linked to the rt3d model to simulate reactive nitrogen transport subject to swi finally the well calibrated model can be employed to construct the kelm model in stage 2 and combined with the management model for solving the pareto optimal front in stage 3 stage 2 building kelm surrogate model it is regarded as an approximate simulator to generate the patterns of variable density groundwater flow and reactive nitrogen transport in coastal aquifers and reduce a substantial computational burden in the next stage the kelm model is trained adaptively to satisfy the desired fidelity level to reduce the prediction error accumulation of state variables and converge to the pareto optimal front the distinct advantages and mathematical expressions of kelm are presented in section s2 for the details of the theory configuration fig s1 applications and trends of kelm the readers can also refer to huang et al 2006 2012 and huang et al 2015 stage 3 establishing the wea nexus management model smoma kelm searches the pareto optimal solutions between three objectives subject to the water and food supply security and land availability finally the typical trade off schemes are selected to evaluate optimal agriculture practices economic and environmental benefits while the visual analytics tool is used to achieve the full analysis of the pareto front fig 4 introduces a typical wea nexus in the drb and the flowchart of the multi objective s o framework numerical modeling and the optimization algorithm used in the study are presented in the following sections moreover to clearly present the s o framework a list of notations is shown in table s1 3 1 numerical simulation modeling in this study numerical modeling is organized in two phases transient variable density groundwater flow and salt transport are first simulated by seawat to identify the hydrological flow patterns and salinity transport behaviors in the coastal aquifer the groundwater flow field and the heterogeneous distributions of chloride obtained from seawat are then coupled to a reactive transport model based on rt3d to simulate nitrogen reactions such as nitrification denitrification and so on reflecting the impacts of agricultural practices on coastal groundwater the general mathematical equation describing variable density groundwater flow is expressed as eq 1 guo and langevin 2002 the fate and transport of aqueous and solid phase species in saturated porous media can be stated as eq 2 and eq 3 respectively clement 1997 1 x i ρ k f i h f x i ρ ρ f ρ f z x i ρ s q s ρ s f h f t θ ρ c c t 2 x

the variable density numerical simulation model in this study is modified from our previous work of zhang et al 2020 using seawat a finite difference grid with dimensions of 150 m by 150 m is considered and it is discretized to 418 rows 189 columns and a single layer despite the spatial discretization is a little coarse it is determined by the need of simplifying the scientific calculations to balance computational efficiency and numerical accuracy the simulation period extends from january 2001 to december 2016 and each month is taken as a stress period it is marked in fig 1 and fig 2 that the northern eastern and western boundaries are all treated as no flow and no mass flux boundaries while the southern boundary is set to a general head boundary ghb and specified concentration boundary to simulate the interactions between groundwater and seawater in the coastal aquifer ghb the simplest head dependent flux boundary is different from the constant head and constant flux boundary it can characterize the hydraulic response of the boundaries to the groundwater condition variations harbaugh 2005 lu et al 2015 the referencing heads vary from 1 m to 1 m and the hydraulic conductance is 1000 m2 d besides the range of specified chloride concentrations is between 1350 mg l and 5048 mg l while nitrate is 5 15 mg l the subsurface dam with the top elevation of 0 m above sea level is adjacent to the southern boundary of the model domain and the dam s bottom is embedded into the bedrock in the numerical model the hydraulic conductivity of the cells occupied by the subsurface dam is set to 0 0001 m d to reflect its barrier effect on swi moreover the hydraulic connection on both sides of the subsurface dam occurs only if groundwater levels exceed 0 m so that it plays an essential role in mitigating the swi trend the precipitation infiltration irrigation potential evapotranspiration et groundwater abstraction and interactions with the dagu river are the crucial factors governing water resources in the drb the evapotranspiration evt1 package in modflow is utilized to simulate et from the phreatic surface determined by the extinct depth the potential et is equal to the maximum et rate when the water table is higher than the specified surface otherwise it is equal to 0 the various crop s irrigation quota determines the groundwater demand for agricultural irrigation furthermore the allocation of irrigation periods depends on their growing habits and local cultivation tradition hence the return flow of irrigation from agricultural areas is indispensable in the simulation model the dagu river is simulated by the river riv1 package which can model the interactions between rivers and underlying aquifers based on river levels and the hydraulic conductivity 5 m d of riverbed the calibrated process of transient state simulation includes some manual adjustments for hydraulic conductivity specific yield and longitudinal dispersivity by the trial and error technique to achieve a good fit between observed and calculated groundwater levels and reproduce the spatial temporal evolution of swi table 1 presents the physical and hydraulic parameter values calibrated in the study the accuracy of the numerical model is evaluated using root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r the criteria can also be used to estimate the performance of solute transport and the approximation of surrogate model the mathematical formulations are stated as follows 4 rmse v 1 v s v o v 2 v 5 r v 1 v o v o s v s v 1 v o v o 2 v 1 v s v s 2 where v is the total number of samples sv and ov are the simulated and observed groundwater level or solute concentration of the vth sample respectively s and o are the mean value of simulated and observed data respectively during the kelm training and testing processes sv and ov are the predicted value of surrogate model and the exact value of numerical simulation model for the vth sample respectively and s and o are the average value of the predicted and exact values respectively in phase i the groundwater flow field and the spatial distributions of chloride are obtained then the variable density model is coupled with a reactive transport model in phase ii the corresponding nitrogen reactions and additional reactive solutes nh4 no2 no3 n2 doc o2 and three microbes are introduced 3 1 2 phase ii reactive nitrogen transport model rt3d includes a broad range of solution algorithms to deal with the reactive process for the multi species solute transport based on kinetic rate equations lee et al 2006 put forward a nitrogen transformation module for rt3d that accounts for ammonium oxidation nitrification denitrification organic carbon oxidation and microbial reactions which reveals the fate and transport of nh4 no2 no3 n2 doc and o2 eqs 6 9 depict the primary reactions moreover the reaction rates reaction kinetics equations ordinary differential equations based on operator split strategy and biomass growth rate are all elucidated in section s3 chemical and kinetic parameter values used in the rt3d model are provided in table 1 6 n h 4 1 5 o 2 aq n o 2 2 h h 2 o

especially for the rapid agricultural development hansen et al 2017 therefore it is essential to quantify the amount of nitrogen loss and its contribution to hydrologic components across the drb the nl kg n ha yr in the study is calculated by the empirical equation pratt 1984 10 nl 0 20 n i d 0 712 where ni is the nitrogen fertilizer input kg ha yr and d is the drainage cm yr which is evaluated by the total infiltration recharge such as precipitation and irrigation return recharge yang et al 2021a for the entire 16 years the estimated nl value is with an average of 1 74 107 kg n yr 3 2 multi objective simulation optimization modeling 3 2 1 surrogate assisted multi objective optimization algorithm song et al 2018 optimized the groundwater abstraction strategies in large scale coastal aquifers by a novel smoma kelm model which is flexible to accommodate diverse objective functions and constraints targeting specified problems as illustrated in fig 4 the main steps of the smoma kelm are 1 generating an initial random population of crops planting areas using latin hypercube sampling lhs and then training the preliminary kelm model and then running the surrogate model to evaluate offspring individuals for alleviating the huge computational burden 2 selecting promising individuals accounting for 20 of population size from the approximate pareto solutions using hypervolume hv improvement and the crowding distance metrics at intervals of several generations 3 using the gaussian disturbance to find an promising candidate solution to enhance the local optimality of the offspring individuals 4 implementing adaptive training strategy i e re evaluating the promising pareto solutions utilizing seawat rt3d model and then re training the kelm model to improve the prediction accuracy of pareto optimal solution and 5 comparing all individuals stored in the archived solutions evaluated by the numerical model and then obtain final pareto optimal solutions finally a visual analytics package discoverydv is used to explore and analyze wea nexus management in multi dimensional objective spaces which can assist multi stakeholders and decision makers across sectors to select key trade off schemes based on various criteria or concerns the parameters required by the algorithm are summarized in table 2 in summary the smoma kelm achieves the capacity of the highly effective global search for pareto optimal front while finding high quality and diverse solutions using the local search operators it is noteworthy that the optimization algorithm saves a huge computational burden especially for basin scale swi and np s o model 3 2 2 wea nexus management model surrogate assisted multi objective s o framework is utilized to solve the wea nexus management model for sustainable agriculture development in the coastal region which is desired in reconciling contradictions between socioeconomic and environmental developments hence the management objectives include the maximization of the net agricultural benefits and minimization of the extents of swi and np the management period is set to 15 years to investigate the optimal plantation areas of crops in the drb reflecting the long term planning process of cropping pattern while considering the water and food supply security and land availability the objective functions and constraints are described as follows the economic objective the first objective f nab is denoted as the maximum net agricultural benefits in the drb showing the economic benefits of the agricultural system and it can be stated as 11 max f nab p 1 p s 1 s p c p s y p s a p s p 1 p s 1 s c c p s a p s where p represents the crop index p 1 for ww sm p 2 for wg o sm p 3 for wg o sgo p 4 for p go c p 5 for c c r p 6 for g t p 7 for t c and p 8 for t c p is the total number of crops s indicates the id of 15 sub districts as shown in fig 5 s is the total number of sub districts pcp s is the market price of pth crop in the sth sub region cny kg yp s is the yield of pth crop in the sth sub region kg ha ap s is the total planting area of pth crop in the sth sub region ha i e the sole decision variables ccp s is the total farming cost of pth crop in the sth sub region which contains seed fertilizer application land and labor expenses cny ha the environmental objectives as mentioned above the main environmental problems in the drb include 1 swi triggered by the unregulated pumping activities and 2 agricultural non point source pollutants from nl caused by the application of chemical fertilizers therefore the second objective f esi is to minimize the extent of swi and the third objective function f enp is to minimize the extent of np the extents of swi and np are evaluated by the maximum limit levels based on the standard for drinking water and the limit of salinity is 250 mg l while nitrate is 10 mg l the f esi and f enp can be stated as 12 min f esi t 1 t i 1 k c con c cl t k c if con c cl 250 mg l 13 min f enp t 1 t j 1 k n con c n o 3 t k n if con c n o 3 10 mg l where conccl represents the concentration of cl mg l and kc means the total number of cells where the conccl 250 mg l at the last year of the management period in the same way concno3 and kn indicate the concentration of no3 mg l and the total number of cells where the concno3 10 mg l at the last year of the management period respectively and t is the final year of the management period that consists of 12 stress periods the constraints of water security 14 q p s min q p s q p s max p 1 2 p s 1 2 s where p represents the crop index p 1

groundwater abstraction in the sub districts which must be within the specified lower and upper bounds qp s min qp s max to guarantee the local water security the parameters for different crops management are displayed in table 3 the constraints of food security and land availability 15 1 r a p s ini a p s a p s ini p 1 2 p s 1 2 s where p represents the crop index p 1 for ww sm p 2 for wg o

p s i n i is the initial tillable area of pth crop in the sth sub region ha r is the acceptable maximum reduction ratio of agricultural land which is set to be 30 in our study the adjusted agricultural land could turn into fallow or residential and commercial areas furthermore the reduced irrigation water demand is favorable to satisfy the water saving goal to supply enough water resources for the local eco environmental system meanwhile it is an effective strategy to avoid water scarcity on the other hand transferring the agricultural irrigation rate to urban and industrial uses could achieve higher economic benefits 4 results and analysis 4 1 seawat rt3d simulation results fig 6 a presents a comparison between the calibrated and observed groundwater levels over time in three typical monitoring wells which suggests that the long term seasonal fluctuation of groundwater levels can be accomplished based on the simulation model moreover the simulated groundwater levels fit well with observed groundwater levels at all observation wells over the simulation period with an rmse of 0 82 m and r of 0 997 fig 6b the spatial distributions of the flow field and chloride field at the end of the simulation period are presented in fig 7 the groundwater levels decrease from the piedmont to the southern boundary fig 7a and the simulated chloride concentrations range from 0 mg l to 5048 mg l fig 7b the upper and middle reaches are far away from the shoreline so that the initial chloride concentration derived from swi is equal to 0 mg l the swi region is separated into two sub regions the intruded zones with chloride values 250 mg l are mainly located either in the nearshore area or in the northern saltwater residual area where the depression cones of groundwater flow are formed in the historical period due to unconstrained groundwater abstraction the total encroachment area decreases from 70 km2 in 1998 zhang et al 2020 to 57 km2 in 2016 due to the construction of the subsurface dam and the reduction of groundwater abstraction however these results from our study also show that the residual saltwater zone in the aquifer is very difficult to clean up thoroughly which may be attributed to the aquifer heterogeneity and subsurface dam preventing the natural submarine groundwater discharge yang et al 2021b indicated that the swi zone in turn can be considered as the potential effective recharge area for artificial injection in displacing seawater therefore they proposed a conjunctive management model for simultaneously developing optimal design of pumping and injection strategies which is pragmatic to mitigate the extent of swi in terms of np fig 8 a exhibits the simulated and observed nitrate concentrations at three groundwater monitoring locations over time the results combined with fig 8b indicate that the reactive model captures the within season and long term evolution processes of nitrate with an rmse of 17 61 mg l and r of 0 768 for all observation wells of groundwater quality the w04 w08 and w23 are in the c c r g t and p go c sub region respectively the seasonal pattern of nitrate is characterized by increase in the sowing and growing periods due to the utilization of fertilization and decline in the harvesting periods contributing to denitrification and negligible nl both box plot fig 8c and the solute field fig 8d manifest that the nitrate concentrations in the upper and middle reaches are higher than the observations in the lower reaches the reason for the phenomena is that the vegetable plantations are ubiquitous in the northern areas while the residential and commercial areas occupy the southern regions moreover the southern sub districts of the aquifer are mainly cultivated with ww sm indicating that the nitrate mass loading is limited the concentration hot spots close to the model boundary demonstrate the slower circulation and more prolonged nitrate accumulation these results are in good agreement with yang et al 2021a the well calibrated seawat rt3d model can be used to calculate the objectives and constraints of the management model under the s o framework and consider the wea nexus 4 2 kelm emulation results in section 4 1 the seawat rt3d model accurately describes the spatial temporal evolutions of swi and np in the drb evaluation of a single scheme with a high fidelity numerical simulation model takes about 5 min on a desktop pc equipped with a 3 80 ghz intel i7 processor and 16 gb of ram before using the smoma kelm it needs to call the seawat rt3d model 20600 times in the s o framework and the total runtime is about 1717 h however the smoma kelm employing surrogate model requires only about 50 h for the performance of 600 numerical simulation runs for initial training and testing besides 1000 high fidelity model runs by the evolutionary search for adaptive training of kelm model during the wea nexus management need approximately 84 h therefore the lower fidelity kelm as the surrogate model is used to replace the original seawat rt3d model to reduce the computational burden in the optimization the lhs generates 500 samples from planting areas to train kelm surrogate model moreover another 100 patterns of cropping are randomly generated to quantify the capability of kelm in capturing the interrelation between state variables i e cl and no3 concentrations reflecting the state of seawat rt3d model and decision variables i e planting areas representing the specific strategy of wea nexus management model rmse and r are used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the developed kelm model as shown in table 4 the predicted concentrations of cl and no3 based on training and testing surrogate model have good agreements with those results obtained from the seawat rt3d simulation model this result demonstrates that the kelm model a computationally efficient approximate model has the advantage of reproducing the nonlinear behaviors during swi and reactive nitrogen transport processes it can substitute for the seawat rt3d model in the s o framework furthermore to improve the accuracy of kelm model in the optimization process the smoma kelm algorithm will re train the surrogate model based on re evaluated optimal local individuals by the seawat rt3d model to improve the prediction accuracy of pareto optimal solutions the adaptive training strategy for kelm model guides the evolutionary search towards the region composed of optimal solutions song et al 2018 4 3 optimization results 4 3 1 pareto optimal solutions a multi objective s o framework is used to deal with the wea nexus management model consisting of three objectives f nab f esi and f enp to search for optimal planting schemes the improvements in one objective can only be accomplished by degrading performance in the remaining objectives due to the conflicts existed in the wea nexus hence an optimal set of non inferior decision variables constitutes what is termed the non dominated or pareto optimal set reflecting the conflicts or trade offs among f nab f esi and f enp the 484 pareto optimal solutions are identified as equally good unless the preferences of decision makers have been identified fig 9 a shows a global view of the trade off surface in the four dimensional 4d coordinate plot the f enp f esi and f nab are plotted on the x y and z axes respectively meanwhile the total groundwater irrigation rate f tgi depicted with color is added to compare the nexus of water environment and agriculture the navy blue arrow indicates the preferred direction for each objective it is shown that the trade off relationship exists between the wea nexus system enlarging the cultivation areas of diverse crops increases the net agricultural profits with the solutions marked in red but it simultaneously requires more agricultural water demands which is the predominant factor for nl into underlying coastal aquifers and seawater intruding into freshwater zones it might be challenging to explore the trade off surface for this reason the parallel coordinates are used to elucidate the discrepancy of pareto optimal solutions as illustrated in fig 9b parallel coordinates include four equal distance parallel axes representing the three dimensional 3d objective vectors and the f tgi all pareto optimal solutions cover a range of 2 82 f nab 3 49 109 cny yr 1429 55 f esi 1470 54 mg l 34 45 f enp 39 35 mg l and 7 18 f tgi 8 69 107 m3 yr in fig 9b many slope segments exist between f nab and f enp as well as f esi and f tgi suggesting obvious trade offs for the wea nexus consequently basin scale cropping patterns conflict with the socioeconomic and environmental interests in the drb the present irrigable area of 15 sub districts ids 1 15 is about 3 06 104 ha accounting for 65 of the drb given that the recurring drought periods and long term shortages of runoff replenishment into the aquifer have become bottlenecks restricting the development of the drb the climate background is set as a consecutive normal year with the precipitation is about 574 mm and the river levels decreasing from the piedmont 42 m to the southern boundary 2 m during the management period to explore the optimal cultivation scheme besides the groundwater irrigation rate in different cropping sub regions is calculated by the irrigation quota presented in table 3 however the present cropping strategy depletes groundwater storage for the normal year therefore the maximum total planting area i e the maximum area of well irrigation is set at approximately 2 65 104 ha to avoid the groundwater scarcity of the coastal aquifer the maximum cultivation scheme is marked with the square green box in fig 9a and a dark blue straight line in fig 9b respectively this scheme shows a relatively higher net profit and greater average chloride and nitrate concentrations simultaneously to some extent the present planting scheme and the maximum cropping area used in the study are both sub optimal which should be adjusted to obtain synergies from the wea nexus the optimized management schemes play crucial roles in avoiding cognitive myopia between different sectors moreover the compromise scheme achieving a higher net agricultural benefit with more minor negative impacts in the non dominated set should be favored in the process of decision making in addition all objective values are normalized to dimensionless values between 0 and 1 and the reference point is set to the objective vector 1 1 1 to evaluate the hv indicator of approximate pareto solutions which is a general metric to indicate the convergence of multi objective evolutionary search fig 10 depicts the variations of the hv metric over the number of generations that are slightly slower during earlier generations but it accelerates the convergence during the middle generations as illustrated in fig 10 the pareto front gradually improves and achieves a steady hv value at the final stage without sacrificing the accuracy of pareto optimal solutions the excellent search performance of smoma kelm benefits from the adaptive strategy that improves the precision of kelm model and the local search that enhances the capability of exploration over the objective space 4 3 2 optimized management schemes the decision makers can firstly investigate the performance of non dominated solutions in the lower order objective space and then examine the trade off solutions based on the previous analysis in the 3d space to satisfy the multi stakeholders preferences and generate synergies across all sectors fig 11 delineates the projections of three objective pareto solutions into two dimensional 2d space the navy blue arrow indicates the preferred direction for each objective the pareto front in the f nab and f enp objective space contains 125 solutions where the increasing rate of f enp is slower when f nab 3 30 109 cny yr subsequently the enhancing trend of f enp is visible fig 11a solutions 1 3 are the pareto optimal solutions in the non dominated front in the f nab and f enp sub problem which may be selected by decision makers with preference as illustrated in fig 11b the pareto front corresponded to the trade off between f nab and f esi is composed of 24 pareto optimal solutions in which the extent of swi promptly exacerbates from 1429 55 mg l to 1454 68 mg l with the net farming incomes raising from 3 40 109 cny yr to 3 49 109 cny yr however it can be noted that solutions 1 3 exhibit worse performance in the f nab and f esi objective space which implies that multi objective trade offs could help reduce the decision bias that occurs in low dimensional optimization problems thus it is crucial for the decision makers to identify the accurate compromise solution which performs well in the three objectives space simultaneously in this study four specific solutions are selected to interpret the impacts on the wea nexus compared to the maximum cultivation scheme solution 8 table 5 exhibits the objective values of the selected pareto solutions in comparison with the optimization results obtained from fig 9 and fig 11 solution 4 corresponds to the compromise solution in the 3d objective space which can be selected by decision makers with no preference for management objectives solution 5 has the most considerable objective value of f nab in the pareto front satisfying the constraints of water food security and land availability moreover solution 6 with a minimum value of f enp and solution 7 with a minimum value of f esi represent the optimal performance in conserving local groundwater quality respectively solution 6 and solution 8 are located at the top and bottom end of the second axis of parallel coordinates respectively and the difference in nitrate concentration is about 5 10 mg l solution 7 can minimize the extent of swi and achieve a relatively lower concentration of nitrate which is second only to solution 6 among the selected solutions in comparison with solution 8 although the f nab of the other four solutions have declined to various degrees the environmental objectives f enp and f esi have been improved and the risk of groundwater scarcity in coastal aquifers has been alleviated simultaneously fig 12 shows the discrepancy of solutions 4 8 in cultivation areas and the δirrigation δirrigation is the difference between f tgi s4 s5 s6 s7 and f tgi s8 of the respective out of 15 cropping sub districts solution 4 shows that the cultivation areas except for id 3 id 9 id 11 and id 15 should decrease compared with solution 8 while the areas of id 5 and ids 12 14 should be reduced to the minimal planting areas the compromise strategy achieves a relatively higher f nab and lower concentrations of f enp and f esi which can save about 0 76 107 m3 yr of irrigation water solution 5 which is very similar to solution 8 exhibits that grain rotations i e the cultivation of ww sm and vegetable grain rotation i e the cultivation of wg o sm should be diminished to obtain more net agricultural benefits the grains net profits are relatively lower than high value vegetables especially those with multiple harvests this solution will be the most desired solution for stakeholders in the agricultural sector from the socioeconomic perspective however the sustainable food supply in the future might be questionable it is acknowledged that food imports alone are far from sustaining the huge food demands not to mention the basic staple foods wheat and maize in china furthermore in the light of the importance of planting diversity the crop area of grains should also be guaranteed instead of blindly pursuing higher agricultural economic benefits solution 6 the minimization of f enp objective is aimed at alleviating the impacts of np in the coastal aquifer which shows the planting areas of all 15 sub districts should be reduced moreover the ideal scheme with the minimal f esi solution 7 illustrates that the reduction of cultivation area in the drb except for id 1 id 3 and id 15 zones is essential it can be noted that the chloride concentration of the solution 7 is similar to that in the 3d compromise solution solution 4 which demonstrates that adjusting the planting patterns is a practical strategy to alleviate the extent of swi especially for the sub districts close to swi zones or with relatively larger cropping area moreover a large amount of groundwater can be saved using solution 6 and solution 7 1 63 107 m3 yr and 1 17 107 m3 yr respectively in comparison to solution 8 which is favorable to satisfy the water saving goal to supply enough water resources for the local eco environmental system therefore the optimization results obtained from our study can provide the candidate schemes for the multi stakeholders across sectors of the wea nexus in the drb furthermore the one factor at a time oat sensitivity analysis is employed to examine the response relationships between f enp and the corresponding chemical and kinetic parameters through increasing and decreasing their calibrated values by 10 the results presented in fig s2 suggest that the maximum substrate utilization rates in the specific process the half saturation constant of doc and the microbial yield coeffificients and death or maintenance rate constants of bacteria are the primary governing factors on the reactive nitrogen transport process as shown in fig 13 and fig 14 the seasonal and zonal variations of the average nitrate concentrations at the last year of the management period are depicted to exhibit the pareto optimal solutions from the proposed multi objective s o framework it can be illustrated in fig 13 that the average nitrate concentrations before optimization fluctuate from 41 22 mg l to 42 28 mg l and the extent of np is obviously alleviated after optimization the concentrations of solution 5 and solution 8 are higher than that of the compromise solution and the solutions with minimum environmental negative impacts the nitrate seasonal evolution of the selected solutions is characterized by increase in the sowing and growing periods and decrease in the harvesting periods under the same climate background the larger the planting area is the more the chemical fertilizers are applied correspondingly it would increase the pressure for the underlying aquifers due to the significant amount of nl the coastal aquifer is more vulnerable to np when the cropping schemes are unsuitable for the preservation of groundwater resources regarding the spatial distributions of np the sub regions with high nitrate concentrations especially the wg o sgo sub region id 5 g t sub region id 7 and t c sub region id 11 are mainly located in the upper and middle reaches the applications of chemical fertilizers are approximately 1503 kg n ha yr 1199 kg n ha yr and 1080 kg n ha yr for the above three vegetables rotation areas respectively the extensive nitrogen loading from agricultural practices and the intensive vertical water exchange trigger the immense nl into the underlying aquifers moreover the reduced nitrate s residence time in the unsaturated zone is unfavorable to crop uptake and nitrogen natural attenuation the average nitrate concentrations are generally smaller than 30 mg l in the lower reaches cultivated with ww sm which may be attributed to the limited requirements of chemical fertilizers for the grains and the less amount of nl ascribed to the insufficient precipitation recharge and irrigation return recharge in some clay areas it can be seen in fig 14 that the selected pareto optimal solutions solution 4 and solution 6 have the advantage in mitigating the extent of np within the high value crops planting sub districts however the extent of np within the southern grains plantations is barely affected by the optimal cultivation schemes the phenomenon may be the consequence of the hydrological processes the contaminant plume gradually transports from northern vegetable cultivated sub districts to southern grain cultivated sub districts at the end of the management period in the maximum planting scenario solution 8 the highest nitrate concentrations of ids 13 15 sub districts are all greater than that of solution 4 and solution 6 however the average nitrate concentrations of the two solutions are lower than solution 8 which may be the results of the evaluation method based on average values moreover the reactive transport of nitrate is complex and comprehensively affected by biogeochemical transport agricultural activities and other endogenous and exogenous stresses the spatial temporal variations of np and the primary governing factors in different cropping sub districts need to be further explored to confirm our preliminary analysis above 5 discussion the optimization analysis of planting patterns under the context of wea nexus could gain the decision information on trade offs of social economic development water and food supply security and environmental health and then achieve a transition to sustainability the s o framework used in the study permits decision makers or stakeholders to visualize the nexus outcomes in general decision makers in the different sectors seek different development goals for the water resources system hydrologists and decision makers have long devoted themselves to managing trade offs of water demand versus water supply water quality versus water quantity beneficiaries in the upper reaches versus beneficiaries in the lower reaches and environmental impacts versus economic benefits cai et al 2018 in the context of the wea nexus these trade offs will become increasingly complex because more and more sub sectors and stakeholders are involved therefore our study results will play vital roles in reallocating groundwater resources for agricultural irrigation which further affects food supply nl and swi in the coastal aquifer of drb in the semi arid coastal areas the shortages of precipitation recharge and the replenishment of river runoff due to the dam in the upper reaches induce that adjusting the planting patterns is an effective strategy to allocate the irrigation water demand while considering the food supply and environmental risks the proposed wea nexus management model implements the optimization of planting patterns by setting the objectives and constraints to guarantee food security over the management period the current groundwater irrigation rate is about 1 09 108 m3 yr while the optimal cropping schemes can reduce the irrigation supply by approximately 2 21 107 m3 yr to 3 72 107 m3 yr the groundwater resources in the upper and middle reaches are characterized by higher nitrate concentrations and lower chloride concentrations and vice versa in the lower reaches from the perspective of water cycle or reuse the nitrogen mass accumulated over decades in the drb could be regarded as valuable nutrient resources for crops to improve water use efficiencies and reduce the application of chemical fertilizers as a marginal water resource the saline groundwater can be applied to irrigating high value crops after desalination moreover in order to meet the increasing requirement of irrigation water appropriate water allocation and non conventional water resource management should be incorporated into the wea nexus such as rainfall stormwater runoff cooling water hydraulic fracturing wastewater process wastewater from pulp paper and food industries and domestic sewage as discussed by chen et al 2021 for the environmental system the decision makers pay more attention to alleviating the environmental deterioration caused by the multiple stresses the decline of some crops areas such as ww sm and p go c cultivations close to the swi zones is essential for relieving the seawater encroachment the extent of swi is sensitive to the variations of the cultivation areas in ids 12 15 as shown in fig s3 the enlargement of the four sub districts planting areas could lead to more severe environmental degradation for the extent of np the changes of nitrate concentrations are most obvious in the id 5 wg o sgo sub district accounting for the largest planting area among all cultivable types producing enormous nl into the underlying coastal aquifers moreover it is noteworthy that the mean values of nitrate concentrations in the respective 15 cropping sub districts are all greater than 10 mg l despite implementing the wea nexus optimization management which reflects that lowering the levels of the groundwater contamination to the drinking water standard is very difficult for regional nitrate contaminated aquifers in productive agriculture centered areas hansen et al 2017 have noted that in some parts of the western world the enhanced nitrogen management has significantly alleviated the np in groundwater systems although it often still does not meet groundwater and drinking water standards in all areas hence it is necessary to take some additional measurements to alleviate the extent of np based on the reasonable planting schemes formulated by pareto optimal solutions for example the slow releasing fertilizer is a practical alternative with equal nutrient supplies and less nitrogen mass loss applying this fertilizer can lower about 36 of chemical fertilizer usage yang et al 2021a in addition water saving irrigation systems like sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation are required to mitigate the vertical water exchange and reduce nl for the agricultural system the stakeholders usually focus on crop yields boosting economic development and ensuring food supply as mentioned above swi is sensitive to the variations of the ids 12 15 sub districts however wheat and maize are the basic staple foods in china and the yield will be sacrificed completely once the planting areas of ww sm are reduced to alleviate the extent of swi to deal with this problem rice could be an alternative crop to attain multi dimensional benefits alleviate the extent of swi and balance soil salinity on the other hand reasonable fallow patterns and rain fed schemes are crucial for the sustainability of groundwater irrigation in the wea nexus i e replacing the traditional ww sm double cropping with sm single cropping in the successive years and implementing rain fed during the sm growing season zhang and ren 2021 it is noteworthy that the cultivation areas cannot easily increase because the crops would take years to grow and then become fully productive furthermore once the land use type is turned into the residential and commercial areas during the urbanization process it would be irreversible for the short term development therefore in order to avoid cognitive myopia between the different sectors the stakeholders should make holistic decisions considering the interdependence of the wea nexus the compromise scheme solution 4 should be favored in the study because it can achieve a higher net agricultural benefit with more minor negative impacts during the management and governance process a highly isolated policy draft without considering the cross sectoral interactions and externalities would create sub optimal solutions and result in unexpected consequences e g water scarcity food crises and environmental degradation making integrating and implementing policies in the nexus paradigm is and will continue to be a challenging task so that it is of great significance to fulfill the knowledge gaps in the nexus which can be summarized as follows 1 there is no blueprint for overcoming institutional disconnect between sectors e g water food and environment are generally regulated by separate administrations markets and engineering infrastructure and even blue and green water are divided into different departments 2 there is no consensus on what degree can higher availability of one resource sustainably relieve the scarcity of another and how might this work at different spatial and temporal scales hoff 2011 cai et al 2018 and 3 there is no standard or harmonized framework that could be utilized to explore the trade offs and potential synergies between various nexus systems due to different governance rules around the world central planning means that economic decisions concerning the manufacturing and the distribution of products are made by the central authority i e government it is different from the free market in which such decisions are generally made by businesses and consumers given that food security and hydro environmental health are always neglected by markets it is imperative for governments of regions and nations to implement regulation and unified action to reduce the negative externalities across sectors moreover the nexus approach emphasis the linkage of government and market mechanism in which comprehensive optimization management with inclusive multi stakeholders bottom up negotiation and participation across sectors are implemented chances are that the transition to sustainability will be achieved if the wea nexus is addressed coherently across all spatial temporal scales in the forms of multi level governance with differentiated but clearly defined responsibilities of sectors hoff 2011 this study attempts to develop a conjunctive s o framework to explore the complex interrelationships of the wea nexus in the semi arid coastal aquifer the pareto optimal solutions generated by the multi objective s o model are more realistic and pragmatic which play crucial roles in making holistic decisions and reconciling contradictions between socioeconomic and environmental developments in general the developed multi objective s o model in the study is universal it can be applied in most coastal areas with highly developed agriculture when 1 the resources e g groundwater supply and farmland availability are limited and it is indispensable to reallocate them sustainably to enhance the synergies across sectors and 2 the environmental degradation has been restricting the development of the region and it is crucial to mitigate the pollution to diminish trade offs between social economy and environment the wea nexus management model in the study provides the most fundamental objectives and constraints in addressing the above problems there is no need to adjust the structure of the s o framework because it is flexible to perfect the objective functions and constraints targeting additional problems for example if the decision makers in the wea nexus pay more attention to food supply demand or water quality improvement i e restrict the groundwater concentrations within the maximum permissible limits in that case the corresponding constraints could be added to the original s o model easily the evolution of groundwater quality and the fluctuation of net agricultural benefits are diverse within different planting schemes for this reason the full analysis of the pareto front based on the visual analytics tool is of great importance to real world applications and policy formulations furthermore the surrogate assisted multi objective s o framework is applicable for decision makers to determine their desired wea nexus management schemes with preferred objectives and achieve minimal environmental impacts and maximal economic profits simultaneously nexus thinking desired a shift from single focus on a certain sub sector to cross sectoral focus on the wea nexus system is the kernel in the study the nexus has emerged as a pragmatic concept to reproduce the complicated and interdependent nature of the wea systems on which people depend to achieve various social economic and hydro environmental goals in practical terms it provides a deeper insight for systematically analyzing the interactions between natural ecosystems and anthropogenic activities the new paradigm plays a vital role in enhancing full system efficiencies generating synergies diminishing trade offs and implementing more integrated cost effective and environment friendly planning or decision making moreover the pareto optimal solutions generated by the multi objective s o model have an advantage in avoiding the decision bias that may often lead to cognitive myopia caused by the low dimensional objectives 6 conclusions in the semi arid coastal regions water security cannot be separated from food security because the food production demands make the agriculture sector the primary water consumer furthermore water and agricultural policies are firmly combined with environmental guidelines any degradation in water quality leads to a decline in agricultural security and an increase of ecological vulnerability and that degree of nexus needs to be explored to ensure overall coherence for this purpose this study develops a multi objective s o model by integrating a basin scale numerical simulation model seawat rt3d with an optimization algorithm smoma kelm the framework intrinsically linked water environment and agriculture sectors in the real world is successfully applied to the drb a typical swi region with intensive agricultural irrigation in china the well calibrated simulation model reasonably describes the spatial temporal evolutions of swi and np in the drb from 2001 to 2016 moreover to reduce the computational burden and improve the accuracy of pareto optimal solutions the smoma kelm is utilized to search the optimal cropping patterns for the wea nexus system the s o framework devoted to reconciling contradictions between socioeconomic and environmental development includes three objectives i e maximizing the net agricultural benefits minimizing the extent of swi and minimizing the extent of np results in the study indicate that the trade off relationships exist between the wea nexus system despite the net agricultural benefits in pareto optimal solutions are declined to various degrees the environmental objectives the extents of swi and np are improved compared to those in the pre optimized scheme the 2d pareto optimal schemes solutions 1 3 selected from the non dominated front between f nab and f enp sub problem exhibit decision bias in the 3d objective spaces during the management and governance process a highly isolated policy draft without considering the cross sectoral interactions and externalities would create sub optimal solutions and result in unexpected consequences e g water crises and environmental degradation therefore it is crucial for decision makers to identify the accurate wea nexus management schemes in the multi objective trade off surface declining the cultivation areas in different sub districts could facilitate the improvement of wea nexus compared with that of the maximal cropping scenario the implementation of optimal cropping schemes could avoid water scarcity and reduce the irrigation supply by approximately 2 21 107 m3 yr to 3 72 107 m3 yr in the future which is favorable to satisfy the water saving goal to supply enough water resources for the local eco environmental system moreover it is necessary to implement reasonable planting schemes formulated by pareto optimal solutions and take additional measurements to achieve minimal environmental impacts for example slow releasing fertilizers reuse of wastewater or reclaimed water as fertilizer water saving irrigation systems sprinkler and drip irrigation and reuse of desalinated seawater as irrigation water are practical alternatives for alleviating the extent of np meanwhile reasonable fallow patterns and rain fed schemes are pragmatic alternatives for mitigating the extent of swi in general the established multi objective s o framework is applicable to regional management across sectors in the semi arid coastal basins with complicated evolution of groundwater and intensive agricultural practices it should be noted that the uncertainty e g hydrogeological parameters various reaction rate parameters imprecise socioeconomic parameters and ambiguous decision preferences and complexity e g climate change land use change and non linear relationships in groundwater and agricultural systems are inevitable in the wea nexus management which will seriously intensify the difficulty for decision makers meanwhile some current deficiencies of the s o framework also need to be improved in further researches such as replenishing more detailed groundwater quality data to calibrate the long term variations of hydro geochemistry and building a fully coupled simulation model to reflect precisely the comprehensive impacts of different agricultural processes moreover the spatial temporal variations of np and the primary governing factors in different cropping sub districts need to be further explored therefore future research should focus on incorporating these factors into the multi objective s o model for the wea nexus management to avoid decision bias caused by the limitations of numerical simulation model and augment the robustness and reliability of the

16263,the quantification of trade offs between social economic and environmental effects is of great importance especially in the semi arid coastal areas with highly developed agriculture the study presents an integrated multi objective simulation optimization s o framework to evaluate the basin scale water environment agriculture wea nexus first the variable density groundwater model seawat is coupled to the reactive transport model rt3d for the first attempt to simulate the environmental effects subject to seawater intrusion swi and nitrate pollution np then the surrogate assisted multi objective optimization algorithm is utilized to investigate the trade offs between the net agricultural benefits and extents of swi and np while considering the water supply food security and land availability simultaneously the s o modeling methodology is applied to the dagu river basin drb a typical swi region with intensive agricultural irrigation in china it is shown that the three objective space based on pareto optimal front can be achieved by optimizing planting area in the irrigation districts indicating the optimal evolution of the wea nexus system the pareto optimal solutions generated by multi objective s o model are more realistic and pragmatic avoiding the decision bias that may often lead to cognitive myopia caused by the low dimensional objectives although the net agricultural benefits in pareto optimal solutions are declined to some extent the environmental objectives the extents of swi and np are improved compared to those in the pre optimized scheme therefore the proposed multi objective s o framework can be applied to the wea nexus in the river basin with intensive agriculture development which is significant to implement the integrated

2010 fao 2012 li et al 2019 additionally the potential of agricultural land expansion is limited worldwide due to the immense environmental risks and water demands foley et al 2005 abdelkader and elshorbagy 2021 water agriculture and food security policies are firmly connected to environmental policies and that degree of association needs to be explored to ensure overall coherence fao 2012 in the semi arid coastal areas groundwater is the fundamental resource for agricultural and environmental systems the intensive irrigation behaviors generate huge water stress and result in seawater intrusion swi in the coastal aquifer puggioni et al 2021 freshwater is unsuitable for drinking when its chloride concentration is greater than 250 mg l i e exceeding 1 of seawater werner et al 2013 it is noteworthy that most previous model based works performed in the coastal regions only focused on groundwater degradation due to swi sherif et al 2012 wang and meng 2016 chang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 zhong and wu 2020 to our knowledge the combined effect of the human derived agricultural non point pollution and swi in the coastal aquifer has attracted relatively limited concerns so far which is also a significant factor for groundwater contamination wallace et al 2020 torres martínez et al 2021 nitrate one of the most bioavailable forms of nitrogen is quite soluble in water and is not significantly adsorbed by soils lee et al 2006 nitrate dissolves and leaches into the underlying aquifers when the amount of fertilizer exceeds the crop demand and denitrification capacity wei et al 2019 wei and bailey 2021 nitrate pollution np in groundwater poses a substantial threat to ecological environment and it is considered hazardous for human health when the concentration of no3 n in drinking water is greater than the maximum contaminant level 10 mg l us epa 2009 xin et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 therefore health guidelines and regulations have been established to protect populations and limit adverse effects huo et al 2020 nitrification and denitrification control the fate of nitrogen stating as the two basic reactions that produce and reduce nitrate respectively knowles 1982 ammonia is rapidly oxidized to nitrate in the presence of oxygen by microorganisms catalyzing nitrification shah and coulman 1978 while denitrification converts nitrate to nitrogen gas under anoxic conditions with enough electron donor such as dissolved organic carbon doc duff and triska 1990 korom 1992 therefore it is essential to understand swi and np processes in the coastal aquifer for the preservation of environment and food security which is jointly affected by the hydrological processes biogeochemical transport agricultural activities and other internal and external stresses werner et al 2013 kim et al 2020 more recently the nexus of water food energy land and ecosystem has gained research interests especially in arid and semi arid areas sun et al 2018 niu et al 2019 abdelkader and elshorbagy 2021 jiang et al 2021b yue and guo 2021 the nexus approaches interact not only in the physical process but also in the social economic development so the appropriate modeling tools play vital roles in dealing with the problem cai et al 2018 the worldwide scholars have developed diverse optimization methodologies to interpret the inextricable connections of nexus such as mathematical optimization zhang and vesselinov 2017 niu et al 2019 zhang and ren 2021 and agent based modeling hu et al 2017 bieber et al 2018 the simulation optimization s o framework a practical framework for groundwater resources management can explain the complex groundwater flow behaviors and distinguish the optimal management schemes for a set of constraints singh 2015 song et al 2020 yang et al 2021b for example niu et al 2019 combined a multiple linear regression model based on the gsflow simulations with a multi objective linear fractional programming approach to elucidate the synergies and trade offs of the water ecosystem agriculture nexus in zhangye basin this study revealed the impacts of hydrological dynamics land use and water resources management rules on economic ecological and environmental efficiencies zhang and ren 2021 identified seasonal fallow schemes of haihe river basin by the s o framework which combined a modified swat model with linear programming to highlight the role of groundwater resources on the water food energy nexus however the real world groundwater management problems are generally complicated due to the nonlinear and multimodal objectives and constraints to some extent the challenge possibly results in the unavailability of traditional optimization algorithms for this reason the reliability and effectiveness of multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas have been extensively proved in recent years reed et al 2013 maier et al 2019 song et al 2018 2020 jiang et al 2021b yang et al 2021b exploring the complex relationships among the different nexus based on the linked s o framework is desirable but remains challenging on the one hand the wea nexus achieved the limited concerns so far in coastal areas densely populated and supporting marine organisms local agriculture fishery and tourism martínez et al 2007 on the other hand despite previous studies have provided a solid basis for alleviating the extent of swi based on the coastal groundwater management ataie ashtiani and ketabchi 2011 hussain et al 2015 song et al 2018 christelis and mantoglou 2019 yang et al 2021b the coupled s o model that accounts for swi and reactive nitrogen transport process in the coastal aquifer has yet to be quantified for the basin scale research moreover the variable density modeling and reactive nitrogen transport modeling are often highly nonlinear and accompanied by a huge computational burden during the operation the balance of saving computational cost and guaranteeing the accuracy of model prediction always determines the practicality and performance of the basin scale s o framework song et al 2018 yang et al 2021b therefore it is of great importance to integrate surrogate assisted multi objective s o framework for the scientific management of the wea nexus in basin scale coastal regions the dagu river basin drb in qingdao city of western jiaodong peninsula is confronting the challenges derived from water scarcity and environmental degradation the excessive fertilization and tillage and unregulated groundwater abstraction in the drb have caused many environmental issues including np and swi many researches have been accomplished qualitatively or quantitatively evaluating the environmental effects which offered more compelling and deeper insights into the water systems environmental issues and agriculture patterns in the drb zeng et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 jiang et al 2021a yang et al 2021a yin et al 2021 however the full analysis of the complex wea nexus using the multi objective s o framework has not been carried out in the coastal basin the study aims to develop the multi objective s o framework for exploring the alternative cropping strategies subject to the combined influences of swi and np in the s o framework 1 the seawat rt3d model is developed for the first attempt to assess swi and reactive nitrogen transport in the basin scale coastal aquifer and 2 the surrogate assisted multi objective optimization algorithm smoma kelm proposed by song et al 2018 is integrated into the validated numerical simulation model to predict the long term biogeochemical variations and optimize the regional cultivated strategy the multi objective s o model for the wea nexus in the coastal aquifer is devoted to reconciling contradictions between socioeconomic development and environmental preservation consequently maximizing net agricultural benefits and minimizing the extents of swi and np are considered as the management objectives the developed s o framework of the wea nexus is significant in gaining a deep insight into the real world coastal groundwater management problems ranging from quantifying and forecasting the long term hydrological and biogeochemical evolutions of coastal aquifer to achieving the trade offs among social economy water food security and environmental impacts 2 study area 2 1 hydrometeorological and hydrogeological conditions the drb is a typical agriculture dominated coastal basin in qingdao shandong province china and includes laixi county pingdu county jimo county and jiaozhou county encompassing 469 km2 the morphological architecture of the drb is regarded as the coastal plain valley with land elevation up to 45 m above sea level the study area exhibits warm monsoon continental and oceanic climate with an average annual temperature and potential evapotranspiration of 12 3 c and 983 9 mm respectively yin et al 2021 the mean precipitation rate is 678 7 mm during 1952 2020 with relatively nonuniform rates throughout the year most rainfall occurs between june and september rainy season accounting for almost 73 of the annual precipitation the basin comprises the dagu river the xiaogu river the wugu river and the liuhao river fig 1 the dagu river is the largest river with a total length of 179 9 km however the dagu river is an ephemeral river and its flow is frequently cut off because of insufficient runoff replenishment caused by climate change and anthropogenic interferences zhang et al 2020 due to the scarcity of surface water resources and the prohibitive cost 4 7 cny m3 cny stands for chinese yuan of seawater desalinization national research council 2008 zheng et al 2014 groundwater is the primary source for agricultural irrigation industry and domestic uses in the basin the increasing water demand and unregulated groundwater abstraction elevate the risks of swi near pumping wells in recent decades the balance between seawater and fresh water in the coastal aquifer has been broken leading to swi northward rapidly to alleviate the extent of swi a sequence of water conservancy projects such as subsurface dam forming groundwater reservoirs and river dams preventing river runoff discharge are constructed zhang et al 2020 on the other hand the excess use of chemical fertilizers and unreasonable irrigation practices have caused considerable nitrate loading and groundwater contamination in the irrigation districts therefore decision makers are firmly concerned with balancing the potential of groundwater abstraction and np derived from agricultural development in the central valley the aquifer consists of unconsolidated alluvial deposits i e sand gravel and clay the upper aquifer unit is formed by low permeable clayey sand and sandy clay with a thickness of 2 5 m the lower aquifer unit is formed by thick sand and gravel showing greater capacity of groundwater supply these aquifer units defined as an unconfined aquifer system with a thickness of approximately 10 20 m are the primary water supply zones besides the bottom of aquifer is constrained with cretaceous sandstone and shale bedrock as a no flow boundary yang et al 2021a 2 2 land use and agricultural practices agriculture is a crucial sector of the local economy that contributes 3 6 1010 cny yr to the gross domestic product gdp and employs 35 of the available rural workforce in qingdao city in recent decades crop yields have risen significantly increasing from 8 79 109 kg yr in 2001 to 9 29 109 kg yr in 2019 qingdao municipal statistics bureau 2020 the cultivable land residential and commercial area forest land grassland paddy field water body and unused land are the main land use types of the drb which are derived from the us landsat satellite remote sensing images with a

also grown in other periods depending on their growing habits water availability and local cultivation tradition the detailed spatial distribution and rotation schedules of different planting patterns in the drb are depicted in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively 3 methodology in this study the conjunctive s o framework translates the interlinkages between the wea nexus into a series of related mathematical formulations it incorporates the surrogate assisted multi objective s o framework with the calibrated seawat rt3d model to optimize the cropping areas and evaluate the effects of agricultural practices on the basin scale hydro economic and environmental developments the stages for solving the s o model can be summarized as follows stage 1 developing a numerical model to simulate the temporal evolutions and spatial distributions of variable density groundwater flow and salinity using seawat code to determine the areas of swi then the calibrated model is linked to the rt3d model to simulate reactive nitrogen transport subject to swi finally the well calibrated model can be employed to construct the kelm model in stage 2 and combined with the management model for solving the pareto optimal front in stage 3 stage 2 building kelm surrogate model it is regarded as an approximate simulator to generate the patterns of variable density groundwater flow and reactive nitrogen transport in coastal aquifers and reduce a substantial computational burden in the next stage the kelm model is trained adaptively to satisfy the desired fidelity level to reduce the prediction error accumulation of state variables and converge to the pareto optimal front the distinct advantages and mathematical expressions of kelm are presented in section s2 for the details of the theory configuration fig s1 applications and trends of kelm the readers can also refer to huang et al 2006 2012 and huang et al 2015 stage 3 establishing the wea nexus management model smoma kelm searches the pareto optimal solutions between three objectives subject to the water and food supply security and land availability finally the typical trade off schemes are selected to evaluate optimal agriculture practices economic and environmental benefits while the visual analytics tool is used to achieve the full analysis of the pareto front fig 4 introduces a typical wea nexus in the drb and the flowchart of the multi objective s o framework numerical modeling and the optimization algorithm used in the study are presented in the following sections moreover to clearly present the s o framework a list of notations is shown in table s1 3 1 numerical simulation modeling in this study numerical modeling is organized in two phases transient variable density groundwater flow and salt transport are first simulated by seawat to identify the hydrological flow patterns and salinity transport behaviors in the coastal aquifer the groundwater flow field and the heterogeneous distributions of chloride obtained from seawat are then coupled to a reactive transport model based on rt3d to simulate nitrogen reactions such as nitrification denitrification and so on reflecting the impacts of agricultural practices on coastal groundwater the general mathematical equation describing variable density groundwater flow is expressed as eq 1 guo and langevin 2002 the fate and transport of aqueous and solid phase species in saturated porous media can be stated as eq 2 and eq 3 respectively clement 1997 1 x i ρ k f i h f x i ρ ρ f ρ f z x i ρ s q s ρ s f h f t θ ρ c c t 2 x

the variable density numerical simulation model in this study is modified from our previous work of zhang et al 2020 using seawat a finite difference grid with dimensions of 150 m by 150 m is considered and it is discretized to 418 rows 189 columns and a single layer despite the spatial discretization is a little coarse it is determined by the need of simplifying the scientific calculations to balance computational efficiency and numerical accuracy the simulation period extends from january 2001 to december 2016 and each month is taken as a stress period it is marked in fig 1 and fig 2 that the northern eastern and western boundaries are all treated as no flow and no mass flux boundaries while the southern boundary is set to a general head boundary ghb and specified concentration boundary to simulate the interactions between groundwater and seawater in the coastal aquifer ghb the simplest head dependent flux boundary is different from the constant head and constant flux boundary it can characterize the hydraulic response of the boundaries to the groundwater condition variations harbaugh 2005 lu et al 2015 the referencing heads vary from 1 m to 1 m and the hydraulic conductance is 1000 m2 d besides the range of specified chloride concentrations is between 1350 mg l and 5048 mg l while nitrate is 5 15 mg l the subsurface dam with the top elevation of 0 m above sea level is adjacent to the southern boundary of the model domain and the dam s bottom is embedded into the bedrock in the numerical model the hydraulic conductivity of the cells occupied by the subsurface dam is set to 0 0001 m d to reflect its barrier effect on swi moreover the hydraulic connection on both sides of the subsurface dam occurs only if groundwater levels exceed 0 m so that it plays an essential role in mitigating the swi trend the precipitation infiltration irrigation potential evapotranspiration et groundwater abstraction and interactions with the dagu river are the crucial factors governing water resources in the drb the evapotranspiration evt1 package in modflow is utilized to simulate et from the phreatic surface determined by the extinct depth the potential et is equal to the maximum et rate when the water table is higher than the specified surface otherwise it is equal to 0 the various crop s irrigation quota determines the groundwater demand for agricultural irrigation furthermore the allocation of irrigation periods depends on their growing habits and local cultivation tradition hence the return flow of irrigation from agricultural areas is indispensable in the simulation model the dagu river is simulated by the river riv1 package which can model the interactions between rivers and underlying aquifers based on river levels and the hydraulic conductivity 5 m d of riverbed the calibrated process of transient state simulation includes some manual adjustments for hydraulic conductivity specific yield and longitudinal dispersivity by the trial and error technique to achieve a good fit between observed and calculated groundwater levels and reproduce the spatial temporal evolution of swi table 1 presents the physical and hydraulic parameter values calibrated in the study the accuracy of the numerical model is evaluated using root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r the criteria can also be used to estimate the performance of solute transport and the approximation of surrogate model the mathematical formulations are stated as follows 4 rmse v 1 v s v o v 2 v 5 r v 1 v o v o s v s v 1 v o v o 2 v 1 v s v s 2 where v is the total number of samples sv and ov are the simulated and observed groundwater level or solute concentration of the vth sample respectively s and o are the mean value of simulated and observed data respectively during the kelm training and testing processes sv and ov are the predicted value of surrogate model and the exact value of numerical simulation model for the vth sample respectively and s and o are the average value of the predicted and exact values respectively in phase i the groundwater flow field and the spatial distributions of chloride are obtained then the variable density model is coupled with a reactive transport model in phase ii the corresponding nitrogen reactions and additional reactive solutes nh4 no2 no3 n2 doc o2 and three microbes are introduced 3 1 2 phase ii reactive nitrogen transport model rt3d includes a broad range of solution algorithms to deal with the reactive process for the multi species solute transport based on kinetic rate equations lee et al 2006 put forward a nitrogen transformation module for rt3d that accounts for ammonium oxidation nitrification denitrification organic carbon oxidation and microbial reactions which reveals the fate and transport of nh4 no2 no3 n2 doc and o2 eqs 6 9 depict the primary reactions moreover the reaction rates reaction kinetics equations ordinary differential equations based on operator split strategy and biomass growth rate are all elucidated in section s3 chemical and kinetic parameter values used in the rt3d model are provided in table 1 6 n h 4 1 5 o 2 aq n o 2 2 h h 2 o

especially for the rapid agricultural development hansen et al 2017 therefore it is essential to quantify the amount of nitrogen loss and its contribution to hydrologic components across the drb the nl kg n ha yr in the study is calculated by the empirical equation pratt 1984 10 nl 0 20 n i d 0 712 where ni is the nitrogen fertilizer input kg ha yr and d is the drainage cm yr which is evaluated by the total infiltration recharge such as precipitation and irrigation return recharge yang et al 2021a for the entire 16 years the estimated nl value is with an average of 1 74 107 kg n yr 3 2 multi objective simulation optimization modeling 3 2 1 surrogate assisted multi objective optimization algorithm song et al 2018 optimized the groundwater abstraction strategies in large scale coastal aquifers by a novel smoma kelm model which is flexible to accommodate diverse objective functions and constraints targeting specified problems as illustrated in fig 4 the main steps of the smoma kelm are 1 generating an initial random population of crops planting areas using latin hypercube sampling lhs and then training the preliminary kelm model and then running the surrogate model to evaluate offspring individuals for alleviating the huge computational burden 2 selecting promising individuals accounting for 20 of population size from the approximate pareto solutions using hypervolume hv improvement and the crowding distance metrics at intervals of several generations 3 using the gaussian disturbance to find an promising candidate solution to enhance the local optimality of the offspring individuals 4 implementing adaptive training strategy i e re evaluating the promising pareto solutions utilizing seawat rt3d model and then re training the kelm model to improve the prediction accuracy of pareto optimal solution and 5 comparing all individuals stored in the archived solutions evaluated by the numerical model and then obtain final pareto optimal solutions finally a visual analytics package discoverydv is used to explore and analyze wea nexus management in multi dimensional objective spaces which can assist multi stakeholders and decision makers across sectors to select key trade off schemes based on various criteria or concerns the parameters required by the algorithm are summarized in table 2 in summary the smoma kelm achieves the capacity of the highly effective global search for pareto optimal front while finding high quality and diverse solutions using the local search operators it is noteworthy that the optimization algorithm saves a huge computational burden especially for basin scale swi and np s o model 3 2 2 wea nexus management model surrogate assisted multi objective s o framework is utilized to solve the wea nexus management model for sustainable agriculture development in the coastal region which is desired in reconciling contradictions between socioeconomic and environmental developments hence the management objectives include the maximization of the net agricultural benefits and minimization of the extents of swi and np the management period is set to 15 years to investigate the optimal plantation areas of crops in the drb reflecting the long term planning process of cropping pattern while considering the water and food supply security and land availability the objective functions and constraints are described as follows the economic objective the first objective f nab is denoted as the maximum net agricultural benefits in the drb showing the economic benefits of the agricultural system and it can be stated as 11 max f nab p 1 p s 1 s p c p s y p s a p s p 1 p s 1 s c c p s a p s where p represents the crop index p 1 for ww sm p 2 for wg o sm p 3 for wg o sgo p 4 for p go c p 5 for c c r p 6 for g t p 7 for t c and p 8 for t c p is the total number of crops s indicates the id of 15 sub districts as shown in fig 5 s is the total number of sub districts pcp s is the market price of pth crop in the sth sub region cny kg yp s is the yield of pth crop in the sth sub region kg ha ap s is the total planting area of pth crop in the sth sub region ha i e the sole decision variables ccp s is the total farming cost of pth crop in the sth sub region which contains seed fertilizer application land and labor expenses cny ha the environmental objectives as mentioned above the main environmental problems in the drb include 1 swi triggered by the unregulated pumping activities and 2 agricultural non point source pollutants from nl caused by the application of chemical fertilizers therefore the second objective f esi is to minimize the extent of swi and the third objective function f enp is to minimize the extent of np the extents of swi and np are evaluated by the maximum limit levels based on the standard for drinking water and the limit of salinity is 250 mg l while nitrate is 10 mg l the f esi and f enp can be stated as 12 min f esi t 1 t i 1 k c con c cl t k c if con c cl 250 mg l 13 min f enp t 1 t j 1 k n con c n o 3 t k n if con c n o 3 10 mg l where conccl represents the concentration of cl mg l and kc means the total number of cells where the conccl 250 mg l at the last year of the management period in the same way concno3 and kn indicate the concentration of no3 mg l and the total number of cells where the concno3 10 mg l at the last year of the management period respectively and t is the final year of the management period that consists of 12 stress periods the constraints of water security 14 q p s min q p s q p s max p 1 2 p s 1 2 s where p represents the crop index p 1

p s i n i is the initial tillable area of pth crop in the sth sub region ha r is the acceptable maximum reduction ratio of agricultural land which is set to be 30 in our study the adjusted agricultural land could turn into fallow or residential and commercial areas furthermore the reduced irrigation water demand is favorable to satisfy the water saving goal to supply enough water resources for the local eco environmental system meanwhile it is an effective strategy to avoid water scarcity on the other hand transferring the agricultural irrigation rate to urban and industrial uses could achieve higher economic benefits 4 results and analysis 4 1 seawat rt3d simulation results fig 6 a presents a comparison between the calibrated and observed groundwater levels over time in three typical monitoring wells which suggests that the long term seasonal fluctuation of groundwater levels can be accomplished based on the simulation model moreover the simulated groundwater levels fit well with observed groundwater levels at all observation wells over the simulation period with an rmse of 0 82 m and r of 0 997 fig 6b the spatial distributions of the flow field and chloride field at the end of the simulation period are presented in fig 7 the groundwater levels decrease from the piedmont to the southern boundary fig 7a and the simulated chloride concentrations range from 0 mg l to 5048 mg l fig 7b the upper and middle reaches are far away from the shoreline so that the initial chloride concentration derived from swi is equal to 0 mg l the swi region is separated into two sub regions the intruded zones with chloride values 250 mg l are mainly located either in the nearshore area or in the northern saltwater residual area where the depression cones of groundwater flow are formed in the historical period due to unconstrained groundwater abstraction the total encroachment area decreases from 70 km2 in 1998 zhang et al 2020 to 57 km2 in 2016 due to the construction of the subsurface dam and the reduction of groundwater abstraction however these results from our study also show that the residual saltwater zone in the aquifer is very difficult to clean up thoroughly which may be attributed to the aquifer heterogeneity and subsurface dam preventing the natural submarine groundwater discharge yang et al 2021b indicated that the swi zone in turn can be considered as the potential effective recharge area for artificial injection in displacing seawater therefore they proposed a conjunctive management model for simultaneously developing optimal design of pumping and injection strategies which is pragmatic to mitigate the extent of swi in terms of np fig 8 a exhibits the simulated and observed nitrate concentrations at three groundwater monitoring locations over time the results combined with fig 8b indicate that the reactive model captures the within season and long term evolution processes of nitrate with an rmse of 17 61 mg l and r of 0 768 for all observation wells of groundwater quality the w04 w08 and w23 are in the c c r g t and p go c sub region respectively the seasonal pattern of nitrate is characterized by increase in the sowing and growing periods due to the utilization of fertilization and decline in the harvesting periods contributing to denitrification and negligible nl both box plot fig 8c and the solute field fig 8d manifest that the nitrate concentrations in the upper and middle reaches are higher than the observations in the lower reaches the reason for the phenomena is that the vegetable plantations are ubiquitous in the northern areas while the residential and commercial areas occupy the southern regions moreover the southern sub districts of the aquifer are mainly cultivated with ww sm indicating that the nitrate mass loading is limited the concentration hot spots close to the model boundary demonstrate the slower circulation and more prolonged nitrate accumulation these results are in good agreement with yang et al 2021a the well calibrated seawat rt3d model can be used to calculate the objectives and constraints of the management model under the s o framework and consider the wea nexus 4 2 kelm emulation results in section 4 1 the seawat rt3d model accurately describes the spatial temporal evolutions of swi and np in the drb evaluation of a single scheme with a high fidelity numerical simulation model takes about 5 min on a desktop pc equipped with a 3 80 ghz intel i7 processor and 16 gb of ram before using the smoma kelm it needs to call the seawat rt3d model 20600 times in the s o framework and the total runtime is about 1717 h however the smoma kelm employing surrogate model requires only about 50 h for the performance of 600 numerical simulation runs for initial training and testing besides 1000 high fidelity model runs by the evolutionary search for adaptive training of kelm model during the wea nexus management need approximately 84 h therefore the lower fidelity kelm as the surrogate model is used to replace the original seawat rt3d model to reduce the computational burden in the optimization the lhs generates 500 samples from planting areas to train kelm surrogate model moreover another 100 patterns of cropping are randomly generated to quantify the capability of kelm in capturing the interrelation between state variables i e cl and no3 concentrations reflecting the state of seawat rt3d model and decision variables i e planting areas representing the specific strategy of wea nexus management model rmse and r are used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the developed kelm model as shown in table 4 the predicted concentrations of cl and no3 based on training and testing surrogate model have good agreements with those results obtained from the seawat rt3d simulation model this result demonstrates that the kelm model a computationally efficient approximate model has the advantage of reproducing the nonlinear behaviors during swi and reactive nitrogen transport processes it can substitute for the seawat rt3d model in the s o framework furthermore to improve the accuracy of kelm model in the optimization process the smoma kelm algorithm will re train the surrogate model based on re evaluated optimal local individuals by the seawat rt3d model to improve the prediction accuracy of pareto optimal solutions the adaptive training strategy for kelm model guides the evolutionary search towards the region composed of optimal solutions song et al 2018 4 3 optimization results 4 3 1 pareto optimal solutions a multi objective s o framework is used to deal with the wea nexus management model consisting of three objectives f nab f esi and f enp to search for optimal planting schemes the improvements in one objective can only be accomplished by degrading performance in the remaining objectives due to the conflicts existed in the wea nexus hence an optimal set of non inferior decision variables constitutes what is termed the non dominated or pareto optimal set reflecting the conflicts or trade offs among f nab f esi and f enp the 484 pareto optimal solutions are identified as equally good unless the preferences of decision makers have been identified fig 9 a shows a global view of the trade off surface in the four dimensional 4d coordinate plot the f enp f esi and f nab are plotted on the x y and z axes respectively meanwhile the total groundwater irrigation rate f tgi depicted with color is added to compare the nexus of water environment and agriculture the navy blue arrow indicates the preferred direction for each objective it is shown that the trade off relationship exists between the wea nexus system enlarging the cultivation areas of diverse crops increases the net agricultural profits with the solutions marked in red but it simultaneously requires more agricultural water demands which is the predominant factor for nl into underlying coastal aquifers and seawater intruding into freshwater zones it might be challenging to explore the trade off surface for this reason the parallel coordinates are used to elucidate the discrepancy of pareto optimal solutions as illustrated in fig 9b parallel coordinates include four equal distance parallel axes representing the three dimensional 3d objective vectors and the f tgi all pareto optimal solutions cover a range of 2 82 f nab 3 49 109 cny yr 1429 55 f esi 1470 54 mg l 34 45 f enp 39 35 mg l and 7 18 f tgi 8 69 107 m3 yr in fig 9b many slope segments exist between f nab and f enp as well as f esi and f tgi suggesting obvious trade offs for the wea nexus consequently basin scale cropping patterns conflict with the socioeconomic and environmental interests in the drb the present irrigable area of 15 sub districts ids 1 15 is about 3 06 104 ha accounting for 65 of the drb given that the recurring drought periods and long term shortages of runoff replenishment into the aquifer have become bottlenecks restricting the development of the drb the climate background is set as a consecutive normal year with the precipitation is about 574 mm and the river levels decreasing from the piedmont 42 m to the southern boundary 2 m during the management period to explore the optimal cultivation scheme besides the groundwater irrigation rate in different cropping sub regions is calculated by the irrigation quota presented in table 3 however the present cropping strategy depletes groundwater storage for the normal year therefore the maximum total planting area i e the maximum area of well irrigation is set at approximately 2 65 104 ha to avoid the groundwater scarcity of the coastal aquifer the maximum cultivation scheme is marked with the square green box in fig 9a and a dark blue straight line in fig 9b respectively this scheme shows a relatively higher net profit and greater average chloride and nitrate concentrations simultaneously to some extent the present planting scheme and the maximum cropping area used in the study are both sub optimal which should be adjusted to obtain synergies from the wea nexus the optimized management schemes play crucial roles in avoiding cognitive myopia between different sectors moreover the compromise scheme achieving a higher net agricultural benefit with more minor negative impacts in the non dominated set should be favored in the process of decision making in addition all objective values are normalized to dimensionless values between 0 and 1 and the reference point is set to the objective vector 1 1 1 to evaluate the hv indicator of approximate pareto solutions which is a general metric to indicate the convergence of multi objective evolutionary search fig 10 depicts the variations of the hv metric over the number of generations that are slightly slower during earlier generations but it accelerates the convergence during the middle generations as illustrated in fig 10 the pareto front gradually improves and achieves a steady hv value at the final stage without sacrificing the accuracy of pareto optimal solutions the excellent search performance of smoma kelm benefits from the adaptive strategy that improves the precision of kelm model and the local search that enhances the capability of exploration over the objective space 4 3 2 optimized management schemes the decision makers can firstly investigate the performance of non dominated solutions in the lower order objective space and then examine the trade off solutions based on the previous analysis in the 3d space to satisfy the multi stakeholders preferences and generate synergies across all sectors fig 11 delineates the projections of three objective pareto solutions into two dimensional 2d space the navy blue arrow indicates the preferred direction for each objective the pareto front in the f nab and f enp objective space contains 125 solutions where the increasing rate of f enp is slower when f nab 3 30 109 cny yr subsequently the enhancing trend of f enp is visible fig 11a solutions 1 3 are the pareto optimal solutions in the non dominated front in the f nab and f enp sub problem which may be selected by decision makers with preference as illustrated in fig 11b the pareto front corresponded to the trade off between f nab and f esi is composed of 24 pareto optimal solutions in which the extent of swi promptly exacerbates from 1429 55 mg l to 1454 68 mg l with the net farming incomes raising from 3 40 109 cny yr to 3 49 109 cny yr however it can be noted that solutions 1 3 exhibit worse performance in the f nab and f esi objective space which implies that multi objective trade offs could help reduce the decision bias that occurs in low dimensional optimization problems thus it is crucial for the decision makers to identify the accurate compromise solution which performs well in the three objectives space simultaneously in this study four specific solutions are selected to interpret the impacts on the wea nexus compared to the maximum cultivation scheme solution 8 table 5 exhibits the objective values of the selected pareto solutions in comparison with the optimization results obtained from fig 9 and fig 11 solution 4 corresponds to the compromise solution in the 3d objective space which can be selected by decision makers with no preference for management objectives solution 5 has the most considerable objective value of f nab in the pareto front satisfying the constraints of water food security and land availability moreover solution 6 with a minimum value of f enp and solution 7 with a minimum value of f esi represent the optimal performance in conserving local groundwater quality respectively solution 6 and solution 8 are located at the top and bottom end of the second axis of parallel coordinates respectively and the difference in nitrate concentration is about 5 10 mg l solution 7 can minimize the extent of swi and achieve a relatively lower concentration of nitrate which is second only to solution 6 among the selected solutions in comparison with solution 8 although the f nab of the other four solutions have declined to various degrees the environmental objectives f enp and f esi have been improved and the risk of groundwater scarcity in coastal aquifers has been alleviated simultaneously fig 12 shows the discrepancy of solutions 4 8 in cultivation areas and the δirrigation δirrigation is the difference between f tgi s4 s5 s6 s7 and f tgi s8 of the respective out of 15 cropping sub districts solution 4 shows that the cultivation areas except for id 3 id 9 id 11 and id 15 should decrease compared with solution 8 while the areas of id 5 and ids 12 14 should be reduced to the minimal planting areas the compromise strategy achieves a relatively higher f nab and lower concentrations of f enp and f esi which can save about 0 76 107 m3 yr of irrigation water solution 5 which is very similar to solution 8 exhibits that grain rotations i e the cultivation of ww sm and vegetable grain rotation i e the cultivation of wg o sm should be diminished to obtain more net agricultural benefits the grains net profits are relatively lower than high value vegetables especially those with multiple harvests this solution will be the most desired solution for stakeholders in the agricultural sector from the socioeconomic perspective however the sustainable food supply in the future might be questionable it is acknowledged that food imports alone are far from sustaining the huge food demands not to mention the basic staple foods wheat and maize in china furthermore in the light of the importance of planting diversity the crop area of grains should also be guaranteed instead of blindly pursuing higher agricultural economic benefits solution 6 the minimization of f enp objective is aimed at alleviating the impacts of np in the coastal aquifer which shows the planting areas of all 15 sub districts should be reduced moreover the ideal scheme with the minimal f esi solution 7 illustrates that the reduction of cultivation area in the drb except for id 1 id 3 and id 15 zones is essential it can be noted that the chloride concentration of the solution 7 is similar to that in the 3d compromise solution solution 4 which demonstrates that adjusting the planting patterns is a practical strategy to alleviate the extent of swi especially for the sub districts close to swi zones or with relatively larger cropping area moreover a large amount of groundwater can be saved using solution 6 and solution 7 1 63 107 m3 yr and 1 17 107 m3 yr respectively in comparison to solution 8 which is favorable to satisfy the water saving goal to supply enough water resources for the local eco environmental system therefore the optimization results obtained from our study can provide the candidate schemes for the multi stakeholders across sectors of the wea nexus in the drb furthermore the one factor at a time oat sensitivity analysis is employed to examine the response relationships between f enp and the corresponding chemical and kinetic parameters through increasing and decreasing their calibrated values by 10 the results presented in fig s2 suggest that the maximum substrate utilization rates in the specific process the half saturation constant of doc and the microbial yield coeffificients and death or maintenance rate constants of bacteria are the primary governing factors on the reactive nitrogen transport process as shown in fig 13 and fig 14 the seasonal and zonal variations of the average nitrate concentrations at the last year of the management period are depicted to exhibit the pareto optimal solutions from the proposed multi objective s o framework it can be illustrated in fig 13 that the average nitrate concentrations before optimization fluctuate from 41 22 mg l to 42 28 mg l and the extent of np is obviously alleviated after optimization the concentrations of solution 5 and solution 8 are higher than that of the compromise solution and the solutions with minimum environmental negative impacts the nitrate seasonal evolution of the selected solutions is characterized by increase in the sowing and growing periods and decrease in the harvesting periods under the same climate background the larger the planting area is the more the chemical fertilizers are applied correspondingly it would increase the pressure for the underlying aquifers due to the significant amount of nl the coastal aquifer is more vulnerable to np when the cropping schemes are unsuitable for the preservation of groundwater resources regarding the spatial distributions of np the sub regions with high nitrate concentrations especially the wg o sgo sub region id 5 g t sub region id 7 and t c sub region id 11 are mainly located in the upper and middle reaches the applications of chemical fertilizers are approximately 1503 kg n ha yr 1199 kg n ha yr and 1080 kg n ha yr for the above three vegetables rotation areas respectively the extensive nitrogen loading from agricultural practices and the intensive vertical water exchange trigger the immense nl into the underlying aquifers moreover the reduced nitrate s residence time in the unsaturated zone is unfavorable to crop uptake and nitrogen natural attenuation the average nitrate concentrations are generally smaller than 30 mg l in the lower reaches cultivated with ww sm which may be attributed to the limited requirements of chemical fertilizers for the grains and the less amount of nl ascribed to the insufficient precipitation recharge and irrigation return recharge in some clay areas it can be seen in fig 14 that the selected pareto optimal solutions solution 4 and solution 6 have the advantage in mitigating the extent of np within the high value crops planting sub districts however the extent of np within the southern grains plantations is barely affected by the optimal cultivation schemes the phenomenon may be the consequence of the hydrological processes the contaminant plume gradually transports from northern vegetable cultivated sub districts to southern grain cultivated sub districts at the end of the management period in the maximum planting scenario solution 8 the highest nitrate concentrations of ids 13 15 sub districts are all greater than that of solution 4 and solution 6 however the average nitrate concentrations of the two solutions are lower than solution 8 which may be the results of the evaluation method based on average values moreover the reactive transport of nitrate is complex and comprehensively affected by biogeochemical transport agricultural activities and other endogenous and exogenous stresses the spatial temporal variations of np and the primary governing factors in different cropping sub districts need to be further explored to confirm our preliminary analysis above 5 discussion the optimization analysis of planting patterns under the context of wea nexus could gain the decision information on trade offs of social economic development water and food supply security and environmental health and then achieve a transition to sustainability the s o framework used in the study permits decision makers or stakeholders to visualize the nexus outcomes in general decision makers in the different sectors seek different development goals for the water resources system hydrologists and decision makers have long devoted themselves to managing trade offs of water demand versus water supply water quality versus water quantity beneficiaries in the upper reaches versus beneficiaries in the lower reaches and environmental impacts versus economic benefits cai et al 2018 in the context of the wea nexus these trade offs will become increasingly complex because more and more sub sectors and stakeholders are involved therefore our study results will play vital roles in reallocating groundwater resources for agricultural irrigation which further affects food supply nl and swi in the coastal aquifer of drb in the semi arid coastal areas the shortages of precipitation recharge and the replenishment of river runoff due to the dam in the upper reaches induce that adjusting the planting patterns is an effective strategy to allocate the irrigation water demand while considering the food supply and environmental risks the proposed wea nexus management model implements the optimization of planting patterns by setting the objectives and constraints to guarantee food security over the management period the current groundwater irrigation rate is about 1 09 108 m3 yr while the optimal cropping schemes can reduce the irrigation supply by approximately 2 21 107 m3 yr to 3 72 107 m3 yr the groundwater resources in the upper and middle reaches are characterized by higher nitrate concentrations and lower chloride concentrations and vice versa in the lower reaches from the perspective of water cycle or reuse the nitrogen mass accumulated over decades in the drb could be regarded as valuable nutrient resources for crops to improve water use efficiencies and reduce the application of chemical fertilizers as a marginal water resource the saline groundwater can be applied to irrigating high value crops after desalination moreover in order to meet the increasing requirement of irrigation water appropriate water allocation and non conventional water resource management should be incorporated into the wea nexus such as rainfall stormwater runoff cooling water hydraulic fracturing wastewater process wastewater from pulp paper and food industries and domestic sewage as discussed by chen et al 2021 for the environmental system the decision makers pay more attention to alleviating the environmental deterioration caused by the multiple stresses the decline of some crops areas such as ww sm and p go c cultivations close to the swi zones is essential for relieving the seawater encroachment the extent of swi is sensitive to the variations of the cultivation areas in ids 12 15 as shown in fig s3 the enlargement of the four sub districts planting areas could lead to more severe environmental degradation for the extent of np the changes of nitrate concentrations are most obvious in the id 5 wg o sgo sub district accounting for the largest planting area among all cultivable types producing enormous nl into the underlying coastal aquifers moreover it is noteworthy that the mean values of nitrate concentrations in the respective 15 cropping sub districts are all greater than 10 mg l despite implementing the wea nexus optimization management which reflects that lowering the levels of the groundwater contamination to the drinking water standard is very difficult for regional nitrate contaminated aquifers in productive agriculture centered areas hansen et al 2017 have noted that in some parts of the western world the enhanced nitrogen management has significantly alleviated the np in groundwater systems although it often still does not meet groundwater and drinking water standards in all areas hence it is necessary to take some additional measurements to alleviate the extent of np based on the reasonable planting schemes formulated by pareto optimal solutions for example the slow releasing fertilizer is a practical alternative with equal nutrient supplies and less nitrogen mass loss applying this fertilizer can lower about 36 of chemical fertilizer usage yang et al 2021a in addition water saving irrigation systems like sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation are required to mitigate the vertical water exchange and reduce nl for the agricultural system the stakeholders usually focus on crop yields boosting economic development and ensuring food supply as mentioned above swi is sensitive to the variations of the ids 12 15 sub districts however wheat and maize are the basic staple foods in china and the yield will be sacrificed completely once the planting areas of ww sm are reduced to alleviate the extent of swi to deal with this problem rice could be an alternative crop to attain multi dimensional benefits alleviate the extent of swi and balance soil salinity on the other hand reasonable fallow patterns and rain fed schemes are crucial for the sustainability of groundwater irrigation in the wea nexus i e replacing the traditional ww sm double cropping with sm single cropping in the successive years and implementing rain fed during the sm growing season zhang and ren 2021 it is noteworthy that the cultivation areas cannot easily increase because the crops would take years to grow and then become fully productive furthermore once the land use type is turned into the residential and commercial areas during the urbanization process it would be irreversible for the short term development therefore in order to avoid cognitive myopia between the different sectors the stakeholders should make holistic decisions considering the interdependence of the wea nexus the compromise scheme solution 4 should be favored in the study because it can achieve a higher net agricultural benefit with more minor negative impacts during the management and governance process a highly isolated policy draft without considering the cross sectoral interactions and externalities would create sub optimal solutions and result in unexpected consequences e g water scarcity food crises and environmental degradation making integrating and implementing policies in the nexus paradigm is and will continue to be a challenging task so that it is of great significance to fulfill the knowledge gaps in the nexus which can be summarized as follows 1 there is no blueprint for overcoming institutional disconnect between sectors e g water food and environment are generally regulated by separate administrations markets and engineering infrastructure and even blue and green water are divided into different departments 2 there is no consensus on what degree can higher availability of one resource sustainably relieve the scarcity of another and how might this work at different spatial and temporal scales hoff 2011 cai et al 2018 and 3 there is no standard or harmonized framework that could be utilized to explore the trade offs and potential synergies between various nexus systems due to different governance rules around the world central planning means that economic decisions concerning the manufacturing and the distribution of products are made by the central authority i e government it is different from the free market in which such decisions are generally made by businesses and consumers given that food security and hydro environmental health are always neglected by markets it is imperative for governments of regions and nations to implement regulation and unified action to reduce the negative externalities across sectors moreover the nexus approach emphasis the linkage of government and market mechanism in which comprehensive optimization management with inclusive multi stakeholders bottom up negotiation and participation across sectors are implemented chances are that the transition to sustainability will be achieved if the wea nexus is addressed coherently across all spatial temporal scales in the forms of multi level governance with differentiated but clearly defined responsibilities of sectors hoff 2011 this study attempts to develop a conjunctive s o framework to explore the complex interrelationships of the wea nexus in the semi arid coastal aquifer the pareto optimal solutions generated by the multi objective s o model are more realistic and pragmatic which play crucial roles in making holistic decisions and reconciling contradictions between socioeconomic and environmental developments in general the developed multi objective s o model in the study is universal it can be applied in most coastal areas with highly developed agriculture when 1 the resources e g groundwater supply and farmland availability are limited and it is indispensable to reallocate them sustainably to enhance the synergies across sectors and 2 the environmental degradation has been restricting the development of the region and it is crucial to mitigate the pollution to diminish trade offs between social economy and environment the wea nexus management model in the study provides the most fundamental objectives and constraints in addressing the above problems there is no need to adjust the structure of the s o framework because it is flexible to perfect the objective functions and constraints targeting additional problems for example if the decision makers in the wea nexus pay more attention to food supply demand or water quality improvement i e restrict the groundwater concentrations within the maximum permissible limits in that case the corresponding constraints could be added to the original s o model easily the evolution of groundwater quality and the fluctuation of net agricultural benefits are diverse within different planting schemes for this reason the full analysis of the pareto front based on the visual analytics tool is of great importance to real world applications and policy formulations furthermore the surrogate assisted multi objective s o framework is applicable for decision makers to determine their desired wea nexus management schemes with preferred objectives and achieve minimal environmental impacts and maximal economic profits simultaneously nexus thinking desired a shift from single focus on a certain sub sector to cross sectoral focus on the wea nexus system is the kernel in the study the nexus has emerged as a pragmatic concept to reproduce the complicated and interdependent nature of the wea systems on which people depend to achieve various social economic and hydro environmental goals in practical terms it provides a deeper insight for systematically analyzing the interactions between natural ecosystems and anthropogenic activities the new paradigm plays a vital role in enhancing full system efficiencies generating synergies diminishing trade offs and implementing more integrated cost effective and environment friendly planning or decision making moreover the pareto optimal solutions generated by the multi objective s o model have an advantage in avoiding the decision bias that may often lead to cognitive myopia caused by the low dimensional objectives 6 conclusions in the semi arid coastal regions water security cannot be separated from food security because the food production demands make the agriculture sector the primary water consumer furthermore water and agricultural policies are firmly combined with environmental guidelines any degradation in water quality leads to a decline in agricultural security and an increase of ecological vulnerability and that degree of nexus needs to be explored to ensure overall coherence for this purpose this study develops a multi objective s o model by integrating a basin scale numerical simulation model seawat rt3d with an optimization algorithm smoma kelm the framework intrinsically linked water environment and agriculture sectors in the real world is successfully applied to the drb a typical swi region with intensive agricultural irrigation in china the well calibrated simulation model reasonably describes the spatial temporal evolutions of swi and np in the drb from 2001 to 2016 moreover to reduce the computational burden and improve the accuracy of pareto optimal solutions the smoma kelm is utilized to search the optimal cropping patterns for the wea nexus system the s o framework devoted to reconciling contradictions between socioeconomic and environmental development includes three objectives i e maximizing the net agricultural benefits minimizing the extent of swi and minimizing the extent of np results in the study indicate that the trade off relationships exist between the wea nexus system despite the net agricultural benefits in pareto optimal solutions are declined to various degrees the environmental objectives the extents of swi and np are improved compared to those in the pre optimized scheme the 2d pareto optimal schemes solutions 1 3 selected from the non dominated front between f nab and f enp sub problem exhibit decision bias in the 3d objective spaces during the management and governance process a highly isolated policy draft without considering the cross sectoral interactions and externalities would create sub optimal solutions and result in unexpected consequences e g water crises and environmental degradation therefore it is crucial for decision makers to identify the accurate wea nexus management schemes in the multi objective trade off surface declining the cultivation areas in different sub districts could facilitate the improvement of wea nexus compared with that of the maximal cropping scenario the implementation of optimal cropping schemes could avoid water scarcity and reduce the irrigation supply by approximately 2 21 107 m3 yr to 3 72 107 m3 yr in the future which is favorable to satisfy the water saving goal to supply enough water resources for the local eco environmental system moreover it is necessary to implement reasonable planting schemes formulated by pareto optimal solutions and take additional measurements to achieve minimal environmental impacts for example slow releasing fertilizers reuse of wastewater or reclaimed water as fertilizer water saving irrigation systems sprinkler and drip irrigation and reuse of desalinated seawater as irrigation water are practical alternatives for alleviating the extent of np meanwhile reasonable fallow patterns and rain fed schemes are pragmatic alternatives for mitigating the extent of swi in general the established multi objective s o framework is applicable to regional management across sectors in the semi arid coastal basins with complicated evolution of groundwater and intensive agricultural practices it should be noted that the uncertainty e g hydrogeological parameters various reaction rate parameters imprecise socioeconomic parameters and ambiguous decision preferences and complexity e g climate change land use change and non linear relationships in groundwater and agricultural systems are inevitable in the wea nexus management which will seriously intensify the difficulty for decision makers meanwhile some current deficiencies of the s o framework also need to be improved in further researches such as replenishing more detailed groundwater quality data to calibrate the long term variations of hydro geochemistry and building a fully coupled simulation model to reflect precisely the comprehensive impacts of different agricultural processes moreover the spatial temporal variations of np and the primary governing factors in different cropping sub districts need to be further explored therefore future research should focus on incorporating these factors into the multi objective s o model for the wea nexus management to avoid decision bias caused by the limitations of numerical simulation model and augment the robustness and reliability of the

16264,poor lipid degradation limits low temperature anaerobic treatment of domestic wastewater even when psychrophiles are used we combined metagenomics and metaproteomics to find lipolytic bacteria and their potential and actual cold adapted extracellular lipases in anaerobic membrane bioreactors treating domestic wastewater at 4 and 15 c of the 40 recovered putative lipolytic metagenome assembled genomes mags only three chlorobium desulfobacter and mycolicibacterium were common and abundant relative abundance 1 in all reactors notably some mags that represented aerobic autotrophs contained lipases therefore we hypothesised that the lipases we found are not always associated with exogenous lipid degradation and can have other roles such as polyhydroxyalkanoates pha accumulation degradation and interference with the outer membranes of other bacteria metaproteomics did not provide sufficient proteome coverage for relatively lower abundant proteins such as lipases though the expression of fadl genes long chain fatty acid transporters was confirmed for four genera dechloromonas azoarcus aeromonas and sulfurimonas none of which were recovered as putative lipolytic mags metaproteomics also confirmed the presence of 15 relatively abundant 1 genera in all reactors of which at least 6 can potentially accumulate lipid polyhydroxyalkanoates for most putative lipolytic mags there was no statistically significant correlation between the read abundance and reactor conditions such as temperature phase biofilm and bulk liquid and feed type treated by ultraviolet light or not results obtained by metagenomics and metaproteomics did not confirm each other and extracellular lipases and lipolytic bacteria were not easily identifiable in the anaerobic membrane reactors

introduction anaerobic treatment of domestic wastewater generates energy and produces much less sludge than the conventional activated sludge process however it is still rarely adopted at full scale outside of south america aquino et al 2019 where the reactors work well at ambient temperatures 23 34 c therefore for 60 of the world population that lives in countries with a temperate climate using anaerobic treatment for treating domestic wastewater is problematic the major limitation is related to the first step in anaerobic digestion hydrolysis in this step fermentative bacteria degrade large biopolymers like carbohydrates proteins and lipids presumably by producing extracellular enzymes yet at low temperatures the rate of biological reactions drops and hydrolysis becomes rate limiting lipids degrade more slowly than carbohydrates or proteins at low temperatures forming the bulk of the chemical oxygen demand cod in the effluents petropoulos et al 2018 and a lipid rich scum layer in the reactors soares et al 2019 operational interventions such as a skimmer to remove the scum layer lettinga et al 1984 may help but do not address the fundamental issues of compliance or energy recovery the estimated methane yield from 1 g glycerol trioleate an abundant natural lipid is 1 08 l at standard temperature and pressure while for 1 g glucose this is only 0 37 l kim and shin 2010 at bench pilot scale it is possible to treat domestic wastewater anaerobically at ambient temperatures and as low as 4 c in different bioreactor configuration kong et al 2021 lim et al 2019 maleki et al 2019 mcateer et al 2020 petropoulos et al 2017 2018 2021 2019 ribera pi et al 2020 yang et al 2020 baffled or multi compartment reactors benefit the rate limiting hydrolysis step by providing longer retention time these reactors have shown good cod removal performance at low temperatures by using mesophilic biomass hahn and figueroa 2015 pfluger et al 2018a pfluger et al 2018b however there is no evidence to show to what extent these reactors can remove lipids lipids remained undegraded unlike carbohydrates and proteins even when the psychrophilic microbial community is used to treat domestic wastewater anaerobically at 4 8 and 15 c in anmbrs petropoulos et al 2018 a lipolytic organism must be able to produce extracellular lipases to degrade lipids and then transport the long chain fatty acids back into the cell to be metabolised for example by the beta oxidation pathway due to the difference of the cell wall structure in gram negative and gram positive bacteria the export of lipases and import of long chain fatty acids may differ for instance in gram negative bacteria long chain fatty acid transporter proteins fadl have been identified for carrying the long chain fatty acids to the cells however such transporters have not yet been identified for the gram positive bacteria salvador lópez and van bogaert 2021 but presumably exist poor lipid degradation at low temperatures could be due to a lack of lipase production a lack of lipase activity low rates of fatty acid transport or a slow beta oxidation pathway understanding these limitations would be easier if we knew the identity of the lipolytic bacteria and ideally any accompanying cheaters bacteria that consume long chain fatty acids without producing lipases the present study therefore aims to investigate the lipolytic potential of the psychrophilic bacteria adapted to treat domestic wastewater anaerobically at 4 and 15 c we combined molecular biology tools such as metagenomics and metaproteomics to find potential and actual expressed lipase genes or other lipolytic biomarkers like fadl genes as well as lipase producers and cheaters 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor description and sampling four anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs and their duplicates 1l working volume were developed to operate at 4 and 15 c with cold adapted biomass these working temperatures were selected based on the previous study published by petropoulos et al 2017 schematic diagram of the reactors and the details about biomass acclimation feed operational conditions and reactors performance are included in supplementary file 1 in brief the reactors were inoculated by putative psychrophilic biomass collected from the sediment and soils of lake geneva n 46 23 04 e 6 25 07 switzerland annual minimum and maximum temperature 11 and 21 c and svalbard n 78 e 11 15 16 norway annual minimum and maximum temperature 16 and 6 c respectively primary domestic influent collected from an activated sludge plant tudhoe mill county durham uk was used as a feed the feed was introduced into the reactors either as sterile treated with ultraviolet light to exclude mesophilic biomass of the feed or non sterile the psychrophilic biomass was acclimated to both the operating temperatures 4 and 15 c and feed types as described by petropoulos et al 2017 2019 2021 through series of batch and continuous experiments which lasted for more than three years in this study we re acclimated the reactors for two months hydraulic retention time was 60 h and sampled from both the bulk liquid and biofilm formed on the membrane on day 65 when the reactors were working at the steady state at the above mentioned operational conditions 2 2 metagenomics and data analysis dna was extracted from the anmbrs samples both from the bulk liquid and biofilm formed on the membrane at day 65 using the ctab method griffiths et al 2000 and sent for sequencing hiseq 2500 platform to the earlham institute norwich amplification free illumina compatible libraries were constructed using the kapa hyper prep kit aliquots of each samples were run on two lanes two flowcells to generate paired end pe 250 reads of about 300 mb fastqc v0 11 5 was employed to check the quality of reads and cutadapt v1 18 and trimmomatic v0 36 were used to trim the adapters and poor regions removed parts from the read 1 were agatcggaagagcacacgtctgaactccagtca and from the read 2 were agatcggaagagcgtcgtgtagggaaagagtgt respectively filtered reads were co assembled with megahit v 1 2 9 using a high performance computer at newcastle university obtained contigs were then binned with metabat2 v1 7 to recover the metagenome assembled genomes mags to evaluate the quality of the bins checkm v1 0 18 was used and mags with more than 90 completeness and less than 10 contamination were selected as putative lipolytic bins the fasta file of the selected mags were uploaded to kbase arkin et al 2018 and annotated using prokka v1 12 after annotation lipase genes were searched with their ec number 3 1 1 3 mags that had at least one putative lipase gene were specified as putative lipolytic bins specific ec numbers of other hydrolytic enzymes like phosphatases proteases esterases and carbohydrate degraders were also searched supplementary file 2 table s1 further analysis like the taxonomic classification was performed by gtdb tk v0 3 2 on the putative lipolytic mags at kbase to find the relative abundance of the microorganisms existing at each reactor condition reads from both biofilm and liquid phase of the replicate reactors at each temperature and treatment set up were merged with kbase apps and were analysed with gottcha2 v2 1 5 all statistical analysis was performed using minitab 18 all metagenomics data are accessible at european nucleotide archive ena under the accession number prjeb47041 2 3 metaproteomics and data analysis before protein extraction volatile suspended solid vss was measured following the standard method of american public health association proteins were extracted from both biofilm and bulk liquid of anmbrs on day 65 using the protocol suggested for the extraction of extracellular lipases by both gessesse et al 2003 and frølund et al 1996 the extracted proteins were quantified by pierce modified lowry protein assay kit thermo fisher scientific prior to precipitation by the phenol chloroform method wessel and flügge 1984 precipitated proteins were solubilized and reduced in laemmli buffer and β mercaptoethanol sonicated 20 min cool temperature and heated 5 min 60 c before being run on one dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for 5 min at 120 v bio rad mini protean the gel was stained following the protocol of bio safe coomassie brilliant blue g 250 and was destained overnight details in supplementary file 1 in gel digestion and mass spectrometry were done at newcastle university protein proteome analysis centre using ab sciex tripletof 6600 mass spectrometer following the protocol detailed in the supplementary file 1 mass spectrometric raw data were converted to mgf files using msconvert and analysed as a single group using peaks studio x using a high performance computing windows workstation the metagenomics protein sequence database was cleaned for sequence redundancy and annotation errors using cd hit and notepad furthermore the database search using the cleaned metagenomics constructed database was performed using a two round search strategy the initial search allowed 50 ppm parent ion and 0 1 da fragment mass error tolerance and carbamidomethylation as fixed modification protein matches of the initial search with a 10lgp protein score greater or equal 20 were collected which resulted in a preliminary search output of 11 814 protein groups the second round search using the refined database from the first round search allowed up to 3 missed cleavages 50 ppm parent ion and 0 1 da fragment mass error tolerance carbamidomethylation as fixed modification oxidation and deamidation as variable modifications and employed a decoy fusion database for determining false discovery rates peptide spectrum matches were filtered against 1 or 5 false discovery rates fdr and protein identifications with 2 or more unique peptides across the group were considered as significant matches processing of metadata was done using matlab 2017b additional taxonomic and kegg number annotations was performed using ghostkoala v2 2 the mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the

reads contigs mags the highest and the lowest number of reads belonged to the liquid phase of the sterile feed at 4 c 100 million and 15 c 64 million respectively supplementary file 2 table s2 there was statistically significant difference in the number of reads in the biofilm and liquid tukey pairwise comparison p value 0 402 we found about 1 million m contigs with a total length of nearly 1 5 billion base pair bp the largest contig was about 1 mbp long supplementary file 2 table s3 we recovered about 1519 mags however only 40 mags had at least one putative lipase genes and met the accepted quality threshold to be selected as putative lipolytic mags supplementary file 2 table s4 3 2 lipolytic potential whole metagenome vs mags within the metagenomic data a total of 903 sequences had putative lipolytic activity ec number 3 1 1 3 of which only 78 were present in putative lipolytic mags see table 1 by contrast there were numerous genes coding for the extracellular enzymes that degrade proteins carbohydrates short chain lipids and phosphates in both the whole metagenome and putative lipolytic mags respectively the ccr regulatory system for selecting the most suitable carbon source is aligned with the economic theories allison and vitousek 2005 in the presence of simple substrates cells do not invest carbon and nitrogen for producing extracellular enzymes that decompose complex substrates however where carbon and nitrogen resources exist in complex form producing the relevant enzymes becomes inexpensive allison and vitousek 2005 in the case of lipases where glucose is abundant ccr depresses the lipase production boekema et al 2007 in addition the expression of proteases affects the lipase production andersson 1980 black and dirusso 2003 in bacillus subtills for example the accumulation of amino acids induced the cells to produce more proteases and depress the lipase expression three most frequently annotated genes for degrading sugars in the whole metagenome were β galactosidase β glucosidase and α galactosidase however in the putative lipolytic mags β glucosidase β hexosaminidase cellulase α amylase α galactosidase and endo β xylanase were the most annotated the large difference in the number of the genes can indicate that cells might have various alternative gene regulatory systems for expressing the genes which are involved in degrading sugars rather than lipases bacteria have a global regulatory mechanism known as carbon catabolite repression ccr in the presence of easily accessible carbon sources like sugars ccr inhibits the expression of genes that allow cells to use a secondary carbon source görke and stülke 2008 one of the key genes in this process is catabolite repression resistance gene known as the phosphotransferase system sugar specific eii component pts eii or putative sugar kinases these genes were present in all putative lipolytic mags supplementary file 2 table s5 the ccr regulatory system for selecting the most suitable carbon source is aligned with the economic theories allison and vitousek 2005 in the presence of simple substrates cells do not invest carbon and nitrogen for producing extracellular enzymes that decompose complex substrates however where carbon and nitrogen resources exist in complex form producing the relevant enzymes becomes inexpensive allison and vitousek 2005 in the case of lipases where glucose is abundant ccr depresses the lipase production boekema et al 2007 in addition the expression of proteases affects the lipase production andersson 1980 black and dirusso 2003 in bacillus subtills for example the accumulation of amino acids induced the cells to produce more proteases and depress the lipase expression 3 3 which are the lipolytic mags and why they have lipases putative lipolytic mags belonged to 14 distinct phyla mostly from the actinobacteria proteobacteria and bacteroidota with two unclassified at the phyla level fig 1 some of the putative lipase genes were found from genera we did not expect to be lipolytic or indeed in anaerobic reactors such as aerobic autotrophs we have classified the putative lipolytic mags into three categories i a possible mag with a lipase gene but no fadl gene to transport long chain fatty acids ii a true lipid degrader a mag with both lipase and fadl genes and iii a miscellaneous lipid degrader a mag that degrades lipids for other purposes like denitrification polyhydroxyalkanoates phas accumulation degradation or invasion of other bacteria s outer membrane supplementary file 2 table s6 the fourth possibility is that these are mis assemblies or mis annotations even high quality mags can be subjected to these misinterpretations we could not label any mag with certainty as a possible or true lipid degrader due to both non universality of fadl gene and mis assembly mis annotation possibility for gram positive bacteria still no universal known long chain fatty acid transporter protein like the fadl in gram negatives is characterised salvador lópez and van bogaert 2021 hence we could not decide which of the putative gram positive lipolytic mags 13 from the phylum actinobacteria and 2 from the firmicutes a are a true lipid degrader also in putative gram negative lipolytic mags only 2 out of 18 bin 967 and bin 1501 respectively represented rhodoferax and an unclassified genus from syntrophorhabdia class in desulfobacterota phylum had both lipase and fadl gene the absence of fadl in the rest of the 16 mags might be because of the mis assembly and mis annotation additionally we assumed the co presence of lipases and other genes in the mag like the essential denitrification genes or genes required for synthesizing or degrading phas might be a sign of miscellaneous lipid degrader one of the most curious lipolytic mags was bin 22 a possible nitrosomonas the presence of lipase gene in this genome seemed redundant as nitrosomonas are aerobic nitrifiers and classically utilize carbon dioxide as a carbon source however some species like nitrosomonas europaea are facultative anaerobes and some have even shown denitrification activity under anaerobic conditions the link between lipolysis and denitrification has been shown in some studies denitrifying bacteria utilize long chain fatty acids in the absence of light in anaerobic reactors mackie et al 1991 and anaerobic denitrifiers like acidovorax caeni sp nov have lipase activity heylen et al 2008 besides pha production degradation is linked to lipolysis as well bacteria that accumulate pha either produce lipases to degrade oily substrates and obtain carbon to store pha tufail et al 2017 or degrade the intracellular pha when the carbon is limited mitra et al 2020 nitrosomonas have been proposed as a pha producing bacterium yang et al 2013 previous reports have suggested that many bacteria including denitrifiers produce lipases rather than polymerases to degrade phas though the reason is not known chu and wang 2017 jaeger et al 1995 muhammadi et al 2015 sharma et al 2019 wang and chu 2016 we hypothesized that either anaerobic condition or the presence of pha or other bacteria might induce the lipase expression the assimilation of long chain fatty acids such as palmitic acid in anaerobic conditions represses ammonia oxidation activity of nitrifiers juliette et al 1995 the presence of global nitrogen regulatory gene ntca which existed in bin 22 can activate the assimilation of other nitrogen sources if ammonium nh4 is absent lee et al 1999 also when nitrosomonas sp is79 was co cultured with nitrobacter winogradskyi the abundance of periplasmic lipases in its proteome increased sedlacek et al 2016 one possible explanation for the presence of lipase in the bin 22 therefore might be that it represents an uncharacterised facultative nitrosomonas species that use the lipase for denitrification and pha production degradation topologically the closest species to bin 22 was nitrosomonas sp003201565 supplementary file 2 table s7 deposited in the protein database of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi as nitrosomonas sp nm84 accession number qjjp01000015 this genome from a pure culture not only had the lipase and fadl genes but like bin 22 it contained the essential denitrification genes including nirk copper containing nitrite reductase norb and norc nitric oxide subunit b and c braker et al 2000 torregrosa crespo et al 2017 however they both lacked the pha synthesising genes on the other hand 13 putative lipolytic mags from phyla proteobacteria and actinobacteria had either only pha synthesizing genes e g phac or both pha synthesizing and denitrification genes supplementary file 2 table s6 therefore we assumed that bin 22 might use the lipase for degrading the pha produced by other bacteria from these two phyla for denitrification similarly the other 10 mags from several phyla that only had denitrification and lipase genes no pha synthesising genes might use the lipase for degrading the pha produced by others furthermore we have searched for potential genes involved in the export of lipases to the extracellular medium in bin 22 to validate the presence of lipase genes gram negative bacteria use both type i and type ii secretion system for exporting lipases ahn et al 1999 hausmann and jaeger 2010 type i secretion pathway usually involves the expression of atp binding cassette abc transporters consisted of abc proteins membrane fusion proteins mfp and outer membrane proteins omp at the upstream of the lipase gene in addition to this the lipase gene itself should contain several conserved glycine rich motifs of ggxgxd g glycine x any amino acid d aspartic acid known as lard lipase abc transporter recognition domain at the c terminal chung et al 2009 nonetheless none of the aforementioned exports genes or motifs were found in bin 22 or in the associated public genome of nitrosomonas sp nm84 only one of the related lipases accession number pxw86082 in the public genome had the motifs at the c terminal there were also 16 lipase containing mags those with known genus were all facultative anaerobes that had no denitrification nor pha synthesizing genes for most of them we do not know what the exact role of lipases is for example chlorobium in bin 803 are photosynthetic green sulphur reducing bacteria this mag however had both dark operative protochlorophyllide reductase bchl and light harvesting antenna chlorosomes csma genes that enable chlorobium to survive at extremely low light conditions frigaard et al 2003 two chlorobium species in ncbi had also lipase genes but no fadl genes including chlorobium limicola accession number kul20464 and chlorobium phaeobacteroides dsm 26 accession number abl66324 desulfobacter postgatei bin 481 a sulphate reducing bacteria in ncbi had fadl gene but no lipase gene we do not know whether or not this bacterium is a cheater but uptake of long chain fatty acids and improved lipid degradation have been confirmed for other sulphate reducers alves et al 2020 florentino et al 2020 3 4 linking the putative lipolytic mags to the reactor conditions and lipases for most putative lipolytic mags the number of mapped reads per reactor conditions did not vary significantly however for a few mags statistically significant differences were observed supplementary file 2 table s8 and figs s1 s3 for instance considering only the effect of temperature at 4 c only bin 803 chlorobium and at 15 c bin 328 unclassified ga0077546 from cyanobacteria bin 231 unassigned from chloroflexota bin 154 unassigned from hydrogenedentota and bin 609 unclassified fen 1322 from omnitrophota had noticeably higher number of mapped reads about 55 of the lipases were in mags from the phylum actinobacteriota of which half distributed within two genera mycolicibacterium and corynebacterium both genera existed at both temperatures treatment and phase though the latter was slightly but not statistically significant higher in the liquid phase supplementary file 2 table s9 regardless of their class taxonomy lipases from the different mags were significantly different in length pairwise tukey test p value 0 002 one way anova pairwise tukey test p value 0 467 on the length of individual lipases per phylum showed that actinobacteriota had both the largest 819 aa and the shortest 180 aa lipases in addition the highest and the lowest average length of the lipases were within the phyla actinobacteriota 399 aa and omnitrophota 220 aa respectively fig 2 3 5 the putative lipolytic mags abundance in the reactors there were 32 common and abundant relative abundance 1 bacterial genera in at least one reactor conditions fig 3 for most the effect of temperature and treatment on relative abundance was insignificant supplementary file 2 fig s4 however bifidobacterium and desulfobacter were more abundant at 4 c and 15 c respectively similarly a significant effect of treatment was noticeable among the sterile and non sterile fed reactors for bifidobacterium streptococcus acidovorax and cloacibacterium the first two were higher in non sterile conditions whereas the second two were the highest at the sterile conditions only three of the putative lipolytic mags desulfobacter chlorobium and mycolicibacterium were both common and abundant 1 in most reactors chlorobium and mycolicibacterium only had more than 1 abundance at non sterile and sterile conditions respectively fig 3 the rest of the genera identified in mags had either very low relative abundance corynebacterium lentimicrobium nitrosomonas paracoccus and rhodoferax or they were not represented in the reactors austwickia propionicimonas and rhodoluna fig 4 3 6 expressed proteins a total of 93 and 117 distinct protein groups were found at false detection rates fdr of 1 and 5 respectively as listed in supplementary file 2 table s10 using the complete metagenomics constructed database at fdr 5 there were 24 new protein groups compared to fdr 1 though neither of the new or common hits were significantly different p value 0 514 one way anova not only were none of the hits lipases none were hydrolytic enzymes of any description either jachlewski et al 2015 also discussed that no extracellular enzymes were identifiable in the eps of thermophilic archaeal cell culture by proteomics due to low quantity of enzymes in the eps about 75 of the identified proteins were involved in processing the genetic information signalling and cellular processes processing environmental information and energy metabolism further 4 2 and 1 of the proteins were related to carbohydrate amino acids and lipid metabolism respectively fig 5 in terms of class outer membrane porin proteins omp32 outnumbered the rest of the classes 25 and after them in descending order there were vitamin b12 transporters btub tonb dependent starch binding receptors susc and major outer membrane proteins p ia pora we detected several porins abc transporters like lamb maltoporin and fadl long chain fatty acid transporters and the latter is of particular interest the expression of fadl might be related to the expression of lipases we assumed that cells would only invest on expressing fadl genes when expressed lipases had already released long chain fatty acids from the lipidic molecules several cytoplasmic proteins were present including groel 60 kda chaperonin tufa elongation factor tu fusa elongation factor g rpsa 30s ribosomal protein s1 rpsc 30s ribosomal protein s3 rpse 30s ribosomal protein s5 rpsg 30s ribosomal protein s7 and rpsp 30s ribosomal protein s16 the presence of these proteins in the extracellular polymeric substances eps is related to either the presence of extracellular vesicles in the eps or cell lysis that happens during the biofilm maturation jachlewski et al 2015 therefore we profiled several proteins that are typically found in the extracellular vesicles these proteins were outer membrane proteins and porins ompa ompw ompx ompf pora and porb proteins that release toxic compounds and attack the competing bacteria acra or multidrug efflux pump subunit nutrient sensors and transporters that carry certain molecules under nutrient limited conditions like abc transporters fadl lamb btub and tonb dependent receptors susc particularly the presence of fadl genes in the extracellular vesicles is interesting they were frequently found as the top 50 vesicular proteins in gram negative bacteria lee et al 2016 nonetheless their exact role and why they are there is yet to be known 3 7 taxonomical distribution of identified proteins by metaproteomics about 97 of the identified expressed genes at fdr 5 were related to the bacterial domain and at least from 19 distinct classes fig 6 a among which betaproteobacteria had the greatest share 57 the top ranked identified genera with expressed proteins were all from the class betaproteobacteria including paucimonas dechloromonas acidovorax azoarcus and thauera respectively fig 6berror reference source not found the full list of all genera associated to the expressed proteins is presented in supplementary file 2 table s11 among the top ranked all genera except for paucimonas have been formerly identified by gottcha2 and their relative abundance in each reactor was known fig 7 comparatively azoarcus was the only low abundant genus with no abundance at non sterile 4 c although paucimonas was absent from the reactors based on gottcha2 it had the highest number of protein matches supplementary file 2 table s12 with most of them being ribosomal proteins or involved in energy metabolism one porin and one outer membrane protein were present too by contrast 68 of the related proteins to other genera were porins and outer membrane proteins supplementary file 2 figure s5 additionally both dechloromonas and azoarcus had fadl and thus were potentially lipolytic expressed fadl was also found in two other genera not among the top ranked aeromonas and sulfurimonas their relative abundance is presented in fig 7 azoarcus and sulfurimonas were low abundant in all conditions whereas aeromonas had higher relative abundance 1 at non sterile 15 c the expression of fadl in dechloromonas azoarcus aeromonas and sulfurimonas might imply the presence of long chain fatty acids in the system and therefore can be a proxy for lipolysis performed by these genera or others however none of these four genera were recovered as putative lipolytic mags by metagenomics the absence of lipases along with the presence of fadl genes in a genome might be indicative of cheating mechanisms nonetheless the complete genome of these four genera in ncbi had both the fadl and lipase genes while this might remove the cheating label from these genera it does not necessarily make them true lipase producers either we do not know whether or not fadl and lipases are coregulated but we do know that both can be exported through extracellular vesicles in gram negative and gram positive bacteria galka et al 2008 lee et al 2009 lee et al 2016 the presence of both fadl and lipases in the extracellular vesicles might have an entirely different reason than the lipolysis of exogenous lipid molecules for instance galka et al 2008 have shown that pathogens transport lipases as a virulence factors through extracellular vesicles to attack the lipidic membrane of the host cell and deliver lipids to them the same scenario might apply to bacterial cells interaction but no study has shown this yet 3 8 identified proteins of abundant genera out of the 32 common bacterial genera with relative abundance of more than 1 fig 3 metaproteomics identified proteins expressed by 15 of them table 2 more than half 55 of the proteins were outer membrane proteins and porins some of these genera accumulate lipids e g polyhydroxyalkanoates phas or perform denitrification lipid accumulation is a barrier for lipid degradation in wastewater systems chipasa and mdrzycka 2008 and cold temperature is a stimulator for pha accumulation srivastava et al 2020 at least six of the identified genera acinetobacter cloacibacterium dechloromonas rhodopseudomonas thauera and thermomonas are involved in pha accumulation carlozzi and sacchi 2001 coats et al 2016 hauschild et al 2017 oshiki et al 2008 ram et al 2018 singleton et al 2021 however dechloromonas was the only genus that had expressed fadl gene but had no lipases this genus has been identified as an anaerobic denitrifier too singleton et al 2021 the identified norc and actp cation acetate symporter proteins for this genus confirm its denitrification activity and competition with methanogens to assimilate acetate table 2 since the complete genome of dechloromonas denitrificans in ncbi had lipase fadl and phac genes accession numbers respectively kxb32756 and kxb32487 we assumed that the identified fadl of dechloromonas might indicate of its lipolytic activity related to pha accumulation and denitrification also the presence of sulphur reducing bacteria sulfuricurvum table 2 along with the sulphate reducers e g desulfobacter has been associated with the occurrence of internal sulphur cycle in the system st james and richardson 2020 although desulfobacter was not identified by metaproteomics it was recovered as a good lipolytic mag and had high abundance at all reactor conditions fig 3 sulphate reduction limits pha accumulation and sulphate reducers in the absence of sulphate can switch to syntrophic and fermentative metabolisms st james and richardson 2020 overall the combination of metagenomics and metaproteomics failed to identify true lipolytic psychrophiles in the anmbrs with the described operational conditions although biomarkers like fadl gene were found by metaproteomics the absence of lipases in the analysed metaproteome prevented any clear conclusion none of the recovered putative lipolytic mags were among the taxa found by metaproteomics therefore we could not determine which cold adapted microorganism is a true lipid degrader and which might use the lipase for miscellaneous purposes like the pha accumulation degradation denitrification or invasion future studies can therefore investigate how lipolysis and pha accumulation degradation are linked and why and when microbes might use lipases rather than pha polymerases for more conclusive results we suggest that some barriers need to be removed by different research disciplines we can reduce the effect of false positive results in the assembly and annotation steps of metagenomics by integrating both short and long sequenced reads in metaproteomics on the other hand we need to develop universal unbiased extraction methods particularly for extracellular enzymes which are more sensitive characterising the extracellular vesicle proteins and differentiating them from the eps proteins is another important issue some extracellular proteins like lipases can be present in both location but cells regulate them for different purposes this can be checked by using synthetic biology techniques that enable determination of the gene regulation mechanisms and the extracellular excretion pathways employing high resolution mass spectrometers along with developing better tools for identifying the mass spectra and matching them to protein groups can also enhance metaproteomics data analysis besides the dependency of metaproteomics to metagenomics database can be reduced through de novo approaches and finally developing chemical probes that can react with lipases which enable us to use activity based protein profiling and quantitative metaproteomics approaches for detecting extracellular lipases 4 conclusion results obtained by metagenomics and metaproteomics did not confirm each other and extracellular lipases and lipolytic bacteria were not easily identifiable by these tools in anmbr reactors operated for more than three years at 4 and 15 c treating domestic wastewater using pschycrophilic microbial community soils and sediment from arctic as inoculum 40 putative lipolytic mags were recovered from the metagenomics data of all reactors extremely lower number of lipases compared to other hydrolytic extracellular enzymes were found within the metagenomes lipolysis may not always occur exogenously lipolysis molecules may be linked to pha accumulation degradation denitrification and invasion most lipases were from phyla actinobacteria and genera mycolicibacterium and corynebacterium that accumulate phas of the 32 common abundant genera in all reactors relative abundance 1 only three chlorobium desulfobacter and mycolicibacterium were recovered as putative lipolytic mags with few exceptions there was no significant correlation between the reactor conditions and the number of reads mapped to the putative lipolytic mags out of the 32 common genera profiled by metagenomics 15 were identified by metaproteomics too at least 6 of them were involved in lipid pha accumulation metaproteomics identified fadl genes for four genera dechloromonas azoarcus aeromonas and sulfurimonas but did not identify any lipases for them also none of these four genera were recovered as putative lipolytic mags by metagenomics the proteins identified by metaproteomics were mainly porins and outer membrane proteins and some cytoplasmic proteins were identified too that might enter the eps through extracellular vesicles declaration of competing interest the authors

16264,poor lipid degradation limits low temperature anaerobic treatment of domestic wastewater even when psychrophiles are used we combined metagenomics and metaproteomics to find lipolytic bacteria and their potential and actual cold adapted extracellular lipases in anaerobic membrane bioreactors treating domestic wastewater at 4 and 15 c of the 40 recovered putative lipolytic metagenome assembled genomes mags only three chlorobium desulfobacter and mycolicibacterium were common and abundant relative abundance 1 in all reactors notably some mags that represented aerobic autotrophs contained lipases therefore we hypothesised that the lipases we found are not always associated with exogenous lipid degradation and can have other roles such as polyhydroxyalkanoates pha accumulation degradation and interference with the outer membranes of other bacteria metaproteomics did not provide sufficient proteome coverage for relatively lower abundant proteins such as lipases though the expression of fadl genes long chain fatty acid transporters was confirmed for four genera dechloromonas azoarcus aeromonas and sulfurimonas none of which were recovered as putative lipolytic mags metaproteomics also confirmed the presence of 15 relatively abundant 1 genera in all reactors of which at least 6 can potentially accumulate lipid polyhydroxyalkanoates for most putative lipolytic mags there was no statistically significant correlation between the read abundance and reactor conditions such as temperature phase biofilm and bulk liquid and feed type treated by ultraviolet light or not results obtained by metagenomics and metaproteomics did not confirm each other and extracellular lipases and lipolytic bacteria were not easily identifiable in the anaerobic membrane reactors

introduction anaerobic treatment of domestic wastewater generates energy and produces much less sludge than the conventional activated sludge process however it is still rarely adopted at full scale outside of south america aquino et al 2019 where the reactors work well at ambient temperatures 23 34 c therefore for 60 of the world population that lives in countries with a temperate climate using anaerobic treatment for treating domestic wastewater is problematic the major limitation is related to the first step in anaerobic digestion hydrolysis in this step fermentative bacteria degrade large biopolymers like carbohydrates proteins and lipids presumably by producing extracellular enzymes yet at low temperatures the rate of biological reactions drops and hydrolysis becomes rate limiting lipids degrade more slowly than carbohydrates or proteins at low temperatures forming the bulk of the chemical oxygen demand cod in the effluents petropoulos et al 2018 and a lipid rich scum layer in the reactors soares et al 2019 operational interventions such as a skimmer to remove the scum layer lettinga et al 1984 may help but do not address the fundamental issues of compliance or energy recovery the estimated methane yield from 1 g glycerol trioleate an abundant natural lipid is 1 08 l at standard temperature and pressure while for 1 g glucose this is only 0 37 l kim and shin 2010 at bench pilot scale it is possible to treat domestic wastewater anaerobically at ambient temperatures and as low as 4 c in different bioreactor configuration kong et al 2021 lim et al 2019 maleki et al 2019 mcateer et al 2020 petropoulos et al 2017 2018 2021 2019 ribera pi et al 2020 yang et al 2020 baffled or multi compartment reactors benefit the rate limiting hydrolysis step by providing longer retention time these reactors have shown good cod removal performance at low temperatures by using mesophilic biomass hahn and figueroa 2015 pfluger et al 2018a pfluger et al 2018b however there is no evidence to show to what extent these reactors can remove lipids lipids remained undegraded unlike carbohydrates and proteins even when the psychrophilic microbial community is used to treat domestic wastewater anaerobically at 4 8 and 15 c in anmbrs petropoulos et al 2018 a lipolytic organism must be able to produce extracellular lipases to degrade lipids and then transport the long chain fatty acids back into the cell to be metabolised for example by the beta oxidation pathway due to the difference of the cell wall structure in gram negative and gram positive bacteria the export of lipases and import of long chain fatty acids may differ for instance in gram negative bacteria long chain fatty acid transporter proteins fadl have been identified for carrying the long chain fatty acids to the cells however such transporters have not yet been identified for the gram positive bacteria salvador lópez and van bogaert 2021 but presumably exist poor lipid degradation at low temperatures could be due to a lack of lipase production a lack of lipase activity low rates of fatty acid transport or a slow beta oxidation pathway understanding these limitations would be easier if we knew the identity of the lipolytic bacteria and ideally any accompanying cheaters bacteria that consume long chain fatty acids without producing lipases the present study therefore aims to investigate the lipolytic potential of the psychrophilic bacteria adapted to treat domestic wastewater anaerobically at 4 and 15 c we combined molecular biology tools such as metagenomics and metaproteomics to find potential and actual expressed lipase genes or other lipolytic biomarkers like fadl genes as well as lipase producers and cheaters 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor description and sampling four anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs and their duplicates 1l working volume were developed to operate at 4 and 15 c with cold adapted biomass these working temperatures were selected based on the previous study published by petropoulos et al 2017 schematic diagram of the reactors and the details about biomass acclimation feed operational conditions and reactors performance are included in supplementary file 1 in brief the reactors were inoculated by putative psychrophilic biomass collected from the sediment and soils of lake geneva n 46 23 04 e 6 25 07 switzerland annual minimum and maximum temperature 11 and 21 c and svalbard n 78 e 11 15 16 norway annual minimum and maximum temperature 16 and 6 c respectively primary domestic influent collected from an activated sludge plant tudhoe mill county durham uk was used as a feed the feed was introduced into the reactors either as sterile treated with ultraviolet light to exclude mesophilic biomass of the feed or non sterile the psychrophilic biomass was acclimated to both the operating temperatures 4 and 15 c and feed types as described by petropoulos et al 2017 2019 2021 through series of batch and continuous experiments which lasted for more than three years in this study we re acclimated the reactors for two months hydraulic retention time was 60 h and sampled from both the bulk liquid and biofilm formed on the membrane on day 65 when the reactors were working at the steady state at the above mentioned operational conditions 2 2 metagenomics and data analysis dna was extracted from the anmbrs samples both from the bulk liquid and biofilm formed on the membrane at day 65 using the ctab method griffiths et al 2000 and sent for sequencing hiseq 2500 platform to the earlham institute norwich amplification free illumina compatible libraries were constructed using the kapa hyper prep kit aliquots of each samples were run on two lanes two flowcells to generate paired end pe 250 reads of about 300 mb fastqc v0 11 5 was employed to check the quality of reads and cutadapt v1 18 and trimmomatic v0 36 were used to trim the adapters and poor regions removed parts from the read 1 were agatcggaagagcacacgtctgaactccagtca and from the read 2 were agatcggaagagcgtcgtgtagggaaagagtgt respectively filtered reads were co assembled with megahit v 1 2 9 using a high performance computer at newcastle university obtained contigs were then binned with metabat2 v1 7 to recover the metagenome assembled genomes mags to evaluate the quality of the bins checkm v1 0 18 was used and mags with more than 90 completeness and less than 10 contamination were selected as putative lipolytic bins the fasta file of the selected mags were uploaded to kbase arkin et al 2018 and annotated using prokka v1 12 after annotation lipase genes were searched with their ec number 3 1 1 3 mags that had at least one putative lipase gene were specified as putative lipolytic bins specific ec numbers of other hydrolytic enzymes like phosphatases proteases esterases and carbohydrate degraders were also searched supplementary file 2 table s1 further analysis like the taxonomic classification was performed by gtdb tk v0 3 2 on the putative lipolytic mags at kbase to find the relative abundance of the microorganisms existing at each reactor condition reads from both biofilm and liquid phase of the replicate reactors at each temperature and treatment set up were merged with kbase apps and were analysed with gottcha2 v2 1 5 all statistical analysis was performed using minitab 18 all metagenomics data are accessible at european nucleotide archive ena under the accession number prjeb47041 2 3 metaproteomics and data analysis before protein extraction volatile suspended solid vss was measured following the standard method of american public health association proteins were extracted from both biofilm and bulk liquid of anmbrs on day 65 using the protocol suggested for the extraction of extracellular lipases by both gessesse et al 2003 and frølund et al 1996 the extracted proteins were quantified by pierce modified lowry protein assay kit thermo fisher scientific prior to precipitation by the phenol chloroform method wessel and flügge 1984 precipitated proteins were solubilized and reduced in laemmli buffer and β mercaptoethanol sonicated 20 min cool temperature and heated 5 min 60 c before being run on one dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for 5 min at 120 v bio rad mini protean the gel was stained following the protocol of bio safe coomassie brilliant blue g 250 and was destained overnight details in supplementary file 1 in gel digestion and mass spectrometry were done at newcastle university protein proteome analysis centre using ab sciex tripletof 6600 mass spectrometer following the protocol detailed in the supplementary file 1 mass spectrometric raw data were converted to mgf files using msconvert and analysed as a single group using peaks studio x using a high performance computing windows workstation the metagenomics protein sequence database was cleaned for sequence redundancy and annotation errors using cd hit and notepad furthermore the database search using the cleaned metagenomics constructed database was performed using a two round search strategy the initial search allowed 50 ppm parent ion and 0 1 da fragment mass error tolerance and carbamidomethylation as fixed modification protein matches of the initial search with a 10lgp protein score greater or equal 20 were collected which resulted in a preliminary search output of 11 814 protein groups the second round search using the refined database from the first round search allowed up to 3 missed cleavages 50 ppm parent ion and 0 1 da fragment mass error tolerance carbamidomethylation as fixed modification oxidation and deamidation as variable modifications and employed a decoy fusion database for determining false discovery rates peptide spectrum matches were filtered against 1 or 5 false discovery rates fdr and protein identifications with 2 or more unique peptides across the group were considered as significant matches processing of metadata was done using matlab 2017b additional taxonomic and kegg number annotations was performed using ghostkoala v2 2 the mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the

reads contigs mags the highest and the lowest number of reads belonged to the liquid phase of the sterile feed at 4 c 100 million and 15 c 64 million respectively supplementary file 2 table s2 there was statistically significant difference in the number of reads in the biofilm and liquid tukey pairwise comparison p value 0 402 we found about 1 million m contigs with a total length of nearly 1 5 billion base pair bp the largest contig was about 1 mbp long supplementary file 2 table s3 we recovered about 1519 mags however only 40 mags had at least one putative lipase genes and met the accepted quality threshold to be selected as putative lipolytic mags supplementary file 2 table s4 3 2 lipolytic potential whole metagenome vs mags within the metagenomic data a total of 903 sequences had putative lipolytic activity ec number 3 1 1 3 of which only 78 were present in putative lipolytic mags see table 1 by contrast there were numerous genes coding for the extracellular enzymes that degrade proteins carbohydrates short chain lipids and phosphates in both the whole metagenome and putative lipolytic mags respectively the ccr regulatory system for selecting the most suitable carbon source is aligned with the economic theories allison and vitousek 2005 in the presence of simple substrates cells do not invest carbon and nitrogen for producing extracellular enzymes that decompose complex substrates however where carbon and nitrogen resources exist in complex form producing the relevant enzymes becomes inexpensive allison and vitousek 2005 in the case of lipases where glucose is abundant ccr depresses the lipase production boekema et al 2007 in addition the expression of proteases affects the lipase production andersson 1980 black and dirusso 2003 in bacillus subtills for example the accumulation of amino acids induced the cells to produce more proteases and depress the lipase expression three most frequently annotated genes for degrading sugars in the whole metagenome were β galactosidase β glucosidase and α galactosidase however in the putative lipolytic mags β glucosidase β hexosaminidase cellulase α amylase α galactosidase and endo β xylanase were the most annotated the large difference in the number of the genes can indicate that cells might have various alternative gene regulatory systems for expressing the genes which are involved in degrading sugars rather than lipases bacteria have a global regulatory mechanism known as carbon catabolite repression ccr in the presence of easily accessible carbon sources like sugars ccr inhibits the expression of genes that allow cells to use a secondary carbon source görke and stülke 2008 one of the key genes in this process is catabolite repression resistance gene known as the phosphotransferase system sugar specific eii component pts eii or putative sugar kinases these genes were present in all putative lipolytic mags supplementary file 2 table s5 the ccr regulatory system for selecting the most suitable carbon source is aligned with the economic theories allison and vitousek 2005 in the presence of simple substrates cells do not invest carbon and nitrogen for producing extracellular enzymes that decompose complex substrates however where carbon and nitrogen resources exist in complex form producing the relevant enzymes becomes inexpensive allison and vitousek 2005 in the case of lipases where glucose is abundant ccr depresses the lipase production boekema et al 2007 in addition the expression of proteases affects the lipase production andersson 1980 black and dirusso 2003 in bacillus subtills for example the accumulation of amino acids induced the cells to produce more proteases and depress the lipase expression 3 3 which are the lipolytic mags and why they have lipases putative lipolytic mags belonged to 14 distinct phyla mostly from the actinobacteria proteobacteria and bacteroidota with two unclassified at the phyla level fig 1 some of the putative lipase genes were found from genera we did not expect to be lipolytic or indeed in anaerobic reactors such as aerobic autotrophs we have classified the putative lipolytic mags into three categories i a possible mag with a lipase gene but no fadl gene to transport long chain fatty acids ii a true lipid degrader a mag with both lipase and fadl genes and iii a miscellaneous lipid degrader a mag that degrades lipids for other purposes like denitrification polyhydroxyalkanoates phas accumulation degradation or invasion of other bacteria s outer membrane supplementary file 2 table s6 the fourth possibility is that these are mis assemblies or mis annotations even high quality mags can be subjected to these misinterpretations we could not label any mag with certainty as a possible or true lipid degrader due to both non universality of fadl gene and mis assembly mis annotation possibility for gram positive bacteria still no universal known long chain fatty acid transporter protein like the fadl in gram negatives is characterised salvador lópez and van bogaert 2021 hence we could not decide which of the putative gram positive lipolytic mags 13 from the phylum actinobacteria and 2 from the firmicutes a are a true lipid degrader also in putative gram negative lipolytic mags only 2 out of 18 bin 967 and bin 1501 respectively represented rhodoferax and an unclassified genus from syntrophorhabdia class in desulfobacterota phylum had both lipase and fadl gene the absence of fadl in the rest of the 16 mags might be because of the mis assembly and mis annotation additionally we assumed the co presence of lipases and other genes in the mag like the essential denitrification genes or genes required for synthesizing or degrading phas might be a sign of miscellaneous lipid degrader one of the most curious lipolytic mags was bin 22 a possible nitrosomonas the presence of lipase gene in this genome seemed redundant as nitrosomonas are aerobic nitrifiers and classically utilize carbon dioxide as a carbon source however some species like nitrosomonas europaea are facultative anaerobes and some have even shown denitrification activity under anaerobic conditions the link between lipolysis and denitrification has been shown in some studies denitrifying bacteria utilize long chain fatty acids in the absence of light in anaerobic reactors mackie et al 1991 and anaerobic denitrifiers like acidovorax caeni sp nov have lipase activity heylen et al 2008 besides pha production degradation is linked to lipolysis as well bacteria that accumulate pha either produce lipases to degrade oily substrates and obtain carbon to store pha tufail et al 2017 or degrade the intracellular pha when the carbon is limited mitra et al 2020 nitrosomonas have been proposed as a pha producing bacterium yang et al 2013 previous reports have suggested that many bacteria including denitrifiers produce lipases rather than polymerases to degrade phas though the reason is not known chu and wang 2017 jaeger et al 1995 muhammadi et al 2015 sharma et al 2019 wang and chu 2016 we hypothesized that either anaerobic condition or the presence of pha or other bacteria might induce the lipase expression the assimilation of long chain fatty acids such as palmitic acid in anaerobic conditions represses ammonia oxidation activity of nitrifiers juliette et al 1995 the presence of global nitrogen regulatory gene ntca which existed in bin 22 can activate the assimilation of other nitrogen sources if ammonium nh4 is absent lee et al 1999 also when nitrosomonas sp is79 was co cultured with nitrobacter winogradskyi the abundance of periplasmic lipases in its proteome increased sedlacek et al 2016 one possible explanation for the presence of lipase in the bin 22 therefore might be that it represents an uncharacterised facultative nitrosomonas species that use the lipase for denitrification and pha production degradation topologically the closest species to bin 22 was nitrosomonas sp003201565 supplementary file 2 table s7 deposited in the protein database of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi as nitrosomonas sp nm84 accession number qjjp01000015 this genome from a pure culture not only had the lipase and fadl genes but like bin 22 it contained the essential denitrification genes including nirk copper containing nitrite reductase norb and norc nitric oxide subunit b and c braker et al 2000 torregrosa crespo et al 2017 however they both lacked the pha synthesising genes on the other hand 13 putative lipolytic mags from phyla proteobacteria and actinobacteria had either only pha synthesizing genes e g phac or both pha synthesizing and denitrification genes supplementary file 2 table s6 therefore we assumed that bin 22 might use the lipase for degrading the pha produced by other bacteria from these two phyla for denitrification similarly the other 10 mags from several phyla that only had denitrification and lipase genes no pha synthesising genes might use the lipase for degrading the pha produced by others furthermore we have searched for potential genes involved in the export of lipases to the extracellular medium in bin 22 to validate the presence of lipase genes gram negative bacteria use both type i and type ii secretion system for exporting lipases ahn et al 1999 hausmann and jaeger 2010 type i secretion pathway usually involves the expression of atp binding cassette abc transporters consisted of abc proteins membrane fusion proteins mfp and outer membrane proteins omp at the upstream of the lipase gene in addition to this the lipase gene itself should contain several conserved glycine rich motifs of ggxgxd g glycine x any amino acid d aspartic acid known as lard lipase abc transporter recognition domain at the c terminal chung et al 2009 nonetheless none of the aforementioned exports genes or motifs were found in bin 22 or in the associated public genome of nitrosomonas sp nm84 only one of the related lipases accession number pxw86082 in the public genome had the motifs at the c terminal there were also 16 lipase containing mags those with known genus were all facultative anaerobes that had no denitrification nor pha synthesizing genes for most of them we do not know what the exact role of lipases is for example chlorobium in bin 803 are photosynthetic green sulphur reducing bacteria this mag however had both dark operative protochlorophyllide reductase bchl and light harvesting antenna chlorosomes csma genes that enable chlorobium to survive at extremely low light conditions frigaard et al 2003 two chlorobium species in ncbi had also lipase genes but no fadl genes including chlorobium limicola accession number kul20464 and chlorobium phaeobacteroides dsm 26 accession number abl66324 desulfobacter postgatei bin 481 a sulphate reducing bacteria in ncbi had fadl gene but no lipase gene we do not know whether or not this bacterium is a cheater but uptake of long chain fatty acids and improved lipid degradation have been confirmed for other sulphate reducers alves et al 2020 florentino et al 2020 3 4 linking the putative lipolytic mags to the reactor conditions and lipases for most putative lipolytic mags the number of mapped reads per reactor conditions did not vary significantly however for a few mags statistically significant differences were observed supplementary file 2 table s8 and figs s1 s3 for instance considering only the effect of temperature at 4 c only bin 803 chlorobium and at 15 c bin 328 unclassified ga0077546 from cyanobacteria bin 231 unassigned from chloroflexota bin 154 unassigned from hydrogenedentota and bin 609 unclassified fen 1322 from omnitrophota had noticeably higher number of mapped reads about 55 of the lipases were in mags from the phylum actinobacteriota of which half distributed within two genera mycolicibacterium and corynebacterium both genera existed at both temperatures treatment and phase though the latter was slightly but not statistically significant higher in the liquid phase supplementary file 2 table s9 regardless of their class taxonomy lipases from the different mags were significantly different in length pairwise tukey test p value 0 002 one way anova pairwise tukey test p value 0 467 on the length of individual lipases per phylum showed that actinobacteriota had both the largest 819 aa and the shortest 180 aa lipases in addition the highest and the lowest average length of the lipases were within the phyla actinobacteriota 399 aa and omnitrophota 220 aa respectively fig 2 3 5 the putative lipolytic mags abundance in the reactors there were 32 common and abundant relative abundance 1 bacterial genera in at least one reactor conditions fig 3 for most the effect of temperature and treatment on relative abundance was insignificant supplementary file 2 fig s4 however bifidobacterium and desulfobacter were more abundant at 4 c and 15 c respectively similarly a significant effect of treatment was noticeable among the sterile and non sterile fed reactors for bifidobacterium streptococcus acidovorax and cloacibacterium the first two were higher in non sterile conditions whereas the second two were the highest at the sterile conditions only three of the putative lipolytic mags desulfobacter chlorobium and mycolicibacterium were both common and abundant 1 in most reactors chlorobium and mycolicibacterium only had more than 1 abundance at non sterile and sterile conditions respectively fig 3 the rest of the genera identified in mags had either very low relative abundance corynebacterium lentimicrobium nitrosomonas paracoccus and rhodoferax or they were not represented in the reactors austwickia propionicimonas and rhodoluna fig 4 3 6 expressed proteins a total of 93 and 117 distinct protein groups were found at false detection rates fdr of 1 and 5 respectively as listed in supplementary file 2 table s10 using the complete metagenomics constructed database at fdr 5 there were 24 new protein groups compared to fdr 1 though neither of the new or common hits were significantly different p value 0 514 one way anova not only were none of the hits lipases none were hydrolytic enzymes of any description either jachlewski et al 2015 also discussed that no extracellular enzymes were identifiable in the eps of thermophilic archaeal cell culture by proteomics due to low quantity of enzymes in the eps about 75 of the identified proteins were involved in processing the genetic information signalling and cellular processes processing environmental information and energy metabolism further 4 2 and 1 of the proteins were related to carbohydrate amino acids and lipid metabolism respectively fig 5 in terms of class outer membrane porin proteins omp32 outnumbered the rest of the classes 25 and after them in descending order there were vitamin b12 transporters btub tonb dependent starch binding receptors susc and major outer membrane proteins p ia pora we detected several porins abc transporters like lamb maltoporin and fadl long chain fatty acid transporters and the latter is of particular interest the expression of fadl might be related to the expression of lipases we assumed that cells would only invest on expressing fadl genes when expressed lipases had already released long chain fatty acids from the lipidic molecules several cytoplasmic proteins were present including groel 60 kda chaperonin tufa elongation factor tu fusa elongation factor g rpsa 30s ribosomal protein s1 rpsc 30s ribosomal protein s3 rpse 30s ribosomal protein s5 rpsg 30s ribosomal protein s7 and rpsp 30s ribosomal protein s16 the presence of these proteins in the extracellular polymeric substances eps is related to either the presence of extracellular vesicles in the eps or cell lysis that happens during the biofilm maturation jachlewski et al 2015 therefore we profiled several proteins that are typically found in the extracellular vesicles these proteins were outer membrane proteins and porins ompa ompw ompx ompf pora and porb proteins that release toxic compounds and attack the competing bacteria acra or multidrug efflux pump subunit nutrient sensors and transporters that carry certain molecules under nutrient limited conditions like abc transporters fadl lamb btub and tonb dependent receptors susc particularly the presence of fadl genes in the extracellular vesicles is interesting they were frequently found as the top 50 vesicular proteins in gram negative bacteria lee et al 2016 nonetheless their exact role and why they are there is yet to be known 3 7 taxonomical distribution of identified proteins by metaproteomics about 97 of the identified expressed genes at fdr 5 were related to the bacterial domain and at least from 19 distinct classes fig 6 a among which betaproteobacteria had the greatest share 57 the top ranked identified genera with expressed proteins were all from the class betaproteobacteria including paucimonas dechloromonas acidovorax azoarcus and thauera respectively fig 6berror reference source not found the full list of all genera associated to the expressed proteins is presented in supplementary file 2 table s11 among the top ranked all genera except for paucimonas have been formerly identified by gottcha2 and their relative abundance in each reactor was known fig 7 comparatively azoarcus was the only low abundant genus with no abundance at non sterile 4 c although paucimonas was absent from the reactors based on gottcha2 it had the highest number of protein matches supplementary file 2 table s12 with most of them being ribosomal proteins or involved in energy metabolism one porin and one outer membrane protein were present too by contrast 68 of the related proteins to other genera were porins and outer membrane proteins supplementary file 2 figure s5 additionally both dechloromonas and azoarcus had fadl and thus were potentially lipolytic expressed fadl was also found in two other genera not among the top ranked aeromonas and sulfurimonas their relative abundance is presented in fig 7 azoarcus and sulfurimonas were low abundant in all conditions whereas aeromonas had higher relative abundance 1 at non sterile 15 c the expression of fadl in dechloromonas azoarcus aeromonas and sulfurimonas might imply the presence of long chain fatty acids in the system and therefore can be a proxy for lipolysis performed by these genera or others however none of these four genera were recovered as putative lipolytic mags by metagenomics the absence of lipases along with the presence of fadl genes in a genome might be indicative of cheating mechanisms nonetheless the complete genome of these four genera in ncbi had both the fadl and lipase genes while this might remove the cheating label from these genera it does not necessarily make them true lipase producers either we do not know whether or not fadl and lipases are coregulated but we do know that both can be exported through extracellular vesicles in gram negative and gram positive bacteria galka et al 2008 lee et al 2009 lee et al 2016 the presence of both fadl and lipases in the extracellular vesicles might have an entirely different reason than the lipolysis of exogenous lipid molecules for instance galka et al 2008 have shown that pathogens transport lipases as a virulence factors through extracellular vesicles to attack the lipidic membrane of the host cell and deliver lipids to them the same scenario might apply to bacterial cells interaction but no study has shown this yet 3 8 identified proteins of abundant genera out of the 32 common bacterial genera with relative abundance of more than 1 fig 3 metaproteomics identified proteins expressed by 15 of them table 2 more than half 55 of the proteins were outer membrane proteins and porins some of these genera accumulate lipids e g polyhydroxyalkanoates phas or perform denitrification lipid accumulation is a barrier for lipid degradation in wastewater systems chipasa and mdrzycka 2008 and cold temperature is a stimulator for pha accumulation srivastava et al 2020 at least six of the identified genera acinetobacter cloacibacterium dechloromonas rhodopseudomonas thauera and thermomonas are involved in pha accumulation carlozzi and sacchi 2001 coats et al 2016 hauschild et al 2017 oshiki et al 2008 ram et al 2018 singleton et al 2021 however dechloromonas was the only genus that had expressed fadl gene but had no lipases this genus has been identified as an anaerobic denitrifier too singleton et al 2021 the identified norc and actp cation acetate symporter proteins for this genus confirm its denitrification activity and competition with methanogens to assimilate acetate table 2 since the complete genome of dechloromonas denitrificans in ncbi had lipase fadl and phac genes accession numbers respectively kxb32756 and kxb32487 we assumed that the identified fadl of dechloromonas might indicate of its lipolytic activity related to pha accumulation and denitrification also the presence of sulphur reducing bacteria sulfuricurvum table 2 along with the sulphate reducers e g desulfobacter has been associated with the occurrence of internal sulphur cycle in the system st james and richardson 2020 although desulfobacter was not identified by metaproteomics it was recovered as a good lipolytic mag and had high abundance at all reactor conditions fig 3 sulphate reduction limits pha accumulation and sulphate reducers in the absence of sulphate can switch to syntrophic and fermentative metabolisms st james and richardson 2020 overall the combination of metagenomics and metaproteomics failed to identify true lipolytic psychrophiles in the anmbrs with the described operational conditions although biomarkers like fadl gene were found by metaproteomics the absence of lipases in the analysed metaproteome prevented any clear conclusion none of the recovered putative lipolytic mags were among the taxa found by metaproteomics therefore we could not determine which cold adapted microorganism is a true lipid degrader and which might use the lipase for miscellaneous purposes like the pha accumulation degradation denitrification or invasion future studies can therefore investigate how lipolysis and pha accumulation degradation are linked and why and when microbes might use lipases rather than pha polymerases for more conclusive results we suggest that some barriers need to be removed by different research disciplines we can reduce the effect of false positive results in the assembly and annotation steps of metagenomics by integrating both short and long sequenced reads in metaproteomics on the other hand we need to develop universal unbiased extraction methods particularly for extracellular enzymes which are more sensitive characterising the extracellular vesicle proteins and differentiating them from the eps proteins is another important issue some extracellular proteins like lipases can be present in both location but cells regulate them for different purposes this can be checked by using synthetic biology techniques that enable determination of the gene regulation mechanisms and the extracellular excretion pathways employing high resolution mass spectrometers along with developing better tools for identifying the mass spectra and matching them to protein groups can also enhance metaproteomics data analysis besides the dependency of metaproteomics to metagenomics database can be reduced through de novo approaches and finally developing chemical probes that can react with lipases which enable us to use activity based protein profiling and quantitative metaproteomics approaches for detecting extracellular lipases 4 conclusion results obtained by metagenomics and metaproteomics did not confirm each other and extracellular lipases and lipolytic bacteria were not easily identifiable by these tools in anmbr reactors operated for more than three years at 4 and 15 c treating domestic wastewater using pschycrophilic microbial community soils and sediment from arctic as inoculum 40 putative lipolytic mags were recovered from the metagenomics data of all reactors extremely lower number of lipases compared to other hydrolytic extracellular enzymes were found within the metagenomes lipolysis may not always occur exogenously lipolysis molecules may be linked to pha accumulation degradation denitrification and invasion most lipases were from phyla actinobacteria and genera mycolicibacterium and corynebacterium that accumulate phas of the 32 common abundant genera in all reactors relative abundance 1 only three chlorobium desulfobacter and mycolicibacterium were recovered as putative lipolytic mags with few exceptions there was no significant correlation between the reactor conditions and the number of reads mapped to the putative lipolytic mags out of the 32 common genera profiled by metagenomics 15 were identified by metaproteomics too at least 6 of them were involved in lipid pha accumulation metaproteomics identified fadl genes for four genera dechloromonas azoarcus aeromonas and sulfurimonas but did not identify any lipases for them also none of these four genera were recovered as putative lipolytic mags by metagenomics the proteins identified by metaproteomics were mainly porins and outer membrane proteins and some cytoplasmic proteins were identified too that might enter the eps through extracellular vesicles declaration of competing interest the authors
