upper assembly from the fpso motions the upper assembly only bears the tension and dynamic motions from the air can because of the flexibility of the tether chain if the local coordinate system is

the upper assembly are shown in table 5 4 2 results analysis fig 17 shows mises stress distribution of static numerical calculation for upper and lower assemblies it can be seen that there are several points with local stress maximum value on the joint of frame and riser joint of frame and jumper and so on the stress in these points that are defined as dangerous points is larger than peripheral region seven points on each of the upper and lower assemblies for a free standing hybrid riser are selected to measure the stress the static and dynamic test results and numerical simulation results are as follows as shown in fig 18 the test positions of the upper assembly include seven points that were selected according to dangerous points from the numerical simulation results for the stress measurement the strain rosettes that can determine the principal stresses when the stress direction cannot be determined are adopted avoiding the deviation due to the inaccuracy direction of strain gauge caused by manual operation so the results are the principal stresses instead of stress in some direction as shown in fig 26 the test positions of the lower assembly include seven points that were selected according to dangerous points from the numerical simulation results from table 7 and table 8 the deviation between numerical simulation results and experimental results is less than 6 83 and the simulation results are slightly larger than the experiment results these results are due to the experimental measurement results being the average strain covered by a strain gauge and the numerical simulation results being the data from key points validation of the static strength through numerical simulation is more conservative than experimental results for the upper and lower connecter assemblies of the free standing hybrid riser as shown from figs 19 33 comparing the model test to the numerical simulation of the upper and lower connecter assemblies shows that the law of dynamic response for each measuring point is consistent and the test results coincide with the results of numerical simulation the numerical simulation model provides a calculation method and basis for the validation and optimization of dynamic strength and fatigue strength of a free standing hybrid riser among seven points at the upper connector assembly the principal stress at measuring point 1 5 and 6 is larger then the stress could be reduced by increasing the diameter and thickness of the tube or reducing the curvature radius of the gooseneck the principal stress at measuring point 3 and 4 is smaller the further optimization could be realized by reducing the diameter and thickness of the tube to mitigate weight in dynamic test the principal stress at measuring point 1 varies greatly with time which means point 1 should be considered in the design and check of fatigue strength preferentially among seven points at the lower connector assembly the principal stress at measuring point 2 is larger then the stress could be reduced by increasing the diameter and thickness of the tube or reducing the curvature radius of the gooseneck the principal stress at measuring point 4 is smaller the further optimization could be realized by reducing the diameter and thickness of the tube to mitigate weight in dynamic test the principal stress at measuring point 1 2 and 7 varies greatly with time which means point 1 should be considered in the design and check of fatigue strength preferentially 5 conclusion 1 according to structural characteristics and the actual stress state of the upper and lower connecter assemblies of the free standing hybrid riser the corresponding numerical simulation model is established independently and the static and dynamic response

developed 3 static and dynamic tests were carried out by the test device for the upper and lower assemblies of a free standing hybrid riser compared with the numerical simulation results the deviation of the static results between numerical simulation and experiments is small the law of dynamic response for each measuring point is consistent and the test results coincide with the numerical simulation results which provides a calculation method and basis for validation and optimization of static strength and fatigue strength for a connecter assembly of a free standing hybrid riser 4 for upper connector assembly the further optimization could be realized by increasing the diameter and thickness of the tube at the joint of main frame and the riser reducing the curvature radius of the gooseneck and reducing the diameter and thickness of main frame for lower connector assembly the further optimization could be realized by increasing the diameter and thickness of the tube at the joint of main frame and the riser and reducing the diameter and thickness at the joint of main frame and the rigid jumper the establishment of the calculation model and the development of the test

ratio determination for model test the scale of model test generally are allowed from 1 1 to 1 70 considering the difference of structure stress and manufacture between test model and actual structure

moisture 4 experimental comparison 4 1 conditions and parameters the static and dynamic numerical calculations and corresponding test for the upper and lower assemblies of a free standing hybrid riser were carried out the boundary parameters of the upper and lower assemblies are shown in fig 16 and the quantitative values of these conditions are shown in table 5 and table 6 the test conditions of the upper assembly are shown in table 5 4 2 results analysis fig 17 shows mises stress distribution of static numerical calculation for upper and lower assemblies it can be seen that there are several points with local stress maximum value on the joint of frame and riser joint of frame and jumper and so on the stress in these points that are defined as dangerous points is larger than peripheral region seven points on each of the upper and lower assemblies for a free standing hybrid riser are selected to measure the stress the static and dynamic test results and numerical simulation results are as follows as shown in fig 18 the test positions of the upper assembly include seven points that were selected according to dangerous points from the numerical simulation results for the stress measurement the strain rosettes that can determine the principal stresses when the stress direction cannot be determined are adopted avoiding the deviation due to the inaccuracy direction of strain gauge caused by manual operation so the results are the principal stresses instead of stress in some direction as shown in fig 26 the test positions of the lower assembly include seven points that were selected according to dangerous points from the numerical simulation results from table 7 and table 8 the deviation between numerical simulation results and experimental results is less than 6 83 and the simulation results are slightly larger than the experiment results these results are due to the experimental measurement results being the average strain covered by a strain gauge and the numerical simulation results being the data from key points validation of the static strength through numerical simulation is more conservative than experimental results for the upper and lower connecter assemblies of the free standing hybrid riser as shown from figs 19 33 comparing the model test to the numerical simulation of the upper and lower connecter assemblies shows that the law of dynamic response for each measuring point is consistent and the test results coincide with the results of numerical simulation the numerical simulation model provides a calculation method and basis for the validation and optimization of dynamic strength and fatigue strength of a free standing hybrid riser among seven points at the upper connector assembly the principal stress at measuring point 1 5 and 6 is larger then the stress could be reduced by increasing the diameter and thickness of the tube or reducing the curvature radius of the gooseneck the principal stress at measuring point 3 and 4 is smaller the further optimization could be realized by reducing the diameter and thickness of the tube to mitigate weight in dynamic test the principal stress at measuring point 1 varies greatly with time which means point 1 should be considered in the design and check of fatigue strength preferentially among seven points at the lower connector assembly the principal stress at measuring point 2 is larger then the stress could be reduced by increasing the diameter and thickness of the tube or reducing the curvature radius of the gooseneck the principal stress at measuring point 4 is smaller the further optimization could be realized by reducing the diameter and thickness of the tube to mitigate weight in dynamic test the principal stress at measuring point 1 2 and 7 varies greatly with time which means point 1 should be considered in the design and check of fatigue strength preferentially 5 conclusion 1 according to structural characteristics and the actual stress state of the upper and lower connecter assemblies of the free standing hybrid riser the corresponding numerical simulation model is established independently and the static and dynamic response is obtained to further verify the accuracy and reliability of the calculation model for actual working conditions 2 based on the similarity theory a prototype test model is built and a physical model

developed 3 static and dynamic tests were carried out by the test device for the upper and lower assemblies of a free standing hybrid riser compared with the numerical simulation results the deviation of the static results between numerical simulation and experiments is small the law of dynamic response for each measuring point is consistent and the test results coincide with the numerical simulation results which provides a calculation method and basis for validation and optimization of static strength and fatigue strength for a connecter assembly of a free standing hybrid riser 4 for upper connector assembly the further optimization could be realized by increasing the diameter and thickness of the tube at the joint of main frame and the riser reducing the curvature radius of the

23491,pile rocking is the motion of a mono pile foundation as a result of cyclic loads caused by wind and wave and the effect of upper structures such as offshore wind turbines the rocking effect further complicates the interaction between a mono pile and the seabed and results in instability of offshore structures in this research a three dimensional integrated numerical model combining the effect of wave loads with the seabed and mono pile is adopted to investigate wave structure seabed interaction wssi considering the pile rocking effect the present model is validated by available laboratory experiment data and analytical results in addition a detailed comparison with a non rocking single pile is conducted to examine the effect of pile rocking on soil response more clearly finally the momentary liquefaction depth is investigated and a parametric study on pore pressure response has been carried out results indicate that local pressure enlargement occurs near the mudline and the rate of pore pressure decrease in depth is slowed down due to pile rocking leading to a relatively high pore pressure in the upper soil range furthermore the pile rocking effect has a significant influence on the liquefaction distribution and enlarges the liquefaction zone in the vicinity of mono pile foundation keywords wssi mono pile foundation pile rocking dynamic seabed response liquefaction 1 introduction nowadays with the growing interest in offshore exploitation for renewable resources such as wind energy interaction between marine structures and the seabed subjected to wave loadings has been the focus of much attention within the field of coastal engineering mono piles are one of the most used forms of foundations for offshore wind turbines this can be attributed to its relatively low construction cost compared to other available alternatives and will probably remain the preferred foundation type in the future chen 2011 doherty and gavin 2012 negro et al 2017 as a result the response of a mono pile subjected to wave loads and the interaction with the seabed have been extensively studied in the past lu and jeng 2008 li et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 however one of the great challenges faced by geotechnical specialists now is that mono pile foundations in ocean environments have different design requirements based on various wave and soil characteristics additionally some field observations have shown that a number of mono piles behave more rigid than expected but structure failure may still take place due to seabed instability chen and zhang 2013 chen et al 2017 furthermore a mono pile serving as foundation for a wind turbine is subjected to cyclic lateral loadings caused by wind and waves rotor mass imbalance and blade passage arany et al 2015 bhattacharya et al 2013 have illustrated the dynamic cyclic loading on mono pile foundations of wind turbines induced by wind and wave loads as a result the cyclic loading on a mono pile may induce the pile rocking effect which is still not fully understood and may cause trouble to the design of wind turbine foundations therefore it is necessary to improve the understanding of the interaction between the seabed and a mono pile subjected to dynamic wave loadings with the consideration of pile rocking research on the seabed response subjected to dynamic wave loading is one of the key points of the wssi problem in previous research various analytical solutions have been developed to study the wave induced seabed response madsen 1978 yamamoto et al 1978 zienkiewicz and shiomi 1984 ulker et al 2009 it is of vital importance that when considering the fluid solid coupled theory as proposed by biot 1941 1962 which is based on the assumption of a poro elastic seabed the skeleton motion of soil particles with pore fluid is treated as elastic deformation in the following research three models were developed quasi static qs model that neglects accelerations of fluid and soil particle partly dynamic u p model that encloses acceleration of soil particles and the fully dynamic u w model that considers accelerations of both fluid and soil particles the biot s qs model adopted in this study has been most widely used in research of wave induced seabed response because of its calculation efficiency and wide range of applications it ignores the second order term of acceleration of the soil skeleton and porous fluid which is considered in u p and u w models moreover a number of laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the seabed response under various wave loadings using different methods sumer et al 2012 liu et al 2015 liu and jeng 2016 research on pile rocking induced by cyclic lateral loads has been conducted in recent years the method of p y curve is a traditional way to analyze a laterally loaded pile by assuming that the pile is supported by a number of discrete springs however it has shortcomings that the data used is quite different from the real situation in some cases byrne et al 2010 hokmabadi et al 2012 conducted a full scale test on a lateral loaded pile and provided a computer code to do calibration for a traditional p y curve in addition with the development of finite element models researchers have set up various numerical models in order to have a more accurate understanding of interaction between seabed soil and a pile foundation brown and shie 1990 wang et al 2001 yang and jeremić 2002 eicher et al 2003 however effects of pore water pressure and porous seabed were not fully taken into consideration in these studies in recent years some research about dynamic seabed response in the vicinity of a pile foundation has been published jeng et al 2011 chang and jeng 2014 sui et al 2016 ye et al 2016 lin et al 2017 some researchers have paid attention to the seismic response of structures caused by different types of pile foundations considering soil pile structures interaction hokmabadi and fatahi 2015 van nguyen et al 2017 awad allah et al 2017 have conducted laboratory tests to study the response of various pile foundation forms of wind turbines solely subjected to cyclic lateral loadings jeng et al 2011 gave a 2d numerical model example for rocking of a mono pile in a porous seabed simulated in comsol and focused on pore pressure variation of different parameters in addition some other researchers have focused on the interaction between seabed and mono pile by imposing a cyclic load on top of a pile cuéllar 2011 cuéllar et al 2012 hansen 2012 cuéllar 2011 gave a review in relation to the short term response arising from cyclic loadings the model considered in this research adopts biot s consolidation equations to handle pore water pressure generation during cyclic loading while cuéllar focused on seabed liquefaction rather than on interaction between seabed and the mono pile moreover effects of dynamic wave pressure are not completely taken into consideration in these researches for seabed and mono pile interaction thus there is a need for seabed pile interaction research that combines the effects of dynamic wave pressure with pile rocking caused by cyclic loads in this study a 3d integrated numerical model is established to investigate interaction between seabed and a mono pile subjected to pile rocking and wave loading based on the user defined pde partial differential equation method which is a novel and flexible way to study the rocking induced response the wave sub model with mono pile is governed by varans equations in the framework of flow 3d the seabed sub model is treated as an isotropic medium governed by biot s qs model and the mono pile is solved based on the elastic theory implemented in comsol multiphysics in addition the pile rocking motion is simulated by cyclic displacements applied on the head of mono pile detailed description of the wave and seabed sub model is illustrated in section 2 and 3 the present model is validated by available laboratory experiment data and previous analytical results in section 4 then the present model is applied to simulate the dynamic response of the seabed and mono pile and the effect of pile rocking is comparatively studied in section 5 finally the seabed liquefaction potential is discussed for a better understanding of the interaction between seabed and mono pile 2 description of numerical model fig 1 presents the integrated model combining wave and seabed sub models the wave sub model denotes the part above the mudline including the wave tank and mono pile the seabed sub model denotes the part below the mudline containing the porous seabed and embedded part of the mono pile as can be seen in fig 1 the integrated model adopts a cartesian coordinate system origin o is set at the position of wave inlet on the mudline surface the x y and z axes denote the direction of wave propagation the direction perpendicular to wave propagation in horizontal plane and vertical direction respectively in addition l denotes one wavelength in the wave tank x p denotes cyclic horizontal displacement of the pile head d is the diameter of the mono pile l is the embedded depth of the mono pile d denotes the mean water depth h denotes the depth of porous seabed the size of the water tank ranges from point o to point b which equals the length of calculation domain w moreover boundary conditions given in fig 1 will be discussed in detail in section 3 2 1 wave sub model in the wave sub model as shown in fig 2 a a mono pile foundation in a numerical wave tank with dimensions of 196 m long 30 m wide and 15 m high is established where the length of wave tank is 100 m and the length of wave absorbing layer is 96 m the mono pile is positioned 50 m away from the wave inlet boundary a fine mesh block is set to ensure the accuracy of the numerical model which totally contains 705 600 cells and is shown in fig 2 a 2 2 seabed sub model with mono pile a fem finite element method model is set up in the seabed sub model by implement of comsol multiphysics5 2 software package to obtain dynamic responses of both seabed and mono pile the pde partial differential equation module of the software is adopted to design user s individual governing equations and boundary conditions for simulation in which biot s qs model is adopted for seabed soil and the modified qs model without pore pressure is used for the mono pile as shown in fig 2 b the area modeled of the seabed sub model measures 100 m 30 m 27 m and the mono pile is embedded into the seabed according to the study of seabed response and lateral sides by ye and jeng 2012 the length of seabed model is 100 m which is about 2 1 times the wave length so it is accurate enough to analyze the seabed response in the vicinity of mono pile the whole seabed sub model including seabed soil and mono pile is discretized into unstructured lagrange elements with a maximum global element size of 3 m at the edge of the model and a minimum size of 0 7 m at the position near the mono pile which totally contains 63 000 elements meanwhile refinement of mesh is conducted in the regions on and around the mono pile and it will certainly help to obtain numerical results with acceptable accuracy in the vicinity of the mono pile 2 3 integration of wave and seabed sub models in this study an integrated model of wave and seabed is constructed the wave sub model is in charge of simulation of the wave motion and obtaining dynamic wave pressure acting on porous seabed and the mono pile at different moments the seabed sub model with mono pile is set up for simulating wave induced seabed response considering pile rocking therefore data transmission is needed to combine two sub models together with real time dynamic wave pressure which is achieved at the interface of wave and seabed the seabed sub model then simulates the dynamic response of the seabed soil and mono pile through data transmission to obtain the pore water pressure of seabed and displacements stresses and bending moments of the mono pile the detailed process is illustrated in fig 3 3 theoretical methods and simulation conditions in this section the governing equations and boundary conditions of both the wave and seabed sub model adopted in simulations are discussed in detail 3 1 wave sub model 3 1 1 governing equations based on mass and momentum conservation equations the varans equations are adopted to describe motion of incompressible viscous fluid the governing equations can be expressed as 1 u f i x i 0 2 ρ f u f i t ρ f u f i u f j x j p f x i x j μ u f i x j u f j x i x j ρ f u f i u f j ρ f g i where x i is the cartesian coordinate ρ f is the density of fluid u fi is the ensemble mean velocity p f is the pressure of fluid μ is the dynamic viscosity t is the time and g i is the gravitation acceleration the reynolds stress term ρ f u fi u fj is modeled by the sophisticated 2 equations κ ε turbulance model launder and spalding 1974 and then reynolds stress term can be estimated by 3 ρ f u f i u f j μ t u f i x j u f j x i 2 3 ρ f δ i j κ where μ t is the turbulent viscosity κ is the turbulence kinetic energy and δ ij is the kronecker delta based on eq 3 eq 2 can be rewritten as 4 ρ f u f i t ρ f u f i u f j x j x i ρ f 2 3 ρ f κ x j μ e f f u f i x j u f j x i ρ f g i in which μ eff μ μ t is the total effective viscosity 3 1 2 boundary conditions appropriate boundary conditions are required to solve the varans equations of wave sub model as shown in both figs 1 and 2 a linear wave is generated at the wave inlet boundary at positon of x 0 moreover the outflow boundary is applied at the wave outlet area and a sponge layer is adopted to absorb waves in order to minimize the reflection of wave mainly caused by the outflow boundary which may induce the rising or falling of free water surface during wave propagation simulations since the sponge layer needs to work with the outflow boundary to make most use of it it is only adopted at the front of the outflow boundary in the wave model inside the sponge layer the navier stokes equation is modified as 5 u t u u 1 ρ p v u k u u s t r where k u u s t r is the artificial damping force to dissipate the wave motion k is the damping coefficient in units of time 1 and u s t r is the background stream velocity that is exempted from damping the atmosphere pressure on the free water surface is considered to be 101 kpa the wall boundary is adopted at the bottom of wave tank to make sure the velocity of fluid in the normal direction is zero in addition symmetry bounday conditions are adopted at the two lateral sides of wave sub model which means the wave can slide freely along the boundary without penetration moreover the time interval adopted in wave simulation is automatically adjusted at each time step to satisfy the diffusive limit calculation condition 3 2 seabed sub model 3 2 1 governing equations according to previous research about seabed response under wave pressure biot s qs model is suitable and accurate enough to simulate most seabed soil of low permeability under low frequency waves jeng and cha 2003 considering the wave and seabed parameters used in this research biot s qs model is adopted as the governing equations for the investigation of wave induced pore pressure in a porous seabed to increase the simulation efficiency in this study the porous seabed is considered to be isotropic homogeneous with the same permeability k in all directions and the fluid follows darcy s law the conservation of mass is expressed as 6 k 2 p γ w n β p t γ w ε s t where 2 2 x 2 2 y 2 2 z 2 is the laplace operator p is the wave induced pore pressure in seabed γ w is the unit weigth of pore water n is the soil porosity k is the soil permeability the volume strain of soil matrix ε s and the compressibility of pore fluid β are defined respectively as follow 7 ε s u s x v s y w s z 8 β 1 k 1 k w 1 s r p w 0 where u s v s and w s are the seabed soil displacements in x y and z direction respectively k w is the true modulus of elasticity of pore water taken as 2 109 pa p w0 is the absolute water pressure and s r is the seabed degree of saturation neglecting the effects of body forces and inertia terms the equilibrium equations can be written as 9 σ x x τ xy y τ x z z p x 10 τ x y x σ y y τ y z z p y 11 τ x z x τ y z y σ z z p z in which σ x σy and σ z are the effective normal stresses of soil in x y z direction respecively τ xy τ yz and τ xz are shear stresses of the seabed soil the poro elastic constitutive model is used to describe the behaviour of seabed soil then effective normal stresses and shear stresses can be expressed in terms of seabed displacement as 12 σ x 2 g s u s x μ s 1 μ s ε s 13 σ y 2 g s v s y μ s 1 μ s ε s 14 σ z 2 g s w s z μ s 1 μ s ε s 15 τ x z g s u s z w s x τ z x 16 τ y z g s v s z w s y τ z y 17 τ x y g s u s y v s x τ y x where the shear modulus g s is related to young s module e s and the poisson s ratio μ s in the form of es 2 1 μ s substituting eqs 12 17 into 9 11 the equations of force equilibrium then become 18 20 in x y and z direction respectively 18 g s 2 u s g s 1 2 μ s ε s x p x 19 g s 2 v s g s 1 2 μ s ε s y p y 20 g s 2 w s g s 1 2 μ s ε s z p z 3 2 2 boundary conditions appropriate boundary conditions are required to solve the governing eqs 6 and 18 20 of the porous seabed at the seabed surface the wave induced pore water pressure p is set to be equal to dynamic wave pressure p w at the mudline which is obtained from the wave sub model the vertical effective normal stresses and shear stresses are considered to be 0 21 σ z τ z x τ z y 0 p p w at z 0 at the bottom of the seabed an impermeable rigid boundary condition is applied where the seabed displacement is zero and no vertical flow occurs 22 u s v s w s p z 0 at z h the four lateral sides of the seabed model are considered to be impermeable as well which means that zero seabed displacement and no flow occur in x direction at the left and right sides and the same situation in y direction at the front and back sides 23 u p x 0 at x 0 and x w 24 v p y 0 at y 0 and y b where w and b are the length and width of the seabed sub model 3 3 mono pile simulation 3 3 1 governing equations in order to simulate the displacement of mono pile and interaction with seabed subjected to dynamic waves more realistically the numerical model of mono pile adopted in this study is quite different from other previously conducted research since pore water pressure inside the mono pile is not a considerable factor a modified biot s qs model based on the elastic theory while neglecting the effect of pore water pressure is adopted to describe the motion of mono pile which can be defined as 25 g p 2 u p g p 1 2 μ p ε p x 0 26 g p 2 v p g p 1 2 μ p ε p y 0 27 g p 2 w p g p 1 2 μ p ε p z 0 where u p v p and w p are the displacements of mono pile in x y and z direction respectively ε p u p x v p y w p z is the volume strain of mono pile g p is the shear modulus and μ p is the poisson s ratio of pile material 3 3 2 boundary conditions the pile rocking effect is simulated by applying a horizontal cyclic displacement on the pile head subjected to the dirichlet boundary condition at the top surface of the mono pile the pile displacement used in the numerical model is expressed as follow 28 x p x p sin ω t where x p is the amplitude of cyclic horizontal displacement of the pile head t denotes the time and ω is the angular frequency of cyclic motion the interface between mono pile and porous seabed is considered as no slip and impermeable to study the coupled interaction effect better it implies that the displacement of seabed soil at the mono pile interface is identical to the displacement of the mono pile which can be expressed as 29 u s u p v s v p and w s w p 30 p n 0 4 model validation in this section three parts including the wave sub model seabed response of wave seabed integrated model and soil response subjected to pile rocking are validated by available laboratory experiment data and analytical solutions to ensure the accuracy of the numerical simulations 4 1 wave sub model firstly results of the wave sub model are compared with the experimental data presented in research of chen et al 2014 and zang et al 2010 in order to ensure the simulation accuracy of turbulent waves interacting with the mono pile in this experiment regular waves are used to study the nonlinear wave structure interaction in a 35 m 25 m water basin the wave field is created by a segmented piston paddle array installed at one end of the water basin and the cylinder was located at 7 52 m from the paddles in the centre of the tank the wave and pile characteristics used for wave sub model validation are listed in table 1 fig 4 shows the layout of the laboratory experiment as described by chen et al 2014 in which a linear wave train with a wave height of h 0 14 m and wave period of t 1 22 s is adopted to study turbulent wave and mono pile interaction moreover a diameter of mono pile d 0 25 m and mean water depth d 0 505 m are adopted in this experiment there are several wave gauges placed at various positions in the wave tank wave gauge 1 g1 and gauge 2 g2 as presented in fig 4 are used to measure the free surface elevation g1 is located 0 77 m from the inlet and g2 is located 0 002 m away from the front pile surface along the centreline the wave sub model with same parameters adopted in laboratory experiment is established for validation the resolution of refined wave mesh is 14 points per wave height fig 5 a shows the comparison of simulated and experimental free surface elevation at wave gauge 1 simulated results of the wave sub model show good agreement with the experimental results fig 5 b illustrates time series of simulated and experimental free surface elevation measured close to the mono pile at wave gauge 2 overall consistency is shown in fig 5 b but a small sudden change at the upward part can be noticed this distortion can be attributed to the use of the κ ε turbulence wave model as a result the turbulence is magnified at the position close to the mono pile compared to the place near the wave inlet in general the present wave sub model has the ability to simulate wave pile interaction accurately 4 2 seabed response of wave seabed integrated model in this section the seabed response is validated by the analytical solution of hsu and jeng 1994 and the adopted calculation parameters are presented in table 2 the validation combines the wave and seabed model and the seabed response is obtained through the integrated model considering wave pressure acting on the top of seabed result comparisons are done between the present model and previous study results from hsu and jeng 1994 as shown in fig 6 in which the solid lines denote results of the present model and the dot lines represent the analytical solution p 0 denotes the amplitude of wave dynamic pressure of linear waves on the upper soil surface biot s equations in qs form are adopted in hsu and jeng 1994 which is in line with the present model and excellent consistency is shown in fig 6 4 3 soil response under pile rocking effect since there is a lack of relevant research about the pile rocking effect it is necessary and of great importance to validate the numerical accuracy of the present rocking pile model as a result the rocking pile model is validated by the laboratory experiment results of hansen 2012 as shown in fig 7 the experiment is set up to investigate the soil response under pile rocking caused by cyclic loading without consideration of dynamic wave pressure the main result measured in this experiment is pore water pressure near the pile surface which is recorded by pressure tappings set at three different distances away from the mono pile surface 2 7 and 12 cm along the vertical direction two major tests of coarse sand and coarse silt are included in the experiment which is validated by the coarse sand case the soil and pile cyclic motion parameters adopted for validation are listed in table 3 comparison of the vertical distribution of pore pressure at t 2 65 s in both experiment and simulation is illustrated in fig 8 in which the solid line represents the results of the present rocking pile model and the dash line denotes the experiment results the pore pressure comparison shows good consistency in general considering the difference of research methods and simulation conditions between numerical model and experiment the present numerical model is considered to be acceptable and accurate to simulate the pile rocking effect in conclusion the present wave seabed integrated model has the capacity to simulate dynamic wave seabed pile interaction subjected to the pile rocking effect 5 numerical analysis and discussion in this section the present model is applied to investigate interaction of seabed and mono pile subjected to both dynamic wave loadings and pile rocking simulated by an applied horizontal cyclic displacement the adoption of calculation parameters is important for research on the rocking induced seabed and pile response negro et al 2017 has studied the preliminary estimation of main dimensions for monopoles in offshore wind farms in europe the practical diameter range of mono pile foundations in wind farms is about 2 7 m the range of pile length is about 20 70 m and the range of water depth is around 0 30 m dnv 2011 has given the typical range of forcing frequencies for 5 mw wind turbines including the cyclic load caused by wind and wave loadings and wind turbine rotation and blade passing which is in the range of 0 05 0 75 hz approximately in this research the typical input data as presented in table 4 is adopted for simulation of the rocking induced seabed and mono pile response which is in line with the actual engineering conditions furthermore in order to distinguish the pile rocking effect on the interaction between seabed soil and mono pile more clearly a single pile model without rocking displacement non rocking pile model is presented in this section for comparative analysis in which the other conditions are all the same as in the rocking pile model the range of time series adopted in simulation is 0 7t fig 9 illustrates several typical locations of the pile cyclic displacement imposed on the head of mono pile during one period from t 34 5 s 5 75t to 40 5 s 6 75t in which pos 1 and pos 7 denote the positive and negative peak displacement respectively pos 3 and pos 5 denote half of the peak displacement and pos 4 denotes the balance position of pile rocking the value of rocking displacement and time series of pile motion are marked in fig 9 a as well in addition front side and back side denote the relative position of mono pile according to wave propagation based on the balance point moreover the phase change of cyclic displacement is shown in fig 9 b and the corresponding wave pressure during one period is given in fig 9 c in which 5 75t and 6 25t are the time when wave trough and crest arrives at the pile head 5 1 wave induced seabed response around mono pile the distribution of pore water pressure around offshore structures is a major concern with respect to seabed liquefaction in this section vertical distribution of pore water pressure in the vicinity of mono pile is obtained at the position located 0 1 m away from the upstream mono pile surface along the centerline which is positioned at the front side shown in fig 9 fig 10 shows the vertical distribution of pore water pressure at front side of two models during one period from t 5 75t to t 6 67t in which fig 10 a and b show results of the rocking pile model while fig 10 c and d show results of the non rocking pile model it is clearly shown that pore pressure decreases with the embedded depth the reduction is rather small near the lower part of pile for both models while the slope of decrease of the non rocking pile model is steeper than that of the rocking pile model for example at time t t 6 17 the maximum pressure value for both models is 7 7 kpa at the mudline the decrease of pore pressure to 1 kpa occurs at z 4 5 m for the rocking pile model as shown in fig 10 a and at z 1 6 m for the non rocking pile model as shown in fig 10 c in addition local pressure enlargement is observed at some moments for the rocking pile model this indicates that the pore pressure around the mono pile will increase at the upper seabed from about z 0 5 m to top of seabed when the mono pile is near the peak displacement locations this is marked in fig 10 a and b while this was not found in the non rocking pile model moreover the vertical distribution of pore pressure at time of 5 92t 6t 6 42t and 6 5t is similar in both models because the displacement of the pile is relatively small and its effects on local pressure variation is not significant fig 11 shows the detailed comparison of vertical distribution between two models at different times fig 11 a e show pressure results when the mono pile is at the position of x p 10 5 0 5 and 10 mm respectively when t t 5 75 in fig 11 a the maximum pressure value is 6 6 kpa at top of the seabed for the non rocking pile model while there is a local enlargement to 6 9 kpa at z 0 5 m for the rocking pile model and the pressure decrease along depth is slower than for the non rocking pile model when the pile moves to the half displacement position in fig 11 b and d the pressure variation is similar in both models generally but the slope of decrease is steeper for the non rocking pile model in fig 11 e when t t 6 25 the maximum pressure value is 6 4 kpa at top of the seabed for the non rocking model while there is a local enlargement up to 6 6 kpa at z 0 5 m for the rocking pile model for the mono pile at pos 4 shown in fig 11 c pore pressure distribution of the two models is similar and shows good symmetry between 6t and 6 5t when the mono pile reaches its balanced position contour plots of pore water pressure in the seabed with pile and seabed motion at three different moments of two models are shown in fig 12 considering the mono pile at pos 1 firstly when t t 5 75 as shown in fig 12 a the pore pressure in the seabed is all negative at the seabed top around the pile of non rocking pile model and pore pressure value is almost the same for both front and back sides of the pile while in the rocking pile model larger negative pore pressure is found at the front side of pile because of the suction effect of pore water caused by soil and pile movement in the positive direction of x axis in contrast pore pressure at the back side becomes a positive value for the compression effect due to pile and soil forward displacement moreover considering the pile at pos 7 when t t 6 25 as illustrated in fig 12 b pore pressure of the seabed is a positive value at the seabed top around the pile in the non rocking pile model while a larger positive pore pressure is found at the front side of pile in the rocking pile model because of the compression effect caused by backward movement in addition a negative value is found at the back side due to the suction effect of pile motion for t t 6 67 when the mono pile is at pos 2 moved from front side to back side as shown in fig 12 c pressure variation is similar to the situation shown in fig 12 a while the value of positive pressure at the back side is larger in the rocking pile model because negative pressure at the seabed top is smaller in fig 12 a for mono piles at other positons the situation of pressure variation can be explained by the same mechanism in conclusion reason for the differences between two models is that pile rocking will visibly change the local force condition and induce local pore pressure enlargement near the peak displacement locations caused by soil suction and compression effect in addition the trend of pressure decrease clearly slows down in the rocking pile model this can be attributed to the increased contact between mono pile and seabed as a result of pile rocking which leads to higher pore pressures in the upper soil range furthermore the vertical distribution of pore pressure for both models shows good symmetry which is reasonable under the load condition set in this simulation 5 2 response of mono pile under the interaction with seabed fig 13 shows the vertical distribution of horizontal displacement of the mono pile at different times over one period of two models the amplitude of cyclic displacement imposed on the pile head is set to be 10 mm in this research which is about 6 2 times the maximum displacement of the non rocking pile model 1 6 mm furthermore the maximum displacement at mudline surface z 0 is about 1 2 mm of the rocking pile model and it is about 3 8 times of the non rocking pile model which equals to 0 32 mm while the displacement at seabed bottom is similar for both two models it is clear that the horizontal displacement varies a lot above the mudline while it has much less change within the embedded part which clearly shows the restrain effect of seabed soil compared to the non rocking model the present pile rocking model better reflects the effect of soil pile contact due to the larger horizontal displacement the vertical distribution of bending moment of mono pile in the rocking pile model is shown in fig 14 the bending moment results at time of 5 75t 5 92t 6t and 6 25t are shown in fig 14 a b c and d respectively at which the horizontal displacement of pile head is 10 5 0 and 10 mm the peak value of bending moment appears when the mono pile is at the position of maximum horizontal displacement shown in fig 14 a and d which is both about 1300 kn m for x p 10 and 10 mm when the mono pile moves to the position of x p 5 mm in fig 14 b the maximun value of bending moment reduces to 844 kn m when the mono pile is at the centric position in fig 14 c the value of bending moment becomes much smaller and there is an inflection point at about z 4 2 m the maximum positive and negative value is 137 kn m and 221 kn m in general the value of bending moment depends on the horizontal displacement of mono pile and shows good symmetry for a certain moment the maximum value generally appears at position of z 0 35 m which is just beneath the mudline surface because of the effect of seabed counter force furthermore the bending moment eventually decreases to 0 at the bottom of mono pile 5 3 wave induced seabed liquefaction around mono pile a main reason for the upper structure collapse is that the increase of excess pore pressure under wave propagation will decrease the effective stress of the seabed this will lead to seabed liquefaction around structures which is a primary concern in offshore engineering practice accurate prediction of liquefaction in zones in the vicinity of pile foundation can help engineers to optimize design plans and improve the reliability of structures according to the liquefaction potential theory proposed by jeng 1997 2012 the liquefaction criterion can be expressed as 31 1 3 γ s γ w 1 2 k 0 z u e p p w where the left hand side of eq 31 represents the average effective geostatic stress and the right hand u e denotes the excess pore pressure which equals the difference between the wave induced pore pressure within the seabed p and dynamic wave pressure p w γ s and γ w are the unit weights of soil and water k o is the coefficient of lateral earth pressure and k o 0 5 is the commonly used value eq 31 implies that liquefaction in a seabed may occur when the excess pore pressure becomes larger than the overburden soil pressure if it attains zero or a negative value at certain depths below the seabed surface the soil skeleton will reach a liquefied state in former research wave induced liquefaction is considered to occur only under the wave trough due to the oscillatory feature of excess pore pressure so the maximum seabed liquefaction depth under wave trough can be obtained to estimate the liquefaction potential for the liquefaction analysis in this section the wave and seabed parameters taken are listed in table 3 fig 15 shows time series of the liquefaction depth variation at the front side of mono pile in two models which is located 0 1 m away from the upstream mono pile surface along the centerline and the time range varies from 5t to 6 25t it is clear that the maximum liquefaction depth of rocking pile model is larger than that of the non rocking pile model in most of the time moreover it shows that the maximum liquefaction depth is about 1 69 m below seabed surface and appears at 5 67t in the rocking pile model for the non rocking pile model the maximum liquefaction depth is 1 38 m and appears at the same time with the rocking pile model which is both induced by upward suction force when the wave trough arrives near the pile head fig 16 shows the contour plot of liquefaction depth in the vicinity of mono pile at t t 5 75 when wave trough arrives at the head of mono pile the range of liquefaction in the x direction ranges from 38 m to 66 m and the maximum liquefaction depth is about 1 6 m at this moment moreover the liquefaction depth around the pile is symmetric along the x axis and the liquefaction depth at the front side along centreline is the maximum value at the seabed pile interface while the depth at the back side along the centreline is the minimum value of about 0 8 m which is due to the different pore pressure distribution at front and back side at this moment caused by the pile rocking effect 5 4 parametric studies on pore pressure response in this section the effects of mono pile parameters including the pile diameter and maximum rocking displacement on pore pressure response are discussed to further investigate the wssi problem considering pile rocking fig 17 shows the vertical distribution of pore water pressure at different time 5 75t 6 17t of three rocking displacements at the pile head x p 10 mm 20 mm and 40 mm the two different time corresponds to the moment when the wave trough and wave crest are close to the pile head respectively in fig 17 the corresponding maximum pore pressure for two different time is 14 kpa and 16 4 kpa and a larger amplitude of rocking displacement on pile head leads to a higher maximum pore pressure it can be seen that the change of pile rocking displacement has an obvious effect on pore pressure response around the mono pile at the upper part of seabed in addition the increase of rocking displacement imposed on the pile head increases the significance of local pore pressure enlargement fig 18 illustrates the vertical distribution of pore water pressure at different time 5 75t 6 17t of four pile diameters d 2 m 3 m 4 m and 6 m in fig 18 it can be obviously seen that the increase of pile diameter results in greater values of local pore pressure enlargements together with larger influence extent at the top of seabed in addition it enlarges the change range of pore water pressure along the vertical direction and leads to relatively larger values of pore pressure at the bottom of mono pile 6 conclusions in this study a 3d integrated numerical model has been established to investigate the interaction between seabed and mono pile subjected to dynamic wave pressures in addition the effect of pile rocking caused by wave and wind loadings in ocean environment and the rotation of wind turbine blades was considered the wave sub model is governed by varans equations and the seabed sub model is simulated by biot s qs model based on the user defined pde method on the basis of elasticity theory the pile rocking was simulated by applying a cyclic displacement on the mono pile head good agreement with former experimental and theoretical results proves the simulation accuracy of the present rocking pile model furthermore a non rocking pile model was comparatively analyzed in order to illustrate the effect of pile rocking more clearly based on the numerical results obtained the following conclusions can be made 1 the vertical distribution of pore pressure of a mono pile subjected to pile rocking is different from non rocking pile model in terms of local pressure enlargement near mudline this was attributed to the suction and compression effect induced by the mono pile and seabed motion moreover the trend of pressure decrease is slower due to increased sufficient contact between the pile and surrounding soil which leads to relatively high pore pressures in the upper soil range in addition the vertical distribution of pore pressure for both models shows good symmetry 2 the present model can better reflect the interaction between seabed and mono pile subjected to dynamic wave pressures due to larger horizontal displacements of the mono pile caused by pile rocking compared to the non rocking pile model the value of bending moment depends mainly on the horizontal displacement of the mono pile and maximum bending moment usually appears at the positon just below the mudline surface because of the seabed counter force 3 the influence of pile rocking enlarges the liquefaction zone compared to the non rocking model and the maximum liquefaction depth appears below the wave trough in addition the effect of pile rocking apparently influences the liquefaction distribution in the vicinity of mono pile 4 the change of mono pile parameters has a great influence on the interaction between mono pile and the seabed parametric studies of the pile rocking displacement and the pile diameter on pore pressure response are conducted in this research results indicate that larger rocking displacements and pile diameter lead to larger local increase of pore water pressure acknowledgments this research project is financially

23491,pile rocking is the motion of a mono pile foundation as a result of cyclic loads caused by wind and wave and the effect of upper structures such as offshore wind turbines the rocking effect further complicates the interaction between a mono pile and the seabed and results in instability of offshore structures in this research a three dimensional integrated numerical model combining the effect of wave loads with the seabed and mono pile is adopted to investigate wave structure seabed interaction wssi considering the pile rocking effect the present model is validated by available laboratory experiment data and analytical results in addition a detailed comparison with a non rocking single pile is conducted to examine the effect of pile rocking on soil response more clearly finally the momentary liquefaction depth is investigated and a parametric study on pore pressure response has been carried out results indicate that local pressure enlargement occurs near the mudline and the rate of pore pressure decrease in depth is slowed down due to pile rocking leading to a relatively high pore pressure in the upper soil range furthermore the pile rocking effect has a significant influence on the liquefaction distribution and enlarges the liquefaction zone in the vicinity of mono pile foundation keywords wssi mono pile foundation pile rocking dynamic seabed response liquefaction 1 introduction nowadays with the growing interest in offshore exploitation for renewable resources such as wind energy interaction between marine structures and the seabed subjected to wave loadings has been the focus of much attention within the field of coastal engineering mono piles are one of the most used forms of foundations for offshore wind turbines this can be attributed to its relatively low construction cost compared to other available alternatives and will probably remain the preferred foundation type in the future chen 2011 doherty and gavin 2012 negro et al 2017 as a result the response of a mono pile subjected to wave loads and the interaction with the seabed have been extensively studied in the past lu and jeng 2008 li et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 however one of the great challenges faced by geotechnical specialists now is that mono pile foundations in ocean environments have different design requirements based on various wave and soil characteristics additionally some field observations have shown that a number of mono piles behave more rigid than expected but structure failure may still take place due to seabed instability chen and zhang 2013 chen et al 2017 furthermore a mono pile serving as foundation for a wind turbine is subjected to cyclic lateral loadings caused by wind and waves rotor mass imbalance and blade passage arany et al 2015 bhattacharya et al 2013 have illustrated the dynamic cyclic loading on mono pile foundations of wind turbines induced by wind and wave loads as a result the cyclic loading on a mono pile may induce the pile rocking effect which is still not fully understood and may cause trouble to the design of wind turbine foundations therefore it is necessary to improve the understanding of the interaction between the seabed and a mono pile subjected to dynamic wave loadings with the consideration of pile rocking research on the seabed response subjected to dynamic wave loading is one of the key points of the wssi problem in previous research various analytical solutions have been developed to study the wave induced seabed response madsen 1978 yamamoto et al 1978 zienkiewicz and shiomi 1984 ulker et al 2009 it is of vital importance that when considering the fluid solid coupled theory as proposed by biot 1941 1962 which is based on the assumption of a poro elastic seabed the skeleton motion of soil particles with pore fluid is treated as elastic deformation in the following research three models were developed quasi static qs model that neglects accelerations of fluid and soil particle partly dynamic u p model that encloses acceleration of soil particles and the fully dynamic u w model that considers accelerations of both fluid and soil particles the biot s qs model adopted in this study has been most widely used in research of wave induced seabed response because of its calculation efficiency and wide range of applications it ignores the second order term of acceleration of the soil skeleton and porous fluid which is considered in u p and u w models moreover a number of laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the seabed response under various wave loadings using different methods sumer et al 2012 liu et al 2015 liu and jeng 2016 research on pile rocking induced by cyclic lateral loads has been conducted in recent years the method of p y curve is a traditional way to analyze a laterally loaded pile by assuming that the pile is supported by a number of discrete springs however it has shortcomings that the data used is quite different from the real situation in some cases byrne et al 2010 hokmabadi et al 2012 conducted a full scale test on a lateral loaded pile and provided a computer code to do calibration for a traditional p y curve in addition with the development of finite element models researchers have set up various numerical models in order to have a more accurate understanding of interaction between seabed soil and a pile foundation brown and shie 1990 wang et al 2001 yang and jeremić 2002 eicher et al 2003 however effects of pore water pressure and porous seabed were not fully taken into consideration in these studies in recent years some research about dynamic seabed response in the vicinity of a pile foundation has been published jeng et al 2011 chang and jeng 2014 sui et al 2016 ye et al 2016 lin et al 2017 some researchers have paid attention to the seismic response of structures caused by different types of pile foundations considering soil pile structures interaction hokmabadi and fatahi 2015 van nguyen et al 2017 awad allah et al 2017 have conducted laboratory tests to study the response of various pile foundation forms of wind turbines solely subjected to cyclic lateral loadings jeng et al 2011 gave a 2d numerical model example for rocking of a mono pile in a porous seabed simulated in comsol and focused on pore pressure variation of different parameters in addition some other researchers have focused on the interaction between seabed and mono pile by imposing a cyclic load on top of a pile cuéllar 2011 cuéllar et al 2012 hansen 2012 cuéllar 2011 gave a review in relation to the short term response arising from cyclic loadings the model considered in this research adopts biot s consolidation equations to handle pore water pressure generation during cyclic loading while cuéllar focused on seabed liquefaction rather than on interaction between seabed and the mono pile moreover effects of dynamic wave pressure are not completely taken into consideration in these researches for seabed and mono pile interaction thus there is a need for seabed pile interaction research that combines the effects of dynamic wave pressure with pile rocking caused by cyclic loads in this study a 3d integrated numerical model is established to investigate interaction between seabed and a mono pile subjected to pile rocking and wave loading based on the user defined pde partial differential equation method which is a novel and flexible way to study the rocking induced response the wave sub model with mono pile is governed by varans equations in the framework of flow 3d the seabed sub model is treated as an isotropic medium governed by biot s qs model and the mono pile is solved based on the elastic theory implemented in comsol multiphysics in addition the pile rocking motion is simulated by cyclic displacements applied on the head of mono pile detailed description of the wave and seabed sub model is illustrated in section 2 and 3 the present model is validated by available laboratory experiment data and previous analytical results in section 4 then the present model is applied to simulate the dynamic response of the seabed and mono pile and the effect of pile rocking is comparatively studied in section 5 finally the seabed liquefaction potential is discussed for a better understanding of the interaction between seabed and mono pile 2 description of numerical model fig 1 presents the integrated model combining wave and seabed sub models the wave sub model denotes the part above the mudline including the wave tank and mono pile the seabed sub model denotes the part below the mudline containing the porous seabed and embedded part of the mono pile as can be seen in fig 1 the integrated model adopts a cartesian coordinate system origin o is set at the position of wave inlet on the mudline surface the x y and z axes denote the direction of wave propagation the direction perpendicular to wave propagation in horizontal plane and vertical direction respectively in addition l denotes one wavelength in the wave tank x p denotes cyclic horizontal displacement of the pile head d is the diameter of the mono pile l is the embedded depth of the mono pile d denotes the mean water depth h denotes the depth of porous seabed the size of the water tank ranges from point o to point b which equals the length of calculation domain w moreover boundary conditions given in fig 1 will be discussed in detail in section 3 2 1 wave sub model in the wave sub model as shown in fig 2 a a mono pile foundation in a numerical wave tank with dimensions of 196 m long 30 m wide and 15 m high is established where the length of wave tank is 100 m and the length of wave absorbing layer is 96 m the mono pile is positioned 50 m away from the wave inlet boundary a fine mesh block is set to ensure the accuracy of the numerical model which totally contains 705 600 cells and is shown in fig 2 a 2 2 seabed sub model with mono pile a fem finite element method model is set up in the seabed sub model by implement of comsol multiphysics5 2 software package to obtain dynamic responses of both seabed and mono pile the pde partial differential equation module of the software is adopted to design user s individual governing equations and boundary conditions for simulation in which biot s qs model is adopted for seabed soil and the modified qs model without pore pressure is used for the mono pile as shown in fig 2 b the area modeled of the seabed sub model measures 100 m 30 m 27 m and the mono pile is embedded into the seabed according to the study of seabed response and lateral sides by ye and jeng 2012 the length of seabed model is 100 m which is about 2 1 times the wave length so it is accurate enough to analyze the seabed response in the vicinity of mono pile the whole seabed sub model including seabed soil and mono pile is discretized into unstructured lagrange elements with a maximum global element size of 3 m at the edge of the model and a minimum size of 0 7 m at the position near the mono pile which totally contains 63 000 elements meanwhile refinement of mesh is conducted in the regions on and around the mono pile and it will certainly help to obtain numerical results with acceptable accuracy in the vicinity of the mono pile 2 3 integration of wave and seabed sub models in this study an integrated model of wave and seabed is constructed the wave sub model is in charge of simulation of the wave motion and obtaining dynamic wave pressure acting on porous seabed and the mono pile at different moments the seabed sub model with mono pile is set up for simulating wave induced seabed response considering pile rocking therefore data transmission is needed to combine two sub models together with real time dynamic wave pressure which is achieved at the interface of wave and seabed the seabed sub model then simulates the dynamic response of the seabed soil and mono pile through data transmission to obtain the pore water pressure of seabed and displacements stresses and bending moments of the mono pile the detailed process is illustrated in fig 3 3 theoretical methods and simulation conditions in this section the governing equations and boundary conditions of both the wave and seabed sub model adopted in simulations are discussed in detail 3 1 wave sub model 3 1 1 governing equations based on mass and momentum conservation equations the varans equations are adopted to describe motion of incompressible viscous fluid the governing equations can be expressed as 1 u f i x i 0 2 ρ f u f i t ρ f u f i u f j x j p f x i x j μ u f i x j u f j x i x j ρ f u f i u f j ρ f g i where x i is the cartesian coordinate ρ f is the density of fluid u fi is the ensemble mean velocity p f is the pressure of fluid μ is the dynamic viscosity t is the time and g i is the gravitation acceleration the reynolds stress term ρ f u fi u fj is modeled by the sophisticated 2 equations κ ε turbulance model launder and spalding 1974 and then reynolds stress term can be estimated by 3 ρ f u f i u f j μ t u f i x j u f j x i 2 3 ρ f δ i j κ where μ t is the turbulent viscosity κ is the turbulence kinetic energy and δ ij is the kronecker delta based on eq 3 eq 2 can be rewritten as 4 ρ f u f i t ρ f u f i u f j x j x i ρ f 2 3 ρ f κ x j μ e f f u f i x j u f j x i ρ f g i in which μ eff μ μ t is the total effective viscosity 3 1 2 boundary conditions appropriate boundary conditions are required to solve the varans equations of wave sub model as shown in both figs 1 and 2 a linear wave is generated at the wave inlet boundary at positon of x 0 moreover the outflow boundary is applied at the wave outlet area and a sponge layer is adopted to absorb waves in order to minimize the reflection of wave mainly caused by the outflow boundary which may induce the rising or falling of free water surface during wave propagation simulations since the sponge layer needs to work with the outflow boundary to make most use of it it is only adopted at the front of the outflow boundary in the wave model inside the sponge layer the navier stokes equation is modified as 5 u t u u 1 ρ p v u k u u s t r where k u u s t r is the artificial damping force to dissipate the wave motion k is the damping coefficient in units of time 1 and u s t r is the background stream velocity that is exempted from damping the atmosphere pressure on the free water surface is considered to be 101 kpa the wall boundary is adopted at the bottom of wave tank to make sure the velocity of fluid in the normal direction is zero in addition symmetry bounday conditions are adopted at the two lateral sides of wave sub model which means the wave can slide freely along the boundary without penetration moreover the time interval adopted in wave simulation is automatically adjusted at each time step to satisfy the diffusive limit calculation condition 3 2 seabed sub model 3 2 1 governing equations according to previous research about seabed response under wave pressure biot s qs model is suitable and accurate enough to simulate most seabed soil of low permeability under low frequency waves jeng and cha 2003 considering the wave and seabed parameters used in this research biot s qs model is adopted as the governing equations for the investigation of wave induced pore pressure in a porous seabed to increase the simulation efficiency in this study the porous seabed is considered to be isotropic homogeneous with the same permeability k in all directions and the fluid follows darcy s law the conservation of mass is expressed as 6 k 2 p γ w n β p t γ w ε s t where 2 2 x 2 2 y 2 2 z 2 is the laplace operator p is the wave induced pore pressure in seabed γ w is the unit weigth of pore water n is the soil porosity k is the soil permeability the volume strain of soil matrix ε s and the compressibility of pore fluid β are defined respectively as follow 7 ε s u s x v s y w s z 8 β 1 k 1 k w 1 s r p w 0 where u s v s and w s are the seabed soil displacements in x y and z direction respectively k w is the true modulus of elasticity of pore water taken as 2 109 pa p w0 is the absolute water pressure and s r is the seabed degree of saturation neglecting the effects of body forces and inertia terms the equilibrium equations can be written as 9 σ x x τ xy y τ x z z p x 10 τ x y x σ y y τ y z z p y 11 τ x z x τ y z y σ z z p z in which σ x σy and σ z are the effective normal stresses of soil in x y z direction respecively τ xy τ yz and τ xz are shear stresses of the seabed soil the poro elastic constitutive model is used to describe the behaviour of seabed soil then effective normal stresses and shear stresses can be expressed in terms of seabed displacement as 12 σ x 2 g s u s x μ s 1 μ s ε s 13 σ y 2 g s v s y μ s 1 μ s ε s 14 σ z 2 g s w s z μ s 1 μ s ε s 15 τ x z g s u s z w s x τ z x 16 τ y z g s v s z w s y τ z y 17 τ x y g s u s y v s x τ y x where the shear modulus g s is related to young s module e s and the poisson s ratio μ s in the form of es 2 1 μ s substituting eqs 12 17 into 9 11 the equations of force equilibrium then become 18 20 in x y and z direction respectively 18 g s 2 u s g s 1 2 μ s ε s x p x 19 g s 2 v s g s 1 2 μ s ε s y p y 20 g s 2 w s g s 1 2 μ s ε s z p z 3 2 2 boundary conditions appropriate boundary conditions are required to solve the governing eqs 6 and 18 20 of the porous seabed at the seabed surface the wave induced pore water pressure p is set to be equal to dynamic wave pressure p w at the mudline which is obtained from the wave sub model the vertical effective normal stresses and shear stresses are considered to be 0 21 σ z τ z x τ z y 0 p p w at z 0 at the bottom of the seabed an impermeable rigid boundary condition is applied where the seabed displacement is zero and no vertical flow occurs 22 u s v s w s p z 0 at z h the four lateral sides of the seabed model are considered to be impermeable as well which means that zero seabed displacement and no flow occur in x direction at the left and right sides and the same situation in y direction at the front and back sides 23 u p x 0 at x 0 and x w 24 v p y 0 at y 0 and y b where w and b are the length and width of the seabed sub model 3 3 mono pile simulation 3 3 1 governing equations in order to simulate the displacement of mono pile and interaction with seabed subjected to dynamic waves more realistically the numerical model of mono pile adopted in this study is quite different from other previously conducted research since pore water pressure inside the mono pile is not a considerable factor a modified biot s qs model based on the elastic theory while neglecting the effect of pore water pressure is adopted to describe the motion of mono pile which can be defined as 25 g p 2 u p g p 1 2 μ p ε p x 0 26 g p 2 v p g p 1 2 μ p ε p y 0 27 g p 2 w p g p 1 2 μ p ε p z 0 where u p v p and w p are the displacements of mono pile in x y and z direction respectively ε p u p x v p y w p z is the volume strain of mono pile g p is the shear modulus and μ p is the poisson s ratio of pile material 3 3 2 boundary conditions the pile rocking effect is simulated by applying a horizontal cyclic displacement on the pile head subjected to the dirichlet boundary condition at the top surface of the mono pile the pile displacement used in the numerical model is expressed as follow 28 x p x p sin ω t where x p is the amplitude of cyclic horizontal displacement of the pile head t denotes the time and ω is the angular frequency of cyclic motion the interface between mono pile and porous seabed is considered as no slip and impermeable to study the coupled interaction effect better it implies that the displacement of seabed soil at the mono pile interface is identical to the displacement of the mono pile which can be expressed as 29 u s u p v s v p and w s w p 30 p n 0 4 model validation in this section three parts including the wave sub model seabed response of wave seabed integrated model and soil response subjected to pile rocking are validated by available laboratory experiment data and analytical solutions to ensure the accuracy of the numerical simulations 4 1 wave sub model firstly results of the wave sub model are compared with the experimental data presented in research of chen et al 2014 and zang et al 2010 in order to ensure the simulation accuracy of turbulent waves interacting with the mono pile in this experiment regular waves are used to study the nonlinear wave structure interaction in a 35 m 25 m water basin the wave field is created by a segmented piston paddle array installed at one end of the water basin and the cylinder was located at 7 52 m from the paddles in the centre of the tank the wave and pile characteristics used for wave sub model validation are listed in table 1 fig 4 shows the layout of the laboratory experiment as described by chen et al 2014 in which a linear wave train with a wave height of h 0 14 m and wave period of t 1 22 s is adopted to study turbulent wave and mono pile interaction moreover a diameter of mono pile d 0 25 m and mean water depth d 0 505 m are adopted in this experiment there are several wave gauges placed at various positions in the wave tank wave gauge 1 g1 and gauge 2 g2 as presented in fig 4 are used to measure the free surface elevation g1 is located 0 77 m from the inlet and g2 is located 0 002 m away from the front pile surface along the centreline the wave sub model with same parameters adopted in laboratory experiment is established for validation the resolution of refined wave mesh is 14 points per wave height fig 5 a shows the comparison of simulated and experimental free surface elevation at wave gauge 1 simulated results of the wave sub model show good agreement with the experimental results fig 5 b illustrates time series of simulated and experimental free surface elevation measured close to the mono pile at wave gauge 2 overall consistency is shown in fig 5 b but a small sudden change at the upward part can be noticed this distortion can be attributed to the use of the κ ε turbulence wave model as a result the turbulence is magnified at the position close to the mono pile compared to the place near the wave inlet in general the present wave sub model has the ability to simulate wave pile interaction accurately 4 2 seabed response of wave seabed integrated model in this section the seabed response is validated by the analytical solution of hsu and jeng 1994 and the adopted calculation parameters are presented in table 2 the validation combines the wave and seabed model and the seabed response is obtained through the integrated model considering wave pressure acting on the top of seabed result comparisons are done between the present model and previous study results from hsu and jeng 1994 as shown in fig 6 in which the solid lines denote results of the present model and the dot lines represent the analytical solution p 0 denotes the amplitude of wave dynamic pressure of linear waves on the upper soil surface biot s equations in qs form are adopted in hsu and jeng 1994 which is in line with the present model and excellent consistency is shown in fig 6 4 3 soil response under pile rocking effect since there is a lack of relevant research about the pile rocking effect it is necessary and of great importance to validate the numerical accuracy of the present rocking pile model as a result the rocking pile model is validated by the laboratory experiment results of hansen 2012 as shown in fig 7 the experiment is set up to investigate the soil response under pile rocking caused by cyclic loading without consideration of dynamic wave pressure the main result measured in this experiment is pore water pressure near the pile surface which is recorded by pressure tappings set at three different distances away from the mono pile surface 2 7 and 12 cm along the vertical direction two major tests of coarse sand and coarse silt are included in the experiment which is validated by the coarse sand case the soil and pile cyclic motion parameters adopted for validation are listed in table 3 comparison of the vertical distribution of pore pressure at t 2 65 s in both experiment and simulation is illustrated in fig 8 in which the solid line represents the results of the present rocking pile model and the dash line denotes the experiment results the pore pressure comparison shows good consistency in general considering the difference of research methods and simulation conditions between numerical model and experiment the present numerical model is considered to be acceptable and accurate to simulate the pile rocking effect in conclusion the present wave seabed integrated model has the capacity to simulate dynamic wave seabed pile interaction subjected to the pile rocking effect 5 numerical analysis and discussion in this section the present model is applied to investigate interaction of seabed and mono pile subjected to both dynamic wave loadings and pile rocking simulated by an applied horizontal cyclic displacement the adoption of calculation parameters is important for research on the rocking induced seabed and pile response negro et al 2017 has studied the preliminary estimation of main dimensions for monopoles in offshore wind farms in europe the practical diameter range of mono pile foundations in wind farms is about 2 7 m the range of pile length is about 20 70 m and the range of water depth is around 0 30 m dnv 2011 has given the typical range of forcing frequencies for 5 mw wind turbines including the cyclic load caused by wind and wave loadings and wind turbine rotation and blade passing which is in the range of 0 05 0 75 hz approximately in this research the typical input data as presented in table 4 is adopted for simulation of the rocking induced seabed and mono pile response which is in line with the actual engineering conditions furthermore in order to distinguish the pile rocking effect on the interaction between seabed soil and mono pile more clearly a single pile model without rocking displacement non rocking pile model is presented in this section for comparative analysis in which the other conditions are all the same as in the rocking pile model the range of time series adopted in simulation is 0 7t fig 9 illustrates several typical locations of the pile cyclic displacement imposed on the head of mono pile during one period from t 34 5 s 5 75t to 40 5 s 6 75t in which pos 1 and pos 7 denote the positive and negative peak displacement respectively pos 3 and pos 5 denote half of the peak displacement and pos 4 denotes the balance position of pile rocking the value of rocking displacement and time series of pile motion are marked in fig 9 a as well in addition front side and back side denote the relative position of mono pile according to wave propagation based on the balance point moreover the phase change of cyclic displacement is shown in fig 9 b and the corresponding wave pressure during one period is given in fig 9 c in which 5 75t and 6 25t are the time when wave trough and crest arrives at the pile head 5 1 wave induced seabed response around mono pile the distribution of pore water pressure around offshore structures is a major concern with respect to seabed liquefaction in this section vertical distribution of pore water pressure in the vicinity of mono pile is obtained at the position located 0 1 m away from the upstream mono pile surface along the centerline which is positioned at the front side shown in fig 9 fig 10 shows the vertical distribution of pore water pressure at front side of two models during one period from t 5 75t to t 6 67t in which fig 10 a and b show results of the rocking pile model while fig 10 c and d show results of the non rocking pile model it is clearly shown that pore pressure decreases with the embedded depth the reduction is rather small near the lower part of pile for both models while the slope of decrease of the non rocking pile model is steeper than that of the rocking pile model for example at time t t 6 17 the maximum pressure value for both models is 7 7 kpa at the mudline the decrease of pore pressure to 1 kpa occurs at z 4 5 m for the rocking pile model as shown in fig 10 a and at z 1 6 m for the non rocking pile model as shown in fig 10 c in addition local pressure enlargement is observed at some moments for the rocking pile model this indicates that the pore pressure around the mono pile will increase at the upper seabed from about z 0 5 m to top of seabed when the mono pile is near the peak displacement locations this is marked in fig 10 a and b while this was not found in the non rocking pile model moreover the vertical distribution of pore pressure at time of 5 92t 6t 6 42t and 6 5t is similar in both models because the displacement of the pile is relatively small and its effects on local pressure variation is not significant fig 11 shows the detailed comparison of vertical distribution between two models at different times fig 11 a e show pressure results when the mono pile is at the position of x p 10 5 0 5 and 10 mm respectively when t t 5 75 in fig 11 a the maximum pressure value is 6 6 kpa at top of the seabed for the non rocking pile model while there is a local enlargement to 6 9 kpa at z 0 5 m for the rocking pile model and the pressure decrease along depth is slower than for the non rocking pile model when the pile moves to the half displacement position in fig 11 b and d the pressure variation is similar in both models generally but the slope of decrease is steeper for the non rocking pile model in fig 11 e when t t 6 25 the maximum pressure value is 6 4 kpa at top of the seabed for the non rocking model while there is a local enlargement up to 6 6 kpa at z 0 5 m for the rocking pile model for the mono pile at pos 4 shown in fig 11 c pore pressure distribution of the two models is similar and shows good symmetry between 6t and 6 5t when the mono pile reaches its balanced position contour plots of pore water pressure in the seabed with pile and seabed motion at three different moments of two models are shown in fig 12 considering the mono pile at pos 1 firstly when t t 5 75 as shown in fig 12 a the pore pressure in the seabed is all negative at the seabed top around the pile of non rocking pile model and pore pressure value is almost the same for both front and back sides of the pile while in the rocking pile model larger negative pore pressure is found at the front side of pile because of the suction effect of pore water caused by soil and pile movement in the positive direction of x axis in contrast pore pressure at the back side becomes a positive value for the compression effect due to pile and soil forward displacement moreover considering the pile at pos 7 when t t 6 25 as illustrated in fig 12 b pore pressure of the seabed is a positive value at the seabed top around the pile in the non rocking pile model while a larger positive pore pressure is found at the front side of pile in the rocking pile model because of the compression effect caused by backward movement in addition a negative value is found at the back side due to the suction effect of pile motion for t t 6 67 when the mono pile is at pos 2 moved from front side to back side as shown in fig 12 c pressure variation is similar to the situation shown in fig 12 a while the value of positive pressure at the back side is larger in the rocking pile model because negative pressure at the seabed top is smaller in fig 12 a for mono piles at other positons the situation of pressure variation can be explained by the same mechanism in conclusion reason for the differences between two models is that pile rocking will visibly change the local force condition and induce local pore pressure enlargement near the peak displacement locations caused by soil suction and compression effect in addition the trend of pressure decrease clearly slows down in the rocking pile model this can be attributed to the increased contact between mono pile and seabed as a result of pile rocking which leads to higher pore pressures in the upper soil range furthermore the vertical distribution of pore pressure for both models shows good symmetry which is reasonable under the load condition set in this simulation 5 2 response of mono pile under the interaction with seabed fig 13 shows the vertical distribution of horizontal displacement of the mono pile at different times over one period of two models the amplitude of cyclic displacement imposed on the pile head is set to be 10 mm in this research which is about 6 2 times the maximum displacement of the non rocking pile model 1 6 mm furthermore the maximum displacement at mudline surface z 0 is about 1 2 mm of the rocking pile model and it is about 3 8 times of the non rocking pile model which equals to 0 32 mm while the displacement at seabed bottom is similar for both two models it is clear that the horizontal displacement varies a lot above the mudline while it has much less change within the embedded part which clearly shows the restrain effect of seabed soil compared to the non rocking model the present pile rocking model better reflects the effect of soil pile contact due to the larger horizontal displacement the vertical distribution of bending moment of mono pile in the rocking pile model is shown in fig 14 the bending moment results at time of 5 75t 5 92t 6t and 6 25t are shown in fig 14 a b c and d respectively at which the horizontal displacement of pile head is 10 5 0 and 10 mm the peak value of bending moment appears when the mono pile is at the position of maximum horizontal displacement shown in fig 14 a and d which is both about 1300 kn m for x p 10 and 10 mm when the mono pile moves to the position of x p 5 mm in fig 14 b the maximun value of bending moment reduces to 844 kn m when the mono pile is at the centric position in fig 14 c the value of bending moment becomes much smaller and there is an inflection point at about z 4 2 m the maximum positive and negative value is 137 kn m and 221 kn m in general the value of bending moment depends on the horizontal displacement of mono pile and shows good symmetry for a certain moment the maximum value generally appears at position of z 0 35 m which is just beneath the mudline surface because of the effect of seabed counter force furthermore the bending moment eventually decreases to 0 at the bottom of mono pile 5 3 wave induced seabed liquefaction around mono pile a main reason for the upper structure collapse is that the increase of excess pore pressure under wave propagation will decrease the effective stress of the seabed this will lead to seabed liquefaction around structures which is a primary concern in offshore engineering practice accurate prediction of liquefaction in zones in the vicinity of pile foundation can help engineers to optimize design plans and improve the reliability of structures according to the liquefaction potential theory proposed by jeng 1997 2012 the liquefaction criterion can be expressed as 31 1 3 γ s γ w 1 2 k 0 z u e p p w where the left hand side of eq 31 represents the average effective geostatic stress and the right hand u e denotes the excess pore pressure which equals the difference between the wave induced pore pressure within the seabed p and dynamic wave pressure p w γ s and γ w are the unit weights of soil and water k o is the coefficient of lateral earth pressure and k o 0 5 is the commonly used value eq 31 implies that liquefaction in a seabed may occur when the excess pore pressure becomes larger than the overburden soil pressure if it attains zero or a negative value at certain depths below the seabed surface the soil skeleton will reach a liquefied state in former research wave induced liquefaction is considered to occur only under the wave trough due to the oscillatory feature of excess pore pressure so the maximum seabed liquefaction depth under wave trough can be obtained to estimate the liquefaction potential for the liquefaction analysis in this section the wave and seabed parameters taken are listed in table 3 fig 15 shows time series of the liquefaction depth variation at the front side of mono pile in two models which is located 0 1 m away from the upstream mono pile surface along the centerline and the time range varies from 5t to 6 25t it is clear that the maximum liquefaction depth of rocking pile model is larger than that of the non rocking pile model in most of the time moreover it shows that the maximum liquefaction depth is about 1 69 m below seabed surface and appears at 5 67t in the rocking pile model for the non rocking pile model the maximum liquefaction depth is 1 38 m and appears at the same time with the rocking pile model which is both induced by upward suction force when the wave trough arrives near the pile head fig 16 shows the contour plot of liquefaction depth in the vicinity of mono pile at t t 5 75 when wave trough arrives at the head of mono pile the range of liquefaction in the x direction ranges from 38 m to 66 m and the maximum liquefaction depth is about 1 6 m at this moment moreover the liquefaction depth around the pile is symmetric along the x axis and the liquefaction depth at the front side along centreline is the maximum value at the seabed pile interface while the depth at the back side along the centreline is the minimum value of about 0 8 m which is due to the different pore pressure distribution at front and back side at this moment caused by the pile rocking effect 5 4 parametric studies on pore pressure response in this section the effects of mono pile parameters including the pile diameter and maximum rocking displacement on pore pressure response are discussed to further investigate the wssi problem considering pile rocking fig 17 shows the vertical distribution of pore water pressure at different time 5 75t 6 17t of three rocking displacements at the pile head x p 10 mm 20 mm and 40 mm the two different time corresponds to the moment when the wave trough and wave crest are close to the pile head respectively in fig 17 the corresponding maximum pore pressure for two different time is 14 kpa and 16 4 kpa and a larger amplitude of rocking displacement on pile head leads to a higher maximum pore pressure it can be seen that the change of pile rocking displacement has an obvious effect on pore pressure response around the mono pile at the upper part of seabed in addition the increase of rocking displacement imposed on the pile head increases the significance of local pore pressure enlargement fig 18 illustrates the vertical distribution of pore water pressure at different time 5 75t 6 17t of four pile diameters d 2 m 3 m 4 m and 6 m in fig 18 it can be obviously seen that the increase of pile diameter results in greater values of local pore pressure enlargements together with larger influence extent at the top of seabed in addition it enlarges the change range of pore water pressure along the vertical direction and leads to relatively larger values of pore pressure at the bottom of mono pile 6 conclusions in this study a 3d integrated numerical model has been established to investigate the interaction between seabed and mono pile subjected to dynamic wave pressures in addition the effect of pile rocking caused by wave and wind loadings in ocean environment and the rotation of wind turbine blades was considered the wave sub model is governed by varans equations and the seabed sub model is simulated by biot s qs model based on the user defined pde method on the basis of elasticity theory the pile rocking was simulated by applying a cyclic displacement on the mono pile head good agreement with former experimental and theoretical results proves the simulation accuracy of the present rocking pile model furthermore a non rocking pile model was comparatively analyzed in order to illustrate the effect of pile rocking more clearly based on the numerical results obtained the following conclusions can be made 1 the vertical distribution of pore pressure of a mono pile subjected to pile rocking is different from non rocking pile model in terms of local pressure enlargement near mudline this was attributed to the suction and compression effect induced by the mono pile and seabed motion moreover the trend of pressure decrease is slower due to increased sufficient contact between the pile and surrounding soil which leads to relatively high pore pressures in the upper soil range in addition the vertical distribution of pore pressure for both models shows good symmetry 2 the present model can better reflect the interaction between seabed and mono pile subjected to dynamic wave pressures due to larger horizontal displacements of the mono pile caused by pile rocking compared to the non rocking pile model the value of bending moment depends mainly on the horizontal displacement of the mono pile and maximum bending moment usually appears at the positon just below the mudline surface because of the seabed counter force 3 the influence of pile rocking enlarges the liquefaction zone compared to the non rocking model and the maximum liquefaction depth appears below the wave trough in addition the effect of pile rocking apparently influences the liquefaction distribution in the vicinity of mono pile 4 the change of mono pile parameters has a great influence on the interaction between mono pile and the seabed parametric studies of the pile rocking displacement and the pile diameter on pore pressure response are conducted in this research results indicate that larger rocking displacements and pile diameter lead to larger local increase of pore water pressure acknowledgments this research project is financially

23492,to simulate the fluctuating lift and resistance of the cylinder in vortex induced vibration viv accurately the shear stress transport sst turbulence model is modified in this paper then the correctness of the modified model is verified in the flow around a circular cylinder after that the numerical simulation of vortex induced vibration of a cylinder with two degrees of freedom is carried out by using the embedded program of openfoam under three different initial conditions which are uniform acceleration uniform deceleration and uniform velocity respectively after the comparison and analyses of the vibration amplitude frequency fluid force motion locus and vortex shedding we find that there are some differences in the results obtained under three initial conditions by contrast the results of uniform acceleration condition are more accurate besides the hysteresis mechanism can be analysed on the basis of the vortex shedding characteristics of uniform acceleration and deceleration in general the initial condition has a great influence on the numerical simulation of the vortex induced vibration and the validity of the modified turbulence model is further verified in the simulation keywords vortex induced vibration turbulence model initial condition hysteresis mechanism 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv is a fundamental phenomenon widely existing in many engineering fields such as the risers in offshore oil and gas exploration bridges cables antennas etc in the field of ocean engineering the viv of some cylindrical structures often appears under the effect of current this is mainly due to the phenomenon that the vortex shedding occurs when the water flows around the cylinder and the alternating vortex will produce periodic hydrodynamic loads the structural periodic vibration is one of the important causes of the fatigue damage in view of the practical significance of vortex induced vibration many scholars have been devoted to the study of the mechanism and characteristics of that lin and wang 2013 wanderley and soares 2015 kang et al 2016 cao et al 2011 govardhan and williamson 2000 investigated the amplitude response and frequency of the viv of a cylinder at reynolds number of 2000 12000 they found that there were two resonance regions of viv in the condition of low mass damping ratio and the vibration amplitude response would change with the mass ratio when the mass damping ratio is constant jauvtis and williamson 2004 found that the viv test results of single degree of freedom was similar to that of double degree of freedom when the mass ratio was 7 but when the mass ratio was 2 6 the cross flow amplitude of the two degrees of freedom produced super upper branch and its amplitude arrived at 1 5d which had never been found before pan et al 2007 carried out the numerical simulation of the cylinder at low mass damping ratio using rans code and attempted to simulate the super upper branch of viv but the final predicted vibration amplitude was smaller than the experimental value guilmineau and queutey 2004 analysed the single degree of freedom viv by numerical simulation on the basis of the low mass ratio viv model test conducted by williamson in the simulation the initial condition was set to be uniform acceleration the calculated maximum vibration amplitude of the cylinder was found to be consistent with the experimental value but the shape of the upper branch was not simulated accurately he believed that the initial condition in the numerical simulation might have an effect on the vibration characteristics in the single degree of freedom viv so it s necessary to investigate the effect of the initial condition on the characteristics of two degree of freedom viv while keeping the simulation accuracy higher one of the key points in the numerical simulation of vortex induced vibration is the selection of turbulence model celik and shaffer 1995 analysed the problem of the flow around circular cylinder by using the standard k ε turbulence model and found that there were some obvious differences between the calculated results and the test results menter 1994 proposed the sst k ω turbulence model by combining the standard k ε model and k ω model the accuracy of the sst k ω turbulence model in the simulation of flow around cylinder has a certain improvement however considering that the sst k ω turbulence model adopts the standard k ε model equations in the wake region and the standard k ε model has poor performance in the presence of abundant vortexes the improvement in the application of sst turbulence model to the numerical simulation of cylinder viv is still relatively necessary ünal et al 2010 compared and discussed the computational results of several rans turbulence models in the near wake flow of a circular cylinder pointed out that standard sst k ω model seemed to be more advantageous for the simulation accuracy but still not satisfying enough stringer et al 2014 also hold that the accuracy of the numerical simulation for a circular cylinder remained to be improved when applying the standard sst k ω turbulence model especially for the viv of the cylinder younis and przulj 2006 improved the standard k ε turbulence model in the separation flow which considered the effects of the interactions between the large scale organized periodicity of the mean flow and the random small scale high frequency motions that characterize turbulence so according to the k ε turbulence model improved by younis and przulj 2006 the modification for the standard sst k ω turbulence model which can be applied in the flows dominated by vortex shedding is a feasible idea in this paper the standard sst k ω turbulence model is improved to analyse the characteristics of the viv of a cylinder in the cfd numerical simulation in order to check the accuracy of the improved turbulence model for the simulation of fluctuating lift and drag the calculation of the flow around the cylinder is carried out using an open source software named openfoam then based on the modified turbulence model and openfoam the numerical simulation of two degree of freedom viv of a circular cylinder with a mass ratio of 2 6 is conducted under three different initial conditions which involve uniform velocity uniform acceleration and uniform deceleration after that the vibration amplitude lock in frequency fluid force trajectory and vortex shedding characteristics of the cylinder are analysed and compared under the three kinds of initial conditions on this basis the hysteresis mechanism of viv is discussed and the relationship between the vortex shedding mode and the hysteresis phenomenon under different initial conditions is studied 2 governing equations 2 1 fluid modeling in the cartesian coordinate system the fluid flow is controlled by the continuity equation and momentum equations navier stokes equations by using reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method the continuity equation and navier stokes equations can be described by celik and shaffer 1995 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 2 t ρ u i x i ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j where ρ is fluid density t is time u i and u j are the velocity vectors x i and x j are the position vectors of fluid unit p is the pressure and μ is the dynamic viscosity it should be noted that ϕ represents the average value of the variable ϕ over time and ϕ is the pulsating value the unknown turbulence variable u i u j in eq 2 are obtained here from boussinesq s linear stress strain relationship 3 u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j k where μ t is the kinematic eddy viscosity and k is the turbulence kinetic energy both given by turbulence model and δ i j is the kronecker symbol the additional equations namely turbulence model need to be introduced for the continuity equation and unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations are not closed one of the turbulence models commonly used in the problem of flow around a cylinder is the sst k ω turbulence model the characteristics of sst k ω turbulence model is discussed in section 2 2 and then it is modified by considering the expected change of the energy equilibrium due to vortex shedding 2 2 the modified turbulence model the sst k ω turbulence model uses the standard k ω model in near wall region which can well simulate the laminar flow with reverse pressure gradient on the cylinder surface however it uses the standard k ε model to deal with the flow away from the wall and it has already been mentioned that the standard k ε model fails in the prediction of flows dominated by vortex shedding in that it predicts a weaker vortex shedding intensity than that observed in measurements younis and przulj 2006 it has been widely verified by many investigations that the establishment of a vortex shedding field in a turbulent flow leads to direct energy input from the periodic mean flow oscillations into the random turbulence motions jung and park 2005 zhao 2015 zhu et al 2016 this direct energy supply occurs at a frequency that corresponds exactly to the vortex shedding frequency but it haven t been considered in the sst k ω turbulence model which leads to some diffusion errors in the numerical simulation of the vortex shedding process in unsteady separated flows the immediate implication is that in unsteady separated flows the dissipation rate equation can be modified to reflect the expected change of the energy equilibrium due to vortex shedding the specific derivation process is described below in the flow with vortex shedding the form of energy spectrum function can be taken as reynolds 1974 4 e λ t a 0 a 1 t λ s where a 0 is a constant and λ is the wavenumber vector the index s is a matching index whose precise value is immaterial to the present discussion a 1 t must vanish in the steady limit thus the turbulence kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ε can be obtained by pope cant 2000 5 k 0 e λ t d λ 6 d k d t ε by postulating a shape for e λ t based on the measured spectrum given by younis and przulj 2006 and after integration of eq 5 there results 7 k 3 s 5 2 s 1 a t λ m s 1 where λ m s 1 is the wavenumber which corresponds to the location of the vortex shedding frequency then we can take the two derivatives of kinetic energy k to get the rate of change of dissipation with time 8 d ε d t c ε 2 ε 2 k 1 s 1 ε a t d a t d t where c ε 2 is the parameter in standard k ε model with the value of 1 92 younis and przulj 2006 we can compare the above derived dissipation term with that in standard k ε model which is expressed as jones and launder 1973 9a k t u i k x j x j μ μ t σ k k x j p k ε 9b ε t u i ε x j x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j c ε 1 ε k p k c ε 2 ε 2 k where p k is the rate of production of turbulence kinetic energy and σ k σ ε c ε 1 and c ε 2 are the parameters determined by a large number of numerical simulations obviously the derived dissipation term generates an additional part which is finite only in statistically non stationary flows and influenced by the assumed form of a 1 t one of the most straightforward way to introduce this additional term into the dissipation rate equation is to redefine the coefficient c ε 1 as 10 c ε 1 c ε 1 1 β k ε 1 q k q k t where q is the mean flow kinetic energy per unit mass β is a parameter with a value of 0 38 younis and przulj 2006 we can see that an additional term has been introduced into the standard k ε model to consider the effect of the vortex shedding then by transforming the modified k ε model into the k ω form on basis of the relationship ε and ω in standard k ω model wilcox 2006 we can get the modified additional term r which can be described by 11 r β 1 q k q k t where β is a parameter obtained by numerical optimization and selected as 0 54 after a large number of test considering the sst k ω turbulence model is the combination of the standard k ε model and standard k ω model the modified additional term r can be further developed into the sst k ω turbulence model and then the modified turbulence model may be expressed as 12a d ρ k d t p k β ρ ω k x j μ σ k μ t k

where a 1 is equal to 0 31 the invariant measure of the strain rate s and parameter f 2 are defined by 14a s 2 s i j s i j 14b s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i 14c f 2 tanh max 2 k β ω y 500 μ ρ y 2 ω 2 2 3

the sst k ω turbulence model in the flow around a cylinder the numerical simulation is conducted by using the edited programming pimpledymfoam solver in openfoam meanwhile we select the calculating conditions as re 5 103 7 103 104 3 104 5 104 7 104 and 105 and control the courant number below 0 2 fig 1 shows the drag coefficients calculated by the two turbulence models and the resistance coefficient curves in the flow around a circular cylinder at different reynolds numbers drawn by zdravkoyich 1990 and esdu 1980 through the comparison and analysis we can find that both of the two calculated results are well consistent with the experimental results obtained by zdravkoyich 1990 and esdu 1980 in the re range of 5 103 7 104 in the re range of 7 104 105 the variation trend of the two calculated results are in agreement with experimental results of zdravkoyich but the accuracy of the modified model is higher than the sst k ω model the comparison of the lift coefficient curves calculated by the two turbulence models in the flow around a cylinder at different reynolds numbers and that obtained by norberg 2003 is illustrated in fig 2 after comparison we can find that the results of modified model increase with the reynolds number in the re range of 5 103 3 104 which is consistent with the results of norberg 2003 however there are some differences between the results of the sst k ω model and experimental results this is due to the modified turbulence model has introduced the improvement about the boundary layer separation which is more sensitive to vortex shedding with the increase of reynolds number the lift coefficients of sst k ω model are obviously lower than experimental results due to its lower turbulence kinetic energy generation and suppression of vortex shedding by contrast the modified model corrects the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate by introducing an additional generating term which can effectively improve the simulation accuracy of the vortex induced lift force and make the calculated results more close to the experimental results the results of the st number calculated by the two models are compared with the testing results of norberg 2003 as shown in fig 3 it can be found that the results of the two models are very close and the calculated results are slightly larger than the experimental values when the reynolds number is larger the reason about that is the modification of the model has mainly changed the relationship between the generation and dissipation terms but not changed the frequency of the vortex shedding so the st number calculated by the two models have little difference fig 4 a shows the in line velocity cloud charts calculated by the two models when the reynolds number is 104 the red curves represent the positive velocity and blue curves represent negative velocity in the cloud charts through the contrastive analysis we find both of the two models have simulated the recirculation zone but the extent of back flow of the modified model is larger than that of the standard sst k ω model moreover the vortex intensity of the modified model is larger which will promote the vortex shedding and overcome the shortcomings of the standard sst k ω model to some extent such as the low kinetic energy generation and the suppression of vortex shedding fig 4 b illustrates the pressure cloud charts of the two models similarly the red curves represent the positive pressure and the blue curves represent negative pressure as we can see from the diagram the blue curves in the lower zone are deeper indicating that the negative pressure simulated by the modified turbulence model is larger which further shows that the modified turbulence model can produce more lift to observe the extent of the recirculation region more clearly the variation curves of the in line velocity with the x d in the longitudinal symmetry plane of the cylinder at re 104 are given in fig 5 and the variation curves of the mean in line velocity and cross flow velocity with y d at the position of x d 1 04 in the wake region are given in fig 6 by comparing fig 5 it is found that the length of the recirculation region of sst k ω model is about 0 95d and that of the modified model is about 1 3d after the comparison and analysis of fig 6 we find that the absolute values of the abscissa of the modified model are significantly greater than that of the standard sst k ω model when their in line velocity or cross flow velocity are 0 which indicates that the width of the recirculation region of modified model is larger relatively moreover the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the cross flow velocity of the modified model is larger which indicates that its vortex intensity is larger this also shows the modified model can effectively correct the shortcomings of the sst k ω model about the insufficient simulation of vortex to some extent in general the modified turbulence model can simulate the generation and shedding of vortex more effectively and the vortex induced lift calculated by the modified model is more accurate than that of sst k ω model so the modified turbulence model can be further applied to the numerical simulation of vortex induced vibration 2 6 structural dynamic modeling the two degree of freedom dynamic equations of the vibrating cylinder are established via a simple mass spring system as follows 18a m x c x x k x x f d 18b m y c y y k y y f l where y is the cross flow cylinder displacement m is the structural mass c x and c y are the structural dampings in in line and cross flow directions k x and k y are the structural stiffnesses in in line and cross flow directions and f d and f l are the drag and lift using the following set of nondimensional variables x x d y y d u r u f n d m m π 4 ρ d 2 f n x f n y f n 19 x x d y y d u r u f n d m m π 4 ρ d 2 f n x f n y f n ξ x c x 2 k x m ξ y c y 2 k y m k x m 2 π f n x 2 k y m 2 π f n y 2 where x and y are the cylinder nondimensional displacements u r is the reduced velocity f n x and f n y are the natural frequencies in in line and cross flow directions which are assumed with the same value of whole natural frequency f n m is the mass ratio ξ x and ξ y are the damping ratios in two directions then the nondimensional equations of motion for the cylinder can be written as 20a x 4 π ξ x u r x 2 π u r 2 x 2 c d π m 20b y 4 π ξ y u r y 2 π u r 2 y 2 c l π m where c d and c l are drag coefficient and lift coefficient calculated by conducting an integration including both the pressure and viscous stresses on the surface of the cylinder the equations of motion are solved simultaneously with the continuity equation and the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations as well as the modified sst k ω turbulence model to compute the in line and cross flow velocity x and y necessary to impose the non slip boundary condition on the body surface and the position x and y of the cylinder necessary to place the body at the new position to regenerate the grid 3 numerical simulation of vortex induced vibration 3 1 numerical model the numerical simulation about the vortex induced vibration of a cylinder has been carried out based on the embedded program of openfoam and the simulating domain is shown in fig 7 in order to ensure the calculation accuracy with less computational time the mesh around the cylinder is encrypted locally when the mesh is divided the o type grid is applied within the range of 4d around the cylinder and the size of the grid cells gradually increases with the distance from the cylinder the structured grid is adopted in far field region as shown in fig 8 the modified turbulence model is applied in the numerical simulation of this paper the discrete methods are adopted as follows time terms are discretized by two order backward implicit euler schemes convection terms are discretized by using linear difference tvd scheme diffusion terms are discretized by gauss linear conservation scheme the solving method is pimple method 3 2 time step control and mesh independence check the time step affects the convergence speed and stability courant number which has an important influence on the turbulent flow refers to correspondence between the time step and the physical spatial scale and it can be expressed as 21 c o u r a n t n u m b e r u δ t δ x where u is the flow velocity δ t is the time step δ x is the mesh size in order to meet the courant friedrichs lewy condition the courant number must be small enough in this paper the maximum courant number value is required to be less than 0 50 and the time step δt is set as 0 0001 to check the effect of the mesh on the computed results the flow around a stationary circular cylinder is calculated by taking the re 10 4 as an example five different mesh schemes are set in the calculation and relevant parameters are shown in table 1 the calculation results of lift coefficient c l drag coefficient c d and st number by adopting different grid numbers are given in fig 9 it can be found that when the grid number is more than 51502 namely the number of mesh in scheme 3 the changes of c l c d and st number become relatively small while the variations of those in scheme 4 and 5 are very large so considering the accuracy and computational efficiency scheme 3 is chosen as the grid number in the numerical simulation 3 3 simulated condition the vortex induced vibration experiment of a cylinder with two degree of freedom conducted by javutis and williamson 2004 has been selected as a reference in this paper the mass ratio is 2 6 the diameter is 0 0381 m the mass damping ratio is 0 013 the natural frequency is 0 4 hz the reduced velocity is in the range of 2 14 and the interval of the reduced velocity is 0 2 in addition three different initial conditions are adopted in the numerical procedure as follows a uniform acceleration the reduced velocity increases gradually from 2 with an acceleration of 0 025 and after reaching the target velocity the reduced velocity is kept in the simulation for 30 cycles at the same time the physical field at the end of the flow velocity simulation is the initial condition of the next velocity simulation b uniform deceleration the reduced velocity decreases gradually from 14 with an acceleration of 0 025 also the reduced velocity is kept in the simulation for 30 cycles when reaching the target velocity the physical field at the end of the flow velocity simulation is the initial condition of the next velocity simulation c uniform the reduced velocity is given directly to the target one at the beginning of the numerical simulation after that the reduced velocity is also kept in the simulation for 30 cycles 4 comparison and analysis of the calculated results through numerical simulation of vortex induced vibration of the cylinder the comparison and analysis about the vibration amplitude response dimensionless vibration frequency fluid force characteristics motion trajectory and vortex shedding mode in three kinds of initial conditions are given as follows 4 1 analysis of the amplitude response fig 10 illustrates the variation of the cross flow amplitude of the viv with the reduced velocity under the three initial conditions through the comparison and analysis we can find the initial branch and lower branch of the amplitude response can only be simulated while the most important upper branch is absent under the uniform condition the initial branch lower branch and upper branch can be obtained under the condition of uniform deceleration but the amplitude of ur 6 reaches the maximum value of 0 96d which is quite different with the experimental results of jauvtis and williamson 2004 the initial lower and upper branches are also obtained under uniform acceleration and the simulating accuracy is higher the branch near the testing maximum amplitude 1 5d at ur 8 3 is defined as the supper upper branch by williamson the calculated maximum amplitude of ur 6 8 arrives at 1 4d under the condition of uniform acceleration which indicates the supper upper branch can be simulated by applying the uniform acceleration condition to some extent in addition the hysteresis can be simulated by combining the results of uniform acceleration with that of uniform deceleration and the hysteresis interval is ur 6 6 8 the hysteresis interval obtained by jauvtis and williamson 2004 in the model test is ur 7 8 8 6 which indicates the hysteresis of numerical simulation is ahead of that of test results but the hysteresis intervals of numerical simulation and model test have the same size which are both about 0 8 the comparison of the in line vibration amplitude is displayed in fig 11 it can be seen that only the initial and lower branches can be simulated under the uniform deceleration and uniform conditions and the accuracy of the results under uniform condition is lower by contrast the initial branch lower branch and upper branch are all simulated successfully under the uniform acceleration condition however the maximum in line amplitude of uniform acceleration condition is 0 29d which is still different from the value of 0 32d obtained by williamson in experiment in addition the hysteresis interval is also simulated by combining the results of the uniform acceleration and uniform deceleration conditions but the appearance of the interval is slightly ahead of the test value generally different initial conditions result in different amplitude responses especially in the position where the branches are changing namely nearby ur 4 ur 6 and ur 12 the initial conditions involving uniform acceleration uniform deceleration and uniform velocity have some effects on some terms in fluid governing equations at the initial stage which may lead to the differences of structure responses 4 2 analysis of the dimensionless vibration frequency the comparison of the cross flow vibration frequency data calculated in different initial conditions and obtained by williamson respectively is illustrated in fig 12 analysis of the results shows that the lock in frequency is near 1 25 under uniform deceleration and uniform velocity conditions the lock in frequency of uniform acceleration arrives at 1 33 which is very close to the experimental value of 1 35 for the range of the lock in the three initial conditions are quite different under the uniform velocity condition the lock in range of viv is ur 3 8 14 where ur 3 8 4 7 is the initial part of the upper branch and ur 4 7 14 belongs to the lower branch the lock in range is ur 4 2 12 8 under the condition of uniform deceleration in which ur 4 2 6 belongs to the upper branch and ur 6 12 8 belongs to the lower branch under the condition of uniform acceleration the lock in range is also ur 4 2 12 8 but ur 4 2 6 8 belongs to the upper branch ur 6 8 12 8 is the lower branch the hysteresis interval of ur 6 6 8 obtained by combining the uniform acceleration and deceleration conditions is slightly ahead of that of the test value which is in accordance with the results in the analysis of amplitude response besides by carrying out the double degrees of freedom viv model test of a cylinder jauvtis and williamson 2004 found that a third order lift component generated in the lock in state due to the generation of the 2t vortex shedding mode on the super upper branch to investigate this phenomenon the power spectral density curves of vibration lift and drag under the condition of uniform acceleration at ur 6 8 are shown in fig 13 we can find in addition to a dominant frequency namely the natural frequency of cross flow vibration there is a triple frequency component at the same time it can be found the lift frequency also involves a dominant frequency and a triple frequency component which is consistent with the conclusion of jauvtis and williamson 2004 the 2t vortex shedding mode generating on the super upper branch leads to the third order lift component and then the frequency of the cross flow vibration also generated the triple frequency component however there is also a fivefold frequency component in the lift frequency and it has not captured in williamson s experiment due to that it is very weak and its influence on the vibration is also slight furthermore the main frequency of in line vibration is twice the natural frequency of cross flow vibration and there is also a component frequency that is twice the main frequency the corresponding frequency of the drag shows similar characteristics with that of the lift a main frequency a double frequency component as well as a weak triple frequency component are found in the frequency of drag this shows that the 2t vortex shedding mode also has a certain impact on the in line vibration 4 3 analysis of the fluid force in fig 14 the variation curves of the mean square root of the lift coefficient and the average of the drag coefficient with the reduced velocity in three velocity forms are illustrated for the lift the variation trends of the curves under uniform deceleration and uniform acceleration conditions are consistent but the ur values of mutation are different by comparison the results of uniform velocity are larger than those of uniform deceleration and uniform acceleration when the ur is less than 5 and the position of the mutation of uniform velocity is more advanced for the drag there are some differences between the uniform deceleration and uniform acceleration when the ur is 6 8 which appears as the bifurcate shape the results of uniform velocity are obviously too small and the peak of drag is absent in this condition in addition it is found that there are also hysteresis regions about the hydrodynamic forces acting on the surface of the cylinder which is similar to the cylindrical amplitude response the hysteresis intervals of hydrodynamic forces are consistent with those of the amplitude response curves the dimensionless displacement y d x d lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d changing with time under the condition of uniform acceleration are shown in fig 15 after comparison and analysis we can find that due to the existence of initial branches at ur 3 the time domain curves of y d x d c l and c d act as the regular harmonic wave form meanwhile y d and c l as well as x d and c d are respectively in the same phase when ur 4 there are beat phenomena on the curves of y d x d c l and c d the reason about that is the transition from the initial branch to the upper branch occurs at this ur and there are two similar vibration frequencies in the process of the entry into the lock in region from the non locking region when ur 5 the vibration arrives at the upper branch completely the vibration frequency is equal to the natural frequency of the cylinder and y d and c l as well as x d and c d are in the same phase which leads to the large vibration amplitude when ur 7 the vibration is transiting from the upper branch to lower branches and in this process there is a phase shift phenomenon about the y d and c l as well as x d and c d and whether the fluid force or vibration displacement appear a suddenly decrease when ur 9 the lift coefficient curve shows a double peaks phenomenon and one of the peaks is smaller which is caused by the triple frequency component in lock in region when ur 13 the vibration has get out of the lock in region the y d x d c l and c d all reduce to very small values and y d and c l as well as x d and c d are in the reverse phase state moreover the curves of y d x d c l and c d under uniform deceleration condition are also illustrated in fig 16 in general the results are similar to that of uniform acceleration where all of the double peaks phase shift and beat phenomena are occurred the only difference is that the ur values of the phase shift and double peaks are smaller because of the hysteresis 4 4 analysis of the trajectory in order to study the evolutionary process of vibration form of viv with two degrees of freedom the motion trajectories of the cylinder at different reduced velocity should be analysed first the trajectories of the viv of the cylinder under the three initial conditions are shown in fig 17 for the uniform acceleration condition the in line vibration is stronger than the cross flow vibration when the ur 2 and the trajectory generally appears as a transverse line with the increase of ur the amplitude of cross flow vibration increases quickly and the trajectory becomes a standard 8 shape because the frequency of in line vibration is twice of that of cross flow vibration with the continuous increase of the amplitude of cross flow vibration the trajectory develops as a slender 8 shape when the upper branch occurs when ur 7 the amplitude of cross flow vibration reaches a maximum value that is about 1 4d which corresponds to the super upper branch the trajectory is pulled as a crescent shape when ur 8 the vibration turns into lower branches gradually and the trajectory becomes an extremely slender 8 shape because the decrease speed of in line amplitude is faster than that of cross flow amplitude after ur 9 the in line amplitude attenuates to a very small value so the trajectory is approximate to a vertical line besides the cross flow amplitude is also decreasing gradually and the length of the vertical line about the trajectory is reducing accordingly by contrast the trajectories of uniform deceleration condition and uniform velocity experience the shapes of the transverse line the standard 8 slender 8 and the approximate vertical line the crescent shape trajectory of super upper branch is absent under the condition of uniform deceleration and both of the slender 8 shape of upper branch and the crescent shape of super upper branch are absent under the condition of uniform velocity through the analysis of the trajectory we find the trajectory characteristics of initial branch upper branch supper upper branch and lower branch can only be simulated under the condition of uniform acceleration while there are some characteristics are absent in the simulation under the other two conditions 4 5 analysis of the vortex shedding the fluctuating lift and drag acting on the cylinder are caused by the vortex shedding fig 18 shows the vorticity nephogram of numerical simulation under the uniform acceleration condition and the dpiv nephogram of model test conducted by jauvtis and williamson 2004 after comparison and analysis it can be found that the vorticity cloud images obtained under the uniform acceleration condition are consistent with the experimental results at ur 3 corresponding to the initial branch the vortex shedding is 2s mode namely there are two vortices alternately shedding behind the cylinder within each period when ur 5 corresponding to the upper branch the vortex shedding acts as 2p mode namely there are two pairs of vortices alternately shedding behind the cylinder within each period and each pair involves two vortex when ur 6 8 corresponding to the supper upper branch vortex shedding appears as the 2t mode that is there are also two groups of vortices alternately shedding within each period but each vortex group contains three vortices at ur 8 corresponding to the lower branch the vortex shedding changes to the 2p mode again and the intensity of the two vortices in each vortex pair is equivalent according to the above analysis we can found that the variation of each branch corresponds to the change of vortex shedding mode to observe the variation of vortex shedding at each branch mutation under the conditions of uniform velocity and uniform deceleration the vorticity nephograms under the two conditions are illustrated in fig 19 and fig 20 respectively by analyzing the vorticity nephogram of the cylinder under the uniform velocity condition it is found that the vortex shedding acts as the 2p mode at ur 5 and ur 6 8 and the vortex shedding of 2p mode cannot provide the relatively large lift and drag so the upper branch is absent in the cross flow and in line amplitudes of uniform velocity in addition we can find the vortex shedding is the 2p mode at ur 6 8 by observing fig 20 a with the decrease of reduced velocity ur the effect of the ur on vortex shedding mode will gradually go beyond the scope of keeping the 2p mode then at ur 6 the vortex shedding has turn into the 2t mode which produces the larger fluctuating lift and fluctuating drag as a result the cross flow and in line amplitudes increase significantly in general the abrupt change of the vortex shedding mode under the uniform acceleration and uniform deceleration conditions leads to the abrupt change of amplitude branch besides it can be found that the vortex shedding mode in the lock in region reflects the property of inertia namely the vortex shedding mode has a tendency to maintain the original shedding mode when the role of the ur is beyond the scope of maintaining the original vortex shedding mode the shedding mode will change suddenly the difference between uniform acceleration and uniform deceleration is that the 2t mode will change to the 2p mode under uniform acceleration condition where the ur needs to exceed the scope of the maintenance of 2t mode by contrast the 2p mode will change to 2t mode under uniform deceleration condition where the ur needs to exceed the scope of the maintenance of 2p mode the ur corresponding to the abrupt change of the vortex shedding mode is different under the two conditions which produces the hysteresis phenomenon 5 conclusions in this paper to improve the accuracy of the numerical simulation of the viv about a circular cylinder the standard sst k ω turbulence model is modified by introducing an additional term then the verification of the modified turbulence model is conducted in the flow around a circular cylinder on this basis the numerical simulation of the viv of the cylinder with a mass ratio 2 6 is carried out and the amplitude of vibration lock in range fluid forces trajectory and characteristics of vortex shedding are compared and analysed respectively through the above investigations the following conclusions can be drawn 1 compared with the standard sst k ω turbulence model the calculated results of the modified turbulence model in the flow around a circular cylinder are closer to the experimental results and the size of the simulated recirculation zone as well as the vortex intensity are bigger these indicate that the modified turbulence model can overcome the disadvantages of the lower generation of turbulence kinetic energy and the suppression of vortex shedding to some extent which can improve the calculation accuracy effectively 2 the simulated results of the vibration amplitude frequency fluid forces trajectory and vortex shedding characteristics of the viv of a circular cylinder show some differences under three initial conditions by comparison the results of uniform acceleration condition are the most accurate the second is the uniform deceleration condition and the uniform condition is the worst besides the hysteresis phenomenon can be simulated by combining the results of uniform acceleration condition and uniform deceleration condition these comparisons and analyses also demonstrate that the setting of the initial condition in the numerical simulation of viv has a great effect on the simulated results in addition the modified turbulence model has been further checked in the numerical simulation generally this research will have certain reference value and guidance significance for the accurate prediction of the characteristics of the viv of cylindrical structures 3 based on the analysis of the vortex shedding mode it is found that the abrupt change of the vortex shedding mode leads to the abrupt change of the fluid forces and then the amplitude branch will change suddenly moreover the vortex shedding mode reflects the nature of inertia which is one of the internal causes of hysteresis phenomenon these results have a certain promoting effect on the research of the inherent mechanism and characteristics of the phenomena about vortex induced vibration 
23492,to simulate the fluctuating lift and resistance of the cylinder in vortex induced vibration viv accurately the shear stress transport sst turbulence model is modified in this paper then the correctness of the modified model is verified in the flow around a circular cylinder after that the numerical simulation of vortex induced vibration of a cylinder with two degrees of freedom is carried out by using the embedded program of openfoam under three different initial conditions which are uniform acceleration uniform deceleration and uniform velocity respectively after the comparison and analyses of the vibration amplitude frequency fluid force motion locus and vortex shedding we find that there are some differences in the results obtained under three initial conditions by contrast the results of uniform acceleration condition are more accurate besides the hysteresis mechanism can be analysed on the basis of the vortex shedding characteristics of uniform acceleration and deceleration in general the initial condition has a great influence on the numerical simulation of the vortex induced vibration and the validity of the modified turbulence model is further verified in the simulation keywords vortex induced vibration turbulence model initial condition hysteresis mechanism 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv is a fundamental phenomenon widely existing in many engineering fields such as the risers in offshore oil and gas exploration bridges cables antennas etc in the field of ocean engineering the viv of some cylindrical structures often appears under the effect of current this is mainly due to the phenomenon that the vortex shedding occurs when the water flows around the cylinder and the alternating vortex will produce periodic hydrodynamic loads the structural periodic vibration is one of the important causes of the fatigue damage in view of the practical significance of vortex induced vibration many scholars have been devoted to the study of the mechanism and characteristics of that lin and wang 2013 wanderley and soares 2015 kang et al 2016 cao et al 2011 govardhan and williamson 2000 investigated the amplitude response and frequency of the viv of a cylinder at reynolds number of 2000 12000 they found that there were two resonance regions of viv in the condition of low mass damping ratio and the vibration amplitude response would change with the mass ratio when the mass damping ratio is constant jauvtis and williamson 2004 found that the viv test results of single degree of freedom was similar to that of double degree of freedom when the mass ratio was 7 but when the mass ratio was 2 6 the cross flow amplitude of the two degrees of freedom produced super upper branch and its amplitude arrived at 1 5d which had never been found before pan et al 2007 carried out the numerical simulation of the cylinder at low mass damping ratio using rans code and attempted to simulate the super upper branch of viv but the final predicted vibration amplitude was smaller than the experimental value guilmineau and queutey 2004 analysed the single degree of freedom viv by numerical simulation on the basis of the low mass ratio viv model test conducted by williamson in the simulation the initial condition was set to be uniform acceleration the calculated maximum vibration amplitude of the cylinder was found to be consistent with the experimental value but the shape of the upper branch was not simulated accurately he believed that the initial condition in the numerical simulation might have an effect on the vibration characteristics in the single degree of freedom viv so it s necessary to investigate the effect of the initial condition on the characteristics of two degree of freedom viv while keeping the simulation accuracy higher one of the key points in the numerical simulation of vortex induced vibration is the selection of turbulence model celik and shaffer 1995 analysed the problem of the flow around circular cylinder by using the standard k ε turbulence model and found that there were some obvious differences between the calculated results and the test results menter 1994 proposed the sst k ω turbulence model by combining the standard k ε model and k ω model the accuracy of the sst k ω turbulence model in the simulation of flow around cylinder has a certain improvement however considering that the sst k ω turbulence model adopts the standard k ε model equations in the wake region and the standard k ε model has poor performance in the presence of abundant vortexes the improvement in the application of sst turbulence model to the numerical simulation of cylinder viv is still relatively necessary ünal et al 2010 compared and discussed the computational results of several rans turbulence models in the near wake flow of a circular cylinder pointed out that standard sst k ω model seemed to be more advantageous for the simulation accuracy but still not satisfying enough stringer et al 2014 also hold that the accuracy of the numerical simulation for a circular cylinder remained to be improved when applying the standard sst k ω turbulence model especially for the viv of the cylinder younis and przulj 2006 improved the standard k ε turbulence model in the separation flow which considered the effects of the interactions between the large scale organized periodicity of the mean flow and the random small scale high frequency motions that characterize turbulence so according to the k ε turbulence model improved by younis and przulj 2006 the modification for the standard sst k ω turbulence model which can be applied in the flows dominated by vortex shedding is a feasible idea in this paper the standard sst k ω turbulence model is improved to analyse the characteristics of the viv of a cylinder in the cfd numerical simulation in order to check the accuracy of the improved turbulence model for the simulation of fluctuating lift and drag the calculation of the flow around the cylinder is carried out using an open source software named openfoam then based on the modified turbulence model and openfoam the numerical simulation of two degree of freedom viv of a circular cylinder with a mass ratio of 2 6 is conducted under three different initial conditions which involve uniform velocity uniform acceleration and uniform deceleration after that the vibration amplitude lock in frequency fluid force trajectory and vortex shedding characteristics of the cylinder are analysed and compared under the three kinds of initial conditions on this basis the hysteresis mechanism of viv is discussed and the relationship between the vortex shedding mode and the hysteresis phenomenon under different initial conditions is studied 2 governing equations 2 1 fluid modeling in the cartesian coordinate system the fluid flow is controlled by the continuity equation and momentum equations navier stokes equations by using reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method the continuity equation and navier stokes equations can be described by celik and shaffer 1995 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 2 t ρ u i x i ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j where ρ is fluid density t is time u i and u j are the velocity vectors x i and x j are the position vectors of fluid unit p is the pressure and μ is the dynamic viscosity it should be noted that ϕ represents the average value of the variable ϕ over time and ϕ is the pulsating value the unknown turbulence variable u i u j in eq 2 are obtained here from boussinesq s linear stress strain relationship 3 u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j k where μ t is the kinematic eddy viscosity and k is the turbulence kinetic energy both given by turbulence model and δ i j is the kronecker symbol the additional equations namely turbulence model need to be introduced for the continuity equation and unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations are not closed one of the turbulence models commonly used in the problem of flow around a cylinder is the sst k ω turbulence model the characteristics of sst k ω turbulence model is discussed in section 2 2 and then it is modified by considering the expected change of the energy equilibrium due to vortex shedding 2 2 the modified turbulence model the sst k ω turbulence model uses the standard k ω model in near wall region which can well simulate the laminar flow with reverse pressure gradient on the cylinder surface however it uses the standard k ε model to deal with the flow away from the wall and it has already been mentioned that the standard k ε model fails in the prediction of flows dominated by vortex shedding in that it predicts a weaker vortex shedding intensity than that observed in measurements younis and przulj 2006 it has been widely verified by many investigations that the establishment of a vortex shedding field in a turbulent flow leads to direct energy input from the periodic mean flow oscillations into the random turbulence motions jung and park 2005 zhao 2015 zhu et al 2016 this direct energy supply occurs at a frequency that corresponds exactly to the vortex shedding frequency but it haven t been considered in the sst k ω turbulence model which leads to some diffusion errors in the numerical simulation of the vortex shedding process in unsteady separated flows the immediate implication is that in unsteady separated flows the dissipation rate equation can be modified to reflect the expected change of the energy equilibrium due to vortex shedding the specific derivation process is described below in the flow with vortex shedding the form of energy spectrum function can be taken as reynolds 1974 4 e λ t a 0 a 1 t λ s where a 0 is a constant and λ is the wavenumber vector the index s is a matching index whose precise value is immaterial to the present discussion a 1 t must vanish in the steady limit thus the turbulence kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ε can be obtained by pope cant 2000 5 k 0 e λ t d λ 6 d k d t ε by postulating a shape for e λ t based on the measured spectrum given by younis and przulj 2006 and after integration of eq 5 there results 7 k 3 s 5 2 s 1 a t λ m s 1 where λ m s 1 is the wavenumber which corresponds to the location of the vortex shedding frequency then we can take the two derivatives of kinetic energy k to get the rate of change of dissipation with time 8 d ε d t c ε 2 ε 2 k 1 s 1 ε a t d a t d t where c ε 2 is the parameter in standard k ε model with the value of 1 92 younis and przulj 2006 we can compare the above derived dissipation term with that in standard k ε model which is expressed as jones and launder 1973 9a k t u i k x j x j μ μ t σ k k x j p k ε 9b ε t u i ε x j x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j c ε 1 ε k p k c ε 2 ε 2 k where p k is the rate of production of turbulence kinetic energy and σ k σ ε c ε 1 and c ε 2 are the parameters determined by a large number of numerical simulations obviously the derived dissipation term generates an additional part which is finite only in statistically non stationary flows and influenced by the assumed form of a 1 t one of the most straightforward way to introduce this additional term into the dissipation rate equation is to redefine the coefficient c ε 1 as 10 c ε 1 c ε 1 1 β k ε 1 q k q k t where q is the mean flow kinetic energy per unit mass β is a parameter with a value of 0 38 younis and przulj 2006 we can see that an additional term has been introduced into the standard k ε model to consider the effect of the vortex shedding then by transforming the modified k ε model into the k ω form on basis of the relationship ε and ω in standard k ω model wilcox 2006 we can get the modified additional term r which can be described by 11 r β 1 q k q k t where β is a parameter obtained by numerical optimization and selected as 0 54 after a large number of test considering the sst k ω turbulence model is the combination of the standard k ε model and standard k ω model the modified additional term r can be further developed into the sst k ω turbulence model and then the modified turbulence model may be expressed as 12a d ρ k d t p k β ρ ω k x j μ σ k μ t k

the sst k ω turbulence model in the flow around a cylinder the numerical simulation is conducted by using the edited programming pimpledymfoam solver in openfoam meanwhile we select the calculating conditions as re 5 103 7 103 104 3 104 5 104 7 104 and 105 and control the courant number below 0 2 fig 1 shows the drag coefficients calculated by the two turbulence models and the resistance coefficient curves in the flow around a circular cylinder at different reynolds numbers drawn by zdravkoyich 1990 and esdu 1980 through the comparison and analysis we can find that both of the two calculated results are well consistent with the experimental results obtained by zdravkoyich 1990 and esdu 1980 in the re range of 5 103 7 104 in the re range of 7 104 105 the variation trend of the two calculated results are in agreement with experimental results of zdravkoyich but the accuracy of the modified model is higher than the sst k ω model the comparison of the lift coefficient curves calculated by the two turbulence models in the flow around a cylinder at different reynolds numbers and that obtained by norberg 2003 is illustrated in fig 2 after comparison we can find that the results of modified model increase with the reynolds number in the re range of 5 103 3 104 which is consistent with the results of norberg 2003 however there are some differences between the results of the sst k ω model and experimental results this is due to the modified turbulence model has introduced the improvement about the boundary layer separation which is more sensitive to vortex shedding with the increase of reynolds number the lift coefficients of sst k ω model are obviously lower than experimental results due to its lower turbulence kinetic energy generation and suppression of vortex shedding by contrast the modified model corrects the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate by introducing an additional generating term which can effectively improve the simulation accuracy of the vortex induced lift force and make the calculated results more close to the experimental results the results of the st number calculated by the two models are compared with the testing results of norberg 2003 as shown in fig 3 it can be found that the results of the two models are very close and the calculated results are slightly larger than the experimental values when the reynolds number is larger the reason about that is the modification of the model has mainly changed the relationship between the generation and dissipation terms but not changed the frequency of the vortex shedding so the st number calculated by the two models have little difference fig 4 a shows the in line velocity cloud charts calculated by the two models when the reynolds number is 104 the red curves represent the positive velocity and blue curves represent negative velocity in the cloud charts through the contrastive analysis we find both of the two models have simulated the recirculation zone but the extent of back flow of the modified model is larger than that of the standard sst k ω model moreover the vortex intensity of the modified model is larger which will promote the vortex shedding and overcome the shortcomings of the standard sst k ω model to some extent such as the low kinetic energy generation and the suppression of vortex shedding fig 4 b illustrates the pressure cloud charts of the two models similarly the red curves represent the positive pressure and the blue curves represent negative pressure as we can see from the diagram the blue curves in the lower zone are deeper indicating that the negative pressure simulated by the modified turbulence model is larger which further shows that the modified turbulence model can produce more lift to observe the extent of the recirculation region more clearly the variation curves of the in line velocity with the x d in the longitudinal symmetry plane of the cylinder at re 104 are given in fig 5 and the variation curves of the mean in line velocity and cross flow velocity with y d at the position of x d 1 04 in the wake region are given in fig 6 by comparing fig 5 it is found that the length of the recirculation region of sst k ω model is about 0 95d and that of the modified model is about 1 3d after the comparison and analysis of fig 6 we find that the absolute values of the abscissa of the modified model are significantly greater than that of the standard sst k ω model when their in line velocity or cross flow velocity are 0 which indicates that the width of the recirculation region of modified model is larger relatively moreover the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the cross flow velocity of the modified model is larger which indicates that its vortex intensity is larger this also shows the modified model can effectively correct the shortcomings of the sst k ω model about the insufficient simulation of vortex to some extent in general the modified turbulence model can simulate the generation and shedding of vortex more effectively and the vortex induced lift calculated by the modified model is more accurate than that of sst k ω model so the modified turbulence model can be further applied to the numerical simulation of vortex induced vibration 2 6 structural dynamic modeling the two degree of freedom dynamic equations of the vibrating cylinder are established via a simple mass spring system as follows 18a m x c x x k x x f d 18b m y c y y k y y f l where y is the cross flow cylinder displacement m is the structural mass c x and c y are the structural dampings in in line and cross flow directions k x and k y are the structural stiffnesses in in line and cross flow directions and f d and f l are the drag and lift using the following set of nondimensional variables x x d y y d u r u f n d m m π 4 ρ d 2 f n x f n y f n 19 x x d y y d u r u f n d m m π 4 ρ d 2 f n x f n y f n ξ x c x 2 k x m ξ y c y 2 k y m k x m 2 π f n x 2 k y m 2 π f n y 2 where x and y are the cylinder nondimensional displacements u r is the reduced velocity f n x and f n y are the natural frequencies in in line and cross flow directions which are assumed with the same value of whole natural frequency f n m is the mass ratio ξ x and ξ y are the damping ratios in two directions then the nondimensional equations of motion for the cylinder can be written as 20a x 4 π ξ x u r x 2 π u r 2 x 2 c d π m 20b y 4 π ξ y u r y 2 π u r 2 y 2 c l π m where c d and c l are drag coefficient and lift coefficient calculated by conducting an integration including both the pressure and viscous stresses on the surface of the cylinder the equations of motion are solved simultaneously with the continuity equation and the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations as well as the modified sst k ω turbulence model to compute the in line and cross flow velocity x and y necessary to impose the non slip boundary condition on the body surface and the position x and y of the cylinder necessary to place the body at the new position to regenerate the grid 3 numerical simulation of vortex induced vibration 3 1 numerical model the numerical simulation about the vortex induced vibration of a cylinder has been carried out based on the embedded program of openfoam and the simulating domain is shown in fig 7 in order to ensure the calculation accuracy with less computational time the mesh around the cylinder is encrypted locally when the mesh is divided the o type grid is applied within the range of 4d around the cylinder and the size of the grid cells gradually increases with the distance from the cylinder the structured grid is adopted in far field region as shown in fig 8 the modified turbulence model is applied in the numerical simulation of this paper the discrete methods are adopted as follows time terms are discretized by two order backward implicit euler schemes convection terms are discretized by using linear difference tvd scheme diffusion terms are discretized by gauss linear conservation scheme the solving method is pimple method 3 2 time step control and mesh independence check the time step affects the convergence speed and stability courant number which has an important influence on the turbulent flow refers to correspondence between the time step and the physical spatial scale and it can be expressed as 21 c o u r a n t n u m b e r u δ t δ x where u is the flow velocity δ t is the time step δ x is the mesh size in order to meet the courant friedrichs lewy condition the courant number must be small enough in this paper the maximum courant number value is required to be less than 0 50 and the time step δt is set as 0 0001 to check the effect of the mesh on the computed results the flow around a stationary circular cylinder is calculated by taking the re 10 4 as an example five different mesh schemes are set in the calculation and relevant parameters are shown in table 1 the calculation results of lift coefficient c l drag coefficient c d and st number by adopting different grid numbers are given in fig 9 it can be found that when the grid number is more than 51502 namely the number of mesh in scheme 3 the changes of c l c d and st number become relatively small while the variations of those in scheme 4 and 5 are very large so considering the accuracy and computational efficiency scheme 3 is chosen as the grid number in the numerical simulation 3 3 simulated condition the vortex induced vibration experiment of a cylinder with two degree of freedom conducted by javutis and williamson 2004 has been selected as a reference in this paper the mass ratio is 2 6 the diameter is 0 0381 m the mass damping ratio is 0 013 the natural frequency is 0 4 hz the reduced velocity is in the range of 2 14 and the interval of the reduced velocity is 0 2 in addition three different initial conditions are adopted in the numerical procedure as follows a uniform acceleration the reduced velocity increases gradually from 2 with an acceleration of 0 025 and after reaching the target velocity the reduced velocity is kept in the simulation for 30 cycles at the same time the physical field at the end of the flow velocity simulation is the initial condition of the next velocity simulation b uniform deceleration the reduced velocity decreases gradually from 14 with an acceleration of 0 025 also the reduced velocity is kept in the simulation for 30 cycles when reaching the target velocity the physical field at the end of the flow velocity simulation is the initial condition of the next velocity simulation c uniform the reduced velocity is given directly to the target one at the beginning of the numerical simulation after that the reduced velocity is also kept in the simulation for 30 cycles 4 comparison and analysis of the calculated results through numerical simulation of vortex induced vibration of the cylinder the comparison and analysis about the vibration amplitude response dimensionless vibration frequency fluid force characteristics motion trajectory and vortex shedding mode in three kinds of initial conditions are given as follows 4 1 analysis of the amplitude response fig 10 illustrates the variation of the cross flow amplitude of the viv with the reduced velocity under the three initial conditions through the comparison and analysis we can find the initial branch and lower branch of the amplitude response can only be simulated while the most important upper branch is absent under the uniform condition the initial branch lower branch and upper branch can be obtained under the condition of uniform deceleration but the amplitude of ur 6 reaches the maximum value of 0 96d which is quite different with the experimental results of jauvtis and williamson 2004 the initial lower and upper branches are also obtained under uniform acceleration and the simulating accuracy is higher the branch near the testing maximum amplitude 1 5d at ur 8 3 is defined as the supper upper branch by williamson the calculated maximum amplitude of ur 6 8 arrives at 1 4d under the condition of uniform acceleration which indicates the supper upper branch can be simulated by applying the uniform acceleration condition to some extent in addition the hysteresis can be simulated by combining the results of uniform acceleration with that of uniform deceleration and the hysteresis interval is ur 6 6 8 the hysteresis interval obtained by jauvtis and williamson 2004 in the model test is ur 7 8 8 6 which indicates the hysteresis of numerical simulation is ahead of that of test results but the hysteresis intervals of numerical simulation and model test have the same size which are both about 0 8 the comparison of the in line vibration amplitude is displayed in fig 11 it can be seen that only the initial and lower branches can be simulated under the uniform deceleration and uniform conditions and the accuracy of the results under uniform condition is lower by contrast the initial branch lower branch and upper branch are all simulated successfully under the uniform acceleration condition however the maximum in line amplitude of uniform acceleration condition is 0 29d which is still different from the value of 0 32d obtained by williamson in experiment in addition the hysteresis interval is also simulated by combining the results of the uniform acceleration and uniform deceleration conditions but the appearance of the interval is slightly ahead of the test value generally different initial conditions result in different amplitude responses especially in the position where the branches are changing namely nearby ur 4 ur 6 and ur 12 the initial conditions involving uniform acceleration uniform deceleration and uniform velocity have some effects on some terms in fluid governing equations at the initial stage which may lead to the differences of structure responses 4 2 analysis of the dimensionless vibration frequency the comparison of the cross flow vibration frequency data calculated in different initial conditions and obtained by williamson respectively is illustrated in fig 12 analysis of the results shows that the lock in frequency is near 1 25 under uniform deceleration and uniform velocity conditions the lock in frequency of uniform acceleration arrives at 1 33 which is very close to the experimental value of 1 35 for the range of the lock in the three initial conditions are quite different under the uniform velocity condition the lock in range of viv is ur 3 8 14 where ur 3 8 4 7 is the initial part of the upper branch and ur 4 7 14 belongs to the lower branch the lock in range is ur 4 2 12 8 under the condition of uniform deceleration in which ur 4 2 6 belongs to the upper branch and ur 6 12 8 belongs to the lower branch under the condition of uniform acceleration the lock in range is also ur 4 2 12 8 but ur 4 2 6 8 belongs to the upper branch ur 6 8 12 8 is the lower branch the hysteresis interval of ur 6 6 8 obtained by combining the uniform acceleration and deceleration conditions is slightly ahead of that of the test value which is in accordance with the results in the analysis of amplitude response besides by carrying out the double degrees of freedom viv model test of a cylinder jauvtis and williamson 2004 found that a third order lift component generated in the lock in state due to the generation of the 2t vortex shedding mode on the super upper branch to investigate this phenomenon the power spectral density curves of vibration lift and drag under the condition of uniform acceleration at ur 6 8 are shown in fig 13 we can find in addition to a dominant frequency namely the natural frequency of cross flow vibration there is a triple frequency component at the same time it can be found the lift frequency also involves a dominant frequency and a triple frequency component which is consistent with the conclusion of jauvtis and williamson 2004 the 2t vortex shedding mode generating on the super upper branch leads to the third order lift component and then the frequency of the cross flow vibration also generated the triple frequency component however there is also a fivefold frequency component in the lift frequency and it has not captured in williamson s experiment due to that it is very weak and its influence on the vibration is also slight furthermore the main frequency of in line vibration is twice the natural frequency of cross flow vibration and there is also a component frequency that is twice the main frequency the corresponding frequency of the drag shows similar characteristics with that of the lift a main frequency a double frequency component as well as a weak triple frequency component are found in the frequency of drag this shows that the 2t vortex shedding mode also has a certain impact on the in line vibration 4 3 analysis of the fluid force in fig 14 the variation curves of the mean square root of the lift coefficient and the average of the drag coefficient with the reduced velocity in three velocity forms are illustrated for the lift the variation trends of the curves under uniform deceleration and uniform acceleration conditions are consistent but the ur values of mutation are different by comparison the results of uniform velocity are larger than those of uniform deceleration and uniform acceleration when the ur is less than 5 and the position of the mutation of uniform velocity is more advanced for the drag there are some differences between the uniform deceleration and uniform acceleration when the ur is 6 8 which appears as the bifurcate shape the results of uniform velocity are obviously too small and the peak of drag is absent in this condition in addition it is found that there are also hysteresis regions about the hydrodynamic forces acting on the surface of the cylinder which is similar to the cylindrical amplitude response the hysteresis intervals of hydrodynamic forces are consistent with those of the amplitude response curves the dimensionless displacement y d x d lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d changing with time under the condition of uniform acceleration are shown in fig 15 after comparison and analysis we can find that due to the existence of initial branches at ur 3 the time domain curves of y d x d c l and c d act as the regular harmonic wave form meanwhile y d and c l as well as x d and c d are respectively in the same phase when ur 4 there are beat phenomena on the curves of y d x d c l and c d the reason about that is the transition from the initial branch to the upper branch occurs at this ur and there are two similar vibration frequencies in the process of the entry into the lock in region from the non locking region when ur 5 the vibration arrives at the upper branch completely the vibration frequency is equal to the natural frequency of the cylinder and y d and c l as well as x d and c d are in the same phase which leads to the large vibration amplitude when ur 7 the vibration is transiting from the upper branch to lower branches and in this process there is a phase shift phenomenon about the y d and c l as well as x d and c d and whether the fluid force or vibration displacement appear a suddenly decrease when ur 9 the lift coefficient curve shows a double peaks phenomenon and one of the peaks is smaller which is caused by the triple frequency component in lock in region when ur 13 the vibration has get out of the lock in region the y d x d c l and c d all reduce to very small values and y d and c l as well as x d and c d are in the reverse phase state moreover the curves of y d x d c l and c d under uniform deceleration condition are also illustrated in fig 16 in general the results are similar to that of uniform acceleration where all of the double peaks phase shift and beat phenomena are occurred the only difference is that the ur values of the phase shift and double peaks are smaller because of the hysteresis 4 4 analysis of the trajectory in order to study the evolutionary process of vibration form of viv with two degrees of freedom the motion trajectories of the cylinder at different reduced velocity should be analysed first the trajectories of the viv of the cylinder under the three initial conditions are shown in fig 17 for the uniform acceleration condition the in line vibration is stronger than the cross flow vibration when the ur 2 and the trajectory generally appears as a transverse line with the increase of ur the amplitude of cross flow vibration increases quickly and the trajectory becomes a standard 8 shape because the frequency of in line vibration is twice of that of cross flow vibration with the continuous increase of the amplitude of cross flow vibration the trajectory develops as a slender 8 shape when the upper branch occurs when ur 7 the amplitude of cross flow vibration reaches a maximum value that is about 1 4d which corresponds to the super upper branch the trajectory is pulled as a crescent shape when ur 8 the vibration turns into lower branches gradually and the trajectory becomes an extremely slender 8 shape because the decrease speed of in line amplitude is faster than that of cross flow amplitude after ur 9 the in line amplitude attenuates to a very small value so the trajectory is approximate to a vertical line besides the cross flow amplitude is also decreasing gradually and the length of the vertical line about the trajectory is reducing accordingly by contrast the trajectories of uniform deceleration condition and uniform velocity experience the shapes of the transverse line the standard 8 slender 8 and the approximate vertical line the crescent shape trajectory of super upper branch is absent under the condition of uniform deceleration and both of the slender 8 shape of upper branch and the crescent shape of super upper branch are absent under the condition of uniform velocity through the analysis of the trajectory we find the trajectory characteristics of initial branch upper branch supper upper branch and lower branch can only be simulated under the condition of uniform acceleration while there are some characteristics are absent in the simulation under the other two conditions 4 5 analysis of the vortex shedding the fluctuating lift and drag acting on the cylinder are caused by the vortex shedding fig 18 shows the vorticity nephogram of numerical simulation under the uniform acceleration condition and the dpiv nephogram of model test conducted by jauvtis and williamson 2004 after comparison and analysis it can be found that the vorticity cloud images obtained under the uniform acceleration condition are consistent with the experimental results at ur 3 corresponding to the initial branch the vortex shedding is 2s mode namely there are two vortices alternately shedding behind the cylinder within each period when ur 5 corresponding to the upper branch the vortex shedding acts as 2p mode namely there are two pairs of vortices alternately shedding behind the cylinder within each period and each pair involves two vortex when ur 6 8 corresponding to the supper upper branch vortex shedding appears as the 2t mode that is there are also two groups of vortices alternately shedding within each period but each vortex group contains three vortices at ur 8 corresponding to the lower branch the vortex shedding changes to the 2p mode again and the intensity of the two vortices in each vortex pair is equivalent according to the above analysis we can found that the variation of each branch corresponds to the change of vortex shedding mode to observe the variation of vortex shedding at each branch mutation under the conditions of uniform velocity and uniform deceleration the vorticity nephograms under the two conditions are illustrated in fig 19 and fig 20 respectively by analyzing the vorticity nephogram of the cylinder under the uniform velocity condition it is found that the vortex shedding acts as the 2p mode at ur 5 and ur 6 8 and the vortex shedding of 2p mode cannot provide the relatively large lift and drag so the upper branch is absent in the cross flow and in line amplitudes of uniform velocity in addition we can find the vortex shedding is the 2p mode at ur 6 8 by observing fig 20 a with the decrease of reduced velocity ur the effect of the ur on vortex shedding mode will gradually go beyond the scope of keeping the 2p mode then at ur 6 the vortex shedding has turn into the 2t mode which produces the larger fluctuating lift and fluctuating drag as a result the cross flow and in line amplitudes increase significantly in general the abrupt change of the vortex shedding mode under the uniform acceleration and uniform deceleration conditions leads to the abrupt change of amplitude branch besides it can be found that the vortex shedding mode in the lock in region reflects the property of inertia namely the vortex shedding mode has a tendency to maintain the original shedding mode when the role of the ur is beyond the scope of maintaining the original vortex shedding mode the shedding mode will change suddenly the difference between uniform acceleration and uniform deceleration is that the 2t mode will change to the 2p mode under uniform acceleration condition where the ur needs to exceed the scope of the maintenance of 2t mode by contrast the 2p mode will change to 2t mode under uniform deceleration condition where the ur needs to exceed the scope of the maintenance of 2p mode the ur corresponding to the abrupt change of the vortex shedding mode is different under the two conditions which produces the hysteresis phenomenon 5 conclusions in this paper to improve the accuracy of the numerical simulation of the viv about a circular cylinder the standard sst k ω turbulence model is modified by introducing an additional term then the verification of the modified turbulence model is conducted in the flow around a circular cylinder on this basis the numerical simulation of the viv of the cylinder with a mass ratio 2 6 is carried out and the amplitude of vibration lock in range fluid forces trajectory and characteristics of vortex shedding are compared and analysed respectively through the above investigations the following conclusions can be drawn 1 compared with the standard sst k ω turbulence model the calculated results of the modified turbulence model in the flow around a circular cylinder are closer to the experimental results and the size of the simulated recirculation zone as well as the vortex intensity are bigger these indicate that the modified turbulence model can overcome the disadvantages of the lower generation of turbulence kinetic energy and the suppression of vortex shedding to some extent which can improve the calculation accuracy effectively 2 the simulated results of the vibration amplitude frequency fluid forces trajectory and vortex shedding characteristics of the viv of a circular cylinder show some differences under three initial conditions by comparison the results of uniform acceleration condition are the most accurate the second is the uniform deceleration condition and the uniform condition is the worst besides the hysteresis phenomenon can be simulated by combining the results of uniform acceleration condition and uniform deceleration condition these comparisons and analyses also demonstrate that the setting of the initial condition in the numerical simulation of viv has a great effect on the simulated results in addition the modified turbulence model has been further checked in the numerical simulation generally this research will have certain reference value and guidance significance for the accurate prediction of the characteristics of the viv of cylindrical structures 3 based on the analysis of the vortex shedding mode it is found that the abrupt change of the vortex shedding mode leads to the abrupt change of the fluid forces and then the amplitude branch will change suddenly moreover the vortex shedding mode reflects the nature of inertia which is one of the internal causes of hysteresis phenomenon these results have a certain promoting effect on the research of the inherent mechanism and characteristics of the phenomena about vortex induced vibration

suitable tools to investigate processes are required to support a sustainable management of ship traffic this work tests a new methodology based on a numerical model chain that reproduces the hydrodynamic field close to the ship hull and the ship induced wave propagation in the surrounding shallow areas the model chain includes an unstructured hydrodynamic model forced by the near field estimation of a computational fluid dynamics simulation the modeling system has been applied to a major navigation channel and surrounding tidal flats in the venice lagoon italy field observations and a theoretical framework were used to characterize the ship waves and to validate the modeling system results show that the deeper the initial depression the larger the dissipation over the tidal flat

venice lagoon 1 introduction shipping is undoubtedly the most efficient way of transporting goods worldwide however there are mounting concerns about the impacts of the global traffic on the marine environment both off shore and on shore zheng et al 2016 besides pollution and underwater noise ship traffic in coastal areas can represent one of the major inputs of energy in form of disturbance of the hydrodynamic field which can become a dominant forcing for the morphodynamics of sheltered areas soomere 2005 moreover waterways are conveniently located in transitional systems like estuaries and

impacts of navigation critical aspects of monitoring and modeling ship waves in shallow water coastal systems are linked with the intrinsic complexity of the process and the variety of morphological features like natural and artificial channels tidal flats and salt marshes when a vessel is moving in a confined channel the wave pattern produced is the result of the interaction between the

water this angle is fixed and it is equal to 19 28 for a ship advancing in finite depth sea the kelvin angle depends on the water depth and the ship speed the depth based froude number f r h v g h where v is the ship speed g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the water depth newman 1977 can help in distinguishing the different waves propagating from the hull in shallow channels like the considered one the limited navigation speed leads to fr h 1 in these conditions the most significant perturbation is connected to the lateral depression waves while kelvin waves usually generated in deep waters are negligible rapaglia et al 2011 these asymmetric non linear v shaped depression waves propagate on the shallows rodin et al 2015 parnell et al 2015 as far as the modeling is concerned previous studies address the investigation of ship hydrodynamics from different perspectives and with different aims most of the works are focused on the near field analysis i e a region around the vessels of the order of one ship length applications considering vessels operating in open sea as for example visonneau et al 2016 carrica et al 2016 broglia et al 2015 dubbioso et al 2017 and hirdaris et al 2016 interacting with the surrounding background field e g mousaviraad et al 2015 volpi et al 2016 carrica et al 2008 shibata et al 2012 and advancing in confined channels e g rodin et al 2015 eloot and vantorre 2011 dam et al 2008 fleit et al 2016 torsvik et al 2009 can be mentioned both experimental fluid dynamics efd tests and computational fluid dynamics cfd models are commonly used for an overview of the state of the art on this topic the interested reader can refer to the latest workshops on marine hydrodynamics and related topics salvatore et al 2015 larsson et al 2013 simonsen et al 2014 these studies are mainly focused on local small scale interaction between the hull and the surrounding water and rarely does the investigation involve far field hydrodynamics the main advantage of these models is the high resolution and the capability to reproduce small scale and turbulent processes close to the hull as well as wave pattern providing a useful indication for ship maneuverability sea keeping and in general naval hydrodynamics related problems navigation in confined water either shallow or restricted waterways and hydrodynamic interactions due to the passage of multiple ships are also interesting research topics different numerical approaches are commonly used ranging from the boussinesq 2d models e g nascimento et al 2011 dam et al 2008 to 3d models e g yuan et al 2016 yao and dong 2016 and cfd based tools e g mousaviraad et al 2016a as well as combined efd studies and cfd implementations e g eloot and vantorre 2011 fleit et al 2016 mousaviraad et al 2016b however due to the high computational resources required cfd tools cannot be deemed as the most suitable and efficient approach for the investigation of the propagation of the ship generated waves in the far field rather the use of simplified models has to be considered the existing literature provides several examples of these models which consider the channel borders investigating the effects of the ship passage on the surrounding shallow areas generally adopting idealized and synthetically produced characteristic wave crest e g torsvik et al 2009 dam et al 2008 rodrigues et al 2015 modeling applications that studied the propagation of the wave through linear weakly non linear or highly non linear wave theories can be mentioned some implementations have recently been performed along a channel section giving a 1d description of processes rodin et al 2015 parnell et al 2015 therefore the contribution on the 2d field of different areas of the ship was not considered not reproducing the background field interactions and approximating the vertical effects of bottom structures these assumptions could lead to small inconsistencies in comparison with measured data like time shifts due to oblique wave interferences therefore by examining the existing literature a double need arises to properly reproduce the wave pattern around the hull specifically the depression wave in its 2d pattern and to evaluate its propagation outside the channel borders this work presents a multi model tool suitable for simulating ship induced waves in shallow water systems the proposed approach considers a high fidelity unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations model to accurately describe the flow field inside the channel in the proximity of the vessel coupled with a finite element hydrodynamic model that reproduces the depression wave propagation in the surrounding shallow water area the model chain has been applied to the venice lagoon and validated against observations acquired in its major waterway and the surrounding tidal flats 2 methods the modeling chain the numerical model chain used to investigate the hydrodynamic effects determined by the passage of ships in a channel surrounded by tidal flats is composed of a cfd solver xnavis that provides steady state velocity and water level fields in a limited area around the ship hull within the channel and a 3d hydrodynamic finite element model shyfem forced by the cfd field along a moving trajectory 2 1 xnavis model the hydrodynamic field that originates around the ship hull advancing straight ahead in a rectilinear channel is computed by the numerical solution of the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations which can be written in integral form as 1 s v u n d s 0 t v u d v s v f c f d n d s 0 where v is the control volume s v its boundary and n the vector normal to s v directed outside the volume the equations are written in an inertial reference system and are made non dimensional through a reference velocity the free stream velocity u 0 a reference length the ship length lpp and the water density ρ 1026 021 kg m3 in the following results will be discussed in the dimensional form fc and fd represent the non viscous advection and pressure contribution and viscous fluxes respectively 2 f c p i u u f d 1 r e ν t u u t where p is a new

kinematic viscosity ν 1 189 10 6m2 s ν t is the non dimensional turbulent viscosity that can be computed by means of several turbulence models implemented in the solver mathematically the system of equation 1 must be completed by appropriate conditions at physical and computational boundaries on solid walls the velocity is set to zero whereas no condition on the pressure is required at the inflow boundary velocity is set to the undisturbed flow value and the pressure is extrapolated from inside on the contrary the pressure is set to zero at the downstream boundary whereas velocity is extrapolated from inner points to ensure negligible effects on the solution in the region of interest the inflow and outflow sections are placed far enough the initial conditions are specified for the velocity the numerical solution of the system of equation 1 is computed by the xnavis code which is a general purpose second order finite volume multi block unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations uranse based solver developed at cnr insean national research council marine technology research institute a brief description of this numerical tool is given here the interested reader can refer to the work of di mascio et al 2006 di mascio et al 2007 and di mascio et al 2009 a numerical approximation for the solution of equation 2 is obtained by partitioning the fluid domain d into n l structured blocks d l each subdivided into n i xn j xn k disjoint hexahedrons in the numerical scheme adopted here the blocks are not necessarily disjoint but can be partially overlapped conservation laws are then applied to each finite volume s 1 6 s s u n d s 0 t v i j k u d v s 1 6 s s f c f d n d s 0 where s s is the s th face of the finite volume v ijk n is the outward normal and the fluxes are decomposed into a convective part fc and a diffusive term fd as defined in equation 2 the computation of the convective fluxes and the surface integral of the velocity in the continuity equation can be done by several approximation schemes available in the code ranging from the first order godunov scheme the second order total variation diminishing tvd scheme the third order essentially non oscillatory eno scheme the third order weighted eno weno scheme and the classical fourth order centered scheme for more details see di mascio et al 2009 viscous fluxes are discretized by means of the classical finite volumes second order formulation the free surface effects are simulated through a fully non linear level set single phase methodology di mascio et al 2007 in order to have a fully implicit scheme and to obtain a divergence free velocity field a dual or pseudo time derivative is introduced in the discrete system of equations and the solution is iterated to steady state with respect to the pseudo time the full multi grid approach and the implicit approximate factorization technique with local time stepping are used to speed up convergence of the internal iteration the full multi grid approach is also exploited to assess grid sensitivity the richardson s extrapolation technique is used to evaluate numerical uncertainty roache 1997 by the comparison of the solution on each grid refinement level the numerical mesh employed is based on chimera grid technique in this approach the possibility to let the grids overlap is achieved through a modification of both the boundary conditions and internal point treatment for those zones where overlapping appears dynamic overlapping grids method allows for easy and accurate handling of complex geometries and multiple bodies in relative motion chimera technique requires to locate regions in other blocks from where an approximation of the solution can be extracted namely it requires to find donor cells once the donor is identified a convex set of eight donor cell centers is searched and a tri linear interpolation is used to transfer the solution from one block to the one under analysis if an overlapped cell is found the cell is marked as a hole only if the donor cell is smaller more refined than the one under analysis differently from standard chimera approaches however the cell marked as holes are not removed from the computation instead the interpolated solution is enforced on the marked cell point by adding a forcing term to the navier stokes equations in a body force fashion for more details see di mascio et al 2006 high performance computing capabilities are achieved by an efficient shared and distributed memory parallelization broglia et al 2014 the code has been widely applied for several naval hydrodynamics related problems for example maneuverability of surface vessels and submarines naval propellers and hydrodynamics of multihull vessels broglia et al 2015 dubbioso et al 2017 muscari et al 2013 zaghi et al 2011 2 2 shyfem model the steady state hydrodynamic fields produced by cfd modeling define the shape and characteristics of the ship induced wave to properly reproduce the propagation of the depression wave through the channel and the tidal flats a new version of the finite element hydrodynamic model shyfem umgiesser et al 2004 bellafiore and umgiesser 2010 was developed the model was applied to many transitional environments and coastal systems bellafiore and umgiesser 2010 umgiesser et al 2014 de pascalis et al 2011 ferrarin et al 2008 2010 ghezzo et al 2010 the model solves shallow water equations vertically integrated over each layer velocities are computed in the center of each element whereas the water level is computed on the grid nodes vertically the model can describe the layers through z or sigma layers horizontal velocities are computed in the center of each layer while the stress and the vertical velocity are computed at the interface between layers the horizontal viscosity is parameterized by means of the smagorinsky formulation smagorinsky 1963 blumberg and mellor 1987 while the vertical viscosity is computed through a k ε turbulence closure module an adaptation of the gotm general ocean turbulence model one described in burchard and petersen 1999 the model adopts a semi implicit scheme for the temporal discretization horizontal diffusion and baroclinic pressure gradients in the momentum equations are treated explicitly the coriolis force and the barotropic pressure gradient in the momentum equations and the divergence term in the continuity equation are treated semi implicitly the vertical stresses and the bottom friction are computed implicitly to ensure stability the spatial discretization follows the galerkin method a variation of the classical formulation adopted for finite elements to avoid numerical damping and to assure mass conservation umgiesser et al 2004 2 3 model coupling we developed a new algorithm specifically for this implementation to impose to shyfem the hydrodynamic forcing provided by xnavis in terms of water levels computed from provided surface pressure and 3d velocity at each time step output fields from xnavis are geo localized in a progressive point of the given ship trajectory within the domain as it is sketched in fig 2 the water levels are interpolated and fixed in an elliptical area with minor across channel and major along channel axes smaller than the cfd matrix dimension and centered on the ship mid point this specific sub area is therefore treated as a boundary area where to force the system with water levels in the transient area between the described ellipse and the major ellipse inscribed in the cfd matrix water level values are nudged relaxation time time step this choice allows keeping the original water level pattern fixed in the area close to the ship hull permitting a progressive relaxation to the shyfem shallow water equations solution at the borders of the cfd matrix area accordingly to ensure the correct provision of cfd matrix forcing stability and the mass conservation in shyfem the 3d velocity field is directly imposed in the whole area covered by the cylinder with basis equal to the major ellipse inscribed in the cfd matrix 3 the venice experiment scientific literature describes several natural and artificial environments that experience an increasing impact due to navigation like the elbe estuary silinski et al 2015 the kiel canal uliczka and kondziella 2016 the hudson bay zheng et al 2016 the mississippi river system sorensen 1997 and many more the venice lagoon and its major waterway the malamocco marghera industrial channel hereinafter mm channel represent a paramount example of highly anthropized transitional environments sarretta et al 2010 therefore a joint effort based on two field campaigns the former investigating the passage of cruise ships the latter typical commercial ships and modeling was performed on the mm channel regardless of the peculiar characteristics of this study site there are substantial analogies with processes and impacts observed in other locations worldwide 3 1 study site description the venice lagoon 50 km long 10 km wide one of the largest mediterranean transitional environment was heavily modified in the last century in the early 1900 just after the stabilization of the three inlets with jetties an industrial district the porto marghera industrial zone was built at the western border of its central basin initially routed across the historic center of the city commercial ship traffic was successively redirected in the mm channel which was created on purpose in the late 60s to connect the industrial port to the sea through the malamocco inlet fig 3 the channel has a straight branch 200 m wide and 17 m deep along the east west direction that connects the inlet to the inner border of the lagoon it then narrows along the south north direction to a 120 m wide 12 m deep channel that reaches the port facilities the channel bed is 100 m and 60 m wide for the two segments respectively and its cross section is trapezoidal on its entire path after the excavation of the channel the proximal tidal flats of the central lagoon underwent a progressive generalized erosion molinaroli et al 2009 sarretta et al 2010 d alpaos 2010 a recent monitoring of sediment exchanges through time evidenced that material eroded from the central lagoon is not completely flushed away from the lagoon defendi et al 2010 but seems to be mainly deposited in the channels this trend would determine a general and progressive reduction of morphological feature diversity and loss of habitats in these specific areas sarretta et al 2010 zaggia et al 2017 in fact the port traffic progressively increased in terms of number of passengers and of number and dimension of cargos exposing such a morphodynamically active and peculiar transitional environment to additional stresses 3 2 field experiments ad hoc experimental activities were carried out to investigate ship induced currents and ship wave propagation over the tidal flats in the venice lagoon two field surveys were conducted on 18th 19th of july 2015 when large cruise ships reached the passenger terminal located in the historical center of venice passing through the mm channel on 29th 31st of march 2016 when additional instruments were deployed on the tidal flat bordering the mm channel commercial ships were monitored during this survey the field activity of the 18 19th of july 2015 was conducted on a portion of the mm channel 12 m deep and 150 m large bordered at west by an area that was reclaimed in the 60 for the expansion of the nearby industrial district of porto marghera and by an extended tidal flat to the east on this side of the channel the mudflat is protected by a breakwater structure located at a distance of about 100 m from the channel fig 4 an electromagnetic current meter interocean systems s4 recording at a frequency of 2 hz was deployed near bottom at 30 m east from the channel main axis station s2 fig 4 providing current velocity and direction pressure then converted in corresponding water level values and turbidity data a multi parametric probe idronaut ocean seven 304 ctd t equipped with pressure sensors working at 8 hz was deployed at the nearby tidal flat at about 100 m from the channel edge station b2 fig 4 the first field campaign was performed in spring tide conditions with maximum vertical water level excursion of 90 cm all ship passages were in temporal correspondence of the minimum value of tide low tide the second field activity on the 29th 31st of march 2016 was planned for the investigation on the tidal flat the instrumental setup was designed to give an accurate indication on the ship wave propagation even at large distance from the channel up to 1650 m fig 4 each station of the mudflat b2 b8 fig 4 was equipped with a pressure sensor with data logger rbr richard brancker researche instruments solo working at a sampling frequency of 16 hz at stations b2 and b4 two electromagnetic current meters interocean systems s4 were deployed sampling at frequencies of 2 hz and 5 hz respectively the relatively high sampling frequency was chosen to allow a fair description of the wave features over the innermost part of the tidal flat where the shape of the wave undergoes a strong modification of its front that introduces short period oscillations moreover the 2 hz frequency of the current meter in b2 is considered suitable for the description of the typical depression waves observed in the area rapaglia et al 2011 fig 4 shows also the cross sectional bathymetric profile acquired during the second field campaign ship passages were determined from the website https www marinetraffic com the provided information was on the ship passage time and speed while no data on ship tracks were available 3 3 model chain application the physical process that is studied is strongly influenced by the relative dimensions of the ship and the geometry of the channel thus given a channel geometry the principal parameters are the block coefficient and the draft the block coefficient is defined as the ratio between the displaced volume and the value of the product of the length the width and the draught of the ship c b l pp xb wl xt complete information about the shape of cruise ships in the venice lagoon was not available therefore to study a more realistic scenario the cfd simulations were conducted stretching the dimensions of a basic ship shape a japanese bulk carrier jbc mono propeller c b 0 85 for which the geometry was available the re shaping procedure has been pursued keeping fixed the value of the block coefficient to 0 7 typical of the cruise ships entering the venice lagoon as deduced from rapaglia et al 2011 and rapaglia et al 2015 which is considered as the main parameter affecting the physical model the limit of the adopted procedure is that bow and stern s phase could be somehow different from a typical cruise ship anyway this aspect provides larger effect on the generated wave pattern close to the ship and minor effects on the far field pattern moreover although bulk carriers can sometimes have large drafts up to 10 m the typical draft of cargo ships is comparable to cruise ships drafts monitored in the venice lagoon around 8 5 m two re shapings where considered and the principal dimensions of the two simulated ships are reported in table 1 ship1 was just stretched partially re shaped and linearly rescaled in order to reduce the jbc block coefficient to 0 7 from that keeping c b ship2 was re shaped to meet the dimensions of cruise ship costa deliziosa as much as possible for validation purposes the two re shapings represent the typologies of cruise ships sailing through the venice lagoon allowed inferences to be made on the impact of different draughts on the wave propagation simulations with xnavis were conducted in a rectilinear channel with a constant cross section corresponding to the geometry of the mm channel close to the investigated area fig 5 where the experimental measurements were performed in the simulations the channel was considered left right symmetric with the longitudinal axis of the ship corresponding to the channel axis therefore the numerical domain reproduced is one half of the channel the discretization of the fluid dynamical field around the ship is obtained exploiting the overlapping grids capabilities of the solver fig 5 left in particular two zones were considered one in the proximity of the ship hull and the other one covering the entire channel for the region close to the hull several structured overlapped and adjacent blocks body fitted on the surface of the hull are used the specific resolution is driven by geometrical consideration higher resolution in region of higher curvature and by fluid dynamics considerations higher resolution where larger gradients of the field variables are expected in particular the cells are only slightly clustered toward solid wall surfaces the simulation being inviscid in fact viscous forces have negligible effects on the wave pattern the domain of interest being small if compared with the major wavelength generating from the ship thus no relevant viscous dispersion happens the grid covers an area up to 660 m upstream and downstream the ship and 200 m laterally to accurately consider all the effects from the boundaries and the variation of the cross section of the channel a very fine discretization has been made ranging from 0 1 m to a few meters this accounts for about 22 millions of finite volumes used for the discretization of the channel and a total of 24 5 millions of volume for the whole cfd mesh we did not account for the effects produced by propellers as it is reasonable to consider them negligible for the propagation of the depression wave the air water interface was treated with a single level set technique which guarantees a fully non linear treatment of the free surface including its deformation to accurately describe the wave system a very refined grid resolution in the free surface region has been considered indeed the numerical tests performed with a fixed surface and linearized boundary conditions have shown less accuracy in the results and an underestimation of the ship wave amplitude the flow field is resolved in the ship reference system and velocity is considered stationary in fig 5 right the pressure field on the hull surface and on the bottom wall is reported as an example of cfd solution high pressure regions are seen close to the bow and the stern of the ship i e at the stagnation points whereas a rather large flat low pressure region is predicted along the side of the vessel it is interesting to note the deep depression that develops close to the stern region this is clearly a consequence of the acceleration of the flow beneath of the vessel due to the bernoulli effects the strong depression region is typical during the navigation in very shallow water and the consequent squat can cause ship grounding the 3d hydrodynamic outputs of xnavis interpolated on a cartesian block centered around the hull having resolution of 0 7 m 0 7 m 0 4 m in the x y z directions are used as forcing for the shyfem simulations the numerical mesh of shyfem describes with 26037 nodes and 51638 triangular elements resolution ranging from 3 m to 40 m see example of the mesh in fig 2 a portion of the venice lagoon adjacent to the mm channel fig 3 purple square the computational domain was chosen to represent the area covered by the field measurements the bathymetry is based on the dataset collected by magistrato alle acque di venezia mav in 2002 and merged with following surveys and on data measured by ismar cnr in 2014 in the main channels of the venice lagoon comparing the cross sectional bathymetric profile acquired during the second field campaign with the one obtained from this dataset some discrepancies arise the current tidal flats are slightly deeper about 30 cm and the channel slightly shallower 30 cm compared to the depth resulting from measurements of mav in 2002 the shyfem simulations run imposing 12 vertical sigma layers to reach at most a maximum thickness of 1 m in the mm channel and higher vertical resolution in shallower areas of the domain the coriolis effects are not considered due to the limited area of the domain tvd total variation diminishing schemes are used for horizontal and vertical advection the numerical experiments were performed evaluating a first ship ship1 in table 1 sailing at two different speeds 8 6 kn and 7 7 kn and a second ship ship 2 in table 1 sailing at 8 6 kn the three experiments were planned to validate the setup investigating the effect of a different ship geometry particularly the effect of draught at a given speed ship1 1 and ship2 1 table 2 and to state the variation in the wave signal just due to reduced velocities ship1 1 and ship1 2 table 2 for the specific channel simulated the mean water level was set to 23 cm to account for the tidal condition at the time of the observations 4 results and discussion 4 1 depression wave characterization and model validation the waves created by cruise ship passages were monitored in the investigated section during the field measurement of july 18 19th 2015 stations s2 in the channel and b2 in the tidal flats the sea surface elevation measured during the passage of the ship costa deliziosa the 19th of july 2015 at 4 28 utc in the mm channel directed to the cruise terminal is used to validate the model chain results fig 6 shows the comparison between the depression waves and currents taken during the passage of the ship costa deliziosa and the model chain results in correspondence of stations s2 in the channel and b2 in the nearby tidal flat as it was seen in previous works rapaglia et al 2011 parnell et al 2015 the depression wave developed in the channel is characterized by a deep trough with an almost symmetrical shape around the minimum level high frequency oscillations are registered before the maximum depression zmax in fig 1 and after the passage of the ship the former is probably due to local effects induced by the hull while the latter results from the interference of the primary depression wave with the secondary waves during the restoration of the pressure field in still conditions once the depression wave reaches the tidal flat position b2 the value of zmax is attenuated by the interaction with the bottom and the wave shape changes to the well documented asymmetric v shape fig 6 parnell et al 2015 the water level decreased at s2 of about 70 cm with respect to the still condition while on the tidal flat zmax was approximately 50 cm the instrument placed on the channel bottom recorded no clear evidence of an increase of the sea level at the beginning of the disturbance the ship1 1 simulation shows a maximum depression of 94 cm which overestimates the observation 71 cm the difference could partially be explained by a larger immersed surface of the hull corresponding to a draught of 8 7 m instead of the draught of the real case 8 0 m to verify this hypothesis and better understand the origin of the discrepancy we also considered the results from ship2 1 simulation which considers a smaller draught than ship1 1 simulation i e comparable with the one of the measured ship the results of this second run are in better agreement with the observations in s2 even if underestimating the measured value of about 10 cm a similar discrepancy is found at station b2 the computed waves for both simulated ships differ from measurements in reproducing the positive peak about 20 cm registered both in the channel and in the tidal flat before the depression analyzing the steady state field produced by xnavis we found that the model seems to enhance the peak due to the pressure effect at the bow and at the stern this discrepancy could probably be due to the numerical assumptions non viscous flow absence of the propeller additionally the simulated geometry being a re scaling of a bulk carrier type is different from the real ship and this aspect can influence the wave pattern producing lower local attenuation of the signal however due to the local nature of these processes characterized by wave lengths lower than the principal wave signal their influence is negligible on the wave propagation over the tidal flat the ship wave reproduced by the modeling chain reaches the tidal flat position b2 14 8 s earlier than the measurements probably the approximations applied for the shyfem set up as the hydrostatic approximation that inhibits the vertical acceleration and the shallow water approximation of equations can be responsible for the observed time shift however the time shift results smaller than the value obtained with other numerical approaches as for example the one proposed by parnell et al 2015 where the signal simulated by the 1d non linear model is slower and shows a delay of 40 s from measurements modeled bottom velocities were also assessed against measurements during the ship passage the measured current speed on the mm channel bottom was predominantly directed along the channel main axis negative values in fig 6 with a southward component of 120 cm s 1 three times larger than the westward component the measured signal in s2 shows a tidal current directed northward before the passage of the ship along the channel main axis during the ship passage first there is an increase in the current toward east followed by an opposite current the maximum value of current is higher than 1 m s 1 directed to south west we note not shown here that the disturbance induced by the ship lasted for about 15 min after the passage on both the channel and the tidal flat all simulations show a similar pattern of currents generated by the ship passage both in direction and speed the simulations do not consider the tide as forcing and this can justify the small discrepancies with the observations to interpret the noted discrepancies at least in the depression wave amplitude between measured and modeled results a theoretical model evaluating the energy balance of the process was applied following the approach proposed by schijf pianc 1987 it is possible to define a maximum ship speed suitable for navigation in restricted channels vl by solving the following implicit equation 3 v l g h 2 3 1 5 1 a m a c v l 2 2 g h 1 5 where h a c b w a m is the wetted area of ship at mid length a c is the wetted area of cross channel section b w is the width of the channel at the surface and b b is the width of the channel at the bottom fig 1 the mean water level depression d h can be computed solving the system 4 d h v s 2 2 g α 1 a c a w 2 1 a w b b h d h m h d h 2 a m where v s is the ship speed a w is the wetted cross sectional area at the ship passage h is the still water level m is the slope of the channel bank 1 1 4 0 4 v s v l the theoretical model was assessed against the results of measurements performed during the 18 19th of july 2015 campaign which have blockage ratio a m a c i e the ratio of the immersed ship area a m to channel cross sectional area a c fig 1 ranging from 0 13 to 0 16 and variable speed from 7 4 kn to 9 0 kn the full list of considered ships with their geometric characteristics speed and the measured zmax in s2 and b2 is reported in appendix the monitored ships generally navigate at higher speed while leaving the lagoon thus the corresponding zmax are larger compared to ships with same blockage ratios i e msc poesia msc magnifica and msc musica see appendix primarily it should be mentioned that the channel cross section has a different shape before and after the monitoring stations and consequently ships move through portions of channel that have different confinement blockage ratio additionally the route of the ships does not always follow the central axis of the channel therefore observed effects could differ from those expected despite the lack of information from the available measurements these aspects were analyzed in literature and studies can be mentioned that address it wang and zou 2014 lataire and vantorre 2008 and references therein entering a part of the channel with higher confinement lock increases the velocity of return flow with sudden changes in the hydrodynamics in the portion of channel where there is the highest change in the section meng et al 2015 moreover the presence of banks gives rise to interaction processes with the ship and if the ship is sailing closest to one of the channel sides eccentricity this would lead to asymmetries also in the lateral wave generation the lateral depression would be more pronounced and there could occur an attractive force that move the ship close to the bank lataire and vantorre 2008 therefore we should take into account the possible effects of bank effects shape distance slope and sailing trajectory possible eccentricity on the amplitude of the depression wave following the schijf formulation measured and theoretically expected depression wave amplitude are shown in fig 7 the maximum depression measured in s2 cannot be properly defined as zmax because the monitoring station does not correspond to the center of the channel and ship eccentricity is not known therefore the comparison is made between the measured maximum depression values and theoretical dh it has to be noted that some ships travelled with a speed exceeding the critical ship speed and therefore did not properly fulfill the assumptions of the approximate energy approach nevertheless the comparison shows agreement between measured and theoretical results with a mean absolute difference of about 12 cm which we assume acceptable within the adopted approximations indeed the channel section used for the computation has been approximated with a trapezoidal shape and the ship passages entering and exiting the channel were similarly treated even if the channel section changes before and after the monitored zone moreover there is no information about the eccentricity of the ship trajectory respect to the longitudinal axis of the channel a similar analysis using eccentricity of 15 m would increase the mean absolute difference of 3 cm all these aspects can justify the discrepancies between the theoretical computation and the measurements however the theoretical model allows quantifying the expected zmax induced by the ships confirming the correlation with ship speed and geometry blockage ratio by computing the mean depression wave with the schijf model for the cruise ship costa deliziosa passage taking into account the modeled geometries and speeds of ship1 and ship2 a zmax decrease of 15 cm due to the smaller area of the immersed section of the latter ship is expected that could finally explain the discrepancy seen in fig 6 the dissipation of potential energy between the channel center s2 and the tidal flat b2 is evaluated in fig 8 as the difference between zmax at the two locations for all the cruise ships that were measured in the 18 19th of july campaign in general the larger the disturbance in the channel and thus the current speed induced by the drawdown the larger the dissipation along the course between the two stations indeed the maximum difference of about 35 cm is associated with the shallower depression in the channel resulting in more than 90 cm in percentage the differences respect to the amplitude in the center of the channel range between 20 and 36 looking at fig 8 it can be noted that the model results are in reasonable agreement with measurements probably matching the dissipation processes that would justify the observed increase in the attenuation rate respect to the wave amplitude in the channel however there is a small overestimation 5 in modeled attenuation rates which could be ascribed to differences in the bathymetry imposed to the model the excess of modeled dissipation can be due to the above mentioned small discrepancy between the used and the real bathymetry with a shallower tidal flat close to the channel compared with the actual situation enhancing the effects of bottom stress 4 2 assessment of shipwave propagation on the tidal flats depression waves created by the traffic of commercial vessels container ships bulk carriers and tankers were acquired during the field measurements of the 29th 31st of march 2016 we monitored 40 ships navigating in the channel but only a sample of 16 vessels was used for the analysis after a quality check on the recorded data the observed and modeled depressions over the tidal flat stations are shown in fig 9 the seven stations shown b2 b8 fig 4 are located in a tidal flat zone that progressively varies from a depth of 1 9 b2 to 0 9 m b5 b6 and then to 1 5 m b7 b8 hence we expected most of the dissipation occurring within approximately the first kilometer from the channel axis the depression waves have a mean value of 33 cm in b2 where however values have a wide range 36 cm that depends on the different geometry and speed of the monitored ships the depression wave is progressively attenuated toward the center of the tidal flat passing from a mean value of 9 cm with a range of 8 cm at station b6 to a mean value of 6 cm at station b8 with a range of 6 cm this suggests that as expected the most dissipative region of the tidal flat is between b2 and b6 which corresponds to the zone with the largest gradient in water depth the deepest depressions in b2 are the ones that are damped the most in the propagation over this part of the tidal flat all the described features are evident in fig 10 where the wave attenuation over the tidal flat stations is defined as a percentage of the value in station b2 considering the average trend station b6 registers an attenuation of about 73 while in station b8 the attenuation is about 80 of the initial b2 value as an average this confirms that stations b2 and b6 where depth is decreasing progressively bound the area characterized by the maximum attenuation rate in b8 the minimum and maximum attenuations correspond to 68 and 91 fig 10 showing that a considerable range of attenuations occurs fig 10 also shows how over the tidal flats the modeled depression waves are generally larger than those measured in b2 in particular ship1 1 simulation at 8 6 kn speed in fact this run considers ship parameters that lead to a higher blockage ratio and ship speed compared to the ones in the measured dataset in any case the model dissipation reproduces fairly well the observed trend within station b2 and b5 where depth is progressively decreasing model outputs show that in the most distant stations from the channel center the signal is completely attenuated the modeling chain allows inferring about some specific dependency relations not always so easy to verify from measurements because of the variety of concurrent factors as the response of the system to varying speeds with a fixed geometry or to different ships traveling at the same speed in fig 11 the attenuation rate for the two simulations ship1 1 and ship1 2 is shown it is evident how the increase in ship speed enhances the amplitude of the depression and the attenuation rate the deepest the depression in the center of the channel the largest its interaction with the tidal flat dynamics by bottom stress effects and dissipation with consequences on the morphology of the channel tidal flat system on the other hand considering ship1 1 and ship2 1 simulations it is evident that the ship with the smaller draft propagated a smaller depression wave 61 cm vs 95 cm another important aspect that is evidenced by fig 11 is that ships with smaller draught but higher speeds ship2 1 simulation 8 6 kn produced a slightly smaller depression compared to bigger ships traveling at lower speeds ship1 2 simulation 7 7 kn in order to complete the analysis of the three simulation results we evaluate the distributions of maximum depression and normalized maximum depression referred to the residual water level fig 12 what can be deduced is that for all simulations for the test velocities the area characterized by maximum depressions deeper than 10 cm reaches the tidal flat identifying a possible area of influence due to the ship passage within station b4 this aspect is in good agreement with the results of measurements comparing ship 1 1 and ship 1 2 the increase in speed does not change significantly the area of influence but the maximum depressions are larger particularly in the tidal flat close to the channel normalized maximum depression 0 4 vs 0 5 if we consider the passage of different ships at the same velocity ship 1 1 and ship 2 1 an enlargement of the area of influence for the ship with the bigger draft is found also the absolute maximum depressions are bigger therefore it can be concluded that the passage of a ship with bigger dimensions deeper draft but lower speed influences a larger area of the tidal flat than a ship with smaller dimensions and higher speed 5 conclusions and perspectives ship wakes formation and propagation in confined channels is a topic tackled by several scientists and engineers dealing with theoretical issues and impacts on coastal environments this research work tests a numerical methodology that keeps the required degree of physical complexity and provides outcomes of primary importance for environmental protection and easily applicable for management the tool allows for the investigation of the hydrodynamics in a waterway around the ship hull through a cfd solver and propagation of the pressure perturbation in the surrounding shallow areas through a shallow water unstructured model the novelty of the proposed approach is the combined implementation of different numerical tools able to provide an accurate description of both the local and far field processes this approach could eventually include local effects related to the viscosity and the presence of propellers considering highly detailed ship geometries although some approximations were introduced in the proposed approach the numerical model chain has been successfully validated against observations of water levels and currents collected in the venice lagoon the modeling tool complements the information from the field activities and previous works investigating the what if option connected with different ship sizes or navigation speed these are two factors influencing the shape and propagation of lateral wave level depression among a number of other ones which can be better analyzed when data for comparison are available such as the channel geometry width depth bank slope and the real ship track eccentricity the first test evidenced how the ship geometry plays a fundamental role in producing ship wakes that can be still visible at a large distance from the navigation channel over the tidal flat for the considered ship speed range still higher than the existing speed limits for navigation in the channel but consistent with the velocities measured during ship transits in our field experiments smaller and faster ships seem to have less impact on the tidal flat than bigger vessels navigating at relatively lower speeds further sensitivity analyses can provide a full range of options within the maximum minimum speed limits that guarantee ship maneuverability which could easily be considered in specific decision support systems dss this analysis suggests that the developed tools could be further refined to introduce other hydrodynamic drivers like atmospheric forcing and tides needed to match the complexity of the real case moreover the numerical models could be also used to investigate the effect of ship waves on sediment resuspension and morphodynamics of complex coastal systems

23493,as the size of vessels progressively increases to compete in the global trade the impact evaluation of navigation in waterways and shallow coastal ecosystems become more important therefore suitable tools to investigate processes are required to support a sustainable management of ship traffic this work tests a new methodology based on a numerical model chain that reproduces the hydrodynamic field close to the ship hull and the ship induced wave propagation in the surrounding shallow areas the model chain includes an unstructured hydrodynamic model forced by the near field estimation of a computational fluid dynamics simulation the modeling system has been applied to a major navigation channel and surrounding tidal flats in the venice lagoon italy field observations and a theoretical framework were used to characterize the ship waves and to validate the modeling system results show that the deeper the initial depression the larger the dissipation over the tidal flat in these conditions smaller vessels sailing at higher speed produce smaller waves with low amplitudes compared to larger ships traveling at lower speed we considered vessels moving at different speeds providing useful information to evaluate impacts and to define criteria for decision support systems for a sustainable management of navigation keywords ship waves cfd hydrodynamic model tidal flats venice lagoon 1 introduction shipping is undoubtedly the most efficient way of transporting goods worldwide however there are mounting concerns about the impacts of the global traffic on the marine environment both off shore and on shore zheng et al 2016 besides pollution and underwater noise ship traffic in coastal areas can represent one of the major inputs of energy in form of disturbance of the hydrodynamic field which can become a dominant forcing for the morphodynamics of sheltered areas soomere 2005 moreover waterways are conveniently located in transitional systems like estuaries and lagoons providing a safe access to ports and serving as hubs for inland cities and their industrial and commercial districts navigable channels in transitional areas are often the combined result of the anthropic modifications and natural adaptation of the existing morphology to the stress of traffic and they frequently require dredging interventions dai et al 2013 rosati et al 2011 the progressive increase in vessel size rodrigue 2013 is a threat for such complex and delicate environments as large ships moving in channels confined by tidal flats and marshlands or simply wetlands can considerably affect the local morphodynamics rapaglia et al 2011 2015 these issues are of fundamental importance to define criteria for the sustainable management of the ecosystem and minimize the impacts of navigation critical aspects of monitoring and modeling ship waves in shallow water coastal systems are linked with the intrinsic complexity of the process and the variety of morphological features like natural and artificial channels tidal flats and salt marshes when a vessel is moving in a confined channel the wave pattern produced is the result of the interaction between the hydrodynamic field in the proximity of the hull and the geometry of the channel and its margins when those are constituted by shallow water areas three main factors affect the variation of water level the speed of the ship the geometry of the hull and the channel cross section sorensen 1997 the flow field close to the hull is characterized by a pressure increase at the bow and the stern of the hull whereas the sides experience a rather flat low pressure region in the navigation channel the hydrodynamics is characterized by backward return currents parallel and opposite to the ship course a lateral water level depression here called depression wave according to rapaglia et al 2011 rodin et al 2015 and parnell et al 2015 and a front wave with positive peaks at bow and stern fig 1 these perturbations represent the so called primary waves the depression wave follows the ship during its transit along the waterway and has a major component of propagation perpendicularly to the channel main axis the perturbation approaches the channel sides interacting with the morphology shoaling and affects the adjacent tidal flats determining large sediment resuspension gelinas et al 2013 and morphological changes the far field waves in deep water can be classified as transverse and divergent waves fig 1a divergent waves as free surface inertial waves originate at the bow and stern or wherever the ship hull does not show a continuous surface they propagate in shallow waters with an angle from the ship longitudinal axis depending on the ship speed and the water depth in the channel these waves can combine and produce interferences with visible peaks their amplitude increases with the ship speed and can locally deepen the depression wave primary waves pianc 1987 for an advancing ship in straight course at constant speed the resulting wave system translates with the ship itself the included half angle of the wave pattern is called the kelvin angle for a ship advancing in deep water this angle is fixed and it is equal to 19 28 for a ship advancing in finite depth sea the kelvin angle depends on the water depth and the ship speed the depth based froude number f r h v g h where v is the ship speed g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the water depth newman 1977 can help in distinguishing the different waves propagating from the hull in shallow channels like the considered one the limited navigation speed leads to fr h 1 in these conditions the most significant perturbation is connected to the lateral depression waves while kelvin waves usually generated in deep waters are negligible rapaglia et al 2011 these asymmetric non linear v shaped depression waves propagate on the shallows rodin et al 2015 parnell et al 2015 as far as the modeling is concerned previous studies address the investigation of ship hydrodynamics from different perspectives and with different aims most of the works are focused on the near field analysis i e a region around the vessels of the order of one ship length applications considering vessels operating in open sea as for example visonneau et al 2016 carrica et al 2016 broglia et al 2015 dubbioso et al 2017 and hirdaris et al 2016 interacting with the surrounding background field e g mousaviraad et al 2015 volpi et al 2016 carrica et al 2008 shibata et al 2012 and advancing in confined channels e g rodin et al 2015 eloot and vantorre 2011 dam et al 2008 fleit et al 2016 torsvik et al 2009 can be mentioned both experimental fluid dynamics efd tests and computational fluid dynamics cfd models are commonly used for an overview of the state of the art on this topic the interested reader can refer to the latest workshops on marine hydrodynamics and related topics salvatore et al 2015 larsson et al 2013 simonsen et al 2014 these studies are mainly focused on local small scale interaction between the hull and the surrounding water and rarely does the investigation involve far field hydrodynamics the main advantage of these models is the high resolution and the capability to reproduce small scale and turbulent processes close to the hull as well as wave pattern providing a useful indication for ship maneuverability sea keeping and in general naval hydrodynamics related problems navigation in confined water either shallow or restricted waterways and hydrodynamic interactions due to the passage of multiple ships are also interesting research topics different numerical approaches are commonly used ranging from the boussinesq 2d models e g nascimento et al 2011 dam et al 2008 to 3d models e g yuan et al 2016 yao and dong 2016 and cfd based tools e g mousaviraad et al 2016a as well as combined efd studies and cfd implementations e g eloot and vantorre 2011 fleit et al 2016 mousaviraad et al 2016b however due to the high computational resources required cfd tools cannot be deemed as the most suitable and efficient approach for the investigation of the propagation of the ship generated waves in the far field rather the use of simplified models has to be considered the existing literature provides several examples of these models which consider the channel borders investigating the effects of the ship passage on the surrounding shallow areas generally adopting idealized and synthetically produced characteristic wave crest e g torsvik et al 2009 dam et al 2008 rodrigues et al 2015 modeling applications that studied the propagation of the wave through linear weakly non linear or highly non linear wave theories can be mentioned some implementations have recently been performed along a channel section giving a 1d description of processes rodin et al 2015 parnell et al 2015 therefore the contribution on the 2d field of different areas of the ship was not considered not reproducing the background field interactions and approximating the vertical effects of bottom structures these assumptions could lead to small inconsistencies in comparison with measured data like time shifts due to oblique wave interferences therefore by examining the existing literature a double need arises to properly reproduce the wave pattern around the hull specifically the depression wave in its 2d pattern and to evaluate its propagation outside the channel borders this work presents a multi model tool suitable for simulating ship induced waves in shallow water systems the proposed approach considers a high fidelity unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations model to accurately describe the flow field inside the channel in the proximity of the vessel coupled with a finite element hydrodynamic model that reproduces the depression wave propagation in the surrounding shallow water area the model chain has been applied to the venice lagoon and validated against observations acquired in its major waterway and the surrounding tidal flats 2 methods the modeling chain the numerical model chain used to investigate the hydrodynamic effects determined by the passage of ships in a channel surrounded by tidal flats is composed of a cfd solver xnavis that provides steady state velocity and water level fields in a limited area around the ship hull within the channel and a 3d hydrodynamic finite element model shyfem forced by the cfd field along a moving trajectory 2 1 xnavis model the hydrodynamic field that originates around the ship hull advancing straight ahead in a rectilinear channel is computed by the numerical solution of the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations which can be written in integral form as 1 s v u n d s 0 t v u d v s v f c f d n d s 0 where v is the control volume s v its boundary and n the vector normal to s v directed outside the volume the equations are written in an inertial reference system and are made non dimensional through a reference velocity the free stream velocity u 0 a reference length the ship length lpp and the water density ρ 1026 021 kg m3 in the following results will be discussed in the dimensional form fc and fd represent the non viscous advection and pressure contribution and viscous fluxes respectively 2 f c p i u u f d 1 r e ν t u u t where p is a new variable related to the pressure p and the acceleration of gravity g parallel to the vertical axis z by p p z fr2 fr u 0 g lpp 1 2 being the froude number re u 0 lpp ν is the reynolds number ν is the kinematic viscosity ν 1 189 10 6m2 s ν t is the non dimensional turbulent viscosity that can be computed by means of several turbulence models implemented in the solver mathematically the system of equation 1 must be completed by appropriate conditions at physical and computational boundaries on solid walls the velocity is set to zero whereas no condition on the pressure is required at the inflow boundary velocity is set to the undisturbed flow value and the pressure is extrapolated from inside on the contrary the pressure is set to zero at the downstream boundary whereas velocity is extrapolated from inner points to ensure negligible effects on the solution in the region of interest the inflow and outflow sections are placed far enough the initial conditions are specified for the velocity the numerical solution of the system of equation 1 is computed by the xnavis code which is a general purpose second order finite volume multi block unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations uranse based solver developed at cnr insean national research council marine technology research institute a brief description of this numerical tool is given here the interested reader can refer to the work of di mascio et al 2006 di mascio et al 2007 and di mascio et al 2009 a numerical approximation for the solution of equation 2 is obtained by partitioning the fluid domain d into n l structured blocks d l each subdivided into n i xn j xn k disjoint hexahedrons in the numerical scheme adopted here the blocks are not necessarily disjoint but can be partially overlapped conservation laws are then applied to each finite volume s 1 6 s s u n d s 0 t v i j k u d v s 1 6 s s f c f d n d s 0 where s s is the s th face of the finite volume v ijk n is the outward normal and the fluxes are decomposed into a convective part fc and a diffusive term fd as defined in equation 2 the computation of the convective fluxes and the surface integral of the velocity in the continuity equation can be done by several approximation schemes available in the code ranging from the first order godunov scheme the second order total variation diminishing tvd scheme the third order essentially non oscillatory eno scheme the third order weighted eno weno scheme and the classical fourth order centered scheme for more details see di mascio et al 2009 viscous fluxes are discretized by means of the classical finite volumes second order formulation the free surface effects are simulated through a fully non linear level set single phase methodology di mascio et al 2007 in order to have a fully implicit scheme and to obtain a divergence free velocity field a dual or pseudo time derivative is introduced in the discrete system of equations and the solution is iterated to steady state with respect to the pseudo time the full multi grid approach and the implicit approximate factorization technique with local time stepping are used to speed up convergence of the internal iteration the full multi grid approach is also exploited to assess grid sensitivity the richardson s extrapolation technique is used to evaluate numerical uncertainty roache 1997 by the comparison of the solution on each grid refinement level the numerical mesh employed is based on chimera grid technique in this approach the possibility to let the grids overlap is achieved through a modification of both the boundary conditions and internal point treatment for those zones where overlapping appears dynamic overlapping grids method allows for easy and accurate handling of complex geometries and multiple bodies in relative motion chimera technique requires to locate regions in other blocks from where an approximation of the solution can be extracted namely it requires to find donor cells once the donor is identified a convex set of eight donor cell centers is searched and a tri linear interpolation is used to transfer the solution from one block to the one under analysis if an overlapped cell is found the cell is marked as a hole only if the donor cell is smaller more refined than the one under analysis differently from standard chimera approaches however the cell marked as holes are not removed from the computation instead the interpolated solution is enforced on the marked cell point by adding a forcing term to the navier stokes equations in a body force fashion for more details see di mascio et al 2006 high performance computing capabilities are achieved by an efficient shared and distributed memory parallelization broglia et al 2014 the code has been widely applied for several naval hydrodynamics related problems for example maneuverability of surface vessels and submarines naval propellers and hydrodynamics of multihull vessels broglia et al 2015 dubbioso et al 2017 muscari et al 2013 zaghi et al 2011 2 2 shyfem model the steady state hydrodynamic fields produced by cfd modeling define the shape and characteristics of the ship induced wave to properly reproduce the propagation of the depression wave through the channel and the tidal flats a new version of the finite element hydrodynamic model shyfem umgiesser et al 2004 bellafiore and umgiesser 2010 was developed the model was applied to many transitional environments and coastal systems bellafiore and umgiesser 2010 umgiesser et al 2014 de pascalis et al 2011 ferrarin et al 2008 2010 ghezzo et al 2010 the model solves shallow water equations vertically integrated over each layer velocities are computed in the center of each element whereas the water level is computed on the grid nodes vertically the model can describe the layers through z or sigma layers horizontal velocities are computed in the center of each layer while the stress and the vertical velocity are computed at the interface between layers the horizontal viscosity is parameterized by means of the smagorinsky formulation smagorinsky 1963 blumberg and mellor 1987 while the vertical viscosity is computed through a k ε turbulence closure module an adaptation of the gotm general ocean turbulence model one described in burchard and petersen 1999 the model adopts a semi implicit scheme for the temporal discretization horizontal diffusion and baroclinic pressure gradients in the momentum equations are treated explicitly the coriolis force and the barotropic pressure gradient in the momentum equations and the divergence term in the continuity equation are treated semi implicitly the vertical stresses and the bottom friction are computed implicitly to ensure stability the spatial discretization follows the galerkin method a variation of the classical formulation adopted for finite elements to avoid numerical damping and to assure mass conservation umgiesser et al 2004 2 3 model coupling we developed a new algorithm specifically for this implementation to impose to shyfem the hydrodynamic forcing provided by xnavis in terms of water levels computed from provided surface pressure and 3d velocity at each time step output fields from xnavis are geo localized in a progressive point of the given ship trajectory within the domain as it is sketched in fig 2 the water levels are interpolated and fixed in an elliptical area with minor across channel and major along channel axes smaller than the cfd matrix dimension and centered on the ship mid point this specific sub area is therefore treated as a boundary area where to force the system with water levels in the transient area between the described ellipse and the major ellipse inscribed in the cfd matrix water level values are nudged relaxation time time step this choice allows keeping the original water level pattern fixed in the area close to the ship hull permitting a progressive relaxation to the shyfem shallow water equations solution at the borders of the cfd matrix area accordingly to ensure the correct provision of cfd matrix forcing stability and the mass conservation in shyfem the 3d velocity field is directly imposed in the whole area covered by the cylinder with basis equal to the major ellipse inscribed in the cfd matrix 3 the venice experiment scientific literature describes several natural and artificial environments that experience an increasing impact due to navigation like the elbe estuary silinski et al 2015 the kiel canal uliczka and kondziella 2016 the hudson bay zheng et al 2016 the mississippi river system sorensen 1997 and many more the venice lagoon and its major waterway the malamocco marghera industrial channel hereinafter mm channel represent a paramount example of highly anthropized transitional environments sarretta et al 2010 therefore a joint effort based on two field campaigns the former investigating the passage of cruise ships the latter typical commercial ships and modeling was performed on the mm channel regardless of the peculiar characteristics of this study site there are substantial analogies with processes and impacts observed in other locations worldwide 3 1 study site description the venice lagoon 50 km long 10 km wide one of the largest mediterranean transitional environment was heavily modified in the last century in the early 1900 just after the stabilization of the three inlets with jetties an industrial district the porto marghera industrial zone was built at the western border of its central basin initially routed across the historic center of the city commercial ship traffic was successively redirected in the mm channel which was created on purpose in the late 60s to connect the industrial port to the sea through the malamocco inlet fig 3 the channel has a straight branch 200 m wide and 17 m deep along the east west direction that connects the inlet to the inner border of the lagoon it then narrows along the south north direction to a 120 m wide 12 m deep channel that reaches the port facilities the channel bed is 100 m and 60 m wide for the two segments respectively and its cross section is trapezoidal on its entire path after the excavation of the channel the proximal tidal flats of the central lagoon underwent a progressive generalized erosion molinaroli et al 2009 sarretta et al 2010 d alpaos 2010 a recent monitoring of sediment exchanges through time evidenced that material eroded from the central lagoon is not completely flushed away from the lagoon defendi et al 2010 but seems to be mainly deposited in the channels this trend would determine a general and progressive reduction of morphological feature diversity and loss of habitats in these specific areas sarretta et al 2010 zaggia et al 2017 in fact the port traffic progressively increased in terms of number of passengers and of number and dimension of cargos exposing such a morphodynamically active and peculiar transitional environment to additional stresses 3 2 field experiments ad hoc experimental activities were carried out to investigate ship induced currents and ship wave propagation over the tidal flats in the venice lagoon two field surveys were conducted on 18th 19th of july 2015 when large cruise ships reached the passenger terminal located in the historical center of venice passing through the mm channel on 29th 31st of march 2016 when additional instruments were deployed on the tidal flat bordering the mm channel commercial ships were monitored during this survey the field activity of the 18 19th of july 2015 was conducted on a portion of the mm channel 12 m deep and 150 m large bordered at west by an area that was reclaimed in the 60 for the expansion of the nearby industrial district of porto marghera and by an extended tidal flat to the east on this side of the channel the mudflat is protected by a breakwater structure located at a distance of about 100 m from the channel fig 4 an electromagnetic current meter interocean systems s4 recording at a frequency of 2 hz was deployed near bottom at 30 m east from the channel main axis station s2 fig 4 providing current velocity and direction pressure then converted in corresponding water level values and turbidity data a multi parametric probe idronaut ocean seven 304 ctd t equipped with pressure sensors working at 8 hz was deployed at the nearby tidal flat at about 100 m from the channel edge station b2 fig 4 the first field campaign was performed in spring tide conditions with maximum vertical water level excursion of 90 cm all ship passages were in temporal correspondence of the minimum value of tide low tide the second field activity on the 29th 31st of march 2016 was planned for the investigation on the tidal flat the instrumental setup was designed to give an accurate indication on the ship wave propagation even at large distance from the channel up to 1650 m fig 4 each station of the mudflat b2 b8 fig 4 was equipped with a pressure sensor with data logger rbr richard brancker researche instruments solo working at a sampling frequency of 16 hz at stations b2 and b4 two electromagnetic current meters interocean systems s4 were deployed sampling at frequencies of 2 hz and 5 hz respectively the relatively high sampling frequency was chosen to allow a fair description of the wave features over the innermost part of the tidal flat where the shape of the wave undergoes a strong modification of its front that introduces short period oscillations moreover the 2 hz frequency of the current meter in b2 is considered suitable for the description of the typical depression waves observed in the area rapaglia et al 2011 fig 4 shows also the cross sectional bathymetric profile acquired during the second field campaign ship passages were determined from the website https www marinetraffic com the provided information was on the ship passage time and speed while no data on ship tracks were available 3 3 model chain application the physical process that is studied is strongly influenced by the relative dimensions of the ship and the geometry of the channel thus given a channel geometry the principal parameters are the block coefficient and the draft the block coefficient is defined as the ratio between the displaced volume and the value of the product of the length the width and the draught of the ship c b l pp xb wl xt complete information about the shape of cruise ships in the venice lagoon was not available therefore to study a more realistic scenario the cfd simulations were conducted stretching the dimensions of a basic ship shape a japanese bulk carrier jbc mono propeller c b 0 85 for which the geometry was available the re shaping procedure has been pursued keeping fixed the value of the block coefficient to 0 7 typical of the cruise ships entering the venice lagoon as deduced from rapaglia et al 2011 and rapaglia et al 2015 which is considered as the main parameter affecting the physical model the limit of the adopted procedure is that bow and stern s phase could be somehow different from a typical cruise ship anyway this aspect provides larger effect on the generated wave pattern close to the ship and minor effects on the far field pattern moreover although bulk carriers can sometimes have large drafts up to 10 m the typical draft of cargo ships is comparable to cruise ships drafts monitored in the venice lagoon around 8 5 m two re shapings where considered and the principal dimensions of the two simulated ships are reported in table 1 ship1 was just stretched partially re shaped and linearly rescaled in order to reduce the jbc block coefficient to 0 7 from that keeping c b ship2 was re shaped to meet the dimensions of cruise ship costa deliziosa as much as possible for validation purposes the two re shapings represent the typologies of cruise ships sailing through the venice lagoon allowed inferences to be made on the impact of different draughts on the wave propagation simulations with xnavis were conducted in a rectilinear channel with a constant cross section corresponding to the geometry of the mm channel close to the investigated area fig 5 where the experimental measurements were performed in the simulations the channel was considered left right symmetric with the longitudinal axis of the ship corresponding to the channel axis therefore the numerical domain reproduced is one half of the channel the discretization of the fluid dynamical field around the ship is obtained exploiting the overlapping grids capabilities of the solver fig 5 left in particular two zones were considered one in the proximity of the ship hull and the other one covering the entire channel for the region close to the hull several structured overlapped and adjacent blocks body fitted on the surface of the hull are used the specific resolution is driven by geometrical consideration higher resolution in region of higher curvature and by fluid dynamics considerations higher resolution where larger gradients of the field variables are expected in particular the cells are only slightly clustered toward solid wall surfaces the simulation being inviscid in fact viscous forces have negligible effects on the wave pattern the domain of interest being small if compared with the major wavelength generating from the ship thus no relevant viscous dispersion happens the grid covers an area up to 660 m upstream and downstream the ship and 200 m laterally to accurately consider all the effects from the boundaries and the variation of the cross section of the channel a very fine discretization has been made ranging from 0 1 m to a few meters this accounts for about 22 millions of finite volumes used for the discretization of the channel and a total of 24 5 millions of volume for the whole cfd mesh we did not account for the effects produced by propellers as it is reasonable to consider them negligible for the propagation of the depression wave the air water interface was treated with a single level set technique which guarantees a fully non linear treatment of the free surface including its deformation to accurately describe the wave system a very refined grid resolution in the free surface region has been considered indeed the numerical tests performed with a fixed surface and linearized boundary conditions have shown less accuracy in the results and an underestimation of the ship wave amplitude the flow field is resolved in the ship reference system and velocity is considered stationary in fig 5 right the pressure field on the hull surface and on the bottom wall is reported as an example of cfd solution high pressure regions are seen close to the bow and the stern of the ship i e at the stagnation points whereas a rather large flat low pressure region is predicted along the side of the vessel it is interesting to note the deep depression that develops close to the stern region this is clearly a consequence of the acceleration of the flow beneath of the vessel due to the bernoulli effects the strong depression region is typical during the navigation in very shallow water and the consequent squat can cause ship grounding the 3d hydrodynamic outputs of xnavis interpolated on a cartesian block centered around the hull having resolution of 0 7 m 0 7 m 0 4 m in the x y z directions are used as forcing for the shyfem simulations the numerical mesh of shyfem describes with 26037 nodes and 51638 triangular elements resolution ranging from 3 m to 40 m see example of the mesh in fig 2 a portion of the venice lagoon adjacent to the mm channel fig 3 purple square the computational domain was chosen to represent the area covered by the field measurements the bathymetry is based on the dataset collected by magistrato alle acque di venezia mav in 2002 and merged with following surveys and on data measured by ismar cnr in 2014 in the main channels of the venice lagoon comparing the cross sectional bathymetric profile acquired during the second field campaign with the one obtained from this dataset some discrepancies arise the current tidal flats are slightly deeper about 30 cm and the channel slightly shallower 30 cm compared to the depth resulting from measurements of mav in 2002 the shyfem simulations run imposing 12 vertical sigma layers to reach at most a maximum thickness of 1 m in the mm channel and higher vertical resolution in shallower areas of the domain the coriolis effects are not considered due to the limited area of the domain tvd total variation diminishing schemes are used for horizontal and vertical advection the numerical experiments were performed evaluating a first ship ship1 in table 1 sailing at two different speeds 8 6 kn and 7 7 kn and a second ship ship 2 in table 1 sailing at 8 6 kn the three experiments were planned to validate the setup investigating the effect of a different ship geometry particularly the effect of draught at a given speed ship1 1 and ship2 1 table 2 and to state the variation in the wave signal just due to reduced velocities ship1 1 and ship1 2 table 2 for the specific channel simulated the mean water level was set to 23 cm to account for the tidal condition at the time of the observations 4 results and discussion 4 1 depression wave characterization and model validation the waves created by cruise ship passages were monitored in the investigated section during the field measurement of july 18 19th 2015 stations s2 in the channel and b2 in the tidal flats the sea surface elevation measured during the passage of the ship costa deliziosa the 19th of july 2015 at 4 28 utc in the mm channel directed to the cruise terminal is used to validate the model chain results fig 6 shows the comparison between the depression waves and currents taken during the passage of the ship costa deliziosa and the model chain results in correspondence of stations s2 in the channel and b2 in the nearby tidal flat as it was seen in previous works rapaglia et al 2011 parnell et al 2015 the depression wave developed in the channel is characterized by a deep trough with an almost symmetrical shape around the minimum level high frequency oscillations are registered before the maximum depression zmax in fig 1 and after the passage of the ship the former is probably due to local effects induced by the hull while the latter results from the interference of the primary depression wave with the secondary waves during the restoration of the pressure field in still conditions once the depression wave reaches the tidal flat position b2 the value of zmax is attenuated by the interaction with the bottom and the wave shape changes to the well documented asymmetric v shape fig 6 parnell et al 2015 the water level decreased at s2 of about 70 cm with respect to the still condition while on the tidal flat zmax was approximately 50 cm the instrument placed on the channel bottom recorded no clear evidence of an increase of the sea level at the beginning of the disturbance the ship1 1 simulation shows a maximum depression of 94 cm which overestimates the observation 71 cm the difference could partially be explained by a larger immersed surface of the hull corresponding to a draught of 8 7 m instead of the draught of the real case 8 0 m to verify this hypothesis and better understand the origin of the discrepancy we also considered the results from ship2 1 simulation which considers a smaller draught than ship1 1 simulation i e comparable with the one of the measured ship the results of this second run are in better agreement with the observations in s2 even if underestimating the measured value of about 10 cm a similar discrepancy is found at station b2 the computed waves for both simulated ships differ from measurements in reproducing the positive peak about 20 cm registered both in the channel and in the tidal flat before the depression analyzing the steady state field produced by xnavis we found that the model seems to enhance the peak due to the pressure effect at the bow and at the stern this discrepancy could probably be due to the numerical assumptions non viscous flow absence of the propeller additionally the simulated geometry being a re scaling of a bulk carrier type is different from the real ship and this aspect can influence the wave pattern producing lower local attenuation of the signal however due to the local nature of these processes characterized by wave lengths lower than the principal wave signal their influence is negligible on the wave propagation over the tidal flat the ship wave reproduced by the modeling chain reaches the tidal flat position b2 14 8 s earlier than the measurements probably the approximations applied for the shyfem set up as the hydrostatic approximation that inhibits the vertical acceleration and the shallow water approximation of equations can be responsible for the observed time shift however the time shift results smaller than the value obtained with other numerical approaches as for example the one proposed by parnell et al 2015 where the signal simulated by the 1d non linear model is slower and shows a delay of 40 s from measurements modeled bottom velocities were also assessed against measurements during the ship passage the measured current speed on the mm channel bottom was predominantly directed along the channel main axis negative values in fig 6 with a southward component of 120 cm s 1 three times larger than the westward component the measured signal in s2 shows a tidal current directed northward before the passage of the ship along the channel main axis during the ship passage first there is an increase in the current toward east followed by an opposite current the maximum value of current is higher than 1 m s 1 directed to south west we note not shown here that the disturbance induced by the ship lasted for about 15 min after the passage on both the channel and the tidal flat all simulations show a similar pattern of currents generated by the ship passage both in direction and speed the simulations do not consider the tide as forcing and this can justify the small discrepancies with the observations to interpret the noted discrepancies at least in the depression wave amplitude between measured and modeled results a theoretical model evaluating the energy balance of the process was applied following the approach proposed by schijf pianc 1987 it is possible to define a maximum ship speed suitable for navigation in restricted channels vl by solving the following implicit equation 3 v l g h 2 3 1 5 1 a m a c v l 2 2 g h 1 5 where h a c b w a m is the wetted area of ship at mid length a c is the wetted area of cross channel section b w is the width of the channel at the surface and b b is the width of the channel at the bottom fig 1 the mean water level depression d h can be computed solving the system 4 d h v s 2 2 g α 1 a c a w 2 1 a w b b h d h m h d h 2 a m where v s is the ship speed a w is the wetted cross sectional area at the ship passage h is the still water level m is the slope of the channel bank 1 1 4 0 4 v s v l the theoretical model was assessed against the results of measurements performed during the 18 19th of july 2015 campaign which have blockage ratio a m a c i e the ratio of the immersed ship area a m to channel cross sectional area a c fig 1 ranging from 0 13 to 0 16 and variable speed from 7 4 kn to 9 0 kn the full list of considered ships with their geometric characteristics speed and the measured zmax in s2 and b2 is reported in appendix the monitored ships generally navigate at higher speed while leaving the lagoon thus the corresponding zmax are larger compared to ships with same blockage ratios i e msc poesia msc magnifica and msc musica see appendix primarily it should be mentioned that the channel cross section has a different shape before and after the monitoring stations and consequently ships move through portions of channel that have different confinement blockage ratio additionally the route of the ships does not always follow the central axis of the channel therefore observed effects could differ from those expected despite the lack of information from the available measurements these aspects were analyzed in literature and studies can be mentioned that address it wang and zou 2014 lataire and vantorre 2008 and references therein entering a part of the channel with higher confinement lock increases the velocity of return flow with sudden changes in the hydrodynamics in the portion of channel where there is the highest change in the section meng et al 2015 moreover the presence of banks gives rise to interaction processes with the ship and if the ship is sailing closest to one of the channel sides eccentricity this would lead to asymmetries also in the lateral wave generation the lateral depression would be more pronounced and there could occur an attractive force that move the ship close to the bank lataire and vantorre 2008 therefore we should take into account the possible effects of bank effects shape distance slope and sailing trajectory possible eccentricity on the amplitude of the depression wave following the schijf formulation measured and theoretically expected depression wave amplitude are shown in fig 7 the maximum depression measured in s2 cannot be properly defined as zmax because the monitoring station does not correspond to the center of the channel and ship eccentricity is not known therefore the comparison is made between the measured maximum depression values and theoretical dh it has to be noted that some ships travelled with a speed exceeding the critical ship speed and therefore did not properly fulfill the assumptions of the approximate energy approach nevertheless the comparison shows agreement between measured and theoretical results with a mean absolute difference of about 12 cm which we assume acceptable within the adopted approximations indeed the channel section used for the computation has been approximated with a trapezoidal shape and the ship passages entering and exiting the channel were similarly treated even if the channel section changes before and after the monitored zone moreover there is no information about the eccentricity of the ship trajectory respect to the longitudinal axis of the channel a similar analysis using eccentricity of 15 m would increase the mean absolute difference of 3 cm all these aspects can justify the discrepancies between the theoretical computation and the measurements however the theoretical model allows quantifying the expected zmax induced by the ships confirming the correlation with ship speed and geometry blockage ratio by computing the mean depression wave with the schijf model for the cruise ship costa deliziosa passage taking into account the modeled geometries and speeds of ship1 and ship2 a zmax decrease of 15 cm due to the smaller area of the immersed section of the latter ship is expected that could finally explain the discrepancy seen in fig 6 the dissipation of potential energy between the channel center s2 and the tidal flat b2 is evaluated in fig 8 as the difference between zmax at the two locations for all the cruise ships that were measured in the 18 19th of july campaign in general the larger the disturbance in the channel and thus the current speed induced by the drawdown the larger the dissipation along the course between the two stations indeed the maximum difference of about 35 cm is associated with the shallower depression in the channel resulting in more than 90 cm in percentage the differences respect to the amplitude in the center of the channel range between 20 and 36 looking at fig 8 it can be noted that the model results are in reasonable agreement with measurements probably matching the dissipation processes that would justify the observed increase in the attenuation rate respect to the wave amplitude in the channel however there is a small overestimation 5 in modeled attenuation rates which could be ascribed to differences in the bathymetry imposed to the model the excess of modeled dissipation can be due to the above mentioned small discrepancy between the used and the real bathymetry with a shallower tidal flat close to the channel compared with the actual situation enhancing the effects of bottom stress 4 2 assessment of shipwave propagation on the tidal flats depression waves created by the traffic of commercial vessels container ships bulk carriers and tankers were acquired during the field measurements of the 29th 31st of march 2016 we monitored 40 ships navigating in the channel but only a sample of 16 vessels was used for the analysis after a quality check on the recorded data the observed and modeled depressions over the tidal flat stations are shown in fig 9 the seven stations shown b2 b8 fig 4 are located in a tidal flat zone that progressively varies from a depth of 1 9 b2 to 0 9 m b5 b6 and then to 1 5 m b7 b8 hence we expected most of the dissipation occurring within approximately the first kilometer from the channel axis the depression waves have a mean value of 33 cm in b2 where however values have a wide range 36 cm that depends on the different geometry and speed of the monitored ships the depression wave is progressively attenuated toward the center of the tidal flat passing from a mean value of 9 cm with a range of 8 cm at station b6 to a mean value of 6 cm at station b8 with a range of 6 cm this suggests that as expected the most dissipative region of the tidal flat is between b2 and b6 which corresponds to the zone with the largest gradient in water depth the deepest depressions in b2 are the ones that are damped the most in the propagation over this part of the tidal flat all the described features are evident in fig 10 where the wave attenuation over the tidal flat stations is defined as a percentage of the value in station b2 considering the average trend station b6 registers an attenuation of about 73 while in station b8 the attenuation is about 80 of the initial b2 value as an average this confirms that stations b2 and b6 where depth is decreasing progressively bound the area characterized by the maximum attenuation rate in b8 the minimum and maximum attenuations correspond to 68 and 91 fig 10 showing that a considerable range of attenuations occurs fig 10 also shows how over the tidal flats the modeled depression waves are generally larger than those measured in b2 in particular ship1 1 simulation at 8 6 kn speed in fact this run considers ship parameters that lead to a higher blockage ratio and ship speed compared to the ones in the measured dataset in any case the model dissipation reproduces fairly well the observed trend within station b2 and b5 where depth is progressively decreasing model outputs show that in the most distant stations from the channel center the signal is completely attenuated the modeling chain allows inferring about some specific dependency relations not always so easy to verify from measurements because of the variety of concurrent factors as the response of the system to varying speeds with a fixed geometry or to different ships traveling at the same speed in fig 11 the attenuation rate for the two simulations ship1 1 and ship1 2 is shown it is evident how the increase in ship speed enhances the amplitude of the depression and the attenuation rate the deepest the depression in the center of the channel the largest its interaction with the tidal flat dynamics by bottom stress effects and dissipation with consequences on the morphology of the channel tidal flat system on the other hand considering ship1 1 and ship2 1 simulations it is evident that the ship with the smaller draft propagated a smaller depression wave 61 cm vs 95 cm another important aspect that is evidenced by fig 11 is that ships with smaller draught but higher speeds ship2 1 simulation 8 6 kn produced a slightly smaller depression compared to bigger ships traveling at lower speeds ship1 2 simulation 7 7 kn in order to complete the analysis of the three simulation results we evaluate the distributions of maximum depression and normalized maximum depression referred to the residual water level fig 12 what can be deduced is that for all simulations for the test velocities the area characterized by maximum depressions deeper than 10 cm reaches the tidal flat identifying a possible area of influence due to the ship passage within station b4 this aspect is in good agreement with the results of measurements comparing ship 1 1 and ship 1 2 the increase in speed does not change significantly the area of influence but the maximum depressions are larger particularly in the tidal flat close to the channel normalized maximum depression 0 4 vs 0 5 if we consider the passage of different ships at the same velocity ship 1 1 and ship 2 1 an enlargement of the area of influence for the ship with the bigger draft is found also the absolute maximum depressions are bigger therefore it can be concluded that the passage of a ship with bigger dimensions deeper draft but lower speed influences a larger area of the tidal flat than a ship with smaller dimensions and higher speed 5 conclusions and perspectives ship wakes formation and propagation in confined channels is a topic tackled by several scientists and engineers dealing with theoretical issues and impacts on coastal environments this research work tests a numerical methodology that keeps the required degree of physical complexity and provides outcomes of primary importance for environmental protection and easily applicable for management the tool allows for the investigation of the hydrodynamics in a waterway around the ship hull through a cfd solver and propagation of the pressure perturbation in the surrounding shallow areas through a shallow water unstructured model the novelty of the proposed approach is the combined implementation of different numerical tools able to provide an accurate description of both the local and far field processes this approach could eventually include local effects related to the viscosity and the presence of propellers considering highly detailed ship geometries although some approximations were introduced in the proposed approach the numerical model chain has been successfully validated against observations of water levels and currents collected in the venice lagoon the modeling tool complements the information from the field activities and previous works investigating the what if option connected with different ship sizes or navigation speed these are two factors influencing the shape and propagation of lateral wave level depression among a number of other ones which can be better analyzed when data for comparison are available such as the channel geometry width depth bank slope and the real ship track eccentricity the first test evidenced how the ship geometry plays a fundamental role in producing ship wakes that can be still visible at a large distance from the navigation channel over the tidal flat for the considered ship speed range still higher than the existing speed limits for navigation in the channel but consistent with the velocities measured during ship transits in our field experiments smaller and faster ships seem to have less impact on the tidal flat than bigger vessels navigating at relatively lower speeds further sensitivity analyses can provide a full range of options within the maximum minimum speed limits that guarantee ship maneuverability which could easily be considered in specific decision support systems dss this analysis suggests that the developed tools could be further refined to introduce other hydrodynamic drivers like atmospheric forcing and tides needed to match the complexity of the real case moreover the numerical models could be also used to investigate the effect of ship waves on sediment resuspension and morphodynamics of complex coastal systems

23494,motivated by new technologies such as internet of things big data cloud computing data driven based smart maritime related research is attracting more and more attention with the establishment of china automatic identification system ais asia pacific data center and its network with iala net worldwide ship trajectory data is becoming increasingly available thus providing plenty of materials for data driven based smart maritime researches this paper presents a novel approach to automatic maritime routing algorithm given a set of ship trajectories infer a routable road network by combining data driven based algorithms specially by focusing on i after appropriate pre processing simplify ais trajectory data using douglas peucker algorithm which can simplify ais trajectory data by extracting characteristic points in the meanwhile compressing redundant information and improving subsequent processing efficiency ii by setting similarity metric of characteristic points cluster them using dbscan algorithm consequently deduce general behavior and spatial pattern of trajectories following the similar route also the turning nodes of routes can be obtained in this step unlike past

introduction nowadays new technologies new concepts represented by big data data mining pattern recognition attract a wide spread attention supported by these data science and technologies are profound changing the traditional way of science exploration and becoming a new model of technological development and knowledge acquisition wang et al 2014 maritime route planning is a procedure to develop a routable road network of a vessel s voyage from the designated departure port and destination port the planning includes many turning nodes in chronological order in the form of latitude and longitude the industry term is berth to berth according to international law a vessel s captain is legally responsible for route planning the duty of route planning is usually delegated to the ship s navigation officer typically the second officer on merchant ships this paper presents an automatic maritime routing algorithm given a set of ship trajectories infer a routable road network traditional maritime routing planning needs mariners to look up enormous amounts of navigation related material such as sailing direction guide to port entry notice to mariners and admiralty list of lights and fog signals when planning a route meanwhile mariners are required to refer to previous similar routes it is a time and energy consuming work even for an experienced mariner ais is an automatic tracking and self reporting system for identifying and locating vessels by electronically exchanging data among other nearby ships ais base stations and satellites the widespread use of ais has provided much more opportunities to trace vessel movements than ever before and ship trajectory data is becoming increasingly available when analyzing the ship trajectories over a long period of time the general behavior and implicit movement patterns of ship trajectories that follows the similar route can be learned using incremental clustering and pattern recognition technologies based on ship trajectories and data driven based technologies the optimal route the shortest reasonable path can be generated automatically the route can be the preliminary preplanning and visual route schedule in the process of route planning in marine navigation mariners only need to check the rationality and feasibility of the route generated automatically instead of planning from scratch in this paper we propose an automatic maritime route generation algorithm that takes ship ais trajectories as input designed to consume low memory mitigate ais noise and disparity and scale to a large database this work is organized as follows section 2 describes related work on automatic route generation techniques section 3 discussed the methods proposed regarding trajectories pre processing trajectories compression characteristic points of trajectories cluster turning nodes generation and their connectivity conclusions and future work are addressed in section 4 2 related work navigation systems assist almost all kind of means of transportation including marine navigation aviation and driving edelkamp and schrödl 2003 the past decade has witnessed a great deal of academic achievements in building road maps automatically from gps trajectories biagioni and eriksson 2012 liu et al 2012 ahmed et al 2015 existing approaches described in the literature can be classified into three general categories k means algorithms kernel density estimation kde and trace merging generally k means based methods begin by distributing a series of cluster seed along trajectories randomly or at a fixed interval then finding cluster seeds locations and or directions that best describe its nearby trajectories using the cluster seeds as initial guesses edelkamp and schrödl 2003 schroedl et al 2004 worrall and nebot 2007 agamennoni et al 2011 kde based methods first produce a kernel density estimate of ship trajectories and then co opt image processing techniques to produce a binary image of the road and use its contour lines to calculate the centerlines davies et al 2006 chen and cheng 2008 trace merging based methods thus far use a greedy approach which clusters nearby trajectories that have similarity in location and bearing and then approximate their centerlines using various fitting method cao and krumm 2009 niehofer et al 2009 ahmed and wenk 2012 as we can see many communities have addressed this problem compared to the plentiful and substantial achievements in road transportation automatic maritime routing remains in the relatively backward state although automatic maritime routing can be drawn on the experience of technologies in road transportation there are still some differences between them on the one hand trajectories in road transportation are movement constrained constrains can be in form of an explicit road network in which the trajectories move ahmed and wenk 2012 turning nodes and intersection nodes are also fixed in maritime navigation trajectories are relatively dispersed because navigable waters are broad on the other hand existing automatic road routing methods are based on the assumptions that trajectories are frequently sampled uniformly distributed and low noise karagiorgou et al 2013 which limits their applicability and effectiveness in the marine field in this paper we demonstrate a new scheme and implementation of automatic maritime routing that takes the characteristics of ship trajectories into consideration detailed information can be seen in section 3 3 automatic maritime routing in this section the architecture and implementation of automatic maritime routing method is introduced as illustrated in fig 1 the whole architecture can be divided into five essential parts trajectories pre processing trajectories compression and characteristic points extraction characteristic points cluster and turning nodes generation turning nodes linkage and road network generation 3 1 trajectories pre process trajectories pre process is the process of turning raw ais coordinate points into a data structure which can be efficiently used in the proposed method each ship has an ais registration at a time interval from 2 s to 6 min which depends on their motion international telecommunications union 2014 the information broadcasted by ais consists of the ship s name maritime mobile service identify mmsi timestamp longitude latitude and other sailing related configurations and it is in form of a standard ascii stream so the first pro process step is to decode the ascii stream into plaint text and store it in the sqlite database each record in the sqlite database denotes a piece of information broadcasted by ship borne ais one time the trajectory is a trace generated by ais represented by of a series of chronologically ordered coordinate points e g t p 0 p 1 p n where each point consists of an id a coordinate set and timestamp such as p mmsi longitude latitude t following extraction of the relevant data needed for automatic routing from the parsed ais data items a filtering step is needed the filter step is realized to check for and eliminate any irregular positions or erroneous positions due to a malfunction of the positioning system or transmission errors 3 2 trajectories compression and characteristic points extraction a trajectory is approximated by discrete samples of the ais coordinate point the higher the sampling rate the more accurate the trajectory will be but this will result in a massive amount of data creating overhead problem with storing transmitting and processing how to achieve a good balance between high rate compression and feature points preservation is very difficult in practice thus it is vital to design data simplification techniques that compress the size of a trajectory without sacrificing the quality of the trajectory required for automatic maritime routing application in view of ship s special maneuverability characteristic it is normal to sail in a predictable and straight route it turns out that a large number of raw ais coordinate position updates can be compressed with negligible losses in accuracy as they hardly contribute additional knowledge about maritime motion pattern patroumpas 2013 this situation will require a simplification method both to compress the redundant information and to maintain the main characteristic of the original trajectory 3 2 1 douglas peucker algorithm as mentioned a trajectory is a series of chronologically ordered coordinate points so it is a sort of special line thus a line simplification method can be used for trajectory compression several studies have evaluated and analyzed various line generalization methods perceptually and mathematically and considered the douglas peucker dp algorithm douglas and peucker 1973 as one of the most accurate line simplification algorithms jenks 1981 white 1985 mcmaster 1986 cheung and shi 2006 the core concept of the dp compression method is to replace the original trajectory by an approximated line segment fig 2 illustrates the main steps of dp method as shown in step 1 the starting point p 0 and the ending point p 11 is connected to generate an approximated line segment then the perpendicular euclidean distance of each remaining point in the original trajectory to the approximated line segment is computed if all of the distances are less than the pre defined compression threshold τ the trajectory can be approximate by line segment p 0 p 11 supposed some of the distances are greater than the compression threshold τ the trajectory point deviating most from the line segment is selected as characteristic point such as p 7 in fig 2 a and partitions the original problem into two sub problems as a result in step 2 line segment p 0 p 7 is used to approximate the first sub trajectory p 0 p 1 p 7 and line segment p 7 p 11 is used to approximate the second sub trajectory p 7 p 8 p 11 in the first sub problems several trajectory point have their perpendicular euclidean distances to their corresponding approximated line segment p 0 p 7 greater than the compression threshold τ for the same reason the most deviating trajectory point is chosen as a characteristic point e g p 3 in fig 2 b and the partition is processed recursively until all the perpendicular distances of trajectory point in the original trajectory to their corresponding line segment are less than the pre defined compression threshold on the other hand in the second sub problem all the trajectory points have their perpendicular distances to the corresponding line segment p 7 p 11 within the pre defined compression threshold τ thus further partition is not necessary 3 2 2 extraction of characteristic points using sql statement ship trajectory points ordered by timestamp sharing the same mmsi can be queried at once and stored in an array or list container for trajectory compression the sample data used in this study are trajectories of 962 ships collected for 11 days of qiongzhou strait ais base station the total number of recorded ais position reports is 5 902 840 as for the simplification threshold the solo parameter of dp algorithm ais based minimum ship domain evaluation method can be used and acted as criteria for the simplification threshold determination zhang et al 2016 have carried out numerical experiments the compression threshold is set as 0 8 times ship s length for different ship s parameters and maneuverability after simplifying the total number of recorded ais position reports is 103 078 so the compression rate is 98 25 an example is illustrated in fig 3 import a ship s original trajectory and simplified trajectory using dp algorithm into ecdis electronic chart display and information system separately as shown by compiling the characteristic points derived by dp algorithm in chronological order the simplified trajectory can offer all the essential information almost as accurately as the original trajectory the characteristic points can reconstruct an approximate yet quiet reliable trajectory as fig 3 depict clearly in view that different trajectory points in the original trajectory contain different amount of information required to represent the trajectory some of them are just redundant information as they can be obtained by linear interpolation of the characteristic points consequently the simplified trajectory generated by chronologically linked characteristic points is a feasible and rational means to approximate the original trajectory meanwhile the simplified trajectory can save storage space and improve process efficiency last but certainly not least as shown in fig 4 the trajectory characteristic and pattern depicted by the simplified trajectory is more distinct and clear compared to the original trajectory 3 3 turning nodes generation the main object of this part is to detect significant direction changes in every trajectory and define them as turning points then cluster the turn points using dbscan density based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm so as to identify the common turning nodes the rationality behind this is that although trajectories are independent of each other they often choose similar routes between locations such as minimum time route minimum distance route as illustrated in fig 5 when huge volumes of trajectories in a given spatial area are displayed in ecdis platform an accurate picture of the macro traffic situation can be seen for the same reason when large amounts of turning points along the similar route are superimposed the common turning nodes will become apparent see fig 6 3 3 1 turning points recognition according to the specifications of international regulations for preventing collision at sea colregs and good seamanship any alteration of course to avoid collision shall if the circumstance of the case admits be large enough to be

when all the density connected points are found in another round a new unvisited point is retrieved and discovers another cluster an illustration of dbscan algorithm can be seen in fig 7 3 3 3 turning points cluster and turning node generation clustering is the process of dividing points into groups according to the definition of similarity so that members in the same group are similar and members in the distinct groups are dissimilar having recognized turning points the question that remains answered is how to cluster them into turning nodes in the dbscan clustering algorithm there are two criteria distance criterion and minimum point criterion to constitute a cluster in the clustering of turning points the domain knowledge is exploited to discriminate what a reasonable turning node should be the turning points are grouped using dbsacn clustering algorithm according to two criteria spatial proximity and turn similarity the spatial proximity refers to the fact that turning points in the same cluster group are in the vicinity of a predefined area the turn similarity refers to the similarity of turning angle direction in and direction out of different turning points in the same cluster group however due to the density disparities between different routes in different marine areas no single set of criteria can satisfy all the circumstances that are both inclusive and accurate for example the turning points form almost a cloud with noise in the traffic intensive area therefore strict criteria are needed for clustering to get the turning node and filter out noisy turning points on the contrary in traffic sparse areas relative loose criteria are needed to avoid treating these sparse turning points as noise in this paper a hierarchical dbscan clustering algorithm is

turning node linkage in this stage the isolated turning nodes have been obtained by clustering turning points the following work focuses on the detection of a linkage between the turning nodes by application of the simplified trajectories in essence whether two turning nodes can be linked directly can be determined by the turning points that constitute these two turning nodes in other words two turning nodes which can be linked directly will be typically connected by a quantity of trajectories the intersection set of constitution mmsis of these two turning nodes won t be empty in practical the turning nodes are retrieved according to mmsi using the sql statement turning nodes containing specific mmsi can be queried at once and stored in an array or list container it starts with an arbitrary turning node in the container and retrieves its nearest turning node in spatial distance supposed there are two turning nodes tn 1 and tn 2 the course between tn 1 and tn 2 is c tn and whether they can be linked directly is determined by the following criteria tn 1 direction out is approximately equal to tn 2 direction in as depicted in fig 10 a or tn 1 direction out is approximately equal to c tn as depicted in fig 10 c or tn 2 direction in is approximately equal to c tn as depicted in fig 10 d and tn 1 direction out tn 2 direction out must be less than 180 as depicted in fig 10 b although tn 2 direction in is approximately equal to c tn which is not a valid linkage at this stage we succeed in linking the isolated turning nodes together to form a coherent chain modeled as a directed graph g tn l where tn refers to the turning nodes describing the geometry of route network and l refers to linkage describing connectivity of the route network 3 5 automatic routing after getting the directed graph g tn l the next problem to be solved is how to find the shortest route according to the designated starting turning node and ending turning node ant colony optimization aco is a discrete optimization technique that inspired from the behavior of ants seeking a path between food and their cave the first aco system was proposed by marco dorigo in 1992 in his phd thesis dorigo 1992 and was focusing on finding optimal paths in a graph initially it was introduced to solve the travelling salesman problem tsp dorigo and gambardella 1997 now the original idea has been diversified to solve various heuristic optimization problems mohan and baskaran 2012 detailed description of aco can be found in ant colony optimization dorigo and stützle 2004 given a starting turning node the ants choose their next turning node according to the pheromone trail level supposed τ ij t denotes the pheromone trail level between the turning nodes i and j at time t and τ ij 0 const in general the kth ant moves from turning node i to turning node j with the following probability 2 p i j k t τ i j t α η i j t β k a l l o w e d τ i k t α η i k t β if j a l l o w e d k 0 o t h e r w i s e in the equation the allowed k means the next allowed turning node from the current turning node the information can be obtained from the linkage between the two turning nodes according to the directed graph g tn l η ij is the desirability of transition from turning node i to j it typically equals to 1 d ij where d ij is the distance between i to j α is one heuristic parameter to control the influence of τ ij the higher it is the more likely the ant chooses the path that other ants have passed β is the other heuristic parameter to control the influence of η ij the higher it is the more likely the ant choose the shortest distance path of all allowed paths after all the ants have finished their solutions the pheromone trail level will be updated according to the following equation 3 τ i j t n 1 ρ τ i j t k 1 m τ i j k t in the equation ρ is the pheromone evaporation coefficient and ρ 0 1 over time the pheromone trail begins to evaporate in order to avoid paths chosen by the first ants to be excessively attractive to the following ones which tend to lead the convergence to a locally optimal solution the second part means the increment of pheromone trail from the turning point i to j between time t to t n in the equation t means the time when a new tour round begin and n means the time all the ants needed to finish their solutions in each tour round the pheromone trail level between the turning nodes i and j τ ij updates once in each tour round the amount of pheromone trail deposited by the kth ant is typically calculated by the following equation 4 δ τ i j k t q l k if the k th ant passes ij 0 o t h e r w i s e in the equation q means the gross pheromone trail and it is a constant the l k means the distance travelled by the kth ant in its tour if the kth ant passes from turning node i to turning node j in its tour the corresponding pheromone trail will be updated according to the equation thus the shortest path between the designated starting turning node and the ending turning node can be found in every tour round and the positive feedback of the ant colony algorithm eventually leads to the generation of the optimal path in all tour rounds of every ant the flowchart of using aco to find the optimal path in the directed graph can be seen in fig 11 two exemplary routes which have applied the automatic routing method proposed in this paper can be seen in fig 12 and fig 13 as shown in the figures the example route follows the specifications of international regulations for preventing collision at sea which require the vessel using the traffic separation scheme shall proceed in the appropriate traffic lane in the general direction of traffic flow for that lane the main procedures of applying aco to automatic routing can be summarized as follows the parameter t means tour round index and k means ant index the parameter m is designated number of ants and tmax is the maximum limit of tour round 1 parameters initialization given the directed graph of turning node g tn l designate the amount of ants m and the maximum limit of tour round tmax initialize t 0 and k 0 τ ij 0 const 2 the amount of tour round t t 1 and the ant in this tour k k 1 3 the kth ant chooses and goes forward to the next turning node according to the probability calculated by equation 2 meantime the selected turning node is removed from the allowable table of the kth ant this procedure stops until the kth ant reaches the ending turning node on the premise that there does exist a path from the starting to the ending turning node 4 after all ants have reached the ending turning node the pheromone trail level between turning node will be updated according to the m ants tour and equation 3 5 the optimal path in the tth tour round is reserved 6 start a new tour round t t 1 and repeat procedures 2 3 4 and 5 7 after tmax tour rounds are finished the optimal path in all tour rounds are selected 4 conclusion this paper proposes a novel approach to automatic maritime routing from large collections of opportunistically collected ais trajectories this kind of trajectories is bound to be large scale coarse grained and disparate in coverage data driven based algorithms are used to infer maritime route in nutshell a simplification algorithm is used to compress the redundant information in the original trajectories to improve subsequent processing efficiency for which to deal with a large dataset then changes in the direction of simplified trajectory are exploited to identify turning points and to cluster them using dbscan algorithm according to spatial proximity and turn similarity to derive turning nodes after getting the linkage between turning nodes aco is used to find the optimal path from the starting turning node to the ending turning node in this paper we focus primarily on basic automatic maritime routing some parameters used in dbscan and aco were established empirically by running a series of experiments to tune the method to its optimal performance however averaging and approximation are used in the proposed automatic routing algorithm an overreliance on the automatic generated route increases navigation risks such as grounding the seafarers responsibility of route planning and route safety validation can t be exempted by using the automatic routing algorithm even though this paper has solved the basic problem of automatic maritime routing different enhanced aspects that take more relevant factors and more advanced criterion into consideration are still remaining to be settled such as dynamic weather routing minimizing time or fuel consumption routing dynamic routing according to colregs future research will be focused on this direction on the another hand data driven based automatic routing algorithm relies on enormous up to data ais trajectories potential risk of navigation safety will be increased if the trajectory data can t be updated timely for example supposed the traffic separation scheme of chengshantou sea area is changed by maritime authority vessels will follow the new scheme if the ais trajectories used in the algorithm proposed in this paper can t reflect this change potential collision risk is exist so the rationality and feasibility of the route generated automatically is needed to check acknowledgements this work

23494,motivated by new technologies such as internet of things big data cloud computing data driven based smart maritime related research is attracting more and more attention with the establishment of china automatic identification system ais asia pacific data center and its network with iala net worldwide ship trajectory data is becoming increasingly available thus providing plenty of materials

introduction nowadays new technologies new concepts represented by big data data mining pattern recognition attract a wide spread attention supported by these data science and technologies are profound changing the traditional way of science exploration and becoming a new model of technological development and knowledge acquisition wang et al 2014 maritime route planning is a procedure to develop a routable road network of a vessel s voyage from the designated departure port and destination port the planning includes many turning nodes in chronological order in the form of latitude and longitude the industry term is berth to berth according to international law a vessel s captain is legally responsible for route planning the duty of route planning is usually delegated to the ship s navigation officer typically the second officer on merchant ships this paper presents an automatic maritime routing algorithm given a set of ship trajectories infer a routable road network traditional maritime routing planning needs mariners to look up enormous amounts of navigation related material such as sailing direction guide to port entry notice to mariners and admiralty list of lights and fog signals when planning a route meanwhile mariners are required to refer to previous similar routes it is a time and energy consuming work even for an experienced mariner ais is an automatic tracking and self reporting system for identifying and locating vessels by electronically exchanging data among other nearby ships ais base stations and satellites the widespread use of ais has provided much more opportunities to trace vessel movements than ever before and ship trajectory data is becoming increasingly available when analyzing the ship trajectories over a long period of time the general behavior and implicit movement patterns of ship trajectories that follows the similar route can be learned using incremental clustering and pattern recognition technologies based on ship trajectories and data driven based technologies the optimal route the shortest reasonable path can be generated automatically the route can be the preliminary preplanning and visual route schedule in the process of route planning in marine navigation mariners only need to check the rationality and feasibility of the route generated automatically instead of planning from scratch in this paper we propose an automatic maritime route generation algorithm that takes ship ais trajectories as input designed to consume low memory mitigate ais noise and disparity and scale to a large database this work is organized as follows section 2 describes related work on automatic route generation techniques section 3 discussed the methods proposed regarding trajectories pre processing trajectories compression characteristic points of trajectories cluster turning nodes generation and their connectivity conclusions and future work are addressed in section 4 2 related work navigation systems assist almost all kind of means of transportation including marine navigation aviation and driving edelkamp and schrödl 2003 the past decade has witnessed a great deal of academic achievements in building road maps automatically from gps trajectories biagioni and eriksson 2012 liu et al 2012 ahmed et al 2015 existing approaches described in the literature can be classified into three general categories k means algorithms kernel density estimation kde and trace merging generally k means based methods begin by distributing a series of cluster seed along trajectories randomly or at a fixed interval then finding cluster seeds locations and or directions that best describe its nearby trajectories using the cluster seeds as initial guesses edelkamp and schrödl 2003 schroedl et al 2004 worrall and nebot 2007 agamennoni et al 2011 kde based methods first produce a kernel density estimate of ship trajectories and then co opt image processing techniques to produce a binary image of the road and use its contour lines to calculate the centerlines davies et al 2006 chen and cheng 2008 trace merging based methods thus far use a greedy approach which clusters nearby trajectories that have similarity in location and bearing and then approximate their centerlines using various fitting method cao and krumm 2009 niehofer et al 2009 ahmed and wenk 2012 as we can see many communities have addressed this problem compared to the plentiful and substantial achievements in road transportation automatic maritime routing remains in the relatively backward state although automatic maritime routing can be drawn on the experience of technologies in road transportation there are still some differences between them on the one hand trajectories in road transportation are movement constrained constrains can be in form of an explicit road network in which the trajectories move ahmed and wenk 2012 turning nodes and intersection nodes are also fixed in maritime navigation trajectories are relatively dispersed because navigable waters are broad on the other hand existing automatic road routing methods are based on the assumptions that trajectories are frequently sampled uniformly distributed and low noise karagiorgou et al 2013 which limits their applicability and effectiveness in the marine field in this paper we demonstrate a new scheme and implementation of automatic maritime routing that takes the characteristics of ship trajectories into consideration detailed information can be seen in section 3 3 automatic maritime routing in this section the architecture and implementation of automatic maritime routing method is introduced as illustrated in fig 1 the whole architecture can be divided into five essential parts trajectories pre processing trajectories compression and characteristic points extraction characteristic points cluster and turning nodes generation turning nodes linkage and road network generation 3 1 trajectories pre process trajectories pre process is the process of turning raw ais coordinate points into a data structure which can be efficiently used in the proposed method each ship has an ais registration at a time interval from 2 s to 6 min which depends on their motion international telecommunications union 2014 the information broadcasted by ais consists of the ship s name maritime mobile service identify mmsi timestamp longitude latitude and other sailing related configurations and it is in form of a standard ascii stream so the first pro process step is to decode the ascii stream into plaint text and store it in the sqlite database each record in the sqlite database denotes a piece of information broadcasted by ship borne ais one time the trajectory is a trace generated by ais represented by of a series of chronologically ordered coordinate points e g t p 0 p 1 p n where each point consists of an id a coordinate set and timestamp such as p mmsi longitude latitude t following extraction of the relevant data needed for automatic routing from the parsed ais data items a filtering step is needed the filter step is realized to check for and eliminate any irregular positions or erroneous positions due to a malfunction of the positioning system or transmission errors 3 2 trajectories compression and characteristic points extraction a trajectory is approximated by discrete samples of the ais coordinate point the higher the sampling rate the more accurate the trajectory will be but this will result in a massive amount of data creating overhead problem with storing transmitting and processing how to achieve a good balance between high rate compression and feature points preservation is very difficult in practice thus it is vital to design data simplification techniques that compress the size of a trajectory without sacrificing the quality of the trajectory required for automatic maritime routing application in view of ship s special maneuverability characteristic it is normal to sail in a predictable and straight route it turns out that a large number of raw ais coordinate position updates can be compressed with negligible losses in accuracy as they hardly contribute additional knowledge about maritime motion pattern patroumpas 2013 this situation will require a simplification method both to compress the redundant information and to maintain the main characteristic of the original trajectory 3 2 1 douglas peucker algorithm as mentioned a trajectory is a series of chronologically ordered coordinate points so it is a sort of special line thus a line simplification method can be used for trajectory compression several studies have evaluated and analyzed various line generalization methods perceptually and mathematically and considered the douglas peucker dp algorithm douglas and peucker 1973 as one of the most accurate line simplification algorithms jenks 1981 white 1985 mcmaster 1986 cheung and shi 2006 the core concept of the dp compression method is to replace the original trajectory by an approximated line segment fig 2 illustrates the main steps of dp method as shown in step 1 the starting point p 0 and the ending point p 11 is connected to generate an approximated line segment then the perpendicular euclidean distance of each remaining point in the original trajectory to the approximated line segment is computed if all of the distances are less than the pre defined compression threshold τ the trajectory can be approximate by line segment p 0 p 11 supposed some of the distances are greater than the compression threshold τ the trajectory point deviating most from the line segment is selected as characteristic point such as p 7 in fig 2 a and partitions the original problem into two sub problems as a result in step 2 line segment p 0 p 7 is used to approximate the first sub trajectory p 0 p 1 p 7 and line segment p 7 p 11 is used to approximate the second sub trajectory p 7 p 8 p 11 in the first sub problems several trajectory point have their perpendicular euclidean distances to their corresponding approximated line segment p 0 p 7 greater than the compression threshold τ for the same reason the most deviating trajectory point is chosen as a characteristic point e g p 3 in fig 2 b and the partition is processed recursively until all the perpendicular distances of trajectory point in the original trajectory to their corresponding line segment are less than the pre defined compression threshold on the other hand in the second sub problem all the trajectory points have their perpendicular distances to the corresponding line segment p 7 p 11 within the pre defined compression threshold τ thus further partition is not necessary 3 2 2 extraction of characteristic points using sql statement ship trajectory points ordered by timestamp sharing the same mmsi can be queried at once and stored in an array or list container for trajectory compression the sample data used in this study are trajectories of 962 ships collected for 11 days of qiongzhou strait ais base station the total number of recorded ais position reports is 5 902 840 as for the simplification threshold the solo parameter of dp algorithm ais based minimum ship domain evaluation method can be used and acted as criteria for the simplification threshold determination zhang et al 2016 have carried out numerical experiments the compression threshold is set as 0 8 times ship s length for different ship s parameters and maneuverability after simplifying the total number of recorded ais position reports is 103 078 so the compression rate is 98 25 an example is illustrated in fig 3 import a ship s original trajectory and simplified trajectory using dp algorithm into ecdis electronic chart display and information system separately as shown by compiling the characteristic points derived by dp algorithm in chronological order the simplified trajectory can offer all the essential information almost as accurately as the original trajectory the characteristic points can reconstruct an approximate yet quiet reliable trajectory as fig 3 depict clearly in view that different trajectory points in the original trajectory contain different amount of information required to represent the trajectory some of them are just redundant information as they can be obtained by linear interpolation of the characteristic points consequently the simplified trajectory generated by chronologically linked characteristic points is a feasible and rational means to approximate the original trajectory meanwhile the simplified trajectory can save storage space and improve process efficiency last but certainly not least as shown in fig 4 the trajectory characteristic and pattern depicted by the simplified trajectory is more distinct and clear compared to the original trajectory 3 3 turning nodes generation the main object of this part is to detect significant direction changes in every trajectory and define them as turning points then cluster the turn points using dbscan density based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm so as to identify the common turning nodes the rationality behind this is that although trajectories are independent of each other they often choose similar routes between locations such as minimum time route minimum distance route as illustrated in fig 5 when huge volumes of trajectories in a given spatial area are displayed in ecdis platform an accurate picture of the macro traffic situation can be seen for the same reason when large amounts of turning points along the similar route are superimposed the common turning nodes will become apparent see fig 6 3 3 1 turning points recognition according to the specifications of international regulations for preventing collision at sea colregs and good seamanship any alteration of course to avoid collision shall if the circumstance of the case admits be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar a succession of small alterations of course should be avoided in this paper 5 degree of course alteration is chosen as the indicator of turning point sample this parameter is chosen relative conservatively as false positives will eventually be eliminated by the clustering process supposed the simplified trajectory is represented as t p 0 p 1 p 2 with p φ λ the course c p0p1 between p 0 and p 1 can be calculated by the following equation according to mercator projection 1 m p φ 7915 70447 lg tan π 4 φ 2 1 ⅇ sin φ 1 ⅇ sin φ ⅇ 2 c p 0 p 1 arctan λ 1 λ 0 m p φ 1 m p φ 0 in equation 1 the mp refers to meridian parts at latitude φ and e refers to the first eccentricity of earth ellipsoid also the course c p1p2 between p 1 and p 2 can be calculated using the same equation then the turning angle t p0p1p2 between line segment p 0 p 1 and line segment p 1 p 2 can be calculated according to c p0p1 and c p1p2 if t p0p1p2 is greater than 5 the ais position report p 1 will be marked as turning point for each generated turning point in addition to its position we also record another four parameters mmsi turning angle c p0p1 defined as direction in and c p1p2 defined as direction out so a valid turning point is described by six parameters turing point mmsi longitude latitude turning angle direction in direction out 3 3 2 dbscan

point p is directly density reachable from a point q if p nh ε q and q is a core point a point p is density reachable from a point q if there exists a chain of points p 1 p 2 p n with p 1 q and p n p where p i 1 is directly density reachable from p i a point p is density connected to a point q if there exists a point r s and both p and q are density reachable from r a point p is an outlier point if it is not reachable from any other points at the beginning of dbscan cluster algorithm each point in the dataset is marked as unvisited it starts with an arbitrary point and retrieves its ε neighborhood meanwhile the point is labeled as visited if its nh ε is greater than minpts a cluster is formed then for each unvisited point in this cluster repeat the same retrieve process and end when all the density connected points are found in another round a new unvisited point is retrieved and discovers another cluster an illustration of dbscan algorithm can be seen in fig 7 3 3 3 turning

following equation 3 τ i j t n 1 ρ τ i j t k 1 m τ i j k t in the equation ρ is the pheromone evaporation coefficient and ρ 0 1 over time the pheromone trail begins to evaporate in order to avoid paths chosen by the first ants to be excessively attractive to the following ones which tend to lead the convergence to a locally optimal solution the second part means the increment of pheromone trail from the turning point i to j between time t to t n in the equation t means the time when a new tour round begin and n means the time all the ants needed to finish their solutions in each tour round the pheromone trail level between the turning nodes i and j τ ij updates once in each tour round the amount of pheromone trail deposited by the kth ant is typically calculated by the following equation 4 δ τ i j k t q l k if the k th ant passes ij 0 o t h e r w i s e in the equation q means the gross pheromone trail and it is a constant the l k means the distance travelled by the kth ant in its tour if the kth ant passes from turning node i to turning node j in its tour the corresponding pheromone trail will be updated according to the equation thus the shortest path between the designated starting turning node and the ending turning node can be found in every tour round and the positive feedback of the ant colony algorithm eventually leads to the generation of the optimal path in all tour rounds of every ant the flowchart of using aco to find the optimal path in the directed graph can be seen in fig 11 two exemplary routes which have applied the automatic routing method proposed in this paper can be seen in fig 12 and fig 13 as shown in the figures the example route follows the specifications of international regulations for preventing collision at sea which require the vessel using the traffic separation scheme shall proceed in the appropriate traffic lane in the general direction of traffic flow for that lane the main procedures of applying aco to automatic routing can be summarized as follows the parameter t means tour round index and k means ant index the parameter m is designated number of ants and tmax is the maximum limit of tour round 1 parameters initialization given the directed graph of turning node g tn l designate the amount of ants m and the maximum limit of tour round tmax initialize t 0 and k 0 τ ij 0 const 2 the amount of tour round t t 1 and the ant in this tour k k 1 3 the kth ant chooses and goes forward to the next turning node according to the probability calculated by equation 2 meantime the selected turning node is removed from the allowable table of the kth ant this procedure stops until the kth ant reaches the ending turning node on the premise that there does exist a path from the starting to the ending turning node 4 after all ants have reached the ending turning node the pheromone trail level between turning node will be updated according to the m ants tour and equation 3 5 the optimal path in the tth tour round is reserved 6 start a new tour round t t 1 and repeat procedures 2 3 4 and 5 7 after tmax tour rounds are finished the optimal path in all tour rounds are selected 4 conclusion this paper proposes a novel approach to automatic maritime routing from large collections of opportunistically collected ais trajectories this kind of trajectories is bound to be large scale coarse grained and disparate in coverage data driven based algorithms are used to infer maritime route in nutshell a simplification algorithm is used to compress the redundant information in the original trajectories to improve subsequent processing efficiency for which to deal with a large dataset then changes in the direction of simplified trajectory are exploited to identify turning points and to cluster them using dbscan algorithm according to spatial proximity and turn similarity to derive turning nodes after getting the linkage between turning nodes aco is used to find the optimal path from the starting turning node to the ending turning node in this paper we focus primarily on basic automatic maritime routing some parameters used in dbscan and aco were established empirically by running a series of experiments to tune the method to its optimal performance however averaging and approximation are used in the proposed automatic routing algorithm an overreliance on the automatic generated route increases navigation risks such as grounding the seafarers responsibility of route planning and route safety validation can t be exempted by using the automatic routing algorithm even though this paper has solved the basic problem of automatic maritime routing different enhanced aspects that take more relevant factors and more advanced criterion into consideration are still remaining to be settled such as dynamic weather routing minimizing time or fuel consumption routing dynamic routing according to colregs future research will be focused on this direction on the another hand data driven based automatic routing algorithm relies on enormous up to data ais trajectories potential risk of navigation safety will be increased if the trajectory data can t be updated timely for example supposed the traffic separation scheme of chengshantou sea area is changed by maritime authority vessels will follow the new scheme if the ais trajectories used in the algorithm proposed in this paper can t reflect this change potential collision risk is exist so the rationality and feasibility of the route generated automatically is needed to check acknowledgements this work
