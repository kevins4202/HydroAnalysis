2780,as complicated microcosms lakes have been attracting exponentially increasing attention resulting in plentiful interdisciplinary academic publications of more than 105 it is thereby challengeable to explore the massive unstructured text information of publications to understand lake topics from the global and centurial scale perspectives however conventional bibliometrics suffer from the limitations of non understanding the literature a novel approach natural language understanding based deep clustering nlu dc for large text clustering was proposed in this study for global meta analysis of evolution patterns for lake topics the validated nlu dc elevated the available keywords from 24 to 70 correcting the statistical bias in the traditional evidence synthesis its high performance derives from the integration of a deep learning model cosine distance dbscan clustering and changing hyperparameters this approach is of great accuracy and efficiency for large text datasets this study thereby identified the centurial scale topics related to lakes using large literature datasets covering 130 000 studies the results showed that the topics became more and more abundant but were concentrated stably towards central ones six evolution patterns consisting of fluctuating emerging in 1970 emerging after 1970 trending up stable and trending down patterns were identified with generalized linear model glm we found that in recent twenty years few emerging topics attract significant academic attention and the dependency between topics is catching more attention than before to prolong the lake studies it is essential to strengthen the integrated studies on multi pattern topics in particular over emerging and trending down topics our study verified that the nlu dc consisting of state of the art deep learning models in natural language processing and efficient clustering algorithm in machine learning is a powerful method for global meta analysis of water related research fields and have huge potential to be applied in all fields of academical studies keywords evolution pattern deep learning lake topics keywords clustering centurial scale data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lake is one of the most significant natural landscapes to provide biological habitat nutrient retention and various ecosystem services there are over 117 million lakes area 0 002 km2 in the world covering a total area of about 5 106 km2 and 3 7 of the earth s land area verpoorter et al 2014 lakes record the changes of the earth over the past centuries and their physical chemical and biological characteristics vary greatly each lake can be treated as a single hyper complicated microcosm with co existence and succession of inorganic elements and organic lives carpenter 1996 forbes 1925 funes et al 2016 since the 1900s continuous studies have been conducted for lakes globally especially after the 1970s under the influence of anthropogenic activities and climate change heusser 1974 lazerte and dillon 1984 ramberg 1979 wakeham et al 1980 lakes have been threatened unprecedentedly lake ecosystem degradation and eutrophication have become more and more serious hasler 1947 hudon et al 2014 ibelings et al 2007 krieger 1984 reid et al 2019 schindle 1971 which urges for interdisciplinary and multiple scale studies to explore the complex processes and their interactions the interdisciplinarity derives from the integration of mathematics statistics differential equations optimization machine learning etc physics atmosphere hydrology fluid dynamics etc chemistry inorganic and organic matter reactions etc and biology genes proteins growth etc multiple scales range a spatially from microscopic cells individuals and their relationships to macroscopic movement and global phenomenon and b temporally from the daily variation of nutrients to yearly vegetation growth and centennial climate change complex processes consist of diverse and nonlinear responses among nutrients and food webs due to the abundance of potential topics the knowledge database of lakes is becoming unexpectedly larger the total number of published articles has reached a magnitude of 105 and is growing at more than 104 per year hence when massive studies enrich our knowledge they also trigger new challenges how to exploit and explore the achievements of unstructured text information on topics methods or conclusions to avoid future studies falling the pitfall of partial or local knowledge area conventional bibliometrics is useful to overview the profile of the whole research field li and nan 2017 wang et al 2015 but its benefit lies in the incorporation of experts knowledge while limiting the number of the literature analyzed in the review process callaghan et al 2021 in addition the preceding bibliometrics methods will also increase the evaluation bias callaghan et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 with absence of understanding the semantic information of large literature like human being for example keyword analysis is believed to be the most valuable method to explore the evolution patterns for a large literature dataset since it will provide widely key information on the main topics methods and applications zhang et al 2015 but it is also the most difficult procedure when considering the ever changing phrases in both forms and semantics the previous analysis is based on the frequency of exactly the unprocessed keywords yi et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 evidence demonstrated that about 10 20 of total keywords were used in practice and most of them were ignored as a result of form changes fu et al 2010 li and nan 2017 to deal with form changes of keywords the classic natural language processing nlp techniques are used for single word based on rules of stemming and lemmatization however they are ineligible to adapt for phrases or long contexts where long range dependencies play a huge role and cannot identify the synonyms or learn unbiasedly the semantics similar words qiu et al 2020 it is therefore urgent to use novel approaches of keyword analysis to get more complete information recently natural language understanding nlu technique is essential to help handle with the academic text the nlu based text aggregation could be one of the most potent approaches to identifying the hidden similarity for large scale documents oliva et al 2021 renganathan 2017 transformer a state of the art deep learning model architecture was proposed as an ideal tool for nlu tasks vaswani et al 2017 with a stack of encoder and decoder layers transformer can understand literally long language from large volumes of text datasets like variant bert xlnet gpt and t5 devlin et al 2018 raffel et al 2019 yang et al 2019 yao et al 2017 meanwhile transformer keeps the advantages of transfer learning which allows us to reuse the knowledge learned from the one task to another task by adding a few specific layers and fine tuning on the small amount of dataset tan et al 2018 gordon et al 2020 it is thereby called a pre trained model and provides similar background or brilliant initialization for nlu tasks besides transformer depends entirely on multi head self attention to utilize the bidirectional context and compute in parallel and therefore outcompetes other transfer learning models using sequence aligned recurrent neural network rnn or convolutional neural network cnn therefore it can complete training tasks using a large number of unlabeled texts regardless of length of each text devlin et al 2018 these characteristics bring transformer success in multiple domains like biomedicine lee et al 2020 news gururangan et al 2020 finance yang and siy 2020 law leivaditi et al 2020 and academia beltagy et al 2019 the main purpose of this study is to develop a general text clustering method to explore the evolution patterns of lake topics with massive publications which will provide a better global understanding of the domains the data was collected from the web of science wos database all of the english article records related to lakes from 1900 to 2020 have complied we proposed a novel approach as natural language understanding based deep clustering nlu dc for the dimension reduction of large samples of keywords nlu dc is made up of rule based and semantics based preprocessing initial and deep clustering and postprocessing the centurial scale evolution patterns and relationships of topics in global lake studies were then identified what s more considering the interdisciplinarity of lake related studies the general efficient and automatic nlu dc is transferable to the evidence synthesis in other research fields of natural science e g physics chemistry biology and hydrology with minor background knowledge as well as lakes 2 methodology 2 1 data collection the raw metadata of lake related literature was retrieved from the wos database in may 2021 we designated lake as the theme word and restricted the research fields in agriculture environmental sciences ecology fisheries and forestry and others from 1900 to 2020 supporting materials text s1 mass information involved the publication types authors titles keywords journal names publishers institutions publication years research fields and cited times as a result we acquired 139 657 papers from over 3000 journals in the wos core collection fig 1 the top 5 journals with the largest number of articles are hydrobiologia 5881 journal of great lakes research 3041 science of the total environment 2663 canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 2494 and environmental science technology 2297 metadata was handled with keyword generation keyword splitting rule based and semantics based preprocessing initial and deep clustering and post processing fig 2 2 2 keyword generation and preprocessing keywords are the primary nouns or phrases closely related to the research topics methods and cases in the collections of raw data we designed a two step procedure to complement potential keywords a extracting nouns and adjective nouns phrases directly from titles of articles using python module pytextrank mihalcea and tarau 2004 and spacy montani et al 2021 and b processing and re extracting key items from the lengthy terminologies a minority of keywords were too long or with too many adjectives to be concise in semantics considering the bias in lengthy terminologies during processing the words with a length larger than l0 e g 6 and frequency less than f0 e g 10 were re extracted by pytextrank due to the fact that these words are compounds of two regular keywords the raw and massive keywords are hard to analyze due to the large variability in this study we proposed a novel natural language understanding based deep clustering nlu dc for the large samples of keywords it consisted of traditional rule based nlp techniques novel transformer and fast clustering algorithm dbscan we combined rule based and semantics based preprocessing to reduce the distinction and number of keywords 2 2 1 rule based preprocessing insufficient processing can underestimate or miscalculate the frequency of the variants and synonyms for the keywords to solve the linguistic problems we implemented a rule based preprocessing modified from zhu et al 2021 the key steps were listed as below a lemmatization it is one of the most widely used methods for text processing by removing affixes changing inflectional forms and returning the base or dictionary form of a word we chose lemmatization for its better performance in language modeling balakrishnan and ethel 2014 jivani 2011 the lemminflect a python module for english lemmatization was adopted in this study since it has the highest accuracy on the automatically generated inflection database agid among popular lemmatization tools including nltk spacy and stanford corenlp jascob 2021 b abbreviation conversion commonly the full name e g total nitrogen or its abbreviation e g tn will be regularly used as keyword dependents on authors preference therefore it will be substantially underestimated if ignoring this linguistic phenomenon to solve the problem we converted the abbreviations to their full names with the collected abbreviation inventory table s1 this inventory was constructed by matching abbreviations full name pairs from the abstracts of all articles with python module abbreviations only when the pair occurred 5 times zhu et al 2021 it was collected into the inventory c chemical formula conversion according to the chemical formulas and their corresponding names zhu et al 2021 different formats were recognized and converted to correctly separate the chemical formulas from the keywords a case insensitive regular expression was used to screen them out before the conversion for example fe was matched from phosphorus and fe or phosphorus and fe ii d removal of extraneous characters in this context extraneous characters refer to punctuation e g hyphen stop words e g and and redundant words e g lake and water fu et al 2010 punctuation was filtered by the python module spacy stop words were removed using nltk an advanced platform for nlp in particular lake and water are two of the most frequently mentioned words that every one knows to eliminate the disturbance of these words we manually annotated the possible redundant usages containing lake or water in the keywords and then carried out the removal for instance lake in lake sediment was removed while at lake level not e substitution of lake aliases some lakes have multiple aliases which are proper nouns and cannot be recognized by the methods mentioned above therefore we first extracted lake names from all abstracts with regular expressions supporting materials table s2 then google maps was utilized to locate all the lakes and if they were in a continuous lake area the two lake names were supposed to come from the same one and then joined together 2 2 2 semantics based preprocessing to quantify the similarity of keywords in semantics e g synonyms and paraphrases we used semantics based preprocessing to combine keywords with a strong resemblance namely sentence transformers it is a multilingual word sentence and paragraph embedding model based on deep learning reimers and gurevych 2019 it was utilized to transform the words into numerical vectors then dbscan schubert et al 2017 a density based clustering method was implemented to classify similar keywords with a lower hyperparameter eps dbscan has the advantages of no need for a priori specification of the number of clusters and the ability to identify noise samples during clustering the batch calculation was devised to reduce the excessive demand for memory we identified the keywords with the largest count of the corresponding cluster as the representatives 2 3 keyword clustering and postprocessing 2 3 1 initial clustering previous dimension reductions are insufficient owing to the large size of keywords we adopted the same method described in semantics based preprocessing to carry out the third reduction the difference was that the value of eps was larger to involve as many keywords as possible the unclassified keywords independent or separated keywords labeled as 1 were kept as a single cluster when eps decreased these keywords were still labeled as 1 by dbscan to be excluded from the next clustering 2 3 2 deep clustering both semantics based preprocessing with small eps and initial clustering with large eps were eligible to obtain desirable clusters whereas the former may ignore similar keywords with larger distances and the latter may gather too many keywords that are not similar enough we developed an adaptive clustering procedure named deep clustering with degressive eps to overcome the former contradiction and improve the accuracy of clustering the hyperparameter min samples of dbscan was set as 2 namely two similar keywords would be considered as a new cluster and this is rational in the keywords reduction task the eps decreased at an exponential rate parameterized by λ 1 i 0 λ i i 1 2 3 where i is eps value of the i th iteration and 0 is the initial values 0 25 λ is the attenuation coefficient of eps set as 0 8 in this study iterations would stop when all the clusters complied with the termination standards fig 2 described as below a the ratio of the stem of the word with the largest count to the cluster size r satisfies the condition r r 0 where r 0 is the preassigned threshold 0 8 implying that at least 80 words within one category share the same stem this stop rule prevents a true cluster from being divided into different parts when eps is too small b the size of a specific cluster n is less than the threshold n 0 n 0 5 in which case r becomes a feeble index to represent the rationality of clustering because of randomness c the label of keywords by dbscan is 1 which means the keywords are marked as a noise point d the number of un clustered keywords is zero the setups of 0 λ r 0 and n 0 had been tested by following validation methods and produced good performance in spite of this samples were likely to be clustered into undersize classes by the above procedures leading to an overrated number of clusters and neglecting the similarity of sub clusters to solve this problem a postprocessing method was designed to detect the most frequent stem for each cluster and to merge the sub clusters with the same stem in sum nlu dc assembled the rule based preprocessing semantics based preprocessing deep clustering and postprocessing to reduce the statistical bias of conventional bibliometric methods and provide integrated insights for literature reviews with the advantages of the state of the art natural languages understanding and machine learning nlu dc can represent text similarity in academicals fields regardless of the forms of words synonym and paraphrase for example the similarity of the term lake clarity and lake transparency is 83 calculated by nlu dc and that of the paraphrase phosphorus promotes the growth of algae and algae is affected by phosphorus is 89 these very similar texts had been clustered into the same categories not influenced by length of different texts further the efficient and automatic nlu dc involved little human effort so that it helped to cluster massive text datasets within hours we are thereby confident that it is transferable to literature reviews in other fields of academical studies 2 4 performance validation of nlu dc the algorithm nlu dc was validated by 500 manually labeled keywords supporting materials table s3 and assessed by two clustering evaluation indexes adjusted mutual information ami and homogeneity completeness hc ami is a statistical index in probability theory and information theory proposed recently for comparing clusters defined by 2 a m i u v m i u v e m i u v m e a n h u h v e m i u v where u and v are two clusters h u is the entropy of the cluster u m i u v is the mutual information between u and v e m i u v is the expected mutual information between u and v ami falls into a range of 0 to 1 where values near 0 indicate two largely independent label assignments while values close to 1 mean significant agreement vinh et al 2010 the hc is another index consisting of two values a homogeneity h to describe the degree that each cluster contains only samples of a class of ground truth and b completeness c to describe the degree that all samples of a class are labeled with the same cluster 3 h 1 h c k h c 4 c 1 h k c h k where h c k is the conditional entropy of the true classes given the clusters by algorithm and h c is the entropy of the classes rosenberg and hirschberg 2007 this statistic ranges from 0 for randomly distributed assignments to 1 for clusters that perform perfectly 2 5 evolution pattern of lake topics the temporal evolution trends of the topics can be better quantified using statistical models considering the limited number of articles published before 1970 fig 1 we set 1970 as the beginning year and the proportion of topics as the dependent variable to reflect academic attention because the proportion variable did not obey the normal distribution we employed the generalized linear model glm tisseuil et al 2010 to fit the response of top 1000 topics to time its formula was as follows 5 y k t i m e b where y was the annual proportion of topics k and b were the slope and intercept of glm respectively to reduce the random error we used summation of y at a 5 year interval the intercept b fitted by glm represented the initial attention of topics in the 1970s a significant positive value meant that the topic had been focused a significant negative value meant that the topic was not focused in 1970 but would be in the later period while the insignificant intercept meant that the topic was only occasionally focused in the 1970s the slope k fitted by glm represented the trend of topics a significant positive k represented an increasing trend a significant negative one represented a decreasing trend and an insignificant one indicated no trend hence according to the sign and significance of intercept and slope we divided the top 1000 topics into 6 patterns there are 9 types in theory but 3 types hardly exist namely a fluctuating pattern flp b 0 k 0 b emerging after 1970 pattern eap b 0 k 0 c emerging in 1970 pattern eip ee 0 k 0 d trending up pattern tup b 0 e 0 e stable pattern stp b 0 e 0 and f trending down pattern tdp b 0 k 0 3 results and discussions 3 1 great performance of nlu dc in keyword processing overall the nlu dc algorithm reduced the number of similar keywords from 277 k to 29 8 k by 89 supporting materials table s4 it indicates that just about 10 of the keywords can represent all the original population without losing important information in this study we regarded a cluster of keywords that were close in semantics as a topic to our knowledge it is the first time to quantitatively identify the comprehensive topics related to lakes using large literature datasets the three most popular topics were sediment carbon and phosphorus with a large count of 13 5 k 5 9 k and 5 4 k respectively supporting materials table s5 the total count of top 100 topics reached 217 k fig 3 compared with unprocessed keywords the cumulative count of top 100 topics through preprocessing deep clustering and post processing increased by 57 113 and 239 respectively in other words only 0 3 of keywords can represent 29 of the total count 750 k and 3 will possess 70 of the total count taking top 1000 keywords as statistical data the usage of keywords was elevated from 24 to 70 compared with unprocessed keywords fig 3 to test the performance of the clustering we developed a validation dataset containing 500 labeled keywords the index ami of test data is 0 66 which proved that the clustering s performance was significantly higher than random classification ami 0 vinh et al 2010 the index hc is 0 91 0 87 showing the intra cluster error was similar to that of the inter cluster it means that nlu dc has the comprehensive ability to cluster similar keywords and separate different keywords the proposed nlu dc has great performance for clustering a large number of keywords including preprocessing keyword embedding distance metrics and deep clustering in the beginning about 46 k by 32 of the articles lacked author keywords terms extracting typical words or phrases from titles can greatly enrich the keywords from 510 k to 750 k by 46 fig 4 a these added keywords mainly came from the nouns or noun phrases of the titles for example the keywords extracted from the title influence of methyl tert butyl ether on lake water algae are lake water algae methyl tert butyl ether and influence which was consistent with domain knowledge the new keywords involved the research fields elements methods or cases satisfying the basic principles of the author s arrangement for keywords keyword splitting reduced the word length and semantic complexity fig 4b for example the keyword nutrient distribution of lake erie sediment is a combination of keywords nutrient and sediment and it is 0 50 and 0 44 cosine distance away from nutrient and sediment respectively according to limnological knowledge this compound phrase is more likely to belong to topic sediment but it may be clustered into neither nutrient nor sediment due to large embedding distance keyword splitting tool pytextrank recommended the phrase lake erie sediment as the keyword and the modified distance with sediment decreased to 0 30 showing the ability of keyword splitting to extract useful information from lengthy words the results also revealed that the rule based preprocessing greatly promoted the unification of forms of keywords fig 4c the number of keywords was reduced from 277 k to 198 k by 28 a large number of keywords were changed from plural nouns to singular ones and the abbreviations were extended to complete phrases rule based preprocessing can lessen the distance of similar keywords and enlarge the distance of dissimilar keywords for example keywords tp and total phosphorus differ greatly in morphology and their cosine distance is 0 75 by converting the abbreviation they share the same form fig 4d showed that there are about 39 2 k keywords varying in their forms checked by python tool fuzzywuzzy that calculated the levenshtein distance of character strings mouselimis 2021 their forms were more uniform and the semantic changes were avoidable otherwise the semantics of about 15 7 k keywords would change significantly the referred distance threshold was 0 24 equal to eps of initial clustering in short rule based preprocessing is helpful to reduce the complexity caused by lexical forms and draw more attention to the meanings expressed by keywords semantics based preprocessing was then applied to combine the most similar semantic keywords fig 4e the method that quantified the semantic similarity was a transformer based deep learning model paraphrase mpnet base v2 reimers and gurevych 2019 for word embedding transforming words and sentences into 768 dimensions vectors supporting materials text s2 based on this model the distance between two similar keywords could be a small value this clustering reduced the keywords from 198 k to 187 k by 6 for example keywords cyanobacteria cyanobacterium and cyanobacterial implication were merged into one cluster and cyanobacteria was identified as the representative 3 2 optimal configurations for clustering similar keywords probably have large distances after embedding resulting from insufficient expression in corpus during training process to solve the problem the third reduction initial clustering was conducted to involve keywords as many as possible under a large eps we screened for independent keywords with significantly different semantics from other clusters under the constraint of stopping rules these separate keywords were directly poured into the list of clustering results to reduce the duplicate computational memory and running time in total 39 9 k 21 of keywords were labeled as independent keywords and 11 1 k groups were identified from the remaining keywords these keywords were temporarily clustered into the same groups but they may show great differences within groups the fourth reduction was completed by deep clustering layer by layer with changing eps for instance the dissimilar keywords phytoplankton and zooplankton will be within one group when eps 0 25 it seems to be unacceptable until they will be marked as different groups when changing eps is 0 1 as expected the deep clustering algorithm gathered keywords into 109 k clusters including 25 4 k groups and 83 5 k independent keywords regardless of independent keywords the average group size is about 3 the largest group is dominated by the keyword sediment which is related to 863 similar words including sedimentation sedimentology sediment core and bottom sediment the quality of word embedding of nlp models determines the performance of the clustering algorithm a variety of implementations and derivatives of transformer models have been developed and their differences come mainly from the training corpora and model structures subramanyam kalyan et al 2021 for example for the pre trained model stsb mpnet base v2 the benchmark corpus dataset stsb the semantic textual simulation benchmark cer et al 2017 on the glue general language understanding evaluation platform was used to train the transformer based model mpnet the corpus stsb comprises 8628 sentence pairs from image captions news headlines and user forums if the training corpus is more similar to the words of downstream tasks the pre trained model can make good use of embedding ability with full energy reimers and gurevych 2019 in addition the rationality of similarity distance also determines the performance of the algorithm but so far we found that the bibliometrics did not carry out text similarity analysis of scientific papers where vocabulary is greatly different from the usage in the daily life like stsb so the problems to be addressed in our study were a which combination of corpora and transformer models is more efficient to embed phrases in scientific papers and b which distance measurement method can quantify the similarity of word pairs more accurately we designed 72 scenarios and tested the performance of word embedding with manual datasets corpora of scenarios were stsb paraphrase nli the model structures were mpnet roberta distilroberta and tinybert the distance metrics were euclidean manhattan braycurtis canberra chebyshev seuclidean sqeuclidean and cosine distance supporting materials text s3 experiments showed that the embedding quality of different combinations of the training datasets model structures and distance metrics were homogeneous but discrepant supporting materials fig s1 on one hand the average distances of similar keywords were significantly lower than that of dissimilar keywords because the scatters were located on the left of the 1 1 line fig 5 a on the other hand not all metrics have equivalent discrimination ability firstly the difference between distances of similar keywords and dissimilar ones calculated by chebyshev distance was less than other metrics fig 5a so that chebyshev distance performed significantly worse secondly the various distances obtained by the pre trained model nli mpnet were slightly lower than those of other models fig 5b to enlarge the difference between the distances of similar and dissimilar keywords we preferred to adopt cosine euclidean or braycurtis distance as the metrics the mpnet model was recommended in this study based on stsb and paraphrase datasets cosine distance is not only a measurement of similarity but also an element of the distance matrix for the clustering algorithm undoubtedly a fraction of keywords are distinct from others so that they stand alone and cannot be assigned into any of the clusters therefore dbscan was deemed to be the best clustering algorithm instead of k means for general purposes with fast speed or mean shift with uneven cluster sizes or birch for large datasets andreopoulos et al 2009 benabdellah et al 2019 hassan et al 2021 algorithm optics and hdbscan were developed based on dbscan to solve the problem of the unbalanced density of data ankerst et al 1999 campello et al 2013 however optics only optimizes the eps but still cannot solve the problem of uneven density hdbscan can successfully combine the sub clusters under various eps while the distance of similar sub clusters may be too large fig 4e to be merged thoroughly in addition optics and hdbscan have high requirements for computational cost and memory benabdellah et al 2019 they are improper for clustering large datasets and high dimensional variables e g the space is about 200 000 768 in this study therefore we designed a novel deep clustering algorithm based on dbscan its hyperparameters are just the initial density distance 0 and attenuation coefficient of density λ the larger 0 means the fewer independent keywords in the clustering results and the higher memory and computational cost the larger λ represents the fewer independent keywords the more clusters the higher the intra cluster error and the higher memory and time cost despite the influence of 0 and λ we designed the post processing imitating the design of hdbscan to merge the sub clusters it is according to the frequency and stem of keywords because the similarity might be beyond the ability of embedding distance this can rearrange more sub clusters or independent keywords to improve accuracy and offset the impacts of 0 and λ so that they can be assigned more flexibly post processing reduced the number from 109 k to 29 8 k by 72 in which the separate keywords reduced from 83 5 k to 17 6 k by 79 and the count of aggregated groups reduced from 25 4 k to 12 2 k by 52 3 3 temporal evolution of lake related hot topics the previous meta analysis usually used only about 10 20 of keywords in keyword analysis fu et al 2010 li and nan 2017 jia et al 2020 while many keywords with very similar semantics were ignored which would lead to a strong statistical bias in this study nlp dc increased the proportion of top 100 keywords from 8 5 to 29 and the proportion of the top 1000 keywords from 24 to 70 it is extremely beneficial to identify the true evolution trend of hot topics the hot topics clustered keywords of 130 k articles on lakes were first identified clearly with nlu dc fig 6 a b their count increased exponentially from 1900 to 2020 leading by topic sediment chen et al 2020 chen and hur 2015 horppila 2019 typically the proportion of count of sediment increased rapidly to 0 03 in the 1970s then decreased and remained at the average value of 0 018 fig 6b on the contrary topic attention of climate change adrian et al 2009 woolway et al 2020 decreased in 1950 1970 then increased in 1970 2000 and remained at 0 01 since 2010 with the increasing number of published articles the proportion of topics fluctuated greatly before the 1970s decreased from 1970 to 2000 and tended to be stable after 2000 this finding is hard to be observed through the time series analysis of original keywords supporting materials fig s2 fig 6c showed that the topics became more and more diverse at the speed of exponential growth over the past seven decades however in terms of proportion with 1 the number of topics was keeping decreasing it reveals that the lake studies are more and more concentrated relatively on the other side the number of keywords 5 year count 5 within one topic increased with time fig 6d for example the topic of sediment had just 3 keywords count 5 in 1970 1975 but it increased to 79 in 2015 2020 indicating that the topic has been understood with more deep insights not only does a single topic have a distinguishable evolution curve but dependency or co occurrence of two or more topics can also present more interesting evolution trends it can also be more objective due to a quantitative search in the existing literature here taking topics of phytoplankton phosphorus p and nitrogen n as dependent topics we compared the relative importance of phosphorus and nitrogen to phytoplankton in general discussions liang et al 2020 paerl et al 2016 qin et al 2020 based on nlu dc it can conduct a more careful dependency analysis of keywords meanwhile the search span could be extended to abstract of articles for more potential co occurrence that may not exist in keywords as a result the specific keywords of p which co occurred with phytoplankton were phosphorus phosphate nitrogen and phosphorus soluble reactive phosphorus and phosphorus loading and the keywords of n were nitrogen nitrate nitrite inorganic nitrogen denitrification organic nitrogen and nitrogen limitation fig 7 a the number of articles in which phytoplankton only co occurred with p was twice that only co occurred with n and almost 1 3 of articles focusing on both n and p with phytoplankton for temporal trend both of the co occurrence frequencies of the p phytoplankton pair and the n phytoplankton pair have been rising since the 1990 s fig 7b however the annual proportion of the n phytoplankton pair increased compared with the p phytoplankton pair fig 7c demonstrating the relationships between nitrogen and phytoplankton are catching more research interest heisler et al 2008 sinha et al 2017 sutton et al 2011 3 4 identification of evolution patterns to better understand the trend changes we proposed a conceptual evolution curve which is similar to population growth in the biological life cycle eberhardt et al 2008 six patterns were identified by glm as snippets from the curve first in the early stage of life cycle fluctuating topics like anorthite evaluation siberia acipenser and atlantic are changing disorderly with small attention fig 8 a towards the right topics invasive species biodiversity taihu ribosomal rna modis and tibetan plateau emerged from 1970 to 2000 chen et al 1999 cohen et al 1993 li and yang 1995 may and marsden 1992 climate change holocene stable isotope cyanobacteria and wetland emerged in 1970 ludden et al 1983 ritchie 1969 stewart 1975 with large growth speed fig 8b c they were rising fast in short term periods likely linking with the current global focus of climate change and biodiversity next continuous increasing topics with the most growth speed fig 8d supporting materials fig s3 such as carbon water quality river model new species pollen and aquatic plant are medium term hot spots on the carbon cycle pennak 1963 related to aquatic plants misra 1938 terriere et al 1966 climate redway 1924 steenbergen and verdouw 1982 and numerical models csanady 1968 fee 1973 liston and hall 1995 then stable topics e g fish eutrophication nitrogen diatom and mercury kept a balanced scale from 1970 to 2020 korthals and winfrey 1987 oliver and nicol 1982 schelske et al 1986 fig 8e at the end of the curve the number of studies on topics sediment phosphorus phytoplankton great lake distribution and zooplankton was highest brunberg and bostrom 1992 jasser 1995 jorgensen 1995 but they are inclined to a relative decreasing trend fig 8f besides topics polychlorinated biphenyls daphnia and united states america have experienced two or more patterns that cannot be detected with glm supporting materials fig s4 interestingly 308 31 topics were formed before 1970 of which 102 topics had an upward trend and 206 topics had a downward trend in comparison 188 19 topics emerged around 1970 revealing that the 1970s was the peak time of emerging topics lemoalle et al 2012 stockwell et al 2009 more unexpectedly only 37 4 topics appeared after the 1970s and most of them were proposed before 2000 few improvements have expanded researches in the field of the lake in 2000 2020 it may imply that there have been few brand new topics on lakes in the past 20 years considering the emerging interdisciplinary studies in the past decades for the whole scientific community there is therefore a great need for interdisciplinary research to explore the complex interactions between the lake and the natural and anthropogenic pressures the relative attention of many topics was gradually declining and their growth speed has slowed down especially for the topics of tdp the challenge is how to push these evolution curves forward and make the systematic research of lakes more dynamic we found that a potential way is to strengthen the coupled researches between emerging and trending down topics fig 9 a showed the complex co occurrence of top 60 topics topic pairs phosphorus sediment metal sediment carbon sediment nitrogen phosphorus eutrophication phosphorus climate change holocene holocene pollen and phytoplankton zooplankton were the most popular co occurrence benito et al 2015 chen et al 2018 hampton et al 2017 rajeshkumar et al 2018 schindler 2012 these pairs mainly came from the types of tdp stp tup and eip in particular tdp correlated strongly with eip for instance sediment co occurred with climate change and holocene fig 9b yet topics of eap such as invasive species biodiversity taihu ribosomal rna and modis showed inadequate co occurrence with popular topics like sediment phytoplankton food web but their dependency has been proved with point to point lake studies rajeshkumar et al 2018 turner et al 2015 wagner et al 2012 if possible promoting the integration of eap and tdp could not only accelerate the emerging topics with advanced methods of large trending down topics but also keep longer attention on trending down topics some suggestions can be drawn from the above analysis including a paying more attention to topics of eap such as invasive species biodiversity ribosomal rna taihu tibetan plateau and permafrost b intensifying the integration of topics of tdp and eap for example sediment should be analyzed on the tibetan plateau for unclear holocene climatic changes chen et al 2016 or remote sensing like modis is used for long term daily scale changes of phytoplankton or carbon duan et al 2017 not just periods of algal blooms tan et al 2017 the interdisciplinary studies of lakes mainly derived from the combination of classic lake topics and interdisciplinary methods we found before 1980s the studies related to lakes were to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of environmental factors phytoplankton and fish and corresponding mechanism process by sampling which was the main concern of traditional limnology except for the mechanism model characterized by mathematical equations and solvers interdisciplinary methods were rarely used then studies had paid more attention to the relationship and effects between variables and more and more complex mechanism models had been developed and applied benefiting from the boost in computer science the stable isotope methods for paleoclimatology had grown rapidly and expanded to hydrology sediment and ecology around 2000 remote sensing began to be introduced to the study of lake transparency water temperature and vegetation and early machine learning algorithms were used to predict the state of lakes since 2010 in addition to the extensive use of remote sensing stable isotope and mechanism models deep learning has also been applied to increase the estimation accuracy of water area chlorophyll and water quality dna and rna techniques are applied to detect the complicated dynamics of aquatic microbes geophysical chemical and biological methods have been more integrated and keeps a growing trend the nlu dc consists of state of the art deep learning models in natural language processing and efficient clustering algorithm in machine learning it is a general tool for clustering the text of any research field as well as lakes given the high performance of keyword clustering the ability to involve millions of studies and the availability on ordinary computers nlu dc was strongly recommended as a powerful approach to literature reviews in this study we retrieved 130 k articles from wos and the results were cogent despite some unavoidable bias these interesting conclusions presented a better global quantitative understanding of the domain identified the weak points and proposed suggestions for future improvement 4 conclusions a novel large text clustering algorithm nlu dc was proposed in this study for the identification of evolution patterns for lake topics over a centurial scale our study verified that the nlu dc is a very powerful method for global meta analysis of water related research fields the main conclusions are a the validated nlu dc algorithm reduced the keywords from 277 k to 29 8 k by 89 compared with unprocessed keywords the total count of top 100 topics increased by 239 b the high performance of nlu dc derives from a deep learning model cosine distance dbscan clustering and changing hyperparameters the evolution curve of hot topics of over 130 k articles on lakes was identified c topics on lakes became more and more abundant at the speed of exponential growth but were concentrated towards central points the dependency between topics particularly the relationship of nitrogen and phytoplankton is catching more attention than before d six evolution patterns as snippets from the evolution curve were identified with glm in recent twenty years few emerging topics attract significant academic attention strengthening the integration of emerging and trending down topics could not only accelerate studies on the emerging topics but also keep attention on trending down topics overall the high performance of nlu dc and its ability to involve millions of studies make it transferable to knowledge understanding and literature reviews in other fields of academical studies further the next paradigm of literature reviews will overcome the challenges of extracting target information by coupling

2780,as complicated microcosms lakes have been attracting exponentially increasing attention resulting in plentiful interdisciplinary academic publications of more than 105 it is thereby challengeable to explore the massive unstructured text information of publications to understand lake topics from the global and centurial scale perspectives however conventional bibliometrics suffer from the limitations of non understanding the literature a novel approach natural language understanding based deep clustering nlu dc for large text clustering was proposed in this study for global meta analysis of evolution patterns for lake topics the validated nlu dc elevated the available keywords from 24 to 70 correcting the statistical bias in the traditional evidence synthesis its high performance derives from the integration of a deep learning model cosine distance dbscan clustering and changing hyperparameters this approach is of great accuracy and efficiency for large text datasets this study thereby identified the centurial scale topics related to lakes using large literature datasets covering 130 000 studies the results showed that the topics became more and more abundant but were concentrated stably towards central ones six evolution patterns consisting of fluctuating emerging in 1970 emerging after 1970 trending up stable and trending down patterns were identified with generalized linear model glm we found that in recent twenty years few emerging topics attract significant academic attention and the dependency between topics is catching more attention than before to prolong the lake studies it is essential to strengthen the integrated studies on multi pattern topics in particular over emerging and trending down topics our study verified that the nlu dc consisting of state of the art deep learning models in natural language processing and efficient clustering algorithm in machine learning is a powerful method for global meta analysis of water related research fields and have huge potential to be applied in all fields of academical studies keywords evolution pattern deep learning lake topics keywords clustering centurial scale data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lake is one of the most significant natural landscapes to provide biological habitat nutrient retention and various ecosystem services there are over 117 million lakes area 0 002 km2 in the world covering a total area of about 5 106 km2 and 3 7 of the earth s land area verpoorter et al 2014 lakes record the changes of the earth over the past centuries and their physical chemical and biological characteristics vary greatly each lake can be treated as a single hyper complicated microcosm with co existence and succession of inorganic elements and organic lives carpenter 1996 forbes 1925 funes et al 2016 since the 1900s continuous studies have been conducted for lakes globally especially after the 1970s under the influence of anthropogenic activities and climate change heusser 1974 lazerte and dillon 1984 ramberg 1979 wakeham et al 1980 lakes have been threatened unprecedentedly lake ecosystem degradation and eutrophication have become more and more serious hasler 1947 hudon et al 2014 ibelings et al 2007 krieger 1984 reid et al 2019 schindle 1971 which urges for interdisciplinary and multiple scale studies to explore the complex processes and their interactions the interdisciplinarity derives from the integration of mathematics statistics differential equations optimization machine learning etc physics atmosphere hydrology fluid dynamics etc chemistry inorganic and organic matter reactions etc and biology genes proteins growth etc multiple scales range a spatially from microscopic cells individuals and their relationships to macroscopic movement and global phenomenon and b temporally from the daily variation of nutrients to yearly vegetation growth and centennial climate change complex processes consist of diverse and nonlinear responses among nutrients and food webs due to the abundance of potential topics the knowledge database of lakes is becoming unexpectedly larger the total number of published articles has reached a magnitude of 105 and is growing at more than 104 per year hence when massive studies enrich our knowledge they also trigger new challenges how to exploit and explore the achievements of unstructured text information on topics methods or conclusions to avoid future studies falling the pitfall of partial or local knowledge area conventional bibliometrics is useful to overview the profile of the whole research field li and nan 2017 wang et al 2015 but its benefit lies in the incorporation of experts knowledge while limiting the number of the literature analyzed in the review process callaghan et al 2021 in addition the preceding bibliometrics methods will also increase the evaluation bias callaghan et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 with absence of understanding the semantic information of large literature like human being for example keyword analysis is believed to be the most valuable method to explore the evolution patterns for a large literature dataset since it will provide widely key information on the main topics methods and applications zhang et al 2015 but it is also the most difficult procedure when considering the ever changing phrases in both forms and semantics the previous analysis is based on the frequency of exactly the unprocessed keywords yi et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 evidence demonstrated that about 10 20 of total keywords were used in practice and most of them were ignored as a result of form changes fu et al 2010 li and nan 2017 to deal with form changes of keywords the classic natural language processing nlp techniques are used for single word based on rules of stemming and lemmatization however they are ineligible to adapt for phrases or long contexts where long range dependencies play a huge role and cannot identify the synonyms or learn unbiasedly the semantics similar words qiu et al 2020 it is therefore urgent to use novel approaches of keyword analysis to get more complete information recently natural language understanding nlu technique is essential to help handle with the academic text the nlu based text aggregation could be one of the most potent approaches to identifying the hidden similarity for large scale documents oliva et al 2021 renganathan 2017 transformer a state of the art deep learning model architecture was proposed as an ideal tool for nlu tasks vaswani et al 2017 with a stack of encoder and decoder layers transformer can understand literally long language from large volumes of text datasets like variant bert xlnet gpt and t5 devlin et al 2018 raffel et al 2019 yang et al 2019 yao et al 2017 meanwhile transformer keeps the advantages of transfer learning which allows us to reuse the knowledge learned from the one task to another task by adding a few specific layers and fine tuning on the small amount of dataset tan et al 2018 gordon et al 2020 it is thereby called a pre trained model and provides similar background or brilliant initialization for nlu tasks besides transformer depends entirely on multi head self attention to utilize the bidirectional context and compute in parallel and therefore outcompetes other transfer learning models using sequence aligned recurrent neural network rnn or convolutional neural network cnn therefore it can complete training tasks using a large number of unlabeled texts regardless of length of each text devlin et al 2018 these characteristics bring transformer success in multiple domains like biomedicine lee et al 2020 news gururangan et al 2020 finance yang and siy 2020 law leivaditi et al 2020 and academia beltagy et al 2019 the main purpose of this study is to develop a general text clustering method to explore the evolution patterns of lake topics with massive publications which will provide a better global understanding of the domains the data was collected from the web of science wos database all of the english article records related to lakes from 1900 to 2020 have complied we proposed a novel approach as natural language understanding based deep clustering nlu dc for the dimension reduction of large samples of keywords nlu dc is made up of rule based and semantics based preprocessing initial and deep clustering and postprocessing the centurial scale evolution patterns and relationships of topics in global lake studies were then identified what s more considering the interdisciplinarity of lake related studies the general efficient and automatic nlu dc is transferable to the evidence synthesis in other research fields of natural science e g physics chemistry biology and hydrology with minor background knowledge as well as lakes 2 methodology 2 1 data collection the raw metadata of lake related literature was retrieved from the wos database in may 2021 we designated lake as the theme word and restricted the research fields in agriculture environmental sciences ecology fisheries and forestry and others from 1900 to 2020 supporting materials text s1 mass information involved the publication types authors titles keywords journal names publishers institutions publication years research fields and cited times as a result we acquired 139 657 papers from over 3000 journals in the wos core collection fig 1 the top 5 journals with the largest number of articles are hydrobiologia 5881 journal of great lakes research 3041 science of the total environment 2663 canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences 2494 and environmental science technology 2297 metadata was handled with keyword generation keyword splitting rule based and semantics based preprocessing initial and deep clustering and post processing fig 2 2 2 keyword generation and preprocessing keywords are the primary nouns or phrases closely related to the research topics methods and cases in the collections of raw data we designed a two step procedure to complement potential keywords a extracting nouns and adjective nouns phrases directly from titles of articles using python module pytextrank mihalcea and tarau 2004 and spacy montani et al 2021 and b processing and re extracting key items from the lengthy terminologies a minority of keywords were too long or with too many adjectives to be concise in semantics considering the bias in lengthy terminologies during processing the words with a length larger than l0 e g 6 and frequency less than f0 e g 10 were re extracted by pytextrank due to the fact that these words are compounds of two regular keywords the raw and massive keywords are hard to analyze due to the large variability in this study we proposed a novel natural language understanding based deep clustering nlu dc for the large samples of keywords it consisted of traditional rule based nlp techniques novel transformer and fast clustering algorithm dbscan we combined rule based and semantics based preprocessing to reduce the distinction and number of keywords 2 2 1 rule based preprocessing insufficient processing can underestimate or miscalculate the frequency of the variants and synonyms for the keywords to solve the linguistic problems we implemented a rule based preprocessing modified from zhu et al 2021 the key steps were listed as below a lemmatization it is one of the most widely used methods for text processing by removing affixes changing inflectional forms and returning the base or dictionary form of a word we chose lemmatization for its better performance in language modeling balakrishnan and ethel 2014 jivani 2011 the lemminflect a python module for english lemmatization was adopted in this study since it has the highest accuracy on the automatically generated inflection database agid among popular lemmatization tools including nltk spacy and stanford corenlp jascob 2021 b abbreviation conversion commonly the full name e g total nitrogen or its abbreviation e g tn will be regularly used as keyword dependents on authors preference therefore it will be substantially underestimated if ignoring this linguistic phenomenon to solve the problem we converted the abbreviations to their full names with the collected abbreviation inventory table s1 this inventory was constructed by matching abbreviations full name pairs from the abstracts of all articles with python module abbreviations only when the pair occurred 5 times zhu et al 2021 it was collected into the inventory c chemical formula conversion according to the chemical formulas and their corresponding names zhu et al 2021 different formats were recognized and converted to correctly separate the chemical formulas from the keywords a case insensitive regular expression was used to screen them out before the conversion for example fe was matched from phosphorus and fe or phosphorus and fe ii d removal of extraneous characters in this context extraneous characters refer to punctuation e g hyphen stop words e g and and redundant words e g lake and water fu et al 2010 punctuation was filtered by the python module spacy stop words were removed using nltk an advanced platform for nlp in particular lake and water are two of the most frequently mentioned words that every one knows to eliminate the disturbance of these words we manually annotated the possible redundant usages containing lake or water in the keywords and then carried out the removal for instance lake in lake sediment was removed while at lake level not e substitution of lake aliases some lakes have multiple aliases which are proper nouns and cannot be recognized by the methods mentioned above therefore we first extracted lake names from all abstracts with regular expressions supporting materials table s2 then google maps was utilized to locate all the lakes and if they were in a continuous lake area the two lake names were supposed to come from the same one and then joined together 2 2 2 semantics based preprocessing to quantify the similarity of keywords in semantics e g synonyms and paraphrases we used semantics based preprocessing to combine keywords with a strong resemblance namely sentence transformers it is a multilingual word sentence and paragraph embedding model based on deep learning reimers and gurevych 2019 it was utilized to transform the words into numerical vectors then dbscan schubert et al 2017 a density based clustering method was implemented to classify similar keywords with a lower hyperparameter eps dbscan has the advantages of no need for a priori specification of the number of clusters and the ability to identify noise samples during clustering the batch calculation was devised to reduce the excessive demand for memory we identified the keywords with the largest count of the corresponding cluster as the representatives 2 3 keyword clustering and postprocessing 2 3 1 initial clustering previous dimension reductions are insufficient owing to the large size of keywords we adopted the same method described in semantics based preprocessing to carry out the third reduction the difference was that the value of eps was larger to involve as many keywords as possible the unclassified keywords independent or separated keywords labeled as 1 were kept as a single cluster when eps decreased these keywords were still labeled as 1 by dbscan to be excluded from the next clustering 2 3 2 deep clustering both semantics based preprocessing with small eps and initial clustering with large eps were eligible to obtain desirable clusters whereas the former may ignore similar keywords with larger distances and the latter may gather too many keywords that are not similar enough we developed an adaptive clustering procedure named deep clustering with degressive eps to overcome the former contradiction and improve the accuracy of clustering the hyperparameter min samples of dbscan was set as 2 namely two similar keywords would be considered as a new cluster and this is rational in the keywords reduction task the eps decreased at an exponential rate parameterized by λ 1 i 0 λ i i 1 2 3 where i is eps value of the i th iteration and 0 is the initial values 0 25 λ is the attenuation coefficient of eps set as 0 8 in this study iterations would stop when all the clusters complied with the termination standards fig 2 described as below a the ratio of the stem of the word with the largest count to the cluster size r satisfies the condition r r 0 where r 0 is the preassigned threshold 0 8 implying that at least 80 words within one category share the same stem this stop rule prevents a true cluster from being divided into different parts when eps is too small b the size of a specific cluster n is less than the threshold n 0 n 0 5 in which case r becomes a feeble index to represent the rationality of clustering because of randomness c the label of keywords by dbscan is 1 which means the keywords are marked as a noise point d the number of un clustered keywords is zero the setups of 0 λ r 0 and n 0 had been tested by following validation methods and produced good performance in spite of this samples were likely to be clustered into undersize classes by the above procedures leading to an overrated number of clusters and neglecting the similarity of sub clusters to solve this problem a postprocessing method was designed to detect the most frequent stem for each cluster and to merge the sub clusters with the same stem in sum nlu dc assembled the rule based preprocessing semantics based preprocessing deep clustering and postprocessing to reduce the statistical bias of conventional bibliometric methods and provide integrated insights for literature reviews with the advantages of the state of the art natural languages understanding and machine learning nlu dc can represent text similarity in academicals fields regardless of the forms of words synonym and paraphrase for example the similarity of the term lake clarity and lake transparency is 83 calculated by nlu dc and that of the paraphrase phosphorus promotes the growth of algae and algae is affected by phosphorus is 89 these very similar texts had been clustered into the same categories not influenced by length of different texts further the efficient and automatic nlu dc involved little human effort so that it helped to cluster massive text datasets within hours we are thereby confident that it is transferable to literature reviews in other fields of academical studies 2 4 performance validation of nlu dc the algorithm nlu dc was validated by 500 manually labeled keywords supporting materials table s3 and assessed by two clustering evaluation indexes adjusted mutual information ami and homogeneity completeness hc ami is a statistical index in probability theory and information theory proposed recently for comparing clusters defined by 2 a m i u v m i u v e m i u v m e a n h u h v e m i u v where u and v are two clusters h u is the entropy of the cluster u m i u v is the mutual information between u and v e m i u v is the expected mutual information between u and v ami falls into a range of 0 to 1 where values near 0 indicate two largely independent label assignments while values close to 1 mean significant agreement vinh et al 2010 the hc is another index consisting of two values a homogeneity h to describe the degree that each cluster contains only samples of a class of ground truth and b completeness c to describe the degree that all samples of a class are labeled with the same cluster 3 h 1 h c k h c 4 c 1 h k c h k where h c k is the conditional entropy of the true classes given the clusters by algorithm and h c is the entropy of the classes rosenberg and hirschberg 2007 this statistic ranges from 0 for randomly distributed assignments to 1 for clusters that perform perfectly 2 5 evolution pattern of lake topics the temporal evolution trends of the topics can be better quantified using statistical models considering the limited number of articles published before 1970 fig 1 we set 1970 as the beginning year and the proportion of topics as the dependent variable to reflect academic attention because the proportion variable did not obey the normal distribution we employed the generalized linear model glm tisseuil et al 2010 to fit the response of top 1000 topics to time its formula was as follows 5 y k t i m e b where y was the annual proportion of topics k and b were the slope and intercept of glm respectively to reduce the random error we used summation of y at a 5 year interval the intercept b fitted by glm represented the initial attention of topics in the 1970s a significant positive value meant that the topic had been focused a significant negative value meant that the topic was not focused in 1970 but would be in the later period while the insignificant intercept meant that the topic was only occasionally focused in the 1970s the slope k fitted by glm represented the trend of topics a significant positive k represented an increasing trend a significant negative one represented a decreasing trend and an insignificant one indicated no trend hence according to the sign and significance of intercept and slope we divided the top 1000 topics into 6 patterns there are 9 types in theory but 3 types hardly exist namely a fluctuating pattern flp b 0 k 0 b emerging after 1970 pattern eap b 0 k 0 c emerging in 1970 pattern eip ee 0 k 0 d trending up pattern tup b 0 e 0 e stable pattern stp b 0 e 0 and f trending down pattern tdp b 0 k 0 3 results and discussions 3 1 great performance of nlu dc in keyword processing overall the nlu dc algorithm reduced the number of similar keywords from 277 k to 29 8 k by 89 supporting materials table s4 it indicates that just about 10 of the keywords can represent all the original population without losing important information in this study we regarded a cluster of keywords that were close in semantics as a topic to our knowledge it is the first time to quantitatively identify the comprehensive topics related to lakes using large literature datasets the three most popular topics were sediment carbon and phosphorus with a large count of 13 5 k 5 9 k and 5 4 k respectively supporting materials table s5 the total count of top 100 topics reached 217 k fig 3 compared with unprocessed keywords the cumulative count of top 100 topics through preprocessing deep clustering and post processing increased by 57 113 and 239 respectively in other words only 0 3 of keywords can represent 29 of the total count 750 k and 3 will possess 70 of the total count taking top 1000 keywords as statistical data the usage of keywords was elevated from 24 to 70 compared with unprocessed keywords fig 3 to test the performance of the clustering we developed a validation dataset containing 500 labeled keywords the index ami of test data is 0 66 which proved that the clustering s performance was significantly higher than random classification ami 0 vinh et al 2010 the index hc is 0 91 0 87 showing the intra cluster error was similar to that of the inter cluster it means that nlu dc has the comprehensive ability to cluster similar keywords and separate different keywords the proposed nlu dc has great performance for clustering a large number of keywords including preprocessing keyword embedding distance metrics and deep clustering in the beginning about 46 k by 32 of the articles lacked author keywords terms extracting typical words or phrases from titles can greatly enrich the keywords from 510 k to 750 k by 46 fig 4 a these added keywords mainly came from the nouns or noun phrases of the titles for example the keywords extracted from the title influence of methyl tert butyl ether on lake water algae are lake water algae methyl tert butyl ether and influence which was consistent with domain knowledge the new keywords involved the research fields elements methods or cases satisfying the basic principles of the author s arrangement for keywords keyword splitting reduced the word length and semantic complexity fig 4b for example the keyword nutrient distribution of lake erie sediment is a combination of keywords nutrient and sediment and it is 0 50 and 0 44 cosine distance away from nutrient and sediment respectively according to limnological knowledge this compound phrase is more likely to belong to topic sediment but it may be clustered into neither nutrient nor sediment due to large embedding distance keyword splitting tool pytextrank recommended the phrase lake erie sediment as the keyword and the modified distance with sediment decreased to 0 30 showing the ability of keyword splitting to extract useful information from lengthy words the results also revealed that the rule based preprocessing greatly promoted the unification of forms of keywords fig 4c the number of keywords was reduced from 277 k to 198 k by 28 a large number of keywords were changed from plural nouns to singular ones and the abbreviations were extended to complete phrases rule based preprocessing can lessen the distance of similar keywords and enlarge the distance of dissimilar keywords for example keywords tp and total phosphorus differ greatly in morphology and their cosine distance is 0 75 by converting the abbreviation they share the same form fig 4d showed that there are about 39 2 k keywords varying in their forms checked by python tool fuzzywuzzy that calculated the levenshtein distance of character strings mouselimis 2021 their forms were more uniform and the semantic changes were avoidable otherwise the semantics of about 15 7 k keywords would change significantly the referred distance threshold was 0 24 equal to eps of initial clustering in short rule based preprocessing is helpful to reduce the complexity caused by lexical forms and draw more attention to the meanings expressed by keywords semantics based preprocessing was then applied to combine the most similar semantic keywords fig 4e the method that quantified the semantic similarity was a transformer based deep learning model paraphrase mpnet base v2 reimers and gurevych 2019 for word embedding transforming words and sentences into 768 dimensions vectors supporting materials text s2 based on this model the distance between two similar keywords could be a small value this clustering reduced the keywords from 198 k to 187 k by 6 for example keywords cyanobacteria cyanobacterium and cyanobacterial implication were merged into one cluster and cyanobacteria was identified as the representative 3 2 optimal configurations for clustering similar keywords probably have large distances after embedding resulting from insufficient expression in corpus during training process to solve the problem the third reduction initial clustering was conducted to involve keywords as many as possible under a large eps we screened for independent keywords with significantly different semantics from other clusters under the constraint of stopping rules these separate keywords were directly poured into the list of clustering results to reduce the duplicate computational memory and running time in total 39 9 k 21 of keywords were labeled as independent keywords and 11 1 k groups were identified from the remaining keywords these keywords were temporarily clustered into the same groups but they may show great differences within groups the fourth reduction was completed by deep clustering layer by layer with changing eps for instance the dissimilar keywords phytoplankton and zooplankton will be within one group when eps 0 25 it seems to be unacceptable until they will be marked as different groups when changing eps is 0 1 as expected the deep clustering algorithm gathered keywords into 109 k clusters including 25 4 k groups and 83 5 k independent keywords regardless of independent keywords the average group size is about 3 the largest group is dominated by the keyword sediment which is related to 863 similar words including sedimentation sedimentology sediment core and bottom sediment the quality of word embedding of nlp models determines the performance of the clustering algorithm a variety of implementations and derivatives of transformer models have been developed and their differences come mainly from the training corpora and model structures subramanyam kalyan et al 2021 for example for the pre trained model stsb mpnet base v2 the benchmark corpus dataset stsb the semantic textual simulation benchmark cer et al 2017 on the glue general language understanding evaluation platform was used to train the transformer based model mpnet the corpus stsb comprises 8628 sentence pairs from image captions news headlines and user forums if the training corpus is more similar to the words of downstream tasks the pre trained model can make good use of embedding ability with full energy reimers and gurevych 2019 in addition the rationality of similarity distance also determines the performance of the algorithm but so far we found that the bibliometrics did not carry out text similarity analysis of scientific papers where vocabulary is greatly different from the usage in the daily life like stsb so the problems to be addressed in our study were a which combination of corpora and transformer models is more efficient to embed phrases in scientific papers and b which distance measurement method can quantify the similarity of word pairs more accurately we designed 72 scenarios and tested the performance of word embedding with manual datasets corpora of scenarios were stsb paraphrase nli the model structures were mpnet roberta distilroberta and tinybert the distance metrics were euclidean manhattan braycurtis canberra chebyshev seuclidean sqeuclidean and cosine distance supporting materials text s3 experiments showed that the embedding quality of different combinations of the training datasets model structures and distance metrics were homogeneous but discrepant supporting materials fig s1 on one hand the average distances of similar keywords were significantly lower than that of dissimilar keywords because the scatters were located on the left of the 1 1 line fig 5 a on the other hand not all metrics have equivalent discrimination ability firstly the difference between distances of similar keywords and dissimilar ones calculated by chebyshev distance was less than other metrics fig 5a so that chebyshev distance performed significantly worse secondly the various distances obtained by the pre trained model nli mpnet were slightly lower than those of other models fig 5b to enlarge the difference between the distances of similar and dissimilar keywords we preferred to adopt cosine euclidean or braycurtis distance as the metrics the mpnet model was recommended in this study based on stsb and paraphrase datasets cosine distance is not only a measurement of similarity but also an element of the distance matrix for the clustering algorithm undoubtedly a fraction of keywords are distinct from others so that they stand alone and cannot be assigned into any of the clusters therefore dbscan was deemed to be the best clustering algorithm instead of k means for general purposes with fast speed or mean shift with uneven cluster sizes or birch for large datasets andreopoulos et al 2009 benabdellah et al 2019 hassan et al 2021 algorithm optics and hdbscan were developed based on dbscan to solve the problem of the unbalanced density of data ankerst et al 1999 campello et al 2013 however optics only optimizes the eps but still cannot solve the problem of uneven density hdbscan can successfully combine the sub clusters under various eps while the distance of similar sub clusters may be too large fig 4e to be merged thoroughly in addition optics and hdbscan have high requirements for computational cost and memory benabdellah et al 2019 they are improper for clustering large datasets and high dimensional variables e g the space is about 200 000 768 in this study therefore we designed a novel deep clustering algorithm based on dbscan its hyperparameters are just the initial density distance 0 and attenuation coefficient of density λ the larger 0 means the fewer independent keywords in the clustering results and the higher memory and computational cost the larger λ represents the fewer independent keywords the more clusters the higher the intra cluster error and the higher memory and time cost despite the influence of 0 and λ we designed the post processing imitating the design of hdbscan to merge the sub clusters it is according to the frequency and stem of keywords because the similarity might be beyond the ability of embedding distance this can rearrange more sub clusters or independent keywords to improve accuracy and offset the impacts of 0 and λ so that they can be assigned more flexibly post processing reduced the number from 109 k to 29 8 k by 72 in which the separate keywords reduced from 83 5 k to 17 6 k by 79 and the count of aggregated groups reduced from 25 4 k to 12 2 k by 52 3 3 temporal evolution of lake related hot topics the previous meta analysis usually used only about 10 20 of keywords in keyword analysis fu et al 2010 li and nan 2017 jia et al 2020 while many keywords with very similar semantics were ignored which would lead to a strong statistical bias in this study nlp dc increased the proportion of top 100 keywords from 8 5 to 29 and the proportion of the top 1000 keywords from 24 to 70 it is extremely beneficial to identify the true evolution trend of hot topics the hot topics clustered keywords of 130 k articles on lakes were first identified clearly with nlu dc fig 6 a b their count increased exponentially from 1900 to 2020 leading by topic sediment chen et al 2020 chen and hur 2015 horppila 2019 typically the proportion of count of sediment increased rapidly to 0 03 in the 1970s then decreased and remained at the average value of 0 018 fig 6b on the contrary topic attention of climate change adrian et al 2009 woolway et al 2020 decreased in 1950 1970 then increased in 1970 2000 and remained at 0 01 since 2010 with the increasing number of published articles the proportion of topics fluctuated greatly before the 1970s decreased from 1970 to 2000 and tended to be stable after 2000 this finding is hard to be observed through the time series analysis of original keywords supporting materials fig s2 fig 6c showed that the topics became more and more diverse at the speed of exponential growth over the past seven decades however in terms of proportion with 1 the number of topics was keeping decreasing it reveals that the lake studies are more and more concentrated relatively on the other side the number of keywords 5 year count 5 within one topic increased with time fig 6d for example the topic of sediment had just 3 keywords count 5 in 1970 1975 but it increased to 79 in 2015 2020 indicating that the topic has been understood with more deep insights not only does a single topic have a distinguishable evolution curve but dependency or co occurrence of two or more topics can also present more interesting evolution trends it can also be more objective due to a quantitative search in the existing literature here taking topics of phytoplankton phosphorus p and nitrogen n as dependent topics we compared the relative importance of phosphorus and nitrogen to phytoplankton in general discussions liang et al 2020 paerl et al 2016 qin et al 2020 based on nlu dc it can conduct a more careful dependency analysis of keywords meanwhile the search span could be extended to abstract of articles for more potential co occurrence that may not exist in keywords as a result the specific keywords of p which co occurred with phytoplankton were phosphorus phosphate nitrogen and phosphorus soluble reactive phosphorus and phosphorus loading and the keywords of n were nitrogen nitrate nitrite inorganic nitrogen denitrification organic nitrogen and nitrogen limitation fig 7 a the number of articles in which phytoplankton only co occurred with p was twice that only co occurred with n and almost 1 3 of articles focusing on both n and p with phytoplankton for temporal trend both of the co occurrence frequencies of the p phytoplankton pair and the n phytoplankton pair have been rising since the 1990 s fig 7b however the annual proportion of the n phytoplankton pair increased compared with the p phytoplankton pair fig 7c demonstrating the relationships between nitrogen and phytoplankton are catching more research interest heisler et al 2008 sinha et al 2017 sutton et al 2011 3 4 identification of evolution patterns to better understand the trend changes we proposed a conceptual evolution curve which is similar to population growth in the biological life cycle eberhardt et al 2008 six patterns were identified by glm as snippets from the curve first in the early stage of life cycle fluctuating topics like anorthite evaluation siberia acipenser and atlantic are changing disorderly with small attention fig 8 a towards the right topics invasive species biodiversity taihu ribosomal rna modis and tibetan plateau emerged from 1970 to 2000 chen et al 1999 cohen et al 1993 li and yang 1995 may and marsden 1992 climate change holocene stable isotope cyanobacteria and wetland emerged in 1970 ludden et al 1983 ritchie 1969 stewart 1975 with large growth speed fig 8b c they were rising fast in short term periods likely linking with the current global focus of climate change and biodiversity next continuous increasing topics with the most growth speed fig 8d supporting materials fig s3 such as carbon water quality river model new species pollen and aquatic plant are medium term hot spots on the carbon cycle pennak 1963 related to aquatic plants misra 1938 terriere et al 1966 climate redway 1924 steenbergen and verdouw 1982 and numerical models csanady 1968 fee 1973 liston and hall 1995 then stable topics e g fish eutrophication nitrogen diatom and mercury kept a balanced scale from 1970 to 2020 korthals and winfrey 1987 oliver and nicol 1982 schelske et al 1986 fig 8e at the end of the curve the number of studies on topics sediment phosphorus phytoplankton great lake distribution and zooplankton was highest brunberg and bostrom 1992 jasser 1995 jorgensen 1995 but they are inclined to a relative decreasing trend fig 8f besides topics polychlorinated biphenyls daphnia and united states america have experienced two or more patterns that cannot be detected with glm supporting materials fig s4 interestingly 308 31 topics were formed before 1970 of which 102 topics had an upward trend and 206 topics had a downward trend in comparison 188 19 topics emerged around 1970 revealing that the 1970s was the peak time of emerging topics lemoalle et al 2012 stockwell et al 2009 more unexpectedly only 37 4 topics appeared after the 1970s and most of them were proposed before 2000 few improvements have expanded researches in the field of the lake in 2000 2020 it may imply that there have been few brand new topics on lakes in the past 20 years considering the emerging interdisciplinary studies in the past decades for the whole scientific community there is therefore a great need for interdisciplinary research to explore the complex interactions between the lake and the natural and anthropogenic pressures the relative attention of many topics was gradually declining and their growth speed has slowed down especially for the topics of tdp the challenge is how to push these evolution curves forward and make the systematic research of lakes more dynamic we found that a potential way is to strengthen the coupled researches between emerging and trending down topics fig 9 a showed the complex co occurrence of top 60 topics topic pairs phosphorus sediment metal sediment carbon sediment nitrogen phosphorus eutrophication phosphorus climate change holocene holocene pollen and phytoplankton zooplankton were the most popular co occurrence benito et al 2015 chen et al 2018 hampton et al 2017 rajeshkumar et al 2018 schindler 2012 these pairs mainly came from the types of tdp stp tup and eip in particular tdp correlated strongly with eip for instance sediment co occurred with climate change and holocene fig 9b yet topics of eap such as invasive species biodiversity taihu ribosomal rna and modis showed inadequate co occurrence with popular topics like sediment phytoplankton food web but their dependency has been proved with point to point lake studies rajeshkumar et al 2018 turner et al 2015 wagner et al 2012 if possible promoting the integration of eap and tdp could not only accelerate the emerging topics with advanced methods of large trending down topics but also keep longer attention on trending down topics some suggestions can be drawn from the above analysis including a paying more attention to topics of eap such as invasive species biodiversity ribosomal rna taihu tibetan plateau and permafrost b intensifying the integration of topics of tdp and eap for example sediment should be analyzed on the tibetan plateau for unclear holocene climatic changes chen et al 2016 or remote sensing like modis is used for long term daily scale changes of phytoplankton or carbon duan et al 2017 not just periods of algal blooms tan et al 2017 the interdisciplinary studies of lakes mainly derived from the combination of classic lake topics and interdisciplinary methods we found before 1980s the studies related to lakes were to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of environmental factors phytoplankton and fish and corresponding mechanism process by sampling which was the main concern of traditional limnology except for the mechanism model characterized by mathematical equations and solvers interdisciplinary methods were rarely used then studies had paid more attention to the relationship and effects between variables and more and more complex mechanism models had been developed and applied benefiting from the boost in computer science the stable isotope methods for paleoclimatology had grown rapidly and expanded to hydrology sediment and ecology around 2000 remote sensing began to be introduced to the study of lake transparency water temperature and vegetation and early machine learning algorithms were used to predict the state of lakes since 2010 in addition to the extensive use of remote sensing stable isotope and mechanism models deep learning has also been applied to increase the estimation accuracy of water area chlorophyll and water quality dna and rna techniques are applied to detect the complicated dynamics of aquatic microbes geophysical chemical and biological methods have been more integrated and keeps a growing trend the nlu dc consists of state of the art deep learning models in natural language processing and efficient clustering algorithm in machine learning it is a general tool for clustering the text of any research field as well as lakes given the high performance of keyword clustering the ability to involve millions of studies and the availability on ordinary computers nlu dc was strongly recommended as a powerful approach to literature reviews in this study we retrieved 130 k articles from wos and the results were cogent despite some unavoidable bias these interesting conclusions presented a better global quantitative understanding of the domain identified the weak points and proposed suggestions for future improvement 4 conclusions a novel large text clustering algorithm nlu dc was proposed in this study for the identification of evolution patterns for lake topics over a centurial scale our study verified that the nlu dc is a very powerful method for global meta analysis of water related research fields the main conclusions are a the validated nlu dc algorithm reduced the keywords from 277 k to 29 8 k by 89 compared with unprocessed keywords the total count of top 100 topics increased by 239 b the high performance of nlu dc derives from a deep learning model cosine distance dbscan clustering and changing hyperparameters the evolution curve of hot topics of over 130 k articles on lakes was identified c topics on lakes became more and more abundant at the speed of exponential growth but were concentrated towards central points the dependency between topics particularly the relationship of nitrogen and phytoplankton is catching more attention than before d six evolution patterns as snippets from the evolution curve were identified with glm in recent twenty years few emerging topics attract significant academic attention strengthening the integration of emerging and trending down topics could not only accelerate studies on the emerging topics but also keep attention on trending down topics overall the high performance of nlu dc and its ability to involve millions of studies make it transferable to knowledge understanding and literature reviews in other fields of academical studies further the next paradigm of literature reviews will overcome the challenges of extracting target information by coupling with widespread natural language understanding techniques credit authorship contribution statement qingsong jiang conceptualization resources methodology visualization yanxin sun data curation

2781,investigating the response of vegetation phenology to meteorological drought can provide insight into the feedback mechanisms of ecosystems to environmental and climate change these key phenological parameters of vegetation are extracted on the china s loess plateau lp based on timesat using modis remote sensing data and their trends are estimated using sen s slope then response of key physical parameters of vegetation phenology to multi scale drought was investigated using standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the results show that 1 lp vegetation start of season sos and peak of season pos are delayed from south low elevation to north high elevation end of season eos is delayed from northeast to southwest length of season los show decrease trend with altitude and latitude increasing besides temporal variation of different vegetation phenological periods is highest in farmland and is lowest in the forest 2 vegetation sos and pos are advanced in the eastern part of lp and delayed in the western part meanwhile eos and los are advanced in the southern part of lp 3 the pos and eos of lp vegetation responded more significantly to drought the western longzhong plateau of lp was susceptible to the negative effects of preseason drought and the eastern northern shaanxi plateau and taihang mountains were susceptible to the positive effects moreover monthly and seasonal scale droughts have significantly effects on vegetation phenology than annual scale drought 4 compared to forest and grassland the vegetation phenology of farmland is more sensitive to monthly and seasonal scale droughts however the response of forest to annual scale drought is more significant the results of the study could provide scientific basis for crop yield stabilization and agricultural disaster warning in the lp keywords vegetation phenology timesat drought response loess plateau data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction as a sensitive and critical feature of vegetation phenology reflects the cyclical change pattern of surface vegetation which can serve as effective feedback of ecosystem to global environment and climate change fu et al 2020 drought is mainly triggered by reduced precipitation and moisture shortage affects vegetation phenology yannawut and teerawong 2017 in the background of global warming the hydrothermal conditions of vegetation are affected and lead to changes in growth patterns which cause changes in ecosystem material cycling processes hence it has an important impact on the crop yield and surface ecology daryanto et al 2017 feng and hao 2020 huang and wang 2021 investigating vegetation phenological changes and exploring the relationship between phenology and drought on multi scale can help to gain insight into the process of surface ecosystems change which is important for early warning of agricultural disasters and stability of crop yield remote sensing of phenological observation can obtain large scale and high temporal resolution phenological information in time xiao et al 2022 hence it can provide information on the dynamics of vegetation from small regions to global sacle and explore the impact of climate changes on vegetation phenology white et al 1997 cui et al 2017 it has been demonstrated that the key parameters of vegetation index extracts such as ndvi and evi based on remote sensing data are effective in monitoring vegetation phenology changes some results showed that the trend of sos advance and eos delay in recent decades mid to high latitudes in the northern hemisphere ren et al 2020 zhao et al 2015 however the regional variation in vegetation phenology is large in different periods and regions of china there is pattern of advanced sos delayed eos and extended los in different degrees tang et al 2015 liu et al 2020 previous studies indicate that pre season climatic elements such as temperature precipitation sunshine and thermal conditions play a dominant role in influencing the phenological period cui et al 2021 gastaldi et al 2020 liu et al 2018 zuo et al 2021 for example increasing precipitation can extend the growing season in canadian and ethiopian grasslands and precipitation in the previous autumn and winter have led to an earlier vegetation sos in the tibetan plateau cui et al 2017 workie and debella 2018 zhang et al 2018 drought disrupts the water network of vegetation roots and is the main abiotic factor affecting vegetation growth therefore this will be exacerbated in the context of global warming and drying bian et al 2022 frank et al 2015 ma et al 2022 sun et al 2017 ren et al 2019 analyzed wheat phenology on a global scale and showed that drought cause wheat to end its growing season early li et al 2020 found that drought is delayed with increasing pos on the tibetan plateau temperature is the main driver of phenological change in most regions besides precipitation also plays an important role in arid and semi arid zones such as the lp wang et al 2016a zheng et al 2016 the topography of the lp in the arid and semi arid region is complex and diverse and is a sensitive area for climate change the surface vegetation has been significantly changed in recent years jin et al 2020 wang et al 2018 research on the vegetation phenology of the lp have shown that the los lengthens significantly and the impact of extreme weather on the eos is greater than the sos with the climate warming wang et al 2016a pei et al 2021 in addition some studies revealed that the lag the lag between vegetation index and drought is less than 2 3 months kong et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 however fewer studies have evaluated the lp response to drought in different vegetation phenology categories at multiple time scales most of the previous studies used station observation data or interpolation meteorological data to calculate the drought index which can hardly reflect the influence of topography and landscape on regional climate at geographical scales the downscaling of meteorological grid point data using the delta method can obtain more accurate meteorological data then we can explore the effects of drought on vegetation phenology more accurately at the geographic scale ren et al 2018 therefore this study analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and trend of vegetation phenology sos pos eos and los on the lp from 2001 to 2019 then the spei was calculated based on the meteorological grid point data using the delta method with spatial downscaling finally the response of the lp phenology to monthly seasonal and annual scale drought was evaluated in different vegetation phenology categories 2 methods and data 2 1 study area lp is located in the transition zone from plain to plateau with complex natural environment serious soil erosion and surface vegetation conditions affected by both natural and human factors according to the 2019 mcd12q1 data from the international geosphere biosphere program igbp classification criteria there are 16 vegetation types including evergreen coniferous forests and deciduous coniferous forests hence land use types are classified into five types forest grassland farmland built up areas and others et al fig 1 b finally three types of forest grassland and farmland were selected as the vegetation of lp and the remaining two types were treated with masks 2 2 data the modis evi data used to extract vegetation phenology parameters were obtained from the united states geological survey usgs earth data center https lpdaacsvc cr usgs gov the spatial resolution is 1 km 1 km the temporal resolution is 16 days and the time range is mod13a2 data from january 2001 to december 2019 land use and vegetation type data were selected from mcd12q1 data for 2019 with a spatial resolution of 500 m 500 m the delta downscaling method used a high spatial resolution reference climate dataset which is derived from meteorological raster data from the national center for ecological science data http rs cern ac cn the dataset was generated by interpolation using station observation data combined with topography and geomorphology the spatial resolution is 1 km 1 km and the time range is from 1961 to 2000 meteorological variables include precipitation and average temperature the low spatial resolution meteorological data were obtained from the national weather science data center https www data cma cn monthly precipitation and average temperature value grid point dataset v2 0 for the time period january 1961 to december 2019 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 2 3 methods 2 3 1 extraction of vegetation phenology the source of remote sensing data and the method of parameter extraction have a significantly impact on the accuracy of the extracted phenological parameters among the various remote sensing vegetation indices of vegetation phenology ndvi and evi are the most widely used ndvi has the problem of high background noise in areas with low vegetation cover such as the western part of the lp zeng et al 2020 besides evi minimizes cloud interference prioritizes image elements with small sensor views and is insensitive to soil noise fu et al 2020 in this study timesat software was used to reconstruct evi datatime series timesat contains three methods savitzky golay filtering sg asymmetric gaussian function fitting ag and double logistic function fitting dl wu et al 2009 showed that sg can be clear to display data details but data noise id high ag can better reflect the seasonal characteristics and general trends of vegetation phenology in china the extraction of characteristic parameters is most applied by the threshold method besides based on the threshold method jönsson and eklundh 2002 proposed a dynamic threshold method based on the seasonal variation characteristics of vegetation indices which eliminat the influence of factors such as soil and vegetation type on the phenological period kang et al 2018 showed that the dynamic threshold method is more reliable in the semi arid region of northern china therefore ag and dynamic threshold method were used to extract the vegetation phenology parameters of the lp it is important to note that due to the nature of timesat software calculations it can only yield n 1 intermediate seasonal phenological parameters jönsson and eklundh 2004 therefore the actual derived phenological parameters in this study belong to the period 2002 2019 in this study evi was used to extract key parameters of the vegetation phenological period on the lp to reduce the effect of equipment and other meteorological factors on the evi values modis pixel reliability data were used to process the images for reliability check in order to better describe the vegetation growth process the asymmetric gaussian function method in timesat software was used to fit the evi long time series and the dynamic threshold method was used to extract the vegetation phenological parameters of the lp with reference to the experience of other scholars pei et al 2021 after comparison and validation with the data from the phenological observation sites the sos threshold was set to the time point when the evi curve was 20 from the minimum value in the rising phase and the eos threshold was set to 80 from the maximum value in the falling phase expressed as equation 1 1 evi ratio evi i evi min evi max evi min in the formula evi i represents the value at the time i evi max and evi min represents the seasonal maximum and minimum values in the evi cycle respectively in this paper four key parameters of vegetation phenology including sos pos eos and los were extracted 2 3 2 sen s slope estimation method as opposed to simple linear regression analysis the slope estimation method base on the median function proposed by sen 1968 can reduce the effect of outliers see equation 2 2 β m e d i a n x k x i k i k i in the formula β is the trend of change xk and xi are the values at time k and i respectively and median is the median function β greater than or less than 0 indicates that the time series is trending upward or downward respectively 2 3 3 delta spatial downscaling method the delta method is a statistical downscaling method that superimposes the simulated precipitation variability on the actual meteorological grid data and improves the spatial resolution of the data to obtain meteorological data on small geographic scales for precipitation the method is calculated by using a high spatial resolution climate dataset as reference data with a low spatial resolution measured climate dataset then the monthly precipitation is compared with the simulated average precipitation on a cell by cell basis and the absolute rate of change of precipitation is calculated for each cell by cell finally the measured average precipitation of each image element is multiplied with the absolute change rate of the corresponding image element the precipitation results with a resolution of 1 km after downscaling were obtained in different period the detailed calculation steps are described in reference ren et al 2018 this paper used this method to downscale precipitation and air temperature and calculate the spei at 1 km resolution 3 results 3 1 the phenological pattern of vegetation on the lp fig 2 shows the spatial pattern of the multi year average of key seasonal parameters sos pos eos and los of vegetation phenology for the lp from 2001 to 2019 extracted using timesat software the vegetation sos of lp was mainly concentrated on the 90th 150th day early april to late may showing a pattern of delay from the southern low elevation areas to the northern and western high elevation areas fig 2a sos was early in most of the southern the earliest values were concentrated in the weihe plain the latest values were concentrated in the ordos plateau and the hetao plain as well as in the northern part of the lvliang mountains and the taihang mountains pos was mainly concentrated in the 190th 240th day early july to late august and the spatial distribution was similar to the beginning of the period with earlier in the south and later in the west and north central part showing an obvious pattern of gradual postponement from the south and east to the northwest of the lp fig 2b the earliest values were mainly concentrated in the weihe plain and the latest in the central northern shaanxi plateau of lp eos was mainly on days 230th 280th late august to early october showed an overall pattern of late in the central and northwestern parts of the plateau and early around fig 2c the end of the vegetation growing season was earlier in the weihe plain probably due to earlier crop harvesting and earlier in the qilian mountains in the western part of the plateau probably due to higher altitude the longzhong plateau northern shaanxi plateau and ordos plateau all had later eos the vegetation of loess plateau from 2001 to 2019 los was mainly in the range of 100 160 days and the overall spatial distribution showed short in the north and west and long in the south fig 2d areas with los less than 100 days were mainly distributed in the hetao plain and the northern side of taihang and lvliang mountains and the southern part of shaanxi plateau and fenwei plain had longer los reaching more than 160 days and were suitable as grain crop production areas the distribution of los in lp was roughly opposite to that of altitude and overall the higher the altituded the shorter the los of the region the los was long in the lower elevation areas in the southern part of the plateau and short in the eastern side of the qilian mountains and the ordos plateau in the north the characteristics of the phenological periods in various vegetation species is different fig 3 the temporal distribution of phenological periods was most distributed in forest followed by grassland and most dispersed in lp farmland farmland is more complex in terms if crop species and cultivation environment so the phenological period is most dispersed the temporal distribution of various vegetation types in pos and eos was more concentrated than that in sos the time span of los was the largest in the farmland and the smallest in the forest 3 2 variation trend of vegetation phenology on the lp as shown in fig 4 and fig 5 a the overall trend of sos advanced in the northeastern and delayed in the southwestern depending on the p value it was divided into four categories by mann kendall the areas with sos delayed passed the significance level test of α 0 05 and mainly distributed in the longzhong plateau and the hetao plain the region with sos significant advanced was mainly distributed in the eastern side of the qilian mountains the northern shaanxi plateau and the southeastern fig 4 and fig 5 b demonstrate that the pos showed a pattern of delay in the western and advance in the eastern part the delayed pos in the western side of the qilian mountains longzhong plateau and hetao plain passed the α 0 05 significance level test the pos of lp were significantly advanced in northern shaanxi plateau as well as the southeastern the overall pattern of eos in the lp showed a delay in the west and north while an advance in the southeast fig 4c and fig 5c the qilian mountains and the western side of the longzhong plateau were delayed significant and some parts of the southeastern lp were significantly advanced meanwhile the los showed an overall pattern of increasing in the west and north decreasing in the south and northwest the areas with los significant increase were concentrated in the western and central parts of the lp the qilian mountains and the northern shaanxi plateau the areas with los significant decrease trend were mainly distributed in the fenwei plain and hetao plain fig 4 and fig 5d 3 3 response of vegetation phenology to drought at different time scales the relationship between drought and phenology in other regions show that the effects of drought on phenological indicators were different in various regions previous studies by some scholars kong et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 showed that phenology was highly sensitive to short time scale 1 3 months drought so this study mainly explored the effect of monthly and seasonal drought on phenological period the correlation coefficients were used to express the response relationships and the significance level of α 0 05 for the key phenological parameters of vegetation on the lp at multi scale drought as shown in figs 6 8 0 47 is the critical value under the n 18 and α 0 05 significance level test when the correlation coefficient of two variables is greater than 0 47 it indicates a significant correlation the spatial distribution of seasonal scale drought effects on phenology was shown in fig 6 the most significant negative effects of drought on the longzhong plateau phenological period were in the summer of previous year sos and the spring of current year pos and eos respectively pos and eos were mainly positively affected by the winter drought at the beginning of the year in the northern shaanxi plateau and ordos plateau the sos in the qilian mountains was most significantly negatively affected by the autumn of the previous year while the eos was most significantly affected by the positive impact of the autumn of the current year the spatial characteristics of annual scale drought effects on phenology were shown in fig 7 the sos of the longzhong plateau was significantly positively correlated with the drought of the previous year but the pos and eos were significantly negatively correlated with the drought of the current year however the areas with significant positive correlation between pos and the drought of the previous year are mainly distributed in the northern shaanxi plateau the sos of the hetao plain and the fenwei plain were most significantly affected by the current year drought in addition the ratio of significant correlation area between sos pos eos and spei 1 and the mean significant correlation coefficient is show in table 1 the significant positive negative correlation between spei and sos was found in march of the current year and october of the previous year february and may were the significant positive correlation between spei and pos besides ratio of significant correlation area and mean of correlation is highest in the eos while the significant positive negative correlation between spei and eos were occurred in august and april we selected months with significant positive and negative correlation to spatial analysis fig 8 on the whole the positive effect of monthly drought on vegetation phenology was greater in the eastern part of lp among them the pos and eos responded to the monthly drought more obviously in lvliang and taihang mountains while the negative effect of monthly drought on vegetation phenology was more obvious in the western part of lp this also reflects the obvious spatial heterogeneity of the effects of monthly drought on vegetation phenology in lp the same as seasonal and annual drought compared with this spring the drought in the previous summer had a greater impact on the sos and the drought slowed down earlier the positive effect of drought on sos was more pronounced in the previous autumn and early winter besides drought in early winter had a positive impact on eos and the slowing down of drought delayed the end of vegetation growing season the lp was negatively influenced by monthly drought in the west and more significantly influenced by drought in the east for each time scale monthly and seasonal droughts had more significant effects on vegetation phenology than annual droughts and more areas were significantly correlated 3 4 response of different types of vegetation phenology to drought in addition the response of phenological periods to seasonal annual and monthly droughts were plotted separately in four vegetation types all vegetation farmland grassland and forest fig 9 the percentage of areas with significance levels passed the α 0 05 test and the mean correlation coefficient under different phenological period corresponding were shown at multi time scale drought among the sos of various vegetation types the current year drought had the most significant negative correlation with the forest followed by the previous autumn fig 9a 9b spring drought in most areas has a significant negative impact on the productivity of farmland ecosystems followed by may fig 9c 9d for eos farmland was positively affected by drought in august fig 9e 9f taking into account the proportions and correlation coefficients of areas significantly affected by drought at different scales on vegetation phenology we selected the drought scales that had the greatest impact on each phenological index the drought in october last year had the most significant negative impact on the sos of lp vegetation while the drought in february august had the most significant positive impact on the vegetation pos eos the results showed that farmland and grassland with shallow root systems are more susceptible to short term drought impacts than dry forests with deeper root systems however farmland is cultivated more frequently than grassland it absorbs and evaporates water more easily this may be why farmland is more susceptible to monthly scale drought than other vegetation types 4 discussion 4 1 the phenological pattern and change trend of vegetation on the lp the multi year mean sos showed a pattern of delay from lower elevations in the south to higher elevations in the north which is in accordance with hopkins law vegetation sos is later at higher elevations the spatial pattern of sos and eos was verified by other scholars as well as ground based phenological observation sites pei et al 2021 li et al 2022 however there are also some differences with the findings of some scholars xie et al 2015 due to the influence of different data sources and time periods of the study among them sos in the qilian mountains region was slightly delayed and eos was relatively early but the spatial distribution of both is the same the phenological characteristics of the three vegetation types also showed some temporal variability the root systems of different types of vegetation depend on soil moisture at different depths liu et al 2021 the growth of farmland can only use shallow soil water moreover the greatest temporal variability in phenological periods was due to differences in surface anthropogenic cultivation practices elevation and other factors besides the lower temporal variability of forests may be due to the relationship between root depth surface moisture and evapotranspiration for example when the soil contains water to a depth of more than one meter the forest is not affected by precipitation and evapotranspiration fang et al 2016 the vegetation sos showed an early trend in the northeast and a delayed trend in the southwest and northwest while the eos showed an overall delay trend and an early trend in the southeast which was consistent with the findings of other scholars pei et al 2021 wang et al 2016a in lp suitable climatic factors in autumn and winter extend the vegetation growth period and the increase in temperature leads to delayed sos in water scarce areas such as the hetao plain and longzhong plateau in this study liu et al 2022 ji et al 2021 also found that drought may cause a delay in sos besides the trend of pos of lp was analyzed showing an earlier trend in the southeast and a later trend in the west the pattern was similar to the spatial distribution of rainfall indicating that rainfall will play a role in controlling the pos of vegetation we accurately obtain the peak arrival time of crop growth stages which can provide a reference for scientific control of crop yield temperature is the main driver of phenological change in most regions moreover precipitation is also play an important role in arid and semi arid zones and may even limited vegetation phenology zheng et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 xie et al 2015 jiao et al 2020 it can be noted that there was an early trend of the phenological period in the western longzhong plateau and the central shaanxi plateau of lp meanwhile other scholar also found that all the above mentioned areas show a trend of increasing precipitation or wetting in recent years pang et al 2019 besides the eos of vegetation in water scarce areas has been delayed by the increase in temperature in recent years in the central of lp sun et al 2015 the southern part of the lp and the hetao plain los showed a decreasing trend and the western and the northeastern part shown an increasing trend xiao et al 2020 the southeastern lp is mainly affected by the east asian monsoon especially in summer while it has shown a decreasing trend in recent years resulting in an earlier eos with a shorter los in the southern lp awan et al 2015 for the major grain producing areas in the fenwei plain reduced ecological losses lead to shorter growing times for crops which may have some impact on their yields in general the trends of sos and pos are significantly affected by longitude mainly in the eastern part of lp which is greatly affected by the east asian monsoon the altitude also influences the trend of los with a significant decrease in the length of los at low altitude and a significant increase at high altitude 4 2 response of vegetation phenology to drought on the lp at present the commonly used meteorological drought indicators include the standardized precipitation index spi palmer drought severity index pdsi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei among them spei has the advantages of considering multiple time scales and more meteorological elements such as temperature wind speed relative humidity and so on which is more conducive to the comprehensive consideration of the response of vegetation phenology to drought most of the lp is in the arid semi arid zone spei as indicators for drought monitoring could clarified the effects of drought caused by precipitation and temperature on vegetation phenology pre season drought causes delayed sos in mongolian plateau grasslands wu et al 2022 ge et al 2021 founded that drought before spring have a significant effect on sos and summer drought have lead to earlier eos in the yunnan guizhou plateau yuan et al 2020 founded that grassland is highly sensitive to drought on 1 2 and 3 month time scales in semi arid area it has been found that at lp vegetation productivity is most sensitive to drought at the 3 and 12 month scales zhao et al 2018 this study characterized monthly seasonal and annual droughts on the lp using spei and calculated correlation coefficients with key phenological periods on a cell by cell basis to represent their response to droughts at different time scales vegetation water deficit due to drought is a long process for example zhao et al 2020 found that the lag time of drought on grassland is about 2 3 months while the cumulative effect of drought on vegetation could be as long as 5 10 months the weakening of drought before spring on the lp led to the advancement of sos in that year it is confirmed that the intensification of spring drought leads to the lack of water required for vegetation growth which leads to the delay of sos in addition the exacerbated spring drought in the southwestern part of the lp affected the carbon water balance required for vegetation growth resulting in a delay in pos in addition lp vegetation showed that sos was advanced pos and eos were delayed due to drought furthermore pos and eos responded to drought more significantly than sos wang et al 2016a compared to annual droughts the effects of monthly and seasonal droughts on vegetation phenology were more pronounced especially for eos wang et al 2016b luo et al 2021 this is also consistent with the results of other authors kong et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 that the lag of vegetation relative to meteorological elements and drought at lp is generally less than 2 to 3 months drought in spring and may was significantly negative correlated with pos in the western lp and a weakening of the drought 2 3 months earlier led to an earlier arrival of pos in the north central lp eos was mainly positively affected by early winter and spring droughts while the south was mainly positively affected by august and summer droughts the weakening of the drought at the above time delayed eos and longer vegetation growth period the high latitude areas in the northern part of lp were relatively more water scarce hence the lag time of the phenological period affected by drought was longer than that in the south in terms of spatial distribution the response of the phenological periods to meteorological drought at each time scale was significantly different in western and eastern lp the western part of the lp was negatively affected by drought in spring and may while the eastern part of lp was more significantly affected by early winter and positive influence in february and august the vegetation phenology was most negatively affected by drought in the western part of the lp especially in the longzhong plateau which is related to the significant wetting of the region in recent years pang et al 2019 the eastern part of lp was mainly affected by the east asian monsoon while the western part was less affected therefore the vegetation phenological period in the west showed a negative influence on drought which was shown to be earlier due to the decreasing of drought in contrast the eastern part of the lp was affected by the east asian monsoon and the tends of precipitation is decreasing the phenological period was still delayed the response of different types of vegetation to drought at different time scales is varies the response of farmland and grassland to monthly and seasonal drought is more significant than that of forest this may be due to the relatively shallow root burial in farmland and grassland vegetation which is more sensitive to short term responses to precipitation and temperature furthermore zhao et al 2020 also showed a 1 3 month time lag to drought in grasslands forests responded more significantly to annual drought due to their deeper root systems and insensitivity to short term meteorological factors fang et al 2016 the lp phenology was more responsive to short term 1 3 months scale meteorological drought and shown significant spatial heterogeneity the time scale and the direction of the most susceptible to drought in different landscape regions varied the phenology is susceptible to the positive effects of february august winter and the previous year s drought in the northern shanxi plateau and the taihang mountains the phenology is negatively influenced by april may spring and drought of the previous year in longzhong plateau the complex climate types and numerous vegetation types in lp make it difficult to describe the response of local phenology to drought as a whole the simple climate vegetation or land type zoning is also difficult to clearly distinguish the characteristics of the response to drought and more detailed zoning should be considered in the next step furthermore lp is susceptible to the east asian monsoon in the taihang mountains the longzhong plateau and qilian mountains have a large variability in phenological response to drought in the 21st century drought will tend to worsen in most parts of the world wang et al 2021 will the response of vegetation phenology to future droughts in the above regions continue this pattern this is one of the next steps to be carried out the results can help local authorities to take timely measures to reduce crop losses due to drought according to pre season drought conditions when extracting vegetation phenology parameters in the current study we did not consider the effect of different farming systems both natural and agricultural vegetation were considered to have one growing season per year however a double growing season is exists such as the fenwei plain where winter wheat and summer maize are cultivated in rotation therefore the results in this study are only applicable to areas with one growing season per year considerations under different tillage systems will be carried on in the next study 5 conclusion this study analyzed the characteristics of lp vegetation phenological periods and explored the response of phenological periods to monthly seasonal and annual droughts using spei the conclusions were as follows 1 lp vegetation sos and pos were delayed from south to north and from low to high elevations eos was delayed from northeast to southwest los overall decreased in length with increasing elevation and latitude the temporal variability of the phenological period was greatest in farmland and least in forest 2 the vegetation sos and pos are significantly advanced in the northern shaanxi plateau and significantly delayed in the hetao plain and longzhong plateau eos was significantly delayed in the qilian mountains los was significantly advanced in the hetao plain and southeastern lp and significantly delayed in the qilian mountains and northeastern lp 3 lp vegetation showed an advance in sos and a delay in pos and eos due to drought while pos and eos responded more significantly to drought than sos however it showed greater spatial heterogeneity according to the time scale pos eos in the western longzhong plateau was susceptible to negative effects of drought in may april spring and the current year the pos and eos are susceptible to the positive influence of winter and the previous year s drought in the eastern northern shaanxi plateau both pos and eos in the east of taihang mountain are positively affected by drought in february and august 4 monthly and seasonal are more signiant than annual drought on vegetation phenological period besides pos and eos in farmland responded more significantly to monthly and seasonal droughts forest sos had the most significant response to annual drought credit

2781,investigating the response of vegetation phenology to meteorological drought can provide insight into the feedback mechanisms of ecosystems to environmental and climate change these key phenological parameters of vegetation are extracted on the china s loess plateau lp based on timesat using modis remote sensing data and their trends are estimated using sen s slope then response of key physical parameters of vegetation phenology to multi scale drought was investigated using standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the results show that 1 lp vegetation start of season sos and peak of season pos are delayed from south low elevation to north high elevation end of season eos is delayed from northeast to southwest length of season los show decrease trend with altitude and latitude increasing besides temporal variation of different vegetation phenological periods is highest in farmland and is lowest in the forest 2 vegetation sos and pos are advanced in the eastern part of lp and delayed in the western part meanwhile eos and los are advanced in the southern part of lp 3 the pos and eos of lp vegetation responded more significantly to drought the western longzhong plateau of lp was susceptible to the negative effects of preseason drought and the eastern northern shaanxi plateau and taihang mountains were susceptible to the positive effects moreover monthly and seasonal scale droughts have significantly effects on vegetation phenology than annual scale drought 4 compared to forest and grassland the vegetation phenology of farmland is more sensitive to monthly and seasonal scale droughts however the response of forest to annual scale drought is more significant the results of the study could provide scientific basis for crop yield stabilization and agricultural disaster warning in the lp keywords vegetation phenology timesat drought response loess plateau data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction as a sensitive and critical feature of vegetation phenology reflects the cyclical change pattern of surface vegetation which can serve as effective feedback of ecosystem to global environment and climate change fu et al 2020 drought is mainly triggered by reduced precipitation and moisture shortage affects vegetation phenology yannawut and teerawong 2017 in the background of global warming the hydrothermal conditions of vegetation are affected and lead to changes in growth patterns which cause changes in ecosystem material cycling processes hence it has an important impact on the crop yield and surface ecology daryanto et al 2017 feng and hao 2020 huang and wang 2021 investigating vegetation phenological changes and exploring the relationship between phenology and drought on multi scale can help to gain insight into the process of surface ecosystems change which is important for early warning of agricultural disasters and stability of crop yield remote sensing of phenological observation can obtain large scale and high temporal resolution phenological information in time xiao et al 2022 hence it can provide information on the dynamics of vegetation from small regions to global sacle and explore the impact of climate changes on vegetation phenology white et al 1997 cui et al 2017 it has been demonstrated that the key parameters of vegetation index extracts such as ndvi and evi based on remote sensing data are effective in monitoring vegetation phenology changes some results showed that the trend of sos advance and eos delay in recent decades mid to high latitudes in the northern hemisphere ren et al 2020 zhao et al 2015 however the regional variation in vegetation phenology is large in different periods and regions of china there is pattern of advanced sos delayed eos and extended los in different degrees tang et al 2015 liu et al 2020 previous studies indicate that pre season climatic elements such as temperature precipitation sunshine and thermal conditions play a dominant role in influencing the phenological period cui et al 2021 gastaldi et al 2020 liu et al 2018 zuo et al 2021 for example increasing precipitation can extend the growing season in canadian and ethiopian grasslands and precipitation in the previous autumn and winter have led to an earlier vegetation sos in the tibetan plateau cui et al 2017 workie and debella 2018 zhang et al 2018 drought disrupts the water network of vegetation roots and is the main abiotic factor affecting vegetation growth therefore this will be exacerbated in the context of global warming and drying bian et al 2022 frank et al 2015 ma et al 2022 sun et al 2017 ren et al 2019 analyzed wheat phenology on a global scale and showed that drought cause wheat to end its growing season early li et al 2020 found that drought is delayed with increasing pos on the tibetan plateau temperature is the main driver of phenological change in most regions besides precipitation also plays an important role in arid and semi arid zones such as the lp wang et al 2016a zheng et al 2016 the topography of the lp in the arid and semi arid region is complex and diverse and is a sensitive area for climate change the surface vegetation has been significantly changed in recent years jin et al 2020 wang et al 2018 research on the vegetation phenology of the lp have shown that the los lengthens significantly and the impact of extreme weather on the eos is greater than the sos with the climate warming wang et al 2016a pei et al 2021 in addition some studies revealed that the lag the lag between vegetation index and drought is less than 2 3 months kong et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 however fewer studies have evaluated the lp response to drought in different vegetation phenology categories at multiple time scales most of the previous studies used station observation data or interpolation meteorological data to calculate the drought index which can hardly reflect the influence of topography and landscape on regional climate at geographical scales the downscaling of meteorological grid point data using the delta method can obtain more accurate meteorological data then we can explore the effects of drought on vegetation phenology more accurately at the geographic scale ren et al 2018 therefore this study analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and trend of vegetation phenology sos pos eos and los on the lp from 2001 to 2019 then the spei was calculated based on the meteorological grid point data using the delta method with spatial downscaling finally the response of the lp phenology to monthly seasonal and annual scale drought was evaluated in different vegetation phenology categories 2 methods and data 2 1 study area lp is located in the transition zone from plain to plateau with complex natural environment serious soil erosion and surface vegetation conditions affected by both natural and human factors according to the 2019 mcd12q1 data from the international geosphere biosphere program igbp classification criteria there are 16 vegetation types including evergreen coniferous forests and deciduous coniferous forests hence land use types are classified into five types forest grassland farmland built up areas and others et al fig 1 b finally three types of forest grassland and farmland were selected as the vegetation of lp and the remaining two types were treated with masks 2 2 data the modis evi data used to extract vegetation phenology parameters were obtained from the united states geological survey usgs earth data center https lpdaacsvc cr usgs gov the spatial resolution is 1 km 1 km the temporal resolution is 16 days and the time range is mod13a2 data from january 2001 to december 2019 land use and vegetation type data were selected from mcd12q1 data for 2019 with a spatial resolution of 500 m 500 m the delta downscaling method used a high spatial resolution reference climate dataset which is derived from meteorological raster data from the national center for ecological science data http rs cern ac cn the dataset was generated by interpolation using station observation data combined with topography and geomorphology the spatial resolution is 1 km 1 km and the time range is from 1961 to 2000 meteorological variables include precipitation and average temperature the low spatial resolution meteorological data were obtained from the national weather science data center https www data cma cn monthly precipitation and average temperature value grid point dataset v2 0 for the time period january 1961 to december 2019 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 2 3 methods 2 3 1 extraction of vegetation phenology the source of remote sensing data and the method of parameter extraction have a significantly impact on the accuracy of the extracted phenological parameters among the various remote sensing vegetation indices of vegetation phenology ndvi and evi are the most widely used ndvi has the problem of high background noise in areas with low vegetation cover such as the western part of the lp zeng et al 2020 besides evi minimizes cloud interference prioritizes image elements with small sensor views and is insensitive to soil noise fu et al 2020 in this study timesat software was used to reconstruct evi datatime series timesat contains three methods savitzky golay filtering sg asymmetric gaussian function fitting ag and double logistic function fitting dl wu et al 2009 showed that sg can be clear to display data details but data noise id high ag can better reflect the seasonal characteristics and general trends of vegetation phenology in china the extraction of characteristic parameters is most applied by the threshold method besides based on the threshold method jönsson and eklundh 2002 proposed a dynamic threshold method based on the seasonal variation characteristics of vegetation indices which eliminat the influence of factors such as soil and vegetation type on the phenological period kang et al 2018 showed that the dynamic threshold method is more reliable in the semi arid region of northern china therefore ag and dynamic threshold method were used to extract the vegetation phenology parameters of the lp it is important to note that due to the nature of timesat software calculations it can only yield n 1 intermediate seasonal phenological parameters jönsson and eklundh 2004 therefore the actual derived phenological parameters in this study belong to the period 2002 2019 in this study evi was used to extract key parameters of the vegetation phenological period on the lp to reduce the effect of equipment and other meteorological factors on the evi values modis pixel reliability data were used to process the images for reliability check in order to better describe the vegetation growth process the asymmetric gaussian function method in timesat software was used to fit the evi long time series and the dynamic threshold method was used to extract the vegetation phenological parameters of the lp with reference to the experience of other scholars pei et al 2021 after comparison and validation with the data from the phenological observation sites the sos threshold was set to the time point when the evi curve was 20 from the minimum value in the rising phase and the eos threshold was set to 80 from the maximum value in the falling phase expressed as equation 1 1 evi ratio evi i evi min evi max evi min in the formula evi i represents the value at the time i evi max and evi min represents the seasonal maximum and minimum values in the evi cycle respectively in this paper four key parameters of vegetation phenology including sos pos eos and los were extracted 2 3 2 sen s slope estimation method as opposed to simple linear regression analysis the slope estimation method base on the median function proposed by sen 1968 can reduce the effect of outliers see equation 2 2 β m e d i a n x k x i k i k i in the formula β is the trend of change xk and xi are the values at time k and i respectively and median is the median function β greater than or less than 0 indicates that the time series is trending upward or downward respectively 2 3 3 delta spatial downscaling method the delta method is a statistical downscaling method that superimposes the simulated precipitation variability on the actual meteorological grid data and improves the spatial resolution of the data to obtain meteorological data on small geographic scales for precipitation the method is calculated by using a high spatial resolution climate dataset as reference data with a low spatial resolution measured climate dataset then the monthly precipitation is compared with the simulated average precipitation on a cell by cell basis and the absolute rate of change of precipitation is calculated for each cell by cell finally the measured average precipitation of each image element is multiplied with the absolute change rate of the corresponding image element the precipitation results with a resolution of 1 km after downscaling were obtained in different period the detailed calculation steps are described in reference ren et al 2018 this paper used this method to downscale precipitation and air temperature and calculate the spei at 1 km resolution 3 results 3 1 the phenological pattern of vegetation on the lp fig 2 shows the spatial pattern of the multi year average of key seasonal parameters sos pos eos and los of vegetation phenology for the lp from 2001 to 2019 extracted using timesat software the vegetation sos of lp was mainly concentrated on the 90th 150th day early april to late may showing a pattern of delay from the southern low elevation areas to the northern and western high elevation areas fig 2a sos was early in most of the southern the earliest values were concentrated in the weihe plain the latest values were concentrated in the ordos plateau and the hetao plain as well as in the northern part of the lvliang mountains and the taihang mountains pos was mainly concentrated in the 190th 240th day early july to late august and the spatial distribution was similar to the beginning of the period with earlier in the south and later in the west and north central part showing an obvious pattern of gradual postponement from the south and east to the northwest of the lp fig 2b the earliest values were mainly concentrated in the weihe plain and the latest in the central northern shaanxi plateau of lp eos was mainly on days 230th 280th late august to early october showed an overall pattern of late in the central and northwestern parts of the plateau and early around fig 2c the end of the vegetation growing season was earlier in the weihe plain probably due to earlier crop harvesting and earlier in the qilian mountains in the western part of the plateau probably due to higher altitude the longzhong plateau northern shaanxi plateau and ordos plateau all had later eos the vegetation of loess plateau from 2001 to 2019 los was mainly in the range of 100 160 days and the overall spatial distribution showed short in the north and west and long in the south fig 2d areas with los less than 100 days were mainly distributed in the hetao plain and the northern side of taihang and lvliang mountains and the southern part of shaanxi plateau and fenwei plain had longer los reaching more than 160 days and were suitable as grain crop production areas the distribution of los in lp was roughly opposite to that of altitude and overall the higher the altituded the shorter the los of the region the los was long in the lower elevation areas in the southern part of the plateau and short in the eastern side of the qilian mountains and the ordos plateau in the north the characteristics of the phenological periods in various vegetation species is different fig 3 the temporal distribution of phenological periods was most distributed in forest followed by grassland and most dispersed in lp farmland farmland is more complex in terms if crop species and cultivation environment so the phenological period is most dispersed the temporal distribution of various vegetation types in pos and eos was more concentrated than that in sos the time span of los was the largest in the farmland and the smallest in the forest 3 2 variation trend of vegetation phenology on the lp as shown in fig 4 and fig 5 a the overall trend of sos advanced in the northeastern and delayed in the southwestern depending on the p value it was divided into four categories by mann kendall the areas with sos delayed passed the significance level test of α 0 05 and mainly distributed in the longzhong plateau and the hetao plain the region with sos significant advanced was mainly distributed in the eastern side of the qilian mountains the northern shaanxi plateau and the southeastern fig 4 and fig 5 b demonstrate that the pos showed a pattern of delay in the western and advance in the eastern part the delayed pos in the western side of the qilian mountains longzhong plateau and hetao plain passed the α 0 05 significance level test the pos of lp were significantly advanced in northern shaanxi plateau as well as the southeastern the overall pattern of eos in the lp showed a delay in the west and north while an advance in the southeast fig 4c and fig 5c the qilian mountains and the western side of the longzhong plateau were delayed significant and some parts of the southeastern lp were significantly advanced meanwhile the los showed an overall pattern of increasing in the west and north decreasing in the south and northwest the areas with los significant increase were concentrated in the western and central parts of the lp the qilian mountains and the northern shaanxi plateau the areas with los significant decrease trend were mainly distributed in the fenwei plain and hetao plain fig 4 and fig 5d 3 3 response of vegetation phenology to drought at different time scales the relationship between drought and phenology in other regions show that the effects of drought on phenological indicators were different in various regions previous studies by some scholars kong et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 showed that phenology was highly sensitive to short time scale 1 3 months drought so this study mainly explored the effect of monthly and seasonal drought on phenological period the correlation coefficients were used to express the response relationships and the significance level of α 0 05 for the key phenological parameters of vegetation on the lp at multi scale drought as shown in figs 6 8 0 47 is the critical value under the n 18 and α 0 05 significance level test when the correlation coefficient of two variables is greater than 0 47 it indicates a significant correlation the spatial distribution of seasonal scale drought effects on phenology was shown in fig 6 the most significant negative effects of drought on the longzhong plateau phenological period were in the summer of previous year sos and the spring of current year pos and eos respectively pos and eos were mainly positively affected by the winter drought at the beginning of the year in the northern shaanxi plateau and ordos plateau the sos in the qilian mountains was most significantly negatively affected by the autumn of the previous year while the eos was most significantly affected by the positive impact of the autumn of the current year the spatial characteristics of annual scale drought effects on phenology were shown in fig 7 the sos of the longzhong plateau was significantly positively correlated with the drought of the previous year but the pos and eos were significantly negatively correlated with the drought of the current year however the areas with significant positive correlation between pos and the drought of the previous year are mainly distributed in the northern shaanxi plateau the sos of the hetao plain and the fenwei plain were most significantly affected by the current year drought in addition the ratio of significant correlation area between sos pos eos and spei 1 and the mean significant correlation coefficient is show in table 1 the significant positive negative correlation between spei and sos was found in march of the current year and october of the previous year february and may were the significant positive correlation between spei and pos besides ratio of significant correlation area and mean of correlation is highest in the eos while the significant positive negative correlation between spei and eos were occurred in august and april we selected months with significant positive and negative correlation to spatial analysis fig 8 on the whole the positive effect of monthly drought on vegetation phenology was greater in the eastern part of lp among them the pos and eos responded to the monthly drought more obviously in lvliang and taihang mountains while the negative effect of monthly drought on vegetation phenology was more obvious in the western part of lp this also reflects the obvious spatial heterogeneity of the effects of monthly drought on vegetation phenology in lp the same as seasonal and annual drought compared with this spring the drought in the previous summer had a greater impact on the sos and the drought slowed down earlier the positive effect of drought on sos was more pronounced in the previous autumn and early winter besides drought in early winter had a positive impact on eos and the slowing down of drought delayed the end of vegetation growing season the lp was negatively influenced by monthly drought in the west and more significantly influenced by drought in the east for each time scale monthly and seasonal droughts had more significant effects on vegetation phenology than annual droughts and more areas were significantly correlated 3 4 response of different types of vegetation phenology to drought in addition the response of phenological periods to seasonal annual and monthly droughts were plotted separately in four vegetation types all vegetation farmland grassland and forest fig 9 the percentage of areas with significance levels passed the α 0 05 test and the mean correlation coefficient under different phenological period corresponding were shown at multi time scale drought among the sos of various vegetation types the current year drought had the most significant negative correlation with the forest followed by the previous autumn fig 9a 9b spring drought in most areas has a significant negative impact on the productivity of farmland ecosystems followed by may fig 9c 9d for eos farmland was positively affected by drought in august fig 9e 9f taking into account the proportions and correlation coefficients of areas significantly affected by drought at different scales on vegetation phenology we selected the drought scales that had the greatest impact on each phenological index the drought in october last year had the most significant negative impact on the sos of lp vegetation while the drought in february august had the most significant positive impact on the vegetation pos eos the results showed that farmland and grassland with shallow root systems are more susceptible to short term drought impacts than dry forests with deeper root systems however farmland is cultivated more frequently than grassland it absorbs and evaporates water more easily this may be why farmland is more susceptible to monthly scale drought than other vegetation types 4 discussion 4 1 the phenological pattern and change trend of vegetation on the lp the multi year mean sos showed a pattern of delay from lower elevations in the south to higher elevations in the north which is in accordance with hopkins law vegetation sos is later at higher elevations the spatial pattern of sos and eos was verified by other scholars as well as ground based phenological observation sites pei et al 2021 li et al 2022 however there are also some differences with the findings of some scholars xie et al 2015 due to the influence of different data sources and time periods of the study among them sos in the qilian mountains region was slightly delayed and eos was relatively early but the spatial distribution of both is the same the phenological characteristics of the three vegetation types also showed some temporal variability the root systems of different types of vegetation depend on soil moisture at different depths liu et al 2021 the growth of farmland can only use shallow soil water moreover the greatest temporal variability in phenological periods was due to differences in surface anthropogenic cultivation practices elevation and other factors besides the lower temporal variability of forests may be due to the relationship between root depth surface moisture and evapotranspiration for example when the soil contains water to a depth of more than one meter the forest is not affected by precipitation and evapotranspiration fang et al 2016 the vegetation sos showed an early trend in the northeast and a delayed trend in the southwest and northwest while the eos showed an overall delay trend and an early trend in the southeast which was consistent with the findings of other scholars pei et al 2021 wang et al 2016a in lp suitable climatic factors in autumn and winter extend the vegetation growth period and the increase in temperature leads to delayed sos in water scarce areas such as the hetao plain and longzhong plateau in this study liu et al 2022 ji et al 2021 also found that drought may cause a delay in sos besides the trend of pos of lp was analyzed showing an earlier trend in the southeast and a later trend in the west the pattern was similar to the spatial distribution of rainfall indicating that rainfall will play a role in controlling the pos of vegetation we accurately obtain the peak arrival time of crop growth stages which can provide a reference for scientific control of crop yield temperature is the main driver of phenological change in most regions moreover precipitation is also play an important role in arid and semi arid zones and may even limited vegetation phenology zheng et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 xie et al 2015 jiao et al 2020 it can be noted that there was an early trend of the phenological period in the western longzhong plateau and the central shaanxi plateau of lp meanwhile other scholar also found that all the above mentioned areas show a trend of increasing precipitation or wetting in recent years pang et al 2019 besides the eos of vegetation in water scarce areas has been delayed by the increase in temperature in recent years in the central of lp sun et al 2015 the southern part of the lp and the hetao plain los showed a decreasing trend and the western and the northeastern part shown an increasing trend xiao et al 2020 the southeastern lp is mainly affected by the east asian monsoon especially in summer while it has shown a decreasing trend in recent years resulting in an earlier eos with a shorter los in the southern lp awan et al 2015 for the major grain producing areas in the fenwei plain reduced ecological losses lead to shorter growing times for crops which may have some impact on their yields in general the trends of sos and pos are significantly affected by longitude mainly in the eastern part of lp which is greatly affected by the east asian monsoon the altitude also influences the trend of los with a significant decrease in the length of los at low altitude and a significant increase at high altitude 4 2 response of vegetation phenology to drought on the lp at present the commonly used meteorological drought indicators include the standardized precipitation index spi palmer drought severity index pdsi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei among them spei has the advantages of considering multiple time scales and more meteorological elements such as temperature wind speed relative humidity and so on which is more conducive to the comprehensive consideration of the response of vegetation phenology to drought most of the lp is in the arid semi arid zone spei as indicators for drought monitoring could clarified the effects of drought caused by precipitation and temperature on vegetation phenology pre season drought causes delayed sos in mongolian plateau grasslands wu et al 2022 ge et al 2021 founded that drought before spring have a significant effect on sos and summer drought have lead to earlier eos in the yunnan guizhou plateau yuan et al 2020 founded that grassland is highly sensitive to drought on 1 2 and 3 month time scales in semi arid area it has been found that at lp vegetation productivity is most sensitive to drought at the 3 and 12 month scales zhao et al 2018 this study characterized monthly seasonal and annual droughts on the lp using spei and calculated correlation coefficients with key phenological periods on a cell by cell basis to represent their response to droughts at different time scales vegetation water deficit due to drought is a long process for example zhao et al 2020 found that the lag time of drought on grassland is about 2 3 months while the cumulative effect of drought on vegetation could be as long as 5 10 months the weakening of drought before spring on the lp led to the advancement of sos in that year it is confirmed that the intensification of spring drought leads to the lack of water required for vegetation growth which leads to the delay of sos in addition the exacerbated spring drought in the southwestern part of the lp affected the carbon water balance required for vegetation growth resulting in a delay in pos in addition lp vegetation showed that sos was advanced pos and eos were delayed due to drought furthermore pos and eos responded to drought more significantly than sos wang et al 2016a compared to annual droughts the effects of monthly and seasonal droughts on vegetation phenology were more pronounced especially for eos wang et al 2016b luo et al 2021 this is also consistent with the results of other authors kong et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 that the lag of vegetation relative to meteorological elements and drought at lp is generally less than 2 to 3 months drought in spring and may was significantly negative correlated with pos in the western lp and a weakening of the drought 2 3 months earlier led to an earlier arrival of pos in the north central lp eos was mainly positively affected by early winter and spring droughts while the south was mainly positively affected by august and summer droughts the weakening of the drought at the above time delayed eos and longer vegetation growth period the high latitude areas in the northern part of lp were relatively more water scarce hence the lag time of the phenological period affected by drought was longer than that in the south in terms of spatial distribution the response of the phenological periods to meteorological drought at each time scale was significantly different in western and eastern lp the western part of the lp was negatively affected by drought in spring and may while the eastern part of lp was more significantly affected by early winter and positive influence in february and august the vegetation phenology was most negatively affected by drought in the western part of the lp especially in the longzhong plateau which is related to the significant wetting of the region in recent years pang et al 2019 the eastern part of lp was mainly affected by the east asian monsoon while the western part was less affected therefore the vegetation phenological period in the west showed a negative influence on drought which was shown to be earlier due to the decreasing of drought in contrast the eastern part of the lp was affected by the east asian monsoon and the tends of precipitation is decreasing the phenological period was still delayed the response of different types of vegetation to drought at different time scales is varies the response of farmland and grassland to monthly and seasonal drought is more significant than that of forest this may be due to the relatively shallow root burial in farmland and grassland vegetation which is more sensitive to short term responses to precipitation and temperature furthermore zhao et al 2020 also showed a 1 3 month time lag to drought in grasslands forests responded more significantly to annual drought due to their deeper root systems and insensitivity to short term meteorological factors fang et al 2016 the lp phenology was more responsive to short term 1 3 months scale meteorological drought and shown significant spatial heterogeneity the time scale and the direction of the most susceptible to drought in different landscape regions varied the phenology is susceptible to the positive effects of february august winter and the previous year s drought in the northern shanxi plateau and the taihang mountains the phenology is negatively influenced by april may spring and drought of the previous year in longzhong plateau the complex climate types and numerous vegetation types in lp make it difficult to describe the response of local phenology to drought as a whole the simple climate vegetation or land type zoning is also difficult to clearly distinguish the characteristics of the response to drought and more detailed zoning should be considered in the next step furthermore lp is susceptible to the east asian monsoon in the taihang mountains the longzhong plateau and qilian mountains have a large variability in phenological response to drought in the 21st century drought will tend to worsen in most parts of the world wang et al 2021 will the response of vegetation phenology to future droughts in the above regions continue this pattern this is one of the next steps to be carried out the results can help local authorities to take timely measures to reduce crop losses due to drought according to pre season drought conditions when extracting vegetation phenology parameters in the current study we did not consider the effect of different farming systems both natural and agricultural vegetation were considered to have one growing season per year however a double growing season is exists such as the fenwei plain where winter wheat and summer maize are cultivated in rotation therefore the results in this study are only applicable to areas with one growing season per year considerations under different tillage systems will be carried on in the next study 5 conclusion this study analyzed the characteristics of lp vegetation phenological periods and explored the response of phenological periods to monthly seasonal and annual droughts using spei the conclusions were as follows 1 lp vegetation sos and pos were delayed from south to north and from low to high elevations eos was delayed from northeast to southwest los overall decreased in length with increasing elevation and latitude the temporal variability of the phenological period was greatest in farmland and least in forest 2 the vegetation sos and pos are significantly advanced in the northern shaanxi plateau and significantly delayed in the hetao plain and longzhong plateau eos was significantly delayed in the qilian mountains los was significantly advanced in the hetao plain and southeastern lp and significantly delayed in the qilian mountains and northeastern lp 3 lp vegetation showed an advance in sos and a delay in pos and eos due to drought while pos and eos responded more significantly to drought than sos however it showed greater spatial heterogeneity according to the time scale pos eos in the western longzhong plateau was susceptible to negative effects of drought in may april spring and the current year the pos and eos are susceptible to the positive influence of winter and the previous year s drought in the eastern northern shaanxi plateau both pos and eos in the east of taihang mountain are positively affected by drought in february and august 4 monthly and seasonal are more signiant than annual drought on vegetation phenological period besides pos and eos in farmland responded more significantly to monthly and seasonal droughts forest sos had the most significant response to annual drought credit

2782,water managers and researchers noted with concern a nearly generalized decline in mediterranean rivers discharge over the last decades changes in climatic forces precipitation and air temperature and land use and land cover lulc changes characterized by re vegetation and greenness are the two most possible explanations for this discharge decline the direct impact on river discharge stemming from these changes is difficult to assess and their role is generally studied separately here we use the method of wavelet transformation to interpret the time scale dependency of catchment discharge concerning the uneven temporal climatic fluctuations and re vegetation processes we analyzed the temporal variation of concurrent air temperature precipitation and river discharge time series for the upper aragón catchment located in the central spanish pyrenees a long term database collected over 60 years 1956 2020 was used land cover maps corresponding to different decades were used and the results indicated that the catchment experienced a significant increase in the area covered by mixed and broadleaf forests mostly as a consequence of land abandonment we show how temperature slightly increased and precipitation moderately decreased however catchment discharge experienced a sharp decline in its magnitude and also changes in its temporal variability dynamics the relevance of the seasonal time scales with regard to the available discharge is reduced which strengthens the importance of the inter annual time scales for the catchment discharge dynamics furthermore the catchment storage discharge cycle at inter annual time scales is also reduced such changes can mostly be attributed to the changes in plant coverage with an increasing weight in shaping hydrological processes at catchment scale due to the greenness effect as such we conclude that lulc changes have played a dominant role on the river discharge dynamics climatic trends on the contrary have been small and they have played a secondary role in the decline of river discharge future research can use these observations to constrain the pace of upcoming water demands based on the available water resources at mediterranean catchment scale keywords river discharge climate change greenness wavelet analysis water management mediterranean catchments data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction discharge regime in most river catchments shows considerable variability at different time scales in the short term months because of hydropower plants operations or snow melting due to the diurnal cycle seasonally summer and winter annually dry and wet periods and in the long term multiannual trends this fluctuation in discharge implies varying water resources which may lead to problems in meeting water demand for agricultural purposes hydropower or human consumption this is an important challenge worldwide barnett et al 2004 black 2016 and particularly in the mediterranean area where water is a scarce resource garcía ruiz et al 2011 lópez moreno et al 2014 mediterranean environments are primarily modulated by the water resources yielded by headwaters located in the upper mountainous regions such mountain areas are identified as wet islands or water towers within dry climate zones viviroli et al 2007 immerzeel et al 2020 and they are highly vulnerable to climate change in a number of ways giorgi 2006 european environment agency 2015 furthermore most of the mediterranean mountains have followed the historical land use and land cover lulc change agricultural abandonment of the cultivated fields due to rural depopulation at the turn of the second half of the twentieth century and subsequent progressive natural or man made plant recolonization or afforestation lasanta et al 2005 lasanta et al 2017 garcía ruiz and lana renault 2011 therefore the response of hydrological processes and water resources to global change need to be assessed in order to support and guide water policy and management practices in mediterranean regions a great number of physical processes acting at different and varying time scales influence in the discharge variability at the basin scale both climatic forces and vegetation are known as key drivers in river discharge dynamics beguería et al 2003 guardiola claramonte et al 2011 ficklin et al 2018 water resources for discharge and ultimately for human purposes and freshwater ecosystems depend on the partition of precipitation between runoff generation and water consumption by vegetation rulli et al 2013 the changes in the relative importance of the partition of precipitation may thus provide information of the influence of climate change and land use and land cover change processes on the availability of water resources climate projections indicate that periods with water deficits are expected to increase in frequency and severity in future decades in large regions of the world zhao and dai 2022 hertig and tramblay 2017 furthermore radiative forcing increases atmospheric evaporative demand vicente serrano et al 2020 which may also reinforce streamflow reduction in some regions vicente serrano et al 2014 in parallel to this there is an increase of water consumption by vegetation as consequence of greenness and re vegetation processes mankin et al 2018 forzieri et al 2020 vicente serrano et al 2021 which is also suggested to dominate available water for discharge in future climate change scenarios mankin et al 2019 nonetheless other studies also advance that under elevated values of co2 plants display higher rates of photosynthesis and decreased water use ainsworth rogers 2007 this in turn may have as a consequence an increase in soil moisture levels and runoff generation leakey et al 2009 there is therefore a considerable debate and uncertainty about the role of climate and vegetation in the river catchment response to global change the analysis of hydro climatic time series to identify temporal patterns of discharge fluctuations as well as their underlying drivers is often based on standard statistical techniques fourier analysis or autoregressive models the shortcoming of applying such analysis is that the identification of correlations of time series require stationary relationships however on the basis of climate change and greenness process we hypothesize that hydrological processes at river catchment scale change with time wavelet analysis takes into account non stationary relationships among datasets torrence compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 particularly the continuous wavelet transform is a useful tool for the extraction of features especially of complex time series with a lot of noise furthermore wavelet transform allows to time localize the dominant time scales within the complete temporal spectrum ultimately identifying the variability of each time scale all through the study period contrary to fourier spectral analysis or autoregressive analysis wavelet methodology was thus successfully used to analyze hydro climatic time series segele et al 2009 labat 2010 or catchment temporal dynamics carey et al 2013 weigand et al 2017 pérez ciria et al 2019 pérez ciria and chiogna 2020 juez nadal romero 2021 lorenzo lacruz et al 2022 in this study the wavelet methodology in combination to traditional correlation analysis are applied to a long period database 1956 2000 with air temperature precipitation and discharge records measured at six monitoring stations of the upper aragón catchment located in the central spanish pyrenees this catchment underwent an intense process of re vegetation for the last decades lasanta et al 2005 garcía ruiz et al 2015 we analyze the non stationary impacts of climatic forces and re vegetation processes on river discharge we further hypothesized that besides climatic trends seasonal annual the major controlling factor of the variability and magnitude of discharge at river catchment are vegetation changes 2 the upper aragón catchment and available data 2 1 the study area the upper aragón catchment is located in the central spanish pyrenees and it has an area of 2181 km2 see fig 1 the primary river of this catchment is the aragón river which starts at the astún valley in the north of the catchment at an altitude of 2600 m a s l the aragón river flows north south through the canfranc valley and then turns to the west in jaca downstream jaca the aragón river heads west until reaching the end of the catchment which coincides with the yesa reservoir the three main tributaries draining water to the catchment are subordán veral and esca within the domain of the catchment excluding the yesa reservoir located at the outlet there are no dams or reservoirs and consequently the river discharge follows a natural unmanaged regime the upper aragón catchment contains areas with limestone sandstone clay and marls the catchment altitude ranges between 2600 m a s l in the northernmost area and 500 m a s l at yesa reservoir the mean annual precipitation in the catchment is approximately 860 mm spring and autumn are the rainiest seasons summer is the driest season and it gets occasional storms due to convective processes the average daily temperature in the catchment is 12 c snow cover is found in high altitude above the 1500 m a s l from december to april lópez moreno and garcía ruiz 2004 vegetation cover in the catchment was strongly impacted by human activities historically cultivated areas were located below 1600 m a s l in the valley bottoms flat areas and steep south facing hillslopes which were managed even under shifting agriculture systems lasanta 1998 forests pinus sylvestris fagus sylvatica are located on the north facing slopes and everywhere between 1600 and 1800 m a s l between 1950 and 1960 most of the cultivated fields were abandoned with the exception of those located in the valley bottom the abandoned fields which represent around 25 of the catchment area faced a process of greenness and plant re colonization vicente serrano et al 2006 2 2 air temperature precipitation discharge and land cover datasets daily discharge time series data for the period 1956 2020 were obtained for six gauging stations aragón jaca subordán javierregay veral zuriza veral biniés esca sigüés and aragón yesa see fig 1 for the location and table 1 for the main characteristics of each cathment discharge data were measured for the study period through the float method and water level probes rating curves were created based on the measurements data was available from the ebro water authorities che https www chebro es daily precipitation for the six gauging stations and air temperature for the upper aragón catchment were obtained from the spanish national meteorological service agencia estatal de meteorología aemet further details about the processing methodology of this data set can be found in vicente serrano et al 2017 given the time scale analysis purposed in this study we use the climatic time series corresponding to the closest weather station to each gauging station land use and land cover maps for the decades of 1960s and 2010s were provided by the spanish ministry of agriculture based on interpreting aerial photographs and conducting fieldwork these maps were created at a spatial scale of 1 50 000 see fig 1 furthermore the normalized different vegetation index ndvi was used to infer consistent temporal vegetation growth and coverage dynamics ndvi was calculated at a spatial resolution of 1 1 km using the noaa avhrr images covering the period from 1982 to 2015 vicente serrano et al 2020 combined with modis ndvi huete et al 2002 for the period 2000 2020 both datasets were standardized using the reference period 2000 2015 in order to provide homogeneous series that are not affected by the change of satellites 3 methods 3 1 mann kendall test the mann kendall test is a classical statistical tool used in hydrological and climatic variables to assess whether a set of data values is increasing or decreasing over time and whether the trend in either direction is statistically significant autocorrelation was considered in the trend analysis this test was used with a twofold purpose i to detect significant long term trends in the database and ii to assess the impact of greenness and re vegetation processes on long term trends for two equally spaced periods 1956 1988 and 1989 2020 these two periods correspond to different vegetation levels the first period 1956 1988 corresponds to the early land abandonment process and further process of secondary succession of shrubs followed by trees a natural vegetation cover colonized most of the former cultivated fields which represent around 25 of the catchment area see vicente serrano et al 2006 furthermore slopes and terraces were afforested for economic and environmental purposes the second period 1989 2020 corresponds to a period with small changes in relation to the area of abandoned fields this period is characterized by a consolidation process of the greenness expansion triggered during previous years with well rooted and mature vegetation the surface occupied by mixed and broadleaf forests is significantly increased for the 1989 2020 period see fig 1 3 2 wavelet analysis air temperature precipitation and discharge time series are rarely stationary and they consist of a broad set of transient patterns varying within the temporal record the wavelet transform allows to localize in both time and periodicity the transient patterns recorded in such non stationary time series it thus provides a complete time scale representation of localized and transient phenomena occurring at different time scales torrence compo 1998 in this research we make use of the morlet wavelet which was successfully used in the past to analyze precipitation and discharge time series carey et al 2013 labat et al 2005 juez and nadal romero 2021 juez et al 2021 this wavelet type is characterized as 1 φ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e η 2 2 where φ 0 η is the wavelet function η is a dimensionless time parameter i is the imaginary unit and ω 0 is the dimensionless angular frequency taken as 6 which provides a right match between time and frequency localization thus for a time series xn for each scale s at all n of series length n the wavelet function is mathematically represented as 2 w n s n 0 n 1 x n ψ η η δ t s where wn s is the wavelet transform coefficients ψ the normalized wavelet the complex conjugate s the wavelet scale n the localized time index and n the translated time index of the time ordinate x it is possible to reconstruct the original signal by summing each time scale in addition to study the interaction between two time series we also compute a bivariate framework called squared wavelet coherence grinsted et al 2004 which compares two wavelet spectra corresponding to two time series the square wavelet coherence measures the local linear correlation between two time series x and y with wavelet transforms w n x s and w n y s at each time scale hence it is analogous to the squared correlation coefficient in linear regression because of these characteristics the squared wavelet coherence can identify regions in the time space where the examined time series co move but do not necessarily have a high common power we compute the squared wavelet coherence coefficients following the approach of grinsted et al 2004 3 r n 2 s s s 1 w n xy s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 being s a smoothing operator for both scale and time domain 4 s w s scale s time w n s where stime smooths along the time axis and sscale smooths along the scale axis the squared wavelet coherence coefficient is in the range 0 r n 2 s 1 values close to zero indicate weak correlation while values close to one provide evidence of strong correlation hence we discarded values where r n 2 s 0 5 to avoid non reliable estimations finally to complete the analysis the wavelet coherence phase difference is also computed to provide details on the oscillation cycles between two time series see lee and kim 2019 the phase difference is calculated as follows 5 ϕ n unknown template where im s w and re s w represent the imaginary and real part of s w respectively the phase differences are explained as the differences of both correlation and lagging relationships for example if the difference is zero the two time series are perfectly correlated and they move together values of phase difference in the interval 90 90 indicate the two time times are correlated values of phase difference between the interval 90 180 or between 90 180 indicate the two time series are anti correlated considering the correlation of our time series i e phase difference within the interval 90 90 the phase difference can be explained as the phase lagging negative values the first time series lags the second one or phase leading positive values the first time series leads the second one at specific time scales 4 results 4 1 temporal spectrum analysis precipitation patterns depict similar dynamics for the six catchment locations see fig 2 top rainiest seasons are spring march june and autumn october december discharge response patterns show similarities in temporal variability low flow during winter and summer and peak flow during late spring and differences in magnitude between gauging locations discharge records are lower at veral zuriza and veral biniés as these gauging stations are located at the headwaters and the drainage area is smaller conversely discharge records at aragón yesa are maximal because this downstream location drains water from the entire catchment fig 2 bottom displays the time series of air temperature for the river catchment an episodic pattern of increasing and decreasing temperature all through each year of the study period is observed fig 3 shows the corresponding global wavelet periodogram for precipitation discharge and air temperature time series local wavelet power is displayed in fig s1 of the supporting material this analysis allows to identify the non overlapping dominant time scales governing the temporal records based on the peaks with larger amplitude precipitation and discharge response features intra seasonal 0 003 0 5 years annual 1 year period short term annual 1 1 5 5 years and long term annual 5 5 20 years episodic patterns moreover the air temperature response features three dominant time scales related with annual 1 year period short term annual 1 1 5 5 years and long term annual 5 5 20 years episodic patterns in all the time series the annual cycle contains the dominant power furthermore there is also a strong variability around a time scale of 0 5 years for the precipitation and discharge time series this effect is further accentuated in the discharge response patterns where the time scale of 0 5 years peaks with higher power than in the precipitation response patterns the hydrological cycle of the aragón catchment is thus identified as a bi modal cycle with high flow seasons observed each year for two periods spring march june and autumn october december fig 4 displays the temporal scale by scale de composition of daily precipitation discharge and air temperature time series anomalies for the aragón jaca gauging station temporal anomalies for the other gauging stations are similar and are displayed in fig s2 of the supporting information for the sake of brevity the non overlapping time scale bands in fig 4 contain the major power peaks and are identified based on the global power spectra plotted in fig 3 positive and negative anomalies are calculated with respect to the mean values precipitation time series exhibit similar trends for the intraseasonal to seasonal short term and long term annual time scales differences are found in the annual time scales where it can be seen a slight decrease for the 1989 2020 period with respect to 1956 1988 period regarding the discharge time series for the annual and short term time scales a reduction in the magnitude of the anomalies are observed for the 1989 2020 period furthermore for the 1989 2020 period the short term annual time scale anomalies vary more slowly in a longer period of years and thus attenuate the contribution of the short term annual time scale in the discharge finally air temperature anomalies depict similar trends for all the time scales temporal dynamics of the upper aragón catchment are further analyzed by means of the percentage of changes computed for the 1956 2020 period see table 2 the increase in air temperature is observed all through the study period and it is statistically significant precipitation shows a slight decrease in all the gauging stations except in subordán javierregay where a subtle increase is observed these changes are not statistically significant in the majority of the gauging stations discharge shows a strong and statistically significant reduction in all the measuring stations except in veral zuriza where an important increase is recorded the strong discharge reduction ranging between 19 to 48 is not explained by the precipitation reduction ranging between 8 to 13 furthermore discharge reduction is more severe for the period 1956 1988 and for all the gauging stations specifically the highest discharge reduction is observed at aragón yesa this gauging station is located at the outlet of the river catchment and consequently amplifies any discharge change observed in the drainage area table 2 also shows the mean values for the 1956 1988 and 1989 2020 periods discharge shows a larger decline for the first time period decline ranging between 12 to 38 with regard to the second period decline ranging between 7 to 16 and with the exception of veral zuriza increase of 20 and 6 for the first and second period respectively table 3 displays the standard deviation change for precipitation discharge and air temperature time series for the 1956 1988 and 1989 2020 periods we used the standard deviation as a proxy to measure the magnitude of the anomalies in relation to the mean of the whole 1956 2020 period subsequently we computed the standard deviation change to assess any variability in other words any irregularity deviation between the two study periods an increase in the magnitude of the standard deviation i e more extreme values of precipitation is observed at the intraseasonal time scale for all the gauging stations furthermore looking at the mean values of the aragón catchment we observe higher standard deviation values for all the time scales for the 1989 2020 period this implies that anomalies in relation to the mean are more spread out and extreme events occurred more often discharge values show a decrease in the standard deviation values for the 1989 2020 period and for all the time scales the largest drop in the standard deviation values is noted for the intraseasonal and annual time scales lastly air temperature values show a slight increase in the standard deviation values for the intraseasonal values i e larger differences in temperature between winter and summer and a notable drop in the long term time scale i e a steady climatic trend is observed fig 5 displays the temporal evolution of the ndvi values computed for the upper aragón catchment and for the 1982 2020 period complete annual information before 1982 is not available as the first noaa avhrr satellite was launched in july 1981 ndvi shows a linear increase in parallel the standard deviation for each year was also computed and overlapped in the figure the standard deviation depicts a decline from 1986 to 1988 to 2020 4 2 significant wavelet coherence between hydro climatic time series the squared wavelet coherence between air temperature and discharge see fig 6 a displays strong wavelet coherence for seasonal and annual time scales before and after 1988 local squared wavelet coherence values are displayed in fig s3 this is not surprising given the high synchronicity in the annual dynamics of air temperature and resulting discharge high air temperatures during summer foster evaporation and water consumption by plants as a result available discharge is reduced in the whole catchment on the other hand the second period of study displays significant wavelet coherence for the long term time scale around 10 years this indicates that the dependency between years with abnormally high low air temperatures and discharge is accentuated for the 1989 2020 period conversely the squared wavelet coherence between precipitation and discharge see fig 6 b also shows strong wavelet coherence for seasonal and annual time scales before and after 1988 however a significant shift in the wavelet coherence is observed in the 3 12 years range for 1956 1988 the maximum peaks are clustered around time scales of 5 12 years range and for 1989 2020 the maximum peaks are clustered around time scales of 3 5 years range phase differences for the six gauging stations and for the two study periods are displayed in figs 7 and 8 air temperature and discharge time series see fig 7 are anti correlated for annual time scales phase difference interval between 180 90 which implies that as air temperature increases the discharge magnitude is reduced furthermore the 1989 2020 period shows two distinct trends with regard to the 1956 2020 period first looking at intraseasonal time scales at veral zuriza gauging station the discharge time series peaks before the air temperature time series second a delay between both time series is observed at short term time scales around 5 years the continuous and regular increase of air temperature for the study period around 1 2 c fosters the melting of traditionally perennial snow package located in the northernmost sector of the catchment and provides additional interannual discharge variability precipitation and discharge time series see fig 8 show a delay in discharge response with regard to precipitation for all the time scales conversely three notable differences are found between the two study periods one is that at intraseasonal time scales the delay between precipitation and discharge is larger for the 1989 2020 period the second point is that at annual time scales the delay between precipitation and discharge time series is slightly decreased in the 1989 2020 period in relation to the 1956 1988 period the last point is that while a certain level of variability is observed at time scales larger than 1 year for the 1956 1988 period those time scales show similar trends for the 1989 2020 period 5 discussion the analysis of long term data of precipitation air temperature and discharge time series is used to interpret the impacts of climate variability and generalized re vegetation and greenness observed at the upper aragón catchment in relation to discharge dynamics examination of the temporal structure of the datasets reveals dominant time scales accounting for seasonal annual short term annual and long term annual time scales the seasonal peaks around 0 5 years and annual time scales reflect a bi modal cycle with high flow seasons observed each year for two periods spring march june and autumn october december these characteristics of the yearly discharge distribution reflect that the upper aragón catchment follows mainly a precipitation hydrological regime with dry and wet periods but it is also partially modulated by the snow melting cycle of the headwaters in spring snow usually accumulates between december and april and it melts down during may lópez moreno et al 2013 lópez moreno et al 2020 the melting process of the winter snowpack notably contributes to the high flow season observed during late spring or early summer conversely the interannual time scales greater than1 year are mainly related to long term anomalies in the precipitation and flow events the role of these interannual time scales is of particular interest because their contribution fluctuates between transient periods of positive and negative values on the other hand magnitude and variability of the time series do not remain stationary and differences were found initially we computed the observed changes for the 1956 2020 period and we found that i air temperature was statistically significant increased in the catchment by 1 2 c ii precipitation rates were moderately and non statistically significant reduced ranging between 8 to 16 these precipitation trends are in agreement with observations over the western mediterranean region which are characterized by dominant internal variability of precipitation and non significant long term trends peña angulo et al 2020 and iii discharge values were strongly and statistically significant reduced ranging between 19 to 48 with the exception of veral zuriza this increase in discharge at veral zuriza the gauging station is located at a high elevation 1800 m ab s l in the northernmost part of the catchment and hence snow covers a larger percentage of the drained area see fig 1 is related with the increase of air temperature which favors the melting of snow package at the pyrenees and provides extra water resources to the river catchment vidaller et al 2021 the strong decline in discharge observed in the rest of the gauging stations cannot be attributed to drops in precipitation which are in a moderate reduction furthermore these discharge trends are in agreement with the trend observed in other natural non managed catchments in spain lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 martínez fernández et al 2013 vicente serrano et al 2020 in these studies authors attributed the decrease in water yield to the generalized greenness process as a result of land abandonment results herein outlined confirm that the increase of dense vegetation mixed and broadleaf forests corresponds with a decrease in discharge magnitude and also that precipitation trends play a secondary role in this discharge alteration non significant non statistically significant correlation and moderate alterations furthermore vegetation age may also affect the identified processes discharge reduction is more pronounced for the 1956 1988 period characterized by shrubs and young trees with regard to the 1989 2020 period characterized by mixed and broadleaf trees this is in agreement with previous studies which conclude that young forests consume more water than old growth forests delzon and loustau 2005 ellison et al 2017 teuling and hoek van dijke 2020 the importance of re vegetation and greenness on the available water resources in the aragón catchment is further stressed with the standard deviation change which is computed for the temporal anomalies before and after 1988 see table 3 increase of precipitation standard deviation is observed on average for the upper aragón catchment for all the time scales being the seasonal time scale the one with a larger increase around 15 in contrast larger reductions in the discharge standard deviation around 20 are observed for seasonal and annual time scales these reductions in the magnitude of discharge anomalies are related with the increasing modulating impact of the biophysical mechanisms of plants due to the increment of greenness see ndvi values in fig 5 during summer season water consumption by plants is increased and during winter season photosynthesis and transpiration processes by plants are reduced and so is the water consumption the increase of ndvi values runs in parallel to the intra annual ndvi standard deviation decline see fig 5 we thus show how the vegetation dynamics dominate the catchment discharge response at seasonal and annual time scales compared to the precipitation dynamics an additional interesting point about the differences in discharge dynamics before and after 1988 is the temporal shift in the wavelet coherence between precipitation and discharge time series at interannual time scales from the 5 12 years range 1956 1988 period to the 3 7 years range 1989 2020 as well as stronger coherence values for the 1989 2020 period see fig 6 b this different trend is explained based on two points one is that seasonal precipitation standard deviation change shows an increase for 1989 2020 around 15 see table 3 this precipitation standard deviation increase at seasonal time scales is linked to more severe and intermittent droughts vicente serrano et al 2014 the relevance of the seasonal timescales with regard to the available discharge is thus reduced which strengthens the importance of the inter annual time scales for the catchment discharge dynamics these inter annual time scales have the mission to recharge the water reserves of the catchment by which the discharge will be fed in the following years wang 2012 velasco et al 2017 juez and nadal romero 2020 the second point is that the greenness process observed all across the catchment has decreased the measured and visible discharge but it may have favored the groundwater discharge tree root architecture enhances hydraulic redistribution of water in soils prieto et al 2012 thereby old growth trees which correspond to the 1989 2020 period maximize groundwater recharge ilstedt et al 2016 wavelet coherence at inter annual time scales supports this point the catchment storage discharge cycle at inter annual time scales was reduced from the 5 12 years range 1956 1988 period to the 3 7 years range 1989 2020 in other words the temporal shift in the strong linear correlation between precipitation and discharge at inter annual time scales is due to the fact that water catchment reserves are filled in a shorter period of time phase difference response between precipitation and discharge time series see fig 8 is also a good proxy to understand the importance of vegetation on the catchment discharge at intraseasonal time scales the delay between precipitation and discharge is larger for the 1989 2020 period this is explained by the fact that the general re vegetation and greenness processes observed in the entire catchment modulate the response to precipitation van noordwijk et al 2016 plants especially tree roots enhance soil permeability keeler et al 2019 consequently infiltration processes are increased and resulting runoff is reduced this point helps to recharge groundwater and to mitigate floods grey et al 2018 furthermore at annual time scales the delay between precipitation and discharge time series is slightly decreased in the 1989 2020 period in relation to the 1956 1988 period this may indicate that re vegetation and greenness processes have favored the hydrological connectivity within the catchment trees improve soil structure and permeability channeling underground water miyata et al 2019 and ultimately have reduced the asynchrony between precipitation and discharge peaks the abandonment of cultivated areas in the upper aragón catchment resulted in the loss of the traditional rural mosaic with a more variable vegetation structure and lead to a process of greenness and plant re colonization which implies a more homogeneous landscape lasanta et al 2017 mantero et al 2020 looking at the phase difference response between precipitation and discharge time series in fig 8 we observe a remarkable homogenization trend for the 1989 2020 period with regard to the previous period and for all the study sites and time scales we thus believe that this markedly changes in the coupling between precipitation and discharge was owned by a process of vegetation homogenization in the whole catchment results herein described are in line with previous research on river headwaters in spain where a statistically significant discharge decline was observed during the last decades lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 martínez fernández et al 2013 therefore these results emphasize the need of implementing management policies for water limited environments such as the mountain areas in mediterranean regions traditional river catchment management is based on the capacity of water managers to meet water demand based on historical discharge patterns capon et al 2018 however projected climate and lulc scenarios in mediterranean catchments see garcía ruiz et al 2011 suggest i a continuous air temperature increase 1 6 c ii a decline in precipitations for the 21st century and iii an intense greenness processes with a significant upward shift of the upper treeline in most headwaters areas manrique alba et al 2022 this last point reveals critical in light of our results for this reason although water managers have no control on the climatic forces they can promote land management practices to reduce water consumption by vegetation in this regard silviculture practices such as clearing shrublands for livestock lasanta et al 2017 thinning to adapt dense stands of trees to available water resources manrique alba et al 2020 or uneven aged silviculture systems aszalós et al 2022 may be considered as needed tools for catchment management in mountain mediterranean areas 6 conclusions the temporal structure of concurrent air temperature precipitation and discharge time series at the upper aragón catchment was herein analyzed by means of the wavelet analysis the long term dataset combined with land cover maps and ndvi time series allow to explore the nature of discharge patterns and relate them to catchment and river processes occurring at different and non similar time scales in this catchment discharge experiences a dramatic drop in its magnitude for the study period and also changes in its temporal variability dynamics variability in climatic forces and lulc changes due to re vegetation and greenness are targeted as two possible explanations for this discharge decline the results illustrate that discharge reduction is mainly caused by the biophysical processes of plants with an increasing weight in shaping hydrological processes at catchment scale due to the greenness effect climatic fluctuations on the contrary play a secondary role and are only responsible of the partial decline in river discharge magnitude credit authorship contribution statement c juez

2782,water managers and researchers noted with concern a nearly generalized decline in mediterranean rivers discharge over the last decades changes in climatic forces precipitation and air temperature and land use and land cover lulc changes characterized by re vegetation and greenness are the two most possible explanations for this discharge decline the direct impact on river discharge stemming from these changes is difficult to assess and their role is generally studied separately here we use the method of wavelet transformation to interpret the time scale dependency of catchment discharge concerning the uneven temporal climatic fluctuations and re vegetation processes we analyzed the temporal variation of concurrent air temperature precipitation and river discharge time series for the upper aragón catchment located in the central spanish pyrenees a long term database collected over 60 years 1956 2020 was used land cover maps corresponding to different decades were used and the results indicated that the catchment experienced a significant increase in the area covered by mixed and broadleaf forests mostly as a consequence of land abandonment we show how temperature slightly increased and precipitation moderately decreased however catchment discharge experienced a sharp decline in its magnitude and also changes in its temporal variability dynamics the relevance of the seasonal time scales with regard to the available discharge is reduced which strengthens the importance of the inter annual time scales for the catchment discharge dynamics furthermore the catchment storage discharge cycle at inter annual time scales is also reduced such changes can mostly be attributed to the changes in plant coverage with an increasing weight in shaping hydrological processes at catchment scale due to the greenness effect as such we conclude that lulc changes have played a dominant role on the river discharge dynamics climatic trends on the contrary have been small and they have played a secondary role in the decline of river discharge future research can use these observations to constrain the pace of upcoming water demands based on the available water resources at mediterranean catchment scale keywords river discharge climate change greenness wavelet analysis water management mediterranean catchments data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction discharge regime in most river catchments shows considerable variability at different time scales in the short term months because of hydropower plants operations or snow melting due to the diurnal cycle seasonally summer and winter annually dry and wet periods and in the long term multiannual trends this fluctuation in discharge implies varying water resources which may lead to problems in meeting water demand for agricultural purposes hydropower or human consumption this is an important challenge worldwide barnett et al 2004 black 2016 and particularly in the mediterranean area where water is a scarce resource garcía ruiz et al 2011 lópez moreno et al 2014 mediterranean environments are primarily modulated by the water resources yielded by headwaters located in the upper mountainous regions such mountain areas are identified as wet islands or water towers within dry climate zones viviroli et al 2007 immerzeel et al 2020 and they are highly vulnerable to climate change in a number of ways giorgi 2006 european environment agency 2015 furthermore most of the mediterranean mountains have followed the historical land use and land cover lulc change agricultural abandonment of the cultivated fields due to rural depopulation at the turn of the second half of the twentieth century and subsequent progressive natural or man made plant recolonization or afforestation lasanta et al 2005 lasanta et al 2017 garcía ruiz and lana renault 2011 therefore the response of hydrological processes and water resources to global change need to be assessed in order to support and guide water policy and management practices in mediterranean regions a great number of physical processes acting at different and varying time scales influence in the discharge variability at the basin scale both climatic forces and vegetation are known as key drivers in river discharge dynamics beguería et al 2003 guardiola claramonte et al 2011 ficklin et al 2018 water resources for discharge and ultimately for human purposes and freshwater ecosystems depend on the partition of precipitation between runoff generation and water consumption by vegetation rulli et al 2013 the changes in the relative importance of the partition of precipitation may thus provide information of the influence of climate change and land use and land cover change processes on the availability of water resources climate projections indicate that periods with water deficits are expected to increase in frequency and severity in future decades in large regions of the world zhao and dai 2022 hertig and tramblay 2017 furthermore radiative forcing increases atmospheric evaporative demand vicente serrano et al 2020 which may also reinforce streamflow reduction in some regions vicente serrano et al 2014 in parallel to this there is an increase of water consumption by vegetation as consequence of greenness and re vegetation processes mankin et al 2018 forzieri et al 2020 vicente serrano et al 2021 which is also suggested to dominate available water for discharge in future climate change scenarios mankin et al 2019 nonetheless other studies also advance that under elevated values of co2 plants display higher rates of photosynthesis and decreased water use ainsworth rogers 2007 this in turn may have as a consequence an increase in soil moisture levels and runoff generation leakey et al 2009 there is therefore a considerable debate and uncertainty about the role of climate and vegetation in the river catchment response to global change the analysis of hydro climatic time series to identify temporal patterns of discharge fluctuations as well as their underlying drivers is often based on standard statistical techniques fourier analysis or autoregressive models the shortcoming of applying such analysis is that the identification of correlations of time series require stationary relationships however on the basis of climate change and greenness process we hypothesize that hydrological processes at river catchment scale change with time wavelet analysis takes into account non stationary relationships among datasets torrence compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 particularly the continuous wavelet transform is a useful tool for the extraction of features especially of complex time series with a lot of noise furthermore wavelet transform allows to time localize the dominant time scales within the complete temporal spectrum ultimately identifying the variability of each time scale all through the study period contrary to fourier spectral analysis or autoregressive analysis wavelet methodology was thus successfully used to analyze hydro climatic time series segele et al 2009 labat 2010 or catchment temporal dynamics carey et al 2013 weigand et al 2017 pérez ciria et al 2019 pérez ciria and chiogna 2020 juez nadal romero 2021 lorenzo lacruz et al 2022 in this study the wavelet methodology in combination to traditional correlation analysis are applied to a long period database 1956 2000 with air temperature precipitation and discharge records measured at six monitoring stations of the upper aragón catchment located in the central spanish pyrenees this catchment underwent an intense process of re vegetation for the last decades lasanta et al 2005 garcía ruiz et al 2015 we analyze the non stationary impacts of climatic forces and re vegetation processes on river discharge we further hypothesized that besides climatic trends seasonal annual the major controlling factor of the variability and magnitude of discharge at river catchment are vegetation changes 2 the upper aragón catchment and available data 2 1 the study area the upper aragón catchment is located in the central spanish pyrenees and it has an area of 2181 km2 see fig 1 the primary river of this catchment is the aragón river which starts at the astún valley in the north of the catchment at an altitude of 2600 m a s l the aragón river flows north south through the canfranc valley and then turns to the west in jaca downstream jaca the aragón river heads west until reaching the end of the catchment which coincides with the yesa reservoir the three main tributaries draining water to the catchment are subordán veral and esca within the domain of the catchment excluding the yesa reservoir located at the outlet there are no dams or reservoirs and consequently the river discharge follows a natural unmanaged regime the upper aragón catchment contains areas with limestone sandstone clay and marls the catchment altitude ranges between 2600 m a s l in the northernmost area and 500 m a s l at yesa reservoir the mean annual precipitation in the catchment is approximately 860 mm spring and autumn are the rainiest seasons summer is the driest season and it gets occasional storms due to convective processes the average daily temperature in the catchment is 12 c snow cover is found in high altitude above the 1500 m a s l from december to april lópez moreno and garcía ruiz 2004 vegetation cover in the catchment was strongly impacted by human activities historically cultivated areas were located below 1600 m a s l in the valley bottoms flat areas and steep south facing hillslopes which were managed even under shifting agriculture systems lasanta 1998 forests pinus sylvestris fagus sylvatica are located on the north facing slopes and everywhere between 1600 and 1800 m a s l between 1950 and 1960 most of the cultivated fields were abandoned with the exception of those located in the valley bottom the abandoned fields which represent around 25 of the catchment area faced a process of greenness and plant re colonization vicente serrano et al 2006 2 2 air temperature precipitation discharge and land cover datasets daily discharge time series data for the period 1956 2020 were obtained for six gauging stations aragón jaca subordán javierregay veral zuriza veral biniés esca sigüés and aragón yesa see fig 1 for the location and table 1 for the main characteristics of each cathment discharge data were measured for the study period through the float method and water level probes rating curves were created based on the measurements data was available from the ebro water authorities che https www chebro es daily precipitation for the six gauging stations and air temperature for the upper aragón catchment were obtained from the spanish national meteorological service agencia estatal de meteorología aemet further details about the processing methodology of this data set can be found in vicente serrano et al 2017 given the time scale analysis purposed in this study we use the climatic time series corresponding to the closest weather station to each gauging station land use and land cover maps for the decades of 1960s and 2010s were provided by the spanish ministry of agriculture based on interpreting aerial photographs and conducting fieldwork these maps were created at a spatial scale of 1 50 000 see fig 1 furthermore the normalized different vegetation index ndvi was used to infer consistent temporal vegetation growth and coverage dynamics ndvi was calculated at a spatial resolution of 1 1 km using the noaa avhrr images covering the period from 1982 to 2015 vicente serrano et al 2020 combined with modis ndvi huete et al 2002 for the period 2000 2020 both datasets were standardized using the reference period 2000 2015 in order to provide homogeneous series that are not affected by the change of satellites 3 methods 3 1 mann kendall test the mann kendall test is a classical statistical tool used in hydrological and climatic variables to assess whether a set of data values is increasing or decreasing over time and whether the trend in either direction is statistically significant autocorrelation was considered in the trend analysis this test was used with a twofold purpose i to detect significant long term trends in the database and ii to assess the impact of greenness and re vegetation processes on long term trends for two equally spaced periods 1956 1988 and 1989 2020 these two periods correspond to different vegetation levels the first period 1956 1988 corresponds to the early land abandonment process and further process of secondary succession of shrubs followed by trees a natural vegetation cover colonized most of the former cultivated fields which represent around 25 of the catchment area see vicente serrano et al 2006 furthermore slopes and terraces were afforested for economic and environmental purposes the second period 1989 2020 corresponds to a period with small changes in relation to the area of abandoned fields this period is characterized by a consolidation process of the greenness expansion triggered during previous years with well rooted and mature vegetation the surface occupied by mixed and broadleaf forests is significantly increased for the 1989 2020 period see fig 1 3 2 wavelet analysis air temperature precipitation and discharge time series are rarely stationary and they consist of a broad set of transient patterns varying within the temporal record the wavelet transform allows to localize in both time and periodicity the transient patterns recorded in such non stationary time series it thus provides a complete time scale representation of localized and transient phenomena occurring at different time scales torrence compo 1998 in this research we make use of the morlet wavelet which was successfully used in the past to analyze precipitation and discharge time series carey et al 2013 labat et al 2005 juez and nadal romero 2021 juez et al 2021 this wavelet type is characterized as 1 φ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e η 2 2 where φ 0 η is the wavelet function η is a dimensionless time parameter i is the imaginary unit and ω 0 is the dimensionless angular frequency taken as 6 which provides a right match between time and frequency localization thus for a time series xn for each scale s at all n of series length n the wavelet function is mathematically represented as 2 w n s n 0 n 1 x n ψ η η δ t s where wn s is the wavelet transform coefficients ψ the normalized wavelet the complex conjugate s the wavelet scale n the localized time index and n the translated time index of the time ordinate x it is possible to reconstruct the original signal by summing each time scale in addition to study the interaction between two time series we also compute a bivariate framework called squared wavelet coherence grinsted et al 2004 which compares two wavelet spectra corresponding to two time series the square wavelet coherence measures the local linear correlation between two time series x and y with wavelet transforms w n x s and w n y s at each time scale hence it is analogous to the squared correlation coefficient in linear regression because of these characteristics the squared wavelet coherence can identify regions in the time space where the examined time series co move but do not necessarily have a high common power we compute the squared wavelet coherence coefficients following the approach of grinsted et al 2004 3 r n 2 s s s 1 w n xy s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 being s a smoothing operator for both scale and time domain 4 s w s scale s time w n s where stime smooths along the time axis and sscale smooths along the scale axis the squared wavelet coherence coefficient is in the range 0 r n 2 s 1 values close to zero indicate weak correlation while values close to one provide evidence of strong correlation hence we discarded values where r n 2 s 0 5 to avoid non reliable estimations finally to complete the analysis the wavelet coherence phase difference is also computed to provide details on the oscillation cycles between two time series see lee and kim 2019 the phase difference is calculated as follows 5 ϕ n unknown template where im s w and re s w represent the imaginary and real part of s w respectively the phase differences are explained as the differences of both correlation and lagging relationships for example if the difference is zero the two time series are perfectly correlated and they move together values of phase difference in the interval 90 90 indicate the two time times are correlated values of phase difference between the interval 90 180 or between 90 180 indicate the two time series are anti correlated considering the correlation of our time series i e phase difference within the interval 90 90 the phase difference can be explained as the phase lagging negative values the first time series lags the second one or phase leading positive values the first time series leads the second one at specific time scales 4 results 4 1 temporal spectrum analysis precipitation patterns depict similar dynamics for the six catchment locations see fig 2 top rainiest seasons are spring march june and autumn october december discharge response patterns show similarities in temporal variability low flow during winter and summer and peak flow during late spring and differences in magnitude between gauging locations discharge records are lower at veral zuriza and veral biniés as these gauging stations are located at the headwaters and the drainage area is smaller conversely discharge records at aragón yesa are maximal because this downstream location drains water from the entire catchment fig 2 bottom displays the time series of air temperature for the river catchment an episodic pattern of increasing and decreasing temperature all through each year of the study period is observed fig 3 shows the corresponding global wavelet periodogram for precipitation discharge and air temperature time series local wavelet power is displayed in fig s1 of the supporting material this analysis allows to identify the non overlapping dominant time scales governing the temporal records based on the peaks with larger amplitude precipitation and discharge response features intra seasonal 0 003 0 5 years annual 1 year period short term annual 1 1 5 5 years and long term annual 5 5 20 years episodic patterns moreover the air temperature response features three dominant time scales related with annual 1 year period short term annual 1 1 5 5 years and long term annual 5 5 20 years episodic patterns in all the time series the annual cycle contains the dominant power furthermore there is also a strong variability around a time scale of 0 5 years for the precipitation and discharge time series this effect is further accentuated in the discharge response patterns where the time scale of 0 5 years peaks with higher power than in the precipitation response patterns the hydrological cycle of the aragón catchment is thus identified as a bi modal cycle with high flow seasons observed each year for two periods spring march june and autumn october december fig 4 displays the temporal scale by scale de composition of daily precipitation discharge and air temperature time series anomalies for the aragón jaca gauging station temporal anomalies for the other gauging stations are similar and are displayed in fig s2 of the supporting information for the sake of brevity the non overlapping time scale bands in fig 4 contain the major power peaks and are identified based on the global power spectra plotted in fig 3 positive and negative anomalies are calculated with respect to the mean values precipitation time series exhibit similar trends for the intraseasonal to seasonal short term and long term annual time scales differences are found in the annual time scales where it can be seen a slight decrease for the 1989 2020 period with respect to 1956 1988 period regarding the discharge time series for the annual and short term time scales a reduction in the magnitude of the anomalies are observed for the 1989 2020 period furthermore for the 1989 2020 period the short term annual time scale anomalies vary more slowly in a longer period of years and thus attenuate the contribution of the short term annual time scale in the discharge finally air temperature anomalies depict similar trends for all the time scales temporal dynamics of the upper aragón catchment are further analyzed by means of the percentage of changes computed for the 1956 2020 period see table 2 the increase in air temperature is observed all through the study period and it is statistically significant precipitation shows a slight decrease in all the gauging stations except in subordán javierregay where a subtle increase is observed these changes are not statistically significant in the majority of the gauging stations discharge shows a strong and statistically significant reduction in all the measuring stations except in veral zuriza where an important increase is recorded the strong discharge reduction ranging between 19 to 48 is not explained by the precipitation reduction ranging between 8 to 13 furthermore discharge reduction is more severe for the period 1956 1988 and for all the gauging stations specifically the highest discharge reduction is observed at aragón yesa this gauging station is located at the outlet of the river catchment and consequently amplifies any discharge change observed in the drainage area table 2 also shows the mean values for the 1956 1988 and 1989 2020 periods discharge shows a larger decline for the first time period decline ranging between 12 to 38 with regard to the second period decline ranging between 7 to 16 and with the exception of veral zuriza increase of 20 and 6 for the first and second period respectively table 3 displays the standard deviation change for precipitation discharge and air temperature time series for the 1956 1988 and 1989 2020 periods we used the standard deviation as a proxy to measure the magnitude of the anomalies in relation to the mean of the whole 1956 2020 period subsequently we computed the standard deviation change to assess any variability in other words any irregularity deviation between the two study periods an increase in the magnitude of the standard deviation i e more extreme values of precipitation is observed at the intraseasonal time scale for all the gauging stations furthermore looking at the mean values of the aragón catchment we observe higher standard deviation values for all the time scales for the 1989 2020 period this implies that anomalies in relation to the mean are more spread out and extreme events occurred more often discharge values show a decrease in the standard deviation values for the 1989 2020 period and for all the time scales the largest drop in the standard deviation values is noted for the intraseasonal and annual time scales lastly air temperature values show a slight increase in the standard deviation values for the intraseasonal values i e larger differences in temperature between winter and summer and a notable drop in the long term time scale i e a steady climatic trend is observed fig 5 displays the temporal evolution of the ndvi values computed for the upper aragón catchment and for the 1982 2020 period complete annual information before 1982 is not available as the first noaa avhrr satellite was launched in july 1981 ndvi shows a linear increase in parallel the standard deviation for each year was also computed and overlapped in the figure the standard deviation depicts a decline from 1986 to 1988 to 2020 4 2 significant wavelet coherence between hydro climatic time series the squared wavelet coherence between air temperature and discharge see fig 6 a displays strong wavelet coherence for seasonal and annual time scales before and after 1988 local squared wavelet coherence values are displayed in fig s3 this is not surprising given the high synchronicity in the annual dynamics of air temperature and resulting discharge high air temperatures during summer foster evaporation and water consumption by plants as a result available discharge is reduced in the whole catchment on the other hand the second period of study displays significant wavelet coherence for the long term time scale around 10 years this indicates that the dependency between years with abnormally high low air temperatures and discharge is accentuated for the 1989 2020 period conversely the squared wavelet coherence between precipitation and discharge see fig 6 b also shows strong wavelet coherence for seasonal and annual time scales before and after 1988 however a significant shift in the wavelet coherence is observed in the 3 12 years range for 1956 1988 the maximum peaks are clustered around time scales of 5 12 years range and for 1989 2020 the maximum peaks are clustered around time scales of 3 5 years range phase differences for the six gauging stations and for the two study periods are displayed in figs 7 and 8 air temperature and discharge time series see fig 7 are anti correlated for annual time scales phase difference interval between 180 90 which implies that as air temperature increases the discharge magnitude is reduced furthermore the 1989 2020 period shows two distinct trends with regard to the 1956 2020 period first looking at intraseasonal time scales at veral zuriza gauging station the discharge time series peaks before the air temperature time series second a delay between both time series is observed at short term time scales around 5 years the continuous and regular increase of air temperature for the study period around 1 2 c fosters the melting of traditionally perennial snow package located in the northernmost sector of the catchment and provides additional interannual discharge variability precipitation and discharge time series see fig 8 show a delay in discharge response with regard to precipitation for all the time scales conversely three notable differences are found between the two study periods one is that at intraseasonal time scales the delay between precipitation and discharge is larger for the 1989 2020 period the second point is that at annual time scales the delay between precipitation and discharge time series is slightly decreased in the 1989 2020 period in relation to the 1956 1988 period the last point is that while a certain level of variability is observed at time scales larger than 1 year for the 1956 1988 period those time scales show similar trends for the 1989 2020 period 5 discussion the analysis of long term data of precipitation air temperature and discharge time series is used to interpret the impacts of climate variability and generalized re vegetation and greenness observed at the upper aragón catchment in relation to discharge dynamics examination of the temporal structure of the datasets reveals dominant time scales accounting for seasonal annual short term annual and long term annual time scales the seasonal peaks around 0 5 years and annual time scales reflect a bi modal cycle with high flow seasons observed each year for two periods spring march june and autumn october december these characteristics of the yearly discharge distribution reflect that the upper aragón catchment follows mainly a precipitation hydrological regime with dry and wet periods but it is also partially modulated by the snow melting cycle of the headwaters in spring snow usually accumulates between december and april and it melts down during may lópez moreno et al 2013 lópez moreno et al 2020 the melting process of the winter snowpack notably contributes to the high flow season observed during late spring or early summer conversely the interannual time scales greater than1 year are mainly related to long term anomalies in the precipitation and flow events the role of these interannual time scales is of particular interest because their contribution fluctuates between transient periods of positive and negative values on the other hand magnitude and variability of the time series do not remain stationary and differences were found initially we computed the observed changes for the 1956 2020 period and we found that i air temperature was statistically significant increased in the catchment by 1 2 c ii precipitation rates were moderately and non statistically significant reduced ranging between 8 to 16 these precipitation trends are in agreement with observations over the western mediterranean region which are characterized by dominant internal variability of precipitation and non significant long term trends peña angulo et al 2020 and iii discharge values were strongly and statistically significant reduced ranging between 19 to 48 with the exception of veral zuriza this increase in discharge at veral zuriza the gauging station is located at a high elevation 1800 m ab s l in the northernmost part of the catchment and hence snow covers a larger percentage of the drained area see fig 1 is related with the increase of air temperature which favors the melting of snow package at the pyrenees and provides extra water resources to the river catchment vidaller et al 2021 the strong decline in discharge observed in the rest of the gauging stations cannot be attributed to drops in precipitation which are in a moderate reduction furthermore these discharge trends are in agreement with the trend observed in other natural non managed catchments in spain lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 martínez fernández et al 2013 vicente serrano et al 2020 in these studies authors attributed the decrease in water yield to the generalized greenness process as a result of land abandonment results herein outlined confirm that the increase of dense vegetation mixed and broadleaf forests corresponds with a decrease in discharge magnitude and also that precipitation trends play a secondary role in this discharge alteration non significant non statistically significant correlation and moderate alterations furthermore vegetation age may also affect the identified processes discharge reduction is more pronounced for the 1956 1988 period characterized by shrubs and young trees with regard to the 1989 2020 period characterized by mixed and broadleaf trees this is in agreement with previous studies which conclude that young forests consume more water than old growth forests delzon and loustau 2005 ellison et al 2017 teuling and hoek van dijke 2020 the importance of re vegetation and greenness on the available water resources in the aragón catchment is further stressed with the standard deviation change which is computed for the temporal anomalies before and after 1988 see table 3 increase of precipitation standard deviation is observed on average for the upper aragón catchment for all the time scales being the seasonal time scale the one with a larger increase around 15 in contrast larger reductions in the discharge standard deviation around 20 are observed for seasonal and annual time scales these reductions in the magnitude of discharge anomalies are related with the increasing modulating impact of the biophysical mechanisms of plants due to the increment of greenness see ndvi values in fig 5 during summer season water consumption by plants is increased and during winter season photosynthesis and transpiration processes by plants are reduced and so is the water consumption the increase of ndvi values runs in parallel to the intra annual ndvi standard deviation decline see fig 5 we thus show how the vegetation dynamics dominate the catchment discharge response at seasonal and annual time scales compared to the precipitation dynamics an additional interesting point about the differences in discharge dynamics before and after 1988 is the temporal shift in the wavelet coherence between precipitation and discharge time series at interannual time scales from the 5 12 years range 1956 1988 period to the 3 7 years range 1989 2020 as well as stronger coherence values for the 1989 2020 period see fig 6 b this different trend is explained based on two points one is that seasonal precipitation standard deviation change shows an increase for 1989 2020 around 15 see table 3 this precipitation standard deviation increase at seasonal time scales is linked to more severe and intermittent droughts vicente serrano et al 2014 the relevance of the seasonal timescales with regard to the available discharge is thus reduced which strengthens the importance of the inter annual time scales for the catchment discharge dynamics these inter annual time scales have the mission to recharge the water reserves of the catchment by which the discharge will be fed in the following years wang 2012 velasco et al 2017 juez and nadal romero 2020 the second point is that the greenness process observed all across the catchment has decreased the measured and visible discharge but it may have favored the groundwater discharge tree root architecture enhances hydraulic redistribution of water in soils prieto et al 2012 thereby old growth trees which correspond to the 1989 2020 period maximize groundwater recharge ilstedt et al 2016 wavelet coherence at inter annual time scales supports this point the catchment storage discharge cycle at inter annual time scales was reduced from the 5 12 years range 1956 1988 period to the 3 7 years range 1989 2020 in other words the temporal shift in the strong linear correlation between precipitation and discharge at inter annual time scales is due to the fact that water catchment reserves are filled in a shorter period of time phase difference response between precipitation and discharge time series see fig 8 is also a good proxy to understand the importance of vegetation on the catchment discharge at intraseasonal time scales the delay between precipitation and discharge is larger for the 1989 2020 period this is explained by the fact that the general re vegetation and greenness processes observed in the entire catchment modulate the response to precipitation van noordwijk et al 2016 plants especially tree roots enhance soil permeability keeler et al 2019 consequently infiltration processes are increased and resulting runoff is reduced this point helps to recharge groundwater and to mitigate floods grey et al 2018 furthermore at annual time scales the delay between precipitation and discharge time series is slightly decreased in the 1989 2020 period in relation to the 1956 1988 period this may indicate that re vegetation and greenness processes have favored the hydrological connectivity within the catchment trees improve soil structure and permeability channeling underground water miyata et al 2019 and ultimately have reduced the asynchrony between precipitation and discharge peaks the abandonment of cultivated areas in the upper aragón catchment resulted in the loss of the traditional rural mosaic with a more variable vegetation structure and lead to a process of greenness and plant re colonization which implies a more homogeneous landscape lasanta et al 2017 mantero et al 2020 looking at the phase difference response between precipitation and discharge time series in fig 8 we observe a remarkable homogenization trend for the 1989 2020 period with regard to the previous period and for all the study sites and time scales we thus believe that this markedly changes in the coupling between precipitation and discharge was owned by a process of vegetation homogenization in the whole catchment results herein described are in line with previous research on river headwaters in spain where a statistically significant discharge decline was observed during the last decades lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 martínez fernández et al 2013 therefore these results emphasize the need of implementing management policies for water limited environments such as the mountain areas in mediterranean regions traditional river catchment management is based on the capacity of water managers to meet water demand based on historical discharge patterns capon et al 2018 however projected climate and lulc scenarios in mediterranean catchments see garcía ruiz et al 2011 suggest i a continuous air temperature increase 1 6 c ii a decline in precipitations for the 21st century and iii an intense greenness processes with a significant upward shift of the upper treeline in most headwaters areas manrique alba et al 2022 this last point reveals critical in light of our results for this reason although water managers have no control on the climatic forces they can promote land management practices to reduce water consumption by vegetation in this regard silviculture practices such as clearing shrublands for livestock lasanta et al 2017 thinning to adapt dense stands of trees to available water resources manrique alba et al 2020 or uneven aged silviculture systems aszalós et al 2022 may be considered as needed tools for catchment management in mountain mediterranean areas 6 conclusions the temporal structure of concurrent air temperature precipitation and discharge time series at the upper aragón catchment was herein analyzed by means of the wavelet analysis the long term dataset combined with land cover maps and ndvi time series allow to explore the nature of discharge patterns and relate them to catchment and river processes occurring at different and non similar time scales in this catchment discharge experiences a dramatic drop in its magnitude for the study period and also changes in its temporal variability dynamics variability in climatic forces and lulc changes due to re vegetation and greenness are targeted as two possible explanations for this discharge decline the results illustrate that discharge reduction is mainly caused by the biophysical processes of plants with an increasing weight in shaping hydrological processes at catchment scale due to the greenness effect climatic fluctuations on the contrary play a secondary role and are only responsible of the partial decline in river discharge magnitude credit authorship contribution statement c juez

2783,soil hydraulic properties are essential for modeling and evaluating several soil water processes the use of pedotransfer functions ptfs is a viable alternative in the analysis of these processes due to the high costs or difficulty in measuring these properties we aimed to 1 examine the performance of a physically based ptf and a pool of empirical ptfs from both temperate and tropical climates to estimate soil water retention under subtropical climate and 2 performed correlation analysis between ptf inputs outputs and estimation residuals to help gain understanding why some ptfs are more successful than others in a given study area the study was carried out in the pelotas river watershed southern brazil where samples were taken at 100 locations in the 0 0 20 m soil layer along a 25 km spatial transect for each point clay silt fine sand total sand and organic carbon contents were measured along with bulk and particle density macro micro and total porosity and the soil water retention curve the ptfs were used to estimate field capacity permanent wilting point and the available water aw content the performance of ptfs from different climate zones was mixed and similarity in the data correlation structure between ptf development and application data sets appeared to be a good predictor of their predictive power there was no clear grouping in such correlation structures within climate zones and we conclude that the often claimed geoclimatic difference or similarity between an empirical ptf s origin and its application site is not or at least not the sole driver of a ptf s expected performance keywords pedotransfer functions soil hydraulic parameters soil water content transect sampling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil hydraulic properties such as saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and the water retention curve are key attributes in modeling hydrological processes at various scales romano and santini 1997 she et al 2017 they play a significant role in among others partitioning precipitation into infiltration and runoff controlling evaporation and water availability to plants and partitioning of latent and sensible heat grayson et al 1997 soil water retention measurements can also be used to help calibrate rainfall runoff models for watershed scale applications e g hu et al 2015 christanto et al 2019 the proper representation of soil water retention is recognized as a complex task at the watershed scale due to e g natural variability differences in land use differences in landscape position and eventually the practical restrictions to covering all that heterogeneity by sampling and monitoring information about the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves of soil units within watersheds is typically not easily available freitas et al 2019 pedotransfer functions ptfs have been growingly applied in recent decades van looy 2017 to estimate those soil properties in watersheds from available or easy to obtain legacy soil data but numerous challenges still remain while upscaling such point to point properties to the watershed scale bayabil et al 2019 guzman et al 2019 some simulation models concerned with the water balance use the soil water retention as input to solving the richards equation while others are built on the tipping bucket concept emerman 1995 turek et al 2018 that requires the input of water content at specific matric potentials such as field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp popular examples to the latter type models include but are not limited to e g the swat model arnold et al 1998 and the aquacrop model raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 which are used by many studies world wide ptfs that estimate water content at specific matric potentials and parameters of a fitted water retention equation have been termed point and parametric ptfs respectively van looy 2017 climate is recognized as one of the key drivers of soil formation one typical characteristic of tropical soils is the poorly represented silt fraction that is a result of prevailing weathering processes ehlen 2005 bétard 2012 the majority of empirical ptfs have been developed from soil data collected under temperate climatic conditions and when tested on tropical soils they showed limited success for example botula et al 2012 evaluated the performance of several published point and parametric ptfs derived from tropical and temperate soils to predict θ 33 kpa as an approximation of field capacity and θ 1 500 kpa as the value of permanent wilting point of soils in the lower congo and reported that the majority of examined point and parametric ptfs derived from tropical soils performed acceptably in the estimation process however they argued that errors may propagate and result in drawbacks e g weak water balance predictions when the ptfs are used to parameterize watershed models however other characteristics with less systematic differences can exist such as mineralogy and other physicochemical properties driven by differences in soil forming factors that may cause poor ptf performance both within and across climate zones minasny and hartemink 2011 given the distinctive temperature and precipitation patterns in the subtropics we have to assume that soils in the subtropics go through a different weathering process and therefore carry characteristical differences even if those may be less expressed and more difficult to generalize subtropics soils are typically shallower depths in some soil classes are sandier present less soil aggregation adequate water holding capacity soils with higher base saturation and higher cation exchange capacity cec as compared to tropical soils curi et al 2022 nebel et al 2010 assessed the applicability of eight point ptfs developed for tropical regions i e those of pidgeon 1972 lal 1979 arruda et al 1987 dijkerman 1988 bell and van keulen 1995 1996 oliveira et al 2002 peraza 2003 urach 2007 to estimate θ 33 kpa and θ 1 500 kpa for two brazilian lowland soils under subtropical climate and reported acceptable results on the other hand we found only one study in the literature that evaluated both temperate and tropical ptfs performance for soils under subtropical climate zou et al 2016 the authors evaluated two temperate parametric ptfs those by wösten et al 1999 li et al 2007 for an area in central china to estimate the parameters of van genuchten mualem model vgm they reported that both temperate ptfs overestimated vgm parameters for their soils and developed a parametric subtropical ptf to estimate the vgm parameters using soil bulk density bd texture geometric mean and standard deviation of the particle diameters as predictors these studies do not provide a clear enough message supported by a sufficient volume of research about ptf applicability for soils of the subtropics in brazil extended areas in the states of paraná santa catarina and rio grande do sul are under subtropical climate resende et al 2021 curi et al 2022 the pelotas river watershed prw is an important watershed in the southern part of rio grande do sul rs state in brazil under subtropical climate its main watercourse the pelotas river supplies drinking water for the ca 330 000 population of pelotas city beskow et al 2016 the watershed is prone to seasonal flooding and erosion by water soil compaction by grazing and agricultural machinery as well as soil and nutrient losses caused by other human activities leading to conflicts of interest and a multitude of social and economic issues the comprehension and quantification of hydrological and nutrient balance processes at the watershed scale e g surface and subsurface runoff water balance and sediment transport play a key role in providing science based decision support related to effects of soil and land use on stream flow and water quality in the watershed alvarenga et al 2016 mello et al 2019 such studies require appropriate parameterization of the soils hydraulic properties while little is known about the cross climate application of ptfs involving the subtropical climate zone therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to analyze the performance of several ptfs developed worldwide to estimate field capacity permanent wilting point and the amount of plant available water of soils in the subtropical pelotas river watershed and 2 to search for data patterns in the underlying data that may help better understand why a ptf performs well or fails in a given application area 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the pelotas river watershed prw is situated in southern rio grande do sul rs state brazil where the drainage area upstream is named ponte cordeiro de farias fig 1 prw has an area of about 370 km2 and its elevation ranges between 37 and 517 m based on the köppen classification the climate of the region is humid subtropical cfa with mean temperatures 23 2 c during the hottest month of the year kuinchtner and buriol 2001 the soils found in the prw are associations of hapludalf udorthent hapludalf hapludult udorthent and paleudult according to the us soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2014 further information about the climatic conditions and description of this study area can be found in article of she et al 2017 2 2 sampling locations and soil data a 25 km transect was established in the prw starting from the control point ponte cordeiro de farias pointing towards nw in order to cover the widest range of soil types that can be found in the watershed along the transect we identified one hundred sampling points spaced equidistantly i e by 250 m and logged their coordinates by gps we collected disturbed soil samples from the middle of the 0 20 cm soil layer at each sampling point to determine the particle density blake and hartge 1986 particle size distribution and soil texture according to the usda classification scheme combining the pipette method for the clay and silt fractions and wet sieving for the sand fraction gee and bauder 1986 the particle density ptd g cm 3 was measured using a pycnometer filled with 20 g of air dried soil and after that by filling it up to 50 ml with distilled water for removing all entrapped air we also quantified the soil organic carbon oc content using the wet combustion walkley black method and used the conversion factor of 1 724 nelson and sommers 1996 to approximate organic matter om content when om was required as a predictor by a ptf three undisturbed soil cores were collected at each point along the transect in the middle of the same soil layer using sampling rings of 5 cm id 3 cm h to determine soil bulk density bd after drying the material at 105 c the total porosity tp was calculated as tp 1 bd ptd for a given measured value of soil particle density ptd g cm 3 the soil water retention θ h data were measured at seven matric potentials i e at saturation putting sample rings on a scale after saturating them from below by capillary rise at 1 6 and 10 kpa using tension table and at 33 100 and 1 500 kpa using the pressure chamber apparatus klute 1986 similarly to many other studies e g armindo and wendroth 2016 ottoni filho et al 2016 turek et al 2020 we interpreted water retention at 33 kpa as field capacity fc and water retention at 1500 kpa as the permanent wilting point pwp which from hereon we refer to as θfc and θpwp respectively this choice was driven by these points being required as parameters by numerous models and therefore being used as dependent variables in point ptfs e g gupta and larson 1979 rawls et al 1982 aina and periaswamy 1985 arruda et al 1987 dijkerman 1988 bell and van keulen 1996 oliveira et al 2002 minasny and hartemink 2011 botula 2013 santos et al 2013 gunarathna et al 2019 and often further used to calculate the amount of available water aw in this study soil macroporosity ma was interpreted as the difference of θ 0 θ 6 kpa whereas and microporosity mi was equated with the of water held at θ 6 kpa dane et al 2002 2 3 parameterizing the soil water retention function the parameters of the van genuchten 1980 equation were fitted to the measured soil water retention θ h data pairs as 1 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n 1 1 n in which θ is volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 as a function of matric potential h kpa θs is the measured saturated water content cm3 cm 3 θr is the residual water content cm3 cm 3 and n and α kpa 1 are shape parameters to be fitted the swrc software version 3 0 beta dourado neto et al 2001 that uses least squares optimization was used to fit the θr n and α parameters where θr was constrained to be greater than zero 2 4 examined ptfs six ptfs were selected from the literature to estimate specific θ h data because they showed the best performance on the dataset in a previous analysis vereecken et al 1989 wösten et al 1999 schaap et al 2001 michelon et al 2010 obalum and obi 2012 barros et al 2013 we compared the performance of four parametric and two point ptfs which have been empirically derived from soils data from different climatic zones to estimate θfc and θpwp table 1 in addition the two options of the physically based hierarchical splintex 2 0 ptf1 model silva et al 2020 which requires only textural and bd information to predict the parameters of equation 1 was also examined i e simulation a sima that estimates parameters θr α and n and equates θs to tp and simulation b simb in which θs is also an estimated parameter along with θr α and n on the other hand the ptf2 of splintex 2 0 which was not evaluated in this study requires one or two measured θ h data pairs in addition to texture and bd information to improve the swrc prediction silva et al 2020 splintex 2 0 differs from empirical ptf models because it is a parametric ptf model applicable to any porous medium without requiring calibration when parametric ptfs were used θfc and θpwp were calculated from equation 1 after first estimating its parameters and aw a frequently used metric was subsequently calculated as aw θfc θpwp 2 5 statistical evaluation values of θfc θpwp and aw derived from measured and ptf estimated data were first evaluated using classical descriptive statistics normality of the data was assessed using the kolmogorov smirnov k s test at a 5 probability level the performance of ptfs was quantified using the coefficient of determination r2 and the accuracy of estimates was quantified by the mean error me and the root mean square error rmse each defined as 2 me 1 n i 1 n e i m i 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n e i m i 2 in which n is the number of sampling points and ei and mi are the estimated and measured data respectively the mean error is a directional metric that signals under or over estimation while rmse is a non directional metric of the uncertainty in the estimation the r software and the package agricolae version 4 3 1 was used to perform all calculations r core team 2019 we also performed a correlation analysis among the input output variables in the prw data and the data of and the obtained estimation residuals by the vereecken wösten rosetta and barros ptfs using pearson s r as metric 3 results and discussion 3 1 fitting of the van genuchten model table 2 presents the fitting statistics of the van genuchten model on average the model fitted the data at every measured matric potential with 1 vol fitting error at the same time the fits showed some sample to sample variation of up to or 5 vol at most matric potentials other than saturation or pwp upon manually checking these fits it is confirmed that larger deviations are rare and mostly occur as isolated cases i e one point per curve rather than as systematic misses of subsequent water retention points on the same curve 3 2 exploratory analysis of soil physical and hydraulic properties along the transect the measured textural fractions along the 25 km transect ranged between 35 7 and 91 6 of sand 4 6 21 3 fine sand 1 5 42 3 of silt and 6 5 32 5 of clay content which means the soils were dominantly coarse textured with a relatively high sand content being classified as sandy loam according to the usda texture class system bulk density particle density oc om content and the total porosity of samples collected along the 25 km transect presented small variability i e coefficient of variation cv 15 wilding and drees 1983 clay silt fine sand and sand content as well as microporosity exhibited moderate variability i e cv between 15 and 35 while macroporosity showed the highest variability among the examined soil properties cv 47 97 table 3 according to tests of skewness and kurtosis and confirmed by the kolmogorov smirnov test using the critical value 0 136 for p value 5 fine sand α and n were skewed towards higher values kurtosis between 3 02 and 19 46 while all the other attributes were normally distributed 3 3 estimation of the θ h points according to the me and rmse metrics table 4 only three ptfs namely the parametric temperate ptf by vereecken et al 1989 the parametric tropical 4 v ptf by barros et al 2013 and the point subtropical ptf by michelon et al 2010 provided reasonably good estimates of θfc with rmse values ranging from 0 055 to 0 064 cm3 cm 3 and an average absolute bias of 0 037 cm3 cm 3 or lower the remaining parametric ptfs presented strong bias i e an absolute value of me 0 1 and up to 0 16 cm3 cm 3 and therefore by definition also presented high rmse values this clear grouping in the estimation of θfc is notable regarding the estimation of θpwp a similar somewhat overlapping grouping was noticeable table 4 most ptfs yielded rmse values ranging from 0 051 to 0 064 cm3 cm 3 and an average absolute bias of 0 04 cm3 cm 3 or lower notable exceptions were the michelon et al 2010 ptfs and the two tested splintex ptf1s which yielded substantially greater rmses and absolute mes 0 089 to 0 153 and 0 08 to 0 14 cm3 cm 3 respectively no single statistic will fully describe a ptf s performance hence we looked further into statistical metrics beyond those customary in the ptf literature as proposed by turek et al 2018 ptfs essentially behave like interpolation tools and tend to smoothen the data i e estimates typically return a narrower range or smaller cv than the experimental data they are tested on this was confirmed for most ptfs when tested on the prw data table 5 in general the estimated minimum maximum range was narrower and the cv of estimates for the data population was smaller than those of the original measurements the splintex 2 0 ptf1 did not produce this phenomenon since the presented cvs were greater than the cv of the measured data in three out of four cases because splintex is based on physical equations that transfer particle size distribution information into pore size distribution the large texture and bd variation yielded a large cv of the water content data as well at the same time the minimum maximum range of their estimates was the narrowest among all ptfs which when combined with some of the largest estimation biases c f table 4 suggests that the applicability of the texture bd based options of the splintex 2 0 ptf to the prw data is limited other notable underperformances shown by data in tables 4 and 5 are the systematic overprediction of θfc by rosetta and the wösten et al 1999 and obalum and obi 2012 ptfs that shift the entire range of data the shift quantified by the me metric is further amplified by the misjudgment misprediction of low fc values by as much as 15 20 volumetric c f column min in table 5 the range and cv of predicted θfc and θpwp also signaled the relative success of the vereecken et al 1989 and the barros et al 2013 ptfs as well as the michelon and carlesso 2010 ptf to some extent there did not appear to be any systematic advantage to point or parametric ptfs or by their climatic origin meaning that climate as a driver of soil formation alone does not seem to determine the expected performance of ptfs it is also noted that the size of the database behind a ptf or the breadth of soil coverage did not appear to be key factors either given their mixed performance similarities in textural range and patterns are often argued to be the determinant of a ptfs success or lack of for soils of a particular region van looy 2017 reis et al 2018 in this study it also appears that the basic textural coverage of samples underneath the most successful vereecken et al 1989 and barros et al 2013 ptfs somewhat resemble that of the prw data set the vereecken et al 1989 ptfs were derived from a data set whose clay content ranged from 0 to 54 5 and sand content ranged from 5 6 to 97 8 and the data set underlying the tropical ptf of barros et al 2013 had clay content ranging from 6 to 54 2 and sand content ranging from 24 9 to 94 5 however the rosetta and wösten et al 1999 ptfs are also based on a broad range of soils and they proved to be ineffective ptfs for prw we argue that while textural similarities and coverage are necessary conditions to help limit extrapolations to textures that are not covered by a particular ptf it is also necessary while rarely looked into that development and application data sets present similar correlation patterns among the underlying variables 3 4 correlation patterns as potential drivers of ptf performance the results presented a mixed picture when it comes to the performance of temperate and tropical climate ptfs it is often found that temperate climate ptfs will not work for soils in the tropics and vice versa and it is commonly concluded that it is the geographical source area or the range and of the data in the underlying database that will determine whether a ptf will perform well for an area or not while we accept that generally speaking geography is a key factor given that it is an umbrella proxy to climatic and other soil forming factors we argue that this alone cannot be an explanation to a ptf s performance for example in our study the frequently used rosetta wösten and vereecken ptfs have strong overlaps in terms of the data source area the general climatic conditions and the covered data range but they performed very differently when being evaluated on the pelotas river data set the vereecken ptf performed rather well in estimating fc with low rmse and bias but presented relatively strong bias when estimating pwp despite its rmse being among the best the wösten and rosetta ptfs however performed particularly weakly in estimating fc while the wösten ptf was the best predictor of pwp for the pelotas data set among all examined ptfs the picture is rather mixed among the temperate ptfs and we argue that it is not the geographical source area that encodes whether a ptf will perform well but rather the correlation structure in the data set and its degree of similarity to the same in the application data set we promote the view that an empirical ptf is essentially a generalization of the data correlation structure in the underlying data and while a derived ptf is not in direct relationship with the underlying data correlations the latter are likely indicative of sources of estimation errors and biases nemes et al 2005 demonstrated how some of the databases behind some popular ptfs may differ in terms of such correlations despite being large and comprehensive databases that cover soils of similar climatic zones in order to look into this we have contacted the authors of the vereecken wösten rosetta and barros ptfs and have generated data statistics and correlation tables between the most common basic soil properties used in ptfs sand silt and clay content bd and oc and the two soil water retention points that are estimated in this study fc 33 kpa and pwp 1 500 kpa we note that some of the ptfs estimate parameters of equation 1 in which case we generated the two individual water retention points from the water retention curves both the basic data statistics in table 6 and the scatter plot of particle size distributions in the 5 data sets fig 2 clearly show that the data range of the pelotas data set is covered by each of the data sets behind the 4 closely examined ptfs it is only the vereecken data set whose data cloud does not clearly cover the cloud of the pelotas data set s textural distribution the other 3 data sets fully overlap with the pelotas set although their mean and median points are not necessarily close to each other in that sense all three temperate data sets have a less sandy and more silty data population where the deviation between medians amounts to 10 20 table 7 shows the correlation structure of 5 basic inputs and the two outputs for each of the databases underlying the vereecken wösten rosetta and barros ptfs and the pelotas river watershed data set small differences are common and many patterns are rather similar which is not very surprising since for example sand content is typically in negative relationship with silt and clay content given that particle and pore size distribution are typically strongly correlated sand content has a negative relationship with water retention at both determined points while those are positively correlated with silt and clay contents however some notable differences emerge upon examining the correlations involving bd and oc contents table 7 it is notable for instance that in the pelotas data set the oc content is in intermediately strong negative correlation with sand content and that it is in positive relationship with clay and silt content in all other data sets however oc s relationship with the textural fractions is either negligible or shows weak correlation with the textural fractions in the opposite direction to a differing degree among the databases but bulk density and oc are in a negative relationship with each other which is likely a result of oc s positive effect on soil aggregation as well as its lighter dry bulk density than that of mineral particles which has generally been recognized in soil science bulk density however has a distinctly different correlation with fc and pwp in the different data sets in the pelotas river barros and vereecken data sets bd is weakly or not correlated with fc whereas in the wösten and rosetta data sets they are intermediately strongly correlated with each other table 7 in the latter two data sets wösten and rosetta bd also shows the strongest correlations with the textural fractions which the other data sets do not show we argue that it is likely that these play a significant role when estimating fc but not necessarily when estimating pwp bulk density is expected to play a role as an influential predictor in the wet ter range of the swrc where structural and mid sized pores hold a significant amount of water if a developed empirical ptf negatively connects bd and fc as in the wösten and rosetta data sets it is likely to lead to errors and partial bias when that ptf is applied to another data set that shows literally no correlation between those variables the wösten and rosetta ptfs yielded strongly biased estimates of fc with high rmse and table 8 confirms that the residuals obtained after estimating fc by the wösten and rosetta ptfs are in a relatively strong correlation with bd the strongest among the observed correlations for any model and any input i e r 0 52 and 0 54 respectively there are substantial differences in the correlations between bd and pwp among the databases as well table 7 but this likely has less influence on those estimates since bd is not considered to be an influential factor on water held at pwp in fact pwp measurements typically take place using disturbed soil samples i e the original measurements ignore soil bd as a factor and only use that information when converting the gravimetric measurements to be expressed in volume percent another notable trend according to table 8 is that for both the fc and pwp estimations all four of the ptf models examined in detail present a notable to intermediately strong negative relationship between silt content and the estimation errors we argue that since there is not very much variability in the silt contents in the pelotas data set over 90 of data falls between 10 and 30 fig 2 this variable does not have much information content towards controlling soil water retention the barros and vereecken data sets show a similarly narrow distribution of silt contents fig 2 that likely lead to the more successful estimation of fc and less estimation bias controlled by silt content table 8 at the same time the residuals correlation with silt content is notably stronger for the wösten and rosetta fc estimates which likely contributed to the observed biased estimation of fc by these ptfs we also note that silt content has a more significant role in determining soil pwp and it is the vereecken and rosetta models that presented the largest residuals silt content correlation for pwp table 8 while those were the two models that predicted pwp with the greatest bias and poorest rmse among the four models we note that among the examined correlation patterns in the data available to us we could not identify notable groupings according to the climate source of the source data at the same time the two best performing ptfs were developed using data of two different climate zones we argue that the type of analysis of the underlying data and the estimation residuals provides useful information towards developing understanding why different ptfs perform differently for an independent data set this can in some cases be combined with a discussion of differences in soil forming factors but that was beyond the scope of this paper given that details such as the source areas or prevailing land use represented by the data in the international data sets are mostly unknown of course such correlation and residual analyses do not negate the need to examine the range and density of data in the underlying data sets since extrapolations beyond the original data range should generally be avoided however extrapolations did not occur in any of the cases examined here 3 5 estimation of aw while fc and pwp represent thresholds at which certain model processes are triggered e g leaching to deeper layers reduced evapotranspiration crop wilting etc aw calculated as their difference is also of relevance a reduction or increase to this metric will translate to more or less water being redistributed in the soil profile and being available for the crop and in turn plays a significant role in e g under or overestimating biomass production or the start of crop senescence therefore it is desirable that the ptf based estimation of that metric is also analyzed as a further criterion when the fc and pwp estimations in this study are paired for prw and aw estimates are plotted against those based on measurements several things are notable one general observation is that the ptfs typically do not return the range visible in measured aw this is expectable due to aw being a product of two already somewhat smoothed estimates i e fc and pwp in some cases as e g with the splintex ptf1 a or rosetta ptfs this phenomenon is rather observable while the michelon and carlesso 2010 and splintex ptf1 b models present a rather broadly distributed albeit biased aw estimation fig 3 second several ptfs produce strongly biased estimates of aw most notably the rosetta the wösten et al 1999 obalum and obi 2012 and michelon and carlesso 2010 ptfs both fc and pwp estimations are already error loaded which will superimpose when the two estimates are deducted from each other aw is typically difficult to estimate both directly and indirectly via fc and pwp because it represents a portion of the water retention curve whose two boundaries i e abundance and connectedness of pore sizes at fc and at pwp are dominantly controlled by different soil properties and variable interactions that independent data sets may not be able to reproduce as a result in our study the smoothened and often biased aw estimates show very weak correlation with measured aw as witnessed by the unacceptably low r2 values in fig 3 r2 ranging from 0 001 to 0 136 with only the barros et al 2013 model s r2 exceeding 0 045 several other studies have also reported low success in estimating aw by ptfs e g tomasella and hodnett 2004 patil et al 2010 wang et al 2012 da costa et al 2013 and silva et al 2017 therefore while there is a need and desire to parameterize field to watershed scale modeling studies users of ptfs are cautioned about the lack of ptf performance that often remains hidden due to lack of critical testing the significance of misjudging fc is mostly in how much excess water by precipitation irrigation or snow melt is routed further i e runoff vs infiltration and redistribution however if the direction of biases in estimating fc and pwp were similar and the true fc pwp difference was estimated acceptably well by a ptf simulated biomass production estimates could be more correct for a location compared to using other ptfs that do not meet that same criterion based on the obtained data in our study there is significant risk that despite the vereecken et al 1989 and barros et al 2013 models presenting the best statistical metrics their use to parameterize a crop model for prw that relies on the fc pwp aw concept should still be approached critically and monitored closely against field trials 4 conclusions in this study parametric and point ptfs calibrated with temperate and tropical soil data along with a physically based ptf were used to estimate θ 33 kpa and θ 1 500 kpa values over a 25 km transect in the subtropical pelotas river watershed prw and evaluate their product aw as fc minus pwp that is a key input to a number of crop growth or water management models used in decision support we expand standard ptf evaluation by performing variable and estimation residual correlation analysis in order to gain deeper understanding why a ptf may do well or fail in a given application area therefore we have examined variable correlations in several data sets behind popular empirical ptfs rosetta wösten vereecken and barros ptfs and in the prw data and managed to establish logical arguments between similarities and differences among variable correlations and each ptf s performance while the presented evidence is not exclusive we argue that the often claimed geo climatic difference or similarity between a ptf s origin and its application site is not or at least not the sole driver of a ptf s expected performance other conditions need to be fulfilled that appear to be explainable or at least observable from the underlying data finally we demonstrated how the databases that served as data sources to ptfs may differ in terms of such correlations despite being large and comprehensive databases that cover soils of similar climatic zones our results provide useful information to the reader towards understanding why different ptfs perform differently when applied to an independent data set and should stimulate similar analyses that help establish to what extent these findings can be generalized funding this work was supported by the brazilian national council for scientific and

2783,soil hydraulic properties are essential for modeling and evaluating several soil water processes the use of pedotransfer functions ptfs is a viable alternative in the analysis of these processes due to the high costs or difficulty in measuring these properties we aimed to 1 examine the performance of a physically based ptf and a pool of empirical ptfs from both temperate and tropical climates to estimate soil water retention under subtropical climate and 2 performed correlation analysis between ptf inputs outputs and estimation residuals to help gain understanding why some ptfs are more successful than others in a given study area the study was carried out in the pelotas river watershed southern brazil where samples were taken at 100 locations in the 0 0 20 m soil layer along a 25 km spatial transect for each point clay silt fine sand total sand and organic carbon contents were measured along with bulk and particle density macro micro and total porosity and the soil water retention curve the ptfs were used to estimate field capacity permanent wilting point and the available water aw content the performance of ptfs from different climate zones was mixed and similarity in the data correlation structure between ptf development and application data sets appeared to be a good predictor of their predictive power there was no clear grouping in such correlation structures within climate zones and we conclude that the often claimed geoclimatic difference or similarity between an empirical ptf s origin and its application site is not or at least not the sole driver of a ptf s expected performance keywords pedotransfer functions soil hydraulic parameters soil water content transect sampling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil hydraulic properties such as saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and the water retention curve are key attributes in modeling hydrological processes at various scales romano and santini 1997 she et al 2017 they play a significant role in among others partitioning precipitation into infiltration and runoff controlling evaporation and water availability to plants and partitioning of latent and sensible heat grayson et al 1997 soil water retention measurements can also be used to help calibrate rainfall runoff models for watershed scale applications e g hu et al 2015 christanto et al 2019 the proper representation of soil water retention is recognized as a complex task at the watershed scale due to e g natural variability differences in land use differences in landscape position and eventually the practical restrictions to covering all that heterogeneity by sampling and monitoring information about the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves of soil units within watersheds is typically not easily available freitas et al 2019 pedotransfer functions ptfs have been growingly applied in recent decades van looy 2017 to estimate those soil properties in watersheds from available or easy to obtain legacy soil data but numerous challenges still remain while upscaling such point to point properties to the watershed scale bayabil et al 2019 guzman et al 2019 some simulation models concerned with the water balance use the soil water retention as input to solving the richards equation while others are built on the tipping bucket concept emerman 1995 turek et al 2018 that requires the input of water content at specific matric potentials such as field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp popular examples to the latter type models include but are not limited to e g the swat model arnold et al 1998 and the aquacrop model raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 which are used by many studies world wide ptfs that estimate water content at specific matric potentials and parameters of a fitted water retention equation have been termed point and parametric ptfs respectively van looy 2017 climate is recognized as one of the key drivers of soil formation one typical characteristic of tropical soils is the poorly represented silt fraction that is a result of prevailing weathering processes ehlen 2005 bétard 2012 the majority of empirical ptfs have been developed from soil data collected under temperate climatic conditions and when tested on tropical soils they showed limited success for example botula et al 2012 evaluated the performance of several published point and parametric ptfs derived from tropical and temperate soils to predict θ 33 kpa as an approximation of field capacity and θ 1 500 kpa as the value of permanent wilting point of soils in the lower congo and reported that the majority of examined point and parametric ptfs derived from tropical soils performed acceptably in the estimation process however they argued that errors may propagate and result in drawbacks e g weak water balance predictions when the ptfs are used to parameterize watershed models however other characteristics with less systematic differences can exist such as mineralogy and other physicochemical properties driven by differences in soil forming factors that may cause poor ptf performance both within and across climate zones minasny and hartemink 2011 given the distinctive temperature and precipitation patterns in the subtropics we have to assume that soils in the subtropics go through a different weathering process and therefore carry characteristical differences even if those may be less expressed and more difficult to generalize subtropics soils are typically shallower depths in some soil classes are sandier present less soil aggregation adequate water holding capacity soils with higher base saturation and higher cation exchange capacity cec as compared to tropical soils curi et al 2022 nebel et al 2010

peraza 2003 urach 2007 to estimate θ 33 kpa and θ 1 500 kpa for two brazilian lowland soils under subtropical climate and reported acceptable results on the other hand we found only one study in the literature that evaluated both temperate and tropical ptfs performance for soils under subtropical climate zou et al 2016 the authors evaluated two temperate parametric ptfs those by wösten et al 1999 li et al 2007 for an area in central china to estimate the parameters of van genuchten mualem model vgm they reported that both temperate ptfs overestimated vgm parameters for their soils and developed a parametric subtropical ptf to estimate the vgm parameters using soil bulk density bd texture geometric mean and standard deviation of the particle diameters as predictors these studies do not provide a clear enough message supported by a sufficient volume of research about ptf applicability for soils of the subtropics in brazil extended areas in the states of paraná santa catarina and rio grande do sul are under subtropical climate resende et al 2021 curi et al 2022 the pelotas river watershed prw is an important watershed in the southern part of rio grande do sul rs state in brazil under subtropical climate its main watercourse the pelotas river supplies drinking water for the ca 330 000 population of pelotas city beskow et al 2016 the watershed is prone to seasonal flooding and erosion by water soil compaction by grazing and agricultural machinery as well as soil and nutrient losses caused by other human activities leading to conflicts of interest and a multitude of social and economic issues the comprehension and quantification of hydrological and nutrient balance processes at the watershed scale e g surface and subsurface runoff water balance and sediment transport play a key role in providing science based decision support related to effects of soil and land use on stream flow and water quality in the watershed alvarenga et al 2016 mello et al 2019 such studies require appropriate parameterization of the soils hydraulic properties while little is known about the cross climate application of ptfs involving the subtropical climate zone therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to analyze the performance of several ptfs developed worldwide to estimate field capacity permanent wilting point and the amount of plant available water of soils in the subtropical pelotas river watershed and 2 to search for data patterns in the underlying data that may help better understand why a ptf performs well or fails in a given application area 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the pelotas river watershed prw is situated in southern rio grande do sul rs state brazil where the drainage area upstream is named ponte cordeiro de farias fig 1 prw has an area of about 370 km2 and its elevation ranges between 37 and 517 m based on the köppen classification the climate of the region is humid subtropical cfa with mean temperatures 23 2 c during the hottest month of the year kuinchtner and buriol 2001 the soils found in the prw are associations of hapludalf udorthent hapludalf hapludult udorthent and paleudult according to the us soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2014 further information about the climatic conditions and description of this study area can be found in article of she et al 2017 2 2 sampling locations and soil data a 25 km transect was established in the prw starting from the control point ponte cordeiro de farias pointing towards nw in order to cover the widest range of soil types that can be found in the watershed along the transect we identified one hundred sampling points spaced equidistantly i e by 250 m and logged their coordinates by gps we collected disturbed soil samples from the middle of the 0 20 cm soil layer at each sampling point to determine the particle density blake and hartge 1986 particle size distribution and soil texture according to the usda classification scheme combining the pipette method for the clay and silt fractions and wet sieving for the sand fraction gee and bauder 1986 the particle density ptd g cm 3 was measured using a pycnometer filled with 20 g of air dried soil and after that by filling it up to 50 ml with distilled water for removing all entrapped air we also quantified the soil organic carbon oc content using the wet combustion walkley black method and used the conversion factor of 1 724 nelson and sommers 1996 to approximate organic matter om content when om was required as a predictor by a ptf three undisturbed soil cores were collected at each point along the transect in the middle of the same soil layer using sampling rings of 5 cm id 3 cm h to determine soil bulk density bd after drying the material at 105 c the total porosity tp was calculated as tp 1 bd ptd for a given measured value of soil particle density ptd g cm 3 the soil water retention θ h data were measured at seven matric potentials i e at saturation putting sample rings on a scale after saturating them from below by capillary rise at 1 6 and 10 kpa using tension table and at 33 100 and 1 500 kpa using the pressure chamber apparatus klute 1986 similarly to many other studies e g armindo and wendroth 2016 ottoni filho et al 2016 turek et al 2020 we interpreted water retention at 33 kpa as field capacity fc and water retention at 1500 kpa as the permanent wilting point pwp which from hereon we refer to as θfc and θpwp respectively this choice was driven by these points being required as parameters by numerous models and therefore being used as dependent variables in point ptfs e g gupta and larson 1979 rawls et al 1982 aina and periaswamy 1985 arruda et al 1987 dijkerman 1988 bell and van keulen 1996 oliveira et al 2002 minasny and hartemink 2011 botula 2013 santos et al 2013 gunarathna et al 2019 and often further used to calculate the amount of available water aw in this study soil macroporosity ma was interpreted as the difference of θ 0 θ 6 kpa whereas and microporosity mi was equated with the of water held at θ 6 kpa dane et al 2002 2 3 parameterizing the soil water retention function the parameters of the van genuchten 1980 equation were fitted to the measured soil water retention θ h data pairs as 1 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n 1 1 n in which θ is volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 as a function of matric potential h kpa θs is the measured saturated water content cm3 cm 3 θr is the residual water content cm3 cm 3 and n and α kpa 1 are shape parameters to be fitted the swrc software version 3 0 beta dourado neto et al 2001 that uses least squares optimization was used to fit the θr n and α parameters where θr was constrained to be greater than zero 2 4 examined ptfs six ptfs were selected from the literature to estimate specific θ h data because they showed the best performance on the dataset in a previous analysis vereecken et al 1989 wösten et al 1999 schaap et al 2001 michelon et al 2010 obalum and obi 2012 barros et al 2013 we compared the performance of four parametric and two point ptfs which have been empirically derived from soils data from different climatic zones to estimate θfc and θpwp table 1 in addition the two options of the physically based hierarchical splintex 2 0 ptf1 model silva et al 2020 which requires only textural and bd information to predict the parameters of equation 1 was also examined i e simulation a sima that estimates parameters θr α and n and equates θs to tp and simulation b simb in which θs is also an estimated parameter along with θr α and n on the other hand the ptf2 of splintex 2 0 which was not evaluated in this study requires one or two measured θ h data pairs in addition to texture and bd information to improve the swrc prediction silva et al 2020 splintex 2 0 differs from empirical ptf models because it is a parametric ptf model applicable to any porous medium without requiring calibration when parametric ptfs were used θfc and θpwp were calculated from equation 1 after first estimating its parameters and aw a frequently used metric was subsequently calculated as aw θfc θpwp 2 5 statistical evaluation values of θfc θpwp and aw derived from measured and ptf estimated data were first evaluated using classical descriptive statistics normality of the data was assessed using the kolmogorov smirnov k s test at a 5 probability level the performance of ptfs was quantified using the coefficient of determination r2 and the accuracy of estimates was quantified by the mean error me and the root mean square error rmse each defined as 2 me 1 n i 1 n e i m i 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n e i m i 2 in which n is the number of sampling points and ei and mi are the estimated and measured data respectively the mean error is a directional metric that signals under or over estimation while rmse is a non directional metric of the uncertainty in the estimation the r software and the package agricolae version 4 3 1 was used to perform all calculations r core team 2019 we also performed a correlation analysis among the input output variables in the prw data and the data of and the obtained estimation residuals by the vereecken wösten rosetta and barros ptfs using pearson s r as metric 3 results and discussion 3 1 fitting of the van genuchten model table 2 presents the fitting statistics of the van genuchten model on average the model fitted the data at every measured matric potential with 1 vol fitting error at the same time the fits showed some sample to sample variation of up to or 5 vol at most matric potentials other than saturation or pwp upon manually checking these fits it is confirmed that larger deviations are rare and mostly occur as isolated cases i e one point per curve rather than as systematic misses of subsequent water retention points on the same curve 3 2 exploratory analysis of soil physical and hydraulic properties along the transect the measured textural fractions along the 25 km transect ranged between 35 7 and 91 6 of sand 4 6 21 3 fine sand 1 5 42 3 of silt and 6 5 32 5 of clay content which means the soils were dominantly coarse textured with a relatively high sand content being classified as sandy loam according to the usda texture class system bulk density particle density oc om content and the total porosity of samples collected along the 25 km transect presented small variability i e coefficient of variation cv 15 wilding and drees 1983 clay silt fine sand and sand content as well as microporosity exhibited moderate variability i e cv between 15 and 35 while macroporosity showed the highest variability among the examined soil properties cv 47 97 table 3 according to tests of skewness and kurtosis and confirmed by the kolmogorov smirnov test using the critical value 0 136 for p value 5 fine sand α and n were skewed towards higher values kurtosis between 3 02 and 19 46 while all the other attributes were normally distributed 3 3 estimation of the θ h points according to the me and rmse metrics table 4 only three ptfs namely the parametric temperate ptf by vereecken et al 1989 the parametric tropical 4 v ptf by barros et al 2013 and the point subtropical ptf by michelon et al 2010 provided reasonably good estimates of θfc with rmse values ranging from 0 055 to 0 064 cm3 cm 3 and an average absolute bias of 0 037 cm3 cm 3 or lower the remaining parametric ptfs presented strong bias i e an absolute value of me 0 1 and up to 0 16 cm3 cm 3 and therefore by definition also presented high rmse values this clear grouping in the estimation of θfc is notable regarding the estimation of θpwp a similar somewhat overlapping grouping was noticeable table 4 most ptfs yielded rmse values ranging from 0 051 to 0 064 cm3 cm 3 and an average absolute bias of 0 04 cm3 cm 3 or lower notable exceptions were the michelon et al 2010 ptfs and the two tested splintex ptf1s which yielded substantially greater rmses and absolute mes 0 089 to 0 153 and 0 08 to 0 14 cm3 cm 3 respectively no single statistic will fully describe a ptf s performance hence we looked further into statistical metrics beyond those customary in the ptf literature as proposed by turek et al 2018 ptfs essentially behave like interpolation tools and tend to smoothen the data i e estimates typically return a narrower range or smaller cv than the experimental data they are tested on this was confirmed for most ptfs when tested on the prw data table 5 in general the estimated minimum maximum range was narrower and the cv of estimates for the data population was smaller than those of the original measurements the splintex 2 0 ptf1 did not produce this phenomenon since the presented cvs were greater than the cv of the measured data in three out of four cases because splintex is based on physical equations that transfer particle size distribution information into pore size distribution the large texture and bd variation yielded a large cv of the water content data as well at the same time the minimum maximum range of their estimates was the narrowest among all ptfs which when combined with some of the largest estimation biases c f table 4 suggests that the applicability of the texture bd based options of the splintex 2 0 ptf to the prw data is limited other notable underperformances shown by data in tables 4 and 5 are the systematic overprediction of θfc by rosetta and the wösten et al 1999 and obalum and obi 2012 ptfs that shift the entire range of data the shift quantified by the me metric is further amplified by the misjudgment misprediction of low fc values by as much as 15 20 volumetric c f column min in table 5 the range and cv of predicted θfc and θpwp also signaled the relative success of the vereecken et al 1989 and the barros et al 2013 ptfs as well as the michelon and carlesso 2010 ptf to some extent there did not appear to be any systematic advantage to point or parametric ptfs or by their climatic origin meaning that climate as a driver of soil formation alone does not seem to determine the expected performance of ptfs it is also noted that the size of the database behind a ptf or the breadth of soil coverage did not appear to be key factors either given their mixed performance similarities in textural range and patterns are often argued to be the determinant of a ptfs success or lack of for soils of a particular region van looy 2017 reis et al 2018 in this study it also appears that the basic textural coverage of samples underneath the most successful vereecken et al 1989 and barros et al 2013 ptfs somewhat resemble that of the prw data set the vereecken et al 1989 ptfs were derived from a data set whose clay content ranged from 0 to 54 5 and sand content ranged from 5 6 to 97 8 and the data set underlying the tropical ptf of barros et al 2013 had clay content ranging from 6 to 54 2 and sand content ranging from 24 9 to 94 5 however the rosetta and wösten et al 1999 ptfs are also based on a broad range of soils and they proved to be ineffective ptfs for prw we argue that while textural similarities and coverage are necessary conditions to help limit extrapolations to textures that are not covered by a particular ptf it is also necessary while rarely looked into that development and application data sets present similar correlation patterns among the underlying variables 3 4 correlation patterns as potential drivers of ptf performance the results presented a mixed picture when it comes to the performance of temperate and tropical climate ptfs it is often found that temperate climate ptfs will not work for soils in the tropics and vice versa and it is commonly concluded that it is the geographical source area or the range and of the data in the underlying database that will determine whether a ptf will perform well for an area or not while we accept that generally speaking geography is a key factor given that it is an umbrella proxy to climatic and other soil forming factors we argue that this alone cannot be an explanation to a ptf s performance for example in our study the frequently used rosetta wösten and vereecken ptfs have strong overlaps in terms of the data source area the general climatic conditions and the covered data range but they performed very differently when being evaluated on the pelotas river data set the vereecken ptf performed rather well in estimating fc with low rmse and bias but presented relatively strong bias when estimating pwp despite its rmse being among the best the wösten and rosetta ptfs however performed particularly weakly in estimating fc while the wösten ptf was the best predictor of pwp for the pelotas data set among all examined ptfs the picture is rather mixed among the temperate ptfs and we argue that it is not the geographical source area that encodes whether a ptf will perform well but rather the correlation structure in the data set and its degree of similarity to the same in the application data set we promote the view that an empirical ptf is essentially a generalization of the data correlation structure in the underlying data and while a derived ptf is not in direct relationship with the underlying data correlations the latter are likely indicative of sources of estimation errors and biases nemes et al 2005 demonstrated how some of the databases behind some popular ptfs may differ in terms of such correlations despite being large and comprehensive databases that cover soils of similar climatic zones in order to look into this we have contacted the authors of the vereecken wösten rosetta and barros ptfs and have generated data statistics and correlation tables between the most common basic soil properties used in ptfs sand silt and clay content bd and oc and the two soil water retention points that are estimated in this study fc 33 kpa and pwp 1 500 kpa we note that some of the ptfs estimate parameters of equation 1 in which case we generated the two individual water retention points from the water retention curves both the basic data statistics in table 6 and the scatter plot of particle size distributions in the 5 data sets fig 2 clearly show that the data range of the pelotas data set is covered by each of the data sets behind the 4 closely examined ptfs it is only the vereecken data set whose data cloud does not clearly cover the cloud of the pelotas data set s textural distribution the other 3 data sets fully overlap with the pelotas set although their mean and median points are not necessarily close to each other in that sense all three temperate data sets have a less sandy and more silty data population where the deviation between medians amounts to 10 20 table 7 shows the correlation structure of 5 basic inputs and the two outputs for each of the databases underlying the vereecken wösten rosetta and barros ptfs and the pelotas river watershed data set small differences are common and many patterns are rather similar which is not very surprising since for example sand content is typically in negative relationship with silt and clay content given that particle and pore size distribution are typically strongly correlated sand content has a negative relationship with water retention at both determined points while those are positively correlated with silt and clay contents however some notable differences emerge upon examining the correlations involving bd and oc contents table 7 it is notable for instance that in the pelotas data set the oc content is in intermediately strong negative correlation with sand content and that it is in positive relationship with clay and silt content in all other data sets however oc s relationship with the textural fractions is either negligible or shows weak correlation with the textural fractions in the opposite direction to a differing degree among the databases but bulk density and oc are in a negative relationship with each other which is likely a result of oc s positive effect on soil aggregation as well as its lighter dry bulk density than that of mineral particles which has generally been recognized in soil science bulk density however has a distinctly different correlation with fc and pwp in the different data sets in the pelotas river barros and vereecken data sets bd is weakly or not correlated with fc whereas in the wösten and rosetta data sets they are intermediately strongly correlated with each other table 7 in the latter two data sets wösten and rosetta bd also shows the strongest correlations with the textural fractions which the other data sets do not show we argue that it is likely that these play a significant role when estimating fc but not necessarily when estimating pwp bulk density is expected to play a role as an influential predictor in the wet ter range of the swrc where structural and mid sized pores hold a significant amount of water if a developed empirical ptf negatively connects bd and fc as in the wösten and rosetta data sets it is likely to lead to errors and partial bias when that ptf is applied to another data set that shows literally no correlation between those variables the wösten and rosetta ptfs yielded strongly biased estimates of fc with high rmse and table 8 confirms that the residuals obtained after estimating fc by the wösten and rosetta ptfs are in a relatively strong correlation with bd the strongest among the observed correlations for any model and any input i e r 0 52 and 0 54 respectively there are substantial differences in the correlations between bd and pwp among the databases as well table 7 but this likely has less influence on those estimates since bd is not considered to be an influential factor on water held at pwp in fact pwp measurements typically take place using disturbed soil samples i e the original measurements ignore soil bd as a factor and only use that information when converting the gravimetric measurements to be expressed in volume percent another notable trend according to table 8 is that for both the fc and pwp estimations all four of the ptf models examined in detail present a notable to intermediately strong negative relationship between silt content and the estimation errors we argue that since there is not very much variability in the silt contents in the pelotas data set over 90 of data falls between 10 and 30 fig 2 this variable does not have much information content towards controlling soil water retention the barros and vereecken data sets show a similarly narrow distribution of silt contents fig 2 that likely lead to the more successful estimation of fc and less estimation bias controlled by silt content table 8 at the same time the residuals correlation with silt content is notably stronger for the wösten and rosetta fc estimates which likely contributed to the observed biased estimation of fc by these ptfs we also note that silt content has a more significant role in determining soil pwp and it is the vereecken and rosetta models that presented the largest residuals silt content correlation for pwp table 8 while those were the two models that predicted pwp with the greatest bias and poorest rmse among the four models we note that among the examined correlation patterns in the data available to us we could not identify notable groupings according to the climate source of the source data at the same time the two best performing ptfs were developed using data of two different climate zones we argue that the type of analysis of the underlying data and the estimation residuals provides useful information towards developing understanding why different ptfs perform differently for an independent data set this can in some cases be combined with a discussion of differences in soil forming factors but that was beyond the scope of this paper given that details such as the source areas or prevailing land use represented by the data in the international data sets are mostly unknown of course such correlation and residual analyses do not negate the need to examine the range and density of data in the underlying data sets since extrapolations beyond the original data range should generally be avoided however extrapolations did not occur in any of the cases examined here 3 5 estimation of aw while fc and pwp represent thresholds at which certain model processes are triggered e g leaching to deeper layers reduced evapotranspiration crop wilting etc aw calculated as their difference is also of relevance a reduction or increase to this metric will translate to more or less water being redistributed in the soil profile and being available for the crop and in turn plays a significant role in e g under or overestimating biomass production or the start of crop senescence therefore it is desirable that the ptf based estimation of that metric is also analyzed as a further criterion when the fc and pwp estimations in this study are paired for prw and aw estimates are plotted against those based on measurements several things are notable one general observation is that the ptfs typically do not return the range visible in measured aw this is expectable due to aw being a product of two already somewhat smoothed estimates i e fc and pwp in some cases as e g with the splintex ptf1 a or rosetta ptfs this phenomenon is rather observable while the michelon and carlesso 2010 and splintex ptf1 b models present a rather broadly distributed albeit biased aw estimation fig 3 second several ptfs produce strongly biased estimates of aw most notably the rosetta the wösten et al 1999 obalum and obi 2012 and michelon and carlesso 2010 ptfs both fc and pwp estimations are already error loaded which will superimpose when the two estimates are deducted from each other aw is typically difficult to estimate both directly and indirectly via fc and pwp because it represents a portion of the water retention curve whose two boundaries i e abundance and connectedness of pore sizes at fc and at pwp are dominantly controlled by different soil properties and variable interactions that independent data sets may not be able to reproduce as a result in our study the smoothened and often biased aw estimates show very weak correlation with measured aw as witnessed by the unacceptably low r2 values in fig 3 r2 ranging from 0 001 to 0 136 with only the barros et al 2013 model s r2 exceeding 0 045 several other studies have also reported low success in estimating aw by ptfs e g tomasella and hodnett 2004 patil et al 2010 wang et al 2012 da costa et al 2013 and silva et al 2017 therefore while there is a need and desire to parameterize field to watershed scale modeling studies users of ptfs are cautioned about the lack of ptf performance that often remains hidden due to lack of critical testing the significance of misjudging fc is mostly in how much excess water by precipitation irrigation or snow melt is routed further i e runoff vs infiltration and redistribution however if the direction of biases in estimating fc and pwp were similar and the true fc pwp difference was estimated acceptably well by a ptf simulated biomass production estimates could be more correct for a location compared to using other ptfs that do not meet that same criterion based on the obtained data in our study there is significant risk that despite the vereecken et al 1989 and barros et al 2013 models presenting the best statistical metrics their use to parameterize a crop model for prw that relies on the fc pwp aw concept should still be approached critically and monitored closely against field trials 4 conclusions in this study parametric and point ptfs calibrated with temperate and tropical soil data along with a physically based ptf were used to estimate θ 33 kpa and θ 1 500 kpa values over a 25 km transect in the subtropical pelotas river watershed prw and evaluate their product aw as fc minus pwp that is a key input to a number of crop growth or water management models used in decision support we expand standard ptf evaluation by performing variable and estimation residual correlation analysis in order to gain deeper understanding why a ptf may do well or fail in a given application area therefore we have examined variable correlations in several data sets behind popular empirical ptfs rosetta wösten vereecken and barros ptfs and in the prw data and managed to establish logical arguments between similarities and differences among variable correlations and each ptf s performance while the presented evidence is not exclusive we argue that the often claimed geo climatic difference or similarity between a ptf s origin and its application site is not or at least not the sole driver of a ptf s expected performance other conditions need to be fulfilled that appear to be explainable or at least observable from the underlying data finally we demonstrated how the databases that served as data sources to ptfs may differ in terms of such correlations despite being large and comprehensive databases that cover soils of similar climatic zones our results provide useful information to the reader towards understanding why different ptfs perform differently when applied to an independent data set and should stimulate similar analyses that help establish to what extent these findings can be generalized funding this work was supported by the brazilian national council for scientific and

2784,sediment connectivity quantifies the intermediate processes between initial erosion and the corresponding sediment yield however fully capturing the variations in sediment connectivity at the event scale and revealing their impact on watershed sediment sources remains challenging herein we established an event based model to assess sediment connectivity by integrating runoff factors the spatiotemporal variability of sediment connectivity was evaluated for 58 rainfall events in three heterogeneous watersheds the degree of sediment connectivity served as an indicator to quantify the proportion of potential sediment transport from units to the watershed outlet with 1 indicating that the eroded sediment can be fully connected and 0 indicating that it cannot be transported moreover the controls of sediment connectivity on watershed sediment sources and yield were determined our results indicated that the watersheds with poor vegetation and dense gullies were characterized by high sediment connectivity during all the rainfall events the connectivity degree was below 0 5 in approximately 80 of the watershed area suggesting that most of the eroded sediment was deposited rainfall amount and duration dominated the degree of connectivity of the distal hillslopes while rainfall intensity exerted a primary control on the transport of sediments from riverbanks to the outlet in addition the increase of mismatched area between sediment connectivity and erosion resulted in the decrease of sediment yield the interaction between sediment connectivity and erosion effectively explained the spatial patterns of sediment sources p 0 05 our work confirmed that the coupled erosion model and sediment connectivity predicted the sediment yield accurately the predictions for different watersheds portrayed that the nash sutcliffe efficiency and willmott s agreement index were greater than 0 70 and 0 89 respectively these findings revealed the role of sediment connectivity and are the critical basis to identify watershed specific sediment management practices keywords sediment connectivity rainfall events spatial distribution sediment yield modified universal soil loss equation musle data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the context of frequent extreme rainfall events associated with climate change sediment transport at short intervals imposes a greater risk of flooding and land degradation dunkerley 2019 approximately 10 high intensity rainfall events could contribute to more than half of the total annual sediment yield according to statistics from 1314 watersheds gonzalez hidalgo et al 2010 li et al 2020 moreover activated sediment sources that trigger high sediment yields exhibit significant variations in response to different magnitudes of rainfall within watersheds xu et al 2021 therefore it is indispensable to identify which areas connect and transport sediment to the outlet during rainfall events sediment connectivity is an effective way to reveal the probability and pathways of sediment transfer from source to an outlet bracken et al 2015 understanding sediment connectivity variations in different rainfall regimes will provide a scientific basis for meticulous watershed management that could be customized to control soil loss in specific periods and regions sediment connectivity reflects the ability of sediments to be transported through heterogeneous landscapes until they reach a specific feature of the landscape e g stream outlet dam lake and the comprehensive role of environmental factors on transport processes keesstra et al 2018 sediment connectivity includes both structural and functional connectivity structural connectivity is a potential physical connection between patches of the watershed system najafi et al 2021 and functional connectivity highlights the actual consequences of mechanical processes involved in erosion transport and deposition pearson et al 2020 a previous study demonstrated a significant positive correlation between sediment yield and sediment connectivity based on the observations of 11 sub watersheds arabkhedri et al 2021 regions with high sediment connectivity have a high probability of eroding sediment loads reaching the watershed outlet because of low barrier levels masselink et al 2016 namely low sediment connectivity decreases sediment accessibility to the outlet since the cascade relationship between the slope and channel or bank and channel is broken fryirs 2013 furthermore compared with the traditional lumped sediment delivery ratio sdr sediment connectivity emphasizes the spatial information of sediment transport from the source to sink at the fundamental unit scale jamshidi et al 2014 thus it attracts huge attention to improve the estimation accuracy of sediment yields by quantifying and incorporating connectivity into existing erosion models michalek et al 2021 currently various methods are available to illustrate sediment connectivity including field observations tracer techniques graph theory and index methods heckmann et al 2018 the index of connectivity ic has been widely validated for multiple scenarios borselli et al 2008 developed ic in regions with vegetation cover or crops then cavalli et al 2013 modified it using the roughness index ri and demonstrated the capability of topography to control sediment connectivity in small watersheds open source software on sediment connectivity was produced crema and cavalli 2018 in addition the results of the first attempt at soil redistribution rates estimated from coupled ic and soil erosion maps confirmed correlation with field data under six cumulative overflow pathway scenarios lópez vicente et al 2015 some scholars linked ic and sdr which were available to correct the erosion models used for large watersheds and obtain sediment yield vigiak et al 2012 for example the ic combined with the revised universal soil loss equation rusle can be used to determine the spatiotemporal variations in sediment yields caused by land use and dam construction zhao et al 2020 woznicki et al 2020 pictured a sediment yield map for the united states of america that linked erosion and downstream transport using the invest sediment retention model and ic these advances utilized sediment connectivity as linkage to explore the nonlinear relationship between erosion and sediment transport and yield modeling sediment connectivity should adequately consider the influencing factors and their weights to improve applicability heckmann et al 2018 hooke and souza 2021 sediment connectivity is influenced by the internal structure of the watershed as well as external rainfall conditions wainwright et al 2011 soil properties and topography affect runoff generation and sediment deposition locations thereby controlling the spatial patterns of sediment connectivity pathways kalantari et al 2019 ran et al 2019 meanwhile the differences in vegetation coverage and land use patterns cause variations in erosion occurrence and sediment interception capacity wu et al 2020 watershed areas also affect sediment connectivity and yield owing to different resistance times and transport distances mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 the reasonability of input data needs to be determined based on the study scales and targets lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 additionally rainfall characteristics such as the rainfall amount intensity and duration play an important role in sediment yield and transport processes badoux et al 2012 xu et al 2021 generally among the different factors affecting sediment connectivity soil and topography are relatively stable in the short term while land cover varies on the seasonal or monthly scale however rainfall is unpredictable and drives the extension contraction and reconstruction of drainage networks which complicates the variations in watershed sediment connectivity sherriff et al 2016 furthermore most past studies focused on the interannual trends in connectivity patterns ignoring the distinct variations in sediment connectivity in different rainfall regimes hooke and souza 2021 although some studies developed connectivity probability to predict sediment fluxes at the event scale they cannot compare the degree of sediment connectivity in the connected areas of a watershed chartin et al 2017 mahoney et al 2021 notably the construction and application of the sediment connectivity framework based on observations of rainfall events are understudied hence the aim of our study was to propose an updated assessment framework of sediment connectivity while incorporating erosion models to predict sediment yield and source distribution at different rainfall event scales the modified universal soil loss equation musle model was applied to calculate the amount of eroded sediment at the source sadeghi et al 2014 then sediment connectivity served as a bridge to link erosion and sediment yield we ultimately implemented this assessment framework in three heterogeneous watersheds the proposed framework mediated the discrepancy between unit erosion and sediment yield measured at the watershed outlet thus providing a better perspective on the sensitivity dynamics of sediment sources to different rainfall regimes 2 study areas and data collection 2 1 study areas we selected three heterogeneous watersheds from north to south in china the dali dl 37 12 37 32 n 108 53 109 32 e duhe dh 31 30 32 37 n 109 11 110 25 e and xiangshui xs 25

resistance was the main soil type in the region grasslands with low and medium levels accounted for 46 of the dl watershed area and drylands covered 44 of the area the dh watershed a mountainous watershed covered an area of 8973 km2 fig 1 b huang et al 2018 in this region the soil types were diverse and included yellowish brown and brown loam and limestone soil land use in the dh watershed was primarily 73 forest land and 16 agricultural land the xs watershed consisted of a hilly region with a drainage area of 1749 km2 fig 1 c li et al 2018 the soil was mostly composed of quaternary red soil notably about 83 of the xs watershed constituted forest land all the three watersheds experienced a monsoon climate and the average annual rainfall in the dl dh and xs watersheds was 382 990 and 1560 mm respectively 2 2 data collection and pre processing detailed information on the sources and attributes of the datasets is presented in table 1 the digital elevation model dem from aster gdem v3 data products with a spatial resolution of 30 m was used to calculate topographic factors accumulated flows and flow directions the soil maps from the second national soil survey data were transformed into 30 m resolution raster layers according to relevant studies on the effect of data resolution on connectivity estimation arabkhedri et al 2021 the main soil parameters used were soil unit symbol texture class available water storage capacity relative proportion of different grain sizes and organic matter the land use of the three watersheds from 2000 to 2018 was extracted from thematic maps of china s land use in addition the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was calculated from landsat 7etm 8oli images of the corresponding months using google earth engine rainfall and hydrological data during the flooding period were obtained from annual hydrological reports of the people s republic of china table 1 the rainfall data consisted of hourly observations from 26 rainfall stations located in the watersheds fig 1 the rainfall amount and maximum rain intensity were interpolated using the inverse distance weighting method to obtain 30 m precision raster layers in arcgis 10 2 ruelland et al 2008 the runoff and suspended sediment content monitored at the qyc zs and mz hydrological stations were tallied fig 1 finally we recorded a total of 10 18 and 30 events in the dl dh and xs watersheds respectively the features of these rainfall events are listed in table 2 3 methods 3 1 model implementation the erosion and sediment connectivity of each unit were calculated based on the factors considered in the musle model sediment connectivity was used as a link to simulate the sediment yield during individual rainfall events in the watersheds then we calibrated the model parameters using the observed sediment yields at the watershed outlet the overall framework is illustrated in fig 2 3 1 1 erosion calculation the musle model was applied to estimate the erosion in individual units using eq 1 given below 1 e unit 11 8 q p r area unit 0 56 k c p l s where eunit is the potential soil loss for each unit per rainfall ton q is the runoff depth mm pr is the peak flow rate m3 s areaunit is the area of each unit m2 k is the soil erodibility ton m2 h m3 ton cm and c p and ls are the usle cover and management soil erosion control practice and topographic factors respectively k was obtained from soil properties according to the method proposed by wischmeier and smith 1978 furthermore the obtained ndvi data were used to calculate the c factors for the months corresponding to different rainfall events yan et al 2020 then we assigned different p values to different watersheds according to slope and land use the ls factor was calculated using the formula proposed by liu et al 2002 where runoff depth q and peak flow rate pr were calculated by scs cn curve equation scs 2004 as follows eqs 2 3 4 2 q r event 0 2 s 2 r event 0 8 s 3 s 25 4 100 cn 10 4 pr ri 3600 r event q area unit where revent is the total rainfall amount of an event mm s is the potential maximum retention or infiltration mm and cn is runoff curve numbers q divided by pr is equal to the ratio of the maximum rain intensity ri mm h to revent multiplied by the unit conversion coefficient 3600 using the proportionality concept 3 1 2 spatial quantification of sediment connectivity the basic form of the ic borselli et al 2008 can be expressed as follow 5 i c k log 10 d up k d dn k log 10 w k s k a k i k n k d i w i s i where the subscript indicates that each unit has its own value the upslope component dup k represents the probability that the sediment generated by the upslope flows to the downstream unit the downslope component ddn k estimates the potential of weighted distance at which the sediments reach the nearest sink along the flow path w represents the weighing factor dimensionless s is the slope m m a is the upslope drainage area m2 and di is the length of the ith unit along the downslope path in this study the defined w represents the impedance of sediment transport and is derived from the surface characteristics that affect the runoff process and sediment flux in the watershed by combining the factors in the musle previous studies indicated that runoff provides energy and carriers for sediment transport tetzlaff et al 2014 thus we added 11 8 q pr areaunit 0 56 to express the dynamic process of the sediment transport capacity meanwhile w is related to vegetation soil and land use management lópez vicente and ben salem 2019 the values of k c and p were applied considering the effect of spatial scale variations in the underlying surface properties on sediment connectivity notably w was adjusted to characterize the actual sediment quantity which depended on the event intensity as shown in eq 6 6 w i 11 8 q i p r i area unit 0 56 k i c i p i the functional connectivity index fcik eq 7 which reflects the relative value of connectivity associated with rainfall runoff at the spatial and temporal scales of the watershed was computed using the watershed outlet as the target fcik was expressed using the following equation 7 fci k log 10 11 8 q pr 0 56 k c p s a k i k n k d i w i s i we normalized the fcik based on boltzmann type sigmoid curves to facilitate comparison of the degree of sediment connectivity dsc in different cases vigiak et al 2012 the value range was 0 to 1 calculated as follows eq 8 8 dsc unit k 1 exp fci 0 k fci k k fci k 1 where fci0 k represents the functional connectivity metric corresponding to 0 5 in the curve the coefficient kfci k regulates the slope of the curve the larger the absolute value of kfci k the stronger the transition fci0 k and kfci k are calibration parameters that can be determined in light of watershed characteristics and sediment events 3 1 3 simulated sediment yield under rainfall event actually simulated sediment yield sysim is a binary

unit k 1 exp fci 0 k f ci k k fci k to validate and calibrate the simulated sediment yield the observed sediment yield syobs of a single rainfall event was calculated using the following equation eq 10 10 s y obs q s c d t where qs is the runoff at the outlet of the watershed m3 s and c is the suspended sediment content kg m3 the simulated annealing algorithm sa was utilized to determine the optimal parameters fci0 k and kfci k the objective function was set in the sa as eq 11 11 f max 1 j 1 n log sy obs j log sy sim j 2 j 1 n log sy obs j log sy ave 2 where syave ton is the average observed sediment yield for j events 3 2 spatial heterogeneity analysis to clarify whether the magnitude of erosion and the degree of sediment connectivity were consistent we counted the areas of mismatch between erosion and sediment connectivity for the 58 rainfall events using the geometric spacing classification geodetector was used to detect spatial variations in sediment yield in response to erosion and connectivity specifically the factor detector quantifies the degree of explanation calculated using the q value wang et al 2016 geodetector was also applied to identify any interactions between erosion and sediment connectivity at spatial units to increase or decrease the explanatory force of the sediment source or determine whether their effects were independent 3 3 model evaluation and uncertainty analysis 3 3 1 evaluation metrics the correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and willmott s index of agreement wia were computed in accordance with the goodness of fit criteria while comprehensively evaluating the prediction of the model krause et al 2005 eqs 12 14 where s y obs and s y sim are average observed value and average simulated value of sediment yield the r legates and mccabe 1999 was calculated using the following equation 12 r j 1 n sy sim s y sim s y obs s y obs j 1 n s y sim s y sim 2 j 1 n s y obs s y obs 2 the r describes the covariance between the observed and simulated variables the proportion of total variance explained by the model can be expressed using r2 the nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was defined as 13 nse 1 j 1 n s y obs s y sim 2 j 1 n s y obs s y obs 2 the value of nse varies from to 1 with 1 representing the perfect model performance the wia willmott 1981 was determined using the following equation 14 wia 1 j 1 n s y obs s y sim 2 j 1 n s y obs s y obs s y sim s y obs 2 where wia is a measure of the degree of error free prediction of the model the wia is a standardized metric and is preferred over mean square error because it can compare different datasets more effectively notably the larger the value of wia the higher the degree of consistency between the observed and simulated values 3 3 2 uncertainty analysis the selected samples of rainfall events and the corresponding observed sediment yields could contribute to the variations in the calibration parameters when fitting the model therefore we utilized leave one out cross validation method to evaluate the effects of rainfall events on the forecast results wong 2015 each rainfall event sample was used as a test set and the remaining n 1 data samples were used as the corresponding training set therefore when the parameters were calibrated using the sa the results reflected the predicted fluctuations in conclusion the stability of the model was reflected in three aspects range of calibration parameters fci0 k kfci k fluctuations in the nse indexes and relative errors re of the output test results eqs 13 and 15 15 re s y sim j s y obs j s y obs j where re reflects the deviation of the simulated sediment yield from the observed yield for the test sample 4 results 4 1 spatial sediment connectivity under different rainfall regimes the spatial variations in sediment connectivity within the watersheds were accurately identified during different rain events we selected six events as examples for detailed comparative analysis fig 3 these events occurred during the same month for each watershed to minimize other interferences the units were connected during the low intensity hydrological events when the hydrological intensity increased the units covered by the degree of sediment connectivity greater than 0 2 remained to connect and tended to expand outward fig 3 in general approximately 80 of the area in the watershed had a sediment connectivity degree of 0 5 fig 3 the spatial distribution of the sediment source was broadly consistent with the spatial pattern of the degree of sediment connectivity fig 3 the low sediment contributions in most regions proved that obvious sediment deposition was exacerbated by dis connectivity during the transport exceptionally some areas having sensitive pathways kept a high contribution to the sediment yield of watershed outlets regardless of the rainfall regime fig 3 b d and f in addition the overall connectivity of the dl watershed was much higher than that of the xs watershed even in cases where the rainfall was minimal owing to poor vegetation coverage and the presence of several gullies as observed in the horizontal comparison of different watersheds fig 3 a and e sediment connectivity exhibited a significant nonlinear response to rainfall although the variation in sediment connectivity differed depending on watershed characteristics the tenfold increase in rainfall led to significant variations in sediment sources fig 3 a b e and f after extreme storm events the sediment connectivity increased from 0 2 to 0 5 with a corresponding increase in the average sediment contribution per source area from 1 55 t ha to 36 t ha fig 3 a and b in addition the increase in rainfall improved the contribution of steep sloped upland areas to the sediment yield at the outlet fig 3 e and f there was also a phenomenon that the areas near the outlet and river remained relatively high connectivity which was most obvious in the largest watershed fig 3 c and d however there was no high sediment source in any riparian zone when the rain intensity was low even though these units were highly connected in particular the 16th event in dh watershed dh16 illustrated that long duration rainfall only transported sediment to the nearby river fig 3 f 4 2 spatial mismatch effects between erosion and sediment connectivity areas with a high potential for triggering soil erosion did not portray a similar capacity for high connectivity we identified four regional patterns low erosion high connectivity le hc low erosion low connectivity le lc high erosion high connectivity he hc and high erosion low connectivity he lc the mismatched areas of erosion and connectivity reached an average of 43 61 the increase in mismatched areas significantly decreased the sediment yield p 0 05 as shown in fig 4 both le hc and le lc accounted for more than 50 with the highest proportion being 98 61 indicating that the sediment yield at the outlet of the watershed was mainly derived from a large number of units having low erosion rates the he lc pattern appeared the least in the watersheds moreover an increase in the area of the he hc regions contributed to a significant increase in sediment yield the dl watershed which represented an erosion prone area of the loess plateau had a higher share of he hc than the dh watershed and the lowest percentage of the high erosion area was observed in the xs watershed fig 4 erosion and connectivity were strongly correlated with the distribution of sediment sources the q values of erosion and sediment connectivity were statistically significant and both were positively correlated with the sediment yield at spatial units p 0 05 erosion had a higher control on the spatial distribution of sediment source contributions compared to sediment connectivity except for dh16 table 3 further the spatial distribution of erosion was less influential in controlling the sediment yield when the scale of erosion decreased table 3 the interaction between erosion and sediment connectivity was bi enhanced in the dl and dh watersheds suggesting that the combined effect of the two factors was greater than that of each factor individually in addition the interaction effect of erosion and sediment connectivity was a nonlinear enhancement greater than the sum of both the factors in the xs watershed this was consistent with previous results that the he hl pattern increased sediment yield significantly 4 3 evaluation of method performance the results of sediment yield obtained using 58 storm events in the three watersheds were considered in detail to identify the model performance as shown in table 4 the values of each evaluation metric indicated a good model performance from different perspectives the r values for the dl dh and xs watersheds were 0 98 0 92 and 0 85 respectively suggesting that the prediction model fitted the observed data well the r2 0 72 indicated that the prediction error of the model was low in addition the nse was greater than 0 7 indicating that the simulated sediment yields were reliable the wia values which serve as a measure of the degree of freedom from error were also above 0 89 quantitative comparisons of the observed versus simulated values provided credibility and pointed out possible miscalculations the simulation error for the 10th event in dl watershed dl10 was large fig 5 a with the observed sediment yield being 1 47 107 tons and the simulation result being 7 88 106 tons this may be because the results for dl10 represented the amount of sediment yield caused by an extreme rainstorm once over a hundred years when the model was applied to the dh watershed the maximum difference between the simulated sediment yield and observed value was 5 34 105 tons with a relative error of 0 39 the best simulated sediment yield was that for dh16 with an error of 1 01 103 tons and a relative error of 0 04 fig 5 b moreover the model was well adapted to 30 events in the xs watershed and was capable of predicting the trends in sediment yield under different rainfall conditions fig 5 c overall the model results were within the acceptable ranges the effect of rainfall on the simulation results in the validation set was reflected the parameter fci0 k varied significantly in the dl watershed with the coefficient of variation cv being 0 14 fig 6 a the cv values of the parameter fci0 k in the dl and xs watersheds were 0 02 and 0 05 respectively in addition the 6th event had the greatest effect on the value of kfci k in the dl watershed red circle in fig 6 b the difference in rainfall events had the greatest effect on the kfci k values in the xs watershed fig 6 c parameter fci0 k was more sensitive than kfci k resulting in larger fluctuations in the simulated sediment yield fig 6 although the simulation of the sediment yield for the special single event was not accurate the overall fit of the model was stable nse 0 78 fig 6 5 discussion 5 1 control element analysis for sediment connectivity at the event scale the underlying surface factors that are invariant in the short term such as geomorphology and soil and vegetation cover varying over months are regarded as stationary factors that affect sediment connectivity the differences in the degree of sediment connectivity between the three watersheds highlighted the long term influence of watershed structure on sediment transport fig 3 topographic configurations and geomorphic sequences i e channel slope confinement and stepped channels control the longitudinal and lateral transport of sediments scorpio et al 2022 in general there was dense forest cover on the steep slopes in the watersheds which contributed to reducing erosion capacity and sediment connectivity mishra et al 2019 this explained the much lower sediment yield of the xs watershed compared to that of the dl watershed similarly sediment connectivity was below 0 1 in the southern portion of the dh watershed despite the steep topography kalantari et al 2019 vegetation provided greater benefits than runoff control in terms of sediment reduction during storms additionally sediment connectivity in the source area involves not only coupling between hillslopes and target outlets but also between tributaries river beaches and channels czuba et al 2017 therefore the sediment source contribution was always high at sensitive sites near the river and target outlet fig 3 in contrast a large amount of sediment released from the hillside was redeposited in the downslope or buffer zone of the floodplain rainfall regimes are dynamic factors that affect sediment connectivity the rainfall driven hydrological processes ultimately determine the frequency distribution and magnitude of actual sediment transport in the watershed the spatial distribution and regime variations in rainfall complicate sediment connectivity and make it difficult to track wainwright et al 2011 our study revealed that the total amount of rainfall rain intensity and rainfall duration controlled the degree of sediment connectivity from different aspects which caused the sediment supply hotspot areas to display various patterns in different rainfall regimes fig 3 the total rainfall and rainfall duration were critical for the cascading effect from the steep uplands in the watershed only large scale events could activate slope channel outlet sediment connectivity throughout the watershed fryirs 2013 another study indicated that the center location of the storm relative to the watershed outlet affected sediment transport activities sigaroodi and chen 2016 a high rainfall intensity would control more areas that had high connectivity resulting in a shorter distance and rapid transport of the temporarily stored river sediment as illustrated in fig 3 c and d furthermore the 2nd event 13 741 tons of sediment yield and 3rd event 6 170 tons of sediment yield occurred consecutively on june 5 and june 10 2018 in the xs watershed fig 5 c erosive events export large amounts of sediments that are temporarily stored in the channel during the initial stages of flooding chartin et al 2017 part of the sediment was only transported to the slope bottom in the 2nd event that received 118 mm of rainfall and had a rain intensity of 18 mm h then the 3rd event 30 mm rainfall and 14 mm h rain intensity remobilized the previously deposited sediment thereby causing high sediment discharge at the outlet under this small hydrological condition an investigation of two floods in italian mountain catchments similarly found that despite the massive activation of sediment sources on hillsides in 2017 sediment storages on talus slopes were still available to provide sediment in 2020 scorpio et al 2022 thus our results support the evidence from previous studies mahoney et al 2021 reiterating that antecedent hydrologic events can be used as stencils for larger events previous studies also demonstrated that a combination of rainfall and runoff was capable of predicting the total suspended sediment load tuset et al 2016 in particular it was important to consider the proportion of rainfall converted into runoff by comparing the dl and xs watersheds for example a tenfold increase in total rainfall resulted in a nonlinear increase in rainfall erosivity and connectivity leading to a 42 fold increase in sediment yield fig 5 a therefore various rainfall events may increase or decrease the flow energy available for sediment separation and transport at different units thus triggering uncertainty in sediment yield when calculating the parameters fig 6 5 2 necessity of sediment connectivity in transport assessment the dynamic assessment of sediment connectivity is an essential step toward achieving a comprehensive understanding of the transport between the sediment source and sink areas a low sediment yield at the watershed scale may not mean that high erosion rates do not exist in the watershed instead the reason can be a mismatch between erosion and connectivity fig 4 erosion represents the amount of sediment available whereas connectivity describes the accessibility of the sediment najafi et al 2021 erosion serves as a prerequisite to sediment supply which is why the sediment source distribution is more dependent on erosion table 3 moreover the spatial simulation of sediment connectivity for rainfall events clarified the strength of the sediment transport capacity which determined the rate of sediment that reached the watershed outlet fig 3 we verified the limiting intensity of restrictions on erosion and connectivity indicating that the comprehensive influence of these two factors enhanced the explanation of the spatial distribution of the sediment sources table 3 therefore the erosion source distribution and the degree of sediment connectivity require to be coupled when calculating sediment yield at the watershed scale some studies also integrated connectivity in erosion models and confirmed their validity rajbanshi and bhattacharya 2020 woznicki et al 2020 for instance the sediment yield in the yanhe river catchment was estimated by combining ic with the rusle model thereby assessing the impact of soil conservation measures zhao et al 2020 however ic represents only the potential sediment transport rate of the landscape and rusle is restricted to the annual scale thus these models have low sensitivity to short term rainfall variations michalek et al 2021 moreover the parameters in these studies used the fixed values proposed by vigiak et al 2012 our results showed that different watersheds and rainfall events could cause the parameters to fluctuate fig 6 once the watershed landscape features and rainfall regimes varied the parameters should be changed otherwise the transport processes may be distorted at partial positions in this study dynamic indicators were added to modify the weighting factor w and the parameters were calibrated to replace the empirical values based on the watershed characteristics and known events the incorporation of the dynamic assessment of sediment connectivity and the musle model bridges the gap between simulated and actual sediment transport under different rainfall events by coupling sediment connectivity with the classic erosion formula we provided a straightforward resolution to quantitatively identify the critical areas of sediment load especially for data sparse areas the simulated sediment yield estimated by sediment connectivity and in situ erosion portrayed excellent and stable performance table 4 fig 6 the coupled connectivity and musle were convenient to obtain and calibrate the parameters reducing the impact of physical structure on simulation accuracy compared with distributed process based models such as the watershed erosion prediction project weep and limburg soil erosion model lisem de barros et al 2014 shen et al 2009 in addition although the soil and water assessment tool swat employing the musle considered the variations in the sdr caused by surface runoff over time the average sdr value was still used in space which could hardly reflect the spatial distribution of sediment transport shi and huang 2021 our method implemented the mapping of specific pathways from erosion sites to watershed outlets and identified different sediment sources for each rainfall event it is possible to forecast soil loss risks using rainfall data in watersheds without long term hydrological sediment monitoring 6 conclusions the quantification of sediment connectivity assisted in mapping the spatial distribution of sediment contribution per unit of watershed at the rainfall event scale we confirmed that the total amount and duration of rainfall were crucial for the cascading effect of long distance sediment transport in the watershed whereas rain intensity controlled the short distance and rapid migration of sediments that were temporarily stored in the riverbanks the proximal riverbank was a hotspot source affecting sediment yield at the watershed outlet erosion and connectivity reflect the sediment loss issues in terms of both sediment denudation and downstream transport loss respectively mismatched areas with respect to erosion and sediment connectivity were identified in all three watersheds notably high erosion areas did not contribute to the major sediment yield sites when they did not have high connectivity the detection of erosion and connectivity interaction effects confirmed that considering both factors improved the understanding of the spatial distribution in sediment source contribution the simulated sediment yields of rainfall events that combined erosion and connectivity were in good agreement with the observed values therefore our study provides sufficient quantitative information on sediment connectivity in different rainfall regimes to identify sediment hotspots which may enable managers to adjust ecological measures and reduce the risk of sediment transport in the watershed coupling erosion and sediment connectivity for the purpose of source control and process optimization can be recommended in watershed sediment management future work to investigate the location of sediment deposition and transport duration during rainfall occurrence as well as field sediment tracing involving validation is needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

2784,sediment connectivity quantifies the intermediate processes between initial erosion and the corresponding sediment yield however fully capturing the variations in sediment connectivity at the event scale and revealing their impact on watershed sediment sources remains challenging herein we established an event based model to assess sediment connectivity by integrating runoff factors the spatiotemporal variability of sediment connectivity was evaluated for 58 rainfall events in three heterogeneous watersheds the degree of sediment connectivity served as an indicator to quantify the proportion of potential sediment transport from units to the watershed outlet with 1 indicating that the eroded sediment can be fully connected and 0 indicating that it cannot be transported moreover the controls of sediment connectivity on watershed sediment sources and yield were determined our results indicated that the watersheds with poor vegetation and dense gullies were characterized by high sediment connectivity during all the rainfall events the connectivity degree was below 0 5 in approximately 80 of the watershed area suggesting that most of the eroded sediment was deposited rainfall amount and duration dominated the degree of connectivity of the distal hillslopes while rainfall intensity exerted a primary control on the transport of sediments from riverbanks to the outlet in addition the increase of mismatched area between sediment connectivity and erosion resulted in the decrease of sediment yield the interaction between sediment connectivity and erosion effectively explained the spatial patterns of sediment sources p 0 05 our work confirmed that the coupled erosion model and sediment connectivity predicted the sediment yield accurately the predictions for different watersheds portrayed that the nash sutcliffe efficiency and willmott s agreement index were greater than 0 70 and 0 89 respectively these findings revealed the role of sediment connectivity and are the critical basis to identify watershed specific sediment management practices keywords sediment connectivity rainfall events spatial distribution sediment yield modified universal soil loss equation musle data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the context of frequent extreme rainfall events associated with climate change sediment transport at short intervals imposes a greater risk of flooding and land degradation dunkerley 2019 approximately 10 high intensity rainfall events could contribute to more than half of the total annual sediment yield according to statistics from 1314 watersheds gonzalez hidalgo et al 2010 li et al 2020 moreover activated sediment sources that trigger high sediment yields exhibit significant variations in response to different magnitudes of rainfall within watersheds xu et al 2021 therefore it is indispensable to identify which areas connect and transport sediment to the outlet during rainfall events sediment connectivity is an effective way to reveal the probability and pathways of sediment transfer from source to an outlet bracken et al 2015 understanding sediment connectivity variations in different rainfall regimes will provide a scientific basis for meticulous watershed management that could be customized to control soil loss in specific periods and regions sediment connectivity reflects the ability of sediments to be transported through heterogeneous landscapes until they reach a specific feature of the landscape e g stream outlet dam lake and the comprehensive role of environmental factors on transport processes keesstra et al 2018 sediment connectivity includes both structural and functional connectivity structural connectivity is a potential physical connection between patches of the watershed system najafi et al 2021 and functional connectivity highlights the actual consequences of mechanical processes involved in erosion transport and deposition pearson et al 2020 a previous study demonstrated a significant positive correlation between sediment yield and sediment connectivity based on the observations of 11 sub watersheds arabkhedri et al 2021 regions with high sediment connectivity have a high probability of eroding sediment loads reaching the watershed outlet because of low barrier levels masselink et al 2016 namely low sediment connectivity decreases sediment accessibility to the outlet since the cascade relationship between the slope and channel or bank and channel is broken fryirs 2013 furthermore compared with the traditional lumped sediment delivery ratio sdr sediment connectivity emphasizes the spatial information of sediment transport from the source to sink at the fundamental unit scale jamshidi et al 2014 thus it attracts huge attention to improve the estimation accuracy of sediment yields by quantifying and incorporating connectivity into existing erosion models michalek et al 2021 currently various methods are available to illustrate sediment connectivity including field observations tracer techniques graph theory and index methods heckmann et al 2018 the index of connectivity ic has been widely validated for multiple scenarios borselli et al 2008 developed ic in regions with vegetation cover or crops then cavalli et al 2013 modified it using the roughness index ri and demonstrated the capability of topography to control sediment connectivity in small watersheds open source software on sediment connectivity was produced crema and cavalli 2018 in addition the results of the first attempt at soil redistribution rates estimated from coupled ic and soil erosion maps confirmed correlation with field data under six cumulative overflow pathway scenarios lópez vicente et al 2015 some scholars linked ic and sdr which were available to correct the erosion models used for large watersheds and obtain sediment yield vigiak et al 2012 for example the ic combined with the revised universal soil loss equation rusle can be used to determine the spatiotemporal variations in sediment yields caused by land use and dam construction zhao et al 2020 woznicki et al 2020 pictured a sediment yield map for the united states of america that linked erosion and downstream transport using the invest sediment retention model and ic these advances utilized sediment connectivity as linkage to explore the nonlinear relationship between erosion and sediment transport and yield modeling sediment connectivity should adequately consider the influencing factors and their weights to improve applicability heckmann et al 2018 hooke and souza 2021 sediment connectivity is influenced by the internal structure of the watershed as well as external rainfall conditions wainwright et al 2011 soil properties and topography affect runoff generation and sediment deposition locations thereby controlling the spatial patterns of sediment connectivity pathways kalantari et al 2019 ran et al 2019 meanwhile the differences in vegetation coverage and land use patterns cause variations in erosion occurrence and sediment interception capacity wu et al 2020 watershed areas also affect sediment connectivity and yield owing to different resistance times and transport distances mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 the reasonability of input data needs to be determined based on the study scales and targets lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 additionally rainfall characteristics such as the rainfall amount intensity and duration play an important role in sediment yield and transport processes badoux et al 2012 xu et al 2021 generally among the different factors affecting sediment connectivity soil and topography are relatively stable in the short term while land cover varies on the seasonal or monthly scale however rainfall is unpredictable and drives the extension contraction and reconstruction of drainage networks which complicates the variations in watershed sediment connectivity sherriff et al 2016 furthermore most past studies focused on the interannual trends in connectivity patterns ignoring the distinct variations in sediment connectivity in different rainfall regimes hooke and souza 2021 although some studies developed connectivity probability to predict sediment fluxes at the event scale they cannot compare the degree of sediment connectivity in the connected areas of a watershed chartin et al 2017 mahoney et al 2021 notably the construction and application of the sediment connectivity framework based on observations of rainfall events are understudied hence the aim of our study was to propose an updated assessment framework of sediment connectivity while incorporating erosion models to predict sediment yield and source distribution at different rainfall event scales the modified universal soil loss equation musle model was applied to calculate the amount of eroded sediment at the source sadeghi et al 2014 then sediment connectivity served as a bridge to link erosion and sediment yield we ultimately implemented this assessment framework in three heterogeneous watersheds the proposed framework mediated the discrepancy between unit erosion and sediment yield measured at the watershed outlet thus providing a better perspective on the sensitivity dynamics of sediment sources to different rainfall regimes 2 study areas and data collection 2 1 study areas we selected three heterogeneous watersheds from north to south in china the dali dl 37 12 37 32 n 108 53 109 32 e duhe dh 31 30 32 37 n 109 11 110 25 e and xiangshui xs 25

resistance was the main soil type in the region grasslands with low and medium levels accounted for 46 of the dl watershed area and drylands covered 44 of the area the dh watershed a mountainous watershed covered an area of 8973 km2 fig 1 b huang et al 2018 in this region the soil types were diverse and included yellowish brown and brown loam and limestone soil land use in the dh watershed was primarily 73 forest land and 16 agricultural land the xs watershed consisted of a hilly region with a drainage area of 1749 km2 fig 1 c li et al 2018 the soil was mostly composed of quaternary red soil notably about 83 of the xs watershed constituted forest land all the three watersheds experienced a monsoon climate and the average annual rainfall in the dl dh and xs watersheds was 382 990 and 1560 mm respectively 2 2 data collection and pre processing detailed information on the sources and attributes of the datasets is presented in table 1 the digital elevation model dem from aster gdem v3 data products with a spatial resolution of 30 m was used to calculate topographic factors accumulated flows and flow directions the soil maps from the second national soil survey data were transformed into 30 m resolution raster layers according to relevant studies on the effect of data resolution on connectivity estimation arabkhedri et al 2021 the main soil parameters used were soil unit symbol texture class available water storage capacity relative proportion of different grain sizes and organic matter the land use of the three watersheds from 2000 to 2018 was extracted from thematic maps of china s land use in addition the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was calculated from landsat 7etm 8oli images of the corresponding months using google earth engine rainfall and hydrological data during the flooding period were obtained from annual hydrological reports of the people s republic of china table 1 the rainfall data consisted of hourly observations from 26 rainfall stations located in the watersheds fig 1 the rainfall amount and maximum rain intensity were interpolated using the inverse distance weighting method to obtain 30 m precision raster layers in arcgis 10 2 ruelland et al 2008 the runoff and suspended sediment content monitored at the qyc zs and mz hydrological stations were tallied fig 1 finally we recorded a total of 10 18 and 30 events in the dl dh and xs watersheds respectively the features of these rainfall events are listed in table 2 3 methods 3 1 model implementation the erosion and sediment connectivity of each unit were calculated based on the factors considered in the musle model sediment connectivity was used as a link to simulate the sediment yield during individual rainfall events in the watersheds then we calibrated the model parameters using the observed sediment yields at the watershed outlet the overall framework is illustrated in fig 2 3 1 1 erosion calculation the musle model was applied to estimate the erosion in individual units using eq 1 given below 1 e unit 11 8 q p r area unit 0 56 k c p l s where eunit is the potential soil loss for each unit per rainfall ton q is the runoff depth mm pr is the peak flow rate m3 s areaunit is the area of each unit m2 k is the soil erodibility ton m2 h m3 ton cm and c p and ls are the usle cover and management soil erosion control practice and topographic factors respectively k was obtained from soil properties according to the method proposed by wischmeier and smith 1978 furthermore the obtained ndvi data were used to calculate the c factors for the months corresponding to different rainfall events yan et al 2020 then we assigned different p values to different watersheds according to slope and land use the ls factor was calculated using the formula proposed by liu et al 2002 where runoff depth q and peak flow rate pr were calculated by scs cn curve equation scs 2004 as follows eqs 2 3 4 2 q r event 0 2 s 2 r event 0 8 s 3 s 25 4 100 cn 10 4 pr ri 3600 r event q area unit where revent is the total rainfall amount of an event mm s is the potential maximum retention or infiltration mm and cn is runoff curve numbers q divided by pr is equal to the ratio of the maximum rain intensity ri mm h to revent multiplied by the unit conversion coefficient 3600 using the proportionality concept 3 1 2 spatial quantification of sediment connectivity the basic form of the ic borselli et al 2008 can be expressed as follow 5 i c k log 10 d up k d dn k log 10 w k s k a k i k n k d i w i s i where the subscript indicates that each unit has its own value the upslope component dup k represents the probability that the sediment generated by the upslope flows to the downstream unit the downslope component ddn k estimates the potential of weighted distance at which the sediments reach the nearest sink along the flow path w represents the weighing factor dimensionless s is the slope m m a is the upslope drainage area m2 and di is the length of the ith unit along the downslope path in this study the defined w represents the impedance of sediment transport and is derived from the surface characteristics that affect the runoff process and sediment flux in the watershed by combining the factors in the musle previous studies indicated that runoff provides energy and carriers for sediment transport tetzlaff et al 2014 thus we added 11 8 q pr areaunit 0 56 to express the dynamic process of the sediment transport capacity meanwhile w is related to vegetation soil and land use management lópez vicente and ben salem 2019 the values of k c and p were applied considering the effect of spatial scale variations in the underlying surface properties on sediment connectivity notably w was adjusted to characterize the actual sediment quantity which depended on the event intensity as shown in eq 6 6 w i 11 8 q i p r i area unit 0 56 k i c i p i the functional connectivity index fcik eq 7 which reflects the relative value of connectivity associated with rainfall runoff at the spatial and temporal scales of the watershed was computed using the watershed outlet as the target fcik was expressed using the following equation 7 fci k log 10 11 8 q pr 0 56 k c p s a k i k n k d i w i s i we normalized the fcik based on boltzmann type sigmoid curves to facilitate comparison of the degree of sediment connectivity dsc in different cases vigiak et al 2012 the value range was 0 to 1 calculated as follows eq 8 8 dsc unit k 1 exp fci 0 k fci k k fci k 1 where fci0 k represents the functional connectivity metric corresponding to 0 5 in the curve the coefficient kfci k regulates the slope of the curve the larger the absolute value of kfci k the stronger the transition fci0 k and kfci k are calibration parameters that can be determined in light of watershed characteristics and sediment events 3 1 3 simulated sediment yield under rainfall event actually simulated sediment yield sysim is a binary

unit k 1 exp fci 0 k f ci k k fci k to validate and calibrate the simulated sediment yield the observed sediment yield syobs of a single rainfall event was calculated using the following equation eq

optimal parameters fci0 k and kfci k the objective function was set in the sa as eq 11 11 f max 1 j 1 n log sy obs j log sy sim j 2 j 1 n log sy obs j log sy ave 2 where syave ton is the average observed sediment yield for j events 3 2 spatial heterogeneity analysis to clarify whether the magnitude of erosion and the degree of sediment connectivity were consistent we counted the areas of mismatch between erosion and sediment connectivity for the 58 rainfall events using the geometric spacing classification geodetector was used to detect spatial variations in sediment yield in response to erosion and connectivity specifically the factor detector quantifies the degree of explanation calculated using the q value wang et al 2016 geodetector was also applied to identify any interactions between erosion and sediment connectivity at spatial units to increase or decrease the explanatory force of the sediment source or determine whether their effects were independent 3 3 model evaluation and uncertainty analysis 3 3 1 evaluation metrics the correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and willmott s index of agreement wia were computed in accordance with the goodness of fit criteria while comprehensively evaluating the prediction of the model krause et al 2005 eqs 12 14 where s y obs and s y sim are average observed value and average simulated value of sediment yield the r legates and mccabe 1999 was calculated using the following equation 12 r j 1 n sy sim s y sim s y obs s y obs j 1 n s y sim s y sim 2 j 1 n s y obs s y obs 2 the r describes the covariance between the observed and simulated variables the proportion of total variance explained by the model can be expressed using r2 the nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was defined as 13 nse 1 j 1 n s y obs s y sim 2 j 1 n s y obs s y obs 2 the value of nse varies from to 1 with 1 representing the perfect model performance the wia willmott 1981 was determined using the following equation 14 wia 1 j 1 n s y obs s y sim 2 j 1 n s y obs s y obs s y sim s y obs 2 where wia is a measure of the degree of error free prediction of the model the wia is a standardized metric and is preferred over mean square error because it can compare different datasets more effectively notably the larger the value of wia the higher the degree of consistency between the observed and simulated values 3 3 2 uncertainty analysis the selected samples of rainfall events and the corresponding observed sediment yields could contribute to the variations in the calibration parameters when fitting the model therefore we utilized leave one out cross validation method to evaluate the effects of rainfall events on the forecast results wong 2015 each rainfall event sample was used as a test set and the remaining n 1 data samples were used as the corresponding training set therefore when the parameters were calibrated using the sa the results reflected the predicted fluctuations in conclusion the

re s y sim j s y obs j s y obs j where re reflects the deviation of the simulated sediment yield from the observed yield for the test sample 4 results 4 1 spatial sediment connectivity under different rainfall regimes the spatial variations in sediment connectivity within the watersheds were accurately identified during different rain events we selected six events as examples for detailed comparative analysis fig 3 these events occurred during the same month for each watershed to minimize other interferences the units were connected during the low intensity hydrological events when the hydrological intensity increased the units covered by the degree of sediment connectivity greater than 0 2 remained to connect and tended to expand outward fig 3 in general approximately 80 of the area in the watershed had a sediment connectivity degree of 0 5 fig 3 the spatial distribution of the sediment source was broadly consistent with the spatial pattern of the degree of sediment connectivity fig 3 the low sediment contributions in most regions proved that obvious sediment deposition was exacerbated by dis connectivity during the transport exceptionally some areas having sensitive pathways kept a high contribution to the sediment yield of watershed outlets regardless of the rainfall regime fig 3 b d and f in addition the overall connectivity of the dl watershed was much higher than that of the xs watershed even in cases where the rainfall was minimal owing to poor vegetation coverage and the presence of several gullies as observed in the horizontal comparison of different watersheds fig 3 a and e sediment connectivity exhibited a significant nonlinear response to rainfall although the variation in sediment connectivity differed depending on watershed characteristics the tenfold increase in rainfall led to significant variations in sediment sources fig 3 a b e and f after extreme storm events the sediment connectivity increased from 0 2 to 0 5 with a corresponding increase in the average sediment contribution per source area from 1 55 t ha to 36 t ha fig 3 a and b in addition the increase in rainfall improved the contribution of steep sloped upland areas to the sediment yield at the outlet fig 3 e and f there was also a phenomenon that the areas near the outlet and river remained relatively high connectivity which was most obvious in the largest watershed fig 3 c and d however there was no high sediment source in any riparian zone when the rain intensity was low even though these units were highly connected in particular the 16th event in dh watershed dh16 illustrated that long duration rainfall only transported sediment to the nearby river fig 3 f 4 2 spatial mismatch effects between erosion and sediment connectivity areas with a high potential for triggering soil erosion did not portray a similar capacity for high connectivity we identified four regional patterns low erosion high connectivity le hc low erosion low connectivity le lc high erosion high connectivity he hc and high erosion low connectivity he lc the mismatched areas of erosion and connectivity reached an average of 43 61 the increase in mismatched areas significantly decreased the sediment yield p 0 05 as shown in fig 4 both le hc and le lc accounted for more than 50 with the highest proportion being 98 61 indicating that the sediment yield at the outlet of the watershed was mainly derived from a large number of units having low erosion rates the he lc pattern appeared the least in the watersheds moreover an increase in the area of the he hc regions contributed to a significant increase in sediment yield the dl watershed which represented an erosion prone area of the loess plateau had a higher share of he hc than the dh watershed and the lowest percentage of the high erosion area was observed in the xs watershed fig 4 erosion and connectivity were strongly correlated with the distribution of sediment sources the q values of erosion and sediment connectivity were statistically significant and both were positively correlated with the sediment yield at spatial units p 0 05 erosion had a higher control on the spatial distribution of sediment source contributions compared to sediment connectivity except for dh16 table 3 further the spatial distribution of erosion was less influential in controlling the sediment yield when the scale of erosion decreased table 3 the interaction between erosion and sediment connectivity was bi enhanced in the dl and dh watersheds suggesting that the combined effect of the two factors was greater than that of each factor individually in addition the interaction effect of erosion and sediment connectivity was a nonlinear enhancement greater than the sum of both the factors in the xs watershed this was consistent with previous results that the he hl pattern increased sediment yield significantly 4 3 evaluation of method performance the results of sediment yield obtained using 58 storm events in the three watersheds were considered in detail to identify the model performance as shown in table 4 the values of each evaluation metric indicated a good model performance from different perspectives the r values for the dl dh and xs watersheds were 0 98 0 92 and 0 85 respectively suggesting that the prediction model fitted the observed data well the r2 0 72 indicated that the prediction error of the model was low in addition the nse was greater than 0 7 indicating that the simulated sediment yields were reliable the wia values which serve as a measure of the degree of freedom from error were also above 0 89 quantitative comparisons of the observed versus simulated values provided credibility and pointed out possible miscalculations the simulation error for the 10th event in dl watershed dl10 was large fig 5 a with the observed sediment yield being 1 47 107 tons and the simulation result being 7 88 106 tons this may be because the results for dl10 represented the amount of sediment yield caused by an extreme rainstorm once over a hundred years when the model was applied to the dh watershed the maximum difference between the simulated sediment yield and observed value was 5 34 105 tons with a relative error of 0 39 the best simulated sediment yield was that for dh16 with an error of 1 01 103 tons and a relative error of 0 04 fig 5 b moreover the model was well adapted to 30 events in the xs watershed and was capable of predicting the trends in sediment yield under different rainfall conditions fig 5 c overall the model results were within the acceptable ranges the effect of rainfall on the simulation results in the validation set was reflected the parameter fci0 k varied significantly in the dl watershed with the coefficient of variation cv being 0 14 fig 6 a the cv values of the parameter fci0 k in the dl and xs watersheds were 0 02 and 0 05 respectively in addition the 6th event had the greatest effect on the value of kfci k in the dl watershed red circle in fig 6 b the difference in rainfall events had the greatest effect on the kfci k values in the xs watershed fig 6 c parameter fci0 k was more sensitive than kfci k resulting in larger fluctuations in the simulated sediment yield fig 6 although the simulation of the sediment yield for the special single event was not accurate the overall fit of the model was stable nse 0 78 fig 6 5 discussion 5 1 control element analysis for sediment connectivity at the event scale the underlying surface factors that are invariant in the short term such as geomorphology and soil and vegetation cover varying over months are regarded as stationary factors that affect sediment connectivity the differences in the degree of sediment connectivity between the three watersheds highlighted the long term influence of watershed structure on sediment transport fig 3 topographic configurations and geomorphic sequences i e channel slope confinement and stepped channels control the longitudinal and lateral transport of sediments scorpio et al 2022 in general there was dense forest cover on the steep slopes in the watersheds which contributed to reducing erosion capacity and sediment connectivity mishra et al 2019 this explained the much lower sediment yield of the xs watershed compared to that of the dl watershed similarly sediment connectivity was below 0 1 in the southern portion of the dh watershed despite the steep topography kalantari et al 2019 vegetation provided greater benefits than runoff control in terms of sediment reduction during storms additionally sediment connectivity in the source area involves not only coupling between hillslopes and target outlets but also between tributaries river beaches and channels czuba et al 2017 therefore the sediment source contribution was always high at sensitive sites near the river and target outlet fig 3 in contrast a large amount of sediment released from the hillside was redeposited in the downslope or buffer zone of the floodplain rainfall regimes are dynamic factors that affect sediment connectivity the rainfall driven hydrological processes ultimately determine the frequency distribution and magnitude of actual sediment transport in the watershed the spatial distribution and regime variations in rainfall complicate sediment connectivity and make it difficult to track wainwright et al 2011 our study revealed that the total amount of rainfall rain intensity and rainfall duration controlled the degree of sediment connectivity from different aspects which caused the sediment supply hotspot areas to display various patterns in different rainfall regimes fig 3 the total rainfall and rainfall duration were critical for the cascading effect from the steep uplands in the watershed only large scale events could activate slope channel outlet sediment connectivity throughout the watershed fryirs 2013 another study indicated that the center location of the storm relative to the watershed outlet affected sediment transport activities sigaroodi and chen 2016 a high rainfall intensity would control more areas that had high connectivity resulting in a shorter distance and rapid transport of the temporarily stored river sediment as illustrated in fig 3 c and d furthermore the 2nd event 13 741 tons of sediment yield and 3rd event 6 170 tons of sediment yield occurred consecutively on june 5 and june 10 2018 in the xs watershed fig 5 c erosive events export large amounts of sediments that are temporarily stored in the channel during the initial stages of flooding chartin et al 2017 part of the sediment was only transported to the slope bottom in the 2nd event that received 118 mm of rainfall and had a rain intensity of 18 mm h then the 3rd event 30 mm rainfall and 14 mm h rain intensity remobilized the previously deposited sediment thereby causing high sediment discharge at the outlet under this small hydrological condition an investigation of two floods in italian mountain catchments similarly found that despite the massive activation of sediment sources on hillsides in 2017 sediment storages on talus slopes were still available to provide sediment in 2020 scorpio et al 2022 thus our results support the evidence from previous studies mahoney et al 2021 reiterating that antecedent hydrologic events can be used as stencils for larger events previous studies also demonstrated that a combination of rainfall and runoff was capable of predicting the total suspended sediment load tuset et al 2016 in particular it was important to consider the proportion of rainfall converted into runoff by comparing the dl and xs watersheds for example a tenfold increase in total rainfall resulted in a nonlinear increase in rainfall erosivity and connectivity leading to a 42 fold increase in sediment yield fig 5 a therefore various rainfall events may increase or decrease the flow energy available for sediment separation and transport at different units thus triggering uncertainty in sediment yield when calculating the parameters fig 6 5 2 necessity of sediment connectivity in transport assessment the dynamic assessment of sediment connectivity is an essential step toward achieving a comprehensive understanding of the transport between the sediment source and sink areas a low sediment yield at the watershed scale may not mean that high erosion rates do not exist in the watershed instead the reason can be a mismatch between erosion and connectivity fig 4 erosion represents the amount of sediment available whereas connectivity describes the accessibility of the sediment najafi et al 2021 erosion serves as a prerequisite to sediment supply which is why the sediment source distribution is more dependent on erosion table 3 moreover the spatial simulation of sediment connectivity for rainfall events clarified the strength of the sediment transport capacity which determined the rate of sediment that reached the watershed outlet fig 3 we verified the limiting intensity of restrictions on erosion and connectivity indicating that the comprehensive influence of these two factors enhanced the explanation of the spatial distribution of the sediment sources table 3 therefore the erosion source distribution and the degree of sediment connectivity require to be coupled when calculating sediment yield at the watershed scale some studies also integrated connectivity in erosion models and confirmed their validity rajbanshi and bhattacharya 2020 woznicki et al 2020 for instance the sediment yield in the yanhe river catchment was estimated by combining ic with the rusle model thereby assessing the impact of soil conservation measures zhao et al 2020 however ic represents only the potential sediment transport rate of the landscape and rusle is restricted to the annual scale thus these models have low sensitivity to short term rainfall variations michalek et al 2021 moreover the parameters in these studies used the fixed values proposed by vigiak et al 2012 our results showed that different watersheds and rainfall events could cause the parameters to fluctuate fig 6 once the watershed landscape features and rainfall regimes varied the parameters should be changed otherwise the transport processes may be distorted at partial positions in this study dynamic indicators were added to modify the weighting factor w and the parameters were calibrated to replace the empirical values based on the watershed characteristics and known events the incorporation of the dynamic assessment of sediment connectivity and the musle model bridges the gap between simulated and actual sediment transport under different rainfall events by coupling sediment connectivity with the classic erosion formula we provided a straightforward resolution to quantitatively identify the critical areas of sediment load especially for data sparse areas the simulated sediment yield estimated by sediment connectivity and in situ erosion portrayed excellent and stable performance table 4 fig 6 the coupled connectivity and musle were convenient to obtain and calibrate the parameters reducing the impact of physical structure on simulation accuracy compared with distributed process based models such as the watershed erosion prediction project weep and limburg soil erosion model lisem de barros et al 2014 shen et al 2009 in addition although the soil and water assessment tool swat employing the musle considered the variations in the sdr caused by surface runoff over time the average sdr value was still used in space which could hardly reflect the spatial distribution of sediment transport shi and huang 2021 our method implemented the mapping of specific pathways from erosion sites to watershed outlets and identified different sediment sources for each rainfall event it is possible to forecast soil loss risks using rainfall data in watersheds without long term hydrological sediment monitoring 6 conclusions the quantification of sediment connectivity assisted in mapping the spatial distribution of sediment contribution per unit of watershed at the rainfall event scale we confirmed that the total amount and duration of rainfall were crucial for the cascading effect of long distance sediment transport in the watershed whereas rain intensity controlled the short distance and rapid migration of sediments that were temporarily stored in the riverbanks the proximal riverbank was a hotspot source affecting sediment yield at the watershed outlet erosion and connectivity reflect the sediment loss issues in terms of both sediment denudation and downstream transport loss respectively mismatched areas with respect to erosion and sediment connectivity were identified in all three watersheds notably high erosion areas did not contribute to the major sediment yield sites when they did not have high connectivity the detection of erosion and connectivity interaction effects confirmed that considering both factors improved the understanding of the spatial distribution in sediment source contribution the simulated sediment yields of rainfall events that combined erosion and connectivity were in good agreement with the observed values therefore our study provides sufficient quantitative information on sediment connectivity in different rainfall regimes to identify sediment hotspots which may enable managers to adjust ecological measures and reduce the risk of sediment transport in the watershed coupling erosion and sediment connectivity for the purpose of source control and process optimization can be recommended in watershed sediment management future work to investigate the location of sediment deposition and transport duration during rainfall occurrence as well as field sediment tracing involving validation is needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
