5150,when a severe drought occurs people often question the amount of water required to recover from the drought which is difficult to determine here we present a method to determine the amount of water required including both runoff and precipitation for hydrological drought recovery from a drought propagation perspective we also consider multi scale meteorological and hydrological anomaly indices mai and hai with non standardized properties we present three rainfall driven basins in southern china to validate the proposed approach using long term monthly runoff and precipitation records drought propagation characteristics such as duration severity development and recovery processes were extracted using the hai and mai obtained via a threshold level method and run theory the proposed method allows estimating the amount of water required including runoff and the corresponding precipitation for any hydrological drought to recover to normal using hai and mai moreover a linear relationship between runoff and the corresponding precipitation was established r2 0 99 to estimate the amount of precipitation required to recover from a certain hydrological drought the methods presented in this study can be used for assessing and managing water resources and ecosystem response during periods of hydrological drought keywords hydrological drought drought indices propagation recovery multi scale 1 introduction persistent droughts put substantial pressure on water resources and ecosystems aghakouchak et al 2015a belesova et al 2019 mishra singh 2010 sutanto et al 2020 droughts can be broadly classified into four types meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic droughts these categories refer to the deficits of precipitation soil moisture river discharge and social water demand respectively mishra et al 2015 mishra and singh 2010 hydrological drought characterized by streamflow or groundwater level deficit is driven by continuation or propagation of a meteorological drought linsley et al 1982 the impact of droughts typically increases when a meteorological drought turns into a hydrological drought affecting the ecosystem e g water quality attrill power 2000 ahmadi et al 2019 li et al 2018 residents as well as industrial and agricultural production aghakouchak et al 2015a sheffield et al 2012 campana et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 therefore water resource managers require drought recovery metrics to monitor droughts and their propagation for managing water resource systems borgomeo et al 2015 carcia et al 2019 kuriqi et al 2019 li et al 2019 tran et al 2017 following its onset the lifecycle of a hydrological drought includes development and recovery or termination parry et al 2016a b development is defined as the period from the onset of hydrological drought to the time when the maximum intensity is realized while the recovery refers to the period from the maximum intensity of hydrological drought to complete recovery wu et al 2018a 2019 in recent years the hydrological drought recovery process has received widespread attention using the gravity recovery and climate experiment total water storage dataset grace tws and extended gract tws data for example the average recovery time of hydrological droughts in texas thomas et al 2014 and the yangtze river basin zhang et al 2016 were estimated to be approximately 3 13 and 3 3 months respectively investigating the relationship between hydrological drought recovery time and catchment characteristics such as elevation storage and land cover of the 52 watersheds in britain revealed that storage capacity is crucial to realize recovery parry et al 2016a wu et al 2018a further proposed a systematic approach for describing drought development and recovery characteristics such as time and severity and a method for modeling drought propagation speed although these previous studies provide valuable information regarding the evolution of hydrological droughts and their recovery times the amount of water required e g through precipitation for hydrological drought recovery has not been addressed previous studies have analyzed the precipitation required for meteorological drought recovery antofie et al 2015 pan et al 2013 the studies were either based on precipitation shortage during the months preceding drought termination or a particular meteorological drought level value to judge the precipitation required for drought recovery however hydrological drought recovery also includes the gradual accumulation of water in streams and rivers to return to normal rather than being dependent solely on the amount of precipitation ap in the preceding months thus it is worth investigating the water required for hydrological drought recovery from a propagation perspective note that the term water henceforth refers to both the amount of runoff and its corresponding precipitation required for hydrological drought recovery there are several drought indices designed for drought monitoring prediction and water resources management purposes mishra singh 2010 shukla et al 2011 the standardized streamflow index ssi vicente serrano et al 2011 and the standardized runoff index sri shukla wood 2008 evolved from the standardized precipitation index spi widely used for identifying meteorological drought mckee et al 1993 thus ssi and sri share the advantages of spi i e multiple timescales simple calculation and less data input however they do not directly reflect the amount of water required for recovery as they are dimensionless indices streamflow anomaly percentage sap zaidman et al 2002 and streamflow anomaly index sai wang feng 2000 maintain dimensionality properties however they employ a fixed timescale e g monthly or annual and average streamflow as the calculation parameter consequently the cumulative effects of drought for a prolonged event are neglected mishra singh 2010 fixed or variable thresholds based on percentiles of the flow duration curve e g thresholds between the 70th and 90th percentile are also frequently applied to extract hydrological drought characteristics i e duration and severity with non standardized indices van loon et al 2016 overall droughts have multiple timescale features e g 1 month 3 month or 12 month timescales mishra singh 2010 mo lettenmaier 2018 thus a non standardized dimensional index with multiple timescales is required to identify streamflow shortage and the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery therefore this study aims to obtain the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery based on a non standardized dimensional index with multiple timescales we performed three main tasks constructing reliable meteorological and hydrological anomaly indices mai and hai with non standardization and multiple timescales features establishing a method to obtain the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery from the propagation perspective with the mai and hai revealing the relationship between the amounts of runoff required and the corresponding precipitation this paper presents a simple and convenient method for drought identification and estimation of the water required for hydrological drought recovery 2 methodology 2 1 overview the methodological framework proposed in this paper includes two parts fig 1 part 1 construct and validate the hai and mai and part 2 determine the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery the detailed methods for the construction and validation of hai and mai are presented in section 2 2 2 part 1 in fig 1 note that the method for hai and mai construction is consistent with spi and sri which are two widely used standardized meteorological and hydrological drought indices mishra singh 2010 section 2 2 3 part 2 in fig 1 introduces the steps to obtain the amount of water required and corresponding precipitation for recovering hydrological drought based on the mai and hai indices 2 2 hydrological and meteorological anomaly indices part 1 2 2 1 construction of hai and mai step 1 in part 1 the long term runoff and precipitation records for a certain basin were separated in a 2 3 ratio in which the first 66 66 series were used to construct the hai and mai series and the remaining data were used to validate the rationality of the obtained hai and mai series the anomaly of regional runoff during a certain period compared with the average regional runoff obtained over a long period is used to represent the abnormal condition of hydrological drought thus the monthly runoff 30 years records matrix is arranged and combined by months i e time series of the monthly average corresponding to year to obtain the monthly average of runoff the anomaly series of the monthly runoff in the corresponding month are then calculated called the anomaly index ai as follows 1 ai x 1 i x 1 x 2 i x 2 x 12 i x 12 x 1 i 1 x 1 x 2 i 1 x 2 x 12 i 1 x 12 x 1 n x 1 x 2 n x 2 x 12 n x 12 where i and n represent the first and the last years of the time series and 1i 2i 12i are january february december in the first year the rest may be deduced by analogy 1n 2n 12n represents january february december in the last year and x 1 x 2 x 12 represents the monthly average of runoff in a long term time series 30 years because hydrological drought is a cumulative phenomenon resulting from prolonged water shortage mckee et al 1993 shukla wood 2008 hai and mai use a moving window method for different timescales e g 1 3 12 and 24 month timescales for example the 1 month moving cumulative window of ai for runoff is called hai 1 the original ai sequence in eq 1 the 3 month moving cumulative window of ai for runoff is called hai 3 and the successive n month moving window of ai for runoff is called hai n in this paper similarly the steps for constructing the mai with multiple timescales is the same as that of hai however the difference is that the x variable in the eq 1 is changed into the precipitation variable and the x 1 x 2 x 12 is also changed into the long term average of the precipitation per month 2 2 2 determination of thresholds for hai and mai step 2 and 3 in part 1 each drought threshold of hai and mai was obtained using the method of equal probability transformation lloyd hughes saunders 2002 the cumulative distribution frequencies cdf of each drought level were obtained from the sri and spi time series of a certain timescale the thresholds of hai and mai drought levels corresponding to those of sri and spi were then calculated via the equal probability transformation see fig s1 for example assuming that the threshold of sri or spi drought level in a certain timescale is t1 the corresponding cdf1 of hydrological or meteorological drought is transformed into the corresponding timescale of cdf2 for hai or mai in an equivalent manner thus the t2 value of hai or mai corresponding to the cdf2 is a drought threshold of hai or mai the original drought levels of sri and spi are 0 according to previous studies mckee et al 1993 shukla wood 2008 step 2 in part 1 to verify the rationality of hai and mai the different timescales of hai and mai were compared with the corresponding timescales of the widely used multi scale standardized runoff and precipitation indices sri spi step 3 in part 1 mckee et al 1993 shukla wood 2008 we built the hai and mai because they have dimensional features which help us obtain the amount of water shortage directly during a drought 2 3 amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery part 2 the left of fig 2 shows a simple example of the watershed yield according to the water balance of the hydrological cycle for a certain catchment the flow of a river channel is derived from precipitation snowmelt soil moisture groundwater or other sources i e import of water into the watershed in contrast a decrease in the flow is closely related to evaporation transpiration and diversions out of the watershed e g water for human use not shown in fig 2 there are only two aspects of flow change in the river channel rising or falling in other words when the flow in the river is effectively replenished the flow will rise and vice versa the right part of fig 2 flow process shows that the river flow rises or falls when the discharges are replenished or weakened namely the flow in the current month minus that in the preceding month is larger than or less than 0 for example the recharge of flow in a river channel is dependent on precipitation in a rainfall driven basin thus the amount of runoff required and the corresponding precipitation for the hydrological drought recovery should be obtained based on these obtained data we designed a method to determine the amount of water required i e the amount of runoff to recover from the hydrological drought can be directly obtained from the precipitation for making typical hydrological droughts e g 2 year 5 year and 10 year return periods referred to herein as 2a 5a 10a respectively to recover to normal i e the drought index should be larger than the drought threshold which mainly includes the following two steps 2 3 1 describing hydrological drought step 1 in part 2 1 the hydrological drought characteristics are extracted including drought duration d severity s and intensity i using run theory the right part of fig 2 yevjevich 1967 the drought threshold of hai or mai was used to identify the hydrological or meteorological drought characteristics where d is defined as the period from drought start to drought end during which the drought index remains below the truncation level of run theory s is the cumulative drought index during the d and i is the average of s 2 the joint return period between d and s is constructed for example using bivariate fitting functions e g gaussian clayton frank and gumbel in the two dimensional archimedean copula family to examine the return period of hydrological drought characteristics sklar 1959 the bivariate fitting functions are used here because drought has multiple features e g d s and i although d s and i are three important properties of droughts any two of them are sufficient to characterize a single drought tu et al 2018 the parameters for the marginal distribution function and the joint probability distribution function are estimated using the maximum likelihood method the optimal marginal distribution is selected using the kolmogorov smirnov k s test chakravarti et al 1968 and the optimal joint probability distribution is selected through the root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe coefficient n sc and akaike information criterion aic if the values of rmse and aic are small and the value of n sc is large the distance will be minimized between the theoretical and the empirical joint probability distributions of the copula borgomeo et al 2015 thereafter the return period of hydrological drought characteristics is determined based on the optimal archimedean copula function and the typical droughts in the region are identified to help the readers better understand the copula function steps we have described the process in the supporting information 2 3 2 estimate the amount of water required for recovery step 2 in part 2 1 amount of runoff the internal propagation of hydrological drought wu et al 2018a refers to the process of hydrological drought onset and termination onset is defined as the point when the drought index value first decreases such that it is lower higher than the drought threshold e g in the run theory of fig 2 the d1 value is obtained based on the probability of the spi drought threshold the hydrological drought development and recovery periods are defined as the periods from onset the time of drought start tst to maximum intensity pi the maximum absolute value of a drought index in the drought and from pi the time of pi tpi to termination the time of drought termination tdt respectively when the difference between the drought index of the current month and that of the preceding months is greater than d1 the drought is in the normal recovery phase denoted by the solid red line in the run theory of fig 2 however the amount of runoff in the river must be replenished during the current month to maintain recovery otherwise it is a false recovery phenomenon as mentioned above wu et al 2018a in such scenarios the monthly runoff would continue to fall and the drought severity would worsen relative to the preceding month denoted by the dashed red line in the run theory of fig 2 thus the amount of runoff required for hydrological drought recovery is defined as the amount of runoff supply ars required during the recovery period the water supply for the final month of drought recovery the month before the termination of hydrological drought is the difference between the final drought index value and d1 ha i t dt d 1 therefore the ars for recovering hydrological drought is calculated as follows 2 ars h a i t dt d 1 t pi t dt h a i i h a i i 1 h a i i h a i i 1 0 where tpi and tdt are the times of pi and drought termination and i and i 1 represent the current month and the preceding month during the hydrological drought recovery period respectively 2 amount of precipitation the hai and mai values of the current month are affected by the preceding month we account for this by calculating the variation in the current month s i mai or hai value relative to the preceding month s i 1 value i e ma i i m a i i 1 ha i i h a i i 1 for each month within a given year thus the variable of monthly runoff supply required during the hydrological drought recovery period is input into the relationship of the corresponding month and the corresponding amount of the monthly precipitation required is obtained the ap corresponding to the water runoff during the recovery period is regarded as the possible precipitation required for hydrological drought recovery this is because although the runoff supply for a certain river may be affected by various factors van loon et al 2016 it is undeniable that precipitation is a key factor driving hydrological drought recovery particularly in rainfall driven basins tallaksen and van lanen 2004 3 study case and data set we focused on three rainfall driven basins in southern china to demonstrate our methods the yuecheng 531 km2 the xixi 2466 km2 and the jianxi 16 152 km2 river basins fig 3 hereafter the basins will be referred to as basin 1 basin 2 and basin 3 respectively all three basins have unaltered flow no human regulation via reservoir regulation and climatology dominated by humid south asian subtropical monsoons with precipitation and runoff mainly occurring during the warm season fig s2 we used long term 40 years monthly runoff and precipitation records for each region in the analysis the monthly runoff and precipitation records from january 1960 to december 2006 for basin 1 were provided by the water conservancy and electric power bureau in guangdong province in china the monthly runoff and precipitation data spanning january 1960 to december 2010 for basin 2 and from january 1960 to december 2006 for basin 3 were collected by the meteorology agency and water conservation agency of fujian province table 1 the data underwent strict quality control and have been used for previous hydrological and meteorological drought identification research wang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 2018a the control hydrologic stations for basin 1 basin 2 and basin 3 are yuecheng anxi and qilijie respectively we used the simple arithmetic mean method to obtain the basin average monthly precipitation for basins with multiple stations 4 results 4 1 validation of hai and mai the hai and mai values for the varying timescales agree with the corresponding sri and spi results particularly for the 12 and 24 month timescales figs s3 s5 as the values of sri and spi drop the values of hai and mai are also reduced and vice versa in addition the correlation between hai mai and sri spi in the same timescale periods is relatively high 0 70 both in the model development and the validation periods fig 4 this is because the hai and mai are built consistent wtih sri and spi previous studies have also confirmed that sri and spi perform well for identifying hydrological and meteorological drought across the three basins we focus on here wang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 2018a we further used the 3 month hai and mai hai 3 and mai 3 for drought analysis of our selected study areas due to the timescale of the multi seasonal droughts in the region lu wang 2012 we have included additional details within the supporting information that demonstrate the case for obtaining the drought threshold of hai 3 using the equal frequency transform method fig s1 and a summary of the drought levels of hai 3 and mai 3 table s1 4 2 amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery 4 2 1 selection of the appropriate marginal distribution and copula function following the methods described in section 2 3 1 we determined that the log normal distribution function performs better for our study regions relative to the exponential and gamma distributions based on the k s statistics table s2 the dmax for the log normal distribution is smaller than that of the exponential and log normal distributions in general to determine the combined return period of d and s four bivariate fitting functions gaussian clayton frank and gumbel were evaluated using goodness of fit criteria table s3 the minimum values of rmse and aic and the maximum value of n sc are gaussian bivariate distribution functions thus the gaussian function was selected to determine the joint return period of d and s as shown in fig 5 4 2 2 understanding the typical droughts fig 5 illustrates that there is a representative linear relationship between d and s within basin 1 r2 0 79 basin 2 r2 0 91 and basin 3 r2 0 82 the drought characteristics samples are mostly within the 95 of the predictive band of the linear relationship for the three basins as d and s increase the joint return period also shows an increasing trend and the hydrological d and s are different in different return periods which indicate that the drought prevention and mitigation should be performed based on the differences in hydrological conditions at different hydrometric stations additionally different measures must be taken in other parts of the world for fighting against droughts and reducing disasters the typical hydrological droughts fig 5 no 1 no 2 no 3 no 4 and no 5 were selected based on the 2a 5a 10a 25a and 50a return periods as the longest runoff records have 51 years of data basin 2 the selection criteria are proximity to the line grey dashed line of the joint return period and the drought samples are within the 95 prediction band of their linear relationship for basin 1 they are 1989 08 1990 01 d and s are 6 months and 2 62 108 m3 1977 02 1978 03 14 months and 5 10 108 m3 1998 08 1999 09 14 months and 8 29 108 m3 1990 06 1992 01 20 months and 14 46 108 m3 and 2003 05 2005 05 25 months and 15 93 108 m3 respectively meanwhile for basin 2 they are 1986 09 1986 12 4 months and 10 09 108 m3 1991 02 1991 10 9 months and 28 35 108 m3 1967 06 1968 11 18 months and 48 73 108 m3 2003 03 2004 10 20 months and 60 19 108 m3 and 2007 11 2010 01 27 months and 62 61 108 m3 respectively finally for basin 3 they are 1980 06 1980 09 4 months and 58 74 108 m3 1986 06 1987 03 10 months and 133 93 108 m3 1963 02 1963 12 11 months and 173 51 108 m3 1995 11 1997 06 20 months and 291 25 108 m3 and 1971 02 1972 08 23 months and 361 61 108 m3 respectively 4 2 3 water required for hydrological drought recovery in the study basins for each basin the pearson correlation coefficient between hai 3 and mai 3 is relatively high 0 60 fig 6 a this is true for the current month and for the preceding month e g the higher correlation tends to tilt to the lower right of the 1 1 line since s of the current month is a cumulative value based on the preceding month we excluded the effect of s in the preceding months and further analyzed the relationship between hai 3 and mai 3 we found that when the cumulative effects are neglected hai 3 and mai 3 agree well for each individual month s drought severity fig 6 b thus there are 12 linear relationships between the monthly hai 3 and mai 3 within a year after eliminating the effects mentioned above for each basin the detailed linear equation is in table s4 which are then used to obtain the ap required for recovering from hydrological drought according to the design method in section 2 3 2 step 2 part 2 as the return period increases from 2a to 50a the recovery time for hydrological drought also increases the average recovery time is from approximately 2 months to 13 months fig 7 a our results indicate that for basin 1 the amounts of runoff required for recovery of five typical hydrological droughts 2a 5a 10a 25a and 50a are 0 70 108 m3 1 02 108 m3 2 31 108 m3 3 26 108 m3 and 4 25 108 m3 and the corresponding precipitation providing these water quantities are 196 56 mm 250 69 mm 544 23 mm 805 55 mm and 989 65 mm respectively for basin 2 the amounts of runoff required for five typical hydrological droughts are 4 79 108 m3 5 79 108 m3 7 36 108 m3 10 97 108 m3 and 13 17 108 m3 and their corresponding precipitations amounts are 260 93 mm 287 32 mm 387 93 mm 650 88 mm and 816 53 mm respectively for basin 3 they are 20 32 108 m3 26 90 108 m3 38 71 108 m3 48 86 108 m3 and 66 25 108 m3 and corresponding precipitation amounts are 116 59 mm 178 98 mm 265 95 mm 351 66 mm and 499 12 mm respectively as detailed in fig 7b there is a strong linear relationship r2 0 99 between the ars for hydrological drought recovery and the corresponding ap for each of the three basins these linear equations can then be used to obtain the ap required for a certain hydrological drought in each study area 5 discussion the hydrological and meteorological anomaly indices hai and mai developed in this study are non standardized contain multiple timescale properties and are better at identifying the propagation process of regional meteorological and hydrological droughts because they are calculated based on the back stepping method of spi their fluctuations are consistent with sri and spi for the same timescales figs s3 s5 and the correlation between hai mai and sri spi is significant fig 4 hence they can serve to identify and monitor meteorological and hydrological droughts alternatively the amount of water shortage during hydrological drought propagation can be obtained directly via hai whereas sri and spi cannot because they provide standardized values previous studies pan et al 2013 antofie et al 2015 have provided several useful methods for obtaining the ap required for meteorological drought recovery however previous studies cannot estimate the possible precipitation required for hydrological drought recovery estimating the required amount of precipitation for drought recovery however is highly uncertain the studies conducted by pan et al 2013 and antofie et al 2015 were very informative in which they employed the standardized drought index for analyzing the ap required for meteorological drought recovery these studies emphasized the importance of considering the drought propagation process parry et al 2016a wu et al 2018a and not just one specific drought level for a particular month moreover although several recent studies have considered other measures e g water quality and vegetation productivity for investigating drought recovery ahmadi et al 2019 campana et al 2018 schwalm et al 2017 yu et al 2017 the water required for a certain hydrological drought recovering was not considered given the importance of water required for drought recovery for water resource management we have focused on estimating the amount of precipitation for hydrological drought recovery van loon 2015 the results also indicate that the three case studies yuecheng xixi and jianxi river basins differ in the amounts of runoff and precipitation required for recovering from hydrological drought fig 7 which is related to differences in watershed characteristics fig s1 and table s1 on the surface the drought severity in basin 3 appears greater than in basin 2 and basin 1 fig 5 however the corresponding precipitation required for hydrological drought recovery is the least for the same drought return period to explain this observation we further calculate the runoff depth the ratio between drought severity and catchment area for the three basins and we find that the runoff depth of basin 3 is significantly lower than that of basin 1 and basin 2 for the same drought return period especially the return periods from 5a to 50a fig 8 c this shows that different catchment properties can lead to different water requirements for hydrological drought recovery that is hydrological drought propagation is not only related to the climate features but is also affected by the catchment characteristics aghakouchak et al 2015b booth et al 2006 diffenbaugh et al 2015 kuriqi et al 2019 van loon et al 2014 2016 wanders et al 2015 although our proposed method allows us to obtain the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery from a propagation perspective it still has certain limitations for example it is difficult to establish a universal drought index and reasonable drought threshold to monitor and identify all kinds of hydrological drought mishra singh 2010 even though the hai and mai with non standardized features have obvious advantages in obtaining the amount of water required for drought recovery compared to standardized drought indices it makes it difficult to compare the severity of drought in different regions because they do not provide standardized information furthermore we adopt the 0 threshold of ssi as a case to obtain the hai drought threshold d1 although this threshold is conservative and commonly used we cannot claim that this threshold works for most applications further we highlight that using different timescales of drought index may lead to different results mishra singh 2010 moreover hydrological drought recovery is certainly related to rainfall intensity too how to quantify the impact of rainfall intensity on hydrological drought recovery requires further research furthermore global and regional climate forecasts are increasingly being incorporated for hydrologic forecasting zhao et al 2019 2020 we plan to integrate a distributed hydrological model with various climate forcings for early warning of hydrological drought and recovery analysis in our future work 6 conclusions we proposed an approach to determine the amount of runoff required and its corresponding precipitation for a hydrological drought recovery based on drought propagation and non standardized indices we demonstrate the application and performance of the proposed method using three rainfall driven basins with limited human activity located in southern china the main conclusions can be summarized as follows effective management of hydrological drought depends on identification of runoff deficit reliable estimates of its propagation development and recovery process as well as estimates of the water required for its recovery additionally we showed that a linear relationship between the amount of streamflow required and the corresponding precipitation for recovering hydrological drought could be used to obtain the ap required for recovering from a certain hydrological drought however different catchment properties cause the amount of water runoff and the corresponding precipitation required for recovering from a hydrological drought to be different even in basins with similar climatic characteristics the information about the watershed s natural and man made characteristics should be considered for hydrological drought early warning monitoring

5150,when a severe drought occurs people often question the amount of water required to recover from the drought which is difficult to determine here we present a method to determine the amount of water required including both runoff and precipitation for hydrological drought recovery from a drought propagation perspective we also consider multi scale meteorological and hydrological anomaly indices mai and hai with non standardized properties we present three rainfall driven basins in southern china to validate the proposed approach using long term monthly runoff and precipitation records drought propagation characteristics such as duration severity development and recovery processes were extracted using the hai and mai obtained via a threshold level method and run theory the proposed method allows estimating the amount of water required including runoff and the corresponding precipitation for any hydrological drought to recover to normal using hai and mai moreover a linear relationship between runoff and the corresponding precipitation was established r2 0 99 to estimate the amount of precipitation required to recover from a certain hydrological drought the methods presented in this study can be used for assessing and managing water resources and ecosystem response during periods of hydrological drought keywords hydrological drought drought indices

and 3 3 months respectively investigating the relationship between hydrological drought recovery time and catchment characteristics such as elevation storage and land cover of the 52 watersheds in

droughts and their recovery times the amount of water required e g through precipitation for hydrological drought recovery has not been addressed previous studies have analyzed the precipitation required for meteorological drought recovery antofie et al 2015 pan et al 2013 the studies were either based on precipitation shortage during the months preceding drought termination or a particular meteorological drought level value to judge the precipitation required for drought recovery however hydrological drought recovery also includes the gradual accumulation of water in streams and rivers to return to normal rather than being dependent solely on the amount of precipitation ap in the preceding months thus it is worth investigating the water required for hydrological drought recovery from a propagation perspective note that the term water henceforth refers to both the amount of runoff and its corresponding precipitation required for hydrological drought recovery there are several drought indices designed for drought monitoring prediction and water resources management purposes mishra singh 2010 shukla et al 2011 the standardized streamflow index ssi vicente serrano et al 2011 and the standardized runoff index sri shukla wood 2008 evolved from the standardized precipitation index spi widely used for identifying meteorological drought mckee et al 1993 thus ssi and sri share the advantages of spi i e multiple timescales simple calculation and less data input however they do not directly reflect the amount of water required for recovery as they are dimensionless indices streamflow anomaly percentage sap zaidman et al 2002 and streamflow anomaly index sai wang feng 2000 maintain dimensionality properties however they employ a fixed timescale e g monthly or annual and average streamflow as the calculation parameter consequently the cumulative effects of drought for a prolonged event are neglected mishra singh 2010 fixed or variable thresholds based on percentiles of the flow duration curve e g thresholds between the 70th and 90th percentile are also frequently applied to extract hydrological drought characteristics i e duration and severity with non standardized indices van loon et al 2016 overall droughts have multiple timescale features e g 1 month 3 month or 12 month timescales mishra singh 2010 mo lettenmaier 2018 thus a non standardized dimensional index with multiple timescales is required to identify streamflow shortage and the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery therefore this study aims to obtain the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery based on a non standardized dimensional index with multiple timescales we performed three main tasks constructing reliable meteorological and hydrological anomaly indices mai and hai with non standardization and multiple timescales features establishing a method to obtain the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery from the propagation perspective with the mai and hai revealing the relationship between the amounts of runoff required and the corresponding precipitation this paper presents a simple and convenient method for drought identification and estimation of the water required for hydrological drought recovery 2 methodology 2 1 overview the methodological framework proposed in this paper includes two parts fig 1 part 1 construct and validate the hai and mai and part 2 determine the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery the detailed methods for the construction and validation of hai and mai are presented in section 2 2 2 part 1 in fig 1 note that the method for hai and mai construction is consistent with spi and sri which are two widely used standardized meteorological and hydrological drought indices mishra singh 2010 section 2 2 3 part 2 in fig 1 introduces the steps to obtain the amount of water required and corresponding precipitation for recovering hydrological drought based on the mai and hai indices 2 2 hydrological and meteorological anomaly indices part 1 2 2 1 construction of hai and mai step 1 in part 1 the long term runoff and precipitation records for a certain basin were separated in a 2 3 ratio in which the first 66 66 series were used to construct the hai and mai series and the remaining data were used to validate the rationality of the obtained hai and mai series the anomaly of regional runoff during a certain period compared with the average regional runoff obtained over a long period is used to represent the abnormal condition of hydrological drought thus the monthly runoff 30 years records matrix is arranged and combined by months i e time series of the monthly average corresponding to year to obtain the monthly average of runoff the anomaly series of the monthly runoff in the corresponding month are then calculated called the anomaly index ai as follows 1 ai x 1 i x 1 x 2 i x 2 x 12 i x 12 x 1 i 1 x 1 x 2 i 1 x 2 x 12 i 1 x 12 x 1 n x 1 x 2 n x 2 x 12 n x 12 where i and n represent the first and the last years of the time series and 1i 2i 12i are january february december in the first year the rest may be deduced by analogy 1n 2n 12n represents january february december in the last year and x 1 x 2 x 12 represents the monthly average of runoff in a long term time series 30 years because hydrological drought is a cumulative phenomenon resulting from prolonged water shortage mckee et al 1993 shukla wood 2008 hai and mai use a moving window method for different timescales e g 1 3 12 and 24 month timescales for example the 1 month moving cumulative window of ai for runoff is called hai 1 the original ai sequence in eq 1 the 3 month moving cumulative window of ai for runoff is called hai 3 and the successive n month moving window of ai for runoff is called hai n in this paper similarly the steps for constructing the mai with multiple timescales is the same as that of hai however the difference is that the x variable in the eq 1 is changed into the precipitation variable and the x 1 x 2 x 12 is also changed into the long term average of the precipitation per month 2 2 2 determination of thresholds for hai and mai step 2 and 3 in part 1 each drought threshold of hai and mai was obtained using the method of equal probability transformation lloyd hughes saunders 2002 the cumulative distribution frequencies cdf of each drought level were obtained from the sri and spi time series of a certain timescale the thresholds of hai and mai drought levels corresponding to those of sri and spi were then calculated via the equal probability transformation see fig s1 for example assuming that the threshold of sri or spi drought level in a certain timescale is t1 the corresponding cdf1 of hydrological or meteorological drought is transformed into the corresponding timescale of cdf2 for hai or mai in an equivalent manner thus the t2 value of hai or mai corresponding to the cdf2 is a drought threshold of hai or mai the original drought levels of sri and spi are 0 according to previous studies mckee et al 1993 shukla wood 2008 step 2 in part 1 to verify the rationality of hai and mai the different timescales of hai and mai were compared with the corresponding timescales of the widely used multi scale standardized runoff and precipitation indices sri spi step 3 in part 1 mckee et al 1993 shukla wood 2008 we built the hai and mai because they have dimensional features which help us obtain the amount of water shortage directly during a drought 2 3 amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery part 2 the left of fig 2 shows a simple example of the watershed yield according to the water balance of the hydrological cycle for a certain catchment the flow of a river channel is derived from precipitation snowmelt soil moisture groundwater or other sources i e import of water into the watershed in contrast a decrease in the flow is closely related to evaporation transpiration and diversions out of the watershed e g water for human use not shown in fig 2 there are only two aspects of flow change in the river channel rising or falling in other words when the flow in the river is effectively replenished the flow will rise and vice versa the right part of fig 2 flow process shows that the river flow rises or falls when the discharges are replenished or weakened namely the flow in the current month minus that in the preceding month is larger than or less than 0 for example the recharge of flow in a river channel is dependent on precipitation in a rainfall driven basin thus the amount of runoff required and the corresponding precipitation for the hydrological drought recovery should be obtained based on these obtained data we designed a method to determine the amount of water required i e the amount of runoff to recover from the hydrological drought can be directly obtained from the precipitation for making typical hydrological droughts e g 2 year 5 year and 10 year return periods referred to herein as 2a 5a 10a respectively to recover to normal i e the drought index should be larger than the drought threshold which mainly includes the following two steps 2 3 1 describing hydrological drought step 1 in part 2 1 the hydrological drought characteristics are extracted including drought duration d severity s and intensity i using run theory the right part of fig 2 yevjevich 1967 the drought threshold of hai or mai was used to identify the hydrological or meteorological drought characteristics where d is defined as the period from drought start to drought end during which the drought index remains below the truncation level of run theory s is the cumulative drought index during the d and i is the average of s 2 the joint return period between d and s is constructed for example using bivariate fitting functions e g gaussian clayton frank and gumbel in the two dimensional archimedean copula family to examine the return period of hydrological drought characteristics sklar 1959 the bivariate fitting functions are used here because drought has multiple features e g d s and i although d s and i are three important properties of droughts any two of them are sufficient to characterize a single drought tu et al 2018 the parameters for the marginal distribution function and the joint probability distribution function are estimated using the maximum likelihood method the optimal marginal distribution is selected using the kolmogorov smirnov k s test chakravarti et al 1968 and the optimal joint probability distribution is selected through the root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe coefficient n sc and akaike information criterion aic if the values of rmse and aic are small and the value of n sc is large the distance will be minimized between the theoretical and the empirical joint probability distributions of the copula borgomeo et al 2015 thereafter the return period of hydrological drought characteristics is determined based on the optimal archimedean copula function and the typical droughts in the region are identified to help the readers better understand the copula function steps we have described the process in the supporting information 2 3 2 estimate the amount of water required for recovery step 2 in part 2 1 amount of runoff the internal propagation of hydrological drought wu et al 2018a refers to the process of hydrological drought onset and termination onset is defined as the point when the drought index value first decreases such that it is lower higher than the drought threshold e g in the run theory of fig 2 the d1 value is obtained based on the probability of the spi drought threshold the hydrological drought development and recovery periods are defined as the periods from onset the time of drought start tst to maximum intensity pi the maximum absolute value of a drought index in the drought and from pi the time of pi tpi to termination the time of drought termination tdt respectively when the difference between the drought index of the current month and that of the preceding months is greater than d1 the drought is in the normal recovery phase denoted by the solid red line in the run theory of fig 2 however the amount of runoff in the river must be replenished during the current month to maintain recovery otherwise it is a false recovery phenomenon as mentioned above wu et al 2018a in such scenarios the monthly runoff would continue to fall and the drought severity would worsen relative to the preceding month denoted by the dashed red line in the run theory of fig 2 thus the amount of runoff required for hydrological drought recovery is defined as the amount of runoff supply ars required during the recovery period the water supply for the final month of drought recovery the month before the termination of hydrological drought is the difference between the final drought index value and d1 ha i t dt d 1 therefore the ars for recovering hydrological drought is calculated as follows 2 ars h a i t dt d 1 t pi t dt h a i i h a i i 1 h a i i h a i i 1 0 where tpi and tdt are the times of pi and drought termination and i and i 1 represent the current month and the preceding month during the hydrological drought recovery period respectively 2 amount of precipitation the hai and mai values of the current month are affected by the preceding month we account for this by calculating the variation in the current month s i mai or hai value relative to the preceding month s i 1 value i e ma i i m a i i 1 ha i i h a i i 1 for each month within a given year thus the variable of monthly runoff supply required during the hydrological drought recovery period is input into the relationship of the corresponding month and the corresponding amount of the monthly precipitation required is obtained the ap corresponding to the water runoff during the recovery period is regarded as the possible precipitation required for hydrological drought recovery this is because although the runoff supply for a certain river may be affected by various factors van loon et al 2016 it is undeniable that precipitation is a key factor driving hydrological drought recovery particularly in rainfall driven basins tallaksen and van lanen 2004 3 study case and data set we focused on three rainfall driven basins in southern china to demonstrate our methods the yuecheng 531 km2 the xixi 2466 km2 and the jianxi 16 152 km2 river basins fig 3 hereafter the basins will be referred to as basin 1 basin 2 and basin 3 respectively all three basins have unaltered flow no human regulation via reservoir regulation and climatology dominated by humid south asian subtropical monsoons with precipitation and runoff mainly occurring during the warm season fig s2 we used long term 40 years monthly runoff and precipitation records for each region in the analysis the monthly runoff and precipitation records from january 1960 to december 2006 for basin 1 were provided by the water conservancy and electric power bureau in guangdong province in china the monthly runoff and precipitation data spanning january 1960 to december 2010 for basin 2 and from january 1960 to december 2006 for basin 3 were collected by the meteorology agency and water conservation agency of fujian province table 1 the data underwent strict quality control and have been used for previous hydrological and meteorological drought identification research wang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 2018a the control hydrologic stations for basin 1 basin 2 and basin 3 are yuecheng anxi and qilijie respectively we used the simple arithmetic mean method to obtain the basin average monthly precipitation for basins with multiple stations 4 results 4 1 validation of hai and mai the hai and mai values for the varying timescales agree with the corresponding sri and spi results particularly for the 12 and 24 month timescales figs s3 s5 as the values of sri and spi drop the values of hai and mai are also reduced and vice versa in addition the correlation between hai mai and sri spi in the same timescale periods is relatively high 0 70 both in the model development and the validation periods fig 4 this is because the hai and mai are built consistent wtih sri and spi previous studies have also confirmed that sri and spi perform well for identifying hydrological and meteorological drought across the three basins we focus on here wang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 2018a we further used the 3 month hai and mai hai 3 and mai 3 for drought analysis of our selected study areas due to the timescale of the multi seasonal droughts in the region lu wang 2012 we have included additional details within the supporting information that demonstrate the case for obtaining the drought threshold of hai 3 using the equal frequency transform method fig s1 and a summary of the drought levels of hai 3 and mai 3 table s1 4 2 amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery 4 2 1 selection of the appropriate marginal distribution and copula function following the methods described in section 2 3 1 we determined that the log normal distribution function performs better for our study regions relative to the exponential and gamma distributions based on the k s statistics table s2 the dmax for the log normal distribution is smaller than that of the exponential and log normal distributions in general to determine the combined return period of d and s four bivariate fitting functions gaussian clayton frank and gumbel were evaluated using goodness of fit criteria table s3 the minimum values of rmse and aic and the maximum value of n sc are gaussian bivariate distribution functions thus the gaussian function was selected to determine the joint return period of d and s as shown in fig 5 4 2 2 understanding the typical droughts fig 5 illustrates that there is a representative linear relationship between d and s within basin 1 r2 0 79 basin 2 r2 0 91 and basin 3 r2 0 82 the drought characteristics samples are mostly within the 95 of the predictive band of the linear relationship for the three basins as d and s increase the joint return period also shows an increasing trend and the hydrological d and s are different in different return periods which indicate that the drought prevention and mitigation should be performed based on the differences in hydrological conditions at different hydrometric stations additionally different measures must be taken in other parts of the world for fighting against droughts and reducing disasters the typical hydrological droughts fig 5 no 1 no 2 no 3 no 4 and no 5 were selected based on the 2a 5a 10a 25a and 50a return periods as the longest runoff records have 51 years of data basin 2 the selection criteria are proximity to the line grey dashed line of the joint return period and the drought samples are within the 95 prediction band of their linear relationship for basin 1 they are 1989 08 1990 01 d and s are 6 months and 2 62 108 m3 1977 02 1978 03 14 months and 5 10 108 m3 1998 08 1999 09 14 months and 8 29 108 m3 1990 06 1992 01 20 months and 14 46 108 m3 and 2003 05 2005 05 25 months and 15 93 108 m3 respectively meanwhile for basin 2 they are 1986 09 1986 12 4 months and 10 09 108 m3 1991 02 1991 10 9 months and 28 35 108 m3 1967 06 1968 11 18 months and 48 73 108 m3 2003 03 2004 10 20 months and 60 19 108 m3 and 2007 11 2010 01 27 months and 62 61 108 m3 respectively finally for basin 3 they are 1980 06 1980 09 4 months and 58 74 108 m3 1986 06 1987 03 10 months and 133 93 108 m3 1963 02 1963 12 11 months and 173 51 108 m3 1995 11 1997 06 20 months and 291 25 108 m3 and 1971 02 1972 08 23 months and 361 61 108 m3 respectively 4 2 3 water required for hydrological drought recovery in the study basins for each basin the pearson correlation coefficient between hai 3 and mai 3 is relatively high 0 60 fig 6 a this is true for the current month and for the preceding month e g the higher correlation tends to tilt to the lower right of the 1 1 line since s of the current month is a cumulative value based on the preceding month we excluded the effect of s in the preceding months and further analyzed the relationship between hai 3 and mai 3 we found that when the cumulative effects are neglected hai 3 and mai 3 agree well for each individual month s drought severity fig 6 b thus there are 12 linear relationships between the monthly hai 3 and mai 3 within a year after eliminating the effects mentioned above for each basin the detailed linear equation is in table s4 which are then used to obtain the ap required for recovering from hydrological drought according to the design method in section 2 3 2 step 2 part 2 as the return period increases from 2a to 50a the recovery time for hydrological drought also increases the average recovery time is from approximately 2 months to 13 months fig 7 a our results indicate that for basin 1 the amounts of runoff required for recovery of five typical hydrological droughts 2a 5a 10a 25a and 50a are 0 70 108 m3 1 02 108 m3 2 31 108 m3 3 26 108 m3 and 4 25 108 m3 and the corresponding precipitation providing these water quantities are 196 56 mm 250 69 mm 544 23 mm 805 55 mm and 989 65 mm respectively for basin 2 the amounts of runoff required for five typical hydrological droughts are 4 79 108 m3 5 79 108 m3 7 36 108 m3 10 97 108 m3 and 13 17 108 m3 and their corresponding precipitations amounts are 260 93 mm 287 32 mm 387 93 mm 650 88 mm and 816 53 mm respectively for basin 3 they are 20 32 108 m3 26 90 108 m3 38 71 108 m3 48 86 108 m3 and 66 25 108 m3 and corresponding precipitation amounts are 116 59 mm 178 98 mm 265 95 mm 351 66 mm and 499 12 mm respectively as detailed in fig 7b there is a strong linear relationship r2 0 99 between the ars for hydrological drought recovery and the corresponding ap for each of the three basins these linear equations can then be used to obtain the ap required for a certain hydrological drought in each study area 5 discussion the hydrological and meteorological anomaly indices hai and mai developed in this study are non standardized contain multiple timescale properties and are better at identifying the propagation process of regional meteorological and hydrological droughts because they are calculated based on the back stepping method of spi their fluctuations are consistent with sri and spi for the same timescales figs s3 s5 and the correlation between hai mai and sri spi is significant fig 4 hence they can serve to identify and monitor meteorological and hydrological droughts alternatively the amount of water shortage during hydrological drought propagation can be obtained directly via hai whereas sri and spi cannot because they provide standardized values previous studies pan et al 2013 antofie et al 2015 have provided several useful methods for obtaining the ap required for meteorological drought recovery however previous studies cannot estimate the possible precipitation required for hydrological drought recovery estimating the required amount of precipitation for drought recovery however is highly uncertain the studies conducted by pan et al 2013 and antofie et al 2015 were very informative in which they employed the standardized drought index for analyzing the ap required for meteorological drought recovery these studies emphasized the importance of considering the drought propagation process parry et al 2016a wu et al 2018a and not just one specific drought level for a particular month moreover although several recent studies have considered other measures e g water quality and vegetation productivity for investigating drought recovery ahmadi et al 2019 campana et al 2018 schwalm et al 2017 yu et al 2017 the water required for a certain hydrological drought recovering was not considered given the importance of water required for drought recovery for water resource management we have focused on estimating the amount of precipitation for hydrological drought recovery van loon 2015 the results also indicate that the three case studies yuecheng xixi and jianxi river basins differ in the amounts of runoff and precipitation required for recovering from hydrological drought fig 7 which is related to differences in watershed characteristics fig s1 and table s1 on the surface the drought severity in basin 3 appears greater than in basin 2 and basin 1 fig 5 however the corresponding precipitation required for hydrological drought recovery is the least for the same drought return period to explain this observation we further calculate the runoff depth the ratio between drought severity and catchment area for the three basins and we find that the runoff depth of basin 3 is significantly lower than that of basin 1 and basin 2 for the same drought return period especially the return periods from 5a to 50a fig 8 c this shows that different catchment properties can lead to different water requirements for hydrological drought recovery that is hydrological drought propagation is not only related to the climate features but is also affected by the catchment characteristics aghakouchak et al 2015b booth et al 2006 diffenbaugh et al 2015 kuriqi et al 2019 van loon et al 2014 2016 wanders et al 2015 although our proposed method allows us to obtain the amount of water required for hydrological drought recovery from a propagation perspective it still has certain limitations for example it is difficult to establish a universal drought index and reasonable drought threshold to monitor and identify all kinds of hydrological drought mishra singh 2010 even though the hai and mai with non standardized features have obvious advantages in obtaining the amount of water required for drought recovery compared to standardized drought indices it makes it difficult to compare the severity of drought in different regions because they do not provide standardized information furthermore we adopt the 0 threshold of ssi as a case to obtain the hai drought threshold d1 although this threshold is conservative and commonly used we cannot claim that this threshold works for most applications further we highlight that using different timescales of drought index may lead to different results mishra singh 2010 moreover hydrological drought recovery is certainly related to rainfall intensity too how to quantify the impact of rainfall intensity on hydrological drought recovery requires further research furthermore global and regional climate forecasts are increasingly being incorporated for hydrologic forecasting zhao et al 2019 2020 we plan to integrate a distributed hydrological model with various climate forcings for early warning of hydrological drought and recovery analysis in our future work 6 conclusions we proposed an approach to determine the amount of runoff required and its corresponding precipitation for a hydrological drought recovery based on drought propagation and non standardized indices we demonstrate the application and performance of the proposed method using three rainfall driven basins with limited human activity located in southern china the main conclusions can be summarized as follows effective management of hydrological drought depends on identification of runoff deficit reliable estimates of its propagation development and recovery process as well as estimates of the water required for its recovery additionally we showed that a linear relationship between the amount of streamflow required and the corresponding precipitation for recovering hydrological drought could be used to obtain the ap required for recovering from a certain hydrological drought however different catchment properties cause the amount of water runoff and the corresponding precipitation required for recovering from a hydrological drought to be different even in basins with similar climatic characteristics the information about the watershed s natural and man made characteristics should be considered for hydrological drought early warning monitoring

5151,to build future climate proof water systems and to reduce the failure risk of infrastructure short duration extreme precipitation design storms must be updated however a robust future projection of such storms on a continental scale has not been presented due to the scarcity of long high quality sub daily data both for observations and model simulations to address this need we develop current and future precipitation intensity duration frequency idf curves for europe for 0 5 1 3 6 12 and 24 hour durations and for different return periods ranging between 1 and 100 years derived from a generalized pareto distribution gpd future idf curves are developed in the framework of the quantile perturbation downscaling method by applying climate change signals from the euro cordex rcms on current idf curves obtained from high resolution remote sensing based products here we show that rarer sub daily extreme precipitation events will intensify more than less rare events and that changes may depend on precipitation duration the frequency of sub daily extreme precipitation events of 50 and 100 year return periods will be tripled under the high end rcp8 5 scenario such intensification will lead to a substantial uplift 16 27 depending on duration and return period and steepening 17 25 depending on return period of the idf curves under future climate change calling attention to the vulnerability of the existing water infrastructure systems keywords idf curves sub daily precipitation gpd parameters regional climate model uncertainty 1 introduction flash floods caused by short intense rainstorms are amongst earth s most common costliest and destructive weather related hazards leading to loss of life or property and destruction of infrastructure gaume et al 2009 papagiannaki et al 2015 willner et al 2018 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020 they are more likely to happen in urban areas with fast runoff processes and short response times because of a greater prevalence of impermeable surfaces mishra et al 2012 they in turn lead to cross sectoral cascading infrastructure system failures because of extensive interdependencies in urban areas threatening human health and local economies wilbanks and fernandez 2014 penny et al 2018 the design of flood control structures and urban water infrastructure is typically based on the statistical properties of extreme precipitation in the form of intensity duration frequency idf curves which quantify the frequency of occurrence of a given precipitation intensity over a range of time scales or temporal durations hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 2018 yan et al 2018 boukhelifa et al 2018 the idf curves also have important implications for other infrastructure vulnerable to heavy precipitation such as land based transportation systems e g streets and railways kermanshah et al 2017 electricity and telecommunication networks and those related to river floods and landslides nissen and ulbrich 2017 the idf relationships and design criteria are usually developed for a single and specific location based on historical precipitation data raingauge data provide the most accurate liquid precipitation rain estimates and thereby the most accurate design criteria in rainfall dominated areas and seasons nevertheless raingauge measurements are affected by systematic errors such as underestimations due to wind induced undercatch which is much larger when precipitation turns into snow grossi et al 2017 and to heating related losses in tipping bucket gauges for snowfall measurements savina et al 2012 the availability of long high quality gauge records is also restricted in some regions lumbroso et al 2011 vu et al 2018 libertino et al 2019 further the spatial pattern of precipitation cannot be captured using a sparse gauging network courty et al 2019 the scarcity of long term precipitation records of high temporal resolution is another restriction for engineering practice and infrastructure design e g for flash flood events which are of a short duration of several minutes to a few hours berne et al 2004 in fact daily precipitation cannot capture the life cycle of single storms and masks the effect of more intense precipitation at sub daily time scales singleton and toumi 2013 thanks to high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing based precipitation products we are now able to estimate the design storms in ungauged regions and to capture intergauge gradients and to analyze the large scale regional continental and global spatial structure of extreme precipitation to explore different orographic and climatic drivers of such events sun et al 2018 nguyen et al 2019 marra et al 2019 caution should however be exercised when comparing raingauge and gridded data based idf curves because of the scale mismatch between point gauge observations and grid average estimates maraun 2013 tabari et al 2016 recent generations of remotely sensed datasets have been developed by merging satellite estimates with gauge and reanalysis data to provide global precipitation estimates that have uniform reliability both spatially and temporally beck et al 2017 2019 accordingly satellite based precipitation has more recently been utilized in a handful number of studies to develop idf curves but with a focus on current climate conditions small regions and or daily precipitation gado et al 2017 marra et al 2017 ombadi et al 2018 courty et al 2019 the lack of sub daily precipitation is also an issue for future assessments of extreme precipitation as climate model data are very limited at sub daily scales olsson et al 2015 hence future changes in sub daily extreme precipitation especially on larger spatial scales are less quantified this is particularly important as the changes in sub daily extreme precipitation under anthropogenic forcing can be greater than those in daily extremes hanel and buishand 2010 molnar et al 2015 tabari et al 2016 miao et

by local authorities and decision makers simonovic et al 2017 practical development of the future idf curves is complicated because of the aforementioned limitations in view of these limitations in

precipitation outputs from the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep are used in conjunction with 3 hourly 12 km precipitation simulations from the coordinated downscaling experiment over europe euro cordex jacob et al 2014 climate models to estimate current and future climate idf curves for europe precipitation intensities for different return periods ranging between 1 and 100 years are calculated by fitting a generalized pareto distribution gpd to the partial duration series for different storm durations ranging between 0 5 and 24 h a bayesian inference based differential evolution markov chain de mc approach is used for estimation of the gpd distribution parameters and associated uncertainties the future idf curves are derived by applying climate change signals on the current climate idf curves in the framework of the quantile perturbation downscaling method 2 materials and methods the overall methodological framework adopted in this study contains three main parts data preprocessing extreme value analysis and idf curve development fig 1 2 1 data 2 1 1 observation datasets two high resolution datasets are used to develop current climate idf curves and base the presentation of future curves after applying climate change impacts the selected datasets are cmorph and mswep these datasets were selected based on their spatial resolution temporal scale quality bias corrected and length the cmorph precipitation products with the finest temporal and spatial resolutions amongst satellite datasets wang et al 2019 have been shown by numerous studies to have a comparable precision with ground based observations zeweldi and gebremichael 2009 the cmorph dataset has been derived from propagated low orbiter passive satellite microwave pmw observations by motion vectors resulting from geostationary satellite infrared imagery joyce et al 2004 it covers the global domain from 60 s to 60 n quasi global coverage with precipitation data in a half hourly interval over grid sizes of 0 073 0 073 or 8 km at the equator from 1 january 1998 onwards the new version of cmorph produces cmorphv1 0 2015 for the period 1998 2017 which is bias corrected against ncep cpc daily precipitation at nearly 30 000 raingauges around the world xie et al 2017 is used in this study this new version provides more accurate precipitation estimates and reduced spurious trends and biases in comparison to the original version gehne et al 2016 mswep dataset also has a high accuracy with their best overall performance among 26 precipitation datasets evaluated against gauge data beck et al 2019 it is a fully global precipitation dataset obtained from merging precipitation data from different sources of gauge satellite and reanalysis beck et al 2017 we use version 2 1 of this dataset with a 3 hourly temporal resolution and 0 1 12 km spatial resolution for the period 1979 2016 in addition to the cmorph and mswep datasets daily precipitation data from the e obs v20 0e dataset with 0 1 12 km spatial resolution for the period from 1950 01 01 to 2019 07 31 are used to quantify the bias in estimation of high quantiles with short records the unique high quality 10 min precipitation data recorded with the same instrument for the period 1901 2000 at uccle near brussels and hourly precipitation data for the period 1951 2020 at de bilt de kooy eelde flushing and volkel stations in the netherlands are used to scrutinize the bias in the estimation of the high quantiles with short records to evaluate the performance of the quantile perturbation downscaling method and to assess the calibration of the extreme value distributions 2 1 2 climate model simulations for developing future idf curves climate change signals are calculated using the euro cordex regional climate models rcms simulations climate simulations of the euro cordex rcms have been produced by a dynamically downscaling of the global climate model gcm simulations from the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 the downscaled euro cordex climate simulations have spatial resolutions of 0 44 50 km and 0 11 12 5 km and temporal resolutions of daily and 3 hourly it is expected that the higher resolution of the rcms improves the representation of meso scale processes associated with the formation of extreme precipitation as well as orographic features tabari and willems 2018 as higher resolution precipitation is more relevant for hydrological impact studies of climate change we use the finest resolutions of the euro cordex rcms 3 hourly temporal resolution and 0 11 spatial resolution these high resolution simulations for the euro cordex domain are only available for the rca4 rcm developed at the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi strandberg et al 2014 the rcms simulations are driven by mpi esm lr cnrm cm5 hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a mr and ec earth gcms from the cmip5 project the period 1971 2000 is considered as the reference period and climate change signals are evaluated for medium 2041 2070 and far 2071 2100 future periods with respect to the reference period under two representative concentration pathways rcps moss et al 2010 of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 rcp8 5 corresponds to a pathway with the highest emission level in which radiative forcing reaches 8 5 w m2 at the end of the century riahi et al 2011 while rcp4 5 is a stabilization scenario that stabilizes radiative forcing at 4 5 w m2 thomson et al 2011 2 2 extreme value analysis two main sampling methods for extreme value analysis are annual maxima and peak over threshold pot also called partial duration series the pot method provides a larger extreme precipitation data sample for a more accurate estimation of distribution parameters yilmaz et al 2017 marra et al 2019 the pot analysis also allows for a more rational selection of extreme events instead of considering only one event per year in the annual maxima method lang et al 1999 as the second or even higher order extremes in some years can be larger than the annual extremes in other years pasarić and cindrić 2019 the threshold method also works quite well when the tails of distributions are asymmetric mcneil and frey 2000 despite the aforementioned advantages of the pot method most of the previous studies have applied the annual maxima method pombo and de oliveira 2015 ombadi et al 2018 faridzad et al 2018 the results are hereafter shown using the pot framework however to characterize the extreme value distribution uncertainty precipitation extremes are also analyzed using the annual maxima method based on the gev for the pot selection the extreme value threshold and inter event time are the main criteria willems 2009 the threshold for extreme precipitation values is chosen high enough equal to the 98th percentile of all days to include only extreme values more relevant for pluvial flooding and to ensure reliable tail asymptotics underlying the distribution approximation and whereby reducing the related bias scarrott and macdonald 2012 the percentile of all daily precipitation values rather than wet days is chosen to avoid the effects of varying number of wet days in europe on the percentile level fischer knutti 2015 higher thresholds reduce the sample size of extremes thus increasing the variance of the parameter estimates scarrott and macdonald 2012 the inter event time defines dependency of subsequent extreme events i e serial correlation in the time series which results from the duration of mesoscale rainstorm events willems et al 2007 to ensure that the extremes are taken from independent events the maximum sub daily precipitation per day is considered to find the best distribution to pot series we fit 16 distributions birnbaum saunders exponential extreme value gamma generalized extreme value generalized pareto inverse gaussian logistic log logistic log normal nakagami normal rayleigh rician t location scale and weibull to over three million pot series examined in this study the distribution with the lowest bayesian information criterion bic is chosen as the best fitted distribution the results indicate that the pot series in all the datasets cmorph mswep and euro cordex can be approximated most accurately with a generalized pareto distribution gpd fig 2 a this is in agreement with previous studies katz et al 2002 renard et al 2006 lazoglou et al 2019 the percentage of the pot series with gpd as the best fitting distribution ranges between 94 7 for the rcm simulations under rcp8 5 to 99 9 for the historical rcm simulations fig 2b shows that the spatial distribution of the bic of the best fitted model has a south north bipolar pattern based on these results we use the gpd for the pot series the standard cumulative distribution function of the gpd is defined by 1 f ζ μ σ x 1 1 ζ x μ σ 1 ζ for ζ 0 1 exp x μ σ for ζ 0 the gpd distribution is characterized by three parameters including location µ scale σ and shape ζ of the distribution describing the center of distribution the deviation around the mean and the tail behavior of the distribution respectively embrechts et al 1997 according to the shape parameter three extreme distributions are defined as pareto exponential and beta corresponding to ζ 0 ζ 0 and ζ 0 respectively the return level xp i e the value that is expected to be exceeded once every t years on average associated with the return period 1 p for the chosen threshold u is given by 2 x p u σ ζ 1 p ζ u 1 for ζ 0 u σ log 1 p ζ u for ζ 0 the parameters of the selected distribution are estimated classically by various parametric e g probability weighted moment maximum likelihood and two step and three step estimators and semi parametric e g moment hill and pickands estimators methods aghakouchak and nasrollahi 2010 however these classical methods do not take into account the uncertainty associated with the point estimate of parameters rupa et al 2015 bayesian method has the capability to reasonably address the uncertainties in the estimation of parameters mélèse et al 2018 another advantage of the bayesian method is its feasibility in non regular likelihood cases e g short tail of the parent population from which the data is drawn rupa et al 2015 let us consider x x1 x2 xn as the set of n pot values extracted from the precipitation time series and θ as the parameter of a given distribution following the bayes theorem the posterior distributions are estimated based on knowledge of the prior distribution and the observation vector as renard et al 2006 3 p θ x i 1 n p θ p x i θ in our case θ is a vector containing the gpd distribution parameters 4 p μ σ ζ x i 1 n p μ p σ p ζ p x i μ σ ζ the priors prior knowledge of analysts about parameters are non informative normal distributions for the location and scale parameters and a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0 3 for the shape parameter as suggested in renard et al 2006 and cheng et al 2014 the differential evolution markov chain de mc with a metropolis hastings sampler haario et al 1999 2001 is then applied to sample a large number of realizations in our case 5000 iterations including 2000 burn in iterations from the gpd parameters posterior distributions in fact the de is used for a global optimization over the parameter space with the markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach by proposing candidate values for the posterior distribution ter braak 2006 vrugt et al 2009 the de mc with a higher convergence speed is faster than the conventional mcmc ter braak 2006 to assess convergence of the sampling approach we use the r criterion gelman and shirley 2011 with the upper limit of 1 1 cheng et al 2014 ragno et al 2018 merging bayesian inference with de mc allows the derivation of the confidence interval and uncertainty bounds of estimated extreme precipitation intensities for idf curves based on the sampled parameters to assess the influence of the distribution parameter estimation method the parameters are also estimated using the maximum likelihood method 2 3 development of idf curves we analyze sub daily precipitation data for a whole year from the observations and the control and scenario simulations of the rcms to obtain the pot time series for individual native grid cells of each dataset in the european domain we then aggregate 0 5 hr precipitation for each grid cell into accumulations of non overlapping 1 3 6 12 and 24 hr periods and the gpd is fitted to the pot precipitation values for the selected storm durations the duration of precipitation events for the mswep dataset and the rcms simulations is constrained to the range of 3 24 h as their finest time resolution is 3 hourly different precipitation intensities are estimated for different return periods t from 1 to 100 years while the results for the selected t of 2 10 50 and 100 years and the respected durations for each dataset are used for plotting the idf curves in addition to the bic statistical measure the goodness of fit of the gpd model is visually assessed by comparing the probability distribution function of the observed and theoretical gpd based pot values we consider gpd simulations reliable when the envelope 90 confidence interval of the de mc simulations encompasses all of the empirical return levels with a closer median of the simulated ensemble to the empirical values as a better goodness of fit once the gpd is fitted to the observed and modeled extreme precipitation future idf curves are developed using the quantile perturbation downscaling method willems 2013 numerous hydrological impact studies of climate change have found this method superior to simpler methods that correct the bias only in mean or mean and variance of precipitation series gudmundsson et al 2012 teutschbein and seibert 2012 chen et al 2013 applying the corrections per quantile in our case return periods ranging between 1 and 100 years maintains distinct bias of climate models for different quantiles the quantile perturbation method necessitates regridding the observations and rcm grid sizes to a common rectangular grid the regridding is performed by a bilinear interpolation method afterwards quantile specific bias correction factors are calculated for each duration and individual grid cell over europe by assuming that the systematic bias of climate models to be corrected is temporally stationary the bias correction factors derived from historical simulations for each grid cell are applied on future simulations of the same cell cannon et al 2015 the assumption ensures that the changes in quantiles are unaffected by the bias correction this process is performed for each climate model run and rcp separately thus preserving the sensitivity of the models to external forcings and allowing a climate model uncertainty quantification the bias corrected quantiles in the future simulations are used to develop future idf curves due to the unavailability of 0 5 and 1 hr precipitation results in the euro cordex simulations 3 hourly rcm simulations are bias corrected based on 0 5 and 1 hr cmorph quantiles to derive future quantiles for the respected durations in this way the bias correction factors involve both the systematic bias of the climate model results and the temporal disaggregation ratio the latter can also be seen as temporal statistical downscaling the temporal disaggregation ratio for 30 min hourly duration is obtained at each model grid over europe by comparing 3 hourly and 30 min hourly precipitation quantiles from gridded observations for the same return period to validate the downscaling results the 3 hourly historical euro cordex simulations for the period 1971 2000 are downscaled based on hourly observations at some stations with long term records for the same period using the quantile perturbation method afterwards the bias correction factors are applied on the rcp8 5 simulations for the same quantiles and at respected station s location for the period 2006 2019 in the investigation of the future changes in the form of idf curves the changes in the intensity of extreme precipitation are translated into the changes in the ordinate of the curves either upward or downward shift for the changes in the slope of idf curves the ratios of the slope of extreme precipitation with durations between the current and future climates for individual grid cells are calculated for different return periods between 1 and 100 years we also assess the uncertainty in projected extreme precipitation changes for different durations and return periods the changes in extreme precipitation are computed as the ratio of the values for the future period 2041 2070 or 2071 2100 over those for the historical period 1971 2000 the total uncertainty includes the uncertainties associated with the choice of climate models five euro cordex rcm members emission scenarios rcp4 5 rcp8 5 extreme value distributions gpd gev and distribution parameter estimation methods de mc maximum likelihood to quantify the uncertainty propagated due to emission scenarios hereafter scenario uncertainty we estimate the variability across rcps here characterized by the standard deviation after taking the median of the changes derived from different climate model runs extreme value distributions and distribution parameter estimation methods a similar procedure is adopted to quantify the uncertainties related to climate model runs hereafter model uncertainty extreme value distributions hereafter distribution uncertainty and distribution parameter estimation methods hereafter parameter uncertainty the fractional uncertainty is finally calculated as a ratio of the uncertainty of each source to the total uncertainty which is the sum of the variations due to all the four uncertainty sources 2 4 high quantile estimation bias from short records the larger the extrapolation beyond the record length the less reliable is the return level a common rule of thumb in conventional at site quantile estimates is to restrict extrapolation to return periods of up to twice the record length kidson and richards 2005 however for making an estimate of a 100 year event we extrapolate quantiles larger than twice as long as the record length in order to quantify the related bias in estimation of high quantiles from short records i e extrapolated quantiles using the gpd the estimated quantiles from short and long records are compared for individual grid cells to this end an extrapolation ratio is first defined as the ratio of return periods t to the record length l because the cmorph dataset has the shortest record among the considered datasets in our study a 20 year length is used as the denominator of the extrapolation ratio for all datasets the bias in high quantiles is then calculated by dividing the quantiles estimated from the full time series for specific return periods over those from a 20 year sub series for the same return periods for each dataset the upper limit of return periods is equal to the length of the full time series to avoid extrapolation bias in the long record which is used as the benchmark for example for the e obs data the quantiles estimated from the full e obs data with a 70 year length 1950 2019 for the return periods between 20 and 70 years are divided over those from a sub series of the e obs data with a 20 year length 2000 2019 for the same return periods afterwards the bias is plotted against the extrapolation ratios which range between 1 and 3 5 for the e obs dataset t l when l 20 and t 20 21 22 70 see fig 9a similar analyses are performed using 3 hourly mswep and 30 min uccle raingauge data in the former the bias is obtained by comparing the quantiles between 38 1979 2016 and 20 1997 2016 year data and in the latter between 100 1901 2000 and 20 1981 2000 year data the extrapolation ratios range between 1 and 1 9 for mswep dataset l 20 and t 20 21 22 38 and between 1 and 5 for uccle raingauge data l 20 and t 20 21 22 100 we also analyze the bias in terms of the shape parameter of the gpd by comparing the parameter value between short and long records 3 results 3 1 changes in the probability distribution of short duration extreme precipitation the gpd is fitted separately to extreme precipitation at each grid cell of each dataset and for each storm duration considered the distribution parameters for different storm durations derived from cmorph and mswep datasets are shown in fig 3 the location parameters representing the mean of the distribution from cmorph are larger than the ones from mswep and the difference gets smaller with increasing rainstorm durations fig 3a a larger location parameter from cmorph means higher extreme value estimates from this dataset spatially the location parameter has larger variations over europe for longer duration intensities that are more pronounced in mswep table s1 this is because the spatial patterns in the longer duration intensities become more visible due to the lower uncertainties less random scatter spatially compared to the shorter duration intensities the climate change impact assessment using the high resolution euro cordex rcm ensemble indicates that the location parameter will increase all over europe 97 of the area figs s1 and s2 by a continental average change of 10 and 17 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the projected changes go up to 32 and 48 in some areas for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively furthermore the changes in the location parameter are roughly independent of the duration fig 3b in contrast to the location parameter the scale parameter representing the dispersion of the distribution is smaller in cmorph compared to mswep fig 3c with the spatial median values ranging between 0 12 and 0 09 for 3 hr to 24 hr durations for the former and around 0 14 for the latter the scale parameter decreases with storm duration in both datasets particularly in cmorph from 0 17 to 0 09 fig 3c similarly its spatial variation also decreases with duration table s1 the spatial variation patterns of the location and scale parameters over europe show some similarities figs s1 and s2 pointing to a larger variability for higher extreme values over europe the scale parameter is expected to increase under climate change in 98 of the european area at a higher rate compared to the location parameter figs s1 and s2 accounting for continental averaged increases of 11 and 17 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the signals of relative increase in the scale parameter reach 57 and 79 in some locations for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the projected increase in the scale parameter means that climate change will widen the distribution of extreme precipitation indicating an amplified variability of extreme precipitation in the warmer world an increase in mean daily precipitation variability has been shown before for a majority of global land area in response to warming pendergrass et al 2017 kharin et al 2018 he and li 2019 the larger spread of the distribution is caused by the larger magnitudes of change in extreme precipitation for higher intensities return periods see our results in the next section the future changes in the scale parameter slightly decrease with increasing storm duration accounting for 13 9 and 5 3 differences in the spatial 90th and 50th percentiles of changes between 3 hourly and daily intensities for rcp8 5 rcp4 5 fig 3d the median shape parameter over europe for all storm durations and for both datasets is positive with values ranging between 0 06 and 0 13 for different durations suggesting a heavy tailed distribution for extreme precipitation over europe fig 3e the positive shape parameter is observed over 94 of the european area for 0 5 hr extreme precipitation and is within the range of 78 92 for multi hourly extreme precipitation figs s1 and s2 similar to the location parameter but with a much lesser extent the shape parameter in both datasets decreases when moving from short to long durations fig 3e implying that the tail of the distribution becomes less heavy for longer duration intensities a positive shape parameter has also been previously reported for daily gauge extreme precipitation based on the generalized extreme value gev distribution koutsoyiannis 2004 ragulina and reitan 2017 with a global average of 0 093 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 the median shape parameters from our continental analysis for cmorph are 0 13 0 11 0 09 0 08 0 07 and 0 06 for 0 5 1 3 6 12 24 hr storm durations respectively the mswep shape parameters tend to be larger for the corresponding durations fig 3e comparing the spatial variation of the shape parameter between the two datasets shows higher values for cmorph figs s1 and s2 the spatial variation of the shape parameter is the highest among the gpd parameters for all durations and both datasets table s1 projections from the euro cordex rcm ensemble show an increase in the shape parameter but not as widespread as that in the location and scale parameters fig 3f the increase is indeed projected for 61 63 of the continental area figs s1 and s2 making the tail of the distribution heavier for short duration extreme precipitation in the future similar to the location parameter the changes in the shape parameter are shown to be independent of the storm duration fig 3f 3 2 changes in the intensity and frequency of short duration extreme precipitation the climate change projections show that 3 hr extreme precipitation will increase for all return periods under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 fig 4 a b the longer the return period and the shorter the duration the larger is the change fig 4a b the dependency of the changes on the return period is more pronounced compared to the duration in agreement with previous studies kharin et al 2018 cannon and innocenti 2019 the results suggest that rarer extreme precipitation events will intensify more than less rare events and that changes may depend on event duration a greater intensification of rarer extremes is attributed to the increase in the dispersion of the gpd distribution shown in fig 3d the median of the expected changes over europe for rcp8 5 rcp4 5 ranges between 20 12 and 27 20 depending on the return period in some areas the intensity of 100 year short duration precipitation will be about doubled at the end of the 21st century with increases of 95 and 122 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig s3 s14 the expected return periods under future climatic conditions of 3 and 24 hr extreme precipitation events historically associated with return periods of 50 and 100 years are shown in fig 4c d the frequency of such events medianed over the continent will be doubled in the future under rcp4 5 and tripled under rcp8 5 in fact 3 hr daily extreme events expected to occur every 50 years would occur every 25 27 and 18 19 years for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively similarly 3 hr daily 100 year precipitation would occur more frequently every 50 53 and 33 35 years in the future under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively our overall conclusion is that short duration extreme precipitation will be intensified at a greater rate compared to long duration storms thus supporting the results of the previous studies regarding a super clausius clapeyron scaling of sub daily extreme precipitation with warming e g mishra et al 2012 the spatial distribution of the changes shows that the 3 hourly extreme precipitation increases over almost the entire domain while the increase is generally larger for the eastern half longitudes 5 fig s3 s14 the changes in daily extreme precipitation follow a similar spatial pattern but with a smaller magnitude which turns into a decreasing signal for 2 year extremes over the southern part of europe the extreme precipitation changes for the medium future period 2041 2070 are also increasing for all return periods and durations fig 5 as expected the amount of changes is smaller for the medium future period compared to the far future 2071 2100 period however the spatial distribution of the changes is similar fig s15 16 the change difference between the two future horizons is larger for rcp8 5 in comparison to rcp4 5 fig 5 for rcp4 5 the changes for the far future period are about 37 65 larger than those for the medium future period depending on duration and return period while it increases to 54 74 for rcp8 5 the model uncertainty also increases with lead time being larger for the far future period fig 5 the sensitivity of the climate change signals to the method for extreme value analysis annual maxima vs pot and the related extreme value distribution selected gev vs gpd is also investigated see the signals computed based on the gev in fig s17 s19 the results show a good consistency between the extreme precipitation changes derived from gev and gpd although the changes by gev are slightly larger for rcp8 5 fig s17 3 3 towards building future climate proof infrastructure to reduce the failure risk of infrastructure and design a reliable and durable construction they should be resilient to future climate change to build such a future climate proof infrastructure the design storms estimated from the idf curves should be revised to adapt the infrastructure to a changing climate through implementing adaptation actions as the failure of different types of infrastructure occurs at different precipitation thresholds and even for each type there is no universal critical value over europe nissen and ulbrich 2017 the expected changes in common return periods for infrastructure design i e rainstorms of 2 10 50 and 100 year return periods are analyzed future extreme precipitation values are obtained by applying climate change signals on historical extreme precipitation in the framework of the quantile perturbation downscaling method our results indicate that the quantile perturbation method performs well in correcting the bias in future quantiles from model simulations fig s20 the future short duration precipitation maps for different return periods are presented in figs 6 and s21 from which the failure risk of different infrastructure types with different thresholds for all areas within europe can be obtained e g between 10 and 20 year return periods for urban drainage systems willems et al 2012 or 10 year return period for the international union for railways uic 2008 for example the spatial 95th and 50th percentiles of 0 5 hr 100 year precipitation depth over the continent under present day climate conditions are 99 and 66 mm hr that will increase to 127 and 82 mm hr by the end of the century for the high end rcp8 5 scenario fig 6 the expected increase in the frequency and intensity of short duration precipitation compromises the resilience of infrastructure designed and constructed based on the current climate idf curves fig 7 illustrates the current and future downscaled idf curves for 2 and 100 year storms for some european locations under rcp8 5 along with distribution parameter and climate change uncertainties the best fitting distribution in all locations is the gpd whose probability distribution function has a good match with that of the empirical distribution figs s22 s24 the future idf curves in the six selected locations are developed by applying climate change signals on the current idf curves fig 7 a comparison between the current and future idf curves reveals an upward shift and a steepening of the curves in the future in all the locations our plots also show that the parameter estimation uncertainty is larger for longer return periods e g because of larger sampling errors cheng et al 2015 and even in some cases the lower bound of the future climate intensity falls within the observation confidence interval bounds related to the uncertainty of the gpd parameter estimation by the de mc approach the overall uplift and steepening are also found for idf relationships at the continental scale which are larger for rcp8 5 compared to rcp4 5 fig 8 the magnitudes of the changes in the ordinate and slope of idf curves are comparable with larger ordinate changes in 3 and 6 hourly extreme precipitation and smaller ordinate changes for 12 and 24 hourly extremes the uplift is due to the intensification of extreme precipitation under climate change fig 4a b the steepening of idf curves is attributed to the larger increase of shorter duration extremes fig 4a b the steepening of idf curves grows with return periods from 17 10 for 1 year extreme precipitation to 25 16 for 100 year events under rcp8 5 rcp4 5 the upward shift in idf curves ranges between 16 9 and 27 18 under rcp8 5 rcp4 5 increasing gradually with return period and decreasing with duration fig 8 in order to quantify the uncertainty of the quantile estimates from short records we compare high quantiles between the full time series of the e obs 70 year data and mswep 38 year data over the entire european domain as well as uccle raingauge 100 year data with those from a sub sample with a 20 year length equal to the length of the cmorph time series as the shortest series examined fig 9 the results show that short records in all datasets underestimate extreme precipitation and the amount of the underestimation increases with the extrapolation ratio fig 9a the bias increment with the extrapolation ratio is more evident for the century long 0 5 hr raingauge data for the mswep data the bias in high quantile estimations by short records is slightly larger for a shorter duration the underestimation of daily quantiles by short records is less than 6 while it may go up to 30 for sub daily quantiles our results are in contrast to the findings of marra et al 2017 for a small study area in the eastern mediterranean they found an overestimation of the idf values with short records which decreases with the time aggregation of precipitation our results also reveal that the underestimation of extreme precipitation quantiles from short records mainly stems from the underestimation of the gpd shape parameter fig 9 b care should however be taken in generalizing the underestimation of the gpd shape parameter by short records to other regions and time periods from a multi decadal climate oscillation perspective the location of the 20 year period in an oscillation high or an oscillation low period may change the results quantifying the climate change uncertainty over the entire europe reveal a clear dependency of the total uncertainty on the return period the longer the return period the larger the uncertainty not shown a larger uncertainty in the projected changes of more extreme precipitation has also been reported in a recent study by tabari et al 2019 the increase of uncertainty with the extreme precipitation rarity is found for all four uncertainty components the total uncertainty as well as the uncertainty of individual components also depends on the duration the shorter the duration the larger the uncertainty the dependency of the uncertainty to duration is more pronounced in the model and scenario uncertainties than in the distribution and parameter uncertainties the total uncertainty in projected extreme precipitation changes decomposed into its main sources is shown in fig 10 due to different gradients of the absolute uncertainties of the components with return period the relative contribution of model and scenario uncertainties is decreasing with return period while that of distribution and parameter uncertainties is increasing with return period models and scenarios with comparable uncertainty magnitudes ranging between 36 and 46 provide the largest uncertainties parameter and distribution uncertainties have the lowest contributions to the total uncertainty in extreme precipitation changes respectively the parameter and distribution contributions are within the range of 8 15 and 5 12 respectively 4 discussion unlike previous studies which have focused on relatively small domains current climate conditions and daily precipitation e g marra et al 2017 ombadi et al 2018 courty et al 2019 this study provides future idf curves at a continental scale based on high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing based precipitation products cmorph and mswep and sub daily precipitation simulations from the euro cordex rcms the climate change impact analysis on extreme precipitation revealed an intensification of extreme precipitation with a larger intensification of rarer extreme events compared to less rare events this is in agreement with earlier studies kharin et al 2018 cannon and innocenti 2019 the intensification is to a lesser extent larger for shorter duration events the results also pointed to a threefold increase in the frequency of occurrence of sub daily extreme precipitation intensities for 50 and 100 year return periods under the high end rcp8 5 scenario relative to past events a comparison between the historical and future idf curves implies a large uplift and steepening of these curves under climate change the upward shift and steepening of future idf curves were also observed over north america cannon and innocenti 2019 the expected changes in idf curves call into question the resilience of the existing infrastructure systems under more frequent and intense rainstorms in the future this is of particular importance in urban areas where the failure risk can be cascaded owing to extensive interconnections between different infrastructure systems hence in order to create resilient societies the breakdown risk of infrastructure systems designed based on historical rainstorms and dependent subsystems in urban areas must be reduced by proper adaptation strategies to avoid lock in inflexible strategies and decrease the risk of decision failure regarding the evolving nature of risks over time capacity building win win or low regret synergy options or iterative adaptation pathways must be undertaken this study also investigated the uncertainty in future projections of extreme precipitation and idf curves across different durations and return periods which has not been quantified at such scales in previous studies the results showed that the future projections of idf curves are subject to a large uncertainty the uncertainty increases with rainstorm extremity and decreases with duration the large uncertainty in the future projections calls for a flexible and iterative adaptation approach based on a framework for decision making under uncertainty adaptation pathways and so called adaptive management this kind of adaptations can be iteratively updated by taking the advantages of new information and feedbacks and the lessons learned from the success and failure of actions the uncertainties in projected extreme precipitation changes associated with climate models emission scenarios extreme value distributions and parameter estimation methods were quantified in this study model and scenario uncertainties were found to be the dominant sources there also exist other uncertainty sources such as the downscaling and bias correction method uncertainty whose quantification needs further investigation two commonly used distributions for extreme value analysis and development of idf curves i e gpd and gev were used here however other types of distributions such as pearson iii have also been used to derive idf curves in some studies the inclusion of such distributions in future work can improve the uncertainty analysis of extreme value distributions this study made use of 3 hourly precipitation simulations from 12 km rcms for the climate change impact assessment nevertheless summer sub hourly precipitation extremes are usually produced by convective storms that cannot be well modelled by rcms because of their coarse spatial and temporal resolutions the convection permitting climate models cpms models with a spatial resolution 4 km are therefore required to more realistically represent local and short duration storm dynamics and reliably project future changes relevant for urban hydrology over europe the fine scale simulations from such models are however still rare and limited to few modeling centers due to their high computational expenses future research directions within this area should focus on developing continental scale fine scale climate simulations by applying an ensemble of such climate models the climate change signals obtained in this study and applied in a statistical downscaling framework may be tested and compared with a dynamic downscaling approach large ensembles of cpms are however not available yet the simulations performed in this study for the development of idf curves are computationally expensive because of the size of the study domain and the use of the de mc method for sampling the gpd parameters this is indeed the first large scale study which considers uncertainty in distribution parameter estimation a large number of realizations in our case 5000 iterations including 2000 burn in iterations were sampled using the de mc method from the gpd parameters posterior distributions at each model grid over europe the development of idf curves at a catchment scale would substantially decrease the simulation time for reasons of comparison the distribution parameters were also estimated using the classical maximum likelihood method the point estimation of distribution parameters by these classical methods is much less computationally demanding but this is at the expense of disregarding the uncertainties in the estimation of the parameters the idf curves were developed in this study by assuming that precipitation is primarily in the form of rainfall whose extreme events are more intense than snowmelt events this assumption may not however be valid in snow dominated regions where an extreme precipitation event can be mainly snowfall which is not immediately available for rainfall runoff processes or where snowmelt or rain on snow rates exceed extreme rainfall the rainfall based idf curves in these regions may lead to design storm overestimation and infrastructure overdesign in the former case and design storm underestimation and infrastructure underdesign in the latter yan et al 2018 future research may address snow processes in the development of idf curves in the snow dominated regions in europe 5 conclusions this study investigated the impact of climate change on short duration extreme precipitation over europe using the euro cordex rcms for medium and far future periods the idf curves were accordingly revised considering storm durations ranging between 30 min and 24 h and return periods ranging between 1 and 100 years the results reveal that under climate change future idf curves will be uplifted and steepened with a larger degree under rcp8 5 compared to rcp4 5 the continental median of the uplift is between 16 and 27 depending on the duration and return period whereas the steepening is between 17 and 25 depending on the return period the upward shift in idf curves is caused by the intensification of extreme precipitation under climate change a larger increase of shorter duration extreme precipitation under climate change leads to steeper future idf curves and the expected steepening is larger for higher return periods the longer the return period and the shorter the duration of rainstorm is the larger the change will be the dependency of the changes on the return period is more pronounced compared to the duration in addition to the intensity of extreme precipitation the frequency of sub daily extreme precipitation is projected to increase the frequency of 50 year and 100 year extreme precipitation events will be doubled under rcp4 5 and tripled under rcp8 5 the expected changes in precipitation characteristics namely intensity duration and frequency idf curves must be incorporated for the future design of urban water systems as well as in adaptation planning the future projections of extreme precipitation and idf curves are however subject to uncertainty which also needs to be taken into consideration the uncertainty is larger for more extreme precipitation and with lesser extent dependent on duration being larger for shorter

5151,to build future climate proof water systems and to reduce the failure risk of infrastructure short duration extreme precipitation design storms must be updated however a robust future projection of such storms on a continental scale has not been presented due to the scarcity of long high quality sub daily data both for observations and model simulations to address this need we develop current and future precipitation intensity duration frequency idf curves for europe for 0 5 1 3 6 12 and 24 hour durations and for different return periods ranging between 1 and 100 years derived from a generalized pareto distribution gpd future idf curves are developed in the framework of the quantile perturbation downscaling method by applying climate change signals from the euro cordex rcms on current idf curves obtained from high resolution remote sensing based products here we show that rarer sub daily extreme precipitation events will intensify more than less rare events and that changes may depend on precipitation duration the frequency of sub daily extreme precipitation events of 50 and 100 year return periods will be tripled under the high end rcp8 5 scenario such intensification will lead to a substantial uplift 16 27 depending on duration and return period and steepening 17 25 depending on return period of the idf curves under future climate change calling attention to the vulnerability of the existing water infrastructure systems keywords idf curves sub daily precipitation gpd parameters regional climate model uncertainty 1 introduction flash floods caused by short intense rainstorms are amongst earth s most common costliest and destructive weather related hazards leading to loss of life or property and destruction of infrastructure gaume et al 2009 papagiannaki et al 2015 willner et al 2018 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020 they are more likely to happen in urban areas with fast runoff processes and short response times because of a greater prevalence of impermeable surfaces mishra et al 2012 they in turn lead to cross sectoral cascading infrastructure system failures because of extensive interdependencies in urban areas threatening human health and local economies wilbanks and fernandez 2014 penny et al 2018 the design of flood control structures and urban water infrastructure is typically based on the statistical properties of extreme precipitation in the form of intensity duration frequency idf curves which quantify the frequency of occurrence of a given precipitation intensity over a range of time scales or temporal durations hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 2018 yan et al 2018 boukhelifa et al 2018 the idf curves also have important implications for other infrastructure vulnerable to heavy precipitation such as land based transportation systems e g streets and railways kermanshah et al 2017 electricity and telecommunication networks and those related to river floods and landslides nissen and ulbrich 2017 the idf relationships and design criteria are usually developed for a single and specific location based on historical precipitation data raingauge data provide the most accurate liquid precipitation rain estimates and thereby the most accurate design criteria in rainfall dominated areas and seasons nevertheless raingauge measurements are affected by systematic errors such as underestimations due to wind induced undercatch which is much larger when precipitation turns into snow grossi et al 2017 and to heating related losses in tipping bucket gauges for snowfall measurements savina et al 2012 the availability of long high quality gauge records is also restricted in some regions lumbroso et al 2011 vu et al 2018 libertino et al 2019 further the spatial pattern of precipitation cannot be captured using a sparse gauging network courty et al 2019 the scarcity of long term precipitation records of high temporal resolution is another restriction for engineering practice and infrastructure design e g for flash flood events which are of a short duration of several minutes to a few hours berne et al 2004 in fact daily precipitation cannot capture the life cycle of single storms and masks the effect of more intense precipitation at sub daily time scales singleton and toumi 2013 thanks to high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing based precipitation products we are now able to estimate the design storms in ungauged regions and to capture intergauge gradients and to analyze the large scale regional continental and global spatial structure of extreme precipitation to explore different orographic and climatic drivers of such events sun et al 2018 nguyen et al 2019 marra et al 2019 caution should however be exercised when comparing raingauge and gridded data based idf curves because of the scale mismatch between point gauge observations and grid average estimates maraun 2013 tabari et al 2016 recent generations of remotely sensed datasets have been developed by merging satellite estimates with gauge and reanalysis data to provide global precipitation estimates that have uniform reliability both spatially and temporally beck et al 2017 2019 accordingly satellite based precipitation has more recently been utilized in a handful number of studies to develop idf curves but with a focus on current climate conditions small regions and or daily precipitation gado et al 2017 marra et al 2017 ombadi et al 2018 courty et al 2019 the lack of sub daily precipitation is also an issue for future assessments of extreme precipitation as climate model data are very limited at sub daily scales olsson et al 2015 hence future changes in sub daily extreme precipitation especially on larger spatial scales are less quantified this is particularly important as the changes in sub daily extreme precipitation under anthropogenic forcing can be greater than those in daily extremes hanel and buishand 2010 molnar et al 2015 tabari et al 2016 miao et al 2016 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2019 the expected and already experienced increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation under climate change janssen et al 2014 wang et al 2017 tabari and willems 2018 zobel et al 2018 as the most notable change among hydrological variables hegerl et al 2015 calls for updating the current idf curves under the different climate scenarios to plan and build more resilient climate proof systems wang et al 2014 sandink et al 2016 so et al 2017 they more specifically can be applied to quantify flood and overflow frequencies of urban drainage systems and storage facilities and to design adaptation strategies although the urgency of integrating climate change impacts into infrastructure design through updating idf curves has been recognized by local authorities and decision makers simonovic et al 2017 practical development of the future idf curves is complicated because of the aforementioned limitations in view of these limitations in this study 30 min 8 km precipitation outputs from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center morphing cmorph technique xie et al 2017 and 3 hourly 12 km precipitation outputs from the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep are used in conjunction with 3 hourly 12 km precipitation simulations from the coordinated downscaling experiment over europe euro cordex jacob et al 2014 climate models to estimate current and future climate idf curves for europe precipitation intensities for different return periods ranging between 1 and 100 years are calculated by fitting a generalized pareto distribution gpd to the partial duration series for different storm durations ranging between 0 5 and 24 h a bayesian inference based differential evolution markov chain de mc approach is used for estimation of the gpd distribution parameters and associated uncertainties the future idf curves are derived by applying climate change signals on the current climate idf curves in the framework of the quantile perturbation downscaling method 2 materials and methods the overall methodological framework adopted in this study contains three main parts data preprocessing extreme value analysis and idf curve development fig 1 2 1 data 2 1 1 observation datasets two high resolution datasets are used to develop current climate idf curves and base the presentation of future curves after applying climate change impacts the selected datasets are cmorph and mswep these datasets were selected based on their spatial resolution temporal scale quality bias corrected and length the cmorph precipitation products with the finest temporal and spatial resolutions amongst satellite datasets wang et al 2019 have been shown by numerous studies to have a comparable precision with ground based observations zeweldi and gebremichael 2009 the cmorph dataset has been derived from propagated low orbiter passive satellite microwave pmw observations by motion vectors resulting from geostationary satellite infrared imagery joyce et al 2004 it covers the global domain from 60 s to 60 n quasi global coverage with precipitation data in a half hourly interval over grid sizes of 0 073 0 073 or 8 km at the equator from 1 january 1998 onwards the new version of cmorph produces cmorphv1 0 2015 for the period 1998 2017 which is bias corrected against ncep cpc daily precipitation at nearly 30 000 raingauges around the world xie et al 2017 is used in this study this new version provides more accurate precipitation estimates and reduced spurious trends and biases in comparison to the original version gehne et al 2016 mswep dataset also has a high accuracy with their best overall performance among 26 precipitation datasets evaluated against gauge data beck et al 2019 it is a fully global precipitation dataset obtained from merging precipitation data from different sources of gauge satellite and reanalysis beck et al 2017 we use version 2 1 of this dataset with a 3 hourly temporal resolution and 0 1 12 km spatial resolution for the period 1979 2016 in addition to the cmorph and mswep datasets daily precipitation data from the e obs v20 0e dataset with 0 1 12 km spatial resolution for the period from 1950 01 01 to 2019 07 31 are used to quantify the bias in estimation of high quantiles with short records the unique high quality 10 min precipitation data recorded with the same instrument for the period 1901 2000 at uccle near brussels and hourly precipitation data for the period 1951 2020 at de bilt de kooy eelde flushing and volkel stations in the netherlands are used to scrutinize the bias in the estimation of the high quantiles with short records to evaluate the performance of the quantile perturbation downscaling method and to assess the calibration of the extreme value distributions 2 1 2 climate model simulations for developing future idf curves climate change signals are calculated using the euro cordex regional climate models rcms simulations climate simulations of the euro cordex rcms have been produced by a dynamically downscaling of the global climate model gcm simulations from the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 the downscaled euro cordex climate simulations have spatial resolutions of 0 44 50 km and 0 11 12 5 km and temporal resolutions of daily and 3 hourly it is expected that the higher resolution of the rcms improves the representation of meso scale processes associated with the formation of extreme precipitation as well as orographic features tabari and willems 2018 as higher resolution precipitation is more relevant for hydrological impact studies of climate change we use the finest resolutions of the euro cordex rcms 3 hourly temporal resolution and 0 11 spatial resolution these high resolution simulations for the euro cordex domain are only available for the rca4 rcm developed at the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi strandberg et al 2014 the rcms simulations are driven by mpi esm lr cnrm cm5 hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a mr and ec earth gcms from the cmip5 project the period 1971 2000 is considered as the reference period and climate change signals are evaluated for medium 2041 2070 and far 2071 2100 future periods with respect to the reference period under two representative concentration pathways rcps moss et al 2010 of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 rcp8 5 corresponds to a pathway with the highest emission level in which radiative forcing reaches 8 5 w m2 at the end of the century riahi et al 2011 while rcp4 5 is a stabilization scenario that stabilizes radiative forcing at 4 5 w m2 thomson et al 2011 2 2 extreme value analysis two main sampling methods for extreme value analysis are annual maxima and peak over threshold pot also called partial duration series the pot method provides a larger extreme precipitation data sample for a more accurate estimation of distribution parameters yilmaz et al 2017 marra et al 2019 the pot analysis also allows for a more rational selection of extreme events instead of considering only one event per year in the annual maxima method lang et al 1999 as the second or even higher order extremes in some years can be larger than the annual extremes in other years pasarić and cindrić 2019 the threshold method also works quite well when the tails of distributions are asymmetric mcneil and frey 2000 despite the aforementioned advantages of the pot method most of the previous studies have applied the annual maxima method pombo and de oliveira 2015 ombadi et al 2018 faridzad et al 2018 the results are hereafter shown using the pot framework however to characterize the extreme value distribution uncertainty precipitation extremes are also analyzed using the annual maxima method based on the gev for the pot selection the extreme value threshold and inter event time are the main criteria willems 2009 the threshold for extreme precipitation values is chosen high enough equal to the 98th percentile of all days to include only extreme values more relevant for pluvial flooding and to ensure reliable tail asymptotics underlying the distribution approximation and whereby reducing the related bias scarrott and macdonald 2012 the percentile of all daily precipitation values rather than wet days is chosen to avoid the effects of varying number of wet days in europe on the percentile level fischer knutti 2015 higher thresholds reduce the sample size of extremes thus increasing the variance of the parameter estimates scarrott and macdonald 2012 the inter event time defines dependency of subsequent extreme events i e serial correlation in the time series which results from the duration of mesoscale rainstorm events willems et al 2007 to ensure that the extremes are taken from independent events the maximum sub daily precipitation per day is considered to find the best distribution to pot series we fit 16 distributions birnbaum saunders exponential extreme value gamma generalized extreme value generalized pareto inverse gaussian logistic log logistic log normal nakagami normal rayleigh rician t location scale and weibull to over three million pot series examined in this study the distribution with the lowest bayesian information criterion bic is chosen as the best fitted distribution the results indicate that the pot series in all the datasets cmorph mswep and euro cordex can be approximated most accurately with a generalized pareto distribution gpd fig 2 a this is in agreement with previous studies katz et al 2002 renard et al 2006 lazoglou et al 2019 the percentage of the pot series with gpd as the best fitting distribution ranges between 94 7 for the rcm simulations under rcp8 5 to 99 9 for the historical rcm simulations fig 2b shows that the spatial distribution of the bic of the best fitted model has a south north bipolar pattern based on these results we use the gpd for the pot series the standard cumulative distribution function of the gpd is defined by 1 f ζ μ σ x 1 1 ζ x μ σ 1 ζ for ζ 0 1 exp x μ σ for ζ 0 the gpd distribution is characterized by three parameters including location µ scale σ and shape ζ of the distribution describing the center of distribution the deviation around the mean and the tail behavior of the distribution respectively embrechts et al 1997 according to the shape parameter three extreme distributions are defined as pareto exponential and beta corresponding to ζ 0 ζ 0 and ζ 0 respectively the return level xp i e the value that is expected to be exceeded once every t years on average associated with the return period 1 p for the chosen threshold u is given by 2 x p u σ ζ 1 p ζ u 1 for ζ 0 u σ log 1 p ζ u for ζ 0 the parameters of the selected distribution are estimated classically by various parametric e g probability weighted moment maximum likelihood and two step and three step estimators and semi parametric e g moment hill and pickands estimators methods aghakouchak and nasrollahi 2010 however these classical methods do not take into account the uncertainty associated with the point estimate of parameters rupa et al 2015 bayesian method has the capability to reasonably address the uncertainties in the estimation of parameters mélèse et al 2018 another advantage of the bayesian method is its feasibility in non regular likelihood cases e g short tail of the parent population from which the data is drawn rupa et al 2015 let us consider x x1 x2 xn as the set of n pot values extracted from the precipitation time series and θ as the parameter of a given distribution following the bayes theorem the posterior distributions are estimated based on knowledge of the prior distribution and the observation vector as renard et al 2006 3 p θ x i 1 n p θ p x i θ in our case θ is a vector containing the gpd distribution parameters 4 p μ σ ζ x i 1 n p μ p σ p ζ p x i μ σ ζ the priors prior knowledge of analysts about parameters are non informative normal distributions for the location and scale parameters and a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0 3 for the shape parameter as suggested in renard et al 2006 and cheng et al 2014 the differential evolution markov chain de mc with a metropolis hastings sampler haario et al 1999 2001 is then applied to sample a large number of realizations in our case 5000 iterations including 2000 burn in iterations from the gpd parameters posterior distributions in fact the de is used for a global optimization over the parameter space with the markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach by proposing candidate values for the posterior distribution ter braak 2006 vrugt et al 2009 the de mc with a higher convergence speed is faster than the conventional mcmc ter braak 2006 to assess convergence of the sampling approach we use the r criterion gelman and shirley 2011 with the upper limit of 1 1 cheng et al 2014 ragno et al 2018 merging bayesian inference with de mc allows the derivation of the confidence interval and uncertainty bounds of estimated extreme precipitation intensities for idf curves based on the sampled parameters to assess the influence of the distribution parameter estimation method the parameters are also estimated using the maximum likelihood method 2 3 development of idf curves we analyze sub daily precipitation data for a whole year from the observations and the control and scenario simulations of the rcms to obtain the pot time series for individual native grid cells of each dataset in the european domain we then aggregate 0 5 hr precipitation for each grid cell into accumulations of non overlapping 1 3 6 12 and 24 hr periods and the gpd is fitted to the pot precipitation values for the selected storm durations the duration of precipitation events for the mswep dataset and the rcms simulations is constrained to the range of 3 24 h as their finest time resolution is 3 hourly different precipitation intensities are estimated for different return periods t from 1 to 100 years while the results for the selected t of 2 10 50 and 100 years and the respected durations for each dataset are used for plotting the idf curves in addition to the bic statistical measure the goodness of fit of the gpd model is visually assessed by comparing the probability distribution function of the observed and theoretical gpd based pot values we consider gpd simulations reliable when the envelope 90 confidence interval of the de mc simulations encompasses all of the empirical return levels with a closer median of the simulated ensemble to the empirical values as a better goodness of fit once the gpd is fitted to the observed and modeled extreme precipitation future idf curves are developed using the quantile perturbation downscaling method willems 2013 numerous hydrological impact studies of climate change have found this method superior to simpler methods that correct the bias only in mean or mean and variance of precipitation series gudmundsson et al 2012 teutschbein and seibert 2012 chen et al 2013 applying the corrections per quantile in our case return periods ranging between 1 and 100 years maintains distinct bias of climate models for different quantiles the quantile perturbation method necessitates regridding the observations and rcm grid sizes to a common rectangular grid the regridding is performed by a bilinear interpolation method afterwards quantile specific bias correction factors are calculated for each duration and individual grid cell over europe by assuming that the systematic bias of climate models to be corrected is temporally stationary the bias correction factors derived from historical simulations for each grid cell are applied on future simulations of the same cell cannon et al 2015 the assumption ensures that the changes in quantiles are unaffected by the bias correction this process is performed for each climate model run and rcp separately thus preserving the sensitivity of the models to external forcings and allowing a climate model uncertainty quantification the bias corrected quantiles in the future simulations are used to develop future idf curves due to the unavailability of 0 5 and 1 hr precipitation results in the euro cordex simulations 3 hourly rcm simulations are bias corrected based on 0 5 and 1 hr cmorph quantiles to derive future quantiles for the respected durations in this way the bias correction factors involve both the systematic bias of the climate model results and the temporal disaggregation ratio the latter can also be seen as temporal statistical downscaling the temporal disaggregation ratio for 30 min hourly duration is obtained at each model grid over europe by comparing 3 hourly and 30 min hourly precipitation quantiles from gridded observations for the same return period to validate the downscaling results the 3 hourly historical euro cordex simulations for the period 1971 2000 are downscaled based on hourly observations at some stations with long term records for the same period using the quantile perturbation method afterwards the bias correction factors are applied on the rcp8 5 simulations for the same quantiles and at respected station s location for the period 2006 2019 in the investigation of the future changes in the form of idf curves the changes in the intensity of extreme precipitation are translated into the changes in the ordinate of the curves either upward or downward shift for the changes in the slope of idf curves the ratios of the slope of extreme precipitation with durations between the current and future climates for individual grid cells are calculated for different return periods between 1 and 100 years we also assess the uncertainty in projected extreme precipitation changes for different durations and return periods the changes in extreme precipitation are computed as the ratio of the values for the future period 2041 2070 or 2071 2100 over those for the historical period 1971 2000 the total uncertainty includes the uncertainties associated with the choice of climate models five euro cordex rcm members emission scenarios rcp4 5 rcp8 5 extreme value distributions gpd gev and distribution parameter estimation methods de mc maximum likelihood to quantify the uncertainty propagated due to emission scenarios hereafter scenario uncertainty we estimate the variability across rcps here characterized by the standard deviation after taking the median of the changes derived from different climate model runs extreme value distributions and distribution parameter estimation methods a similar procedure is adopted to quantify the uncertainties related to climate model runs hereafter model uncertainty extreme value distributions hereafter distribution uncertainty and distribution parameter estimation methods hereafter parameter uncertainty the fractional uncertainty is finally calculated as a ratio of the uncertainty of each source to the total uncertainty which is the sum of the variations due to all the four uncertainty sources 2 4 high quantile estimation bias from short records the larger the extrapolation beyond the record length the less reliable is the return level a common rule of thumb in conventional at site quantile estimates is to restrict extrapolation to return periods of up to twice the record length kidson and richards 2005 however for making an estimate of a 100 year event we extrapolate quantiles larger than twice as long as the record length in order to quantify the related bias in estimation of high quantiles from short records i e extrapolated quantiles using the gpd the estimated quantiles from short and long records are compared for individual grid cells to this end an extrapolation ratio is first defined as the ratio of return periods t to the record length l because the cmorph dataset has the shortest record among the considered datasets in our study a 20 year length is used as the denominator of the extrapolation ratio for all datasets the bias in high quantiles is then calculated by dividing the quantiles estimated from the full time series for specific return periods over those from a 20 year sub series for the same return periods for each dataset the upper limit of return periods is equal to the length of the full time series to avoid extrapolation bias in the long record which is used as the benchmark for example for the e obs data the quantiles estimated from the full e obs data with a 70 year length 1950 2019 for the return periods between 20 and 70 years are divided over those from a sub series of the e obs data with a 20 year length 2000 2019 for the same return periods afterwards the bias is plotted against the extrapolation ratios which range between 1 and 3 5 for the e obs dataset t l when l 20 and t 20 21 22 70 see fig 9a similar analyses are performed using 3 hourly mswep and 30 min uccle raingauge data in the former the bias is obtained by comparing the quantiles between 38 1979 2016 and 20 1997 2016 year data and in the latter between 100 1901 2000 and 20 1981 2000 year data the extrapolation ratios range between 1 and 1 9 for mswep dataset l 20 and t 20 21 22 38 and between 1 and 5 for uccle raingauge data l 20 and t 20 21 22 100 we also analyze the bias in terms of the shape parameter of the gpd by comparing the parameter value between short and long records 3 results 3 1 changes in the probability distribution of short duration extreme precipitation the gpd is fitted separately to extreme precipitation at each grid cell of each dataset and for each storm duration considered the distribution parameters for different storm durations derived from cmorph and mswep datasets are shown in fig 3 the location parameters representing the mean of the distribution from cmorph are larger than the ones from mswep and the difference gets smaller with increasing rainstorm durations fig 3a a larger location parameter from cmorph means higher extreme value estimates from this dataset spatially the location parameter has larger variations over europe for longer duration intensities that are more pronounced in mswep table s1 this is because the spatial patterns in the longer duration intensities become more visible due to the lower uncertainties less random scatter spatially compared to the shorter duration intensities the climate change impact assessment using the high resolution euro cordex rcm ensemble indicates that the location parameter will increase all over europe 97 of the area figs s1 and s2 by a continental average change of 10 and 17 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the projected changes go up to 32 and 48 in some areas for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively furthermore the changes in the location parameter are roughly independent of the duration fig 3b in contrast to the location parameter the scale parameter representing the dispersion of the distribution is smaller in cmorph compared to mswep fig 3c with the spatial median values ranging between 0 12 and 0 09 for 3 hr to 24 hr durations for the former and around 0 14 for the latter the scale parameter decreases with storm duration in both datasets particularly in cmorph from 0 17 to 0 09 fig 3c similarly its spatial variation also decreases with duration table s1 the spatial variation patterns of the location and scale parameters over europe show some similarities figs s1 and s2 pointing to a larger variability for higher extreme values over europe the scale parameter is expected to increase under climate change in 98 of the european area at a higher rate compared to the location parameter figs s1 and s2 accounting for continental averaged increases of 11 and 17 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the signals of relative increase in the scale parameter reach 57 and 79 in some locations for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the projected increase in the scale parameter means that climate change will widen the distribution of extreme precipitation indicating an amplified variability of extreme precipitation in the warmer world an increase in mean daily precipitation variability has been shown before for a majority of global land area in response to warming pendergrass et al 2017 kharin et al 2018 he and li 2019 the larger spread of the distribution is caused by the larger magnitudes of change in extreme precipitation for higher intensities return periods see our results in the next section the future changes in the scale parameter slightly decrease with increasing storm duration accounting for 13 9 and 5 3 differences in the spatial 90th and 50th percentiles of changes between 3 hourly and daily intensities for rcp8 5 rcp4 5 fig 3d the median shape parameter over europe for all storm durations and for both datasets is positive with values ranging between 0 06 and 0 13 for different durations suggesting a heavy tailed distribution for extreme precipitation over europe fig 3e the positive shape parameter is observed over 94 of the european area for 0 5 hr extreme precipitation and is within the range of 78 92 for multi hourly extreme precipitation figs s1 and s2 similar to the location parameter but with a much lesser extent the shape parameter in both datasets decreases when moving from short to long durations fig 3e implying that the tail of the distribution becomes less heavy for longer duration intensities a positive shape parameter has also been previously reported for daily gauge extreme precipitation based on the generalized extreme value gev distribution koutsoyiannis 2004 ragulina and reitan 2017 with a global average of 0 093 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 the median shape parameters from our continental analysis for cmorph are 0 13 0 11 0 09 0 08 0 07 and 0 06 for 0 5 1 3 6 12 24 hr storm durations respectively the mswep shape parameters tend to be larger for the corresponding durations fig 3e comparing the spatial variation of the shape parameter between the two datasets shows higher values for cmorph figs s1 and s2 the spatial variation of the shape parameter is the highest among the gpd parameters for all durations and both datasets table s1 projections from the euro cordex rcm ensemble show an increase in the shape parameter but not as widespread as that in the location and scale parameters fig 3f the increase is indeed projected for 61 63 of the continental area figs s1 and s2 making the tail of the distribution heavier for short duration extreme precipitation in the future similar to the location parameter the changes in the shape parameter are shown to be independent of the storm duration fig 3f 3 2 changes in the intensity and frequency of short duration extreme precipitation the climate change projections show that 3 hr extreme precipitation will increase for all return periods under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 fig 4 a b the longer the return period and the shorter the duration the larger is the change fig 4a b the dependency of the changes on the return period is more pronounced compared to the duration in agreement with previous studies kharin et al 2018 cannon and innocenti 2019 the results suggest that rarer extreme precipitation events will intensify more than less rare events and that changes may depend on event duration a greater intensification of rarer extremes is attributed to the increase in the dispersion of the gpd distribution shown in fig 3d the median of the expected changes over europe for rcp8 5 rcp4 5 ranges between 20 12 and 27 20 depending on the return period in some areas the intensity of 100 year short duration precipitation will be about doubled at the end of the 21st century with increases of 95 and 122 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig s3 s14 the expected return periods under future climatic conditions of 3 and 24 hr extreme precipitation events historically associated with return periods of 50 and 100 years are shown in fig 4c d the frequency of such events medianed over the continent will be doubled in the future under rcp4 5 and tripled under rcp8 5 in fact 3 hr daily extreme events expected to occur every 50 years would occur every 25 27 and 18 19 years for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively similarly 3 hr daily 100 year precipitation would occur more frequently every 50 53 and 33 35 years in the future under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively our overall conclusion is that short duration extreme precipitation will be intensified at a greater rate compared to long duration storms thus supporting the results of the previous studies regarding a super clausius clapeyron scaling of sub daily extreme precipitation with warming e g mishra et al 2012 the spatial distribution of the changes shows that the 3 hourly extreme precipitation increases over almost the entire domain while the increase is generally larger for the eastern half longitudes 5 fig s3 s14 the changes in daily extreme precipitation follow a similar spatial pattern but with a smaller magnitude which turns into a decreasing signal for 2 year extremes over the southern part of europe the extreme precipitation changes for the medium future period 2041 2070 are also increasing for all return periods and durations fig 5 as expected the amount of changes is smaller for the medium future period compared to the far future 2071 2100 period however the spatial distribution of the changes is similar fig s15 16 the change difference between the two future horizons is larger for rcp8 5 in comparison to rcp4 5 fig 5 for rcp4 5 the changes for the far future period are about 37 65 larger than those for the medium future period depending on duration and return period while it increases to 54 74 for rcp8 5 the model uncertainty also increases with lead time being larger for the far future period fig 5 the sensitivity of the climate change signals to the method for extreme value analysis annual maxima vs pot and the related extreme value distribution selected gev vs gpd is also investigated see the signals computed based on the gev in fig s17 s19 the results show a good consistency between the extreme precipitation changes derived from gev and gpd although the changes by gev are slightly larger for rcp8 5 fig s17 3 3 towards building future climate proof infrastructure to reduce the failure risk of infrastructure and design a reliable and durable construction they should be resilient to future climate change to build such a future climate proof infrastructure the design storms estimated from the idf curves should be revised to adapt the infrastructure to a changing climate through implementing adaptation actions as the failure of different types of infrastructure occurs at different precipitation thresholds and even for each type there is no universal critical value over europe nissen and ulbrich 2017 the expected changes in common return periods for infrastructure design i e rainstorms of 2 10 50 and 100 year return periods are analyzed future extreme precipitation values are obtained by applying climate change signals on historical extreme precipitation in the framework of the quantile perturbation downscaling method our results indicate that the quantile perturbation method performs well in correcting the bias in future quantiles from model simulations fig s20 the future short duration precipitation maps for different return periods are presented in figs 6 and s21 from which the failure risk of different infrastructure types with different thresholds for all areas within europe can be obtained e g between 10 and 20 year return periods for urban drainage systems willems et al 2012 or 10 year return period for the international union for railways uic 2008 for example the spatial 95th and 50th percentiles of 0 5 hr 100 year precipitation depth over the continent under present day climate conditions are 99 and 66 mm hr that will increase to 127 and 82 mm hr by the end of the century for the high end rcp8 5 scenario fig 6 the expected increase in the frequency and intensity of short duration precipitation compromises the resilience of infrastructure designed and constructed based on the current climate idf curves fig 7 illustrates the current and future downscaled idf curves for 2 and 100 year storms for some european locations under rcp8 5 along with distribution parameter and climate change uncertainties the best fitting distribution in all locations is the gpd whose probability distribution function has a good match with that of the empirical distribution figs s22 s24 the future idf curves in the six selected locations are developed by applying climate change signals on the current idf curves fig 7 a comparison between the current and future idf curves reveals an upward shift and a steepening of the curves in the future in all the locations our plots also show that the parameter estimation uncertainty is larger for longer return periods e g because of larger sampling errors cheng et al 2015 and even in some cases the lower bound of the future climate intensity falls within the observation confidence interval bounds related to the uncertainty of the gpd parameter estimation by the de mc approach the overall uplift and steepening are also found for idf relationships at the continental scale which are larger for rcp8 5 compared to rcp4 5 fig 8 the magnitudes of the changes in the ordinate and slope of idf curves are comparable with larger ordinate changes in 3 and 6 hourly extreme precipitation and smaller ordinate changes for 12 and 24 hourly extremes the uplift is due to the intensification of extreme precipitation under climate change fig 4a b the steepening of idf curves is attributed to the larger increase of shorter duration extremes fig 4a b the steepening of idf curves grows with return periods from 17 10 for 1 year extreme precipitation to 25 16 for 100 year events under rcp8 5 rcp4 5 the upward shift in idf curves ranges between 16 9 and 27 18 under rcp8 5 rcp4 5 increasing gradually with return period and decreasing with duration fig 8 in order to quantify the uncertainty of the quantile estimates from short records we compare high quantiles between the full time series of the e obs 70 year data and mswep 38 year data over the entire european domain as well as uccle raingauge 100 year data with those from a sub sample with a 20 year length equal to the length of the cmorph time series as the shortest series examined fig 9 the results show that short records in all datasets underestimate extreme precipitation and the amount of the underestimation increases with the extrapolation ratio fig 9a the bias increment with the extrapolation ratio is more evident for the century long 0 5 hr raingauge data for the mswep data the bias in high quantile estimations by short records is slightly larger for a shorter duration the underestimation of daily quantiles by short records is less than 6 while it may go up to 30 for sub daily quantiles our results are in contrast to the findings of marra et al 2017 for a small study area in the eastern mediterranean they found an overestimation of the idf values with short records which decreases with the time aggregation of precipitation our results also reveal that the underestimation of extreme precipitation quantiles from short records mainly stems from the underestimation of the gpd shape parameter fig 9 b care should however be taken in generalizing the underestimation of the gpd shape parameter by short records to other regions and time periods from a multi decadal climate oscillation perspective the location of the 20 year period in an oscillation high or an oscillation low period may change the results quantifying the climate change uncertainty over the entire europe reveal a clear dependency of the total uncertainty on the return period the longer the return period the larger the uncertainty not shown a larger uncertainty in the projected changes of more extreme precipitation has also been reported in a recent study by tabari et al 2019 the increase of uncertainty with the extreme precipitation rarity is found for all four uncertainty components the total uncertainty as well as the uncertainty of individual components also depends on the duration the shorter the duration the larger the uncertainty the dependency of the uncertainty to duration is more pronounced in the model and scenario uncertainties than in the distribution and parameter uncertainties the total uncertainty in projected extreme precipitation changes decomposed into its main sources is shown in fig 10 due to different gradients of the absolute uncertainties of the components with return period the relative contribution of model and scenario uncertainties is decreasing with return period while that of distribution and parameter uncertainties is increasing with return period models and scenarios with comparable uncertainty magnitudes ranging between 36 and 46 provide the largest uncertainties parameter and distribution uncertainties have the lowest contributions to the total uncertainty in extreme precipitation changes respectively the parameter and distribution contributions are within the range of 8 15 and 5 12 respectively 4 discussion unlike previous studies which have focused on relatively small domains current climate conditions and daily precipitation e g marra et al 2017 ombadi et al 2018 courty et al 2019 this study provides future idf curves at a continental scale based on high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing based precipitation products cmorph and mswep and sub daily precipitation simulations from the euro cordex rcms the climate change impact analysis on extreme precipitation revealed an intensification of extreme precipitation with a larger intensification of rarer extreme events compared to less rare events this is in agreement with earlier studies kharin et al 2018 cannon and innocenti 2019 the intensification is to a lesser extent larger for shorter duration events the results also pointed to a threefold increase in the frequency of occurrence of sub daily extreme precipitation intensities for 50 and 100 year return periods under the high end rcp8 5 scenario relative to past events a comparison between the historical and future idf curves implies a large uplift and steepening of these curves under climate change the upward shift and steepening of future idf curves were also observed over north america cannon and innocenti 2019 the expected changes in idf curves call into question the resilience of the existing infrastructure systems under more frequent and intense rainstorms in the future this is of particular importance in urban areas where the failure risk can be cascaded owing to extensive interconnections between different infrastructure systems hence in order to create resilient societies the breakdown risk of infrastructure systems designed based on historical rainstorms and dependent subsystems in urban areas must be reduced by proper adaptation strategies to avoid lock in inflexible strategies and decrease the risk of decision failure regarding the evolving nature of risks over time capacity building win win or low regret synergy options or iterative adaptation pathways must be undertaken this study also investigated the uncertainty in future projections of extreme precipitation and idf curves across different durations and return periods which has not been quantified at such scales in previous studies the results showed that the future projections of idf curves are subject to a large uncertainty the uncertainty increases with rainstorm extremity and decreases with duration the large uncertainty in the future projections calls for a flexible and iterative adaptation approach based on a framework for decision making under uncertainty adaptation pathways and so called adaptive management this kind of adaptations can be iteratively updated by taking the advantages of new information and feedbacks and the lessons learned from the success and failure of actions the uncertainties in projected extreme precipitation changes associated with climate models emission scenarios extreme value distributions and parameter estimation methods were quantified in this study model and scenario uncertainties were found to be the dominant sources there also exist other uncertainty sources such as the downscaling and bias correction method uncertainty whose quantification needs further investigation two commonly used distributions for extreme value analysis and development of idf curves i e gpd and gev were used here however other types of distributions such as pearson iii have also been used to derive idf curves in some studies the inclusion of such distributions in future work can improve the uncertainty analysis of extreme value distributions this study made use of 3 hourly precipitation simulations from 12 km rcms for the climate change impact assessment nevertheless summer sub hourly precipitation extremes are usually produced by convective storms that cannot be well modelled by rcms because of their coarse spatial and temporal resolutions the convection permitting climate models cpms models with a spatial resolution 4 km are therefore required to more realistically represent local and short duration storm dynamics and reliably project future changes relevant for urban hydrology over europe the fine scale simulations from such models are however still rare and limited to few modeling centers due to their high computational expenses future research directions within this area should focus on developing continental scale fine scale climate simulations by applying an ensemble of such climate models the climate change signals obtained in this study and applied in a statistical downscaling framework may be tested and compared with a dynamic downscaling approach large ensembles of cpms are however not available yet the simulations performed in this study for the development of idf curves are computationally expensive because of the size of the study domain and the use of the de mc method for sampling the gpd parameters this is indeed the first large scale study which considers uncertainty in distribution parameter estimation a large number of realizations in our case 5000 iterations including 2000 burn in iterations were sampled using the de mc method from the gpd parameters posterior distributions at each model grid over europe the development of idf curves at a catchment scale would substantially decrease the simulation time for reasons of comparison the distribution parameters were also estimated using the classical maximum likelihood method the point estimation of distribution parameters by these classical methods is much less computationally demanding but this is at the expense of disregarding the uncertainties in the estimation of the parameters the idf curves were developed in this study by assuming that precipitation is primarily in the form of rainfall whose extreme events are more intense than snowmelt events this assumption may not however be valid in snow dominated regions where an extreme precipitation event can be mainly snowfall which is not immediately available for rainfall runoff processes or where snowmelt or rain on snow rates exceed extreme rainfall the rainfall based idf curves in these regions may lead to design storm overestimation and infrastructure overdesign in the former case and design storm underestimation and infrastructure underdesign in the latter yan et al 2018 future research may address snow processes in the development of idf curves in the snow dominated regions in europe 5 conclusions this study investigated the impact of climate change on short duration extreme precipitation over europe using the euro cordex rcms for medium and far future periods the idf curves were accordingly revised considering storm durations ranging between 30 min and 24 h and return periods ranging between 1 and 100 years the results reveal that under climate change future idf curves will be uplifted and steepened with a larger degree under rcp8 5 compared to rcp4 5 the continental median of the uplift is between 16 and 27 depending on the duration and return period whereas the steepening is between 17 and 25 depending on the return period the upward shift in idf curves is caused by the intensification of extreme precipitation under climate change a larger increase of shorter duration extreme precipitation under climate change leads to steeper future idf curves and the expected steepening is larger for higher return periods the longer the return period and the shorter the duration of rainstorm is the larger the change will be the dependency of the changes on the return period is more pronounced compared to the duration in addition to the intensity of extreme precipitation the frequency of sub daily extreme precipitation is projected to increase the frequency of 50 year and 100 year extreme precipitation events will be doubled under rcp4 5 and tripled under rcp8 5 the expected changes in precipitation characteristics namely intensity duration and frequency idf curves must be incorporated for the future design of urban water systems as well as in adaptation planning the future projections of extreme precipitation and idf curves are however subject to uncertainty which also needs to be taken into consideration the uncertainty is larger for more extreme precipitation and with lesser extent dependent on duration being larger for shorter

5152,groundwater in surficial aquifers in small islands is stored in the form of freshwater lenses floating on the seawater due to density difference recharge from rainfall infiltration is one of the primary mechanisms that control the lens growth and decay unlike previous studies either assuming steady state groundwater lenses or relying on numerical simulations we derive an approximate analytical solution to describe the transient change of groundwater lenses for a time dependent fluctuating recharge rate the approximate analytical solution is validated by numerical simulations of variable density flow and transport based on this analytical solution and dimensional analysis we investigate the impact of periodic recharge extended drought events and random time series recharge on the time dependent behavior of the lens thickness and volume results show that only slowly changing recharge patterns with long periods such as seasonal and yearly changes can cause significant fluctuations of groundwater lenses in specific 10 50 and 100 fluctuations correspond to dimensionless periods of 200 500 and 1300 respectively which are 69 174 and 451 days for our specified hydrogeological parameters thus assuming an average constant recharge rate may be valid for simulating the transient lens profile and volume for recharge patterns with short periods such as daily fluctuations we further analyze the approximate analytical solution using the method of low pass filter the complex physical process of the lens development is fitted by a second order system on the frequency domain such a filter passes sine wave recharge components with frequencies smaller than the break frequency and attenuates those higher than the break frequency yielding smooth profiles of the lens thickness and volume by analyzing the recharge rate spectrum and comparing the component frequency with the break frequency we demonstrate how the development of a groundwater lens is affected by the transient recharge in reported laboratory and field observations keywords groundwater lens transient recharge strip island 1 introduction in past decades more frequent climate change related changing environmental conditions have emerged potentially affecting many vulnerable human groups of those groups island habitants are of concern in the present study because of their vulnerabilities to scarce freshwater resources campbell and barnett 2010 pelling and uitto 2001 yoshimoto et al 2020 there are over 100 000 islands on the oceans of the world and around 500 million people living on them dose et al 2014 freshwater is scarce on small islands due to the lack of natural surface water reservoirs dose et al 2014 stoeckl et al 2015 babu et al 2020 groundwater in surficial aquifers is often the primary source of freshwater supply for habitants on small islands stored in the form of freshwater lenses floating on the seawater due to density difference post et al 2019 better understanding of the growth and decay of such coastal groundwater lenses is necessary for designing sustainable groundwater use strategies to meet the increasing water needs of growing population and economic development on islands groundwater lenses can be influenced by numerous factors including hydrological conditions of aquifer formations climate change eg storm surges and precipitation sea level rise human activities and others terry and falkland 2010 chui and terry 2012 sulzbacher et al 2012 chui and terry 2015 alsumaiei and bailey 2018 post et al 2019 among those rainfall is considered to be a significant factor because recharge of lenses may largely rely on infiltration from precipitation on small islands yao et al 2019 ketabchi et al 2014 conducted sensitivity analysis of different factors and found the profound impact of recharge on the steady state volume of groundwater lenses based on a steady state analytical solution for two layered small island aquifers bailey et al 2009 showed that the maximum steady state lens thickness grows exponentially with the increasing recharge to investigate the impact of recharge rate on groundwater lenses analytical solutions based on the ghyben herzberg approximation and dupuit assumption were developed to describe the steady state interface profile of the groundwater lens in homogeneous circular islands fetter 1972 strip islands vacher 1988 two horizontally layered islands ketabchi et al 2014 and two vertically sliced islands lu et al 2019 for a given constant recharge rate yao et al 2019 used numerical models to investigate the groundwater lens development in heterogeneous reclaimed islands for a constant recharge rate however constant recharge is physically impossible because rainfall on the islands varies daily and seasonally thus it leaves us the questions is the assumption of a constant recharge rate valid and how do groundwater lenses respond to time dependent fluctuating precipitation and recharge laboratory experiments and field studies combining with numerical models have investigated the impact of recharge on groundwater lens development stoeckl and houben 2012 used numerical models and physical experiments to simulate the growth and degradation of groundwater lenses and found that lenses immediately decayed after terminating recharge and recovered to almost the surface level corresponding to zero recharge such rapid responses to changing recharge were also demonstrated by a recent laboratory tank experiment bedekar et al 2019 several field investigations have been implemented to study the effect of changing recharge patterns and drought events huizer et al 2018 examined the effect of actual recharge on the growth of lens on dutch coast between 2011 and 2016 their simulation showed that the changing recharge rate led to considerable reconstruction of groundwater lens bailey et al 2013 developed an algebraic model based on filed data to calculate the maximum lens thickness on the atolls of the federated states of micronesia in this model a drought factor was established to account for the effect of intense drought conditions on groundwater lenses alsumaiei and bailey 2018 conducted numerical simulations to evaluate the fluctuation of the lens volume for four representative islands in the republic of maldives their results showed that changing recharge patterns considerably influenced the volume of lenses on small islands similar field study also were conducted on rottnest island western australia bryan et al 2016 marshall islands barkey and bailey 2017 and bonriki island kiribati post et al 2018 however most numerical simulations and field investigations were site specific and the validity of generalizing those findings to other islands with different hydrogeologic and climate conditions is unclear in fact schneider and kruse 2006 showed that the depth of lenses had no response to seasonally varying recharge based on numerical simulations and field data alrashidi and bailey 2019 also found the lens has extremely slow response to reduced recharge in an arid region i e 50 reduction in annual recharge for 100 years corresponding to 9 reduction of lens volume for water quality threshold of 2000 mg l the controlling mechanism for such inconsistent observations remains unknown to the best of our knowledge there is no general conclusion about the transient changes of groundwater lenses in response to time dependent fluctuating recharge in summary previous research on the impact of recharge on groundwater lens either assumes steady state recharge or relies on site specific numerical modeling for transient recharge the former is more efficient and faster but ignores fluctuations of recharge in real world the latter is easy to handle transient recharge but hard to draw general conclusions because they are often computationally expensive and site specific in the present study we develop an efficient approximate analytical solution to describe the transient behavior of the seawater freshwater interface and groundwater lens volume by incorporating a classic sharp interface solution hantush 1968 with the signal processing approach for a linear time invariant lti system the analytical solution can be used to efficiently and systematically explore the transient behavior of interface shape and volume of groundwater lenses for time dependent fluctuating recharge and to effectively improve the understanding of the effects of inherent controlling mechanisms and hydrogeologic conditions to help predict groundwater resources on small islands under varying climate change related environmental conditions moreover the solution is approximated by an underdamped two order system which can act as a low pass filter and provide general insights and an efficient tool to investigate the effects of the transient recharge on groundwater lenses 2 conceptual model fig 1 represents typical two dimensional conceptual model of the fresh groundwater lens in small islands for simplicity we consider strip islands and linear flow equations the length of the island is considered much longer than its width 2 w l for circular islands w is the island radius and radial flow equations should be applied the aquifer is homogeneous isotropic and unconfined saltwater with a constant sea level invades from both sides of the island a specific recharge rate ω l t is assumed time dependent and uniformly distributed at the surface a groundwater lens is formed floating above the seawater due to density difference creating a sharp interface between freshwater and seawater the sharp interface approximation may not describe the dispersive mixing between freshwater and seawater but can provide important insights of the growth and decay of the groundwater lens and has been widely used to quantify seawater intrusion and saltwater upconing bower et al 1999 dagan and bear 1968 dagan and zeitoun 1998 muskat 1938 reilly and goodman 1987 the thickness of groundwater lens h is defined as the distance from the interface to the sea level which is a function of the distance to the island center the aquifer thickness is assumed to be greater than the maximum thickness of the groundwater lens 3 approximate analytical solution 3 1 hantush solution 1968 hantush 1968 provided an approximate analytical solution to describe the interface growth to the steady state profile given a constant recharge rate for a strip island without sea boundaries this solution neglects the storage effects of water expansion and aquifer compression i e all recharged water causes the increase of the lens thickness and the expansion of the lens volume in addition to the ghyben herzberg approximation and dupuit assumption the solution assumes that the groundwater lens thickness is proportional to the average hydraulic head between the water table and interface analogous to the assumption used to estimate the water table of single density flow in an unconfined aquifer moreover the solution only considers the recharge to the saturated zone and neglects the change of the unsaturated zone which was confirmed to be accurate for long term behavior by variable saturation numerical simulations ketabchi et al 2014 the solution describing the time dependent squared thickness from the initial condition of zero lens thickness i e the water table at the sea level is given by 1 h 2 x t ω h t 1 δ ε s n s n 2 n w x 4 k δ h t ε 3 n w x 4 k δ h t ε 4 s α 0 1 erf α τ d τ 5 δ ρ s ρ f ρ f where ρ s m l3 is density of seawater ρ f m l3 is density of freshwater ε is porosity t t is time k l t is hydraulic conductivity h l is the average of the areal distribution of the depth which is estimated using a trial method provided in a series of papers hantush 1964 1967 1968 the detailed procedure to get the estimated value of h for the specific condition in our study is shown in hantush 1968 to extend hantush solution for describing the conceptual model with constant sea level boundaries we can apply the method of image boundary to evaluate the interface profile 6 h 2 x z x i 1 1 i z 2 i w x z 2 i w x where z x is hantush solution given by eq 1 z x will decay dramatically with increasing x in our experiment we use four terms for the infinite series and our practice shows that the truncation error is smaller than 0 1 fig 2 shows the growth of groundwater lens thickness at different distances for a specific case given a set of typical hydrogeologic and geometric parameters the thickness increases from zero rapidly and gradually approaches its steady state thickness typically a long period up to years is needed for the lens to reach its steady state at the island center x 0 the lens thickness is the maximum over the whole domain the thickness of the groundwater lens or the depth of the interface decreases with the distance from the center forming the lens shape schematically shown in fig 1 3 2 dimensional analysis to generalize the solution we normalize the coordinate by the island width and define the following dimensionless variables 7 h h w ω ω k h h w t kt w ε x x w the solution eqs 1 3 can then be written as 8 h 2 x t ω h t 1 δ s n s n 9 n 1 x 4 δ h t 10 n 1 x 4 δ h t similar dimensionless variables are defined in previous studies e g ketabchi et al 2014 3 3 linear system approach for time dependent recharge the approximate analytical solution for the simplified system is linear in terms of the squared thickness h 2 thus the development of lenses at each location can be described by a linear convolution for a time dependent recharge rate 11 h 2 x t ω τ h x t τ d τ where h is known as the unit impulse response or transfer function of the squared thickness corresponding to a unit impulse recharge in such a system the recharge rate is considered as the input signal which triggers the system to generate the output signal h 2 a time dependent recharge to the system is decomposed into impulses of different magnitudes and the output is the sum of the responses for all impulse inputs the effects of all the other hydrogeologic parameters are described by the unit impulse response function which characterizes the inherent property of the system the dimensionless impulse response function h at a certain location can be derived as the following 12 h x t h 2 t ω h 1 δ s n s n ω h t 1 δ s n t s n t where 13 s n t s n n n t 14 s n t s n n n t and s n n 0 1 2 π τ e x p n 2 τ d τ 16 s n n 0 1 2 π τ e x p n 2 τ d τ

rapidly increase from zero indicating a prompt response to the recharge the peak values and times to reach the peak vary with the distance to the center at the center x 0 it has the highest peak value and the longest time to reach because the interface has the maximum thickness at this point after the peak the thickness gradually deceases to zero representing the system recovers to its initial state eventually the impulse recharge exerts no influence on the system after t 1300 since the unit impulse represents an unrealistic large recharge rate we scale the unit impulse δ t to 10 4 δ t and use the scaled impulse response functions to allow the model to be conveniently applied to physical systems the transient lens volume or area can be obtained by integrating the lens thickness over the domain 19 a t a w 2 2 0 1 h x t d x we shall notice that the lens volume or area is a nonlinear function 3 4 numerical comparison the approximate analytical solution is compared with a numerical model simulated by seawat langevin et al 2003 which couples variable density flow and transport and requires to define diffusion and dispersion coefficients the domain is divided into 600 150 grids with the fixed head on the two top corners each grid is of 1 m 1 m the selection of 150 m as the height is to guarantee the domain deep enough for lens development table 1 lists typical domain geometric and hydrogeologic parameters bailey et al 2013 bailey et al 2009 ketabchi et al 2014 stoeckl and houben 2012 which are also used as the base case for numerical simulations in the next section we simulate one recharge pattern consisted of five periods shown in fig 4 a each period is of 200 days the approximate analytical solution is described by calculating the impulse response function eq 12 and conducting the linear convolution eq 11 numerical simulations yield a thin mixing zone due to small dispersion which is not accounted for by the approximate analytical model to address the discrepancy researchers proposed to use the 50 concentration contour line in numerical simulations to represent the interface rathore et al 2018 2020 reilly and goodman 1987 fig 4 b clearly shows that the sharp interface predicted by the approximate analytical provides good approximation of the 50 concentration lines in numerical simulations we also show another example of comparison between numerical solutions and the approximate analytical solution in the supplementary material fig s1 to provide more validation for the analytical solution this example simulates one complete cycle of lens growth and decay the corresponding parameters are listed in table s1 although the approximate analytical solution may not provide accurate estimates of freshwater volume if a high water quality threshold such as the normalized salinity less than 0 001 is adopted it essentially characterizes the changing pattern of the lens profile which can provide useful insights on the transient behavior of interface profile and lens volume in response to time dependent recharge in addition we shall notice that numerical simulation of variable density flow and transport is often computationally expensive especially for a complex transient recharge pattern for example numerical modeling can only simulate discrete time dependent recharge when handling continuously changing recharge numerical modeling needs to transform input to short discrete periods to approximate the continuous pattern which makes the simulation cumbersome however both discrete and continuous time dependent recharge can be easily and fast implemented using analytical approach furthermore the analytical solution can substantially reduce computational costs for stochastic analysis based on multiple realizations to quantify uncertainties such as analysis of future climate change scenarios 4 numerical simulations in this section we use the approximate analytical solution to conduct numerical experiments to examine the transient behavior of the interface profile and total lens volume for three types of time dependent recharge rates periodic recharge extended drought events and random time series the interface profile behavior is represented by the lens thickness at the island center i e x 0 4 1 periodic recharge function we consider a periodic stepwise function as the recharge rate which switches between a high and low rate fig 5 a 20 ω t 2 10 4 2 i 1 t t 2 i 1 t i 1 2 3 1 10 4 2 i 1 t t 2 i t i 1 2 3 where t is the dimensionless half period and i is the number of periodic cycle we shall notice that within a long period of many recharge cycles the total durations of high and low recharge are equal and independent of the period and the average recharge rate is constant fig 5 b shows the response of the groundwater lens volume and thickness at the center for recharges with different periods the varying patterns for volume and thickness are very similar indicating the thickness at the center effectively represents the whole volume of the lens the three black dashed lines represent cases with a constant recharge of high value 2 10 4 low value 1 10 4 and the average value 1 5 10 4 respectively for all cases the lens volume or thickness initially grows along the high recharge curve because the periodic function starts at the high value and then fluctuates around the curve with the average recharge all curves are bounded by the high recharge and low recharge curves for longer periods i e larger t values the lens development shows more obvious periodic fluctuations in fact the curve of t 800 fluctuates down and up to both bounding curves for short periods such as t 100 only slight fluctuations can be observed thus for short recharge periods one may assume that the system is almost steady state at late time and it is reasonable to use the average recharge rate to describe the lens shape and estimate the lens volume fig 6 shows the volume fluctuation normalized by the difference between the two bounding curves which represents the potentially maximum volume change the fluctuation is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum of each curve for its stable fluctuation period ignoring the initial rising part the volume fluctuation increases with t fluctuations of 10 50 and 100 correspond to t 200 500 and 1300 respectively given the hydrogeologic parameters they correspond to t 69 days 174 days and 451 days respectively indicating that typically seasonal or yearly varying recharge is capable to cause apparent fluctuation of lens volume 4 2 extended drought events for simulating extended drought events we assume that the total yearly recharge is constant but there is a period of drought with no recharge we define an average monthly recharge rate at ω 10 7 m s three scenarios are considered the average recharge through a year the total recharge occurring in half a year and in a month the latter two represent a drought period of half a year and 11 months respectively correspondingly the recharge intensity is increased within the wet season to keep the total recharge constant fig 7 shows the periodic change of the lens volume and thickness at the center the initial stage i e the rising part in fig 5 is ignored since the total yearly recharge is constant both drought events fluctuate around the average recharge case however the longer drought event i e the one month rainfall case has a larger fluctuation amplitude with a higher peak and lower minimum because the case has a higher recharge rate during the rainfall season and a longer drought period indicating that elongated droughts have more substantial impact on the groundwater lens for the selected parameters the volume and thickness change ratios compared with the average value are about 60 and 25 for the scenarios with one month and six month recharge respectively 4 3 random time series recharge both previous two cases describe constant deterministic recharge patterns since precipitation is typically a changing time series the recharge rate is correspondingly considered as a time series random function in this case study we generate random time series of monthly recharge rates the total yearly recharge is constant and the monthly recharge is sampled by methods of fragments srikanthan and mcmahon 2001 twelve fragments are selected randomly from n sets of fragments generated by n year history data here we use rainfall data of st george island in florida usa data retrieved from florida climate center the total recharge of each year is set as the same value as that in section 4 2 fig 8 shows the fluctuating lens volume a and thickness b for one realization of random monthly recharge c similar to fig 5 the volume and thickness have greatly similar varying pattern it shows that the lens volume or thickness has a much slower varying frequency than the recharge because the change of volume or thickness is based on the superposition of all previous recharge which smooths the fluctuations in addition the mean case based on 5000 realizations of random monthly recharge is of a smaller fluctuation than individual realizations the periodicity of mean cases for both volume and thickness is similar to that in fig 7 indicating that the mean of random recharge reflects the pattern of recharge seasonal changing 5 low pass filter analysis as discussed above the lens interface profile is considered as a system response to the input signal i e the recharge rate to facilitate the understanding of this complex high order system behavior we simplify the impulse response by fitting a second order model for the frequency response oppenheim et al 1996 21 h j ω f 1 j ω f ω n 2 2 ζ j ω f ω n 1 where ζ is damping ratio ω n is undamped natural frequency ω f is variable frequency damping ratio is to describe how the system reduces its oscillation caused by disturbance and natural frequency is the rate of the oscillation with no force disturbing impulse and step response can be conveniently derived from frequency response as ζ decreases the oscillatory behavior becomes more obvious for both impulse and step response while as ζ increases to one oscillatory behavior disappears and step responses becomes slower indicating more time required for the system to approach its steady state ω n controls the scale of time and frequency because frequency response is a function of ω f ω n oppenheim et al 1996 the step responses at two locations the domain center and the edge are chosen to fit the second order frequency response model to represent the behavior of the system the fitted parameters are summarized in table 2 fig 9 shows that the lens thickness development is well described by the second order frequency response model the damping ratio ζ is less than but very close to 1 indicating that the system is underdamped with considerably damped oscillatory behavior corresponding to the non vibrant physical system in the real case the thickness development is a pure non vibrant process because the thickness of the lens will not exceed the final values in the process under a constant recharge the natural frequency ω n is small implying a slow process to reach the final state in fact the response timescale of t takes as high as 1300 to reach its final state this timescale value is consistent with that of the impulse response fig 3 in which the impulse input has no influence on the system after t 1300 i e the impulse completely passes the system and the system is back to stable fig 10 shows the bode plot of frequency responses at the two locations bode plot shows the magnitude attenuation for a sine wave as it passes the system the system with the kind of bode plot shown in fig 10 is considered as a low pass filter which only passes low frequency sine wave signals and rejects those with high frequencies there are two asymptotes in the magnitude plot for each curve one is at low frequency and parallel to x axis and the other asymptotically approaches the decreasing part of the curve both low and high frequency asymptotes are approximately straight lines and they meet at ω n the straight line approximation suggests that the magnitude of the frequency response is 0 db for ω f ω n and almost linearly decreases with frequency for ω f ω n ω n is referred to as the break frequency for input sine waves with ω f ω n their magnitudes will stay exactly the same after passing the system for those with the frequency larger than the break frequency magnitudes are reduced we notice that the high frequency asymptotes at the two locations are parallel with a slope of 40 db per decade that is the magnitude of h j ω f decreases 40 db for each increase of ω f by 10 times this slope suggests that this system attenuates steeply at high frequencies when the frequency of sine waves is larger than 0 1 the magnitude is reduced to nearly 0 001 of original magnitude that is these sine wave signals are rejected by the system additionally the bode plot for two points center and edge are very similar indicating that the capacity for the system to attenuate magnitude is greatly similar over the whole domain fig 11 shows the application of the spectrum analysis for the groundwater lens development with a periodic recharge time series the recharge rate signals with t 100 and t 800 are presented on the spectrum space based on fourier series analysis recharge with the longer periodic cycle is mostly decomposed into lower frequency sine waves as we discussed above frequency smaller than the break frequency can entirely pass the system with no reduction frequency between 0 1 and break frequency is attenuated to some degree frequencies higher than 0 1 can be considered as rejected for t 100 more sine wave components are distributed on the frequencies higher than 0 1 suggesting that more components are rejected that is why fig 5 shows that more frequent recharge pattern leads to weaker periodic outputs because most periodic components are blocked moreover the average recharge is the first term of fourier series representing the average value of the input over one periodic cycle thus given a constant average recharge all recharge cases in fig 5 have the same average value on their spectrums because the average point is of no frequency and not to be attenuated by the system all the curves in fig 5 grow around the curve of the average recharge rate if the recharge rate frequency is high enough all the components of this input will be rejected expect the average signal resulting in the smooth average lens volume curve without any fluctuation by contrast for the periodic recharge rate with t 800 obvious fluctuations of the lens volume can be observed since the input recharge signal is decomposed into sine waves with frequencies less than the break frequency in fig 9 t 1300 is the time when the system approaches the steady state the recharge needs to have a period comparable to such a timescale to cause significant fluctuations of the lens thickness realistically long changing timescale recharge represents long term drought or rainfall events by defining the timescale for the system to reach steady state as the responding timescale we may approximate the break frequency as ω n 2 π r e s p o n d i n g t i m e s c a l e in our case the responding timescale is around 1300 and thus the estimated break frequency is around 0 0048 close to the actual value shown in fig 10 6 implications on field and experimental cases the low pass filter analysis based on the impulse response of the lens thickness is applied to analyze the field case reported for st george island in florida usa schneider and kruse 2006 where the island is of a strip shape and satisfies the 2 d assumption in our model we calculate the monthly recharge recharge rainfall interception evapotranspiration based on the method provided in their study the average monthly rainfall data is retrieved from florida climate center from 1933 to 2014 is reduced to 85 to represent the effect of interception evapotranspiration is a fixed fraction of potential evapotranspiration computed from the thornthwaite equation schneider and kruse 2006 showed that the total potential evapotranspiration was 1 m per year we distribute 1 m to each month according to the relationship between monthly temperature data is retrieved from florida climate center from 1933 to 2014 and potential evapotranspiration in thornthwaite equation fig 12 a shows the average monthly recharge from 1933 to 2014 we assume the recharge pattern is a yearly periodic function i e the monthly pattern is constant for each year the spectrum of the recharge rate is shown in fig 12b as discussed above components with frequency higher than 0 1 will be rejected thus except the average point all other periodic components were blocked out therefore the lens showed no fluctuation and remained almost constant as the average recharge profile this analysis is consistent to the field investigation schneider and kruse 2006 in which it was found that the groundwater lens had no response to significant recharge variations on st george island the lens on this island remained constant for many years and the short cycle periodic recharge did not affect the lens more realistically rainfall varied each day and led to more frequent varying recharge inputs however the periodic components of such inputs were entirely rejected by the system thus it is reasonable to use the average recharge rate to estimate the groundwater lens profile and volume on the contrary in the lab experiments conducted by stoeckl and houben 2012 the lens had a rapid response to recharge change their lens decayed to almost original zero level within just hundreds of minutes it was much shorter than the periodic time in the example of st george island but caused obvious change of the lens in their experiments they applied the recharge ω 0 1 152 m day for t 0 250 min and then turned it off fig 13 shows the spectrum of this aperiodic recharge using fourier transformation according to frequency analysis the system will reject components with the frequency larger than 0 1 and entirely pass those smaller than the break frequency this spectrum has peak magnitude components smaller than break frequency 0 004 and a large range of components between the break frequency and 0 1 the former will pass through the system entirely and the latter will pass the system with reduction therefore this changing recharge is able to cause the lens to vary this explains the rapid response of the lens to the recharge change 7 conclusion in this paper we derive an approximate analytical solution for transient movement of groundwater lens interface in small strip islands for time dependent fluctuating recharge the system is approximated as a linear time invariant in terms of the squared lens thickness and described by the method of convolution where the transient recharge is considered as the input signal this analytical solution is validated by numerical simulations of variable density flow and transport we also derive a dimensionless formula for the solution which makes it convenient to evaluate the groundwater lens changing pattern for arbitrarily time dependent recharge we apply the approximate solution to study the effects of three different recharge patterns on the lens change periodic recharge extended drought events and random time series recharge for periodic recharge the lens thickness and volume changes are bounded by those lines corresponding to the high and low recharge rates and the amplitude of lens fluctuations is controlled by the magnitude of period fluctuations of 10 50 and 100 correspond to t 200 500 and 1300 and dimensional time t 69 days 174 days and 451 days given our specified hydrogeologic parameters respectively in general longer period yields larger fluctuations bounded by the curves of the highest and lowest recharge assuming an average constant recharge rate may be valid for simulating groundwater lens profile and volume for recharge patterns with short periods such as daily rainfall for drought events the duration of drought events affects the lens fluctuations also longer drought events yield larger lens fluctuations for random time series recharge the approximate analytical solution can provide fast evaluation of the ensemble mean and variance for uncertainty quantification which will be particularly useful to predict the lens change in future climate change scenarios with uncertainties by analyzing the impulse response function based on signal processing the inherent mechanism is explained on the frequency domain by the method of low pass filter the complex physical process of movement of lens is successfully fitted by a second order system this filter has the capacity to pass sine wave inputs with frequency lower than the break frequency while attenuate high frequency ones fourier series or fourier transformation is applied to decompose the time dependent recharge into sine wave components long changing time scale recharge can be decomposed into sine wave components lower than the break frequency and thus they are not blocked by the filter their changing pattern is able to pass the system and then cause the fluctuation of the lens one field case and laboratory experiment are analyzed by the concept of low pass filter their different behavior can be explained successfully by comparing their spectrums with the break frequency a flow chart is provided in supplementary material to show the complete procedure and methods our approach may not be used to accurately calculate the lens volume if a salty concentration is selected as the criterion for determining the freshwater quantity because the approach assumes sharp interface and neglects dispersion in addition the conceptual model neglects the change of the seawater boundary such as sea level rise and tidal effects further studies are underway by considering impact from both transient recharge and seawater boundaries however the present study provides us an efficient tool such as frequency analysis to investigate the transient lens change pattern as a result of time dependent fluctuating recharge rates more importantly it provides many useful insights to improve understanding of lens behavior as summarized above by substituting site parameters the dimensionless solutions can be used to analyze specific site conditions and predict potential behavior in future climate change scenarios credit authorship contribution statement yuening tang methodology investigation software validation formal analysis

5152,groundwater in surficial aquifers in small islands is stored in the form of freshwater lenses floating on the seawater due to density difference recharge from rainfall infiltration is one of the primary mechanisms that control the lens growth and decay unlike previous studies either assuming steady state groundwater lenses or relying on numerical simulations we derive an approximate analytical solution to describe the transient change of groundwater lenses for a time dependent fluctuating recharge rate the approximate analytical solution is validated by numerical simulations of variable density flow and transport based on this analytical solution and dimensional analysis we investigate the impact of periodic recharge extended drought events and random time series recharge on the time dependent behavior of the lens thickness and volume results show that only slowly changing recharge patterns with long periods such as seasonal and yearly changes can cause significant fluctuations of groundwater lenses in specific 10 50 and 100 fluctuations correspond to dimensionless periods of 200 500 and 1300 respectively which are 69 174 and 451 days for our specified hydrogeological parameters thus assuming an average constant recharge rate may be valid for simulating the transient lens profile and volume for recharge patterns with short periods such as daily fluctuations we further analyze the approximate analytical solution using the method of low pass filter the complex physical process of the lens development is fitted by a second order system on the frequency domain such a filter passes sine wave recharge components with frequencies smaller than the break frequency and attenuates those higher than the break frequency yielding smooth profiles of the lens thickness and volume by analyzing the recharge rate spectrum and comparing the component frequency with the break frequency we demonstrate how the development of a groundwater lens is affected by the transient recharge in reported laboratory and field observations keywords groundwater lens transient recharge strip island 1 introduction in past decades more frequent climate change related changing environmental conditions have emerged potentially affecting many vulnerable human groups of those groups island habitants are of concern in the present study because of their vulnerabilities to scarce freshwater resources campbell and barnett 2010 pelling and uitto 2001 yoshimoto et al 2020 there are over 100 000 islands on the oceans of the world and around 500 million people living on them dose et al 2014 freshwater is scarce on small islands due to the lack of natural surface water reservoirs dose et al 2014 stoeckl et al 2015 babu et al 2020 groundwater in surficial aquifers is often the primary source of freshwater supply for habitants on small islands stored in the form of freshwater lenses floating on the seawater due to density difference post et al 2019 better understanding of the growth and decay of such coastal groundwater lenses is necessary for designing sustainable groundwater use strategies to meet the increasing water needs of growing population and economic development on islands groundwater lenses can be influenced by numerous factors including hydrological conditions of aquifer formations climate change eg storm surges and precipitation sea level rise human activities and others terry and falkland 2010 chui and terry 2012 sulzbacher et al 2012 chui and terry 2015 alsumaiei and bailey 2018 post et al 2019 among those rainfall is considered to be a significant factor because recharge of lenses may largely rely on infiltration from precipitation on small islands yao et al 2019 ketabchi et al 2014 conducted sensitivity analysis of different factors and found the profound impact of recharge on the steady state volume of groundwater lenses based on a steady state analytical solution for two layered small island aquifers bailey et al 2009 showed that the maximum steady state lens thickness grows exponentially with the increasing recharge to investigate the impact of recharge rate on groundwater lenses analytical solutions based on the ghyben herzberg approximation and dupuit assumption were developed to describe the steady state interface profile of the groundwater lens in homogeneous circular islands fetter 1972 strip islands vacher 1988 two horizontally layered islands ketabchi et al 2014 and two vertically sliced islands lu et al 2019 for a given constant recharge rate yao et al 2019 used numerical models to investigate the groundwater lens development in heterogeneous reclaimed islands for a constant recharge rate however constant recharge is physically impossible because rainfall on the islands varies daily and seasonally thus it leaves us the questions is the assumption of a constant recharge rate valid and how do groundwater lenses respond to time dependent fluctuating precipitation and recharge laboratory experiments and field studies combining with numerical models have investigated the impact of recharge on groundwater lens development stoeckl and houben 2012 used numerical models and physical experiments to simulate the growth and degradation of groundwater lenses and found that lenses immediately decayed after terminating recharge and recovered to almost the surface level corresponding to zero recharge such rapid responses to changing recharge were also demonstrated by a recent laboratory tank experiment bedekar et al 2019 several field investigations have been implemented to study the effect of changing recharge patterns and drought events huizer et al 2018 examined the effect of actual recharge on the growth of lens on dutch coast between 2011 and 2016 their simulation showed that the changing recharge rate led to considerable reconstruction of groundwater lens bailey et al 2013 developed an algebraic model based on filed data to calculate the maximum lens thickness on the atolls of the federated states of micronesia in this model a drought factor was established to account for the effect of intense drought conditions on groundwater lenses alsumaiei and bailey 2018 conducted numerical simulations to evaluate the fluctuation of the lens volume for four representative islands in the republic of maldives their results showed that changing recharge patterns considerably influenced the volume of lenses on small islands similar field study also were conducted on rottnest island western australia bryan et al 2016 marshall islands barkey and bailey 2017 and bonriki island kiribati post et al 2018 however most numerical simulations and field investigations were site specific and the validity of generalizing those findings to other islands with different hydrogeologic and climate conditions is unclear in fact schneider and kruse 2006 showed that the depth of lenses had no response to seasonally varying recharge based on numerical simulations and field data alrashidi and bailey 2019 also found the lens has extremely slow response to reduced recharge in an arid region i e 50 reduction in annual recharge for 100 years corresponding to 9 reduction of lens volume for water quality threshold of 2000 mg l the controlling mechanism for such inconsistent observations remains unknown to the best of our knowledge there is no general conclusion about the transient changes of groundwater lenses in response to time dependent fluctuating recharge in summary previous research on the impact of recharge on groundwater lens either assumes steady state recharge or relies on site specific numerical modeling for transient recharge the former is more efficient and faster but ignores fluctuations of recharge in real world the latter is easy to handle transient recharge but hard to draw general conclusions because they are often computationally expensive and site specific in the present study we develop an efficient approximate analytical solution to describe the transient behavior of the seawater freshwater interface and groundwater lens volume by incorporating a classic sharp interface solution hantush 1968 with the signal processing approach for a linear time invariant lti system the analytical solution can be used to efficiently and systematically explore the transient behavior of interface shape and volume of groundwater lenses for time dependent fluctuating recharge and to effectively improve the understanding of the effects of inherent controlling mechanisms and hydrogeologic conditions to help predict groundwater resources on small islands under varying climate change related environmental conditions moreover the solution is approximated by an underdamped two order system which can act as a low pass filter and provide general insights and an efficient tool to investigate the effects of the transient recharge on groundwater lenses 2 conceptual model fig 1 represents typical two dimensional conceptual model of the fresh groundwater lens in small islands for simplicity we consider strip islands and linear flow equations the length of the island is considered much longer than its width 2 w l for circular islands w is the island radius and radial flow equations should be applied the aquifer is homogeneous isotropic and unconfined saltwater with a constant sea level invades from both sides of the island a specific recharge rate ω l t is assumed time dependent and uniformly distributed at the surface a groundwater lens is formed floating above the seawater due to density difference creating a sharp interface between freshwater and seawater the sharp interface approximation may not describe the dispersive mixing between freshwater and seawater but can provide important insights of the growth and decay of the groundwater lens and has been widely used to quantify seawater intrusion and saltwater upconing bower et al 1999 dagan and bear 1968 dagan and zeitoun 1998 muskat 1938 reilly and goodman 1987 the thickness of groundwater lens h is defined as the distance from the interface to the sea level which is a function of the distance to the island center the aquifer thickness is assumed to be greater than the maximum thickness of the groundwater lens 3 approximate analytical solution 3 1 hantush solution 1968 hantush 1968 provided an approximate analytical solution to describe the interface growth to the steady state profile given a constant recharge rate for a strip island without sea boundaries this solution neglects the storage effects of water expansion and aquifer compression i e all recharged water causes the increase of the lens thickness and the expansion of the lens volume in addition to the ghyben herzberg approximation and dupuit assumption the solution assumes that the groundwater lens thickness is proportional to the average hydraulic head between the water table and interface analogous to the assumption used to estimate the water table of single density flow in an unconfined aquifer moreover the solution only considers the recharge to the saturated zone and neglects the change of the unsaturated zone which was confirmed to be accurate for long term behavior by variable saturation numerical simulations ketabchi et al 2014 the solution describing the time dependent squared thickness from the initial condition of zero lens thickness i e the water table at the sea level is given by 1 h 2 x t ω h t 1 δ ε s n s n 2 n w x 4 k δ h t ε 3 n w x 4 k δ h t ε 4 s α 0 1 erf α τ d τ 5 δ ρ s ρ f ρ f where ρ s m l3 is density of seawater ρ f m l3 is density of freshwater ε is porosity t t is time k l t is hydraulic conductivity h l is the average of the areal distribution of the depth which is estimated using a trial method provided in a series of papers hantush 1964 1967 1968 the detailed procedure to get the estimated value of h for the specific condition in our study is shown in hantush 1968 to extend hantush solution for describing the conceptual model with constant sea level boundaries we can apply the method of image boundary to evaluate the interface profile 6 h 2 x z x i 1 1 i z 2 i w x z 2 i w x where z x is hantush solution given by eq 1 z x will decay dramatically with increasing x in our experiment we use four terms for the infinite series and our practice shows that the truncation error is smaller than 0 1 fig 2 shows the growth of groundwater lens thickness at different distances for a specific case given a set of typical hydrogeologic and geometric parameters the thickness increases from zero rapidly and gradually approaches its steady state thickness typically a long period up to years is needed for the lens to reach its steady state at the island center x 0 the lens thickness is the maximum over the whole domain the thickness of the groundwater lens or the depth of the interface decreases with the distance from the center forming the lens shape schematically shown in fig 1 3 2 dimensional analysis to generalize the solution we normalize the coordinate by the island width and define the following dimensionless variables 7 h h w ω ω k h h w t kt w ε x x w the solution eqs 1 3 can then be written as 8 h 2 x t ω h t 1 δ s n s n 9 n 1 x 4 δ h t 10 n 1 x 4 δ h t similar dimensionless variables are defined in previous studies e g ketabchi et al 2014 3 3 linear system approach for time dependent recharge the approximate analytical solution for the simplified system is linear in terms of the squared thickness h 2 thus the development of lenses at each location can be described by a linear convolution for a time dependent recharge rate 11 h 2 x t ω τ h x t τ d τ where h is known as the unit impulse response or transfer function of the squared thickness corresponding to a unit impulse recharge in such a system the recharge rate is considered as the input signal which triggers the system to generate the output signal h 2 a time dependent recharge to the system is decomposed into impulses of different magnitudes and the output is the sum of the responses for all impulse inputs the effects of all the other hydrogeologic parameters are described by the unit impulse response function which characterizes the inherent property of the system the dimensionless impulse response function h at a certain location can be derived as the following 12 h x t h 2 t ω h 1 δ s n s n ω h t 1 δ s n t s n t where 13 s n t s n n n t 14 s n t s n n n t and s n n 0 1 2 π τ e x p n 2 τ d τ 16 s n n 0 1 2 π τ e x p n 2 τ d τ

rapidly increase from zero indicating a prompt response to the recharge the peak values and times to reach the peak vary with the distance to the center at the center x 0 it has the highest peak value and the longest time to reach because the interface has the maximum thickness at this point after the peak the thickness gradually deceases to zero representing the system recovers to its initial state eventually the impulse recharge exerts no influence on the system after t 1300 since the unit impulse represents an unrealistic large recharge rate we scale the unit impulse δ t to 10 4 δ t and use the scaled impulse response functions to allow the model to be conveniently applied to physical systems the transient lens volume or area can be obtained by integrating the lens thickness over the domain 19 a t a w 2 2 0 1 h x t d x we shall notice that the lens volume or area is a nonlinear function 3 4 numerical comparison the approximate analytical solution is compared with a numerical model simulated by seawat langevin et al 2003 which couples variable density flow and transport and requires to define diffusion and dispersion coefficients the domain is divided into 600 150 grids with the fixed head on the two top corners each grid is of 1 m 1 m the selection of 150 m as the height is to guarantee the domain deep enough for lens development table 1 lists typical domain geometric and hydrogeologic parameters bailey et al 2013 bailey et al 2009 ketabchi et al 2014 stoeckl and houben 2012 which are also used as the base case for numerical simulations in the next section we simulate one recharge pattern consisted of five periods shown in fig 4 a each period is of 200 days the approximate analytical solution is described by calculating the impulse response function eq 12 and conducting the linear convolution eq 11 numerical simulations yield a thin mixing zone due to small dispersion which is not accounted for by the approximate analytical model to address the discrepancy researchers proposed to use the 50 concentration contour line in numerical simulations to represent the interface rathore et al 2018 2020 reilly and goodman 1987 fig 4 b clearly shows that the sharp interface predicted by the approximate analytical provides good approximation of the 50 concentration lines in numerical simulations we also show another example of comparison between numerical solutions and the approximate analytical solution in the supplementary material fig s1 to provide more validation for the analytical solution this example simulates one complete cycle of lens growth and decay the corresponding parameters are listed in table s1 although the approximate analytical solution may not provide accurate estimates of freshwater volume if a high water quality threshold such as the normalized salinity less than 0 001 is adopted it essentially characterizes the changing pattern of the lens profile which can provide useful insights on the transient behavior of interface profile and lens volume in response to time dependent recharge in addition we shall notice that numerical simulation of variable density flow and transport is often computationally expensive especially for a complex transient recharge pattern for example numerical modeling can only simulate discrete time dependent recharge when handling continuously changing recharge numerical modeling needs to transform input to short discrete periods to approximate the continuous pattern which makes the simulation cumbersome however both discrete and continuous time dependent recharge can be easily and fast implemented using analytical approach furthermore the analytical solution can substantially reduce computational costs for stochastic analysis based on multiple realizations to quantify uncertainties such as analysis of future climate change scenarios 4 numerical simulations in this section we use the approximate analytical solution to conduct numerical experiments to examine the transient behavior of the interface profile and total lens volume for three types of time dependent recharge rates periodic recharge extended drought events and random time series the interface profile behavior is represented by the lens thickness at the island center i e x 0 4 1 periodic recharge function we consider a periodic stepwise function as the recharge rate which switches between a high and low rate fig 5 a 20 ω t 2 10 4 2 i 1 t t 2 i 1 t i 1 2 3 1 10 4 2 i 1 t t 2 i t i 1 2 3 where t is the dimensionless half period and i is the number of periodic cycle we shall notice that within a long period of many recharge cycles the total durations of high and low recharge are equal and independent of the period and the average recharge rate is constant fig 5 b shows the response of the groundwater lens volume and thickness at the center for recharges with different periods the varying patterns for volume and thickness are very similar indicating the thickness at the center effectively represents the whole volume of the lens the three black dashed lines represent cases with a constant recharge of high value 2 10 4 low value 1 10 4 and the average value 1 5 10 4 respectively for all cases the lens volume or thickness initially grows along the high recharge curve because the periodic function starts at the high value and then fluctuates around the curve with the average recharge all curves are bounded by the high recharge and low recharge curves for longer periods i e larger t values the lens development shows more obvious periodic fluctuations in fact the curve of t 800 fluctuates down and up to both bounding curves for short periods such as t 100 only slight fluctuations can be observed thus for short recharge periods one may assume that the system is almost steady state at late time and it is reasonable to use the average recharge rate to describe the lens shape and estimate the lens volume fig 6 shows the volume fluctuation normalized by the difference between the two bounding curves which represents the potentially maximum volume change the fluctuation is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum of each curve for its stable fluctuation period ignoring the initial rising part the volume fluctuation increases with t fluctuations of 10 50 and 100 correspond to t 200 500 and 1300 respectively given the hydrogeologic parameters they correspond to t 69 days 174 days and 451 days respectively indicating that typically seasonal or yearly varying recharge is capable to cause apparent fluctuation of lens volume 4 2 extended drought events for simulating extended drought events we assume that the total yearly recharge is constant but there is a period of drought with no recharge we define an average monthly recharge rate at ω 10 7 m s three scenarios are considered the average recharge through a year the total recharge occurring in half a year and in a month the latter two represent a drought period of half a year and 11 months respectively correspondingly the recharge intensity is increased within the wet season to keep the total recharge constant fig 7 shows the periodic change of the lens volume and thickness at the center the initial stage i e the rising part in fig 5 is ignored since the total yearly recharge is constant both drought events fluctuate around the average recharge case however the longer drought event i e the one month rainfall case has a larger fluctuation amplitude with a higher peak and lower minimum because the case has a higher recharge rate during the rainfall season and a longer drought period indicating that elongated droughts have more substantial impact on the groundwater lens for the selected parameters the volume and thickness change ratios compared with the average value are about 60 and 25 for the scenarios with one month and six month recharge respectively 4 3 random time series recharge both previous two cases describe constant deterministic recharge patterns since precipitation is typically a changing time series the recharge rate is correspondingly considered as a time series random function in this case study we generate random time series of monthly recharge rates the total yearly recharge is constant and the monthly recharge is sampled by methods of fragments srikanthan and mcmahon 2001 twelve fragments are selected randomly from n sets of fragments generated by n year history data here we use rainfall data of st george island in florida usa data retrieved from florida climate center the total recharge of each year is set as the same value as that in section 4 2 fig 8 shows the fluctuating lens volume a and thickness b for one realization of random monthly recharge c similar to fig 5 the volume and thickness have greatly similar varying pattern it shows that the lens volume or thickness has a much slower varying frequency than the recharge because the change of volume or thickness is based on the superposition of all previous recharge which smooths the fluctuations in addition the mean case based on 5000 realizations of random monthly recharge is of a smaller fluctuation than individual realizations the periodicity of mean cases for both volume and thickness is similar to that in fig 7 indicating that the mean of random recharge reflects the pattern of recharge seasonal changing 5 low pass filter analysis as discussed above the lens interface profile is considered as a system response to the input signal i e the recharge rate to facilitate the understanding of this complex high order system behavior we simplify the impulse response by fitting a second order model for the frequency response oppenheim et al 1996 21 h j ω f 1 j ω f ω n 2 2 ζ j ω f ω n 1 where ζ is damping ratio ω n is undamped natural frequency ω f is variable frequency damping ratio is to describe how the system reduces its oscillation caused by disturbance and natural frequency is the rate of the oscillation with no force disturbing impulse and step response can be conveniently derived from frequency response as ζ decreases the oscillatory behavior becomes more obvious for both impulse and step response while as ζ increases to one oscillatory behavior disappears and step responses becomes slower indicating more time required for the system to approach its steady state ω n controls the scale of time and frequency because frequency response is a function of ω f ω n oppenheim et al 1996 the step responses at two locations the domain center and the edge are chosen to fit the second order frequency response model to represent the behavior of the system the fitted parameters are summarized in table 2 fig 9 shows that the lens thickness development is well described by the second order frequency response model the damping ratio ζ is less than but very close to 1 indicating that the system is underdamped with considerably damped oscillatory behavior corresponding to the non vibrant physical system in the real case the thickness development is a pure non vibrant process because the thickness of the lens will not exceed the final values in the process under a constant recharge the natural frequency ω n is small implying a slow process to reach the final state in fact the response timescale of t takes as high as 1300 to reach its final state this timescale value is consistent with that of the impulse response fig 3 in which the impulse input has no influence on the system after t 1300 i e the impulse completely passes the system and the system is back to stable fig 10 shows the bode plot of frequency responses at the two locations bode plot shows the magnitude attenuation for a sine wave as it passes the system the system with the kind of bode plot shown in fig 10 is considered as a low pass filter which only passes low frequency sine wave signals and rejects those with high frequencies there are two asymptotes in the magnitude plot for each curve one is at low frequency and parallel to x axis and the other asymptotically approaches the decreasing part of the curve both low and high frequency asymptotes are approximately straight lines and they meet at ω n the straight line approximation suggests that the magnitude of the frequency response is 0 db for ω f ω n and almost linearly decreases with frequency for ω f ω n ω n is referred to as the break frequency for input sine waves with ω f ω n their magnitudes will stay exactly the same after passing the system for those with the frequency larger than the break frequency magnitudes are reduced we notice that the high frequency asymptotes at the two locations are parallel with a slope of 40 db per decade that is the magnitude of h j ω f decreases 40 db for each increase of ω f by 10 times this slope suggests that this system attenuates steeply at high frequencies when the frequency of sine waves is larger than 0 1 the magnitude is reduced to nearly 0 001 of original magnitude that is these sine wave signals are rejected by the system additionally the bode plot for two points center and edge are very similar indicating that the capacity for the system to attenuate magnitude is greatly similar over the whole domain fig 11 shows the application of the spectrum analysis for the groundwater lens development with a periodic recharge time series the recharge rate signals with t 100 and t 800 are presented on the spectrum space based on fourier series analysis recharge with the longer periodic cycle is mostly decomposed into lower frequency sine waves as we discussed above frequency smaller than the break frequency can entirely pass the system with no reduction frequency between 0 1 and break frequency is attenuated to some degree frequencies higher than 0 1 can be considered as rejected for t 100 more sine wave components are distributed on the frequencies higher than 0 1 suggesting that more components are rejected that is why fig 5 shows that more frequent recharge pattern leads to weaker periodic outputs because most periodic components are blocked moreover the average recharge is the first term of fourier series representing the average value of the input over one periodic cycle thus given a constant average recharge all recharge cases in fig 5 have the same average value on their spectrums because the average point is of no frequency and not to be attenuated by the system all the curves in fig 5 grow around the curve of the average recharge rate if the recharge rate frequency is high enough all the components of this input will be rejected expect the average signal resulting in the smooth average lens volume curve without any fluctuation by contrast for the periodic recharge rate with t 800 obvious fluctuations of the lens volume can be observed since the input recharge signal is decomposed into sine waves with frequencies less than the break frequency in fig 9 t 1300 is the time when the system approaches the steady state the recharge needs to have a period comparable to such a timescale to cause significant fluctuations of the lens thickness realistically long changing timescale recharge represents long term drought or rainfall events by defining the timescale for the system to reach steady state as the responding timescale we may approximate the break frequency as ω n 2 π r e s p o n d i n g t i m e s c a l e in our case the responding timescale is around 1300 and thus the estimated break frequency is around 0 0048 close to the actual value shown in fig 10 6 implications on field and experimental cases the low pass filter analysis based on the impulse response of the lens thickness is applied to analyze the field case reported for st george island in florida usa schneider and kruse 2006 where the island is of a strip shape and satisfies the 2 d assumption in our model we calculate the monthly recharge recharge rainfall interception evapotranspiration based on the method provided in their study the average monthly rainfall data is retrieved from florida climate center from 1933 to 2014 is reduced to 85 to represent the effect of interception evapotranspiration is a fixed fraction of potential evapotranspiration computed from the thornthwaite equation schneider and kruse 2006 showed that the total potential evapotranspiration was 1 m per year we distribute 1 m to each month according to the relationship between monthly temperature data is retrieved from florida climate center from 1933 to 2014 and potential evapotranspiration in thornthwaite equation fig 12 a shows the average monthly recharge from 1933 to 2014 we assume the recharge pattern is a yearly periodic function i e the monthly pattern is constant for each year the spectrum of the recharge rate is shown in fig 12b as discussed above components with frequency higher than 0 1 will be rejected thus except the average point all other periodic components were blocked out therefore the lens showed no fluctuation and remained almost constant as the average recharge profile this analysis is consistent to the field investigation schneider and kruse 2006 in which it was found that the groundwater lens had no response to significant recharge variations on st george island the lens on this island remained constant for many years and the short cycle periodic recharge did not affect the lens more realistically rainfall varied each day and led to more frequent varying recharge inputs however the periodic components of such inputs were entirely rejected by the system thus it is reasonable to use the average recharge rate to estimate the groundwater lens profile and volume on the contrary in the lab experiments conducted by stoeckl and houben 2012 the lens had a rapid response to recharge change their lens decayed to almost original zero level within just hundreds of minutes it was much shorter than the periodic time in the example of st george island but caused obvious change of the lens in their experiments they applied the recharge ω 0 1 152 m day for t 0 250 min and then turned it off fig 13 shows the spectrum of this aperiodic recharge using fourier transformation according to frequency analysis the system will reject components with the frequency larger than 0 1 and entirely pass those smaller than the break frequency this spectrum has peak magnitude components smaller than break frequency 0 004 and a large range of components between the break frequency and 0 1 the former will pass through the system entirely and the latter will pass the system with reduction therefore this changing recharge is able to cause the lens to vary this explains the rapid response of the lens to the recharge change 7 conclusion in this paper we derive an approximate analytical solution for transient movement of groundwater lens interface in small strip islands for time dependent fluctuating recharge the system is approximated as a linear time invariant in terms of the squared lens thickness and described by the method of convolution where the transient recharge is considered as the input signal this analytical solution is validated by numerical simulations of variable density flow and transport we also derive a dimensionless formula for the solution which makes it convenient to evaluate the groundwater lens changing pattern for arbitrarily time dependent recharge we apply the approximate solution to study the effects of three different recharge patterns on the lens change periodic recharge extended drought events and random time series recharge for periodic recharge the lens thickness and volume changes are bounded by those lines corresponding to the high and low recharge rates and the amplitude of lens fluctuations is controlled by the magnitude of period fluctuations of 10 50 and 100 correspond to t 200 500 and 1300 and dimensional time t 69 days 174 days and 451 days given our specified hydrogeologic parameters respectively in general longer period yields larger fluctuations bounded by the curves of the highest and lowest recharge assuming an average constant recharge rate may be valid for simulating groundwater lens profile and volume for recharge patterns with short periods such as daily rainfall for drought events the duration of drought events affects the lens fluctuations also longer drought events yield larger lens fluctuations for random time series recharge the approximate analytical solution can provide fast evaluation of the ensemble mean and variance for uncertainty quantification which will be particularly useful to predict the lens change in future climate change scenarios with uncertainties by analyzing the impulse response function based on signal processing the inherent mechanism is explained on the frequency domain by the method of low pass filter the complex physical process of movement of lens is successfully fitted by a second order system this filter has the capacity to pass sine wave inputs with frequency lower than the break frequency while attenuate high frequency ones fourier series or fourier transformation is applied to decompose the time dependent recharge into sine wave components long changing time scale recharge can be decomposed into sine wave components lower than the break frequency and thus they are not blocked by the filter their changing pattern is able to pass the system and then cause the fluctuation of the lens one field case and laboratory experiment are analyzed by the concept of low pass filter their different behavior can be explained successfully by comparing their spectrums with the break frequency a flow chart is provided in supplementary material to show the complete procedure and methods our approach may not be used to accurately calculate the lens volume if a salty concentration is selected as the criterion for determining the freshwater quantity because the approach assumes sharp interface and neglects dispersion in addition the conceptual model neglects the change of the seawater boundary such as sea level rise and tidal effects further studies are underway by considering impact from both transient recharge and seawater boundaries however the present study provides us an efficient tool such as frequency analysis to investigate the transient lens change pattern as a result of time dependent fluctuating recharge rates more importantly it provides many useful insights to improve understanding of lens behavior as summarized above by substituting site parameters the dimensionless solutions can be used to analyze specific site conditions and predict potential behavior in future climate change scenarios credit authorship contribution statement yuening tang methodology investigation software validation formal analysis

5153,rivers solid discharge represents a substantial environmental issue especially for the coastal marine environment unlike continental climate rivers mediterranean rivers show large discharge variability linked to rainfall runoff and groundwater discharge and can be temporary dry solid yields are difficult to predict due to variable source of floodwater this paper assesses the suspended solid discharge of the las river se france a small stream in karst and urban environments and its proportion due to flood events floods characteristics are analyzed to explore the variability of the solid yield and the influence of urban runoff and karst springs discharge based on in situ data the 35 floods events monitored during a 17 months survey largely contributed to the annual yield with a proportion of 47 of the total water and 69 of the total solid yielded in 11 of the time the total rainfall and the total water discharge related to the water levels in karst springs drive the total solid yield mostly composed of mud 90 urban runoff induces higher suspended solid concentration than karst flood but generated a lower total solid yield karst springs by expanding the catchment area of the stream largely contribute to the total volume of water discharged to the sea and enhance the sand proportion due to their influence on the maximal water discharge these results reveal the strong influence of the karst spring hydrodynamic functioning on the sediment yield to mediterranean coastal environments this study also highlights the efficiency of electric conductivity data to provide valuable insights about floodwater sources and sediment transport processes keywords solid discharge flood runoff urban stream karst spring bay of toulon 1 introduction coastal areas are very sensitive zones impacted by many anthropogenic and natural factors where continental activities strongly influence the marine environment through rivers discharges sediments play an essential role in both aquatic and marine environments as they influence nutrients dynamics but also contribute to contaminants transport although essential for bio geochemical activities and responsible for some marine pollution sediment fluxes in small rivers are poorly documented rivers solid discharge thereby represents a substantial environmental issue especially for the coastal marine environment unlike continental climate rivers mediterranean rivers show large discharge variability struglia et al 2004 and solid yields are difficult to predict due to variable rainfall events and rivers temporary character de girolamo et al 2015 a temporal average is barely significant because of the considerable discharge variation between the low flow and flood hydrologic sources include karst springs rainfall events and urban runoff while anthropogenic activities and uses of the watershed primarily impact rivers discharge cudennec et al 2007 one may then be concerned by rivers solid discharge in coastal areas especially in a mediterranean highly touristic and marine based economic region quantification of sediment fluxes is all the more important in the mediterranean region and arid and semi arid areas given that long dry periods and intense rainstorms cause unpredictable flash flood of not only rivers but also temporary streams gaume et al 2009 a single flash flood event may alter the physical characteristics of the seawater column near the river s outlet for several days and its surface water for one month capello et al 2016 small rivers and ephemeral streams are generally un gauged and little studied due to their limited economic impact despite the need to understand their dynamics and processes tzoraki et al 2007 skoulikidis amaxidis 2009 temporary rivers catchments yet represent 30 of the mediterranean region moraetis et al 2010 and their solid discharge might represent a significant proportion of total solid yield for instance nicolau et al 2012 estimated that flood discharge of the eygoutier river southern france catchment 70 km2 was responsible for more than 90 of the annual yield of suspended solids and particulate copper cu zinc zn cadmium cd and lead pb large flood event in the têt river southern france catchment 1400 km2 yielded about half of the annual total load within only a few days bourrin et al 2008 between 1980 and 1999 78 of the total sediment was discharged from the têt river to the gulf of lion western mediterranean within 50 days serrat et al 2001 the solid discharge due to floods events in small coastal mediterranean rivers is expected to contribute significantly to the total solid yield small rivers and urban streams have yet been understudied but their contributions are commonly crucial for the local economy flood risk assessment and management and water supply skoulikidis et al 2017 their solid yields are also essential for the sedimentary budget of the entire marine system triggered by rainfall snowmelt or karst springs flood events characterization usually relies on water discharge several other hydrological parameters and flood characteristics also provide insights on the solid discharge and the total yield the event duration lópez tarazón et al 2010 the highest water discharge during the flood alexandrov et al 2003 zabaleta et al 2007 lópez tarazón et al 2010 lópez tarazón et al 2012 and the total water volume serrat et al 2001 meybeck et al 2003 lópez tarazón et al 2010 are used in several studies to characterize flood events suspended solid characteristics like the highest suspended solid concentration ssc meybeck et al 2003 zabaleta et al 2007 nadal romero et al 2008 the total suspended sediment yield serrat 1999 meybeck et al 2003 zabaleta et al 2007 and the grain size characteristics antonelli et al 2008 shed light on the solid discharge variability finally rainfall parameters such as the total rainfall the rainfall intensity and the antecedent rainfall jungerius ten harkel 1994 alexandrov et al 2007 zabaleta et al 2007 nadal romero et al 2008 lópez tarazón et al 2010 may also impact the solid discharge because the electric conductivity ec acts as a tracer of the source of water and mixing processes it has also been used to characterize flood events e g pilgrim et al 1979 valdes et al 2006 pellerin et al 2008 meriano et al 2011 rainwater coming from evaporation and then condensation has a very low ec around 0 μs cm 1 following contact with surrounding soils runoff may increase stream conductivity robson et al 1993 karst springs also show specific ec that may act as a signature and lead to identify hydrological processes provided that the water ec is sufficiently distinct to distinguish the different contributions to the discharge the flood event characteristics might thus be linked to the water sources runoff or karst with ec data i e robson et al 1992 valdes et al 2006 perrin tournoud 2009 in this study we focus on the las river in southern france a typical small karst and urban mediterranean coastal river carbonate rocks occupy 21 6 of the european land surface chen et al 2017 where they form the dominant coastal rock in the northern part of the mediterranean sea fleury et al 2007a mostly forming karst aquifers their recharge area is usually distinct from the watershed by enlarging the total catchment area of a stream karst aquifers often increase both the water discharge and the sediment reserve karst aquifers also have a peculiar hydrodynamic functioning due to large and permeable conduits related to the speleogenetic history of the carbonate rocks jouves et al 2017 groundwater flows through the karst network and converges to the springs that concentrate the water discharge in few outlets karst springs discharge is then highly variable and can lead to flash flood gaume et al 2009 fleury et al 2013 this paper aims to assess the total solid yield of a small urban river to the mediterranean sea and to explore floods characteristics influencing its solid discharge not only we estimate the annual solid yield but we also analyze hydrological data from 35 events to focus on floods characteristics and to assess the solid discharge variability more specifically our goals are 1 to estimate the annual solid yield and its proportion due to flood events 2 to characterize different types of flood events with ec and 3 to identify environmental parameters that influence floods and their solid discharge 2 the case study of the las river located in the south of france on the mediterranean coast fig 1 the las river is a small urban stream 8 km long flowing through the city of toulon 170 000 inhabitants population density of 4000 inhabitants per km2 it is the only river flowing into the little bay the western sub basins of the bay of toulon that shelters the military and civilian harbors the bay of toulon is submitted to intense anthropogenic pressure french navy commercial traffic industry raw sewage where many economic activities nautical and touristic activities mussel and fish farming take place previous studies have shown the high contamination of the bottom sediment of the bay of toulon tessier et al 2011 dang et al 2014 2015 demonstrating the need to understand the hydro sedimentary processes and sources of sediment supply the suspended solid yield to the bay remains the missing link for such processes and represents a gap to fulfill to further understand explain and conserve its coastal system because of its high population density and its strong influence on economic activities the las river is a proper case study location with typical mediterranean climate conditions various uses of the watershed several hydrologic sources and a crucial necessity for water supply 2 1 catchment the area has a typical mediterranean climate with mild winters and dry summers the 30 year interannual rainfall is 640 mm with less than 55 rainy days per year on average toulon weather station météo france 2017 the las river catchment area is dual composed of a groundwater recharge area supplying the karst springs and a surface watershed around its valley jurassic and cretaceous carbonate rocks mainly limestone and dolostone form the geological environment and an extensive karst system covers the surrounding area karst features including sinkholes dolines polje karren and caves favor the concentration of water infiltration and create a very dynamic aquifer with fast and significant variation of flow rate baudement et al 2017 this limestone plateau siou blanc is a large catchment area 70 km2 for groundwater recharge of the dardennes aquifer mainly discharging at the dardennes springs baudement et al 2017 karst springs provide the seasonal varying low flow water discharge in the las river and cause karst floods during rainfall events diversified land use characterize the watershed ranging from natural and former agricultural land upstream to urban areas close to the las valley and the mediterranean sea a large part of the rainfall infiltrates over the karst natural or formal agricultural land and surface runoff is almost nil on the carbonate hills runoff is then roughly limited to the downstream urban area covering an area of 14 km2 and the urban drainage network transports water that converges from hills to the las valley 2 2 karst springs and river morphology two main karst springs are referenced fig 1 the dardennes springs at the upstream location of the las valley 8 km from the sea and the saint antoine spring 3 6 km from the sea the latter s discharge ranges from 0 01 m3 s 1 to 4 m3 s 1 arfib unpublished data 2019 other springs exist with insignificant discharge as the baume de dardennes spring and may be negligible compared to the two previous zones the dardennes springs are of significant importance for the city of toulon since they provide drinking water for more than a century downstream the springs a dam built in 1913 creates a reservoir which provides drinking water during the low flow period maximum stored volume 1 1 106 m3 the reservoir water level hres is controlled and monitored by the drinking water treatment plant and fluctuates from 123 m above sea level m a s l in winter to 110 to 115 m a s l in summer above 123 m the reservoir water overflows by a spillway to the downstream las river for management purpose rarely occurring the opening of flush valves of the dam regulates the reservoir water level dardennes karst springs generate a near bottom current which prevents the settling of sediments in the reservoir and favours a solid discharge to the las river through the water treatment plant the natural discharge of the dardennes springs is close to 0 1 m3 s 1 during the low flow period in summer withdrawn for the freshwater supply during floods karst discharge can exceed 20 m3 s 1 and is closely linked to the rainfall amount over the recharge area baudement et al 2017 a vauclusian overflow spring called ragas spring and located 500 m upstream the reservoir discharges groundwater during flood events when a threshold level at 149 m a s l is exceeded the ragas karst conduit acts as a natural piezometer in the karst network and its level hragas reflects the periods of a possible high contribution of karst groundwater to the las river the las river has a straight channel constrained by the hill slopes surrounding the valley its width is almost constant 10 m large the water height ranges from few centimeters at low flow to two meters in flood and its bed is natural with coarse pebble and gravel the gradient is high 14 per mil in average between the dardennes springs and saint antoine spring the downstream 3 km have been channelized the first 2 km with concrete 3 methodology 3 1 instrumental setup we assessed the solid discharge with climatic datasets and hydrological observations recorded both at the source and the mouth of the las river the location of the monitoring station near the river s mouth was selected accordingly to accessibility and technical constraints square in fig 1 as far downstream as possible the vast majority of tributaries such as possible underground springs stormwater outlet urban runoff were thus taken into account a 2 m high waterfall located 100 m upstream the monitoring station favors a complete mixing of the water column and homogeneous ssc we assumed that recorded data is representative of the entire vertical cross section and consequently of the solid discharge to the sea a multi parameter probe and a sediment trap were deployed continuously for 17 months from october 2012 to march 2014 the multi parameter probe recorded temperature pressure turbidity and electric conductivity data every 5 min the sediment sampler fully described by phillips et al 2000 is designed to trap suspended matter that flows in the stream by slowing down the ambient flow which induces sedimentation by settling its efficiency in trapping a representative time integrated sample of the suspended solid discharge has been showed phillips et al 2000 russell et al 2000 and verified for the las river see appendix a sediment trap samplings were processed with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer that provides size distribution in volume with a sizing range from 0 04 to 2000 µm 155 water samples were also collected punctually at the same station to estimate the ssc and to convert the recorded turbidity data into concentration upstream near the river s sources ctd probes were deployed to characterized the three karst springs ragas dardennes saint antoine at a 15 min time step 3 2 rainfall and water discharge the french meteorological network météo france provided the rainfall data recorded at la mitre weather station diamond in fig 1 this station is located 4 km from our monitoring station close to the sea in the same climatic environment using only one rain gauge we assume that the rainfall is homogeneous over toulon city and the las catchment and so this station is representative of the rainfall over the urban watershed of the las river for further discussion about the rainfall over the karst recharge area out of the scope of this paper several rain gauges must be used to capture the rainfall heterogeneity as done in baudement et al 2017 the las river flow was estimated with a rating curve linked to the water height at the monitoring station square in fig 1 the rating curve was established with 41 discharge measurements carried out with the dilution method by injection of a fluorescent dye schnegg et al 2011 lamarque 2014 between august 2013 and january 2014 during the monitoring period 3 3 data analysis 3 3 1 relationship turbidity suspended solid concentration the ssc is deduced from turbidity data which indicates the water opacity establishing a single relationship between the turbidity data and the ssc for each monitoring station is essential since the suspended matter characteristics e g size mineralogy lenzi marchi 2000 influence the turbidity response and might change depending on the location we established a specific ntu ssc relationship for our monitoring station from the recorded turbidity data and the scc from water samplings filtrations see appendix b 3 3 2 selection of flood events we selected flood events based on the water discharge by using the filtered peaks over threshold fpot method claps laio 2003 all the local maxima of the time series were first selected and filtered step 1 to obtain a sequence of discharge rises relative to the base level preceding the event a second filter was applied to retain only the largest peaks step 2 and to ignore the smallest events and false peaks induced by the noise component of the signal a threshold of 1 m3 s 1 was defined graphically to be higher than the daily noisy discharge variations and to keep a maximum of relevant flood events a lower value would have included a small number of additional short events with a minor impact on the volume of water and the total solid discharge however this threshold is a key factor for flood frequency analysis lang et al 1999 bezak et al 2014 and the time series should be reprocessed for further analysis when several peaks succeed one another within less than 12 h successive floods peaks were merged in one single flood event fig 2 3 3 3 characterizing flood events events based characteristics regarding hydrological features the suspended solid discharge and rainfall for each flood events are summarized in table 1 with their abbreviation and units the duration of selected events is based on the start and the end times the start time is taken when the water discharge started to increase the end of the event is by contrast not trivial and depends on the shape of the recession limb of the hydrograph flood recession hydrographs have been commonly described by a rapid falling limb followed by one or a series of exponential recessions which are characterized by one or several slopes depending on the baseflow variations chow 2010 we adopted a method to include the rapid falling limb and the first baseflow recession time the flood event thus lasts until the inflection point at the end of the first baseflow recession slope fig 2 this method has the advantage to be easily applied and integrates the flood peak and the first part of the delayed recession flow while excluding the effects of a long tailing discharge recession rainfall characterizes the events with the total rainfall during the flood event and rainfall intensities 6 min and 1 h because rainfalls frequently occur before the increase of the water discharge and consequently before the beginning of the selected flood event previous rainfalls are also taken into account antecedent rainfalls parameters relationships among all of these parameters are investigated with a pearson correlation matrix an appropriate analysis to identify factors that might control the measured hydrological and sedimentary responses zabaleta et al 2007 nadal romero et al 2008 3 3 4 sources of water the discharge water of the las river originates from different sources mixed in various proportions we distinguish the two karst groundwater discharge zones dardennes springs and saint antoine spring and the urban runoff of the city of toulon with the water levels in the karst springs and the ec at the monitoring station main karst flood events from dardennes springs are characterized by a disconnection between the water levels from the ragas spring hragas and the dardennes reservoir hres with a peak water level up to the ragas cave threshold 149 m a s l the 123 m a s l threshold of the dardennes reservoir controls the discharge of karst groundwater to the las river rocks of the aquifer and the residence time of groundwater induce different ec representative of the total dissolved solids in the water column ec values act as a signature for different sources of water identified with ctd measurements in karst springs ec of the runoff water in toulon has been measured during rainfall event in road gutter draining stormwater we defined three categories of floodwater sources in the river i an increasing water discharge combined with runoff ec values and an unchanged karst level creates an urban runoff ur flood only due to rainfall ii the groundwater from dardennes karst springs fills the reservoir and only supply the river when overflowing the dam spillway hres 123 m a s l this karst overflow ko creates a sudden rise of the river discharge combined with characteristic ec values of the dardennes springs iii to prevent this massive water discharge managers occasionally open the dam s valves usually during and after a karst flood this management m maintains hres under 123 m a s l and sustains the discharge for a few days slow recession all combinations of sources of water are possible ur and or ko and or m 4 results 4 1 las river hydrological response data is available for 462 days over 522 days of in situ monitoring and shows the highly variable hydrological response of the las river fig 3 the water discharge q shows significant variations ranging from 0 01 to 37 5 m3 s 1 fig 3b the mean discharge qave is about 1 66 m3 s 1 and the total volume of water discharged wtot in 462 days is 74 106 m3 q was higher than qave for 101 days which yield a water volume of 59 106 m3 consequently 80 of the total water volume is discharged to the sea in less than 22 of the time each of the water sources of the las catchment has a specific ec signature and their contributions induce fluctuations of ec within the river fig 3c the ec of the dardennes springs ranges from 440 to 520 μs cm 1 mean 481 μs cm 1 st d 23 μs cm 1 n 49421 and could reach 400 μs cm 1 for heavy rainfall the saint antoine spring has an ec signature of 550 650 μs cm 1 mean 602 μs cm 1 st d 34 μs cm 1 n 50113 runoff low ec value is highly different from the karst groundwater and is within the same range of other urbanized area meriano et al 2011 with a mean around 80 μs cm 1 st d 27 μs cm 1 n 37 during low flow ec in the river is close to 600 μs cm 1 i e with the main contribution from the saint antoine spring downstream from the dam floods globally induce a decrease of ec with fast drop to less than 100 μs cm 1 due to the input of rainstorm and intermediate values 450 500 μs cm 1 from dardennes springs including the ragas spring overflow during the flow recession following a flood ec increases from 450 to 600 μs cm 1 with mixed water from dardennes springs and saint antoine spring the water level in dardennes springs shows the seasonality of the hydrological response of the las river during the warm and dry season june to october rainfalls are scarce and the water level in the karst decreases the water level in the reservoir remains below 123 m and runoff largely contributes to the river s discharge as depicted by low ec values in the river e g september october 2013 as the first autumn rainfalls refill the karst the water levels in dardennes springs and in the reservoir increase with little influence on q contributions of dardennes springs significantly increase once the water level in the reservoir reaches the dam spillway threshold 123 m or when flush valves are opened 4 2 suspended solid discharge 4 2 1 suspended solid concentration in low flow the average ssc is 5 mg l 1 while during floods ssc reaches more than 1000 mg l 1 one may note that this value is out of the manufacturer range up to 1000 ntu matching to 996 mg l 1 with eq b 1 in appendix b values over this threshold might thus be misestimated however these very high ssc values mostly recorded in november 2012 and february 2013 were not due to flood events most of the largest ssc over this period were recorded in low flow and are most likely due to road works fig 3d other high ssc values might be caused by unauthorized discharge or obstruction of the turbidity probe by floating wastes at the end of summer and autumn 2013 despite the high ssc induced by those events the associated solid yield is low regarding q and the total solid yield to the bay the ssc time series from november 2013 to march 2014 end of available data fig 3d shows a more natural evolution with ssc peak related to rainfall events despite the apparent impact of the flood and water discharge on the suspended load no clear relationship links ssc to q fig 4 a and the highest water discharges do not directly lead to the highest suspended loads the ssc is multiplied with q at each time step to deduce the solid flux the solid flux increases during flood events and is usually comprised between 2 and 5 kg s 1 with a maximum value of 14 kg s 1 the typical step shape of the cumulative daily solid discharge plot fig 4b clearly shows the short main discharge periods and the decisive influence of flood events about 1340 103 kg of suspended matters were brought to the sea during the recorded 17 months period including two winters but only one summer to assess the annual discharge we calculated a 365 days moving average which leads to an approximate annual yield of 707 103 kg y 1 s d 108 103 kg approximately 1050 103 kg of suspended solid were yielded when q was exceeding qave 78 of the solid yield is carried in 22 of the time 4 2 2 grain size characterization of the suspended solid discharge grain size analyses were conducted on the 28 samples from the sediment trap to characterize the suspended matter of the las river most loaded samples are from flood season with a highest total dry mass in fall and spring fig 5 shows the proportion of 5 grain size classes 0 04 4 µm 4 20 µm 20 63 µm 63 200 µm 200 2000 µm for the samples with mud d 63 µm 3 classes in blue shades and sand d 63 µm 2 classes in red shades mud composes almost 90 of the total sediment yield table 2 fine silt 4 20 µm shows the biggest proportion with 40 6 on average the smallest clay particles 0 04 4 µm compose a quarter of the sediments collected but also show the greatest variability s d 13 6 some samples stand out with high sand proportions as in march april 2013 september october 2013 and in december 2013 when sand composes almost 30 of the sediment samples fig 5 4 3 flood events characterization based on the methodology described in section 3 we selected 35 flood events table 3 which were characterized with parameters identified in table 1 and sources of water as described in section 3 3 4 selected floods events lasted between 2 3 h and 162 5 h 6 8 days and are characterized by rainfalls ranging from 0 mm to 81 7 mm flood events yielded between 11 5 103 m3 and 5 54 106 m3 of water and between 408 kg and 105 103 kg of suspended solids with sscave between 4 mg l 1 to 408 mg l 1 these events contributed to approximately 47 of the total water discharge and about 69 of the total solid yield summed up these events durations represented 1188 h 49 5 days being 11 of the studied period according to the hydrograph karst water levels and ec we identified 20 ur floods 3 ko floods and 12 floods from mixed sources 9 ur and ko 2 ur and m and 1 ur ko and m we investigated the flood characteristics with a pearson correlation matrix table 4 with regards to the solid yield very significant correlations with an assumption of non correlation p inferior to 0 01 are in bold and significant correlations p 0 05 are underlined the positive and very significant correlation between wtot qmax and soltot shows the influence of the water discharge on the solid discharge similarly the positive and very significant correlations between soltot and both totrain and hragas suggest that higher total rainfalls and higher water levels in the ragas spring increase the solid discharge the floods events characteristics and their impact on the solid discharge are further discussed in the following section 5 discussion small rivers and urban streams play a decisive role on the total solid yield to the marine system our measurements show that a large proportion of the annual solid yield is due to flood events but the relationship between the solid discharge and the water discharge is intricate investigations on main environmental parameters such as ec provide insights on the floodwater source this section discusses the key factors of karst mediterranean rivers that contribute to the solid yield 5 1 mediterranean rivers rainfall discharge relationship overall our data shows a typical mediterranean river with very low water discharge at the basic low flow level and high peaks during flood events while our dataset covers a relatively short period of 17 months our results seem representative and are typical of mediterranean rivers e g rovira et al 2005 bourrin et al 2008 de girolamo et al 2015 discharge variability is similar to wadi rivers dryland streams also called oueds often located in semi arid climates where rainfall events might be highly variable both spatially and temporally cudennec et al 2007 such variable feature triggers runoff flood but in a dual urban and karst environment like the las river largest rainfalls not always produce largest flood the alternating low flow flood hydrological regime of the las river is amplified by the karst with peculiar flood characteristics the hydraulic responses of both karst springs draining the additional karst recharge area and with typical karst fast and slow groundwater flows and the urban watershed runoff of the city of toulon enhance the highly variable discharge when the dardennes karst aquifer and the reservoir levels are low e g during summer and autumn the karst floods are mitigated by natural storage in the saturated and unsaturated zones of the aquifer baudement et al 2017 and by artificial storage in the reservoir mediterranean karst aquifers naturally mitigate the first rainfall events during summer and autumn e g in fontaine de vaucluse spring catchment area 1100 km2 fleury et al 2007b lez spring catchment area 130 km2 fleury et al 2009 jourde et al 2014 or port miou catchment area 400 km2 arfib and charlier 2016 50 mm to more than 100 mm of cumulated rainfall is then needed in autumn to recharge those karst aquifers and activate fast groundwater flow generating springs floods the cumulated rainfall threshold is usually assessed based on the soil and epikarst storage capacity the non saturated zone storage and the water table height increase when the karst aquifer is depleted the regulated karst water storage in the dardennes reservoir then favors the observation of ur floods in the las river by contrast during high water periods the very dynamic response of the aquifer to mediterranean rainfall events generates karst floods in the river once the karst aquifer has been recharged in autumn the groundwater becomes the main source of floodwater ko with floods lasting for days or weeks after the rainfall event in the dardennes case study the dam forces the water level to rise above the spillway which enhances the groundwater level variation this behaviour is yet typical of vauclusian karst aquifer and would be also observed at the dardennes springs in natural conditions since several springs discharge at different levels with the highest the ragas spring overflowing 60 m above the valley the regulated karst water storage in the dardennes reservoir is a specific characteristic of the las river directly impacting its discharge but the effect of karst on floods is not unique and other case study showed that mitigation can be low sezen et al 2019 watlet et al 2020 the highly variable discharge implies that a specific knowledge of mediterranean rivers yield is required to better understand the coastal marine environment and develop management tools flood events largely contribute to annual yields of the las river and our assessment of the solid and liquid discharges is therefore crucial for hydro sedimentary modeling of the bay of toulon dufresne et al 2018 5 2 exploring the relationship between water discharge and solid discharge the relationship between water discharge and suspended solid concentration is intricate although the latter increases during flood events our results suggest the influence of water discharge on the total solid discharge with a positive and very significant correlation between soltot and discharge characteristics wtot qmax however no clear relation between ssc and q is established for the las river as the maximum ssc and the maximum water flow peaks mismatch this lack of relation is yet not surprising since the link between sediment load and water discharge in fluvial environments is often weak and difficult to assess i e tournoud et al 2003 regüés nadal romero 2013 tesi et al 2013 aich et al 2014 the mediterranean climate and the las river catchment might explain this lack of q ssc relationship long dry periods favor sediments retention within the catchment and limit the solid discharge enhancing the solid load during next flood events in the las river the most loaded events with highest sscave often occur following a dry period as highlighted by the significant negative correlation between sscave and anterain14 table 4 little rainfall over the 14 days previous period increases the sscave of a flood event likewise decreasing sscave for several successive events demonstrates the reduction of sediments availability table 3 e g floods 3 4 14 16 previous floods have then probably flushed the sediment stock from the watershed the streambed or the karst a phenomenon of sediment exhaustion might explain the solid load variability as the period of the year influences the suspended solid carried within a flood in mediterranean rivers rovira batalla 2006 characteristics of the las river dual catchment also conceal such relationship between water discharge and solid discharge a single empirical rating curve between ssc and q could hence rarely be defined for mediterranean rivers 5 3 contribution of floodwater sources on solid yield the positive and very significant correlations between water levels hragas and hres and wtot clearly show the influence of the karst water in the las river table 4 the ec data also corroborates the karst water inflows to the river the positive correlations of ecmin with the levels hragas and hres and with previous rainfall events anterain1 anterain7 anterain14 capable of filling the karst aquifer confirm the karst contribution to the river s discharge the highest the levels are the highest the ecmin likely the direct input of rainwater by urban runoff during intense rainfall high maxint6 maxint1h induces lower ecmin negative correlation the more intense the rainfall is the lower the ecmin low ecmin globally characterizes ur events while karst water increases ecmin fig 6 the significant and positive correlation between ecmax and maxint6 is yet more intricate and its interpretation should be handled with care because the maximal ec is usually observed at the beginning of the flood ecmax might actually depicts the water flowing in the river before the event maximal values are then observed for high proportions of water from the saint antoine spring especially at low flow ec data distinguishes the sources of water as karst springs largely contribute to the wtot discharged to the sea by impacting the liquid discharge the source of water also influences the solid yield the relationships between duration totrain wtot and soltot suggest that largest rainfall events lead to longest floods and to largest water and solid discharges those very significant correlations table 4 yet conceal the relative importance of the karst on the solid discharge the very significant and positive correlations between hragas hres wtot and soltot reveal that largest events receive contributions of dardennes springs and that karst floods generate highest total solid discharge conversely urban runoff floods are not responsible for biggest solid yields despite their higher sscave fig 7 while highest ecmax values characterize ur events fig 6 the negative and significant correlation between ecmax and soltot table 4 suggests that ur floods generate minimum solid yield while one may suppose that highly intense rainfall events would increase the solid load like for other mediterranean catchments i e nadal romero et al 2008 estrany et al 2009 no correlation links the rainfall intensities maxint6min maxint1h and solid discharge characteristics sscave sscmax soltot sscmax cannot be attributed to one or the other source of water since both karst and runoff events give a wide range of values large dots in fig 7 ur events thus present more loaded floods highest sscave but their shorter durations induce lower wtot and soltot than karst floods the capacity of karst flood to yield a large amount of suspended solid relies on the regulation of the water discharge from karst springs throughout the year karst aquifers might store a part of the rainfall water and delay its discharge from several days with a characteristic time lag different for each case study although we did not explore this property in this paper the solid discharge from karst flood might also be expanded by supplementary sources of sediments from the streambed and the karst aquifer itself the sediment storage and yield in karst watersheds are poorly documented but act as a potential sediment source to the sea that must be further investigated karst flood may yield a substantial amount of solid discharge and the complex geomorphology and the extreme heterogeneity of karst systems require an interdisciplinary approach bonacci et al 2006 in such a complex karst system exposed to flash flood and under dam regulation the solid discharge is likely to play a decisive role in the erosion and coastline evolution bergillos et al 2016 5 4 particles size variation as small particles exhibit the capacity to transport contaminants the grain size of the suspended matter affects the capacity of a river to discharge contamination to the coastal ocean cohesive sediments with mean diameter 63 µm form 90 of the solid yield of the las river which implies a considerable contamination pathway because of the extended deployment duration of the sediment sampler regarding floods duration weeks vs hours or days a critical analysis of samplings and water sources is intricate due to the combination of several environmental factors some parameters may still provide insights such as the water levels in karst springs karst flood events seem to yield coarser sediment with an increased sand proportion in samples from the wet season e g march november december the positive and significant correlation between hragas and qmax may imply a larger sand proportion in the samples as higher qmax would increase the water s ability to reach the motion threshold for coarser sediments samplings with the highest sand proportions also had a common characteristic as shown in fig 3a b they all include floods following a long period of low flow able to flush sand sediment settled in the las valley or the catchment one abundant source of sand sediment might also be upstream in the dardennes reservoir fed by runoff over the limestone quarry located uphill some results regarding grain size over the november december 2012 and february 2013 periods should yet be interpreted with caution roadwork in the city of toulon created disturbed discharges and induced very turbid water at the monitoring station fig 3 those events likely increased the amount of sediment trapped by the sampler and results are non characteristic of the las river s normal behavior uncertainties due to measurements by grain size analyzer may also lead to an underestimation of the sand proportion with a maximum allowed size of 2000 µm the grain size analyzer could not detect coarser particles the sampler s inlet diameter 4 mm constrains the size of the trapped suspended solids and our study might underestimate the proportion of coarser particles coarser sediments are more likely to be bedload transported and might present a significant proportion of the solid yield for large flood events in streams vericat batalla 2010 bottom vertical sediment traps would then allow to assess the transport by rolling sliding or saltation hopping otherwise an in situ grain size analyzer might improve the characterization of the suspended particles discharged by coastal rivers using such an analyzer would however imply arduous maintenance to avoid measuring drift not to mention the risk of impacts due to large debris and thief vandalism risks in urbanized areas and should thus be considered only for safe monitoring station proportions of grain size classes may not only exhibit events variability but may also evolve within a single flood event a possible suspended solid concentration gradient between the surface and the bottom might also lead to an underestimation of the total solid yield for instance sand proportion increases within a single flood event in the rhone river most likely due to the water discharge the rain intensity and the sediment availability on the watershed antonelli et al 2008 the evolution of the sediment grain size proportion within a flood event is out of the scope of this paper but we foster future work to focus on sediment load variability at the event s scale particle size variability might introduce errors in the ssc estimation due to its influences on the turbidity ssc relationship especially if grain size varies within a flood lenzi marchi 2000 regüés nadal romero 2013 despite our similar relationships for low flow and floods events see appendix b we believe that the influence of grain size variations on turbidity data needs to be further explored 5 5 other sources of solid yield despite a large amount of total solid discharge by rivers to the coastal ocean the particulate matter might end up in the marine system through other processes such as through the air sea interface for instance the annual atmospheric particulate matter deposition might reach 0 2 g m 2 in the french alps 1 g m 2 in central france and 12 g m 2 in corsica goudie middleton 2001 although seldom exceptional saharan dust event might induce considerable mud deposits as one reported by masson et al 2010 in february 2002 when 13 g m 2 deposited around the city of toulon by assuming a homogeneous deposit over the little bay 9 5 km2 this event possibly led to a solid yield of 123 5 tons of mud this amount is more than our biggest total solid yield for one single flood 8th event 27 30 november 2012 and represents about 15 to 20 of the annual solid discharge 710 tons y 1 110 from the las river atmospheric mud deposition might reach the same order of magnitude than the annual solid yield from rivers to the western mediterranean martin et al 1989 and therefore might act as a major process in the sedimentary budget of the ocean or at least of the western mediterranean sea 6 conclusion this study assessed the suspended solid yield of a coastal mediterranean river and its proportion due to flood events with an alternating low flow flood regime the las river provides 69 of solid discharge in 11 of the time which supports the hypothesis that floods events in coastal mediterranean rivers largely contribute to the total solid yield characterization of flood events allowed the identification of environmental parameters generating large solid discharge mostly composed of mud 90 the solid yield depends on the total rainfall and the total water discharge but is also highly related to the groundwater contribution of karst springs comparatively to karst flood runoff induced higher suspended load average ssc but generated a lower total solid yield as our results regarding the solid discharge based on in situ data seems reliable they also highlight the necessity of on site specific calibration of the turbidity probe often laborious challenging and expensive fieldwork and measurements may however become easier by using simple conductivity probes electric conductivity data may accurately describe the floodwater source and provide valuable insights on solid discharges and sediment transport processes karst regions are of substantial interest since they contribute to a considerable amount of drinking water supply across europe and they regulate the water discharge of karst springs throughout the year conclusions of the present study may therefore be extended to several other karst mediterranean watersheds with decisive

sediment sampler the sediment sampler has shown its efficiency to trap representative samples regarding small particles and low flow velocities phillips et al 2000 to ensure the efficiency of the device in the las river fig a 1 shows the dry mass from collected samples and the total solid yield for the deployment period assessed with the turbidity probe the good correlation between the sampled mass and the estimated solid discharge suggests that the device is efficient regarding solid yield however no data allows us to verify the representativeness of the sampler regarding grain size b turbidity ssc relation the ssc is deduced from turbidity data which indicates the water opacity the turbidity unit of measurement the nephelometric turbidity unit ntu depends on probes sensitivity and the suspended matter characteristics parameters such as the size and the mineralogy of particles lenzi marchi 2000 and river s discharge pfannkuche schmidt 2003 may induce high variability of the recorded turbidity data and interfere with the estimation of the ssc since the suspended matter characteristics change depending on location and river it is essential to establish a single

solid discharge of the las river se france a small stream in karst and urban environments and its proportion due to flood events floods characteristics are analyzed to explore the variability of the solid yield and the influence of urban runoff and karst springs discharge based on in situ data the 35 floods events monitored during a 17 months survey largely contributed to the annual yield with a proportion of 47 of the total water and 69 of the total solid yielded in 11 of the time the total rainfall and the total water discharge related to the water levels in karst springs drive the total solid yield mostly composed of mud 90 urban runoff induces higher suspended solid concentration than karst flood but generated a lower total solid yield karst springs by expanding the catchment area of the stream largely contribute to the total volume of water discharged to the sea and enhance the sand proportion due to their influence on the maximal water discharge these results reveal the strong influence of the karst spring hydrodynamic functioning on the sediment yield to mediterranean coastal environments this study also highlights the efficiency of electric conductivity data to provide valuable insights about floodwater sources and sediment transport processes keywords solid discharge flood runoff urban stream karst spring bay of toulon 1 introduction coastal areas are very sensitive zones impacted by many anthropogenic and natural factors where continental activities strongly influence the marine environment through rivers discharges sediments play an essential role in both aquatic and marine environments as they influence nutrients dynamics but also contribute to contaminants transport although essential for bio geochemical activities and responsible for some marine pollution sediment fluxes in small rivers are poorly documented rivers solid discharge thereby represents a substantial environmental issue especially for the coastal marine environment unlike continental climate rivers mediterranean rivers show large discharge variability struglia et al 2004 and solid yields are difficult to predict due to variable rainfall events and rivers temporary character de girolamo et al 2015 a temporal average is barely significant because of the considerable discharge variation between the low flow and flood hydrologic sources include karst springs rainfall events and urban runoff while anthropogenic activities and uses of the watershed primarily impact rivers discharge cudennec et al 2007 one may then be concerned by rivers solid discharge in coastal areas especially in a mediterranean highly touristic and marine based economic region quantification of sediment fluxes is all the more important in the mediterranean region and arid and semi arid areas given that long dry periods and intense rainstorms cause unpredictable flash flood of not only rivers but also temporary streams gaume et al 2009 a single flash flood event may alter the physical characteristics of the seawater column near the river s outlet for several days and its surface water for one month capello et al 2016 small rivers and ephemeral streams are generally un gauged and little studied due to their limited economic impact despite the need to understand their dynamics and processes tzoraki et al 2007 skoulikidis amaxidis 2009 temporary rivers catchments yet represent 30 of the mediterranean region moraetis et al 2010 and their solid discharge might represent a significant proportion of total solid yield for instance nicolau et al 2012 estimated that flood discharge of the eygoutier river southern france catchment 70 km2 was responsible for more than 90 of the annual yield of suspended solids and particulate copper cu zinc zn cadmium cd and lead pb large flood event in the têt river southern france catchment 1400 km2 yielded about half of the annual total load within only a few days bourrin et al 2008 between 1980 and 1999 78 of the total sediment was discharged from the têt river to the gulf of lion western mediterranean within 50 days serrat et al 2001 the solid discharge due to floods events in small coastal mediterranean rivers is expected to contribute significantly to the total solid yield small rivers and urban streams have yet been understudied but their contributions are commonly crucial for the local economy flood risk assessment and management and water supply skoulikidis et al 2017 their solid yields are also essential for the sedimentary budget of the entire marine system triggered by rainfall snowmelt or karst springs flood events characterization usually relies on water discharge several other hydrological parameters and flood characteristics also provide insights on the solid discharge and the total yield the event duration lópez tarazón et al 2010 the highest water discharge during the flood alexandrov et al 2003 zabaleta et al 2007 lópez tarazón et al 2010 lópez tarazón et al 2012 and the total water

ten harkel 1994 alexandrov et al 2007 zabaleta et al 2007 nadal romero et al 2008 lópez tarazón et al 2010 may also impact the solid discharge because the electric conductivity ec acts as a tracer of the source of water and mixing processes it has also been used to characterize flood events e g pilgrim et al 1979 valdes et al 2006 pellerin et al 2008 meriano et al 2011 rainwater coming from evaporation and then condensation has a very low ec around 0 μs cm 1 following contact with surrounding soils runoff may increase stream conductivity robson et al 1993 karst springs also show specific ec that may act as a signature and lead to identify hydrological processes provided that the water ec is sufficiently distinct to distinguish the different contributions to the discharge the flood event characteristics might thus be linked to the water sources runoff or karst with ec data i e robson et al 1992 valdes et al 2006 perrin tournoud 2009 in this study we focus on the las river in southern france a typical small karst and urban mediterranean coastal river carbonate rocks occupy 21 6 of the european land surface chen et al 2017 where they form the dominant coastal rock in the northern part of the mediterranean sea fleury et al 2007a mostly forming karst aquifers their recharge area is usually distinct from the watershed by enlarging the total catchment area of a stream karst aquifers often increase both the water discharge and the sediment reserve karst aquifers also have a peculiar hydrodynamic functioning due to large and permeable conduits related to the speleogenetic history of the carbonate rocks jouves et al 2017 groundwater flows through the karst network and converges to the springs that concentrate the water discharge in few outlets karst springs discharge is then highly variable and can lead to flash flood gaume et al 2009 fleury et al 2013 this paper aims to assess the total solid yield of a small urban river to the mediterranean sea and to explore floods characteristics influencing its solid discharge not only we estimate the annual solid yield but we also analyze hydrological data from 35 events to focus on floods characteristics and to assess the solid discharge variability more specifically our goals are 1 to estimate the annual solid yield and its proportion due to flood events 2 to characterize different types of flood events with ec and 3 to identify environmental parameters that influence floods and their solid discharge 2 the case study of the las river located in the south of france on the mediterranean coast fig 1 the las river is a small urban stream 8 km long flowing through the city of toulon 170 000 inhabitants population density of 4000 inhabitants per km2 it is the only river flowing into the little bay the western sub basins of the bay of toulon that shelters the military and civilian harbors the bay of toulon is submitted to intense anthropogenic pressure french navy commercial traffic industry raw sewage where many economic activities nautical and touristic activities mussel and fish farming take place previous studies have shown the high contamination of the bottom sediment of the bay of toulon tessier et al 2011 dang et al 2014 2015 demonstrating the need to understand the hydro sedimentary processes and sources of sediment supply the suspended solid yield to the bay remains the missing link for such processes and represents a gap to fulfill to further understand explain and conserve its coastal system because of its high population density and its strong influence on economic activities the las river is a proper case study location with typical mediterranean climate conditions various uses of the watershed several hydrologic sources and a crucial necessity for water supply 2 1 catchment the area has a typical mediterranean climate with mild winters and dry summers the 30 year interannual rainfall is 640 mm with less than 55 rainy days per year on average toulon weather station météo france 2017 the las river catchment area is dual composed of a groundwater recharge area supplying the karst springs and a surface watershed around its valley jurassic and cretaceous carbonate rocks mainly limestone and dolostone form the geological environment and an extensive karst system covers the surrounding area karst features including sinkholes dolines polje karren and caves favor the concentration of water infiltration and create a very dynamic aquifer with fast and significant variation of flow rate baudement et al 2017 this limestone plateau siou blanc is a large catchment area 70 km2 for groundwater recharge of the dardennes aquifer mainly discharging at the dardennes springs baudement et al 2017 karst springs provide the seasonal varying low flow water discharge in the las river and cause karst floods during rainfall events diversified land use characterize the watershed ranging from natural and former agricultural land upstream to urban areas close to the las valley and the mediterranean sea a large part of the rainfall infiltrates over the karst natural or formal agricultural land and surface runoff is almost nil on the carbonate hills runoff is then roughly limited to the downstream urban area covering an area of 14 km2 and the urban drainage network transports water that converges from hills to the las valley 2 2 karst springs and river morphology two main karst springs are referenced fig 1 the dardennes springs at the upstream location of the las valley 8 km from the sea and the saint antoine spring 3 6 km from the sea the latter s discharge ranges from 0 01 m3 s 1 to 4 m3 s 1 arfib unpublished data 2019 other springs exist with insignificant discharge as the baume de dardennes spring and may be negligible compared to the two previous zones the dardennes springs are of significant importance for the city of toulon since they provide drinking water for more than a century downstream the springs a dam built in 1913 creates a reservoir which provides drinking water during the low flow period maximum stored volume 1 1 106 m3 the reservoir water level hres is controlled and monitored by the drinking water treatment plant and fluctuates from 123 m above sea level m a s l in winter to 110 to 115 m a s l in summer above 123 m the reservoir water overflows by a spillway to the downstream las river for management purpose rarely occurring the opening of flush valves of the dam regulates the reservoir water level dardennes karst springs generate a near bottom current which prevents the settling of sediments in the reservoir and favours a solid discharge to the las river through the water treatment plant the natural discharge of the dardennes springs is close to 0 1 m3 s 1 during the low flow period in summer withdrawn for the freshwater supply during floods karst discharge can exceed 20 m3 s 1 and is closely linked to the rainfall amount over the recharge area baudement et al 2017 a vauclusian overflow spring called ragas spring and located 500 m upstream the reservoir discharges groundwater during flood events when a threshold level at 149 m a s l is exceeded the ragas karst conduit acts as a natural piezometer in the karst network and its level hragas reflects the periods of a possible high contribution of karst groundwater to the las river the las river has a straight channel constrained by the hill slopes surrounding the valley its width is almost constant 10 m large the water height ranges from few centimeters at low flow to two meters in flood and its bed is natural with coarse pebble and gravel the gradient is high 14 per mil in average between the dardennes springs and saint antoine spring the downstream 3 km have been channelized the first 2 km with concrete 3 methodology 3 1 instrumental setup we assessed the solid discharge with climatic datasets and hydrological observations recorded both at the source and the mouth of the las river the location of the monitoring station near the river s mouth was selected accordingly to accessibility and technical constraints square in fig 1 as far downstream as possible the vast majority of tributaries such as possible underground springs stormwater outlet urban runoff were thus taken into account a 2 m high waterfall located 100 m upstream the monitoring station favors a complete mixing of the water column and homogeneous ssc we assumed that recorded data is representative of the entire vertical cross section and consequently of the solid discharge to the sea a multi parameter probe and a sediment trap were deployed continuously for 17 months from october 2012 to march 2014 the multi parameter probe recorded temperature pressure turbidity and electric conductivity data every 5 min the sediment sampler fully described by phillips et al 2000 is designed to trap suspended matter that flows in the stream by slowing down the ambient flow which induces sedimentation by settling its efficiency in trapping a representative time integrated sample of the suspended solid discharge has been showed phillips et al 2000 russell et al 2000 and verified for the las river see appendix a sediment trap samplings were processed with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer that provides size distribution in volume with a sizing range from 0 04 to 2000 µm 155 water samples were also collected punctually at the same station to estimate the ssc and to convert the recorded turbidity data into concentration upstream near the river s sources ctd probes were deployed to characterized the three karst springs ragas dardennes saint antoine at a 15 min time step 3 2 rainfall and water discharge the french meteorological network météo france provided the rainfall data recorded at la mitre weather station diamond in fig 1 this station is located 4 km from our monitoring station close to the sea in the same climatic environment using only one rain gauge we assume that the rainfall is homogeneous over toulon city and the las catchment and so this station is representative of the rainfall over the urban watershed of the las river for further discussion about the rainfall over the karst recharge area out of the scope of this paper several rain gauges must be used to capture the rainfall heterogeneity as done in baudement et al 2017 the las river flow was estimated with a rating curve linked to the water height at the monitoring station square in fig 1 the rating curve was established with 41 discharge measurements carried out with the dilution method by injection of a fluorescent dye schnegg et al 2011 lamarque 2014 between august 2013 and january 2014 during the monitoring period 3 3 data analysis 3 3 1 relationship turbidity suspended solid concentration the ssc is deduced from turbidity data which indicates the water opacity establishing a single relationship between the turbidity data and the ssc for each monitoring station is essential since the suspended matter characteristics e g size mineralogy lenzi marchi 2000 influence the turbidity response and might change depending on the location we established a specific ntu ssc relationship for our monitoring station from the recorded turbidity data and the scc from water samplings filtrations see appendix b 3 3 2 selection of flood events we selected flood events based on the water discharge by using the filtered peaks over threshold fpot method claps laio 2003 all the local maxima of the time series were first selected and filtered step 1 to obtain a sequence of discharge rises relative to the base level preceding the event a second filter was applied to retain only the largest peaks step 2 and to ignore the smallest events and false peaks induced by the noise component of the signal a threshold of 1 m3 s 1 was defined graphically to be higher than the daily noisy discharge variations and to keep a maximum of relevant flood events a lower value would have included a small number of additional short events with a minor impact on the volume of water and the total solid discharge however this threshold is a key factor for flood frequency analysis lang et al 1999 bezak et al 2014 and the time series should be reprocessed for further analysis when several peaks succeed one another within less than 12 h successive floods peaks were merged in one single flood event fig 2 3 3 3 characterizing flood events events based characteristics regarding hydrological features the suspended solid discharge and rainfall for each flood events are summarized in table 1 with their abbreviation and units the duration of selected events is based on the start and the end times the start time is taken when the water discharge started to increase the end of the event is by contrast not trivial and depends on the shape of the recession limb of the hydrograph flood recession hydrographs have been commonly described by a rapid falling limb followed by one or a series of exponential recessions which are characterized by one or several slopes depending on the baseflow variations chow 2010 we adopted a method to include the rapid falling limb and the first baseflow recession time the flood event thus lasts until the inflection point at the end of the first baseflow recession slope fig 2 this method has the advantage to be easily applied and integrates the flood peak and the first part of the delayed recession flow while excluding the effects of a long tailing discharge recession rainfall characterizes the events with the total rainfall during the flood event and rainfall intensities 6 min and 1 h because rainfalls frequently occur before the increase of the water discharge and consequently before the beginning of the selected flood event previous rainfalls are also taken into account antecedent rainfalls parameters relationships among all of these parameters are investigated with a pearson correlation matrix an appropriate analysis to identify factors that might control the measured hydrological and sedimentary responses zabaleta et al 2007 nadal romero et al 2008 3 3 4 sources of water the discharge water of the las river originates from different sources mixed in various proportions we distinguish the two karst groundwater discharge zones dardennes springs and saint antoine spring and the urban runoff of the city of toulon with the water levels in the karst springs and the ec at the monitoring station main karst flood events from dardennes springs are characterized by a disconnection between the water levels from the ragas spring hragas and the dardennes reservoir hres with a peak water level up to the ragas cave threshold 149 m a s l the 123 m a s l threshold of the dardennes reservoir controls the discharge of karst groundwater to the las river rocks of the aquifer and the residence time of groundwater induce different ec representative of the total dissolved solids in the water column ec values act as a signature for different sources of water identified with ctd measurements in karst springs ec of the runoff water in toulon has been measured during rainfall event in road gutter draining stormwater we defined three categories of floodwater sources in the river i an increasing water discharge combined with runoff ec values and an unchanged karst level creates an urban runoff ur flood only due to rainfall ii the groundwater from dardennes karst springs fills the reservoir and only supply the river when overflowing the dam spillway hres 123 m a s l this karst overflow ko creates a sudden rise of the river discharge combined with characteristic ec values of the dardennes springs iii to prevent this massive water discharge managers occasionally open the dam s valves usually during and after a karst flood this management m maintains hres under 123 m a s l and sustains the discharge for a few days slow recession all combinations of sources of water are possible ur and or ko and or m 4 results 4 1 las river hydrological response data is available for 462 days over 522 days of in situ monitoring and shows the highly variable hydrological response of the las river fig 3 the water discharge q shows significant variations ranging from 0 01 to 37 5 m3 s 1 fig 3b the mean discharge qave is about 1 66 m3 s 1 and the total volume of water discharged wtot in 462 days is 74 106 m3 q was higher than qave for 101 days which yield a water volume of 59 106 m3 consequently 80 of the total water volume is discharged to the sea in less than 22 of the time each of the water sources of the las catchment has a specific ec signature and their contributions induce fluctuations of ec within the river fig 3c the ec of the dardennes springs ranges from 440 to 520 μs cm 1 mean 481 μs cm 1 st d 23 μs cm 1 n 49421 and could reach 400 μs cm 1 for heavy rainfall the saint antoine spring has an ec signature of 550 650 μs cm 1 mean 602 μs cm 1 st d 34 μs cm 1 n 50113 runoff low ec value is highly different from the karst groundwater and is within the same range of other urbanized area meriano et al 2011 with a mean around 80 μs cm 1 st d 27 μs cm 1 n 37 during low flow ec in the river is close to 600 μs cm 1 i e with the main contribution from the saint antoine spring downstream from the dam floods globally induce a decrease of ec with fast drop to less than 100 μs cm 1 due to the input of rainstorm and intermediate values 450 500 μs cm 1 from dardennes springs including the ragas spring overflow during the flow recession following a flood ec increases from 450 to 600 μs cm 1 with mixed water from dardennes springs and saint antoine spring the water level in dardennes springs shows the seasonality of the hydrological response of the las river during the warm and dry season june to october rainfalls are scarce and the water level in the karst decreases the water level in the reservoir remains below 123 m and runoff largely contributes to the river s discharge as depicted by low ec values in the river e g september october 2013 as the first autumn rainfalls refill the karst the water levels in dardennes springs and in the reservoir increase with little influence on q contributions of dardennes springs significantly increase once the water level in the reservoir reaches the dam spillway threshold 123 m or when flush valves are opened 4 2 suspended solid discharge 4 2 1 suspended solid concentration in low flow the average ssc is 5 mg l 1 while during floods ssc reaches more than 1000 mg l 1 one may note that this value is out of the manufacturer range up to 1000 ntu matching to 996 mg l 1 with eq b 1 in appendix b values over this threshold might thus be misestimated however these very high ssc values mostly recorded in november 2012 and february 2013 were not due to flood events most of the largest ssc over this period were recorded in low flow and are most likely due to road works fig 3d other high ssc values might be caused by unauthorized discharge or obstruction of the turbidity probe by floating wastes at the end of summer and autumn 2013 despite the high ssc induced by those events the associated solid yield is low regarding q and the total solid yield to the bay the ssc time series from november 2013 to march 2014 end of available data fig 3d shows a more natural evolution with ssc peak related to rainfall events despite the apparent impact of the flood and water discharge on the suspended load no clear relationship links ssc to q fig 4 a and the highest water discharges do not directly lead to the highest suspended loads the ssc is multiplied with q at each time step to deduce the solid flux the solid flux increases during flood events and is usually comprised between 2 and 5 kg s 1 with a maximum value of 14 kg s 1 the typical step shape of the cumulative daily solid discharge plot fig 4b clearly shows the short main discharge periods and the decisive influence of flood events about 1340 103 kg of suspended matters were brought to the sea during the recorded 17 months period including two winters but only one summer to assess the annual discharge we calculated a 365 days moving average which leads to an approximate annual yield of 707 103 kg y 1 s d 108 103 kg approximately 1050 103 kg of suspended solid were yielded when q was exceeding qave 78 of the solid yield is carried in 22 of the time 4 2 2 grain size characterization of the suspended solid discharge grain size analyses were conducted on the 28 samples from the sediment trap to characterize the suspended matter of the las river most loaded samples are from flood season with a highest total dry mass in fall and spring fig 5 shows the proportion of 5 grain size classes 0 04 4 µm 4 20 µm 20 63 µm 63 200 µm 200 2000 µm for the samples with mud d 63 µm 3 classes in blue shades and sand d 63 µm 2 classes in red shades mud composes almost 90 of the total sediment yield table 2 fine silt 4 20 µm shows the biggest proportion with 40 6 on average the smallest clay particles 0 04 4 µm compose a quarter of the sediments collected but also show the greatest variability s d 13 6 some samples stand out with high sand proportions as in march april 2013 september october 2013 and in december 2013 when sand composes almost 30 of the sediment samples fig 5 4 3 flood events characterization based on the methodology described in section 3 we selected 35 flood events table 3 which were characterized with parameters identified in table 1 and sources of water as described in section 3 3 4 selected floods events lasted between 2 3 h and 162 5 h 6 8 days and are characterized by rainfalls ranging from 0 mm to 81 7 mm flood events yielded between 11 5 103 m3 and 5 54 106 m3 of water and between 408 kg and 105 103 kg of suspended solids with sscave between 4 mg l 1 to 408 mg l 1 these events contributed to approximately 47 of the total water discharge and about 69 of the total solid yield summed up these events durations represented 1188 h 49 5 days being 11 of the studied period according to the hydrograph karst water levels and ec we identified 20 ur floods 3 ko floods and 12 floods from mixed sources 9 ur and ko 2 ur and m and 1 ur ko and m we investigated the flood characteristics with a pearson correlation matrix table 4 with regards to the solid yield very significant correlations with an assumption of non correlation p inferior to 0 01 are in bold and significant correlations p 0 05 are underlined the positive and very significant correlation between wtot qmax and soltot shows the influence of the water discharge on the solid discharge similarly the positive and very significant correlations between soltot and both totrain and hragas suggest that higher total rainfalls and higher water levels in the ragas spring increase the solid discharge the floods events characteristics and their impact on the solid discharge are further discussed in the following section 5 discussion small rivers and urban streams play a decisive role on the total solid yield to the marine system our measurements show that a large proportion of the annual solid yield is due to flood events but the relationship between the solid discharge and the water discharge is intricate investigations on main environmental parameters such as ec provide insights on the floodwater source this section discusses the key factors of karst mediterranean rivers that contribute to the solid yield 5 1 mediterranean rivers rainfall discharge relationship overall our data shows a typical mediterranean river with very low water discharge at the basic low flow level and high peaks during flood events while our dataset covers a relatively short period of 17 months our results seem representative and are typical of mediterranean rivers e g rovira et al 2005 bourrin et al 2008 de girolamo et al 2015 discharge variability is similar to wadi rivers dryland streams also called oueds often located in semi arid climates where rainfall events might be highly variable both spatially and temporally cudennec et al 2007 such variable feature triggers runoff flood but in a dual urban and karst environment like the las river largest rainfalls not always produce largest flood the alternating low flow flood hydrological regime of the las river is amplified by the karst with peculiar flood characteristics the hydraulic responses of both karst springs draining the additional karst recharge area and with typical karst fast and slow groundwater flows and the urban watershed runoff of the city of toulon enhance the highly variable discharge when the dardennes karst aquifer and the reservoir levels are low e g during summer and autumn the karst floods are mitigated by natural storage in the saturated and unsaturated zones of the aquifer baudement et al 2017 and by artificial storage in the reservoir mediterranean karst aquifers naturally mitigate the first rainfall events during summer and autumn e g in fontaine de vaucluse spring catchment area 1100 km2 fleury et al 2007b lez spring catchment area 130 km2 fleury et al 2009 jourde et al 2014 or port miou catchment area 400 km2 arfib and charlier 2016 50 mm to more than 100 mm of cumulated rainfall is then needed in autumn to recharge those karst aquifers and activate fast groundwater flow generating springs floods the cumulated rainfall threshold is usually assessed based on the soil and epikarst storage capacity the non saturated zone storage and the water table height increase when the karst aquifer is depleted the regulated karst water storage in the dardennes reservoir then favors the observation of ur floods in the las river by contrast during high water periods the very dynamic response of the aquifer to mediterranean rainfall events generates karst floods in the river once the karst aquifer has been recharged in autumn the groundwater becomes the main source of floodwater ko with floods lasting for days or weeks after the rainfall event in the dardennes case study the dam forces the water level to rise above the spillway which enhances the groundwater level variation this behaviour is yet typical of vauclusian karst aquifer and would be also observed at the dardennes springs in natural conditions since several springs discharge at different levels with the highest the ragas spring overflowing 60 m above the valley the regulated karst water storage in the dardennes reservoir is a specific characteristic of the las river directly impacting its discharge but the effect of karst on floods is not unique and other case study showed that mitigation can be low sezen et al 2019 watlet et al 2020 the highly variable discharge implies that a specific knowledge of mediterranean rivers yield is required to better understand the coastal marine environment and develop management tools flood events largely contribute to annual yields of the las river and our assessment of the solid and liquid discharges is therefore crucial for hydro sedimentary modeling of the bay of toulon dufresne et al 2018 5 2 exploring the relationship between water discharge and solid discharge the relationship between water discharge and suspended solid concentration is intricate although the latter increases during flood events our results suggest the influence of water discharge on the total solid discharge with a positive and very significant correlation between soltot and discharge characteristics wtot qmax however no clear relation between ssc and q is established for the las river as the maximum ssc and the maximum water flow peaks mismatch this lack of relation is yet not surprising since the link between sediment load and water discharge in fluvial environments is often weak and difficult to assess i e tournoud et al 2003 regüés nadal romero 2013 tesi et al 2013 aich et al 2014 the mediterranean climate and the las river catchment might explain this lack of q ssc relationship long dry periods favor sediments retention within the catchment and limit the solid discharge enhancing the solid load during next flood events in the las river the most loaded events with highest sscave often occur following a dry period as highlighted by the significant negative correlation between sscave and anterain14 table 4 little rainfall over the 14 days previous period increases the sscave of a flood event likewise decreasing sscave for several successive events demonstrates the reduction of sediments availability table 3 e g floods 3 4 14 16 previous floods have then probably flushed the sediment stock from the watershed the streambed or the karst a phenomenon of sediment exhaustion might explain the solid load variability as the period of the year influences the suspended solid carried within a flood in mediterranean rivers rovira batalla 2006 characteristics of the las river dual catchment also conceal such relationship between water discharge and solid discharge a single empirical rating curve between ssc and q could hence rarely be defined for mediterranean rivers 5 3 contribution of floodwater sources on solid yield the positive and very significant correlations between water levels hragas and hres and wtot clearly show the influence of the karst water in the las river table 4 the ec data also corroborates the karst water inflows to the river the positive correlations of ecmin with the levels hragas and hres and with previous rainfall events anterain1 anterain7 anterain14 capable of filling the karst aquifer confirm the karst contribution to the river s discharge the highest the levels are the highest the ecmin likely the direct input of rainwater by urban runoff during intense rainfall high maxint6 maxint1h induces lower ecmin negative correlation the more intense the rainfall is the lower the ecmin low ecmin globally characterizes ur events while karst water increases ecmin fig 6 the significant and positive correlation between ecmax and maxint6 is yet more intricate and its interpretation should be handled with care because the maximal ec is usually observed at the beginning of the flood ecmax might actually depicts the water flowing in the river before the event maximal values are then observed for high proportions of water from the saint antoine spring especially at low flow ec data distinguishes the sources of water as karst springs largely contribute to the wtot discharged to the sea by impacting the liquid discharge the source of water also influences the solid yield the relationships between duration totrain wtot and soltot suggest that largest rainfall events lead to longest floods and to largest water and solid discharges those very significant correlations table 4 yet conceal the relative importance of the karst on the solid discharge the very significant and positive correlations between hragas hres wtot and soltot reveal that largest events receive contributions of dardennes springs and that karst floods generate highest total solid discharge conversely urban runoff floods are not responsible for biggest solid yields despite their higher sscave fig 7 while highest ecmax values characterize ur events fig 6 the negative and significant correlation between ecmax and soltot table 4 suggests that ur floods generate minimum solid yield while one may suppose that highly intense rainfall events would increase the solid load like for other mediterranean catchments i e nadal romero et al 2008 estrany et al 2009 no correlation links the rainfall intensities maxint6min maxint1h and solid discharge characteristics sscave sscmax soltot sscmax cannot be attributed to one or the other source of water since both karst and runoff events give a wide range of values large dots in fig 7 ur events thus present more loaded floods highest sscave but their shorter durations induce lower wtot and soltot than karst floods the capacity of karst flood to yield a large amount of suspended solid relies on the regulation of the water discharge from karst springs throughout the year karst aquifers might store a part of the rainfall water and delay its discharge from several days with a characteristic time lag different for each case study although we did not explore this property in this paper the solid discharge from karst flood might also be expanded by supplementary sources of sediments from the streambed and the karst aquifer itself the sediment storage and yield in karst watersheds are poorly documented but act as a potential sediment source to the sea that must be further investigated karst flood may yield a substantial amount of solid discharge and the complex geomorphology and the extreme heterogeneity of karst systems require an interdisciplinary approach bonacci et al 2006 in such a complex karst system exposed to flash flood and under dam regulation the solid discharge is likely to play a decisive role in the erosion and coastline evolution bergillos et al 2016 5 4 particles size variation as small particles exhibit the capacity to transport contaminants the grain size of the suspended matter affects the capacity of a river to discharge contamination to the coastal ocean cohesive sediments with mean diameter 63 µm form 90 of the solid yield of the las river which implies a considerable contamination pathway because of the extended deployment duration of the sediment sampler regarding floods duration weeks vs hours or days a critical analysis of samplings and water sources is intricate due to the combination of several environmental factors some parameters may still provide insights such as the water levels in karst springs karst flood events seem to yield coarser sediment with an increased sand proportion in samples from the wet season e g march november december the positive and significant correlation between hragas and qmax may imply a larger sand proportion in the samples as higher qmax would increase the water s ability to reach the motion threshold for coarser sediments samplings with the highest sand proportions also had a common characteristic as shown in fig 3a b they all include floods following a long period of low flow able to flush sand sediment settled in the las valley or the catchment one abundant source of sand sediment might also be upstream in the dardennes reservoir fed by runoff over the limestone quarry located uphill some results regarding grain size over the november december 2012 and february 2013 periods should yet be interpreted with caution roadwork in the city of toulon created disturbed discharges and induced very turbid water at the monitoring station fig 3 those events likely increased the amount of sediment trapped by the sampler and results are non characteristic of the las river s normal behavior uncertainties due to measurements by grain size analyzer may also lead to an underestimation of the sand proportion with a maximum allowed size of 2000 µm the grain size analyzer could not detect coarser particles the sampler s inlet diameter 4 mm constrains the size of the trapped suspended solids and our study might underestimate the proportion of coarser particles coarser sediments are more likely to be bedload transported and might present a significant proportion of the solid yield for large flood events in streams vericat batalla 2010 bottom vertical sediment traps would then allow to assess the transport by rolling sliding or saltation hopping otherwise an in situ grain size analyzer might improve the characterization of the suspended particles discharged by coastal rivers using such an analyzer would however imply arduous maintenance to avoid measuring drift not to mention the risk of impacts due to large debris and thief vandalism risks in urbanized areas and should thus be considered only for safe monitoring station proportions of grain size classes may not only exhibit events variability but may also evolve within a single flood event a possible suspended solid concentration gradient between the surface and the bottom might also lead to an underestimation of the total solid yield for instance sand proportion increases within a single flood event in the rhone river most likely due to the water discharge the rain intensity and the sediment availability on the watershed antonelli et al 2008 the evolution of the sediment grain size proportion within a flood event is out of the scope of this paper but we foster future work to focus on sediment load variability at the event s scale particle size variability might introduce errors in the ssc estimation due to its influences on the turbidity ssc relationship especially if grain size varies within a flood lenzi marchi 2000 regüés nadal romero 2013 despite our similar relationships for low flow and floods events see appendix b we believe that the influence of grain size variations on turbidity data needs to be further explored 5 5 other sources of solid yield despite a large amount of total solid discharge by rivers to the coastal ocean the particulate matter might end up in the marine system through other processes such as through the air sea interface for instance the annual atmospheric particulate matter deposition might reach 0 2 g m 2 in the french alps 1 g m 2 in central france and 12 g m 2 in corsica goudie middleton 2001 although seldom exceptional saharan dust event might induce considerable mud deposits as one reported by masson et al 2010 in february 2002 when 13 g m 2 deposited around the city of toulon by assuming a homogeneous deposit over the little bay 9 5 km2 this event possibly led to a solid yield of 123 5 tons of mud this amount is more than our biggest total solid yield for one single flood 8th event 27 30 november 2012 and represents about 15 to 20 of the annual solid discharge 710 tons y 1 110 from the las river atmospheric mud deposition might reach the same order of magnitude than the annual solid yield from rivers to the western mediterranean martin et al 1989 and therefore might act as a major process in the sedimentary budget of the ocean or at least of the western mediterranean sea 6 conclusion this study assessed the suspended solid yield of a coastal mediterranean river and its proportion due to flood events with an alternating low flow flood regime the las river provides 69 of solid discharge in 11 of the time which supports the hypothesis that floods events in coastal mediterranean rivers largely contribute to the total solid yield characterization of flood events allowed the identification of environmental parameters generating large solid discharge mostly composed of mud 90 the solid yield depends on the total rainfall and the total water discharge but is also highly related to the groundwater contribution of karst springs comparatively to karst flood runoff induced higher suspended load average ssc but generated a lower total solid yield as our results regarding the solid discharge based on in situ data seems reliable they also highlight the necessity of on site specific calibration of the turbidity probe often laborious challenging and expensive fieldwork and measurements may however become easier by using simple conductivity probes electric conductivity data may accurately describe the floodwater source and provide valuable insights on solid discharges and sediment transport processes karst regions are of substantial interest since they contribute to a considerable amount of drinking water supply across europe and they regulate the water discharge of karst springs throughout the year conclusions of the present study may therefore be extended to several other karst mediterranean watersheds with decisive

sediment sampler the sediment sampler has shown its efficiency to trap representative samples regarding small particles and low flow velocities phillips et al 2000 to ensure the efficiency of the device in the las river fig a 1 shows the dry mass from collected samples and the total solid yield for the deployment period assessed with the turbidity probe the good correlation between the sampled mass and the estimated solid discharge suggests that the device is efficient regarding solid yield however no data allows us to verify the representativeness of the sampler regarding grain size b turbidity ssc relation the ssc is deduced from turbidity data which indicates the water opacity the turbidity unit of measurement the nephelometric turbidity unit ntu depends on probes sensitivity and the suspended matter characteristics parameters such as the size and the mineralogy of particles lenzi marchi 2000 and river s discharge pfannkuche schmidt 2003 may induce high variability of the

5154,accurate measurements of the overland flow velocity along the flow depth are critical to understanding hydraulic and soil erosion processes on hillslopes however this topic has not been investigated in detail to date this study used a high resolution particle image velocimetry method to capture the flow fields of overland flow on a fixed smooth bed experiments were conducted under eight shallow flow conditions at flow depths ranging from 0 49 to 1 1 10 2 m a fully developed open channel flow condition was the control group the reynolds stress values indicated the presence of two regions namely the inner and outer regions the inner region was affected by viscous stress and reynolds stress whereas the outer region was affected only by reynolds stress the boundary between the two regions was variable whereas the open channel flow had a fixed boundary three subregions were observed in the inner region and two subregions were detected in the outer region the free surface was primarily affected by surface tension which weakened as the flow depth h and the weber number we increased at we 6 the surface tension effect was buffered and no free surface region was observed in the velocity profile our results indicated that the division of the velocity region for overland flow differed from that of the open channel flow and the expressions of the subregions were also different in terms of the empirical constant a and integration constant c overland flow occurred when the dimensionless flow depth h h u ν was less than 550 this study provides an approach to improve the measurement accuracy and theoretical understanding of overland flow processes and hydrodynamic mechanisms on hillslopes keywords overland flow particle image velocimetry piv velocity profile surface tension critical depth 1 introduction soil erosion due to overland flow is a significant ecological and environmental problem worldwide that causes land degradation and extensive contamination of water resources and may adversely affect ecosystem services moreno ramón et al 2014 borrelli et al 2015 li et al 2017 overland flow is defined as a shallow open flow on hillslopes under the action of gravity overland flow is the initial stage of surface runoff and ultimately results in soil erosion li et al 2015 the overland flow velocity is a crucial parameter used to describe the hydrodynamic characteristics of overland flow thus although the measurement of overland flow velocity has been actively researched for decades it remains a significant challenge garcía ruiz et al 2016 in particular the accurate measurement of the overland flow velocity profile represents a particular challenge due to the shallow depth unsteady state and complex boundary conditions li et al 1996 abrantes et al 2018 in addition the most prominent feature of overland flow is the shallow flow depth which can be several millimeters deep however to date the critical flow depth which is the depth distinguishing overland flow from open channel flow has not been clearly defined a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of overland flow velocity can provide new insights into defining the critical depth flow velocity is a crucial hydraulic parameter of overland flow most hydro environmental parameters such as the flow regime stream power shear stress resistance coefficient and soil erosion force require an accurate measurement of flow velocity zhang et al 2010a b ali et al 2012 zhao et al 2016 currently many high precision velocity measurement techniques and equipment e g acoustic doppler velocimetry the acoustic doppler current profiler and the propeller type current meter are unsuitable for measuring overland flow because the probe cannot be submerged at shallow depths three methods are commonly used for measuring overland flow velocity 1 in the flow rate method the flow depth is indirectly measured and the flow velocity is determined using the continuity equation takken and govers 2015 this method is usually used in indoor fixed bed experiments but is unsuitable for erodible beds 2 in the salt tracing method the passage of a salt plume is electronically monitored using a conductivity meter li and abrahams 1997 however the precision is not very high due to the differences in the flow velocities of water and salt especially for salt sediments in laminar flow lei et al 2005 planchon et al 2005 3 the dye tracing method abrahams and atkinson 1993 is straightforward and frequently used in both laboratory and field observations in this method the surface maximum velocity ue can be measured directly although errors may result due to visual interpretation abrantes et al 2018 used an optical video camera to trace the dye in high temperature water that was manually added to the overland flow to minimize the errors however the dye tracing technique is not sufficiently accurate because the mean velocity u is derived by multiplying a correction factor α with the maximum velocity u α ue however α is not a constant and depends on many factors for instance α is positively correlated with the reynolds number re and froude number fr and negatively correlated with the sediment concentration and slope gradient li et al 1996 li and abrahams 1997 ali et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 in summary the dye tracing method is widely used in both laboratory and field measurements but is not sufficiently accurate due to the uncertainties associated with α the aforementioned methods are generally point measuring techniques thus the rich information of multipoint velocity along the flow depth cannot be accurately determined for overland flow li and abrahams 1997 addressed this problem by obtaining the velocity profiles of overland flow using a hot film anemometer it was found that the velocity profiles could be well fitted using logarithmic equations of the form u mlnh c where u is the streamwise velocity along the flow depth h is the height above the bed and m and c are regression coefficients nevertheless the velocity measurements in the region close to the bed were invalid studies on the features of the overland flow velocity profile are limited and we currently lack an in depth understanding of overland flow velocity profiles in contrast extensive theoretical and experimental studies have been performed on velocity profiles of open channel flows which have a deep water depth nezu and rodi 1986 these studies have the potential to improve our understanding of the profile features of overland flow velocity the velocity profiles of open channel flows have rarely been used to describe the spatial distribution of overland flow velocities the most successful description to date of the velocity distribution along the flow depth was provided by nezu and rodi 1986 the authors used a laser doppler anemometer system to obtain accurate measurements of the 2d streamwise and wall normal velocity components in a fully developed open channel flow over a smooth bed a diagram of the streamwise velocity profile of the open channel flow is depicted in fig 1 which is based on the theoretical and experimental results of nezu and rodi 1986 the region influenced dominantly by the reynolds stress is called the outer region whereas the other region influenced by both the reynolds stress and viscous stress is called the inner region according to the velocity features the fluid along the flow depth is classified into five regions the viscous sublayer buffer layer logarithmic law log law region intermediate region and free surface region only the log law and intermediate regions can be described by logarithmic equations near the free surface the streamwise velocity deviates from standard logarithmic equations due to the deceleration of the free surface region which is called the velocity defect law in this study we use a high resolution hr particle image velocimetry piv system to detect the instantaneous velocity field of overland flow with a very shallow flow depth unlike point based measurements piv provides measurements of the transient state of the entire flow field without disturbing the flow as well as an instantaneous velocity field of the fluid westerweel et al 2013 note that in accordance with a previous study nezu and rodi 1986 our experiment was conducted based on the hypothesis that the overland flow velocity profile had ideal boundary conditions i e a smooth bed and no rainfall or wind neither the bed roughness bomminayuni and stoesser 2011 caused by microtopography or soil particles nor the rainfall input was considered the first reason is that these external driving factors would affect the flow velocity and result in an even more complicated velocity structure the second reason is that the boundary conditions in this study are similar to those of previous studies on fully developed open channel flow thereby facilitating the differentiation between overland flow velocity and open channel flow velocity as such the objectives of this study are to 1 determine the velocity profile of overland flow 2 clarify the differences between overland flow velocity and open channel flow velocity and 3 ascertain the critical depth of overland flow which is defined as the depth at which overland flow can be distinguished from open channel flow based on the dimensionless flow depth indoor 2d velocity measurements are conducted to obtain the overland flow velocity moreover for the first time a systematic comparison is performed between the overland flow velocity profile and the open channel flow profile this study has the potential to improve our understanding of hydrodynamic and soil erosion processes on hillslopes 2 materials and methods 2 1 apparatus the experiment was conducted in a recirculating tilting flume located at the mechanism and process of gully erosion laboratory at beijing forestry university the bed and walls of the hydraulic flume consisted of smooth glass with dimensions of 12 m 0 3 m 0 3 m water was pumped from the water tank into the experimental section through a frequency controlled pump whose discharge q was obtained by varying the pump frequency the discharge q was measured using an electromagnetic flowmeter a series of honeycombs was installed at the flume entrance to remove large particles and straighten the flow a tailgate was installed at the flume end to control the water depth six ultrasonic level transmitters installed equidistantly along the flume ensured uniform flow conditions the water temperature was measured using a thermometer with an accuracy of 0 1 c the schematic and dimensions of the apparatus are displayed in fig 2 the measurement area was 7 m from the entrance indicated by a red box in fig 1b to obtain a fully developed uniform flow the instantaneous flow fields of the symmetry plane were measured using hr piv the particle images were captured using a high speed charge coupled device ccd camera 640 480 pixels equipped with a nikon 50 mm f 1 4 lens the images were recorded and stored to obtain the instantaneous and time averaged velocity vectors water was seeded with polyamide sphere tracer particles with a diameter of 10 μm and a density of 1 06 103 kg m3 which were illuminated by a laser light sheet emitted by an 8 w yag laser with a continuous wave the piv resolution used in the open channel flow generally ranges from 15 to 20 pixels mm chen 2014 chen et al 2017 in this study the piv system was improved to match the shallow depth measurements extension tubes were installed between the camera and lens fig 2a to increase the resolution for measuring the shallow flow depth the maximum resolution was 64 pixels mm at this resolution a 0 5 mm thick viscous sublayer was imaged onto 32 pixels i e four points were recorded if the velocity matrix size was 8 pixels second the laser beam was narrowed to strengthen the light intensity which resulted in a clear image a cartesian coordinate system was used in the present study the origin of the coordinate system was located at the left bottom of the measurement area in fig 2b the origin is marked by o the x axis is parallel to the flume bed and is oriented in the flow direction and the y axis is normal to the flume bed and is oriented in the direction of the light sheet accordingly the velocity components in the x and y directions are represented as u and v respectively 2 2 flow conditions before creating the experimental design to ensure overland flow conditions an intensive literature review of overland flow conditions was conducted the results are listed in table 1 previous studies on overland flow have mainly focused on the hydrodynamics of overland flow using either field tests or laboratory simulations such as artificial rainfall and flume scour as presented in table 1 in all studies the flow depth was generally 1 5 10 2 m re varied from 500 to 5000 which indicated that the flow regime belonged to transition flow the criterion was based on the regime classification of open channel flow the froude number fr ranged from 0 5 to 2 which indicated supercritical and subcritical flows the equations of re and fr are listed in the appendix the parameters from previous studies provided a reference for this study nine experimental cases cases c1 c8 and ck control were investigated in the present study the details of the flow conditions and device parameters are listed in table 2 the flow depths of cases c1 c8 were less than 1 1 10 2 m to ensure overland flow the flow depths were greater than 0 49 10 2 m to avoid a rolling wave which would significantly affect the overland flow velocity the re values for cases c1 c8 were between 500 and 5000 which indicated that the flow regime belonged to transitional flow the fr values were smaller than 1 which indicated a subcritical flow state the weber number we represents the ratio of the inertial to surface tension forces a smaller we value indicates higher surface tension force the equation of we is listed in the appendix the case ck was the control group ck was a fully developed turbulent open channel flow re 15915 the case nr was an experiment based on data obtained by nezu and rodi 1986 to verify the accuracy and reliability of the measurements and the algorithm in this study the cases ck and nr can be used to compare a fully developed open channel flow and overland flow in all cases h we and re increased from case c1 to nr whereas there was no distinct rule in fr in this study the aspect ratio of the flume width 0 3 m to flow depth was 5 therefore there was no significant influence of the flume wall on the symmetry plane the flow can be regarded as a quasi 2d steady flow nezu 2005 2 3 algorithm of the hr piv system five thousand pairs of images were captured in each case to obtain a relatively large sample size one pair of images was captured to derive the velocity field as a tracer particle entered the observation zone and the next pair of images was captured to derive another flow field once the tracer particle had left the observation zone these two flow fields were considered independent based on the minimum depth averaged velocity 0 15 m s and the width of the observation zone 0 01 m 30 consecutive images were captured between the first two pairs of images of the independent flow fields thus a total of 150 000 consecutive images were captured for each case and it took 332 s to obtain 5000 pairs of images in this manner the spatiotemporal convergence requirement for the mean flow and turbulence statistics is guaranteed chen et al 2017 yang et al 2019 the particle images were analyzed using a multipass multigrid window deformation algorithm developed at tsinghua university the outliers were removed using a normalized median test and displacement interpolation by the gaussian interpolation formula two gray level correlation matrices from two adjacent frames with maximum autocorrelations were regarded as the same matrix and the velocity was calculated according to the distance between the two matrices this procedure has proven to be valid the details of the algorithm were described by chen 2014 in the present study the window size was 16 16 pixels with a 50 overlap the assessment was performed in three iterative steps thus the final distance between the adjacent velocity matrices was 8 pixels consequently 20 40 measuring points were obtained in the direction of the water depth which guaranteed the density of the measuring points required for hr piv image processing each instantaneous flow field was then filtered using a 3 3 gaussian filter to eliminate the influence of background noise time averaged flow fields were obtained by averaging the velocity components derived from 5000 instantaneous flow fields subsequently the velocity profile was obtained by averaging the velocity components of a horizontal line the water depth was extracted from the images captured by the hr piv system because this method was highly precise one image captured by the hr piv system was randomly selected fig 3 a two lines could be visually identified the water surface at the top and the flume bed surface at the bottom subsequently the time averaged free surface was obtained using digital image processing the procedure for extracting the water surface is described in the following text and consisted of a obtaining a time averaged image of the 5000 frames and b binarizing and extracting the free surface the white line shown in fig 3b represents the free surface extracted using the aforementioned approach where the tracer particles at the surface layer were successfully screened and the free surface was clearly outlined subsequently the water depth h was calculated according to the resolution of the camera as presented in table 2 2 4 theoretical analysis 2 4 1 velocity profile for 2d flow in a smooth bed the equation for the shear stress τ along the flow depth was deduced based on the navier stokes n s equation which is not affected by the flow depth thus the n s equation can be used for the calculation of overland flow the shear stress τ is given as follows 1 τ ρ u v ν u y u 2 1 y h where u v represents the reynolds stress ν u y represents the viscous stress exerted by the flume bed and u is the friction velocity and represents the friction force eq 1 can be transformed to 2 u v u 2 d u u d yu ν 1 ν u h yu ν where u u u y y u ν and r e u h ν thus eq 2 can be simplified as 3 u v u 2 d u d y 1 y re the region near the wall significantly affected by viscous stress is called the inner region where r e y y is small in this region for the inner region eq 3 can be simplified as 4 u v u 2 d u d y 1 we eliminate u v by using prandtl s mixing length theory where 5 u v l 2 d u d y 2 l l u ν we combine eq 5 and eq 4 to obtain the following equation 6 l 2 d u d y 2 d u d y 1 7 d u d y 2 1 1 4 l 2 8 u 0 y 2 1 1 4 l 2 d y the dimensionless mixing length l is modified by van driest s damping function 1956 in the near wall region as follows 9 l κ y 1 e x p y a where κ is the karman constant and a is an empirical constant for fully developed open channel flow the constant a is approximately equal to 26 nezu and rodi 1986 the viscous sublayer is very close to the wall where the effect of viscosity is very high and y approaches 0 thus l also approaches 0 eq 8 can be solved as follows 10 u y outside the viscous sublayer y increases the value of l is considerably higher than 1 thus eq 8 yields 11 u 1 κ ln y c where c is an integration constant eq 11 is a logarithmic equation and has been widely applied in open channel flow the region where the velocity agrees well with the log law is called the log law region which is located in the inner region however no simple expression has been developed for the region between the viscous sublayer and the log law region which is called the buffer layer the velocity of the buffer layer can be directly calculated using eqs 8 and 9 in addition eq 1 can be transformed to 12 u v u 2 ν u h d u u d y h 1 y h 13 u v u 2 r e 1 d u d y h 1 y h r e 1 approaches 0 and thus eq 13 is transformed as follows 14 u v u 2 1 y h from the aforementioned equation the tendency of y h versus u v u 2 is linear in the outer region the outer region is significantly influenced by reynold stress in addition nezu and rodi 1986 suggested that the velocity near the free surface should not be calculated using the standard log law due to velocity defect law vesselina et al 2008 they suggested adding a wake function w as follows 15 u 1 κ ln y c w y h w 2 π κ sin 2 π 2 y h where π is the strength of the wake function the larger the value of π the stronger the influence of the free surface is 2 4 2 friction velocity the variable u is a key parameter for normalizing the velocity and is required for classification at present three methods are commonly used to evaluate u 16 i u ghj where j is the energy slope and j s for uniform flow ii u can also be obtained from the reynolds stress distribution eq 14 the reynolds stress u v can be calculated through time averaged flow fields obtained from hr piv the equation is defined as follows 17 u v 1 n i 1 n u i u v i where ui and vi are instantaneous velocities and u is the streamwise mean velocity n is the count of the flow fields the dimensionless reynolds stress distribution in the outer region is linear in this case u can be solved by combining eqs 14 and 17 the reynolds stress distribution near the free surface obtained from hr piv is adjusted to fit the theoretical curve according to eq 14 by changing the friction velocity u finally the optimal u is found and used in each case iii in general u can be obtained from the log law eq 11 by using the least squares method for a fully developed open channel flow however the region of the log law distribution in overland flow is unknown moreover the constant in the log law may vary for different overland flows thus this method is not considered in the present study 2 5 schematic strategy fig 4 depicts the flowchart of the steps used in the present study first time averaged flow fields are derived from 5000 instantaneous flow fields using the hr piv system and the velocity profile of u is obtained by averaging the velocities on the same horizontal line then the normalized friction velocity u is calculated and optimized with two approaches this process is crucial for deriving the normalized velocity profile theoretical analysis of the open channel flow is performed to obtain the reynolds stress distribution and the inner and outer regions are defined the normalized flow profile of overland flow is divided into different subregions depending on the velocity profile features the partition map of overland flow is then compared with that of the open channel flow finally the dimensionless critical flow depth which is the depth of the boundary between overland flow and open channel flow is calculated by identifying the differences in the velocity profile between overland flow and open channel flow 3 results and discussion 3 1 friction velocity and reynolds stress distribution table 3 shows a comparison of the u values derived from methods i and ii the reynolds number r e based on the u values of the cases is calculated the u value increases with h in our experiment h increases from c1 to ck the deviation decreases with increasing h the deviation of the two methods is less than 10 except for cases c1 and c2 however method i is not considered in this study because this method assumes a parallel surface between the flume bed and the free surface nezu and rodi 1986 thus the values obtained from method ii are used for the subsequent analyses fig 5 depicts the reynolds stress distribution along the flow depth where the black line indicates the theoretical curve y 1 x eq 14 for clarity all the cases are displaced toward the right by 1 0 the reynolds stress distribution follows a linear distribution away from the flume bed in all cases and this region is defined as the outer region the black arrows in the figure denote deviations of the points from the theoretical curve of greater than 2 and indicate the boundary between the inner and outer regions above this point the observed data of the outer region agree well with the black line indicating significant reynolds stress however in the inner region where the fluid is also affected by viscous stress the observed data deviate from the black line fig 5 indicates that the boundaries between the outer and inner regions depend on the flow depth for fully developed open channel flow cases ck and nr the boundary is located at y h 0 2 del álamo et al 2004 chen et al 2017 which indicates that a small portion of the fluid is influenced by viscous stress nevertheless this portion is considerably large for overland flow with a range of 0 2 0 7 and is negatively related to the range of the water depth conversely the portion of the outer region which is significantly affected by reynolds stress increases with increasing h in this study the reason may be the mutual interaction between the reynolds stress and re violent collisions tend to happen between fluid particles at larger re values leading to larger reynolds stress based on the positive correlations between re and h in the study a portion of the outer region increases with increasing h in other words the boundary between the outer and inner region decreases with increasing flow depth h the sub plots in fig 5 are enlargements of cases c1 and c2 near the free surface in this region the points deviate from the theoretical curve which is in contrast to the cases of ck and nr for all cases the lower the flow depth the larger the deviation is this trend is consistent with a decrease in the we values with decreasing flow depth listed in table 2 demonstrating the effect of surface tension on the velocity profile the shallower the water depth the stronger the effect of the surface tension is another distinctive phenomenon is the presence of three sections in the curves for cases c1 to c8 the boundaries between these sections are marked by the black and red arrows the arrows indicate the turning points of the reynolds stress curve from the flume bed to the free surface note that cases ck and nr only have the black arrow below the red arrows the viscous stress is dominant whereas above the black arrows the reynolds stress is dominant in the region between the red and black arrows the viscous stress and reynolds stress are similar therefore three sections can be defined in cases c1 to c8 and only two sections occur in cases ck and nr for overland flow the viscous stress is very high in the region below the red arrow and the depth of this region decreases as h increases the length of the region between the red and black arrows decreases with h in the region above the black arrow the reynolds stress is very high and the reynolds stress distribution is similar to that of the theoretical curve the length of this region increases with h however only two regions exist in a fully developed open channel flow the region with very high viscous stress is inconspicuous because this region is very thin compared with the entire flow depth as a result it is challenging to capture points near the wall region 3 2 velocity profile fig 6 shows the streamwise velocity u profiles of each case along the dimensionless flow depth y h where the black arrow indicates the trend of re the curve of nr is missing because the data were not presented in nezu and rodi s study 1986 the variable u increases with re fig 7 illustrates the dimensionless velocity profile of u versus y for all cases where u u u and y y u ν in this figure the zero axis of u 0 is displaced upward by 5 0 for each case the red and black arrows in fig 7 are identical to those shown in fig 5 furthermore the inner and outer regions of overland flow are further divided by pink arrows and blue arrows respectively the four types of arrows divide the profile into five sub layers from the flume bed to the water surface i e the pink arrow indicates the boundary between the viscous sublayer and buffer layer the red arrow presents the boundary between the buffer layer and log law region the black arrow depicts the boundary between the log law region and intermediate region and the blue arrow denotes the boundary between the intermediate region and free surface region the pink arrow is located at y 10 and the red arrow is located at y 30 the black and blue arrows are not fixed for overland flow in the viscous sublayer located under the pink arrow the relationship between u and y agrees well with eq 10 u y the results verify the accuracy of the measurements and the calculation of u the locations of the sublayer region are within 0 y 10 the viscous stress is dominant in the viscous sublayer region in the buffer layer which is located between the pink and red arrows where 10 y 30 the velocity profile can be estimated directly using eqs 8 and eq 9 however the constant a in eq 9 is unknown under overland flow conditions in the present study a is solved using the least squares method based on experimental measurements further the correlation between a and h dimensionless h h h u ν is calculated fig 8 shows that the a value first increases and then decreases with increasing h subsequently a remains constant at 26 for cases ck and nr when the flow status is a fully developed open channel flow the theoretical curves of the vertical profiles for all cases with the values of a are plotted in fig 7 the results agree well with the experimental data the viscous stress is dominant in the buffer layer for the log law region located between the red and black arrows the velocity profile agrees well with the log law distribution which is described in eq 11 and plotted in fig 7 in the logarithmic equation the karman constant κ remains constant at 0 412 whereas the integration constant c varies with the flow conditions song and graf 1996 sanjou 2006 the constant c can be obtained from eq 11 u 1 κ ln y c by using the least squares method after the velocity curve has been fitted using the observed data table 4 presents the regression coefficient c and coefficient of determination r2 which are 0 95 in all cases this result indicates that the log law applies in this region fig 9 shows the scatter plot of c versus h similar to a c first increases and then decreases with increasing h subsequently c remains constant and approximately equals 5 0 as the flow regime reaches the fully developed case c 4 98 for case ck the viscous stress and reynolds stress are similar in the log law region in the intermediate region which is located between the black arrow and blue arrow u still follows the log law and the reynolds stress is dominant in this region in the free surface region which is located above the blue arrow which is defined as deviating from the log law by more than 2 u does not follow the log law as seen in fig 7 the blue arrow is located roughly at y h 0 6 for case ck which is fully developed open channel flow this result is in agreement with previous studies nezu and rodi 1986 del álamo et al 2004 chen et al 2017 as such the wake function w y h can be applied to quantify the degree of deviation the free surface region can be estimated using eq 15 in this study the strength of the wake function π for each case is obtained using the least squares method and the results are presented in table 5 all of the r2 values are close to 1 demonstrating a near perfect match between the observed data and the results of eq 15 cases ck and nr have larger π values indicating a larger deviation from the log law for a fully developed open channel flow the velocity is damped and the standard log law is invalid near the free surface region nezu and rodi 1986 attributed this deviation to the coherent structure which transports the fluid near the bed to the free surface e g a hairpin vortex therefore the standard log law is invalid near the free surface region the size of an isolated coherent structure ranged from 100 to 450 y in the vertical direction where y u ν zhou et al 1999 the blue arrow is not fixed for overland flow and gradually moves to the free surface from case c1 to c5 while no boundary exists in c6 to c8 the log law can be extended to the free surface in view of the 2 error compared to the theoretical curve the deviation of the overland flow may not be caused by the coherent structure due to the shallow depth maximum y 180 in the present study the coherent structure has not sufficient space to develop fully alternatively the invalidation of the log law may be attributed to surface tension considering that the we values are small and the surface tension cannot be ignored as illustrated in fig 5 the shallower the flow depth the greater the role of surface tension is therefore the log law does not apply in the free surface region fig 10 shows the boundary locations between the intermediate region and free surface region versus the we the results show that the influence of the surface tension decreases with increasing we and there is no significant influence of the surface tension at we 6 fig 11 illustrates the relationship between π and we as well as π and r e in the first stage π decreases with increasing we due to a decrease in the surface tension effects in the second stage π increases with increasing we as h increases we is positively correlated with h the coherent structure buffers the surface tension effect and transports the fluid near the bed to the free surface resulting in an increase in π huffman and bradshaw 1972 observed that π remained constant at 0 2 for re 105 and π 0 for r e 500 however the authors focused on fully developed open channel flow and surface tension was not considered due to the effects of surface tension π can be neglected for r e 500 and we 6 3 3 velocity features of overland flow following the classification method of nezu and rodi 1986 which is displayed in fig 1 a partition map of overland flow is proposed according to our results fig 12 overall the profile can be divided into the inner and outer regions which are similar to those of the partition map of the open channel flow however there are several differences between overland flow and fully developed open channel flow 1 in overland flow the boundary between the inner and outer regions depends on the water depth as shown in fig 5 the depth of the inner region is 0 5 when h 0 6 10 2 m the depth of the inner region decreases as h increases and eventually stabilizes at y h 0 2 for fully developed open channel flow 2 in the inner region three subregions are identified according to the features of the normalized streamwise velocity profile these regions are similar to those of fully developed open channel flow i the first subregion is the viscous sublayer which is located at 0 y 10 and is characterized by u y ii the second subregion is the buffer layer which is located at 10 y 30 its velocity can be estimated using eqs 8 and 9 the empirical constant a first increases and then decreases as h increases and can be considerably larger than 26 in overland flow however in fully developed open channel flow a remains constant at 26 iii the log law region is located above the buffer layer with y 30 however no general equation can be defined due to the uncertainty of the integration constant c which remains constant at 5 29 in fully developed open channel flow in this study the c value of overland flow is larger than 5 29 and first increases and then decreases as h increases a and c are constant for a fully developed open channel flow whereas they are variable for overland flow because a fully developed open channel flow is turbulent flow and the flow parameters are fully developed and remain constant however the overland flow has a transition flow regime in terms of re thus the flow parameters are variable 3 in the outer region there exist two subregions of overland flow i e the intermediate and free surface regions in the intermediate region the velocities follow the log law and the reynolds stress is dominant in the free surface region the velocity deviates from the log law due to the influence of surface tension the case is different for fully developed open channel flow which is caused by the coherent structure the wake function w y h can also be used to quantify the degree of deviation affected by surface tension the π first decreases and then increases as we increases the surface tension effect decreases as we increases at we 6 there is no more surface tension indicating the limited influence exerted by the free surface in this case only the intermediate region exists and the flow over the buffer layer y 30 can be estimated using the logarithmic equations eq 11 for overland flow 3 4 critical depth of overland flow to date no critical depth has been identified to distinguish overland flow from open channel flow consequently there exists no basis for selecting the flow depth in overland flow experiments an investigation of the differences in the velocity profile between overland flow and open channel flow provides new insights for defining the critical flow depth for overland flow the aforementioned results indicate that differences exist in the boundary between the inner and outer regions the a value and the c value between overland flow and fully developed open channel flow specifically these parameters are variable at shallow depths and remain constant when the flow depth is sufficiently deep and overland flow develops into a fully developed open channel flow fig 13 shows the relationship between the aforementioned parameters and the dimensionless flow depth h the boundary locations between the inner and outer regions fig 13a are derived from fig 5 black arrow as h increases a and c increase decrease and ultimately stabilize as overland flow develops into a fully developed open channel flow the data of the declining stage is used to ascertain the critical flow depth as shown in fig 13 the curves in fig 13 are regression curves fitted by the power function the horizontal lines correspond to the constant values for a fully developed open channel flow the intersections of the horizontal line and the curve are considered the critical depths which are marked by vertical lines the critical h values are equal to 550 586 and 600 for the three parameters respectively the three parameters are variable when h 550 and constant when h 600 therefore the dimensionless critical depth h for overland flow is 550 the critical depth proposed in this study is a regression value and additional high accuracy tests are required to verify the critical depth for practical applications the dimensionless critical flow depth is significant for designing an overland flow experiment prior to an overland flow experiment u should be calculated based on the flow conditions using eq 16 equation 17 is not suitable due to the difficulty of obtaining the parameters without piv subsequently h can be obtained by using the flow depth h and the kinematic viscosity ν as such the flow is considered overland flow if h 550 4 conclusions in this study improvements were made to an hr piv system 64 pixels mm to obtain the velocity profile features of overland flow which has not yet been studied in detail hr piv was used for the overland flow velocity measurements to overcome the limitations of single point measurements to determine the velocity characteristics the velocity features were investigated along the flow depth of overland flow on a fixed smooth bed eight overland flow conditions were investigated and a fully developed open channel flow was used as the control group the reynolds stress distribution and time averaged velocity profiles were systematically explored a partition map of overland flow was proposed and was compared with the map of the fully developed open channel flow finally a critical depth of overland flow was proposed according to the discrepancy in the velocity profile between overland flow and open channel flow in addition we defined a critical depth for overland flow two regions were defined in the overland flow velocity profile according to the features of the reynolds stress and normalized velocity profile 1 the inner region was significantly affected by viscous stress and reynold stress and 2 the outer region was significantly affected by the reynolds stress the boundary between the inner and outer regions was variable and the depth of the inner region decreased with increasing flow depth this characteristic was in contrast to the fixed boundary of the fully developed open channel flow in the inner region three subregions were defined according to the velocity features namely 1 a viscous sublayer which was located at 0 y 10 and had a velocity of u y 2 a buffer layer whose velocity was calculated using eqs 8 and 9 and whose dimensionless empirical constant a decreased with increasing flow depth 3 the log law region which agreed with the results of the logarithmic equation and whose integration constant c decreased with increasing flow depth the outer region consisted of an intermediate region and a free surface region the velocities in the intermediate region followed the log law the free surface region was affected by surface tension and the log law did not apply however as we increased the influence of the surface tension weakened and the influence was negligible at we 6 the free surface region did not exist in overland flow in this case the logarithmic equation is applicable to overland flow at y 30 for overland flow the influence of the velocity features and the flow depth on the boundary between the inner and outer regions and the a and c values was investigated a regression was used to determine that the dimensionless critical depth h of overland flow was 550 this study provides detailed insights into the hydrodynamic and soil erosion processes on hillslopes as well as guidance for designing overland flow experiments the present study is a first step in understanding the overland flow velocity features however the flow depths of all cases in our experiments were greater than 0 49 10 2 m to avoid a rolling wave which frequently occurs in overland flow and cannot be neglected in addition surface roughness is a crucial factor in the field thus future studies should investigate the effects of a rolling wave and surface roughness on overland flow velocity credit authorship contribution statement ping ping yang

5154,accurate measurements of the overland flow velocity along the flow depth are critical to understanding hydraulic and soil erosion processes on hillslopes however this topic has not been investigated in detail to date this study used a high resolution particle image velocimetry method to capture the flow fields of overland flow on a fixed smooth bed experiments were conducted under eight shallow flow conditions at flow depths ranging from 0 49 to 1 1 10 2 m a fully developed open channel flow condition was the control group the reynolds stress values indicated the presence of two regions namely the inner and outer regions the inner region was affected by viscous stress and reynolds stress whereas the outer region was affected only by reynolds stress the boundary between the two regions was variable whereas the open channel flow had a fixed boundary three subregions were observed in the inner region and two subregions were detected in the outer region the free surface was primarily affected by surface tension which weakened as the flow depth h and the weber number we increased at we 6 the surface tension effect was buffered and no free surface region was observed in the velocity profile our results indicated that the division of the velocity region for overland flow differed from that of the open channel flow and the expressions of the subregions were also different in terms of the empirical constant a and integration constant c overland flow occurred when the dimensionless flow depth h h u ν was less than 550 this study provides an approach to improve the measurement accuracy and theoretical understanding of overland flow processes and hydrodynamic mechanisms on hillslopes keywords overland flow particle image velocimetry piv velocity profile surface tension critical depth 1 introduction soil erosion due to overland flow is a significant ecological and environmental problem worldwide that causes land degradation and extensive contamination of water resources and may adversely affect ecosystem services moreno ramón et al 2014 borrelli et al 2015 li et al 2017 overland flow is defined as a shallow open flow on hillslopes under the action of gravity overland flow is the initial stage of surface runoff and ultimately results in soil erosion li et al 2015 the overland flow velocity is a crucial parameter used to describe the hydrodynamic characteristics of overland flow thus although the measurement of overland flow velocity has been actively researched for decades it remains a significant challenge garcía ruiz et al 2016 in particular the accurate measurement of the overland flow velocity profile represents a particular challenge due to the shallow depth unsteady state and complex boundary conditions li et al 1996 abrantes et al 2018 in addition the most prominent feature of overland flow is the shallow flow depth which can be several millimeters deep however to date the critical flow depth which is the depth distinguishing overland flow from open channel flow has not been clearly defined a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of overland flow velocity can provide new insights into defining the critical depth flow velocity is a crucial hydraulic parameter of overland flow most hydro environmental parameters such as the flow regime stream power shear stress resistance coefficient and soil erosion force require an accurate measurement of flow velocity zhang et al 2010a b ali et al 2012 zhao et al 2016 currently many high precision velocity measurement techniques and equipment e g acoustic doppler velocimetry the acoustic doppler current profiler and the propeller type current meter are unsuitable for measuring overland flow because the probe cannot be submerged at shallow depths three methods are commonly used for measuring overland flow velocity 1 in the flow rate method the flow depth is indirectly measured and the flow velocity is determined using the continuity equation takken and govers 2015 this method is usually used in indoor fixed bed experiments but is unsuitable for erodible beds 2 in the salt tracing method the passage of a salt plume is electronically monitored using a conductivity meter li and abrahams 1997 however the precision is not very high due to the differences in the flow velocities of water and salt especially for salt sediments in laminar flow lei et al 2005 planchon et al 2005 3 the dye tracing method abrahams and atkinson 1993 is straightforward and frequently used in both laboratory and field observations in this method the surface maximum velocity ue can be measured directly although errors may result due to visual interpretation abrantes et al 2018 used an optical video camera to trace the dye in high temperature water that was manually added to the overland flow to minimize the errors however the dye tracing technique is not sufficiently accurate because the mean velocity u is derived by multiplying a correction factor α with the maximum velocity u α ue however α is not a constant and depends on many factors for instance α is positively correlated with the reynolds number re and froude number fr and negatively correlated with the sediment concentration and slope gradient li et al 1996 li and abrahams 1997 ali et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 in summary the dye tracing method is widely used in both laboratory and field measurements but is not sufficiently accurate due to the uncertainties associated with α the aforementioned methods are generally point measuring techniques thus the rich information of multipoint velocity along the flow depth cannot be accurately determined for overland flow li and abrahams 1997 addressed this problem by obtaining the velocity profiles of overland flow using a hot film anemometer it was found that the velocity profiles could be well fitted using logarithmic equations of the form u mlnh c where u is the streamwise velocity along the flow depth h is the height above the bed and m and c are regression coefficients nevertheless the velocity measurements in the region close to the bed were invalid studies on the features of the overland flow velocity profile are limited and we currently lack an in depth understanding of overland flow velocity profiles in contrast extensive theoretical and experimental studies have been performed on velocity profiles of open channel flows which have a deep water depth nezu and rodi 1986 these studies have the potential to improve our understanding of the profile features of overland flow velocity the velocity profiles of open channel flows have rarely been used to describe the spatial distribution of overland flow velocities the most successful description to date of the velocity distribution along the flow depth was provided by nezu and rodi 1986 the authors used a laser doppler anemometer system to obtain accurate measurements of the 2d streamwise and wall normal velocity components in a fully developed open channel flow over a smooth bed a diagram of the streamwise velocity profile of the open channel flow is depicted in fig 1 which is based on the theoretical and experimental results of nezu and rodi 1986 the region influenced dominantly by the reynolds stress is called the outer region whereas the other region influenced by both the reynolds stress and viscous stress is called the inner region according to the velocity features the fluid along the flow depth is classified into five regions the viscous sublayer buffer layer logarithmic law log law region intermediate region and free surface region only the log law and intermediate regions can be described by logarithmic equations near the free surface the streamwise velocity deviates from standard logarithmic equations due to the deceleration of the free surface region which is called the velocity defect law in this study we use a high resolution hr particle image velocimetry piv system to detect the instantaneous velocity field of overland flow with a very shallow flow depth unlike point based measurements piv provides measurements of the transient state of the entire flow field without disturbing the flow as well as an instantaneous velocity field of the fluid westerweel et al 2013 note that in accordance with a previous study nezu and rodi 1986 our experiment was conducted based on the hypothesis that the overland flow velocity profile had ideal boundary conditions i e a smooth bed and no rainfall or wind neither the bed roughness bomminayuni and stoesser 2011 caused by microtopography or soil particles nor the rainfall input was considered the first reason is that these external driving factors would affect the flow velocity and result in an even more complicated velocity structure the second reason is that the boundary conditions in this study are similar to those of previous studies on fully developed open channel flow thereby facilitating the differentiation between overland flow velocity and open channel flow velocity as such the objectives of this study are to 1 determine the velocity profile of overland flow 2 clarify the differences between overland flow velocity and open channel flow velocity and 3 ascertain the critical depth of overland flow which is defined as the depth at which overland flow can be distinguished from open channel flow based on the dimensionless flow depth indoor 2d velocity measurements are conducted to obtain the overland flow velocity moreover for the first time a systematic comparison is performed between the overland flow velocity profile and the open channel flow profile this study has the potential to improve our understanding of hydrodynamic and soil erosion processes on hillslopes 2 materials and methods 2 1 apparatus the experiment was conducted in a recirculating tilting flume located at the mechanism and process of gully erosion laboratory at beijing forestry university the bed and walls of the hydraulic flume consisted of smooth glass with dimensions of 12 m 0 3 m 0 3 m water was pumped from the water tank into the experimental section through a frequency controlled pump whose discharge q was obtained by varying the pump frequency the discharge q was measured using an electromagnetic flowmeter a series of honeycombs was installed at the flume entrance to remove large particles and straighten the flow a tailgate was installed at the flume end to control the water depth six ultrasonic level transmitters installed equidistantly along the flume ensured uniform flow conditions the water temperature was measured using a thermometer with an accuracy of 0 1 c the schematic and dimensions of the apparatus are displayed in fig 2 the measurement area was 7 m from the entrance indicated by a red box in fig 1b to obtain a fully developed uniform flow the instantaneous flow fields of the symmetry plane were measured using hr piv the particle images were captured using a high speed charge coupled device ccd camera 640 480 pixels equipped with a nikon 50 mm f 1 4 lens the images were recorded and stored to obtain the instantaneous and time averaged velocity vectors water was seeded with polyamide sphere tracer particles with a diameter of 10 μm and a density of 1 06 103 kg m3 which were illuminated by a laser light sheet emitted by an 8 w yag laser with a continuous wave the piv resolution used in the open channel flow generally ranges from 15 to 20 pixels mm chen 2014 chen et al 2017 in this study the piv system was improved to match the shallow depth measurements extension tubes were installed between the camera and lens fig 2a to increase the resolution for measuring the shallow flow depth the maximum resolution was 64 pixels mm at this resolution a 0 5 mm thick viscous sublayer was imaged onto 32 pixels i e four points were recorded if the velocity matrix size was 8 pixels second the laser beam was narrowed to strengthen the light intensity which resulted in a clear image a cartesian coordinate system was used in the present study the origin of the coordinate system was located at the left bottom of the measurement area in fig 2b the origin is marked by o the x axis is parallel to the flume bed and is oriented in the flow direction and the y axis is normal to the flume bed and is oriented in the direction of the light sheet accordingly the velocity components in the x and y directions are represented as u and v respectively 2 2 flow conditions before creating the experimental design to ensure overland flow conditions an intensive literature review of overland flow conditions was conducted the results are listed in table 1 previous studies on overland flow have mainly focused on the hydrodynamics of overland flow using either field tests or laboratory simulations such as artificial rainfall and flume scour as presented in table 1 in all studies the flow depth was generally 1 5 10 2 m re varied from 500 to 5000 which indicated that the flow regime belonged to transition flow the criterion was based on the regime classification of open channel flow the froude number fr ranged from 0 5 to 2 which indicated supercritical and subcritical flows the equations of re and fr are listed in the appendix the parameters from previous studies provided a reference for this study nine experimental cases cases c1 c8 and ck control were investigated in the present study the details of the flow conditions and device parameters are listed in table 2 the flow depths of cases c1 c8 were less than 1 1 10 2 m to ensure overland flow the flow depths were greater than 0 49 10 2 m to avoid a rolling wave which would significantly affect the overland flow velocity the re values for cases c1 c8 were between 500 and 5000 which indicated that the flow regime belonged to transitional flow the fr values were smaller than 1 which indicated a subcritical flow state the weber number we represents the ratio of the inertial to surface tension forces a smaller we value indicates higher surface tension force the equation of we is listed in the appendix the case ck was the control group ck was a fully developed turbulent open channel flow re 15915 the case nr was an experiment based on data obtained by nezu and rodi 1986 to verify the accuracy and reliability of the measurements and the algorithm in this study the cases ck and nr can be used to compare a fully developed open channel flow and overland flow in all cases h we and re increased from case c1 to nr whereas there was no distinct rule in fr in this study the aspect ratio of the flume width 0 3 m to flow depth was 5 therefore there was no significant influence of the flume wall on the symmetry plane the flow can be regarded as a quasi 2d steady flow nezu 2005 2 3 algorithm of the hr piv system five thousand pairs of images were captured in each case to obtain a relatively large sample size one pair of images was captured to derive the velocity field as a tracer particle entered the observation zone and the next pair of images was captured to derive another flow field once the tracer particle had left the observation zone these two flow fields were considered independent based on the minimum depth averaged velocity 0 15 m s and the width of the observation zone 0 01 m 30 consecutive images were captured between the first two pairs of images of the independent flow fields thus a total of 150 000 consecutive images were captured for each case and it took 332 s to obtain 5000 pairs of images in this manner the spatiotemporal convergence requirement for the mean flow and turbulence statistics is guaranteed chen et al 2017 yang et al 2019 the particle images were analyzed using a multipass multigrid window deformation algorithm developed at tsinghua university the outliers were removed using a normalized median test and displacement interpolation by the gaussian interpolation formula two gray level correlation matrices from two adjacent frames with maximum autocorrelations were regarded as the same matrix and the velocity was calculated according to the distance between the two matrices this procedure has proven to be valid the details of the algorithm were described by chen 2014 in the present study the window size was 16 16 pixels with a 50 overlap the assessment was performed in three iterative steps thus the final distance between the adjacent velocity matrices was 8 pixels consequently 20 40 measuring points were obtained in the direction of the water depth which guaranteed the density of the measuring points required for hr piv image processing each instantaneous flow field was then filtered using a 3 3 gaussian filter to eliminate the influence of background noise time averaged flow fields were obtained by averaging the velocity components derived from 5000 instantaneous flow fields subsequently the velocity profile was obtained by averaging the velocity components of a horizontal line the water depth was extracted from the images captured by the hr piv system because this method was highly precise one image captured by the hr piv system was randomly selected fig 3 a two lines could be visually identified the water surface at the top and the flume bed surface at the bottom subsequently the time averaged free surface was obtained using digital image processing the procedure for extracting the water surface is described in the following text and consisted of a obtaining a time averaged image of the 5000 frames and b binarizing and extracting the free surface the white line shown in fig 3b represents the free surface extracted using the aforementioned approach where the tracer particles at the surface layer were successfully screened and the free surface was clearly outlined subsequently the water depth h was calculated according to the resolution of the camera as presented in table 2 2 4 theoretical analysis 2 4 1 velocity profile for 2d flow in a smooth bed the equation for the shear stress τ along the flow depth was deduced based on the navier stokes n s equation which is not affected by the flow depth thus the n s equation can be used for the calculation of overland flow the shear stress τ is given as follows 1 τ ρ u v ν u y u 2 1 y h where u v represents the reynolds stress ν u y represents the viscous stress exerted by the flume bed and u is the friction velocity and represents the friction force eq 1 can be transformed to 2 u v u 2 d u u d yu ν 1 ν u h yu ν where u u u y y u ν and r e u h ν thus eq 2 can be simplified as 3 u v u 2 d u d y 1 y re the region near the wall significantly affected by viscous stress is called the inner region where r e y y is small in this region for the inner region eq 3 can be simplified as 4 u v u 2 d u d y 1 we eliminate u v by using prandtl s mixing length theory where 5 u v l 2 d u d y 2 l l u ν we combine eq 5 and eq 4 to obtain the following equation 6 l 2 d u d y 2 d u d y 1 7 d u d y 2 1 1 4 l 2 8 u 0 y 2 1 1 4 l 2 d y the dimensionless mixing length l is modified by van driest s damping function 1956 in the near wall region as follows 9 l κ y 1 e x p y a where κ is the karman constant and a is an empirical constant for fully developed open channel flow the constant a is approximately equal to 26 nezu and rodi 1986 the viscous sublayer is very close to the wall where the effect of viscosity is very high and y approaches 0 thus l also approaches 0 eq 8 can be solved as follows 10 u y outside the viscous sublayer y increases the value of l is considerably higher than 1 thus eq 8 yields 11 u 1 κ ln y c where c is an integration constant eq 11 is a logarithmic equation and has been widely applied in open channel flow the region where the velocity agrees well with the log law is called the log law region which is located in the inner region however no simple expression has been developed for the region between the viscous sublayer and the log law region which is called the buffer layer the velocity of the buffer layer can be directly calculated using eqs 8 and 9 in addition eq 1 can be transformed to 12 u v u 2 ν u h d u u d y h 1 y h 13 u v u 2 r e 1 d u d y h 1 y h r e 1 approaches 0 and thus eq 13 is transformed as follows 14 u v u 2 1 y h from the aforementioned equation the tendency of y h versus u v u 2 is linear in the outer region the outer region is significantly influenced by reynold stress in addition nezu and rodi 1986 suggested that the velocity near the free surface should not be calculated using the standard log law due to velocity defect law vesselina et al 2008 they suggested adding a wake function w as follows 15 u 1 κ ln y c w y h w 2 π κ sin 2 π 2 y h where π is the strength of the wake function the larger the value of π the stronger the influence of the free surface is 2 4 2 friction velocity the variable u is a key parameter for normalizing the velocity and is required for classification at present three methods are commonly used to evaluate u 16 i u ghj where j is the energy slope and j s for uniform flow ii u can also be obtained from the reynolds stress distribution eq 14 the reynolds stress u v can be calculated through time averaged flow fields obtained from hr piv the equation is defined as follows 17 u v 1 n i 1 n u i u v i where ui and vi are instantaneous velocities and u is the streamwise mean velocity n is the count of the flow fields the dimensionless reynolds stress distribution in the outer region is linear in this case u can be solved by combining eqs 14 and 17 the reynolds stress distribution near the free surface obtained from hr piv is adjusted to fit the theoretical curve according to eq 14 by changing the friction velocity u finally the optimal u is found and used in each case iii in general u can be obtained from the log law eq 11 by using the least squares method for a fully developed open channel flow however the region of the log law distribution in overland flow is unknown moreover the constant in the log law may vary for different overland flows thus this method is not considered in the present study 2 5 schematic strategy fig 4 depicts the flowchart of the steps used in the present study first time averaged flow fields are derived from 5000 instantaneous flow fields using the hr piv system and the velocity profile of u is obtained by averaging the velocities on the same horizontal line then the normalized friction velocity u is calculated and optimized with two approaches this process is crucial for deriving the normalized velocity profile theoretical analysis of the open channel flow is performed to obtain the reynolds stress distribution and the inner and outer regions are defined the normalized flow profile of overland flow is divided into different subregions depending on the velocity profile features the partition map of overland flow is then compared with that of the open channel flow finally the dimensionless critical flow depth which is the depth of the boundary between overland flow and open channel flow is calculated by identifying the differences in the velocity profile between overland flow and open channel flow 3 results and discussion 3 1 friction velocity and reynolds stress distribution table 3 shows a comparison of the u values derived from methods i and ii the reynolds number r e based on the u values of the cases is calculated the u value increases with h in our experiment h increases from c1 to ck the deviation decreases with increasing h the deviation of the two methods is less than 10 except for cases c1 and c2 however method i is not considered in this study because this method assumes a parallel surface between the flume bed and the free surface nezu and rodi 1986 thus the values obtained from method ii are used for the subsequent analyses fig 5 depicts the reynolds stress distribution along the flow depth where the black line indicates the theoretical curve y 1 x eq 14 for clarity all the cases are displaced toward the right by 1 0 the reynolds stress distribution follows a linear distribution away from the flume bed in all cases and this region is defined as the outer region the black arrows in the figure denote deviations of the points from the theoretical curve of greater than 2 and indicate the boundary between the inner and outer regions above this point the observed data of the outer region agree well with the black line indicating significant reynolds stress however in the inner region where the fluid is also affected by viscous stress the observed data deviate from the black line fig 5 indicates that the boundaries between the outer and inner regions depend on the flow depth for fully developed open channel flow cases ck and nr the boundary is located at y h 0 2 del álamo et al 2004 chen et al 2017 which indicates that a small portion of the fluid is influenced by viscous stress nevertheless this portion is considerably large for overland flow with a range of 0 2 0 7 and is negatively related to the range of the water depth conversely the portion of the outer region which is significantly affected by reynolds stress increases with increasing h in this study the reason may be the mutual interaction between the reynolds stress and re violent collisions tend to happen between fluid particles at larger re values leading to larger reynolds stress based on the positive correlations between re and h in the study a portion of the outer region increases with increasing h in other words the boundary between the outer and inner region decreases with increasing flow depth h the sub plots in fig 5 are enlargements of cases c1 and c2 near the free surface in this region the points deviate from the theoretical curve which is in contrast to the cases of ck and nr for all cases the lower the flow depth the larger the deviation is this trend is consistent with a decrease in the we values with decreasing flow depth listed in table 2 demonstrating the effect of surface tension on the velocity profile the shallower the water depth the stronger the effect of the surface tension is another distinctive phenomenon is the presence of three sections in the curves for cases c1 to c8 the boundaries between these sections are marked by the black and red arrows the arrows indicate the turning points of the reynolds stress curve from the flume bed to the free surface note that cases ck and nr only have the black arrow below the red arrows the viscous stress is dominant whereas above the black arrows the reynolds stress is dominant in the region between the red and black arrows the viscous stress and reynolds stress are similar therefore three sections can be defined in cases c1 to c8 and only two sections occur in cases ck and nr for overland flow the viscous stress is very high in the region below the red arrow and the depth of this region decreases as h increases the length of the region between the red and black arrows decreases with h in the region above the black arrow the reynolds stress is very high and the reynolds stress distribution is similar to that of the theoretical curve the length of this region increases with h however only two regions exist in a fully developed open channel flow the region with very high viscous stress is inconspicuous because this region is very thin compared with the entire flow depth as a result it is challenging to capture points near the wall region 3 2 velocity profile fig 6 shows the streamwise velocity u profiles of each case along the dimensionless flow depth y h where the black arrow indicates the trend of re the curve of nr is missing because the data were not presented in nezu and rodi s study 1986 the variable u increases with re fig 7 illustrates the dimensionless velocity profile of u versus y for all cases where u u u and y y u ν in this figure the zero axis of u 0 is displaced upward by 5 0 for each case the red and black arrows in fig 7 are identical to those shown in fig 5 furthermore the inner and outer regions of overland flow are further divided by pink arrows and blue arrows respectively the four types of arrows divide the profile into five sub layers from the flume bed to the water surface i e the pink arrow indicates the boundary between the viscous sublayer and buffer layer the red arrow presents the boundary between the buffer layer and log law region the black arrow depicts the boundary between the log law region and intermediate region and the blue arrow denotes the boundary between the intermediate region and free surface region the pink arrow is located at y 10 and the red arrow is located at y 30 the black and blue arrows are not fixed for overland flow in the viscous sublayer located under the pink arrow the relationship between u and y agrees well with eq 10 u y the results verify the accuracy of the measurements and the calculation of u the locations of the sublayer region are within 0 y 10 the viscous stress is dominant in the viscous sublayer region in the buffer layer which is located between the pink and red arrows where 10 y 30 the velocity profile can be estimated directly using eqs 8 and eq 9 however the constant a in eq 9 is unknown under overland flow conditions in the present study a is solved using the least squares method based on experimental measurements further the correlation between a and h dimensionless h h h u ν is calculated fig 8 shows that the a value first increases and then decreases with increasing h subsequently a remains constant at 26 for cases ck and nr when the flow status is a fully developed open channel flow the theoretical curves of the vertical profiles for all cases with the values of a are plotted in fig 7 the results agree well with the experimental data the viscous stress is dominant in the buffer layer for the log law region located between the red and black arrows the velocity profile agrees well with the log law distribution which is described in eq 11 and plotted in fig 7 in the logarithmic equation the karman constant κ remains constant at 0 412 whereas the integration constant c varies with the flow conditions song and graf 1996 sanjou 2006 the constant c can be obtained from eq 11 u 1 κ ln y c by using the least squares method after the velocity curve has been fitted using the observed data table 4 presents the regression coefficient c and coefficient of determination r2 which are 0 95 in all cases this result indicates that the log law applies in this region fig 9 shows the scatter plot of c versus h similar to a c first increases and then decreases with increasing h subsequently c remains constant and approximately equals 5 0 as the flow regime reaches the fully developed case c 4 98 for case ck the viscous stress and reynolds stress are similar in the log law region in the intermediate region which is located between the black arrow and blue arrow u still follows the log law and the reynolds stress is dominant in this region in the free surface region which is located above the blue arrow which is defined as deviating from the log law by more than 2 u does not follow the log law as seen in fig 7 the blue arrow is located roughly at y h 0 6 for case ck which is fully developed open channel flow this result is in agreement with previous studies nezu and rodi 1986 del álamo et al 2004 chen et al 2017 as such the wake function w y h can be applied to quantify the degree of deviation the free surface region can be estimated using eq 15 in this study the strength of the wake function π for each case is obtained using the least squares method and the results are presented in table 5 all of the r2 values are close to 1 demonstrating a near perfect match between the observed data and the results of eq 15 cases ck and nr have larger π values indicating a larger deviation from the log law for a fully developed open channel flow the velocity is damped and the standard log law is invalid near the free surface region nezu and rodi 1986 attributed this deviation to the coherent structure which transports the fluid near the bed to the free surface e g a hairpin vortex therefore the standard log law is invalid near the free surface region the size of an isolated coherent structure ranged from 100 to 450 y in the vertical direction where y u ν zhou et al 1999 the blue arrow is not fixed for overland flow and gradually moves to the free surface from case c1 to c5 while no boundary exists in c6 to c8 the log law can be extended to the free surface in view of the 2 error compared to the theoretical curve the deviation of the overland flow may not be caused by the coherent structure due to the shallow depth maximum y 180 in the present study the coherent structure has not sufficient space to develop fully alternatively the invalidation of the log law may be attributed to surface tension considering that the we values are small and the surface tension cannot be ignored as illustrated in fig 5 the shallower the flow depth the greater the role of surface tension is therefore the log law does not apply in the free surface region fig 10 shows the boundary locations between the intermediate region and free surface region versus the we the results show that the influence of the surface tension decreases with increasing we and there is no significant influence of the surface tension at we 6 fig 11 illustrates the relationship between π and we as well as π and r e in the first stage π decreases with increasing we due to a decrease in the surface tension effects in the second stage π increases with increasing we as h increases we is positively correlated with h the coherent structure buffers the surface tension effect and transports the fluid near the bed to the free surface resulting in an increase in π huffman and bradshaw 1972 observed that π remained constant at 0 2 for re 105 and π 0 for r e 500 however the authors focused on fully developed open channel flow and surface tension was not considered due to the effects of surface tension π can be neglected for r e 500 and we 6 3 3 velocity features of overland flow following the classification method of nezu and rodi 1986 which is displayed in fig 1 a partition map of overland flow is proposed according to our results fig 12 overall the profile can be divided into the inner and outer regions which are similar to those of the partition map of the open channel flow however there are several differences between overland flow and fully developed open channel flow 1 in overland flow the boundary between the inner and outer regions depends on the water depth as shown in fig 5 the depth of the inner region is 0 5 when h 0 6 10 2 m the depth of the inner region decreases as h increases and eventually stabilizes at y h 0 2 for fully developed open channel flow 2 in the inner region three subregions are identified according to the features of the normalized streamwise velocity profile these regions are similar to those of fully developed open channel flow i the first subregion is the viscous sublayer which is located at 0 y 10 and is characterized by u y ii the second subregion is the buffer layer which is located at 10 y 30 its velocity can be estimated using eqs 8 and 9 the empirical constant a first increases and then decreases as h increases and can be considerably larger than 26 in overland flow however in fully developed open channel flow a remains constant at 26 iii the log law region is located above the buffer layer with y 30 however no general equation can be defined due to the uncertainty of the integration constant c which remains constant at 5 29 in fully developed open channel flow in this study the c value of overland flow is larger than 5 29 and first increases and then decreases as h increases a and c are constant for a fully developed open channel flow whereas they are variable for overland flow because a fully developed open channel flow is turbulent flow and the flow parameters are fully developed and remain constant however the overland flow has a transition flow regime in terms of re thus the flow parameters are variable 3 in the outer region there exist two subregions of overland flow i e the intermediate and free surface regions in the intermediate region the velocities follow the log law and the reynolds stress is dominant in the free surface region the velocity deviates from the log law due to the influence of surface tension the case is different for fully developed open channel flow which is caused by the coherent structure the wake function w y h can also be used to quantify the degree of deviation affected by surface tension the π first decreases and then increases as we increases the surface tension effect decreases as we increases at we 6 there is no more surface tension indicating the limited influence exerted by the free surface in this case only the intermediate region exists and the flow over the buffer layer y 30 can be estimated using the logarithmic equations eq 11 for overland flow 3 4 critical depth of overland flow to date no critical depth has been identified to distinguish overland flow from open channel flow consequently there exists no basis for selecting the flow depth in overland flow experiments an investigation of the differences in the velocity profile between overland flow and open channel flow provides new insights for defining the critical flow depth for overland flow the aforementioned results indicate that differences exist in the boundary between the inner and outer regions the a value and the c value between overland flow and fully developed open channel flow specifically these parameters are variable at shallow depths and remain constant when the flow depth is sufficiently deep and overland flow develops into a fully developed open channel flow fig 13 shows the relationship between the aforementioned parameters and the dimensionless flow depth h the boundary locations between the inner and outer regions fig 13a are derived from fig 5 black arrow as h increases a and c increase decrease and ultimately stabilize as overland flow develops into a fully developed open channel flow the data of the declining stage is used to ascertain the critical flow depth as shown in fig 13 the curves in fig 13 are regression curves fitted by the power function the horizontal lines correspond to the constant values for a fully developed open channel flow the intersections of the horizontal line and the curve are considered the critical depths which are marked by vertical lines the critical h values are equal to 550 586 and 600 for the three parameters respectively the three parameters are variable when h 550 and constant when h 600 therefore the dimensionless critical depth h for overland flow is 550 the critical depth proposed in this study is a regression value and additional high accuracy tests are required to verify the critical depth for practical applications the dimensionless critical flow depth is significant for designing an overland flow experiment prior to an overland flow experiment u should be calculated based on the flow conditions using eq 16 equation 17 is not suitable due to the difficulty of obtaining the parameters without piv subsequently h can be obtained by using the flow depth h and the kinematic viscosity ν as such the flow is considered overland flow if h 550 4 conclusions in this study improvements were made to an hr piv system 64 pixels mm to obtain the velocity profile features of overland flow which has not yet been studied in detail hr piv was used for the overland flow velocity measurements to overcome the limitations of single point measurements to determine the velocity characteristics the velocity features were investigated along the flow depth of overland flow on a fixed smooth bed eight overland flow conditions were investigated and a fully developed open channel flow was used as the control group the reynolds stress distribution and time averaged velocity profiles were systematically explored a partition map of overland flow was proposed and was compared with the map of the fully developed open channel flow finally a critical depth of overland flow was proposed according to the discrepancy in the velocity profile between overland flow and open channel flow in addition we defined a critical depth for overland flow two regions were defined in the overland flow velocity profile according to the features of the reynolds stress and normalized velocity profile 1 the inner region was significantly affected by viscous stress and reynold stress and 2 the outer region was significantly affected by the reynolds stress the boundary between the inner and outer regions was variable and the depth of the inner region decreased with increasing flow depth this characteristic was in contrast to the fixed boundary of the fully developed open channel flow in the inner region three subregions were defined according to the velocity features namely 1 a viscous sublayer which was located at 0 y 10 and had a velocity of u y 2 a buffer layer whose velocity was calculated using eqs 8 and 9 and whose dimensionless empirical constant a decreased with increasing flow depth 3 the log law region which agreed with the results of the logarithmic equation and whose integration constant c decreased with increasing flow depth the outer region consisted of an intermediate region and a free surface region the velocities in the intermediate region followed the log law the free surface region was affected by surface tension and the log law did not apply however as we increased the influence of the surface tension weakened and the influence was negligible at we 6 the free surface region did not exist in overland flow in this case the logarithmic equation is applicable to overland flow at y 30 for overland flow the influence of the velocity features and the flow depth on the boundary between the inner and outer regions and the a and c values was investigated a regression was used to determine that the dimensionless critical depth h of overland flow was 550 this study provides detailed insights into the hydrodynamic and soil erosion processes on hillslopes as well as guidance for designing overland flow experiments the present study is a first step in understanding the overland flow velocity features however the flow depths of all cases in our experiments were greater than 0 49 10 2 m to avoid a rolling wave which frequently occurs in overland flow and cannot be neglected in addition surface roughness is a crucial factor in the field thus future studies should investigate the effects of a rolling wave and surface roughness on overland flow velocity credit authorship contribution statement ping ping yang
