17390,taste and odor t o are an important issue in drinking water aquaculture recreation and a few other associated industries and cyanobacteria relevant geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib are the two most commonly detected t o compounds worldwide a rise in the cyanobacterial blooms and associated geosmin 2 mib episodes due to anthropogenic activities as well as climate change has led to global concerns for drinking water quality the increasing awareness for the safe drinking aquaculture or recreational water systems has boost the demand for rapid robust on site early detection and monitoring system for cyanobacterial geosmin 2 mib events in past years research has indicated quantitative pcr qpcr as one of the promising tools for detection of geosmin 2 mib episodes it offers advantages of detecting the source organism even at very low concentrations distinction of odor producing cyanobacterial strains from non producers and evaluation of odor producing potential of the cyanobacteria at much faster rates compared to conventional techniques the present review aims at examining the current status of developed qpcr primers and probes in identifying and detecting the cyanobacterial blooms along with geosmin 2 mib events among the more than 100 articles about cyanobacteria associated geosmin 2 mib in drinking water systems published after 1990 limited reports approx 10 each for geosmin and 2 mib focused on qpcr detection and its application in the field based on the review of literature a comprehensive open access global cyanobacterial geosmin 2 mib events database cyanogm explorer is curated it acts as a single platform to access updated information related to origin and geographical distribution of geosmin 2 mib events cyanobacterial producers frequency and techniques associated with the monitoring of the events although a total of 132 cyanobacterial strains from 21 genera and 72 cyanobacterial strains from 13 genera have been reported for geosmin and 2 mib production respectively only 58 geosmin and 28 2 mib synthesis regions have been assembled in the ncbi database based on the identity geosmin sequences were found to be more diverse in the geosmin synthase conserved primer design region compared to 2 mib synthesis region hindering the design of universal primers probes emerging technologies such as the bioelectronic nose surface enhanced raman scattering sers and nanopore sequencing are discussed for future applications in early on site detection of geosmin 2 mib and producers in the end the paper also highlights various challenges in applying qpcr as a universal system of monitoring and development of response system for geosmin 2 mib episodes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biomolecular drinking water database geo mic monitoring taq man probes 1 introduction cyanobacteria are ubiquitous and a primary part of the food webs in freshwater ecosystems paerl et al 2001 nevertheless eutrophication and pollution of freshwater results in a drastic increase in the cyanobacterial biomass causing the blooms lee et al 2017 the blooms have a considerable economic impact based on drinking water quality and safety aquacultures productivity and recreational water body activities bruchet 2019 the cyanobacterial blooms are the prime cause for deteriorating water quality by causing hypoxia and anoxia of bottom waters toxin production food web alterations fish kills and foul taste and odor t o events paerl et al 2001 blooms of certain cyanobacteria produce potent neurotoxins anatoxin and saxitoxin and hepatotoxins microcystin cylindrospermopsin and nodularin posing severe health hazards chiu et al 2017 2016 lee et al 2017 other volatile organic compounds produced by cyanobacteria such as sulfur compounds carotenoid derivatives fatty acid derivatives amines and terpenoids are associated with offensive taste and odor issues in the water bruchet 2019 the t o events have implications for the aesthetics integrity and safety of drinking as well as recreational water hence gaining considerable attention of researchers among the various odorants identified geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib responsible for musty or earthy odor are widely studied bruchet 2019 lee et al 2017 watson et al 2016 over the years numerous cases involving the two odorants have been reported in north america australia europe china japan taiwan philippines and south africa su et al 2015 as depicted in fig 1 both geosmin and 2 mib have very low odor threshold value 10 ng l and it is difficult to remove effectively using conventional water treatment processes lu et al 2019 tsao et al 2014 furthermore lack of any clear pattern between the geosmin 2 mib production and endogenous factors associated with cyanobacteria as well as exogenous environmental factors light temperature nutrient supply and dissolved oxygen makes it challenging to monitor and predict t o events effectively watson et al 2016 challenges posed by geosmin 2 mib events worldwide have led to an escalation in the scientific enquiry as evident from fig 2 into its origin abiotic factors detection treatment and management bruchet 2019 over last three decades there is gradual increase in the reports of geosmin and 2 mib in drinking water fig 2 and most of them have been associated with the cyanobacterial blooms john et al 2018 continuous advancements in analytical chemistry have led to the development of ultrasensitive separation detection identification methods for geosmin 2 mib bruchet 2019 lee et al 2017 the taxonomic advancements lu et al 2019 and increase in geosmin 2 mib reports has led to identification of large numbers of geosmin table s1 as well as 2 mib producing bacteria table s2 in the literature hence the current monitoring and control approaches for t o events employ a combination of taxonomic classification with various analytical instruments the time associated with the entire approach is quite long one to several days beginning from the collection of samples transportation and storage laboratory analysis and reporting lu et al 2019 the long turn over time prohibits source water managers and or water utilities to rapidly adopt appropriate control measures if the t o compounds are present in the source water hence there is an increasing demand for the rapid robust sensitive on line monitoring and early detection system for the t o events advances in the genomic technologies and discovery of biosynthetic pathways for geosmin 2 mib have lured the researchers towards the development of biomolecular approaches for early detection of the t o events john et al 2018 lee et al 2017 lu et al 2019 lukassen et al 2019a b wang et al 2019 the present review focuses on shedding light on the biomolecular techniques current as well as emerging technologies for geosmin and 2 mib detection in water systems based on the review of literature an open access database is developed to provide updated information on the occurrence and monitoring techniques for global geosmin 2 mib events this review attempts to provide a detailed analysis of the quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr as a promising tool for early on site detection of geosmin 2 mib along with current status of available primers to detect all the geo and mib sequences in ncbi database furthermore emerging technologies such as the bioelectronic nose surface enhanced raman scattering sers and nanopore sequencing are examined with a potential application in early on site detection of geosmin 2 mib and or their producers in the end the paper highlights the various challenges of qpcr based detection for geosmin 2 mib producing cyanobacteria 2 geosmin and 2 mib events occurrences in the globe the present review indicated that there is lack of single platform providing access to updated information on the origin and geographical distribution of geosmin 2 mib events cyanobacterial producers frequency and techniques associated with the monitoring of the events search based on the various keywords related to geosmin 2 mib using existing search engines is often time consuming and tiring further the researchers are prone to miss certain less important frequent events based on the keywords used during the search process hence keeping all the above issues a comprehensive up to date database cyanogm explorer https cyanogmexp ncku edu tw on cyanobacterial geosmin 2 mib events occurred globally is curated as a part of the present paper the key feature of the database is an interactive user friendly map comprising of up to date cyanobacterial geosmin and 2 mib events across the globe the locations of events can be accessed for additional information like sampling year the technique used for the detection of geosmin 2 mib and publication year along with the reference paper another essential feature of the database is the ability of researchers to update the map with new geosmin 2 mib events after registration and authentication of the users it will provide researchers to highlight the work on the global platform and future directions to geosmin 2 mib detection and monitoring the present map provides valuable information regarding the geographical distribution of the geosmin 2 mib events it can be inferred that there is a higher incidence of geosmin events in the united states of america canada and australia whereas 2 mib events in china taiwan and south korea the difference in geographical distribution suggests that the algal community and the environmental conditions govern the incidence and frequency of t o events furthermore the higher rate of geosmin 2 mib events in certain countries might also represent active monitoring and reporting of the events on the global platform compared to the countries with no low incidence in a nutshell cyanogm explorer can be an effective tool for predicting and providing future directions to the detection and monitoring of the geosmin 2 mib events it can be a possible platform for the researchers working with geosmin 2 mib to interact collaborate and share their research ideas in the community 3 biomolecular methods for detection of geosmin and 2 mib producers biomolecular methods like polymerase chain reaction pcr and quantitative pcr qpcr are developed after the discovery of genes involved in the geosmin and 2 mib biosynthetic pathways cane and watt 2003 dickschat et al 2007 giglio et al 2011a 2008 gust et al 2003 komatsu et al 2008 wang and cane 2008 the exploration of the origin diversity and evolution of these genes in cyanobacteria as well as other bacteria is leading to the continuous improvements of the methods in the recent years wang et al 2019 these techniques have gained considerable interests due to their specificity ability to identify the source of the problem detecting low cell numbers and handling multiple samples in a single run these advantages give them an edge to be used for rapid onsite monitoring of t o events inexpensively chiu et al 2017 2016 john et al 2018 lee et al 2017 lu et al 2019 pcr protocols are extensively developed for both geosmin and 2 mib targeting the biosynthetic genes pcr targeting geosmin synthase gene have been developed for cyanobacteria genera such as nostoc anabaena geitlerinema aphanizomenon lyngbya phormidium and oscillatoria genera giglio et al 2008 kutovaya and watson 2014 su et al 2013 suurnäkki et al 2015 2 mib gene detection by pcr protocol is limited to cyanobacteria genera anabaena oscillatoria planktothrix pseudoanabaena and phormidium giglio et al 2011a suurnäkki et al 2015 wang et al 2011 however none of these developed primers targets all the geosmin and 2 mib producing cyanobacteria multiple primers pairs with different amplification protocols are required for routine monitoring john et al 2018 and hence there is a need to develop the universal targeting primers john et al 2018 developed a novel small amplicon pcr primer able to distinguish all geosmin producing cyanobacteria using a single protocol no such universal pcr primers have been reported for 2 mib producing cyanobacteria another major drawback of pcr is its inability to quantify the amplified products even though various end point analysis can be used for quantification factors such as pcr inhibitors pyrophosphate accumulation or reagent limitation can make it unreliable moore 2019 without the quantification of the amplified dna it is challenging to develop pcr based monitoring systems for the geosmin and 2 mib events hence the simplest and best alternative to this drawback is the development of quantitative pcr qpcr protocols which is discussed in detail in the following sections 3 1 primers for detection of geosmin producers the genes and biosynthetic pathway involved in geosmin synthesis are elucidated in recent years for both actinomycetes as well as cyanobacteria jüttner and watson 2007 fig 3 a geosmin production involves cyclization of universal c15 sesquiterpene precursor i e farnesyl diphosphate to geosmin by enzyme geosmin synthase the gene encoding geosmin synthase in streptomyces was identified independently by gust et al 2003 and cane and watt 2003 using pcr targeted gene replacement and amplification respectively jüttner and watson 2007 two putative genes geoa1 and geoa2 were first cloned from cyanobacteria phormidium sp by ludwig et al 2007 using degenerated pcr primers designed from the conserved region of geo in streptomyces later giglio et al 2008 identified complete geosmin synthase geo in nostoc punctiforme the geosmin synthase gene geo is the main target for the development of qpcr primers specific to cyanobacteria table 1 the qpcr methods yet developed either focused on quantification of geosmin producing bacteria or species composition analysis of geosmin producing cyanobacteria in different environments wang et al 2019 giglio et al 2008 reported the first geosmin synthase based qpcr for its application as a reliable diagnostic tool for cyanobacterial geosmin producers su et al 2013 designed the highly specific sybr green based qpcr assay gsg for detection of geosmin producing anabaena sp with a limit of detection lod of 0 02 pg dna and limit of quantification loq of 0 2 pg dna table 1 the method is capable of detecting the low concentration of anabaena geo 40 copy number in natural water samples it is also possible to track down all the anabaena blooming stages among other dominating algal species su et al 2013 the protocol when combined with arg primers developed in the same study provided quantification of the source as well as the odor producing potential of the cyanobacteria su et al 2013 tsao et al 2014 developed both sybr green based as well as taqman qpcr specific to the quantification of geosmin producing anabaena circinalis the method could successfully distinguish between non geosmin and geosmin producing anabaena sp both the primers 3139f 3245r and sgf1 jdr1 has a detection limit of 101 105 copies ml anabaena specific qpcr are also developed by other researchers with a better limit of detections and their applications in different geographical locations davis 2019 otten et al 2016 the geoa expression was evaluated in both benthic and planktonic cyanobacteria using degenerate cyanobacterial geosmin synthase primers geo cya543f and geo cya728r kutovaya and watson 2014 the primers could successfully identify the geosmin synthase for a wide range of geosmin producing cyanobacteria anabaena planktonica a ucrainica a lemmermanni a flos aquae a variabilis aphanizomenon gracile colothrix sp geitlerinema splendida lyngbya wollei phormidium and planktothrix in both laboratory cultures and natural samples however the qpcr protocol was focused on the expression study of the gene under various environmental conditions rather than exact quantification of the odor producing potential of these cyanobacteria moore 2019 developed taqman qpcr primers geo1f geo1r for identifying and distinguishing geosmin and non geosmin producing nostoc sp with a lod as low as 6 10 4 ng μl equivalent to 3 91 106 copies μl koltsidou 2019 designed qpcr primers cyn geo s5f cyn geo s5r for geosmin synthase gene in cyanobacteria but the primers have low amplification efficiency and suggested that might be due to the lower primer template kinetics of the degenerate primers 3 2 field application of developed qpcr primers for geosmin producing cyanobacteria field studies involving developed primers were demonstrated by multiple researchers in various geographical locations to validate the applicability of qpcr over conventional methods table 2 su et al 2013 quantified geosmin synthase gene gsg of spiked anabaena for a total of 63 field samples from 7 different water sources distributed over five districts of beijing china the gsg copy number significantly correlated coefficient of determination r2 0 68 with the geosmin concentrations of water samples measured using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis the study recommended the use of gsg qpcr as a predictive tool for geosmin events however higher variation was observed for gsg copy number and geosmin concentrations in samples with high dna concentration or cell density use of simple extraction method with lower efficiency such as microwave extraction rather than commercial dna extraction kits can be the potential solution to reduce the variation su et al 2013 tsao et al 2014 evaluated two sets of primers 3139f 3245r and sgf1 jdr1 specific to anabaena circinalis for myponga reservoir south australia table 2 both the primers indicated a significant correlation r2 0 79 between the geosmin gene copy number and microscopic cell density the gene copy number also depicted high correlation r2 0 87 and 0 78 for 3139f 3245r and sgf1 jdr1 respectively to the geosmin concentration measured by gc ms which is higher than the correlation reported by su et al 2013 it was the first field study for the rapid monitoring of geosmin production during a natural cyanobacterial bloom in a drinking water reservoir the taqman primer sgf1 jdr1 because of its higher specificity was used for evaluating geosmin producers in a recirculating aquaculture system for rearing rainbow trout lindholm lehto et al 2019 gaget et al 2020 used the sgf1 jdr1 for benthic cyanobacteria producing geosmin in sa l2 reservoir south australia a low correlation between the gene copy number and geosmin concentration suggested that benthic cyanobacteria contribute to a small portion of geosmin detected in water samples it was also observed that the geosmin synthase could be detected by qpcr only when geosmin concentration is above the loq of 4 ng l for the water samples collected at different seasons the geosmin concentration was between lod and loq values thus affecting the accuracy of the qpcr protocol and resulting in low correlation gaget et al 2020 qpcr primers geo cya543f geo cya728r was used to study the diversity of geosmin producing cyanobacteria in water samples from the great lakes including lakes erie michigan and ontario north america kutovaya and watson 2014 and leslie harrison dam reservoir little nerang and wyaralong of queensland australia jørgensen et al 2016 however kutovaya and watson 2014 did not study the correlation between geosmin concentration and the organism specific geosmin production rate as well as the abundance of geoa possessing cyanobacteria jørgensen et al 2016 did not get cyanobacterial geosmin synthase amplification and predicted the reason to be either low cell count or the non matching primers the authors reflected the possibility of genetic variability of geoa gene in geosmin producers in different geographical locations jørgensen et al 2016 ludwig et al 2007 highlighting the importance of diversity studies of cyanobacterial geosmin producers otten et al 2016 applied qpcr for geosmin producing anabaena in cheney reservoir kansas usa a strong positive correlation r2 0 71 was obtained between the geosmin concentration and anabaena geosmin synthase gene copies indicating anabaena as the principal producer organism during the study period the study suggested that the dna based methods compared to reverse transcriptase pcr rt pcr are simple and appropriate for routine analysis of drinking water samples otten et al 2016 moore et al 2019 using the taqman qpcr primers probes geo1f geo1r designed by the group to detect trace level of nostoc sp in the deer creek samples utah usa interestingly the nostoc sp was not identified by the conventional taxonomy methods in any of the analyzed samples the possible difference in results is either due to the low number of the cells or different sampling time for the studies the study indicates that the inexpensive and fast qpcr coupled with frequent sampling can be applied to study cyanobacterial population community dynamics in the reservoir throughout the year the major problem with the study was the inability of the qpcr probe to identify the cyanobacterial genera much more common to the deer creek reservoir than nostoc sp koltsidou et al 2019 designed the cyanobacterial geosmin qpcr primers cyn geo s5f cyn geo s5r and applied it for detection of geosmin in eagle creek reservoir indianapolis usa even the developed degenerate primers could not detect all the geosmin producers in the creek water samples hence it suggests the development of more comprehensive primers and probes for the broad application of qpcr to all the geosmin producing cyanobacteria also the correlation between geoa genes and the geosmin concentration in eagle creek samples varied among all the sampling sites r2 0 40 to 0 81 with a strong correlation for only 2 of the sampling sites koltsidou et al 2019 the variation might be due to the production rate of geosmin by organisms gene copy numbers and the growth phase of the producers chiu et al 2016 koltsidou 2019 another possibility for low correlation could be the underestimation of geoa genes quantities due to the ability of designed primers to detect only a few cyanobacterial geosmin producers 3 3 primers for detection of 2 mib producers apart from geosmin 2 mib is another major terpenoid responsible for t o problem in drinking water even at low concentrations watson et al 2016 more than 40 species of cyanobacteria including the genera of pseudoanabaena planktothrix planktothricoides phormidium oscillatoria and lyngbya have been reported as 2 mib producers chiu et al 2016 the biosynthetic pathway and genes involved in 2 mib production were first elucidated in actinomycetes dickschat et al 2007 komatsu et al 2008 wang and cane 2008 and later in cyanobacteria giglio et al 2011a wang et al 2011 2 mib biosynthesis involves two reactions first geranyl diphosphate gpp is converted to methyl gpp catalyzed by methyltransferase second methyl gpp is cyclized by 2 mib synthase cyclase to 2 mib giglio et al 2011a komatsu et al 2008 the 2 mib gene operon of cyanobacterial strains constitutes of two cyclic nucleotide binding protein genes cnba and cnbb also called miba and mibd methyl transferase gene mtf also called mibb and 2 mib cyclase gene mic also called mibc wang et al 2011 chiu et al 2016 fig 3b even though the biosynthetic pathway for 2 mib synthesis is homologous in actinomycetes and cyanobacteria the order of genes in 2 mib operon is in reverse to that of the majority of actinomycetes cnb followed by mic and mtf fig 3b the reverse order in cyanobacteria is due to the recombination event occurred during the evolution giglio et al 2011a wang et al 2011 watson et al 2016 the genetic information about 2 mib in cyanobacteria opened the avenues for the development of molecular tools intending to monitor odor production as well as understand its relationship with corresponding synthesis genes chiu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 considering the advantages of qpcr few researchers have developed molecular protocols to monitor 2 mib production by cyanobacteria table 3 most of the designed qpcr primers targeted the mic gene encoding for 2 mib synthase cyclase of the 2 mib operon table 3 wang et al 2011 reported the first sybr green based rt pcr primers targeting methyltransferase mtsf mtsr as well as 2 mib cyclase mtcf mtcr to study their expression under different light intensities but the first qpcr protocol to detect and quantify potential 2 mib producing cyanobacteria was reported by wang et al 2016 based on the conserved regions of mic genes two primer sets were designed one for sybr green based mib rf mib rr and other for taqman based qpcr crtf crtr table 3 both the primer sets were linear in the range of 101 107 mic copies reaction with lod of 103 copies l the primers were rarely inhibited in high biomass pure cultures 107 109 cells ml suggesting its application for cyanobacterial bloom samples wang et al 2016 similarly chiu et al 2016 developed taqman based qpcr mibs02f mibs02r aligning 14 2 mib cyclase gene mic sequences the primer set was able to detect most of the 2 mib producing cyanobacteria leptolyngbya oscillatoria planktothricoides planktothrix andpseudoanabaena listed in the literature the primer demonstrated high linearity ranging from 102 107 mic copies µl along with a high amplification efficiency table 3 koltsidou 2019 designed taqman based qpcr primers cy mib s3f cy mib s3r using 2 mib cyclase gene sequences of 4 cyanobacterial species the primers were found to have low efficiency 64 5 86 5 due to the degenerate nature of primers and probes the study suggested further optimization of qpcr assays in regard to primer design and amplification efficiency gaget et al 2020 developed qpcr primers ms f1 ms f2 to detect benthic cyanobacteria producing 2 mib by aligning three cyanobacterial mic gene sequences the designed primers were highly sensitive and able to quantify four cell equivalent reaction indicating its application in environmental samples with a low number of cells kim et al 2020 designed primers specific to synechococcales and oscillatoriales based on mic gene sequences out of the eight primers designed three primers namely mibc132 mibc196 and mibc300 were selected based on their specificity for positive controls the mic gene of all the five strains belonging to synechococcales and oscillatoriales were amplified by primers mibc196 and mibc300 the mibc132 primer was highly specific for planktothricoides and pseudoanabaena mic the amplification efficiencies of primers mibc132 and mibc196 was higher 100 102 than the previous studies wang et al 2016 chiu et al 2016 all the studies suggest optimization of the primers annealing temperatures and development of multiplexing technique to quantify all the 2 mib producers in a given environmental sample 3 4 field application of developed qpcr primers for 2 mib producing cyanobacteria developed qpcr primers for detection and quantification of 2 mib producing cyanobacteria were assessed for their applicability on the field samples reservoirs lakes aquaculture from different geographical locations table 4 wang et al 2016 validated both the primers mib rf mib rr and crtf crtr developed by them for quantifying the variations in mic abundances in 32 samples collected from donghu lake lushui reservoir and qinghai lake of china a positive correlation r2 0 72 was revealed between the mic gene copy numbers and the 2 mib concentrations but no correlation was obtained with the 2 mib producing cyanobacteria wang et al 2016 2 mib production could be estimated as 10 to 60 fg per mic copy based on the high correlation the authors implied that the quantification of mic abundances using qpcr would be ideal for on site monitoring and prevention of t o events caused by cyanobacterial blooms it was also suggested that the frequency of monitoring could be increased when mic copy number reaches over 104 copies l and qpcr can be accompanied by chemical analysis when mic copy number is over 105 copies l in water samples wang et al 2016 the major concern raised in the study is that the effectiveness of qpcr will be affected by the variation in the mic copy number in different species hence there is a need to study multiple mic copy numbers in cyanobacterial species to correct the quantification results another factor that needs to be considered is growth conditions as it might increase the correlation of mic abundance and 2 mib content authors recommended the development of mrna based qpcr rt pcr for the direct quantification of mic transcripts for cyanobacteria in field samples wang et al 2016 sybr green based qpcr primers mib rf mib rr were also validated for field samples from shiyan reservoir rong et al 2018 and qingcaosha reservoir huang et al 2018 in china both the studies identified pseudoanabaena sp as the dominant 2 mib producer in the water samples rong et al 2018 identified a strong positive correlation between mic gene copy number and 2 mib concentration representing 10 fg 2 mib mic copy the results of the study are in concordance with the wang et al 2016 further strengthening the fact that qpcr primers can be used as an early warning method for 2 mib event in water systems huang et al 2018 established a positive correlation r2 0 401 between the mic copy number and the cell count of pseudoanabaena sp in the water samples however the study reported a low positive correlation r2 0 368 between the mic copy number and the 2 mib concentration compared to previous reports chiu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 the low correlation might be due to the dependence of expression of the gene on light and temperature as well as the varied distribution of intra and extracellular 2 mib concentration huang et al 2018 most of these studies have found a strong correlation between the mic copy number and the sediment water suggesting that sediments can be an essential source of 2 mib in water samples chiu et al 2016 huang et al 2018 rong et al 2018 wang et al 2016 hence the dna copy number of the odor genes can act as an indicator for the source tracking and monitoring of t o events in water systems the water samples from 29 drinking water reservoirs from taiwan main island kinmen and matsu island were quantified for 2 mib producers using qpcr primers mibs02f mibs02r chiu et al 2016 a significant correlation between the mic gene number and the 2 mib concentration was obtained from each reservoir r2 0 413 0 998 and all the three islands r2 0 473 0 479 it was observed that the mic gene number is closely related to the cell bound 2 mib concentrations in the water hence the measured gene abundance is the indicator of the number of intact cells with the intracellular 2 mib in the water sample and not the extracellular 2 mib concentration released by lysed cells chiu et al 2016 furthermore the variation in the correlation between mic copy number and the 2 mib level in reservoir samples might be due to the 2 mib producing species gene copy of the producing species cell quota 2 mib mass per cell and 2 mib production rate chiu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 the mic genes are not detected in the samples with 2 mib concentration below 5ng l lu et al 2019 applied the same qpcr primers mibs02f mibs02r for water samples from taiwan main and offshore island and the philippines laguna de bay the study concluded that the gene based approach for 2 mib risk alert systems is more accurate and specific compared to conventional time consuming cell count method the extensive geographical validation of the qpcr method implicates its applicability for setting reliable response levels for cyanobacteria and metabolites in drinking water reservoirs lu et al 2019 lindholm lehto et al 2019 applied qpcr for identifying the 2 mib producers in recirculating aquaculture system ras using mtcf mtcr primers developed by wang et al 2011 the primers underestimated the mic abundance in the ras even though high levels of 2 mib was detected it was implied that the 2 mib producers in ras might harbor unknown 2 mib synthase which cannot be quantified by the current methods hence it is crucial to obtain the sequence information of the unknown 2 mib synthase and use them to develop qpcr primers specific to ras water samples the taqman primers cy mib s3f cy mib s3r were validated for 2 mib events in eagle creek reservoir usa koltsidou 2019 correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between mic gene abundances and 2 mib concentration in all sampling locations similar to the aforementioned reports chiu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 gaget et al 2020 applied the highly sensitive primers ms f1 ms f2 for 2 mib produced by benthic cyanobacteria in sa l2 reservoir south australia the qpcr was able to detect mic gene copies even when no 2 mib was detected in the samples by gc ms the study suggested the use of qpcr to detect potential 2 mib producers even at low concentrations thus helping in early detection of the t o events the primers mibc196 and mibc132 developed by kim et al 2020 were tested for detection and quantification of mic using both environmental dna and rna samples collected from water column and sediments of gong ji stream south korea a significant correlation was observed between the 2 mib concentration and mic copy numbers in both sediment correlation coefficient r 0 749 and water column r 0 644 the copy number and expression level of mibc196 primers was correlated with the cell density of p limnetica r 0 995 in the water column sample indicating p limnetica as major 2 mib producer in the gong ji stream 3 5 current status of developed primers for q pcr based detection to appropriately discuss and understand the geosmin 2 mib production issue via biomolecular approaches a well designed specific primer and probe set targeted on universal geosmin and 2 mib synthesis regions is crucial furthermore it is quintessential to characterize the conserved region in the target sequences among the species strains to develop universal primer and probes figs 4 and 5 it was observed that a total of 132 strains from 21 genera for geosmin production and 72 cyanobacterial strains from 13 genera for 2 mib production have been reported tables s1 and s2 however only 58 and 28 sequences of geosmin and 2 mib synthesis regions respectively have been assembled in the ncbi database to compare their similarity these available geosmin and 2 mib sequences were analyzed using clustalw multiple alignment bioedit software usa based on the identity of target sequences geosmin and 2 mib to 95 the 58 geosmin and 28 2 mib sequences can be grouped into 24 and 8 groups respectively figs 4 and 5 the grouping indicates a greater variation in the geosmin synthase conserved primer design region compared to 2 mib synthesis region even among strains of the same species figs 4 and 5 lack of conserved sequence for geosmin poses major hindrance in designing the universal primer probe as shown in tables 1 and 3 11 primer probe sets are available in the literature for geosmin and 2 mib each to understand if the published primer probe sets are able to align the target sequences groups the pairwise alignment bioedit software usa was run for the numbers of base pair difference between the primer probe and the target sequence regions for all the geosmin or 2 mib sequences assembled in the ncbi database among the 11 geosmin primers reported not a single primer probe was fully aligned perfectly matched with the geosmin synthase sequences of all the 24 groups whereas 2 3 primer probe sets from the 11 reported ones were able to align with the 2 mib sequences of all the 8 groups thus it can be inferred that the present qpcr primers developed for 2 mib have better potential to identify all the 2 mib cyanobacterial strains when compared to geosmin which is limited to few species strains identifications it suggests that future research needs to be more focused in primer designing for geosmin and field validation of existing 2 mib primers to develop an effective qpcr based tool for geosmin 2 mib event detection 4 conventional and emerging technologies for cyanobacterial geosmin and 2 mib detection 4 1 conventional methods of geosmin and 2 mib detection the conventional approaches including instrument based analysis sensory analysis or the combination of both have been applied to detect the t o compounds in water the detection and quantification of geosmin and 2 mib compounds are complicated due to their low odor threshold values 10 ng l lee et al 2017 liato and aïder 2017 lin et al 2003 2002 hence the analytical methodologies should be sensitive selective and simple to identify and quantify the compounds at trace levels callejón et al 2016 since these compounds are of microbial origin it is also essential to identify the source of the compounds to mitigate the associated drinking water hazards liato and aïder 2017 lu et al 2019 the traditional plate count and microscopic techniques are used to investigate the origin of t o compounds these cell count based methods enumerate and identify potential t o producing organisms and are commonly employed in water industries lu et al 2019 however the major drawbacks of the method are lack of correlation between cell abundance and concentration of t o compounds due to various reasons jüttner and watson 2007 first microbes i e actinomycetes and cyanobacteria are present in low numbers are difficult to culture and require selective media jüttner and watson 2007 second the identification of the cyanobacteria microscopically requires considerable technical expertise jüttner and watson 2007 su et al 2013 third the amount of t o compounds per cell depends on cyanobacterial strains as well as the environmental conditions lu et al 2019 besides the microscopic enumeration is time consuming and do not distinguish between t o producers and non producers jüttner and watson 2007 lee et al 2017 lu et al 2019 table 5 sensory analysis is used extensively for detection of t o compounds and assessment of the drinking water quality the human sensory system identifies and determines the concentrations along with the perception of t o compounds in the drinking water analysis tools like threshold odor number ton and flavour profile analysis fpa are recommended by standard methods bruchet 2019 lee et al 2017 sensory analysis is considered superior as it provides a more sensitive and integrative perception of the compounds compared to individual compounds identified by gas chromatography electronic noses or tongues burlingame et al 2017 reliable and accurate sensory analysis requires trained panelists with a good understanding of the t o compounds flavour descriptors and intensities burlingame et al 2017 dietrich and burlingame 2020 human assessors can further exhibit a wide range of individual sensitivities thus making t o compounds threshold measurements more difficult burlingame et al 2017 with the advent of highly sensitive and accurate chromatographic analytical instruments gc ms is used to identify and measure t o compounds various preconditioning steps have been developed to improve further the sensitivity of the gc ms detection bristow et al 2019 the methods include closed loop stripping analysis clsa resin adsorption ra solid phase extraction spe solid phase microextraction spme stir bar sorptive extraction sbse liquid phase microextraction lpme purge and trap p t static headspace sh and dynamic headspace dh among the pre conditioning methods spme which is simple easily automated and fast extraction method is one of the popular microextraction techniques the extraction efficiency and sensitivity of the technique up to 1 ng l depend on the selection of spme fibres sampling technique headspace or direct immersion extraction temperature and time significant issues with the spme fibres are contamination between samples and decreased fibre performance due to repeated use during routine analysis also the fibres are fragile thus making the process expensive and less reliable bristow et al 2019 bruchet 2019 another solvent free extraction gaining attention is p t method it can detect t o compounds below human threshold values 10 ng l in real water samples but the contamination of the traps while analyzing complex matrices may result in carry over effects affecting the reliability p t can be expensive and time consuming due to the complex flow path bristow et al 2019 bruchet 2019 overall gc ms along with pre conditioning is now a standard method used for the quantification of geosmin and 2 mib in water samples apha et al 2012 twepa niea w537 51b however the method can be a time consuming and expensive process for a large number of samples the cleanup and separation steps can slow down the turnover adding to the sample analysis time other drawbacks include the requirement of technical expertise expense and large size of the instrument restricting its usage for on site application and inability to identify the source of t o problem bristow et al 2019 john et al 2018 lu et al 2019 4 2 emerging technologies development of rapid sensitive high throughput and simple on site monitoring and analysis tools for detection of cyanobacterial geosmin and 2 mib using new technologies is of prime importance for the researchers the exploration has led to the application of chemical and biosensors li et al 2019 lvova et al 2020 migliorini et al 2019 son et al 2015 sukekawa et al 2019 surface enhanced raman scattering sers botta et al 2018 and sequencing technologies gaget et al 2020 otten et al 2016 te et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 for detection of taste and odor compounds and the associated cyanobacterial communities in the current section we will be focusing on the bioelectronic nose sers and nanopore sequencing as the future potential technologies for cyanobacterial geosmin and 2 mib monitoring and detection tools 4 2 1 bioelectronic nose the bioelectronic nose is the integration of odor recognition elements i e olfactory receptors ors found in natural systems with sensor devices that convert biological signals into electrical or optical signals park 2014 son et al 2015 in contrast to conventional electronic nose the bioelectronic nose is considered to mimic human olfactory system with high sensitivity femtomolar range in liquid and parts per trillion range in gaseous conditions and rapid real time detection of target molecules dung et al 2018 bioelectronic noses are relatively simple in operation compared to the conventional gc ms that required skilled technicians and pretreatments the possibility of integrating and multiplexing bioelectronic noses into small chips provides an opportunity to develop portable devices suitable for on site analysis cave et al 2019 son et al 2017 son et al 2015 developed human olfactory receptor hor based bioelectronic nose combined with olfactory nanovesicles functionalized with single walled carbon nanotube swcnt field effect transistor fet the hors selected was specific and sensitive to geosmin hor51s1 and 2 mib hor3a4 detection in the water sample the sensors were designed for simultaneous detection of both the odorants in the water sample for better accuracy the real time monitoring of geosmin and 2 mib has lod of 10 ng l each and is comparable to the conventional gc ms method it was also observed that the target molecules could be detected even when a complex mixture of odorants was present in the water sample the analysis time was fast and did not involve any odor extraction step pretreatment although authors recommended the use of bioelectronic nose for fast on site monitoring of geosmin 2 mib events with high throughput and accuracy only three water samples were tested and no calibration curves were constructed between geosmin 2 mib concentration and responses to be applied for monitoring the technology needs to be further developed for stability concentration responses and effect of water matrix on the measurement including natural organic matters noms and ions present in lakes and reservoirs other limitations include high cost of the equipment complicated calibration problems with mass production of olfactory receptors durability stability and immobilization of receptors on secondary transducers wasilewski et al 2017 4 2 2 surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers sers an advancement of conventional raman spectroscopy has emerged as powerful rapid detection analytical tool owing to its simplicity high sensitivity signal specificity quantifiability multiplexing capability and photostability jia et al 2018 li et al 2019 luo et al 2014 the enhancement is predominately by two mechanisms electromagnetic em and chemical effects cm sers utilizes the localized surface plasmon resonances lsprs around the plasmonic nanostructures resulting in electromagnetic enhancement with a factor up to 1010 1014 botta et al 2018 li et al 2019 luo et al 2014 different sers detection strategies such as label free or label mediated types were developed based on the target analyte jia et al 2018 the target analyte can be any biomolecule such as dna protein rna carbohydrate lipids secondary metabolite or even whole cells jia et al 2018 concerning cyanobacterial metabolites sers is extensively applied for detection of microcystin hassanain et al 2017 he et al 2019 li et al 2019 pang et al 2020 recently botta et al 2018 developed silver nanorod sers chips for detection of 2 mib the sers chips were ultrasensitive with detection of 2 mib at a concentration of 1 ng l in aqueous solutions and good linearity between intensity of measurement and 2 mib concentrations of 1 ng l to 100 μg l the chips were reusable with three cycles of cleaning and sensing but the study is performed in ultrapure water and effect of noms as well as ions in natural waters on the measurements need to be further explored sers based dna detection has gained considerable interest and has been applied for the detection of bacteria virus parasites and fungi huang et al 2019 jia et al 2018 ngo et al 2016 su et al 2017 xu et al 2015 the advances in sers based dna detection has potential for application in monitoring as well as quantification of geosmin 2 mib gene copy numbers in cyanobacteria however there will be a need to fabricate low cost suitable nano surfaces using micro nano fabrication technology as well as identification of interfering substances in natural water samples 4 2 3 nanopore sequencing as discussed earlier the major problem in the development of molecular detection techniques for t o events is the lack of sequence information about cyanobacterial t o genes as well as detection of the very low amount of target dna molecules there is limited knowledge of the diversity of the cyanobacterial community in different water bodies and aquaculture systems in different geographical locations advances in next generation sequencing providing the metagenomic information from pcr amplicons or directly from the environmental nucleic acid samples has potential to overcome the aforementioned issues with t o events detections alvarenga et al 2017 brown et al 2017 tan et al 2015 over the past years researchers have focused on the elucidation of taste and odor producing cyanobacteria as well as the diversity of associated genes using next generation sequencing techniques such as illumina miseq sequencing platform otten et al 2016 te et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the main limitation of 16s amplicon sequences using the illumina sequencing platform is small read lengths of only till 300 bp as well as the cost associated with the sequencing in which the former one will limit the determination of cyanobacterial species development of single molecule real time sequencing technology smrt such as pacbio and oxford nanopore minion has provided the opportunity to generate sequences with reading lengths covering up to 1000 bp thus enhancing our capability in detecting the unknown cyanobacterial communities alvarenga et al 2017 brown et al 2017 curren et al 2019 tan et al 2015 minion based on nanopore technology has got a lot of attention due to its low cost and portability the real time capabilities of the sequencer allow fast sample identification within 24 hours for long reads of up to 150 kb curren et al 2018 the minion sequencer has been used to study the harmful cyanobacterial species curren et al 2018 genomic characterization of microcystis yamaguchi et al 2019 and metagenome studies brown et al 2017 calus et al 2018 cuscó et al 2019 hence nanopore sequencing holds promise in the detection of taste and odor producing cyanobacteria allowing future developments of real time monitoring tools for t o events at present use of nanopore sequencing is hampered due to high sequence error rates nearly 30 compromising the accuracy of the generated reads alvarenga et al 2017 brown et al 2017 tan et al 2015 however this can be overcome with the advancements of enhanced sequence chemistry the suitable pipeline of bioinformatic tools for accurate identification and reduced error rate opening real time on site monitoring platform for cyanobacterial blooms and associated t o events especially in the areas lacking conventional laboratory facilities 5 current challenges for q pcr based detection extensive studies by multiple researchers tables 1 2 3 and 4 have suggested q pcr as promising tool for early detection and monitoring system for cyanobacterial blooms some eventually leading to geosmin 2 mib events it offers advantage of detecting the source organism even at very low concentrations gaget et al 2020 su et al 2013 the limit of detection lod is as low as 101 copies ml tsao et al 2014 and 102 copies ml chiu et al 2016 for geo and mic qpcr detection systems respectively the presence or absence of target odor genes by qpcr can distinguish odor producing cyanobacterial strains from non producers which is a major limitation of conventional techniques chiu et al 2017 2016 kutovaya and watson 2014 su et al 2013 tsao et al 2014 qpcr has quick turn around times with capability to analyze multiple samples in single run after sampling the genes can be analyzed by qpcr within 3 hours for at least 48 samples whereas conventional techniques such as microscopic enumeration need more than 24 hours to obtain the results for similar number of samples chiu et al 2017 the correlation of gene copy numbers with the concentration of geosmin 2 mib allows the quantification of the compounds by the producers both geo and mic genes can be detected by qpcr when geosmin and 2 mib concentration respectively is at above the loq of 5 ng l chiu et al 2016 gaget et al 2020 wang et al 2016 it is concluded in the studies that long term sample collection and qpcr analysis will help in establishing a good correlation between gene copy number and concentration eventually serving as a useful early monitoring tool for geosmin 2 mib episodes in water bodies lu et al 2019 concluded that the gene based approach for 2 mib risk alert systems is more accurate and specific compared to conventional time consuming cell count method the extensive geographical validation of the qpcr method implicates its applicability for setting reliable response levels for cyanobacteria and metabolites in drinking water reservoirs the major challenges with qpcr based detection are lack of standardized work flow high variations due to sampling dna extraction and quantification errors limited capacity of the primers to detect all the cyanobacterial species and strains involved in the geosmin 2 mib events non specific amplification by the developed primers development of multiplex qpcr as well as low efficiency during field applications unlike conventional techniques it is difficult to propose a standard protocol for qpcr assay as the steps are governed by cyanobacterial species origin source of the sample matrix interference nucleic acid concentration target gene copy number and environmental conditions hence selection of appropriate workflow will depend on the aim of the study with validation in different geographical locations goldberg et al 2016 harper et al 2019 various steps involved in qpcr like sampling pre treatments dna extraction as well as quantification are prone to errors eventually leading to high variations in results sampling errors can be avoided by ensuring presence absence along with quantity of target organisms considering variations of factors like sampling season depth and area of sample collection as well as sample preservation methods goldberg et al 2016 most important precaution during sampling is minimizing the chance of contamination and inclusion of negative controls to prevent any false positives during qpcr amplification goldberg et al 2016 selection of appropriate dna extraction method is another crucial parameter for qpcr amplification and quantitation the choice of method depends on cyanobacterial species growth phase of the organism gene copy numbers and removal of pcr inhibitors or matrix components however the extraction efficiencies vary within as well as across the methods resulting in variations in outcomes goldberg et al 2016 medlin and orozco 2017 su et al 2013 observed higher variation in samples with high dna concentration or cell density use of simple extraction method with lower efficiency such as microwave extraction rather than commercial dna extraction kits can be the potential solution to reduce the variation it is observed that majority of the primers developed are targeted either toward anabaena or nostoc sp even though nearly 132 geosmin producing cyanobacterial species strains are documented wang et al 2019 the plausible reason for it is lack of reference geo sequences in the current gene databases table s1 hence it is crucial to study diverse cyanobacterial geo sequences to develop and establish new primers and protocols moore 2019 wang et al 2019 similarly the primers developed for 2 mib can detect only the cyanobacterial species strains with available mic gene sequences in database chiu et al 2016 lindholm lehto et al 2019 due to lack of universal primers figs 4 and 5 the present qpcr protocols are specific to one or few cyanobacterial groups and hence requires the use of multiple primers probes to study a much broader spectrum of geosmin 2 mib producing cyanobacteria in natural systems therefore sequence analysis studies and development of new primers will also provide information about dominant species of cyanobacteria commonly responsible for geosmin events in different geographical locations the data is crucial for early detection of geosmin events even before the cyanobacterial bloom arises another aspect highlighted by most of the studies is the need of primer design as well as annealing temperature optimization to prevent non specific amplification by the primers other geosmin producers like actinomycetes and myxobacteria have geo with high sequence similarity with the cyanobacteria wang et al 2019 similarly 2 mib biosynthetic precursors are closely associated with chlorophyll a synthesis hence there is possibility of partial similarity between sequences of target amplicon for mic and chl a kim et al 2020 the similarity in the sequences could result in the non specific amplification and thus requires utmost care while primer designing for both geosmin and 2 mib detection chiu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 quantification of dna is another possible source of error variations in the qpcr results in conventional techniques like gc ms the standard curve for geosmin 2 mib is sufficient for quantification but in case of qpcr the dna content vary among cyanobacterial species and hence standard curve must be made for each target species medlin and orozco 2017 furthermore the gene copy number vary among different strains as well as growth phases tsao et al 2014 wang et al 2016 and must be considered in calculating dna concentration thus minimize the possible quantification errors multiplex qpcr is useful in detecting several organisms within a sample but due to limitation of number of available reporter dyes for separate probes the number of target organisms is usually limited to six medlin and orozco 2017 a solution to the problem is high throughput multiplex pcr assay which can consist of 7 14 different amplification targets per mix taniuchi et al 2011 wei et al 2018 the failure of the multiplex system may be caused by differences in primer concentration probe concentration polymerase dntp buffer concentration annealing extension time and amount of template dna chiu et al 2017 therefore multiplexing requires optimization to enhance the efficiency of different primer probe combinations in single reaction in applying multiplex qpcr systems inter influence of gene abundance where the detection of a lower gene concentration was inhibited by the ample presence of other targeted genes has been reported chiu et al 2017 te et al 2015 even though the primers developed have been validated for field applications the studies are either restricted to one reservoir in one two particular seasons or to one geographical location tables 2 and 4 the limited field testing questions the validity and efficiency of the developed primers for their universal application for monitoring geosmin 2 mib events most of the field studies have indicated either no or low correlation between the gene copy numbers and the cyanobacterial cell density the low correlation is due to lack of universal specific primers and inability to identify the cyanobacterial species with unknown sequences in the water sample which might be the major producer of the geosmin 2 mib koltsidou 2019 lindholm lehto et al 2019 furthermore significant variations are observed for gene copy numbers and odor compound concentrations in water samples the variation might be due to presence of different geosmin 2 mib species growth and cell quota of the species geosmin 2 mib production rates as well as the environmental conditions during the water sampling chiu et al 2016 jørgensen et al 2016 wang et al 2016 most of the qpcr methods developed for geosmin 2 mib are dna based which is simple and appropriate for routine water analysis otten et al 2016 but certain studies kim et al 2020 koltsidou 2019 wang et al 2016 suggested that origin of dna in environmental sample can either be from dead or living organism the result does not indicate the metabolic active cells in the samples further mere presence of the gene copies does not ensure the expression of the gene and thus results in low correlation with geosmin 2 mib concentrations in such cases rna based qpcr can provide valuable insight into the metabolic active cells and expression of the geosmin 2 mib genes in the environmental samples 6 conclusion the key to early response and control of increasing cyanobacterial blooms and associated geosmin 2 mib events is development of rapid robust on site early detection and monitoring system as a part of this review an interactive user friendly map based database was developed to provide updated information on the origin geographical distribution cyanobacterial producers and monitoring techniques for global geosmin 2 mib events with the advances in biomolecular techniques qpcr has emerged as most promising system for the early on site detection of geosmin 2 mib events overcoming the limitations of existing time consuming conventional techniques both sybr green as well as taqman based qpcr methods detect cyanobacterial blooms with high specificity quantifying low cell numbers and handling multiple samples in a single run they provide added advantage of simultaneous identification of the known and unknown odor producers and quantification of the odor compounds the validation of primers and probes on field implicates that dna copy number of the odor genes can act as an indicator for the source tracking and monitoring of geosmin 2 mib events in water systems apart from qpcr other emerging techniques such as bioelectronic nose sers and nanopore sequencing has potential for use as real time on site monitoring platform for cyanobacterial blooms and associated t o events and thus needs future investigations but lack of standardized work flow high variations due to sampling dna extraction and quantification errors limited capacity of the primers to detect all the cyanobacterial species and strains involved in the geosmin 2 mib events non specific amplification by the developed primers development of multiplex qpcr as well as low efficiency during field applications are major hindrance

17390,taste and odor t o are an important issue in drinking water aquaculture recreation and a few other associated industries and cyanobacteria relevant geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib are the two most commonly detected t o compounds worldwide a rise in the cyanobacterial blooms and associated geosmin 2 mib episodes due to anthropogenic activities as well as climate change has led to global concerns for drinking water quality the increasing awareness for the safe drinking aquaculture or recreational water systems has boost the demand for rapid robust on site early detection and monitoring system for cyanobacterial geosmin 2 mib events in past years research has indicated quantitative pcr qpcr as one of the promising tools for detection of geosmin 2 mib episodes it offers advantages of detecting the source organism even at very low concentrations distinction of odor producing cyanobacterial strains from non producers and evaluation of odor producing potential of the cyanobacteria at much faster rates compared to conventional techniques the present review aims at examining the current status of developed qpcr primers and probes in identifying and detecting the cyanobacterial blooms along with geosmin 2 mib events among the more than 100 articles about cyanobacteria associated geosmin 2 mib in drinking water systems published after 1990 limited reports approx 10 each for geosmin and 2 mib focused on qpcr detection and its application in the field based on the review of literature a comprehensive open access global cyanobacterial geosmin 2 mib events database cyanogm explorer is curated it acts as a single platform to access updated information related to origin and geographical distribution of geosmin 2 mib events cyanobacterial producers frequency and techniques associated with the monitoring of the events although a total of 132 cyanobacterial strains from 21 genera and 72 cyanobacterial strains from 13 genera have been reported for geosmin and 2 mib production respectively only 58 geosmin and 28 2 mib synthesis regions have been assembled in the ncbi database based on the identity geosmin sequences were found to be more diverse in the geosmin synthase conserved primer design region compared to 2 mib synthesis region hindering the design of universal primers probes emerging technologies such as the bioelectronic nose surface enhanced raman scattering sers and nanopore sequencing are discussed for future applications in early on site detection of geosmin 2 mib and producers in the end the paper also highlights various challenges in applying qpcr as a universal system of monitoring and development of response system for geosmin 2 mib episodes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biomolecular drinking water database geo mic monitoring taq man probes 1 introduction cyanobacteria are ubiquitous and a primary part of the food webs in freshwater ecosystems paerl et al 2001 nevertheless eutrophication and pollution of freshwater results in a drastic increase in the cyanobacterial biomass causing the blooms lee et al 2017 the blooms have a considerable economic impact based on drinking water quality and safety aquacultures productivity and recreational water body activities bruchet 2019 the cyanobacterial blooms are the prime cause for deteriorating water quality by causing hypoxia and anoxia of bottom waters toxin production food web alterations fish kills and foul taste and odor t o events paerl et al 2001 blooms of certain cyanobacteria produce potent neurotoxins anatoxin and saxitoxin and hepatotoxins microcystin cylindrospermopsin and nodularin posing severe health hazards chiu et al 2017 2016 lee et al 2017 other volatile organic compounds produced by cyanobacteria such as sulfur compounds carotenoid derivatives fatty acid derivatives amines and terpenoids are associated with offensive taste and odor issues in the water bruchet 2019 the t o events have implications for the aesthetics integrity and safety of drinking as well as recreational water hence gaining considerable attention of researchers among the various odorants identified geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib responsible for musty or earthy odor are widely studied bruchet 2019 lee et al 2017 watson et al 2016 over the years numerous cases involving the two odorants have been reported in north america australia europe china japan taiwan philippines and south africa su et al 2015 as depicted in fig 1 both geosmin and 2 mib have very low odor threshold value 10 ng l and it is difficult to remove effectively using conventional water treatment processes lu et al 2019 tsao et al 2014 furthermore lack of any clear pattern between the geosmin 2 mib production and endogenous factors associated with cyanobacteria as well as exogenous environmental factors light temperature nutrient supply and dissolved oxygen makes it challenging to monitor and predict t o events effectively watson et al 2016 challenges posed by geosmin 2 mib events worldwide have led to an escalation in the scientific enquiry as evident from fig 2 into its origin abiotic factors detection treatment and management bruchet 2019 over last three decades there is gradual increase in the reports of geosmin and 2 mib in drinking water fig 2 and most of them have been associated with the cyanobacterial blooms john et al 2018 continuous advancements in analytical chemistry have led to the development of ultrasensitive separation detection identification methods for geosmin 2 mib bruchet 2019 lee et al 2017 the taxonomic advancements lu et al 2019 and increase in geosmin 2 mib reports has led to identification of large numbers of geosmin table s1 as well as 2 mib producing bacteria table s2 in the literature hence the current monitoring and control approaches for t o events employ a combination of taxonomic classification with various analytical instruments the time associated with the entire approach is quite long one to several days beginning from the collection of samples transportation and storage laboratory analysis and reporting lu et al 2019 the long turn over time prohibits source water managers and or water utilities to rapidly adopt appropriate control measures if the t o compounds are present in the source water hence there is an increasing demand for the rapid robust sensitive on line monitoring and early detection system for the t o events advances in the genomic technologies and discovery of biosynthetic pathways for geosmin 2 mib have lured the researchers towards the development of biomolecular approaches for early detection of the t o events john et al 2018 lee et al 2017 lu et al 2019 lukassen et al 2019a b wang et al 2019 the present review focuses on shedding light on the biomolecular techniques current as well as emerging technologies for geosmin and 2 mib detection in water systems based on the review of literature an open access database is developed to provide updated information on the occurrence and monitoring techniques for global geosmin 2 mib events this review attempts to provide a detailed analysis of the quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr as a promising tool for early on site detection of geosmin 2 mib along with current status of available primers to detect all the geo and mib sequences in ncbi database furthermore emerging technologies such as the bioelectronic nose surface enhanced raman scattering sers and nanopore sequencing are examined with a potential application in early on site detection of geosmin 2 mib and or their producers in the end the paper highlights the various challenges of qpcr based detection for geosmin 2 mib producing cyanobacteria 2 geosmin and 2 mib events occurrences in the globe the present review indicated that there is lack of single platform providing access to updated information on the origin and geographical distribution of geosmin 2 mib events cyanobacterial producers frequency and techniques associated with the monitoring of the events search based on the various keywords related to geosmin 2 mib using existing search engines is often time consuming and tiring further the researchers are prone to miss certain less important frequent events based on the keywords used during the search process hence keeping all the above issues a comprehensive up to date database cyanogm explorer https cyanogmexp ncku edu tw on cyanobacterial geosmin 2 mib events occurred globally is curated as a part of the present paper the key feature of the database is an interactive user friendly map comprising of up to date cyanobacterial geosmin and 2 mib events across the globe the locations of events can be accessed for additional information like sampling year the technique used for the detection of geosmin 2 mib and publication year along with the reference paper another essential feature of the database is the ability of researchers to update the map with new geosmin 2 mib events after registration and authentication of the users it will provide researchers to highlight the work on the global platform and future directions to geosmin 2 mib detection and monitoring the present map provides valuable information regarding the geographical distribution of the geosmin 2 mib events it can be inferred that there is a higher incidence of geosmin events in the united states of america canada and australia whereas 2 mib events in china taiwan and south korea the difference in geographical distribution suggests that the algal community and the environmental conditions govern the incidence and frequency of t o events furthermore the higher rate of geosmin 2 mib events in certain countries might also represent active monitoring and reporting of the events on the global platform compared to the countries with no low incidence in a nutshell cyanogm explorer can be an effective tool for predicting and providing future directions to the detection and monitoring of the geosmin 2 mib events it can be a possible platform for the researchers working with geosmin 2 mib to interact collaborate and share their research ideas in the community 3 biomolecular methods for detection of geosmin and 2 mib producers biomolecular methods like polymerase chain reaction pcr and quantitative pcr qpcr are developed after the discovery of genes involved in the geosmin and 2 mib biosynthetic pathways cane and watt 2003 dickschat et al 2007 giglio et al 2011a 2008 gust et al 2003 komatsu et al 2008 wang and cane 2008 the exploration of the origin diversity and evolution of these genes in cyanobacteria as well as other bacteria is leading to the continuous improvements of the methods in the recent years wang et al 2019 these techniques have gained considerable interests due to their specificity ability to identify the source of the problem detecting low cell numbers and handling multiple samples in a single run these advantages give them an edge to be used for rapid onsite monitoring of t o events inexpensively chiu et al 2017 2016 john et al 2018 lee et al 2017 lu et al 2019 pcr protocols are extensively developed for both geosmin and 2 mib targeting the biosynthetic genes pcr targeting geosmin synthase gene have been developed for cyanobacteria genera such as nostoc anabaena geitlerinema aphanizomenon lyngbya phormidium and oscillatoria genera giglio et al 2008 kutovaya and watson 2014 su et al 2013 suurnäkki et al 2015 2 mib gene detection by pcr protocol is limited to cyanobacteria genera anabaena oscillatoria planktothrix pseudoanabaena and phormidium giglio et al 2011a suurnäkki et al 2015 wang et al 2011 however none of these developed primers targets all the geosmin and 2 mib producing cyanobacteria multiple primers pairs with different amplification protocols are required for routine monitoring john et al 2018 and hence there is a need to develop the universal targeting primers john et al 2018 developed a novel small amplicon pcr primer able to distinguish all geosmin producing cyanobacteria using a single protocol no such universal pcr primers have been reported for 2 mib producing cyanobacteria another major drawback of pcr is its inability to quantify the amplified products even though various end point analysis can be used for quantification factors such as pcr inhibitors pyrophosphate accumulation or reagent limitation can make it unreliable moore 2019 without the quantification of the amplified dna it is challenging to develop pcr based monitoring systems for the geosmin and 2 mib events hence the simplest and best alternative to this drawback is the development of quantitative pcr qpcr protocols which is discussed in detail in the following sections 3 1 primers for detection of geosmin producers the genes and biosynthetic pathway involved in geosmin synthesis are elucidated in recent years for both actinomycetes as well as cyanobacteria jüttner and watson 2007 fig 3 a geosmin production involves cyclization of universal c15 sesquiterpene precursor i e farnesyl diphosphate to geosmin by enzyme geosmin synthase the gene encoding geosmin synthase in streptomyces was identified independently by gust et al 2003 and cane and watt 2003 using pcr targeted gene replacement and amplification respectively jüttner and watson 2007 two putative genes geoa1 and geoa2 were first cloned from cyanobacteria phormidium sp by ludwig et al 2007 using degenerated pcr primers designed from the conserved region of geo in streptomyces later giglio et al 2008 identified complete geosmin synthase geo in nostoc punctiforme the geosmin synthase gene geo is the main target for the development of qpcr primers specific to cyanobacteria table 1 the qpcr methods yet developed either focused on quantification of geosmin producing bacteria or species composition analysis of geosmin producing cyanobacteria in different environments wang et al 2019 giglio et al 2008 reported the first geosmin synthase based qpcr for its application as a reliable diagnostic tool for cyanobacterial geosmin producers su et al 2013 designed the highly specific sybr green based qpcr assay gsg for detection of geosmin producing anabaena sp with a limit of detection lod of 0 02 pg dna and limit of quantification loq of 0 2 pg dna table 1 the method is capable of detecting the low concentration of anabaena geo 40 copy number in natural water samples it is also possible to track down all the anabaena blooming stages among other dominating algal species su et al 2013 the protocol when combined with arg primers developed in the same study provided quantification of the source as well as the odor producing potential of the cyanobacteria su et al 2013 tsao et al 2014 developed both sybr green based as well as taqman qpcr specific to the quantification of geosmin producing anabaena circinalis the method could successfully distinguish between non geosmin and geosmin producing anabaena sp both the primers 3139f 3245r and sgf1 jdr1 has a detection limit of 101 105 copies ml anabaena specific qpcr are also developed by other researchers with a better limit of detections and their applications in different geographical locations davis 2019 otten et al 2016 the geoa expression was evaluated in both benthic and planktonic cyanobacteria using degenerate cyanobacterial geosmin synthase primers geo cya543f and geo cya728r kutovaya and watson 2014 the primers could successfully identify the geosmin synthase for a wide range of geosmin producing cyanobacteria anabaena planktonica a ucrainica a lemmermanni a flos aquae a variabilis aphanizomenon gracile colothrix sp geitlerinema splendida lyngbya wollei phormidium and planktothrix in both laboratory cultures and natural samples however the qpcr protocol was focused on the expression study of the gene under various environmental conditions rather than exact quantification of the odor producing potential of these cyanobacteria moore 2019 developed taqman qpcr primers geo1f geo1r for identifying and distinguishing geosmin and non geosmin producing nostoc sp with a lod as low as 6 10 4 ng μl equivalent to 3 91 106 copies μl koltsidou 2019 designed qpcr primers cyn geo s5f cyn geo s5r for geosmin synthase gene in cyanobacteria but the primers have low amplification efficiency and suggested that might be due to the lower primer template kinetics of the degenerate primers 3 2 field application of developed qpcr primers for geosmin producing cyanobacteria field studies involving developed primers were demonstrated by multiple researchers in various geographical locations to validate the applicability of qpcr over conventional methods table 2 su et al 2013 quantified geosmin synthase gene gsg of spiked anabaena for a total of 63 field samples from 7 different water sources distributed over five districts of beijing china the gsg copy number significantly correlated coefficient of determination r2 0 68 with the geosmin concentrations of water samples measured using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis the study recommended the use of gsg qpcr as a predictive tool for geosmin events however higher variation was observed for gsg copy number and geosmin concentrations in samples with high dna concentration or cell density use of simple extraction method with lower efficiency such as microwave extraction rather than commercial dna extraction kits can be the potential solution to reduce the variation su et al 2013 tsao et al 2014 evaluated two sets of primers 3139f 3245r and sgf1 jdr1 specific to anabaena circinalis for myponga reservoir south australia table 2 both the primers indicated a significant correlation r2 0 79 between the geosmin gene copy number and microscopic cell density the gene copy number also depicted high correlation r2 0 87 and 0 78 for 3139f 3245r and sgf1 jdr1 respectively to the geosmin concentration measured by gc ms which is higher than the correlation reported by su et al 2013 it was the first field study for the rapid monitoring of geosmin production during a natural cyanobacterial bloom in a drinking water reservoir the taqman primer sgf1 jdr1 because of its higher specificity was used for evaluating geosmin producers in a recirculating aquaculture system for rearing rainbow trout lindholm lehto et al 2019 gaget et al 2020 used the sgf1 jdr1 for benthic cyanobacteria producing geosmin in sa l2 reservoir south australia a low correlation between the gene copy number and geosmin concentration suggested that benthic cyanobacteria contribute to a small portion of geosmin detected in water samples it was also observed that the geosmin synthase could be detected by qpcr only when geosmin concentration is above the loq of 4 ng l for the water samples collected at different seasons the geosmin concentration was between lod and loq values thus affecting the accuracy of the qpcr protocol and resulting in low correlation gaget et al 2020 qpcr primers geo cya543f geo cya728r was used to study the diversity of geosmin producing cyanobacteria in water samples from the great lakes including lakes erie michigan and ontario north america kutovaya and watson 2014 and leslie harrison dam reservoir little nerang and wyaralong of queensland australia jørgensen et al 2016 however kutovaya and watson 2014 did not study the correlation between geosmin concentration and the organism specific geosmin production rate as well as the abundance of geoa possessing cyanobacteria jørgensen et al 2016 did not get cyanobacterial geosmin synthase amplification and predicted the reason to be either low cell count or the non matching primers the authors reflected the possibility of genetic variability of geoa gene in geosmin producers in different geographical locations jørgensen et al 2016 ludwig et al 2007 highlighting the importance of diversity studies of cyanobacterial geosmin producers otten et al 2016 applied qpcr for geosmin producing anabaena in cheney reservoir kansas usa a strong positive correlation r2 0 71 was obtained between the geosmin concentration and anabaena geosmin synthase gene copies indicating anabaena as the principal producer organism during the study period the study suggested that the dna based methods compared to reverse transcriptase pcr rt pcr are simple and appropriate for routine analysis of drinking water samples otten et al 2016 moore et al 2019 using the taqman qpcr primers probes geo1f geo1r designed by the group to detect trace level of nostoc sp in the deer creek samples utah usa interestingly the nostoc sp was not identified by the conventional taxonomy methods in any of the analyzed samples the possible difference in results is either due to the low number of the cells or different sampling time for the studies the study indicates that the inexpensive and fast qpcr coupled with frequent sampling can be applied to study cyanobacterial population community dynamics in the reservoir throughout the year the major problem with the study was the inability of the qpcr probe to identify the cyanobacterial genera much more common to the deer creek reservoir than nostoc sp koltsidou et al 2019 designed the cyanobacterial geosmin qpcr primers cyn geo s5f cyn geo s5r and applied it for detection of geosmin in eagle creek reservoir indianapolis usa even the developed degenerate primers could not detect all the geosmin producers in the creek water samples hence it suggests the development of more comprehensive primers and probes for the broad application of qpcr to all the geosmin producing cyanobacteria also the correlation between geoa genes and the geosmin concentration in eagle creek samples varied among all the sampling sites r2 0 40 to 0 81 with a strong correlation for only 2 of the sampling sites koltsidou et al 2019 the variation might be due to the production rate of geosmin by organisms gene copy numbers and the growth phase of the producers chiu et al 2016 koltsidou 2019 another possibility for low correlation could be the underestimation of geoa genes quantities due to the ability of designed primers to detect only a few cyanobacterial geosmin producers 3 3 primers for detection of 2 mib producers apart from geosmin 2 mib is another major terpenoid responsible for t o problem in drinking water even at low concentrations watson et al 2016 more than 40 species of cyanobacteria including the genera of pseudoanabaena planktothrix planktothricoides phormidium oscillatoria and lyngbya have been reported as 2 mib producers chiu et al 2016 the biosynthetic pathway and genes involved in 2 mib production were first elucidated in actinomycetes dickschat et al 2007 komatsu et al 2008 wang and cane 2008 and later in cyanobacteria giglio et al 2011a wang et al 2011 2 mib biosynthesis involves two reactions first geranyl diphosphate gpp is converted to methyl gpp catalyzed by methyltransferase second methyl gpp is cyclized by 2 mib synthase cyclase to 2 mib giglio et al 2011a komatsu et al 2008 the 2 mib gene operon of cyanobacterial strains constitutes of two cyclic nucleotide binding protein genes cnba and cnbb also called miba and mibd methyl transferase gene mtf also called mibb and 2 mib cyclase gene mic also called mibc wang et al 2011 chiu et al 2016 fig 3b even though the biosynthetic pathway for 2 mib synthesis is homologous in actinomycetes and cyanobacteria the order of genes in 2 mib operon is in reverse to that of the majority of actinomycetes cnb followed by mic and mtf fig 3b the reverse order in cyanobacteria is due to the recombination event occurred during the evolution giglio et al 2011a wang et al 2011 watson et al 2016 the genetic information about 2 mib in cyanobacteria opened the avenues for the development of molecular tools intending to monitor odor production as well as understand its relationship with corresponding synthesis genes chiu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 considering the advantages of qpcr few researchers have developed molecular protocols to monitor 2 mib production by cyanobacteria table 3 most of the designed qpcr primers targeted the mic gene encoding for 2 mib synthase cyclase of the 2 mib operon table 3 wang et al 2011 reported the first sybr green based rt pcr primers targeting methyltransferase mtsf mtsr as well as 2 mib cyclase mtcf mtcr to study their expression under different light intensities but the first qpcr protocol to detect and quantify potential 2 mib producing cyanobacteria was reported by wang et al 2016 based on the conserved regions of mic genes two primer sets were designed one for sybr green based mib rf mib rr and other for taqman based qpcr crtf crtr table 3 both the primer sets were linear in the range of 101 107 mic copies reaction with lod of 103 copies l the primers were rarely inhibited in high biomass pure cultures 107 109 cells ml suggesting its application for cyanobacterial bloom samples wang et al 2016 similarly chiu et al 2016 developed taqman based qpcr mibs02f mibs02r aligning 14 2 mib cyclase gene mic sequences the primer set was able to detect most of the 2 mib producing cyanobacteria leptolyngbya oscillatoria planktothricoides planktothrix andpseudoanabaena listed in the literature the primer demonstrated high linearity ranging from 102 107 mic copies µl along with a high amplification efficiency table 3 koltsidou 2019 designed taqman based qpcr primers cy mib s3f cy mib s3r using 2 mib cyclase gene sequences of 4 cyanobacterial species the primers were found to have low efficiency 64 5 86 5 due to the degenerate nature of primers and probes the study suggested further optimization of qpcr assays in regard to primer design and amplification efficiency gaget et al 2020 developed qpcr primers ms f1 ms f2 to detect benthic cyanobacteria producing 2 mib by aligning three cyanobacterial mic gene sequences the designed primers were highly sensitive and able to quantify four cell equivalent reaction indicating its application in environmental samples with a low number of cells kim et al 2020 designed primers specific to synechococcales and oscillatoriales based on mic gene sequences out of the eight primers designed three primers namely mibc132 mibc196 and mibc300 were selected based on their specificity for positive controls the mic gene of all the five strains belonging to synechococcales and oscillatoriales were amplified by primers mibc196 and mibc300 the mibc132 primer was highly specific for planktothricoides and pseudoanabaena mic the amplification efficiencies of primers mibc132 and mibc196 was higher 100 102 than the previous studies wang et al 2016 chiu et al 2016 all the studies suggest optimization of the primers annealing temperatures and development of multiplexing technique to quantify all the 2 mib producers in a given environmental sample 3 4 field application of developed qpcr primers for 2 mib producing cyanobacteria developed qpcr primers for detection and quantification of 2 mib producing cyanobacteria were assessed for their applicability on the field samples reservoirs lakes aquaculture from different geographical locations table 4 wang et al 2016 validated both the primers mib rf mib rr and crtf crtr developed by them for quantifying the variations in mic abundances in 32 samples collected from donghu lake lushui reservoir and qinghai lake of china a positive correlation r2 0 72 was revealed between the mic gene copy numbers and the 2 mib concentrations but no correlation was obtained with the 2 mib producing cyanobacteria wang et al 2016 2 mib production could be estimated as 10 to 60 fg per mic copy based on the high correlation the authors implied that the quantification of mic abundances using qpcr would be ideal for on site monitoring and prevention of t o events caused by cyanobacterial blooms it was also suggested that the frequency of monitoring could be increased when mic copy number reaches over 104 copies l and qpcr can be accompanied by chemical analysis when mic copy number is over 105 copies l in water samples wang et al 2016 the major concern raised in the study is that the effectiveness of qpcr will be affected by the variation in the mic copy number in different species hence there is a need to study multiple mic copy numbers in cyanobacterial species to correct the quantification results another factor that needs to be considered is growth conditions as it might increase the correlation of mic abundance and 2 mib content authors recommended the development of mrna based qpcr rt pcr for the direct quantification of mic transcripts for cyanobacteria in field samples wang et al 2016 sybr green based qpcr primers mib rf mib rr were also validated for field samples from shiyan reservoir rong et al 2018 and qingcaosha reservoir huang et al 2018 in china both the studies identified pseudoanabaena sp as the dominant 2 mib producer in the water samples rong et al 2018 identified a strong positive correlation between mic gene copy number and 2 mib concentration representing 10 fg 2 mib mic copy the results of the study are in concordance with the wang et al 2016 further strengthening the fact that qpcr primers can be used as an early warning method for 2 mib event in water systems huang et al 2018 established a positive correlation r2 0 401 between the mic copy number and the cell count of pseudoanabaena sp in the water samples however the study reported a low positive correlation r2 0 368 between the mic copy number and the 2 mib concentration compared to previous reports chiu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 the low correlation might be due to the dependence of expression of the gene on light and temperature as well as the varied distribution of intra and extracellular 2 mib concentration huang et al 2018 most of these studies have found a strong correlation between the mic copy number and the sediment water suggesting that sediments can be an essential source of 2 mib in water samples chiu et al 2016 huang et al 2018 rong et al 2018 wang et al 2016 hence the dna copy number of the odor genes can act as an indicator for the source tracking and monitoring of t o events in water systems the water samples from 29 drinking water reservoirs from taiwan main island kinmen and matsu island were quantified for 2 mib producers using qpcr primers mibs02f mibs02r chiu et al 2016 a significant correlation between the mic gene number and the 2 mib concentration was obtained from each reservoir r2 0 413 0 998 and all the three islands r2 0 473 0 479 it was observed that the mic gene number is closely related to the cell bound 2 mib concentrations in the water hence the measured gene abundance is the indicator of the number of intact cells with the intracellular 2 mib in the water sample and not the extracellular 2 mib concentration released by lysed cells chiu et al 2016 furthermore the variation in the correlation between mic copy number and the 2 mib level in reservoir samples might be due to the 2 mib producing species gene copy of the producing species cell quota 2 mib mass per cell and 2 mib production rate chiu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 the mic genes are not detected in the samples with 2 mib concentration below 5ng l lu et al 2019 applied the same qpcr primers mibs02f mibs02r for water samples from taiwan main and offshore island and the philippines laguna de bay the study concluded that the gene based approach for 2 mib risk alert systems is more accurate and specific compared to conventional time consuming cell count method the extensive geographical validation of the qpcr method implicates its applicability for setting reliable response levels for cyanobacteria and metabolites in drinking water reservoirs lu et al 2019 lindholm lehto et al 2019 applied qpcr for identifying the 2 mib producers in recirculating aquaculture system ras using mtcf mtcr primers developed by wang et al 2011 the primers underestimated the mic abundance in the ras even though high levels of 2 mib was detected it was implied that the 2 mib producers in ras might harbor unknown 2 mib synthase which cannot be quantified by the current methods hence it is crucial to obtain the sequence information of the unknown 2 mib synthase and use them to develop qpcr primers specific to ras water samples the taqman primers cy mib s3f cy mib s3r were validated for 2 mib events in eagle creek reservoir usa koltsidou 2019 correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between mic gene abundances and 2 mib concentration in all sampling locations similar to the aforementioned reports chiu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 gaget et al 2020 applied the highly sensitive primers ms f1 ms f2 for 2 mib produced by benthic cyanobacteria in sa l2 reservoir south australia the qpcr was able to detect mic gene copies even when no 2 mib was detected in the samples by gc ms the study suggested the use of qpcr to detect potential 2 mib producers even at low concentrations thus helping in early detection of the t o events the primers mibc196 and mibc132 developed by kim et al 2020 were tested for detection and quantification of mic using both environmental dna and rna samples collected from water column and sediments of gong ji stream south korea a significant correlation was observed between the 2 mib concentration and mic copy numbers in both sediment correlation coefficient r 0 749 and water column r 0 644 the copy number and expression level of mibc196 primers was correlated with the cell density of p limnetica r 0 995 in the water column sample indicating p limnetica as major 2 mib producer in the gong ji stream 3 5 current status of developed primers for q pcr based detection to appropriately discuss and understand the geosmin 2 mib production issue via biomolecular approaches a well designed specific primer and probe set targeted on universal geosmin and 2 mib synthesis regions is crucial furthermore it is quintessential to characterize the conserved region in the target sequences among the species strains to develop universal primer and probes figs 4 and 5 it was observed that a total of 132 strains from 21 genera for geosmin production and 72 cyanobacterial strains from 13 genera for 2 mib production have been reported tables s1 and s2 however only 58 and 28 sequences of geosmin and 2 mib synthesis regions respectively have been assembled in the ncbi database to compare their similarity these available geosmin and 2 mib sequences were analyzed using clustalw multiple alignment bioedit software usa based on the identity of target sequences geosmin and 2 mib to 95 the 58 geosmin and 28 2 mib sequences can be grouped into 24 and 8 groups respectively figs 4 and 5 the grouping indicates a greater variation in the geosmin synthase conserved primer design region compared to 2 mib synthesis region even among strains of the same species figs 4 and 5 lack of conserved sequence for geosmin poses major hindrance in designing the universal primer probe as shown in tables 1 and 3 11 primer probe sets are available in the literature for geosmin and 2 mib each to understand if the published primer probe sets are able to align the target sequences groups the pairwise alignment bioedit software usa was run for the numbers of base pair difference between the primer probe and the target sequence regions for all the geosmin or 2 mib sequences assembled in the ncbi database among the 11 geosmin primers reported not a single primer probe was fully aligned perfectly matched with the geosmin synthase sequences of all the 24 groups whereas 2 3 primer probe sets from the 11 reported ones were able to align with the 2 mib sequences of all the 8 groups thus it can be inferred that the present qpcr primers developed for 2 mib have better potential to identify all the 2 mib cyanobacterial strains when compared to geosmin which is limited to few species strains identifications it suggests that future research needs to be more focused in primer designing for geosmin and field validation of existing 2 mib primers to develop an effective qpcr based tool for geosmin 2 mib event detection 4 conventional and emerging technologies for cyanobacterial geosmin and 2 mib detection 4 1 conventional methods of geosmin and 2 mib detection the conventional approaches including instrument based analysis sensory analysis or the combination of both have been applied to detect the t o compounds in water the detection and quantification of geosmin and 2 mib compounds are complicated due to their low odor threshold values 10 ng l lee et al 2017 liato and aïder 2017 lin et al 2003 2002 hence the analytical methodologies should be sensitive selective and simple to identify and quantify the compounds at trace levels callejón et al 2016 since these compounds are of microbial origin it is also essential to identify the source of the compounds to mitigate the associated drinking water hazards liato and aïder 2017 lu et al 2019 the traditional plate count and microscopic techniques are used to investigate the origin of t o compounds these cell count based methods enumerate and identify potential t o producing organisms and are commonly employed in water industries lu et al 2019 however the major drawbacks of the method are lack of correlation between cell abundance and concentration of t o compounds due to various reasons jüttner and watson 2007 first microbes i e actinomycetes and cyanobacteria are present in low numbers are difficult to culture and require selective media jüttner and watson 2007 second the identification of the cyanobacteria microscopically requires considerable technical expertise jüttner and watson 2007 su et al 2013 third the amount of t o compounds per cell depends on cyanobacterial strains as well as the environmental conditions lu et al 2019 besides the microscopic enumeration is time consuming and do not distinguish between t o producers and non producers jüttner and watson 2007 lee et al 2017 lu et al 2019 table 5 sensory analysis is used extensively for detection of t o compounds and assessment of the drinking water quality the human sensory system identifies and determines the concentrations along with the perception of t o compounds in the drinking water analysis tools like threshold odor number ton and flavour profile analysis fpa are recommended by standard methods bruchet 2019 lee et al 2017 sensory analysis is considered superior as it provides a more sensitive and integrative perception of the compounds compared to individual compounds identified by gas chromatography electronic noses or tongues burlingame et al 2017 reliable and accurate sensory analysis requires trained panelists with a good understanding of the t o compounds flavour descriptors and intensities burlingame et al 2017 dietrich and burlingame 2020 human assessors can further exhibit a wide range of individual sensitivities thus making t o compounds threshold measurements more difficult burlingame et al 2017 with the advent of highly sensitive and accurate chromatographic analytical instruments gc ms is used to identify and measure t o compounds various preconditioning steps have been developed to improve further the sensitivity of the gc ms detection bristow et al 2019 the methods include closed loop stripping analysis clsa resin adsorption ra solid phase extraction spe solid phase microextraction spme stir bar sorptive extraction sbse liquid phase microextraction lpme purge and trap p t static headspace sh and dynamic headspace dh among the pre conditioning methods spme which is simple easily automated and fast extraction method is one of the popular microextraction techniques the extraction efficiency and sensitivity of the technique up to 1 ng l depend on the selection of spme fibres sampling technique headspace or direct immersion extraction temperature and time significant issues with the spme fibres are contamination between samples and decreased fibre performance due to repeated use during routine analysis also the fibres are fragile thus making the process expensive and less reliable bristow et al 2019 bruchet 2019 another solvent free extraction gaining attention is p t method it can detect t o compounds below human threshold values 10 ng l in real water samples but the contamination of the traps while analyzing complex matrices may result in carry over effects affecting the reliability p t can be expensive and time consuming due to the complex flow path bristow et al 2019 bruchet 2019 overall gc ms along with pre conditioning is now a standard method used for the quantification of geosmin and 2 mib in water samples apha et al 2012 twepa niea w537 51b however the method can be a time consuming and expensive process for a large number of samples the cleanup and separation steps can slow down the turnover adding to the sample analysis time other drawbacks include the requirement of technical expertise expense and large size of the instrument restricting its usage for on site application and inability to identify the source of t o problem bristow et al 2019 john et al 2018 lu et al 2019 4 2 emerging technologies development of rapid sensitive high throughput and simple on site monitoring and analysis tools for detection of cyanobacterial geosmin and 2 mib using new technologies is of prime importance for the researchers the exploration has led to the application of chemical and biosensors li et al 2019 lvova et al 2020 migliorini et al 2019 son et al 2015 sukekawa et al 2019 surface enhanced raman scattering sers botta et al 2018 and sequencing technologies gaget et al 2020 otten et al 2016 te et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 for detection of taste and odor compounds and the associated cyanobacterial communities in the current section we will be focusing on the bioelectronic nose sers and nanopore sequencing as the future potential technologies for cyanobacterial geosmin and 2 mib monitoring and detection tools 4 2 1 bioelectronic nose the bioelectronic nose is the integration of odor recognition elements i e olfactory receptors ors found in natural systems with sensor devices that convert biological signals into electrical or optical signals park 2014 son et al 2015 in contrast to conventional electronic nose the bioelectronic nose is considered to mimic human olfactory system with high sensitivity femtomolar range in liquid and parts per trillion range in gaseous conditions and rapid real time detection of target molecules dung et al 2018 bioelectronic noses are relatively simple in operation compared to the conventional gc ms that required skilled technicians and pretreatments the possibility of integrating and multiplexing bioelectronic noses into small chips provides an opportunity to develop portable devices suitable for on site analysis cave et al 2019 son et al 2017 son et al 2015 developed human olfactory receptor hor based bioelectronic nose combined with olfactory nanovesicles functionalized with single walled carbon nanotube swcnt field effect transistor fet the hors selected was specific and sensitive to geosmin hor51s1 and 2 mib hor3a4 detection in the water sample the sensors were designed for simultaneous detection of both the odorants in the water sample for better accuracy the real time monitoring of geosmin and 2 mib has lod of 10 ng l each and is comparable to the conventional gc ms method it was also observed that the target molecules could be detected even when a complex mixture of odorants was present in the water sample the analysis time was fast and did not involve any odor extraction step pretreatment although authors recommended the use of bioelectronic nose for fast on site monitoring of geosmin 2 mib events with high throughput and accuracy only three water samples were tested and no calibration curves were constructed between geosmin 2 mib concentration and responses to be applied for monitoring the technology needs to be further developed for stability concentration responses and effect of water matrix on the measurement including natural organic matters noms and ions present in lakes and reservoirs other limitations include high cost of the equipment complicated calibration problems with mass production of olfactory receptors durability stability and immobilization of receptors on secondary transducers wasilewski et al 2017 4 2 2 surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers sers an advancement of conventional raman spectroscopy has emerged as powerful rapid detection analytical tool owing to its simplicity high sensitivity signal specificity quantifiability multiplexing capability and photostability jia et al 2018 li et al 2019 luo et al 2014 the enhancement is predominately by two mechanisms electromagnetic em and chemical effects cm sers utilizes the localized surface plasmon resonances lsprs around the plasmonic nanostructures resulting in electromagnetic enhancement with a factor up to 1010 1014 botta et al 2018 li et al 2019 luo et al 2014 different sers detection strategies such as label free or label mediated types were developed based on the target analyte jia et al 2018 the target analyte can be any biomolecule such as dna protein rna carbohydrate lipids secondary metabolite or even whole cells jia et al 2018 concerning cyanobacterial metabolites sers is extensively applied for detection of microcystin hassanain et al 2017 he et al 2019 li et al 2019 pang et al 2020 recently botta et al 2018 developed silver nanorod sers chips for detection of 2 mib the sers chips were ultrasensitive with detection of 2 mib at a concentration of 1 ng l in aqueous solutions and good linearity between intensity of measurement and 2 mib concentrations of 1 ng l to 100 μg l the chips were reusable with three cycles of cleaning and sensing but the study is performed in ultrapure water and effect of noms as well as ions in natural waters on the measurements need to be further explored sers based dna detection has gained considerable interest and has been applied for the detection of bacteria virus parasites and fungi huang et al 2019 jia et al 2018 ngo et al 2016 su et al 2017 xu et al 2015 the advances in sers based dna detection has potential for application in monitoring as well as quantification of geosmin 2 mib gene copy numbers in cyanobacteria however there will be a need to fabricate low cost suitable nano surfaces using micro nano fabrication technology as well as identification of interfering substances in natural water samples 4 2 3 nanopore sequencing as discussed earlier the major problem in the development of molecular detection techniques for t o events is the lack of sequence information about cyanobacterial t o genes as well as detection of the very low amount of target dna molecules there is limited knowledge of the diversity of the cyanobacterial community in different water bodies and aquaculture systems in different geographical locations advances in next generation sequencing providing the metagenomic information from pcr amplicons or directly from the environmental nucleic acid samples has potential to overcome the aforementioned issues with t o events detections alvarenga et al 2017 brown et al 2017 tan et al 2015 over the past years researchers have focused on the elucidation of taste and odor producing cyanobacteria as well as the diversity of associated genes using next generation sequencing techniques such as illumina miseq sequencing platform otten et al 2016 te et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the main limitation of 16s amplicon sequences using the illumina sequencing platform is small read lengths of only till 300 bp as well as the cost associated with the sequencing in which the former one will limit the determination of cyanobacterial species development of single molecule real time sequencing technology smrt such as pacbio and oxford nanopore minion has provided the opportunity to generate sequences with reading lengths covering up to 1000 bp thus enhancing our capability in detecting the unknown cyanobacterial communities alvarenga et al 2017 brown et al 2017 curren et al 2019 tan et al 2015 minion based on nanopore technology has got a lot of attention due to its low cost and portability the real time capabilities of the sequencer allow fast sample identification within 24 hours for long reads of up to 150 kb curren et al 2018 the minion sequencer has been used to study the harmful cyanobacterial species curren et al 2018 genomic characterization of microcystis yamaguchi et al 2019 and metagenome studies brown et al 2017 calus et al 2018 cuscó et al 2019 hence nanopore sequencing holds promise in the detection of taste and odor producing cyanobacteria allowing future developments of real time monitoring tools for t o events at present use of nanopore sequencing is hampered due to high sequence error rates nearly 30 compromising the accuracy of the generated reads alvarenga et al 2017 brown et al 2017 tan et al 2015 however this can be overcome with the advancements of enhanced sequence chemistry the suitable pipeline of bioinformatic tools for accurate identification and reduced error rate opening real time on site monitoring platform for cyanobacterial blooms and associated t o events especially in the areas lacking conventional laboratory facilities 5 current challenges for q pcr based detection extensive studies by multiple researchers tables 1 2 3 and 4 have suggested q pcr as promising tool for early detection and monitoring system for cyanobacterial blooms some eventually leading to geosmin 2 mib events it offers advantage of detecting the source organism even at very low concentrations gaget et al 2020 su et al 2013 the limit of detection lod is as low as 101 copies ml tsao et al 2014 and 102 copies ml chiu et al 2016 for geo and mic qpcr detection systems respectively the presence or absence of target odor genes by qpcr can distinguish odor producing cyanobacterial strains from non producers which is a major limitation of conventional techniques chiu et al 2017 2016 kutovaya and watson 2014 su et al 2013 tsao et al 2014 qpcr has quick turn around times with capability to analyze multiple samples in single run after sampling the genes can be analyzed by qpcr within 3 hours for at least 48 samples whereas conventional techniques such as microscopic enumeration need more than 24 hours to obtain the results for similar number of samples chiu et al 2017 the correlation of gene copy numbers with the concentration of geosmin 2 mib allows the quantification of the compounds by the producers both geo and mic genes can be detected by qpcr when geosmin and 2 mib concentration respectively is at above the loq of 5 ng l chiu et al 2016 gaget et al 2020 wang et al 2016 it is concluded in the studies that long term sample collection and qpcr analysis will help in establishing a good correlation between gene copy number and concentration eventually serving as a useful early monitoring tool for geosmin 2 mib episodes in water bodies lu et al 2019 concluded that the gene based approach for 2 mib risk alert systems is more accurate and specific compared to conventional time consuming cell count method the extensive geographical validation of the qpcr method implicates its applicability for setting reliable response levels for cyanobacteria and metabolites in drinking water reservoirs the major challenges with qpcr based detection are lack of standardized work flow high variations due to sampling dna extraction and quantification errors limited capacity of the primers to detect all the cyanobacterial species and strains involved in the geosmin 2 mib events non specific amplification by the developed primers development of multiplex qpcr as well as low efficiency during field applications unlike conventional techniques it is difficult to propose a standard protocol for qpcr assay as the steps are governed by cyanobacterial species origin source of the sample matrix interference nucleic acid concentration target gene copy number and environmental conditions hence selection of appropriate workflow will depend on the aim of the study with validation in different geographical locations goldberg et al 2016 harper et al 2019 various steps involved in qpcr like sampling pre treatments dna extraction as well as quantification are prone to errors eventually leading to high variations in results sampling errors can be avoided by ensuring presence absence along with quantity of target organisms considering variations of factors like sampling season depth and area of sample collection as well as sample preservation methods goldberg et al 2016 most important precaution during sampling is minimizing the chance of contamination and inclusion of negative controls to prevent any false positives during qpcr amplification goldberg et al 2016 selection of appropriate dna extraction method is another crucial parameter for qpcr amplification and quantitation the choice of method depends on cyanobacterial species growth phase of the organism gene copy numbers and removal of pcr inhibitors or matrix components however the extraction efficiencies vary within as well as across the methods resulting in variations in outcomes goldberg et al 2016 medlin and orozco 2017 su et al 2013 observed higher variation in samples with high dna concentration or cell density use of simple extraction method with lower efficiency such as microwave extraction rather than commercial dna extraction kits can be the potential solution to reduce the variation it is observed that majority of the primers developed are targeted either toward anabaena or nostoc sp even though nearly 132 geosmin producing cyanobacterial species strains are documented wang et al 2019 the plausible reason for it is lack of reference geo sequences in the current gene databases table s1 hence it is crucial to study diverse cyanobacterial geo sequences to develop and establish new primers and protocols moore 2019 wang et al 2019 similarly the primers developed for 2 mib can detect only the cyanobacterial species strains with available mic gene sequences in database chiu et al 2016 lindholm lehto et al 2019 due to lack of universal primers figs 4 and 5 the present qpcr protocols are specific to one or few cyanobacterial groups and hence requires the use of multiple primers probes to study a much broader spectrum of geosmin 2 mib producing cyanobacteria in natural systems therefore sequence analysis studies and development of new primers will also provide information about dominant species of cyanobacteria commonly responsible for geosmin events in different geographical locations the data is crucial for early detection of geosmin events even before the cyanobacterial bloom arises another aspect highlighted by most of the studies is the need of primer design as well as annealing temperature optimization to prevent non specific amplification by the primers other geosmin producers like actinomycetes and myxobacteria have geo with high sequence similarity with the cyanobacteria wang et al 2019 similarly 2 mib biosynthetic precursors are closely associated with chlorophyll a synthesis hence there is possibility of partial similarity between sequences of target amplicon for mic and chl a kim et al 2020 the similarity in the sequences could result in the non specific amplification and thus requires utmost care while primer designing for both geosmin and 2 mib detection chiu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 quantification of dna is another possible source of error variations in the qpcr results in conventional techniques like gc ms the standard curve for geosmin 2 mib is sufficient for quantification but in case of qpcr the dna content vary among cyanobacterial species and hence standard curve must be made for each target species medlin and orozco 2017 furthermore the gene copy number vary among different strains as well as growth phases tsao et al 2014 wang et al 2016 and must be considered in calculating dna concentration thus minimize the possible quantification errors multiplex qpcr is useful in detecting several organisms within a sample but due to limitation of number of available reporter dyes for separate probes the number of target organisms is usually limited to six medlin and orozco 2017 a solution to the problem is high throughput multiplex pcr assay which can consist of 7 14 different amplification targets per mix taniuchi et al 2011 wei et al 2018 the failure of the multiplex system may be caused by differences in primer concentration probe concentration polymerase dntp buffer concentration annealing extension time and amount of template dna chiu et al 2017 therefore multiplexing requires optimization to enhance the efficiency of different primer probe combinations in single reaction in applying multiplex qpcr systems inter influence of gene abundance where the detection of a lower gene concentration was inhibited by the ample presence of other targeted genes has been reported chiu et al 2017 te et al 2015 even though the primers developed have been validated for field applications the studies are either restricted to one reservoir in one two particular seasons or to one geographical location tables 2 and 4 the limited field testing questions the validity and efficiency of the developed primers for their universal application for monitoring geosmin 2 mib events most of the field studies have indicated either no or low correlation between the gene copy numbers and the cyanobacterial cell density the low correlation is due to lack of universal specific primers and inability to identify the cyanobacterial species with unknown sequences in the water sample which might be the major producer of the geosmin 2 mib koltsidou 2019 lindholm lehto et al 2019 furthermore significant variations are observed for gene copy numbers and odor compound concentrations in water samples the variation might be due to presence of different geosmin 2 mib species growth and cell quota of the species geosmin 2 mib production rates as well as the environmental conditions during the water sampling chiu et al 2016 jørgensen et al 2016 wang et al 2016 most of the qpcr methods developed for geosmin 2 mib are dna based which is simple and appropriate for routine water analysis otten et al 2016 but certain studies kim et al 2020 koltsidou 2019 wang et al 2016 suggested that origin of dna in environmental sample can either be from dead or living organism the result does not indicate the metabolic active cells in the samples further mere presence of the gene copies does not ensure the expression of the gene and thus results in low correlation with geosmin 2 mib concentrations in such cases rna based qpcr can provide valuable insight into the metabolic active cells and expression of the geosmin 2 mib genes in the environmental samples 6 conclusion the key to early response and control of increasing cyanobacterial blooms and associated geosmin 2 mib events is development of rapid robust on site early detection and monitoring system as a part of this review an interactive user friendly map based database was developed to provide updated information on the origin geographical distribution cyanobacterial producers and monitoring techniques for global geosmin 2 mib events with the advances in biomolecular techniques qpcr has emerged as most promising system for the early on site detection of geosmin 2 mib events overcoming the limitations of existing time consuming conventional techniques both sybr green as well as taqman based qpcr methods detect cyanobacterial blooms with high specificity quantifying low cell numbers and handling multiple samples in a single run they provide added advantage of simultaneous identification of the known and unknown odor producers and quantification of the odor compounds the validation of primers and probes on field implicates that dna copy number of the odor genes can act as an indicator for the source tracking and monitoring of geosmin 2 mib events in water systems apart from qpcr other emerging techniques such as bioelectronic nose sers and nanopore sequencing has potential for use as real time on site monitoring platform for cyanobacterial blooms and associated t o events and thus needs future investigations but lack of standardized work flow high variations due to sampling dna extraction and quantification errors limited capacity of the primers to detect all the cyanobacterial species and strains involved in the geosmin 2 mib events non specific amplification by the developed primers development of multiplex qpcr as well as low efficiency during field applications are major hindrance

17391,verocytotoxin producing e coli vtec are important agents of diarrhoeal disease in humans globally as a noted waterborne disease emphasis has been given to the study vtec in surface waters readily susceptible to microbial contamination conversely the status of vtec in potable groundwater sources generally regarded as a safe drinking water supply remains largely understudied as such this investigation presents the first scoping review seeking to determine the global prevalence of vtec in groundwater supply sources intended for human consumption twenty three peer reviewed studies were identified and included for data extraction groundwater sample and supply detection rates estimated 0 6 and 1 3 respectively indicate vtec is infrequently present in domestic groundwater sources however where generic fecal indicator e coli are present the vtec to e coli ratio was found to be 9 9 representing a latent health concern for groundwater consumers geographically extracted data indicates higher vtec detection rates in urban 5 4 and peri urban 4 9 environments than in rural areas 0 9 however this finding is confounded by the predominance of research studies in lower income regions climate trends indicate local environments classified as temperate 14 554 2 5 and cold 8 392 2 accounted for a majority of supply sources with vtec present with similar detection rates encountered among supplies sampled during periods typically characterized by high precipitation 15 649 2 3 proposed prevalence figures may find application in preventive risk based catchment and groundwater quality management including development of quantitative microbial risk assessments qmra notwithstanding to an extent a large geographical disparity in available investigations lack of standardized reporting and bias in source selection restrict the transferability of research findings overall the mechanisms responsible for vtec transport and ingress into groundwater supplies remain ambiguous representing a critical knowledge gap and denoting a distinctive lack of integration between hydrogeological and public health research key recommendations and guidelines are provided for prospective studies directed at increasingly integrative and multi disciplinary research graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction at present six e coli pathotypes collectively known as diarrhoeagenic e coli are recognized as clinically important verotoxigenic e coli vtec or shiga toxin producing e coli stec are characterized by the production of verocytotoxins stx1 stx2 similar to ab5 type shiga toxins which include enterohaemorrhagic e coli ehec strains bergan et al 2012 following ingestion and intestinal colonization verotoxins may form attaching and effacing a e enteric lesions in the host manifesting as gastrointestinal disease croxen et al 2013 over 400 vtec serotypes have been identified a subset of which have been linked to clinical cases smith et al 2014 globally o157 is the serotype most commonly associated with human cases and outbreaks with additional serogroups i e non o157 increasingly reported as pathogens of emerging clinical importance ferens and hovde 2011 gould et al 2013 luna gierke et al 2014 baranzoni et al 2016 vtec enteritis comprises a wide range of symptoms from mild uncomplicated infection in healthy adults to severe haemorrhagic diarrhea and colitis among vulnerable sub populations newell and la ragione 2018 potential sequalae include haemolytic uraemic syndrome hus renal failure and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ttp all of which can prove fatal in a minority 3 10 of cases rahal et al 2015 vtec transmission is often zoonotic occurring via the fecal oral route with cattle the most frequently reported animal reservoir but also potentially including other domesticated animals and wildlife farrokh et al 2012 ahmed et al 2015 penakalapati et al 2017 the organism is characterized by a relatively small infectious threshold dose id50 100 cells with human infection in developed regions typically associated with consumption of contaminated water or food croxen et al 2013 saxena et al 2015 accordingly vtec enteritis represents a major global public health concern albeit the global human health burden remains largely unknown due to the lack of comprehensive confirmed infection data accredited to limited and or resource constrained surveillance systems in developing regions as well as underdiagnoses among healthy populations croxen et al 2013 rivas et al 2016 newell and la ragione 2018 delahoy et al 2018 available estimates which are conservative and likely a significant underestimate place the global burden of vtec infection at 2 8 million cases per annum in concurrence with 3890 cases of hus 270 cases of renal disease and 230 deaths majowicz et al 2014 since being recognised as an etiological agent in waterborne outbreaks in the early 1990s dev et al 1991 swerdlow et al 1992 vtec and particularly serogroup o157 have been implicated in both sporadic cases and outbreaks of waterborne gastrointestinal infection via consumption from contaminated drinking water sources muniesa et al 2006 luna gierke et al 2014 saxena et al 2015 garvey et al 2016 ecdc 2019 surface water is generally considered significantly more susceptible to pathogen ingress moreira and bondelind 2017 conversely groundwater resources are often traditionally and erroneously perceived as an inherently microbiologically safe source of water for domestic usage due to natural attenuation processes afforded by overlying contiguous sub soil layers bain et al 2014 murphy et al 2017 however over the past decade a newfound emphasis has been placed on the importance of groundwater as a transmission pathway for waterborne enteric infection bradford and harvey 2017 vtec strains have been reported in groundwater supplies and linked with multiple groundwater related outbreaks muniesa et al 2006 hynds et al 2014a guzman herrador et al 2015 saxena et al 2015 murphy et al 2017 moreira and bondelind 2017 for example the walkerton ontario canada multi etiological outbreak was positively associated with a contaminated municipal groundwater supply causing 2300 acute clinical cases and 7 deaths with e coli o157 h7 identified as one of two pathogens responsible hrudey et al 2003 to date no global effort to ascertain the extent of vtec prevalence in domestic i e intended for human use consumption groundwater supplies and subsequent human exposure has been undertaken these data are fundamental to accurately determine the exposures and public health burden attributable to groundwater sources contaminated by vtec murphy et al 2017 newell and la ragione 2018 an improved understanding of groundwater borne vtec is critically important considering our reliance on groundwater systems as a water resource 95 of global freshwater reserves 2 2 billion daily consumers bradford and harvey 2017 murphy et al 2017 cuthbert et al 2019 accordingly the current study sought to conduct a comprehensive analysis of international peer reviewed literature to i identify the global occurrence of vtec in domestic groundwater supplies and ii identify and categorize extra local risk factors e g infrastructural environmental socioeconomic associated with vtec contamination study findings may be used to enhance the accuracy and consequent efficacy of predictive environmental fate modeling and human exposure risk assessment of the health risks associated with water consumption from groundwater sources in particular robust figures of groundwater vtec prevalence are fundamental in the formulation of quantitative microbial risk assessments qmra cf haas et al 1999 a tool employed in the assessment of

2 1 primary research question and literature review protocol the literature review protocol was developed based upon several previous investigations sargeant et al 2006 graham and polizzotto 2013 hynds et al 2014a andrade et al 2018 chique et al 2020 with the following research question established to direct the review protocol what is the global prevalence of verotoxigenic e coli vtec in domestic groundwater supply sources and what extra local risk factors are associated with vtec contamination scopus and web of science databases were employed as the primary bibliographic sources for identification of relevant studies all database literature searches were conducted on july 1st 2019 employing boolean positional operators and or adj in conjunction with custom search terms table s1 search terms were nested according to specific categories deriving from the population agent outcome pao model hynds et al 2014a a number of trial mock search iterations were used to assess the validity and accuracy of search terms employed with the inclusion of outcome terminology e g ingress contamination pollution significantly restricting the volume of retrieved database records 40 accordingly a modified version of the pao model excluding the outcome category and associated search terms was adopted 2 2 screening phases article selection and identification of additional literature four primary phases were employed for record screening suitability assessment and study exclusion inclusion fig 1 overall a total of 444 records were retrieved from bibliographic database searches with subsequent de duplication decreasing this number to 302 phase 1 a set of eligibility criteria table s2 guided subsequent record exclusion phases phase 2 3 in the first instance each record was subject to title and abstract screening with article selection based on eligibility criteria phase 2 subsequently phase 3 consisted of full text screening of forward selected articles from phase 2 with exclusion of non original and full text research articles e g literature reviews conference proceedings and those identified as unsuitable as per additional eligibility criteria in phase 3 uncertainty in terms of article inclusion n 13 112 11 6 was resolved through all researchers based on established aims and objectives the review protocol exclusively focused on investigations analysing typical infrastructure used to source groundwater e g boreholes artesian wells drilled wells specifically exclusion criteria included i short communications and other non original research articles e g literature reviews ii articles wholly or partially based on previously published data iii investigations failing to explicitly describe vtec groundwater occurrence and or not reporting the number of contaminated groundwater samples or sources iv studies analysing water supplies in which groundwater is mixed with any other water source s e g surface water and v studies either in situ or ex situ incorporating experimental methodologies e g tracer soil column studies or based on non typical groundwater infrastructure e g river bank filtration infiltration galleries which fail to reflect natural vtec groundwater prevalence additional relevant articles not identified through the developed protocol were captured through manual screening of the bibliography of selected records incorporated into the review protocol phase 1 3 i e snowball approach fig 1 the latter included bibliographic screening of academic reviews and gray literature identified independently or in phase 1 2 as well as full text articles analysed in phase 3 furthermore the cite by tool provided by google scholar was used to identify all articles citing each of the records previously screened in phase 3 all newly identified records n 19 were then subject to screening procedures described for phase 2 3 fig 1 2 3 data categories and field extraction six primary data field categories were established to compartmentalize data extraction a list of data extraction fields comprising each of the six categories is provided in table s3 n 41 in all instances a not reported field label was assigned if relevant data were absent and or ambiguously reported table s3 a modified version of the world health organization who regional classification system who 2019 was used to allocate studies to a corresponding geographical region n 7 similarly mean income level and climate followed classification guidelines provided by the united nations un r 2017 and peel et al 2007 köppen geiger system respectively if reported climate allocation was based on specific location s with large scale e g regional national studies incorporating multiple climates assigned an unknown classification where possible reported sampling periods were compared with averaged monthly precipitation data from records extracted from the nearest available weather station the world meteorological organization wmo global database was used to find representative weather stations http worldweather wmo int wmo s 2020 with each investigation allocated a tentative category relative to averaged local precipitation statistics i e high low as such precipitation classifications were relative to local monthly records in order to gain insights into the potential influence of seasonal livestock management e g summer grazing on vtec prevalence investigations from higher latitudes i e temperate and cold climates were discretized where summer sample collection was specified in their experimental designs investigations based in tropical climates were omitted from summer classifications and reported as not available local settlement patterns classified as rural urban and mixed i e peri urban were based on available descriptions and specific study location s provided additionally the rural category was sub divided according to the reported primary agricultural focus i fresh produce e g fruits vegetables grains and ii livestock dairy production generally groundwater supply type and or accompanying infrastructural descriptions were largely ambiguous accordingly an attempt was made to tentatively classify groundwater sources into two main categories based on available groundwater supply descriptions and inferred levels of construction integrity and protection viz bain et al 2014 chique et al 2020 these two consisted of hand dug unimproved groundwater supplies typically associated with lower levels of construction design and boreholes protected which are presumed to afford higher levels of structural protection each investigation was classified according to the reported sampling point namely i direct groundwater source e g well tap or ii point of use e g household tap a number of investigations n 5 collected groundwater samples of varying water volume accordingly in each instance sample volume allocation followed the minimum of the reported volume range vtec detection methods employed included either amplification of verocytotoxin gene markers stx1 stx2 culture based presumptive e coli o157 detection or a combination of both methods i e presumptive followed by molecular confirmation subject to specific pcr assay methodology a range of additional virulence genes markers e g eae hlya rfbe were also targeted and employed in vtec sample detection overall prevalence figures provided within are based in a combination of pcr based vtec and presumptive e coli o157 identification where reported the number of positive groundwater samples of both generic e coli and vtec were extracted from reviewed studies as such e coli vtec detection ratios were calculated according to different and relevant data extraction categories e g study location sampling strategy investigations seeking to establish links between potential environmental vtec reservoirs and groundwater contamination using strain typing tools were also incorporated into the data extraction protocol the two techniques employed were pulsed field gel electrophoresis pfge and multiple locus variable number tandem repeat vntr analysis mlva molecular typing groundwater contamination mechanisms were inferred from available study descriptions if any with four main groundwater contamination categories employed lee 2005 hynds et al 2012 andrade et al 2018 chique et al 2020 including i direct surface ingress consisting of contaminants entering groundwater supply units via surface structural components wellhead ii groundwater recharge or sub soil layer filtration migration of surface borne contaminants and eventual groundwater deposition iii direct underground migration i e groundwater contamination originating from sources below soil surface e g septic tanks iv inter aquifer exchange comprising contamination of groundwater exclusively through hydraulic interconnectivity similarly contamination sources were grouped into two main categories human e g domestic wastewater and animal 3 results 3 1 included studies geography local environments and inconsistent reporting the review protocol identified 23 studies that complied with all inclusion criteria fig 1 table s1 a synthesis of extracted and collated data across data field categories is provided in table s3 a lack of consistent and or ambiguous reporting was observed among all established data extraction categories and was particularly prevalent in terms of structural descriptions of groundwater supply sources surveyed table s3 specifically 65 2 of studies 15 23 included no extractable data for any pre established infrastructural data fields overly generic structural supply unit descriptions e g well depth were observed in 17 4 4 23 of studies in turn just two studies explicitly reported comprehensive infrastructural data in relation to analysed groundwater supply units pitkänen et al 2011 ferguson et al 2012 similarly absent and or ambiguous reporting was a consistent feature with regard to hydro geological setting with just 5 studies providing a relevant description table 1 the review dataset spans a period of 16 years 2003 to 2019 with a majority of studies 13 23 56 6 published during the 6 year period 2014 2019 table 1 the geographical distribution of reviewed studies including country specific vtec sample supply detection rates are presented in

the 2471 analysed groundwater samples investigations from south east asia 43 2 and north america 30 4 comprised approximately three quarters 1819 2471 73 6 studies conducted in countries characterised by a high mean income comprised half of the dataset 12 23 52 5 with most groundwater samples also deriving from this category 1668 2471 67 5 a comparable number of investigations were conducted in lower middle 6 23 26 1 and upper middle 5 23 21 7 income categories investigations based in rural settings were predominant 14 23 60 9 and comprised approximately half of groundwater samples analysed 1295 2471 52 4 specifically within the rural category four 17 4 and three 13 investigations were based in agricultural environments primarily focusing on fresh produce and livestock production respectively studies conducted in mixed i e peri urban settings accounted for 4 23 17 4 of reviewed investigations identified studies based on urban settings were less common 3 23 13 the intersection between geographical study location income category and local setting is presented in fig 3 all investigations conducted in upper middle economies originated from sub saharan africa primarily due to the high aggregation of studies conducted in south africa n 5 fig 2 most investigations conducted in high income countries were based in rural environments 10 12 83 3 fig 3 3 2 study design climate and seasonality the dataset largely comprised investigations focusing on groundwater vtec prevalence 21 23 91 3 in contrast to those prompted by outbreaks of infection 2 23 8 7 table 1 the two infection related investigations derived from outbreaks associated with i consumption of bagged spinach in the usa and canada jay et al 2007 and ii drinking water in a school camp in south korea park et al 2018 studies more frequently originated from high latitudes fig 2 resulting in the predominance of temperate 10 23 43 5 and cold 4 23 17 4 climatic classifications table 1 single or one off sampling regimes accounted for 15 23 65 2 of studies and 1638 2471 66 3 of analysed samples respectively more than half of identified investigations 13 23 56 5 comprised sample collection during sampling months characterized by high local precipitation the latter is sub divided into investigations fully conducted within periods of inferred high precipitation 7 23 30 4 and those incorporating both high and low precipitation sampling periods 6 23 26 1 however a substantial number of investigations provided insufficient information relating to employed sampling regime thus precluding integration of sampling months and averaged monthly precipitation 9 23 39 1 temporally 2 23 8 7 sampling campaigns were restricted to a short one month period with longer sampling campaigns lasting 2 months 15 23 65 2 more frequently employed table 1 additionally most studies adopted sampling designs incorporating analysis of 11 groundwater sources 17 23 73 9 table 1 similarly investigations focusing on 51 groundwater samples were prevalent 14 23 60 8 fig 4 summarizes the scale of sampling design employed among investigations excluding those failing to report sampling campaign duration n 6 3 3 groundwater supply characteristics and detection methods approximately half of the identified studies focused on groundwater supplies classified as serving an individual household i e privately

categorized as hand dug wells only featured in two investigations few investigations reported vtec analysis on groundwater samples which were subject to treatment e g chemical physical n 3 however several studies failed to describe if a treatment system was employed n 10 as shown table 1 there was a tendency for investigations to adhere to source sample collection points with supplies directly sampled in 11 23 47 8 investigations conversely collection of samples from a domestic tap i e following distribution was reported in 4 23 17 4 studies approximately half of reviewed studies based vtec analysis on sample volumes of 100 250 ml 11 23 47 8 with the preferred method employed for sample concentration being membrane filtration 16 23 69 6 molecular identification comprising pcr was the favoured detection method 19 23 82 6 application of quantitative pcr was limited to 3 19 15 9 investigations in total 14 19 73 4 investigations employed pcr on e coli previously isolated through culture enrichment a subset of pcr based studies incorporated pcr analysis of all groundwater samples collected 5 19 26 3 overall application of vtec serotype typing tools to identify potential environmental sources was infrequently employed 3 23 13 table 1 3 4 generic e coli and vtec detection rates vtec was cultured and or genetic markers stx1 stx2 identified in 9 23 39 1 studies with overall sample and source specific detection rates of 0 6 16 2471 and 1 3 25 1998 respectively the unexpected higher number of positive supply sources in contrast to groundwater samples stems from the prevalence of inconsistent reporting in the review dataset with several investigations failing to specify source sample vtec detection rates table s3 based on positive pcr detection in 8 19 42 1 reviewed studies gene detection was reported in 0 8 4 477 of groundwater samples and 6 9 34 493 supplies analysed table 1 a single study employing culture based methods reported positive

groundwater sample detection rates of generic e coli and vtec according to study sampling strategy one off and repeat are presented in fig 5 pooled study data indicates a generic e coli groundwater sample detection rate of 315 1926 16 4 fig 5a notwithstanding a total of 7 23 30 4 investigations did not explicitly report the study specific generic e coli detection rate again this lack of reporting was associated with ambiguous incomplete data collation and or presentation 4 23 17 or was related to investigations not employing e coli as a groundwater fecal indicator organism fio i e direct vtec detection 3 23 13 overall a vtec to generic e coli sample detection ratio of 15 152 9 9 was estimated fig 5a additionally vtec generic e coli specific to repeat and one off investigations of 16 7 and 7 5 were estimated fig 5 in terms of geographic vtec generic e coli detection ratios europe 19 2 and north america 17 5 exhibited the highest values table 3 pooled vtec detection rates for groundwater samples and groundwater supply sources of 0 7 16 2230 and 1 3 25 1949 were calculated respectively similar to generic e coli incidence several investigations failed to report sufficient data to calculate vtec detection rates specifically 5 9 55 6 vtec positive studies failed to specify the number of contaminated groundwater samples fig 5a likewise 3 9 33 3 investigations did not report the number of sampled groundwater supplies 3 5 potential drivers of vtec in groundwater geographically highest vtec groundwater detection rates were reported in sub saharan africa 10 152 6 6 table 2 this feature is clearly reflected in country specific data fig 2 with south africa reporting the highest vtec supply detection rates 8 5 a local study abia et al 2017 reported the highest vtec dataset prevalence with respect to groundwater supplies 9 18 50 in turn won et al 2013 reported the highest sample detection rate 7 180 3 9 among dairy farm environments in ohio usa high groundwater supply detection rates in sub saharan africa influence the high values observed in upper middle income categories 10 130 7 7 table 2 fig 3 extracted data also indicate urban and peri urban environments had higher supply vtec contamination rates at 5 4 and 4 9 respectively conversely rural settings had lower pooled vtec supply sample detection rates of 0 7 and 0 9 respectively climate trends indicate environments classified as temperate 14 554 2 5 and cold 8 392 2 accounted for a majority of contaminated supply sources estimates likely constrained by the high latitude focus of studies comprising the dataset table 1 conversely no vtec were reported in the single data reporting investigation based in arid environments within the context of supply regulation management public supplies n 2 exhibited no contamination in contrast to those under private or alternate i e mixed administration table 2 overall private i e unregulated groundwater samples 15 800 1 9 and supplies 15 631 2 4 were characterised by the highest vtec detection rates moreover while the number of investigations explicitly focusing on hand dug supplies was low n 2 higher supply detection rates were calculated 9 40 22 5 in comparison to supply sources classified as protected 11 1137 1 assessing the potential nexus between seasonality and sampling design investigations focusing sampling efforts during periods of normally high precipitation reported higher detection rates for both groundwater samples 15 683 2 2 and supplies 15 649 2 3 relative to low precipitation periods where there was no reported detection across samples or sources table 2 the two investigations based on temporally limited sampling campaigns 1 month reported the highest sample supply vtec prevalence 6 and 7 8 respectively similarly vtec source detection rates were higher 10 in studies characterized by a more limited scope in terms of the number of sampled groundwater supplies n 10 pooled data indicate comparable groundwater source detection rates among investigations focusing on 10 20 3 1 and 51 150 3 7 groundwater samples investigations incorporating repeated sampling regimes reported higher vtec supply detection rates 13 324 4 than one off investigations 12 1420 0 8 table 2 similarly as shown in fig 5 higher sample detection rates for generic e coli were reported in repeated 151 711 21 2 compared with one off 176 1440 12 2 investigations an overall adjusted vtec generic e coli detection ratio of 5 30 16 7 was calculated to account for the potential effects of repeat sampling on groundwater sample detection overall identification and attribution of contamination mechanisms pathways and sources were often absent and or subject to very ambiguous reporting only 3 9 33 3 investigations reporting positive vtec detection described potential ingress mechanism s table 4 specifically groundwater recharge and direct surface ingress were the primary ingress mechanisms suggested with each featuring in two investigations albeit largely based on tentative attribution table 4 reported presumptive contamination sources were evenly distributed among animal and human categories 5 6 83 3 with cattle the only specific source potentially linked to vtec groundwater supply contamination 3 5 60 table 4 in turn human contamination sources were often vaguely associated with domestic waste effluents with pit latrines explicitly linked with vtec supply ingress in 2 5 40 investigations contamination source attribution was primarily based on source proximity adjacency a total of 2 3 investigations employing environmental vtec strain typing reported the presence of vtec through comparison of pfge patterns obtained from human stool samples and drinking water isolates park et al 2018 identified groundwater as the most likely source of a multiple diarrhoeagenic e coli outbreak vtec epec similarly schets et al 2005 compared e coli o157 pfge patterns from groundwater isolates with collated records from different potential regional sources identifying cattle as the likely contamination source beyond select investigations focusing on specific agricultural settings n 7 most investigations had a broad i e landscape wide approach towards vtec detection without any reported explicit contamination sources table 1 2 a total of 5 8 62 5 pcr based investigations with positive vtec detection specified the serogroups identified with only o157 n 4 and o103 n 1 reported table 4 4 discussion 4 1 generic e coli and vtec detection ratios to the authors knowledge the current study represents the first attempt to globally quantify vtec incidence in groundwater supplies as such one of the key deliverables emanating from this investigation are estimated generic e coli vtec detection ratios fig 5 with potential bespoke applications in groundwater management the presented figures may be applicable for development of increasingly accurate qmra specifically focusing on domestic groundwater supplies haas et al 1999 primarily as a pathogen contribution or loading metric i e model input specific to groundwater borne vtec to date development of qmra for estimating the burden of groundwater borne vtec has largely relied on e coli e coli o157 ratios estimated from a range of environmental waters e g haas et al 1999 soller et al 2010 hence it may be contended that the presented ratios provide a more specific representation of vtec incidence in groundwater environments notwithstanding it is critical to highlight the potential influence of selective sampling on estimated values fig 5 key data trends e g sampling period number of supplies analysed suggest that studies with more inclusive i e random rather than targeted sampling designs frequently convey lower levels of vtec detection table 2 and as such the likelihood of bias introduced by targeting susceptible supplies i e proof of concept is emphasized and potentially compounded by publication bias i e failure to publish negative results identified as a key feature in a range of recent literature compilations with similar scope hynds et al 2014a andrade et al 2018 l 2020 chique et al 2020 there is sufficient evidence to suggest that sampling bias is somewhat ubiquitous within the microbial groundwater contamination literature a factor which may compromise the integrity of estimates presented herein arguably the ratio estimated from studies adopting repeat sampling 16 7 may provide a more realistic estimate of generic e coli presence and concurrent vtec incidence in groundwater as such the calculated repeat value likely represents a more robust metric which can be applied to accurately discern human vtec exposure over time evidently the latter is expected to exhibit natural temporal variation with the repeat ratio presented perhaps best representative of an annual mean based on the reported distribution of sampling periods table 2 generic e coli vtec ratios deriving from repeat investigations are also less compromised by incomplete reporting which potentially reinforces the cogency of estimated values fig 5 previous qmras focusing on domestic water distribution systems e g howard et al 2006 katukiza et al 2013 machdar et al 2013 abia et al 2016 have employed an e coli vtec detection rate of 8 viz haas et al 1999 also employed for e coli epec shresta et al s 2017 and comparable with the low range presented in this investigation 7 5 9 9 fig 5 in turn hynds et al 2014b use the lower bound probabilistic range of 1 16 as reported by soller et al 2010 from untreated drinking water the latter exhibits some agreement with the estimated 16 7 ratio based on repeat sampling fig 5b while available figures are comparable the likelihood of estimated e coli and vtec values being inflated as a result of selective sampling needs to be highlighted clearly the lack of clear and homogeneous reporting relating to both e coli and vtec groundwater sample detection fig 5 table 2 represents a critical limitation among identified studies 4 2 vtec groundwater incidence and geographical data trends pooled review data were used to establish vtec groundwater sample supply detection rates of 0 7 and 1 3 respectively the unexpected lower detection rates estimated for groundwater samples in contrast to supplies are an artefact of inconsistent reporting of vtec detection among investigations table s3 in light of the potential effects of selective sampling and likelihood of figure inflation it is argued that values deriving from investigations employing repeat sampling designs 1 4 table 2 provide more robust vtec prevalence estimates which are potentially representative of global contamination baselines notably a recent investigation stokdyk et al 2020 not included in the review dataset published outside review period reporting on a comprehensive number of groundwater samples n 834 and supplies n 145 identified comparable vtec sample detection rates 0 4 to those presented here analogous values may serve to support presented vtec detection rates however this study was both geographically restricted and exclusively focused on public supplies with any comparisons thus requiring careful interpretation overall the low number of investigations identified n 23 and relatively limited number of groundwater samples supplies comprising the review dataset table 1 represent both a key finding and research gap considering i the importance of vtec as a globally significant waterborne pathogen and concomitant clinical burden and ii reported links between groundwater resources and risk of human infection muniesa et al 2006 majowicz et al 2014 guzman herrador et al 2015 moreira and bondelind 2017 similarly the lack of robust data on vtec serotype prevalence in groundwater wells table 4 constitutes another important finding particularly considering the increasingly reported global incidence and clinical burden of non o157 serotypes and potential for regional serotype variability gould et al 2013 luna gierke et al 2014 baranzoni et al 2016 geographically the review dataset was characterized by key regional data knowledge gaps fig 2 the lack of regional data represents a crucial limitation accounting for both reported geographical variations in notified vtec infections and potential influence of local regional risk factors croxen et al 2013 newell and la ragione 2018 regional e coli and vtec incidence data are essential for deriving geographically specific information and distributions for example murphy et al 2016 pooled available data from two north american studies to produce custom qmra health risk assessments for canadian groundwater supplies despite the poor geographical distribution encountered and prospective bias in source selection some of the collated regional figures and generic e coli vtec ratios may find useful application in future investigations table 2 3 fig 2 4 3 local environments settlement patterns and land use emphasizing the importance of local risk factors is key considering higher vtec groundwater supply detection rates in urban 5 4 and mixed 4 9 settings table 2 to an extent findings exhibit a disparity with available geostatistical evidence linking vtec prevalence with rural environments in high income regions schets et al 2005 denno et al 2009 óhaiseadha et al 2017 brehony et al 2018 notably the majority of reviewed investigations based in urban and mixed settings were concentrated in lower income regions in asia and sub saharan africa fig 3 available evidence from sub saharan africa highlights the intensity of peri urban animal rearing the prevalence of domestic wastewater sources incidence of zoonotic vtec strains and high contamination burden on groundwater resources kulabako et al 2007 adelana et al 2008 braune and xu 2010 lupindu et al 2014 lapworth et al 2017 notably in terms of cattle management practices barn feedlot confinement as opposed to traditional pastoral i e free roaming rearing has been associated with lower vtec environmental prevalence in developing countries callaway et al 2009 smith et al 2011 however considering spatial contiguity presented results suggest that a diffuse livestock source distribution and the associated potential for close interaction with groundwater supplies receptor increase the likelihood of supply pathogenic contamination and human vtec exposure highlighted geographical and land use trends may also reflect the regional importance of manure application land spreading in agriculture a potentially key conduit for environmental vtec dissemination fremaux et al 2008 ferens and hovde 2011 van elsas et al 2011 however detailed data on manure soil application rates at a global scale are not available with any conjectures made on the geographical influence of soil manure on estimated vtec prevalence subject to speculation investigations based in agricultural environments focusing on fresh produce n 4 reported no positive vtec detections table 2 with a calculated fio e coli sample detection rate of 11 7 18 154 results are relevant in light of global evidence for microbial contamination in produce growing regions and the potential for pathogen propagation via fresh produce e g german sprout outbreak ca 2011 buchholz et al 2011 pachepsky et al 2011 nguyen the et al 2016 in particular due to its zoonotic origin enhanced survival capacity in soil water and high prevalence in farming environments vtec is a leading etiological agent of outbreaks linked to the consumption of fresh produce olaimat and holley 2012 lal et al 2012 jung et al 2014 conversely studies based in rural environments with an explicit focus on cattle rearing exhibited higher vtec detection rates in comparison to other rural sub categories table 2 however two investigations of supplies located adjacent to concentrated animal feeding operations cafos economides et al 2012 li et al 2015 reported positive fio e coli groundwater sample detection 8 6 but no vtec contamination similarly joung et al 2013 analysed groundwater wells in relation to confined livestock carcass burial sites all samples analysed n 627 were negative for vtec with rates of generic e coli contamination calculated at 7 3 the results presented seem to support the aforementioned inferences relating to the spatial distribution i e confinement of potential vtec sources and decreased likelihood of groundwater supply contamination 4 4 potential influence of climate and seasonality although based on limited data both in frequency and scope summary statistics highlight the potential influence of temperate and cold climatic settings on higher rates of vtec supply incidence 2 2 5 table 2 pooled data may at times discreetly reflect the cumulative effects of lower temperatures reduced ultraviolet uv solar radiation and higher precipitation on vtec survival transport and thus environmental prevalence there is substantial evidence within the literature supporting enhanced extra host e coli and vtec survival at lower temperatures 10 c in both environmental and potable water soils plant material cattle feces and derived effluents e g manure slurry john and rose 2005 fremaux et al 2008 ma et al 2011 van elsas et al 2011 generally increased stress and energy expenditure associated with higher temperatures limits e coli persistence in the environment with large amplitude oscillations 7 c particularly impacting e coli survival semenov et al 2007 previous experiments conducted on natural well water indicate increased vtec survival at 5 10 c rice et al 1992 watterworth et al 2006 collated data trends may also be partially due to reduced levels of solar uv radiation in temperate and cold settings increasing vtec prevalence in soils surface water and manures prior to mobilization to subsoils and groundwater lejeune et al 2001 yaun et al 2003 2004 fremaux et al 2008 additionally the effects of high rainfall on the release and propagation of fecal material and bacteria through enhanced landscape hydrological connectivity e g overland flow have been well substantiated fremaux et al 2008 hofstra 2011 mccarthy et al 2012 blaustein et al 2016 unsurprisingly vtec outbreaks have been frequently linked with periods of heavy antecedent rainfall muniesa et al 2006 o dwyer et al 2016 these effects are suggested via higher vtec sample supply detection rates calculated from investigations focusing on periods of high precipitation 2 table 2 e coli have also been shown to benefit from anaerobic and microaerobic conditions provided by moist or waterlogged environments often found in wet temperate settings fremaux et al 2008 brennan et al 2010 van elsas et al 2011 4 5 contamination sources pathways and hydrogeology reviewed investigations also alluded to the potential relevance of human contamination sources and specifically latrines with the exception of one study won et al 2013 all investigations align contamination sources with human origin derived from lower income settings n 4 thus reinforcing the potential underlying role of socioeconomic drivers graham and polizzotto 2013 just three investigations reported potential ingress mechanisms table 4 all of which were largely grounded on inconclusive evidence representing a critical knowledge gap a major methodological limitation precluding accurate identification of vtec contamination sources was the lack of molecular vtec strain typing employed in reviewed studies e g pfge mlva table 1 a significant majority of studies tentatively identified vtec sources based on proximity rather than employing dna typing to effectively link source s and receptor s thus representing a key implication for the applicability of reported data as such while cattle are generally reported as a major source of environmental vtec their importance as a reservoir in developing regions in the absence of data is more uncertain mainga et al 2018 accordingly other key animal or human vtec reservoirs may remain unaccounted for ferens and hovde 2011 ahmed et al 2015 in general an integrative research approach aimed at identifying vtec contamination sources pathways and potential risk factors is often superseded by a focus on quantifying vtec environmental prevalence this feature is also reflected in the recurrent omission of local hydro geological characteristics table 1 accounting for the influence of parent materials on key sub soil characteristics e g porosity permeability and in turn e coli survival and transport i e retention filtration study area hydrogeological setting represents a pivotal driver fremaux et al 2008 bolster et al 2009 van elsas et al 2011 however a limited number of investigations provided relevant hydrogeological descriptions 5 23 21 7 ferguson et al 2012 associated local geology with vtec groundwater contamination through provision of evidence based links between shallow unconfined sandy aquifers rainfall intensity and efficient groundwater recharge similarly li et al 2015 attributed unsaturated alluvial sediment soil layers 3 30 m with a high pollutant attenuation capacity and mitigation of vtec transport to groundwater additional investigations reporting hydrogeological data did not directly address the potential relevance in terms of vtec incidence incorporation of hydrogeological parameters as potential risk factors in future investigations is thus strongly advised 4 6 groundwater supply type infrastructure and administration with noted exceptions e g ferguson et al 2012 a significant majority of reviewed investigations failed to describe sample collection protocols and wellhead characteristics e g tap pump allowing for discrimination of the effects if any of supply design construction on vtec incidence moreover descriptions of source structural components e g well casing seal and other key features e g depth age were also largely absent from reviewed investigations table s3 this represents an impediment to identifying risk factors pertaining to vtec supply ingress and inappropriate faulty structural components ferguson et al 2012 have identified increased supply depth as a determining factor limiting vtec contamination attributed to effective pathogen attenuation with increasing soil depth despite its potential importance only 3 23 13 studies explicitly reported groundwater supply depth li et al 2015 failed to detect vtec irrespective of groundwater well depth while won et al 2013 found no association between well depth and vtec contamination citing inadequate private supply maintenance as a possible mechanism for vtec ingress the influence of varying levels of supply maintenance regulation and surveillance are potentially reflected in the higher vtec detection values estimated for private supplies table 2 in contrast to public municipal supplies which are generally managed by local regional regulatory authorities and often comprise water treatment systems private supplies are largely unregulated and untreated and as such more likely subject to inadequate maintenance and microbiological contamination hexemer et al 2008 kreutswiser et al r 2011 daniels et al 2016 fox et al 2016 review findings thus contribute to a growing body of evidence emphasizing the potential transmission of enteric pathogens and human exposure through private groundwater supplies hynds et al 2014a wallender et al 2014 murphy et al 2017 additionally higher vtec detection rates among private supplies may also point to the prevalence of direct source contamination rather than widespread or aquifer wide groundwater pollution pooled data based on inferred levels of supply construction and integrity indicate hand dug supplies had elevated vtec detection rates 22 5 table 2 however findings require careful interpretation as they largely reflect detection levels reported in a single study abia et al 2017 only two investigations explicitly analysed hand dug groundwater supplies both deriving from sub saharan africa accordingly any assessment of risk factors associated with supplies and levels of protection are precluded by i vague descriptions of groundwater supplies ii tentative nature of supply classifications employed and iii low number of identified investigations explicitly analysing unimproved supplies n 2 5 conclusion and recommendations presented herein is the first global scoping review of the presence of verotoxigenic e coli vtec in groundwater sources intended for human consumption overall a vtec to generic e coli sample detection ratio of 15 152 9 9 was derived from reviewed investigations providing a baseline for vtec in e coli contaminated groundwater sources based on the relatively low number of identified investigations prevalence of inconsistent reporting and limited amount of data comprising the review dataset a major recommendation deriving from this investigation is the pressing need for additional field based studies data on vtec prevalence in groundwater systems additional data is essential to improve established vtec groundwater contamination baselines and accurately identify extra local contamination risk factors which are in turn necessary to inform relevant multi disciplinary stakeholders including groundwater consumers public health authorities and regulatory bodies environmental managers and hydrogeologists similarly investigations deriving from geographically diverse settings are required to obtain insights data applicable within different hydro geological climatic and local settlement urban rural contexts the following bespoke guidelines

17391,verocytotoxin producing e coli vtec are important agents of diarrhoeal disease in humans globally as a noted waterborne disease emphasis has been given to the study vtec in surface waters readily susceptible to microbial contamination conversely the status of vtec in potable groundwater sources generally regarded as a safe drinking water supply remains largely understudied as such this investigation presents the first scoping review seeking to determine the global prevalence of vtec in groundwater supply sources intended for human consumption twenty three peer reviewed studies were identified and included for data extraction groundwater sample and supply detection rates estimated 0 6 and 1 3 respectively indicate vtec is infrequently present in domestic groundwater sources however where generic fecal indicator e coli are present the vtec to e coli ratio was found to be 9 9 representing a latent health concern for groundwater consumers geographically extracted data indicates higher vtec detection rates in urban 5 4 and peri urban 4 9 environments than in rural areas 0 9 however this finding is confounded by the predominance of research studies in lower income regions climate trends indicate local environments classified as temperate 14 554 2 5 and cold 8 392 2 accounted for a majority of supply sources with vtec present with similar detection rates encountered among supplies sampled during periods typically characterized by high precipitation 15 649 2 3 proposed prevalence figures may find application in preventive risk based catchment and groundwater quality management including development of quantitative microbial risk assessments qmra notwithstanding to an extent a large geographical disparity in available investigations lack of standardized reporting and bias in source selection restrict the transferability of research findings overall the mechanisms responsible for vtec transport and ingress into groundwater supplies remain ambiguous representing a critical knowledge gap and denoting a distinctive lack of integration between hydrogeological and public health research key recommendations and guidelines are provided for prospective studies directed at increasingly integrative and multi disciplinary research graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction at present six e coli pathotypes collectively known

lesions in the host manifesting as gastrointestinal disease croxen et al 2013 over 400 vtec serotypes have been identified a subset of which have been linked to clinical cases smith et al 2014 globally o157 is the serotype most commonly associated with human cases and outbreaks with additional serogroups i e non o157 increasingly reported as pathogens of emerging clinical importance ferens and hovde 2011 gould et al 2013 luna gierke et al 2014 baranzoni et al 2016 vtec enteritis comprises a wide range of symptoms from mild uncomplicated infection in healthy adults to severe haemorrhagic diarrhea and colitis among vulnerable sub populations newell and la ragione 2018 potential sequalae include haemolytic uraemic syndrome hus renal failure and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ttp all of which can prove fatal in a minority 3 10 of cases rahal et al 2015 vtec transmission is often zoonotic occurring via the fecal oral route with cattle the most frequently reported animal reservoir but also potentially including other domesticated animals and wildlife farrokh et al 2012 ahmed et al 2015 penakalapati et al 2017 the organism is characterized by a relatively small infectious threshold dose id50 100 cells with human infection in developed regions typically associated with consumption of contaminated water or food croxen et al 2013 saxena et al 2015 accordingly vtec enteritis represents a major global public health concern albeit the global human health burden remains largely unknown due to the lack of comprehensive confirmed infection data accredited to limited and or resource constrained surveillance systems in developing regions as well as underdiagnoses among healthy populations croxen et al 2013 rivas et al 2016 newell and la ragione 2018 delahoy et al 2018 available estimates which are conservative and likely a significant underestimate place the global burden of vtec infection at 2 8 million cases per annum in concurrence with 3890 cases of hus 270 cases of renal disease and 230 deaths majowicz et al 2014 since being recognised as an etiological agent in waterborne outbreaks in the early 1990s dev et al 1991 swerdlow et al 1992 vtec and particularly serogroup o157 have been implicated in both sporadic cases and outbreaks of waterborne gastrointestinal infection via consumption from contaminated drinking water sources muniesa et al 2006 luna gierke et al 2014 saxena et al 2015 garvey et al 2016 ecdc 2019 surface water is generally considered significantly more susceptible to pathogen ingress moreira and bondelind 2017 conversely groundwater resources are often traditionally and erroneously perceived as an inherently microbiologically safe source of water for domestic usage due to natural attenuation processes afforded by overlying contiguous sub soil layers bain et al 2014 murphy et al 2017 however over the past decade a newfound emphasis has been placed on the importance of groundwater as a transmission pathway for waterborne enteric infection bradford and harvey 2017 vtec strains have been reported in groundwater supplies and linked with multiple groundwater related outbreaks muniesa et al 2006 hynds et al 2014a guzman herrador et al 2015 saxena et al 2015 murphy et al 2017 moreira and bondelind 2017 for example the walkerton ontario canada multi etiological outbreak was positively associated with a contaminated municipal groundwater supply causing 2300 acute clinical cases and 7 deaths with e coli o157 h7 identified as one of two pathogens responsible hrudey et al 2003 to date no global effort to ascertain the extent of vtec prevalence in domestic i e intended for human use consumption groundwater supplies and subsequent human exposure has been undertaken these data are fundamental to accurately determine the exposures and public health burden attributable to groundwater sources contaminated by vtec murphy et al 2017 newell and la ragione 2018 an improved understanding of groundwater borne vtec is critically important considering our reliance on groundwater systems as a water resource 95 of global freshwater reserves 2 2 billion daily consumers bradford and harvey 2017 murphy et al 2017 cuthbert et al 2019 accordingly the current study sought to conduct a comprehensive analysis of international peer reviewed literature to i identify the global occurrence of vtec in domestic groundwater supplies and ii identify and categorize extra local risk factors e g infrastructural environmental socioeconomic associated with vtec contamination study findings may be used to enhance the accuracy and consequent efficacy of predictive environmental fate modeling and human exposure risk assessment of the health risks associated with water consumption from groundwater sources in particular robust figures of groundwater vtec prevalence are fundamental in the formulation of quantitative microbial risk assessments qmra cf haas et al 1999 a tool employed in the assessment of

natural engineered eventual human pathogenic exposure and ensuing risk of disease who 2016 today qmras represent one of the leading methods in the characterization of consumer health risks associated

2 1 primary research question and literature review protocol the literature review protocol was developed based upon several previous investigations sargeant et al 2006 graham and polizzotto 2013 hynds et al 2014a andrade et al 2018 chique et al 2020 with the following research question established to direct the review protocol what is the global prevalence of verotoxigenic e coli vtec in domestic groundwater supply sources and what extra local risk factors are associated with vtec contamination scopus and web of science databases were employed as the primary bibliographic sources for identification of relevant studies all database literature searches were conducted on july 1st 2019 employing boolean positional operators and or adj in conjunction with custom search terms table s1 search terms were nested according to specific categories deriving from the population agent outcome pao model hynds et al 2014a a number of trial mock search iterations were used to assess the validity and accuracy of search terms employed with the inclusion of outcome terminology e g ingress contamination pollution significantly restricting the volume of retrieved database records 40 accordingly a modified version of the pao model excluding the outcome category and associated search terms was adopted 2 2 screening phases article selection and identification of additional literature four primary phases were employed for record screening suitability assessment and study exclusion inclusion fig 1 overall a total of 444 records were retrieved from bibliographic database searches with subsequent de duplication decreasing this number to 302 phase 1 a set of eligibility criteria table s2 guided subsequent record exclusion phases phase 2 3 in the first instance each record was subject to title and abstract screening with article selection based on eligibility criteria phase 2 subsequently phase 3 consisted of full text screening of forward selected articles from phase 2 with exclusion of non original and full text research articles e g literature reviews conference proceedings and those identified as unsuitable as per additional eligibility criteria in phase 3 uncertainty in terms of article inclusion n 13 112 11 6 was resolved through all researchers based on established aims and objectives the review protocol exclusively focused on investigations analysing typical infrastructure used to source groundwater e g boreholes artesian wells drilled wells specifically exclusion criteria included i short communications and other non original research articles e g literature reviews ii articles wholly or partially based on previously published data iii investigations failing to explicitly describe vtec groundwater occurrence and or not reporting the number of contaminated groundwater samples or sources iv studies analysing water supplies in which groundwater is mixed with any other water source s e g surface water and v studies either in situ or ex situ incorporating experimental methodologies e g tracer soil column studies or based on non typical groundwater infrastructure e g river bank filtration infiltration galleries which fail to reflect natural vtec groundwater prevalence additional relevant articles not identified through the developed protocol were captured through manual screening of the bibliography of selected records incorporated into the review protocol phase 1 3 i e snowball approach fig 1 the latter included bibliographic screening of academic reviews and gray literature identified independently or in phase 1 2 as well as full text articles analysed in phase 3 furthermore the cite by tool provided by google scholar was used to identify all articles citing each of the records previously screened in phase 3 all newly identified records n 19 were then subject to screening procedures described for phase 2 3 fig 1 2 3 data categories and field extraction six primary data field categories were established to compartmentalize data extraction a list of data extraction fields comprising each of the six categories is provided in table s3 n 41 in all instances a not reported field label was assigned if relevant data were absent and or ambiguously reported table s3 a modified version of the world health organization who regional classification system who 2019 was used to allocate studies to a

respectively if reported climate allocation was based on specific location s with large scale e g regional national studies incorporating multiple climates assigned an unknown classification where possible reported sampling periods were compared with averaged monthly precipitation data from records extracted from the nearest available weather station the world meteorological organization wmo

on available descriptions and specific study location s provided additionally the rural category was sub divided according to the reported primary agricultural focus i fresh produce e g fruits vegetables grains and ii livestock dairy production generally groundwater supply type and or accompanying infrastructural descriptions were largely ambiguous accordingly an attempt was made to tentatively classify groundwater sources into two main categories based on available groundwater supply descriptions and inferred levels of construction integrity and protection viz bain et al 2014 chique et al 2020 these two consisted of hand dug unimproved groundwater supplies typically associated with lower levels of construction design and boreholes protected which are presumed to afford higher levels of structural protection each investigation was classified according to the reported sampling point namely i direct groundwater source e g well tap or ii point of use e g household tap a number of investigations n 5 collected groundwater samples of varying water volume accordingly in each instance sample volume allocation followed the minimum of the reported volume range vtec detection methods employed included either amplification of verocytotoxin gene markers stx1 stx2 culture based presumptive e coli o157 detection or a combination of both methods i e presumptive followed by molecular confirmation subject to specific pcr assay methodology a range of additional virulence genes markers e g eae hlya rfbe were also targeted and employed in vtec sample detection overall prevalence figures provided within are based in a combination of pcr based vtec and presumptive e coli o157 identification where reported the number of positive groundwater samples of both generic e coli and vtec were extracted from reviewed studies as such e coli vtec detection ratios were calculated according to different and relevant data extraction categories e g study location sampling strategy investigations seeking to establish links between potential environmental vtec reservoirs and groundwater contamination using strain typing tools were also incorporated into the data

contamination mechanisms were inferred from available study descriptions if any with four main groundwater contamination categories employed lee 2005 hynds et al 2012 andrade et al 2018 chique et al 2020 including i direct surface ingress consisting of contaminants entering groundwater supply units via surface structural components wellhead ii groundwater recharge or sub soil layer filtration migration of surface borne contaminants and eventual groundwater deposition iii direct underground migration i e groundwater contamination originating from sources below soil surface e g septic tanks iv inter aquifer exchange comprising contamination of groundwater exclusively through hydraulic interconnectivity similarly contamination sources were grouped into two main categories human e g domestic wastewater and animal 3 results 3 1 included studies geography local environments and inconsistent reporting the review protocol identified 23 studies that complied with all inclusion criteria fig 1 table s1 a synthesis of extracted and collated data across data field categories is provided in table s3 a lack of consistent and or ambiguous reporting was observed among all established data extraction categories and was particularly prevalent in terms of structural descriptions of groundwater supply sources surveyed table s3 specifically 65 2 of studies 15 23 included no extractable data for any pre established infrastructural data fields overly generic structural supply unit descriptions e g well depth were observed in 17 4 4 23 of studies in turn just two studies explicitly reported comprehensive infrastructural data in relation to analysed groundwater supply units pitkänen et al 2011 ferguson et al 2012 similarly absent and or ambiguous reporting was a consistent feature with regard to hydro geological setting with just 5 studies providing a relevant description table 1 the review dataset spans a period of 16 years 2003 to 2019 with a majority of studies 13 23 56 6 published during the 6 year period 2014 2019 table 1 the geographical distribution of reviewed studies including country specific vtec sample supply detection rates are presented in fig 2 sub saharan africa was the most frequently featured region with respect to study number 7 23 30 4 followed by south east asia and north america each accounting for 6 23 26 1 studies table 1 of the 2471 analysed groundwater samples investigations from south east asia 43 2 and north america 30 4 comprised approximately three quarters 1819 2471 73 6 studies conducted in countries characterised by a high mean income comprised half of the dataset 12 23 52 5 with most groundwater samples also deriving from this category 1668 2471 67 5 a comparable number of investigations were conducted in lower middle 6 23 26 1 and upper middle 5 23 21 7 income categories investigations based in rural settings were predominant 14 23 60 9 and comprised approximately half of groundwater samples analysed 1295 2471 52 4 specifically within the rural category four 17 4 and three 13 investigations were based in agricultural environments primarily focusing on fresh produce and livestock production respectively studies conducted in mixed i e peri urban settings accounted for 4 23 17 4 of reviewed investigations identified studies based on urban settings were less common 3 23 13 the intersection between geographical study location income category and local setting is presented in fig 3 all investigations conducted in upper middle economies originated from sub saharan africa primarily due to the high aggregation of studies conducted in south africa n 5 fig 2 most investigations conducted in high income countries were based in rural environments 10 12 83 3 fig 3 3 2 study design climate and seasonality the dataset largely comprised investigations focusing on groundwater vtec prevalence 21 23 91 3 in contrast to those prompted by outbreaks of infection 2 23 8 7 table 1 the two infection related investigations derived from outbreaks associated with i consumption of bagged spinach in the usa and canada jay et al 2007 and ii drinking water in a school camp in south korea park et al 2018 studies more frequently originated from high latitudes fig 2 resulting in the predominance of temperate 10 23 43 5 and cold 4 23 17 4 climatic classifications table 1 single or one off sampling regimes accounted for 15 23 65 2 of studies and 1638 2471 66 3 of analysed samples respectively more than half of identified investigations 13 23 56 5 comprised sample collection during sampling months characterized by high local precipitation the latter is sub divided into investigations fully conducted within periods of inferred high precipitation 7 23 30 4 and those incorporating both high and low precipitation sampling periods 6 23 26 1 however a substantial number of investigations provided insufficient information relating to employed sampling regime thus precluding integration of sampling months and averaged monthly precipitation 9 23 39 1 temporally 2 23 8 7 sampling campaigns were restricted to a short one month period with longer sampling campaigns lasting 2 months 15 23 65 2 more frequently employed table 1 additionally most studies adopted sampling designs incorporating analysis of 11 groundwater sources 17 23 73 9 table 1 similarly investigations focusing on 51 groundwater samples were prevalent 14 23 60 8 fig 4 summarizes the scale of sampling design employed among investigations excluding those failing to report sampling campaign duration n 6 3 3 groundwater supply characteristics and detection methods approximately half of the identified studies focused on groundwater supplies classified as serving an individual household i e privately owned 11 23 47 8 table 1 most studies 18 23 78 3 analysed groundwater supplies classified as boreholes i e protected accounting for a total of 1518 2471 61 4 samples analysed groundwater supplies categorized as hand dug wells only featured in two investigations few investigations reported vtec analysis on groundwater samples which were subject to treatment e g chemical physical n 3 however several studies failed to describe if a treatment system was employed n 10 as shown table 1 there was a tendency for investigations to adhere to source sample collection points with supplies directly sampled in 11 23 47 8 investigations conversely collection of samples from a domestic tap i e following distribution was reported in 4 23 17 4 studies approximately half of reviewed studies based vtec analysis on sample volumes of 100 250 ml 11 23 47 8 with the preferred method employed for sample concentration being membrane filtration 16 23 69 6 molecular identification comprising pcr was the favoured detection method 19 23 82 6 application of quantitative pcr was limited to 3 19 15 9 investigations in total 14 19 73 4 investigations employed pcr on e coli previously isolated through culture enrichment a subset of pcr based studies incorporated pcr analysis of all groundwater samples collected 5 19 26 3 overall application of vtec serotype typing tools to identify potential environmental sources was infrequently employed 3 23 13 table 1 3 4 generic e coli and vtec detection rates vtec was cultured and or genetic markers stx1 stx2 identified in 9 23 39 1 studies with overall sample and source specific detection rates of 0 6 16 2471 and 1 3 25 1998 respectively the unexpected higher number of positive supply sources in contrast to groundwater samples stems from the prevalence of inconsistent reporting in the review dataset with several investigations failing to specify source sample vtec detection rates table s3 based on positive pcr detection in 8 19 42 1 reviewed studies gene detection was reported in 0 8 4 477 of groundwater samples and 6 9 34 493 supplies analysed table 1 a single study employing culture based methods reported positive identification of presumed e coli o157 in an unspecified number of groundwater sources samples based on pooled i e category specific values deriving from the review dataset parallels between groundwater sample detection rates of generic e coli and vtec according to study sampling strategy one off and repeat are presented in fig 5 pooled study data indicates a generic e coli groundwater sample detection rate of 315 1926 16 4 fig 5a notwithstanding a total of 7 23 30 4 investigations did not explicitly report the study specific generic e coli detection rate again this lack of reporting was associated with ambiguous incomplete data collation and or presentation 4 23 17 or was related to investigations not employing e coli as a groundwater fecal indicator organism fio i e direct vtec detection 3 23 13 overall a vtec to generic e coli sample detection ratio of 15 152 9 9 was estimated fig 5a additionally vtec generic e coli specific to repeat and one off investigations of 16 7 and 7 5 were estimated fig 5 in terms of geographic vtec generic e coli detection ratios europe 19 2 and north america 17 5 exhibited the highest values table 3 pooled vtec detection rates for groundwater samples and groundwater supply sources of 0 7 16 2230 and 1 3 25 1949 were calculated respectively similar to generic e coli incidence several investigations failed to report sufficient data to calculate vtec detection rates specifically 5 9 55 6 vtec positive studies failed to specify the number of contaminated groundwater samples fig 5a likewise 3 9 33 3 investigations did not report the number of sampled groundwater supplies 3 5 potential drivers of vtec in groundwater geographically highest vtec groundwater detection rates were reported in sub saharan africa 10 152 6 6 table 2 this feature is clearly reflected in country specific data fig 2 with south africa reporting the highest vtec supply detection rates 8 5 a local study abia et al 2017 reported the highest vtec dataset prevalence with respect to groundwater supplies 9 18 50 in turn won et al 2013 reported the highest sample detection rate 7 180 3 9 among dairy farm environments in ohio usa high groundwater supply detection rates in sub saharan africa influence the high values observed in upper middle income categories 10 130 7 7 table 2 fig 3 extracted data also indicate urban and peri urban environments had higher supply vtec contamination rates at 5 4 and 4 9 respectively conversely rural settings had lower pooled vtec supply sample detection rates of 0 7 and 0 9 respectively climate trends indicate environments classified as temperate 14 554 2 5 and cold 8 392 2 accounted for a majority of contaminated supply sources estimates likely constrained by the high latitude focus of studies comprising the dataset table 1 conversely no vtec were reported in the single data reporting investigation based in arid environments within the context of supply regulation management public supplies n 2 exhibited no contamination in contrast to those under private or alternate i e mixed administration table 2 overall private i e unregulated groundwater samples 15 800 1 9 and supplies 15 631 2 4 were characterised by the highest vtec detection rates moreover while the number of investigations explicitly focusing on hand dug supplies was low n 2 higher supply detection rates were calculated 9 40 22 5 in comparison to supply sources classified as protected 11 1137 1 assessing the potential nexus between seasonality and sampling design investigations focusing sampling efforts during periods of normally high precipitation reported higher detection rates for both groundwater samples 15 683 2 2 and supplies 15 649 2 3 relative to low precipitation periods where there was no reported detection across samples or sources table 2 the two investigations based on temporally limited sampling campaigns 1 month reported the highest sample supply vtec prevalence 6 and 7 8 respectively similarly vtec source detection rates were higher 10 in studies characterized by a more limited scope in terms of the number of sampled groundwater supplies n 10 pooled data indicate comparable groundwater source detection rates among investigations focusing on 10 20 3 1 and 51 150 3 7 groundwater samples investigations incorporating repeated sampling regimes reported higher vtec supply detection rates 13 324 4 than one off investigations 12 1420 0 8 table 2 similarly as shown in fig 5 higher sample detection rates for generic e coli were reported in repeated 151 711 21 2 compared with one off 176 1440 12 2 investigations an overall adjusted vtec generic e coli detection ratio of 5 30 16 7 was calculated to account for the potential effects of repeat sampling on groundwater sample detection overall identification and attribution of contamination mechanisms pathways and sources were often absent and or subject to very ambiguous reporting only 3 9 33 3 investigations reporting positive vtec detection described potential ingress mechanism s table 4 specifically groundwater recharge and direct surface ingress were the primary ingress mechanisms suggested with each featuring in two investigations albeit largely based on tentative attribution table 4 reported presumptive contamination sources were evenly distributed among animal and human categories 5 6 83 3 with cattle the only specific source potentially linked to vtec groundwater supply contamination 3 5 60 table 4 in turn human contamination sources were often vaguely associated with domestic waste effluents with pit latrines explicitly linked with vtec supply ingress in 2 5 40 investigations contamination source attribution was primarily based on source proximity adjacency a total of 2 3 investigations employing environmental vtec strain typing reported the presence of vtec through comparison of pfge patterns obtained from human stool samples and drinking water isolates park et al 2018 identified groundwater as the most likely source of a multiple diarrhoeagenic e coli outbreak vtec epec similarly schets et al 2005 compared e coli o157 pfge patterns from groundwater isolates with collated records from different potential regional sources identifying cattle as the likely contamination source beyond select investigations focusing on specific agricultural settings n 7 most investigations had a broad i e landscape wide approach towards vtec detection without any reported explicit contamination sources table 1 2 a total of 5 8 62 5 pcr based investigations with positive vtec detection specified the serogroups identified with only o157 n 4 and o103 n 1 reported table 4 4 discussion 4 1 generic e coli and vtec detection ratios to the authors knowledge the current study represents the first attempt to globally quantify vtec incidence in groundwater supplies as such one of the key deliverables emanating from this investigation are estimated generic e coli vtec detection ratios fig 5 with potential bespoke applications in groundwater management the presented figures may be applicable for development of increasingly accurate qmra specifically focusing on domestic groundwater supplies haas et al 1999 primarily as a pathogen contribution or loading metric i e model input specific to groundwater borne vtec to date development of qmra for estimating the burden of groundwater borne vtec has largely relied on e coli e coli o157 ratios estimated from a range of environmental waters e g haas et al 1999 soller et al 2010 hence it may be contended that the presented ratios provide a more specific representation of vtec incidence in groundwater environments notwithstanding it is critical to highlight the potential influence of selective sampling on estimated values fig 5 key data trends e g sampling period number of supplies analysed suggest that studies with more inclusive i e random rather than targeted sampling designs frequently convey lower levels of vtec detection table 2 and as such the likelihood of bias introduced by targeting susceptible supplies i e proof of concept is emphasized and potentially compounded by publication bias i e failure to publish negative results identified as a key feature in a range of recent literature compilations with similar scope hynds et al 2014a andrade et al 2018 l 2020 chique et al 2020 there is sufficient evidence to suggest that sampling bias is somewhat ubiquitous within the microbial groundwater contamination literature a factor which may compromise the integrity of estimates presented herein arguably the ratio estimated from studies adopting repeat sampling 16 7 may provide a more realistic estimate of generic e coli presence and concurrent vtec incidence in groundwater as such the calculated repeat value likely represents a more robust metric which can be applied to accurately discern human vtec exposure over time evidently the latter is expected to exhibit natural temporal variation with the repeat ratio presented perhaps best representative of an annual mean based on the reported distribution of sampling periods table 2 generic e coli vtec ratios deriving from repeat investigations are also less compromised by incomplete reporting which potentially reinforces the cogency of estimated values fig 5 previous qmras focusing on domestic water distribution systems e g howard et al 2006 katukiza et al 2013 machdar et al 2013 abia et al 2016 have employed an e coli vtec detection rate of 8 viz haas et al 1999 also employed for e coli epec shresta et al s 2017 and comparable with the low range presented in this investigation 7 5 9 9 fig 5 in turn hynds et al 2014b use the lower bound probabilistic range of 1 16 as reported by soller et al 2010 from untreated drinking water the latter exhibits some agreement with the estimated 16 7 ratio based on repeat sampling fig 5b while available figures are comparable the likelihood of estimated e coli and vtec values being inflated as a result of selective sampling needs to be highlighted clearly the lack of clear and homogeneous reporting relating to both e coli and vtec groundwater sample detection fig 5 table 2 represents a critical limitation among identified studies 4 2 vtec groundwater incidence and geographical data trends pooled review data were used to establish vtec groundwater sample supply detection rates of 0 7 and 1 3 respectively the unexpected lower detection rates estimated for groundwater samples in contrast to supplies are an artefact of inconsistent reporting of vtec detection among investigations table s3 in light of the potential effects of selective sampling and likelihood of figure inflation it is argued that values deriving from investigations employing repeat sampling designs 1 4 table 2 provide more robust vtec prevalence estimates which are potentially representative of global contamination baselines notably a recent investigation stokdyk et al 2020 not included in the review dataset published outside review period reporting on a comprehensive number of groundwater samples n 834 and supplies n 145 identified comparable vtec sample detection rates 0 4 to those presented here analogous values may serve to support presented vtec detection rates however this study was both geographically restricted and exclusively focused on public supplies with any comparisons thus requiring careful interpretation overall the low number of investigations identified n 23 and relatively limited number of groundwater samples supplies comprising the review dataset table 1 represent both a key finding and research gap considering i the importance of vtec as a globally significant waterborne pathogen and concomitant clinical burden and ii reported links between groundwater resources and risk of human infection muniesa et al 2006 majowicz et al 2014 guzman herrador et al 2015 moreira and bondelind 2017 similarly the lack of robust data on vtec serotype prevalence in groundwater wells table 4 constitutes another important finding particularly considering the increasingly reported global incidence and clinical burden of non o157 serotypes and potential for regional serotype variability gould et al 2013 luna gierke et al 2014 baranzoni et al 2016 geographically the review dataset was characterized by key regional data knowledge gaps fig 2 the lack of regional data represents a crucial limitation accounting for both reported geographical variations in notified vtec infections and potential influence of local regional risk factors croxen et al 2013 newell and la ragione 2018 regional e coli and vtec incidence data are essential for deriving geographically specific information and distributions for example murphy et al 2016 pooled available data from two north american studies to produce custom qmra health risk assessments for canadian groundwater supplies despite the poor geographical distribution encountered and prospective bias in source selection some of the collated regional figures and generic e coli vtec ratios may find useful application in future investigations table 2 3 fig 2 4 3 local environments settlement patterns and land use emphasizing the importance of local risk factors is key considering higher vtec groundwater supply detection rates in urban 5 4 and mixed 4 9 settings table 2 to an extent findings exhibit a disparity with available geostatistical evidence linking vtec prevalence with rural environments in high income regions schets et al 2005 denno et al 2009 óhaiseadha et al 2017 brehony et al 2018 notably the majority of reviewed investigations based in urban and mixed settings were concentrated in lower income regions in asia and sub saharan africa fig 3 available evidence from sub saharan africa highlights the intensity of peri urban animal rearing the prevalence of domestic wastewater sources incidence of zoonotic vtec strains and high contamination burden on groundwater resources kulabako et al 2007 adelana et al 2008 braune and xu 2010 lupindu et al 2014 lapworth et al 2017 notably in terms of cattle management practices barn feedlot confinement as opposed to traditional pastoral i e free roaming rearing has been associated with lower vtec environmental prevalence in developing countries callaway et al 2009 smith et al 2011 however considering spatial contiguity presented results suggest that a diffuse livestock source distribution and the associated potential for close interaction with groundwater supplies receptor increase the likelihood of supply pathogenic contamination and human vtec exposure highlighted geographical and land use trends may also reflect the regional importance of manure application land spreading in agriculture a potentially key conduit for environmental vtec dissemination fremaux et al 2008 ferens and hovde 2011 van elsas et al 2011 however detailed data on manure soil application rates at a global scale are not available with any conjectures made on the geographical influence of soil manure on estimated vtec prevalence subject to speculation investigations based in agricultural environments focusing on fresh produce n 4 reported no positive vtec detections table 2 with a calculated fio e coli sample detection rate of 11 7 18 154 results are relevant in light of global evidence for microbial contamination in produce growing regions and the potential for pathogen propagation via fresh produce e g german sprout outbreak ca 2011 buchholz et al 2011 pachepsky et al 2011 nguyen the et al 2016 in particular due to its zoonotic origin enhanced survival capacity in soil water and high prevalence in farming environments vtec is a leading etiological agent of outbreaks linked to the consumption of fresh produce olaimat and holley 2012 lal et al 2012 jung et al 2014 conversely studies based in rural environments with an explicit focus on cattle rearing exhibited higher vtec detection rates in comparison to other rural sub categories table 2 however two investigations of supplies located adjacent to concentrated animal feeding operations cafos economides et al 2012 li et al 2015 reported positive fio e coli groundwater sample detection 8 6 but no vtec contamination similarly joung et al 2013 analysed groundwater wells in relation to confined livestock carcass burial sites all samples analysed n 627 were negative for vtec with rates of generic e coli contamination calculated at 7 3 the results presented seem to support the aforementioned inferences relating to the spatial distribution i e confinement of potential vtec sources and decreased likelihood of groundwater supply contamination 4 4 potential influence of climate and seasonality although based on limited data both in frequency and scope summary statistics highlight the potential influence of temperate and cold climatic settings on higher rates of vtec supply incidence 2 2 5 table 2 pooled data may at times discreetly reflect the cumulative effects of lower temperatures reduced ultraviolet uv solar radiation and higher precipitation on vtec survival transport and thus environmental prevalence there is substantial evidence within the literature supporting enhanced extra host e coli and vtec survival at lower temperatures 10 c in both environmental and potable water soils plant material cattle feces and derived effluents e g manure slurry john and rose 2005 fremaux et al 2008 ma et al 2011 van elsas et al 2011 generally increased stress and energy expenditure associated with higher temperatures limits e coli persistence in the environment with large amplitude oscillations 7 c particularly impacting e coli survival semenov et al 2007 previous experiments conducted on natural well water indicate increased vtec survival at 5 10 c rice et al 1992 watterworth et al 2006 collated data trends may also be partially due to reduced levels of solar uv radiation in temperate and cold settings increasing vtec prevalence in soils surface water and manures prior to mobilization to subsoils and groundwater lejeune et al 2001 yaun et al 2003 2004 fremaux et al 2008 additionally the effects of high rainfall on the release and propagation of fecal material and bacteria through enhanced landscape hydrological connectivity e g overland flow have been well substantiated fremaux et al 2008 hofstra 2011 mccarthy et al 2012 blaustein et al 2016 unsurprisingly vtec outbreaks have been frequently linked with periods of heavy antecedent rainfall muniesa et al 2006 o dwyer et al 2016 these effects are suggested via higher vtec sample supply detection rates calculated from investigations focusing on periods of high precipitation 2 table 2 e coli have also been shown to benefit from anaerobic and microaerobic conditions provided by moist or waterlogged environments often found in wet temperate settings fremaux et al 2008 brennan et al 2010 van elsas et al 2011 4 5 contamination sources pathways and hydrogeology reviewed investigations also alluded to the potential relevance of human contamination sources and specifically latrines with the exception of one study won et al 2013 all investigations align contamination sources with human origin derived from lower income settings n 4 thus reinforcing the potential underlying role of socioeconomic drivers graham and polizzotto 2013 just three investigations reported potential ingress mechanisms table 4 all of which were largely grounded on inconclusive evidence representing a critical knowledge gap a major methodological limitation precluding accurate identification of vtec contamination sources was the lack of molecular vtec strain typing employed in reviewed studies e g pfge mlva table 1 a significant majority of studies tentatively identified vtec sources based on proximity rather than employing dna typing to effectively link source s and receptor s thus representing a key implication for the applicability of reported data as such while cattle are generally reported as a major source of environmental vtec their importance as a reservoir in developing regions in the absence of data is more uncertain mainga et al 2018 accordingly other key animal or human vtec reservoirs may remain unaccounted for ferens and hovde 2011 ahmed et al 2015 in general an integrative research approach aimed at identifying vtec contamination sources pathways and potential risk factors is often superseded by a focus on quantifying vtec environmental prevalence this feature is also reflected in the recurrent omission of local hydro geological characteristics table 1 accounting for the influence of parent materials on key sub soil characteristics e g porosity permeability and in turn e coli survival and transport i e retention filtration study area hydrogeological setting represents a pivotal driver fremaux et al 2008 bolster et al 2009 van elsas et al 2011 however a limited number of investigations provided relevant hydrogeological descriptions 5 23 21 7 ferguson et al 2012 associated local geology with vtec groundwater contamination through provision of evidence based links between shallow unconfined sandy aquifers rainfall intensity and efficient groundwater recharge similarly li et al 2015 attributed unsaturated alluvial sediment soil layers 3 30 m with a high pollutant attenuation capacity and mitigation of vtec transport to groundwater additional investigations reporting hydrogeological data did not directly address the potential relevance in terms of vtec incidence incorporation of hydrogeological parameters as potential risk factors in future investigations is thus strongly advised 4 6 groundwater supply type infrastructure and administration with noted exceptions e g ferguson et al 2012 a significant majority of reviewed investigations failed to describe sample collection protocols and wellhead characteristics e g tap pump allowing for discrimination of the effects if any of supply design construction on vtec incidence moreover descriptions of source structural components e g well casing seal and other key features e g depth age were also largely absent from reviewed investigations table s3 this represents an impediment to identifying risk factors pertaining to vtec supply ingress and inappropriate faulty structural components ferguson et al 2012 have identified increased supply depth as a determining factor limiting vtec contamination attributed to effective pathogen attenuation with increasing soil depth despite its potential importance only 3 23 13 studies explicitly reported groundwater supply depth li et al 2015 failed to detect vtec irrespective of groundwater well depth while won et al 2013 found no association between well depth and vtec contamination citing inadequate private supply maintenance as a possible mechanism for vtec ingress the influence of varying levels of supply maintenance regulation and surveillance are potentially reflected in the higher vtec detection values estimated for private supplies table 2 in contrast to public municipal supplies which are generally managed by local regional regulatory authorities and often comprise water treatment systems private supplies are largely unregulated and untreated and as such more likely subject to inadequate maintenance and microbiological contamination hexemer et al 2008 kreutswiser et al r 2011 daniels et al 2016 fox et al 2016 review findings thus contribute to a growing body of evidence emphasizing the potential transmission of enteric pathogens and human exposure through private groundwater supplies hynds et al 2014a wallender et al 2014 murphy et al 2017 additionally higher vtec detection rates among private supplies may also point to the prevalence of direct source contamination rather than widespread or aquifer wide groundwater pollution pooled data based on inferred levels of supply construction and integrity indicate hand dug supplies had elevated vtec detection rates 22 5 table 2 however findings require careful interpretation as they largely reflect detection levels reported in a single study abia et al 2017 only two investigations explicitly analysed hand dug groundwater supplies both deriving from sub saharan africa accordingly any assessment of risk factors associated with supplies and levels of protection are precluded by i vague descriptions of groundwater supplies ii tentative nature of supply classifications employed and iii low number of identified investigations explicitly analysing unimproved supplies n 2 5 conclusion and recommendations presented herein is the first global scoping review of the presence of verotoxigenic e coli vtec in groundwater sources intended for human consumption overall a vtec to generic e coli sample detection ratio of 15 152 9 9 was derived from reviewed investigations providing a baseline for vtec in e coli contaminated groundwater sources based on the relatively low number of identified investigations prevalence of inconsistent reporting and limited amount of data comprising the review dataset a major recommendation deriving from this investigation is the pressing need for additional field based studies data on vtec prevalence in groundwater systems additional data is essential to improve established vtec groundwater contamination baselines and accurately identify extra local contamination risk factors which are in turn necessary to inform relevant multi disciplinary stakeholders including groundwater consumers public health authorities and regulatory bodies environmental managers and hydrogeologists similarly investigations deriving from geographically diverse settings are required to obtain insights data applicable within different hydro geological climatic and local settlement urban rural contexts the following bespoke guidelines recommendations are proposed to improve the scope integrity and insights obtained from future vtec groundwater investigations explicit study reporting of basic summary statistics and methodology

approaches and systematic design of sampling programmes is not only warranted but necessary regardless findings of this study offer valuable insights into the extent and significance of groundwater as

17392,peracetic acid paa has attracted growing attention as an alternative oxidant and disinfectant in wastewater treatment due to the increased demand to reduce chlorine usage and control disinfection byproducts dbps these applications have stimulated new investigations on paa based advanced oxidation processes aops which can enhance water disinfection and remove micropollutants the purpose of this review is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of scientific information and experimental data reported in recent years on the applications of paa based aops for the removal of chemical and microbiological micropollutants from water and wastewater various methods of paa activation including the supply of external energy and metal metal free catalysts as well as their activation mechanisms are discussed then a review on the usage of paa based aops for contaminant degradation is given the degradation mechanisms of organic compounds and the influence of the controlling parameters of paa based treatment systems are summarized and discussed concurrently the application of paa based aops for water disinfection and the related mechanisms of microorganism inactivation are also reviewed since combining uv light with paa is the most commonly investigated paa based aop for simultaneous pathogen inactivation and micropollutant oxidation we have also focused on paa microbial inactivation kinetics together with the effects of key experimental parameters on the process moreover we have discussed the advantages and disadvantages of uv paa as an aop against the well known and established uv h2o2 finally the knowledge gaps challenges and new opportunities for research in this field are discussed this critical review will facilitate an in depth understanding of the paa based aops for water and wastewater treatment and provide useful perspectives for future research and development for paa based technologies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid advanced oxidation processes activation degradation disinfection 1 introduction increased industrialization and urbanization have reduced the availability of clean water due to associated environmental stressors such as land desertification fresh water crisis the greenhouse effect air pollution and so on moreover a growing number of emerging contaminants e g pharmaceuticals personal care products endocrine disruptors artificial sweeteners disinfection by products and pesticides are continuously introduced into the aquatic environment gogoi et al 2018 tran et al 2018 wilkinson et al 2017 which can have adverse ecotoxicological impacts as a result water pollution is becoming an increasingly complex and challenging problem increasingly public health and environmental concerns drive efforts to develop more efficient low cost and green treatment methods for water disinfection and decontamination from source to point of use in recent years many technological approaches for water and wastewater treatment have been proposed and among these technologies advanced oxidation processes aops have gained growing acceptance for water disinfection and decontamination conventional aops have shown good efficiency for eliminating chemical and microbial contaminants in water guerra rodríguez et al 2018 ibhadon and fitzpatrick 2013 xiao et al 2018 you et al 2019 moreover aops provide a strategy for combining two individual processes into one treatment step water disinfection and decontamination which further improves the cost effectiveness of the treatment tsydenova et al 2015 the main process in most aops is the in situ generation of highly reactive species such as the hydroxyl radical oh the superoxide radical o2 and the sulfate radical so4 that can destroy organic pollutants and pathogens krýsa et al 2018 currently hydroxyl radical based processes are the most studied treatments among various aops the hydroxyl radical has higher oxidation potential approx 2 72 v shah et al 2013 than other common disinfectants oxidants such as ozone chlorine and chlorine dioxide wang and wang 2018 and it is non selective in attacking target molecules which make it suitable for treating polluted water wang and xu 2012 hydroxyl radical based aops can be classified into fenton or fenton like processes brillas 2020 pereira et al 2012 ozonation zhang et al 2019 photolytic like processes wols and hofman caris 2012 and photocatalytic like processes khaki et al 2017 according to the method used for producing the radical species however the efficiency of hydroxyl radical based aops can be limited in complex water matrices containing hydroxyl radical scavengers such as the carbonate bicarbonate anion and natural organic matter nom matta et al 2011 therefore in recent years employing reactive species with higher selectivity such as the sulfate radical has gained increasing attention oh et al 2016 peracetic acid paa is an organic peroxyacid that has been widely used in various applications as a disinfectant sanitizer bleach sterilizing agent oxidizer and polymerization catalyst luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 a steadily growing number of scientific publications in recent years involving paa demonstrates the importance of these applications fig 1 according to grand view research 2016 the application of paa in water treatment processes was projected to grow at the highest compound annual growth rate cagr due to the increased sanitation awareness simplicity of application and the higher regulatory standards for water treatment compared with some of the conventional disinfectants the advantages of paa for water disinfection and microbial inactivation include a high sterilization ability a lower dependence on ph an easy technical implementation and reduced formation of toxic byproducts in the treated effluent as such paa has become a promising substitute for chlorinated disinfectants for water treatment domínguez henao turolla and antonelli 2018 in addition to its use as a disinfectant paa has the potential for degrading aqueous organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals due to its high oxidation potential du et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 more recently studies have focused on employing paa in aop by activating it using external energy or catalysts to produce the reactive species kim et al 2019 rizzo et al 2018 wang et al 2020b zhou et al 2015 furthermore synergistic effects for degrading organic contaminants and inactivating pathogens in water have been demonstrated for paa based aops hollman et al 2020 although a growing number of studies have focused on paa based aops over the past decade several open problems still exist the exact mechanisms of paa activation identification of the dominant radical species and the efficiency of paa based aops for eliminating various chemical and microbiological contaminants to the best of our knowledge there is no comprehensive review on the application of paa based aops in water treatment this paper presents a review on recent advances in paa based aops with emphasis on the elimination of chemical and microbiological pollutions from water finally new important areas for further research and development in paa based water disinfection and decontamination technologies are outlined 2 history of paa based water treatment paa was first synthetized and studied systematically in 1902 freer and novy 1902 however it was not considered as a bactericidal agent until 1955 fraise et al 2013 soon after paa gained wide acceptance as a disinfectant or oxidant in various industries such as food industry healthcare fine chemicals pulp paper and water treatment with the discovery of chloroform which is a chlorination by product in drinking water in the early 1970s bellar et al 1974 the presence of such toxic disinfection by products dbps have become a growing public health concern this observation has prompted the search for alternative cost effective and environmentally friendly disinfectants to replace conventional chlorination in order to minimize the formation of dbps in this context the interest of employing paa disinfection in water treatment emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s baldry 1983 meyer 1976 the main motivations of employing paa as an alternative to chlorine include 1 very limited or no formation of toxic dbps hassaballah et al 2020 xue et al 2017 2 a wide spectrum of microbial activity similar to chlorine garg et al 2016 and 3 economic feasibility mcfadden et al 2017 paa disinfection was first introduced to treat wastewater effluents in europe and later it gradually became adopted in north america in 1985 the united states environmental protection agency usepa first registered paa as an antimicrobial agent for indoor use on hard surfaces in hospitals later usepa approved the application of paa for combined sewer overflow disinfection in 1999 and for wastewater disinfection in 2012 since then paa disinfection in water treatment has been studied extensively e g the treatment of municipal wastewater manoli et al 2019 industrial effluents kitis 2004 sludge fraser et al 1985 potable water xue et al 2017 and ballast water shah et al 2015 caretti and lubello 2003 conducted a five month long pilot plant study using 1 paa alone 2 uv light irradiation alone 3 addition of paa upstream of the uv device paa uv and 4 addition of paa downstream of the uv device uv paa they found that paa uv process denoted as uv paa process showed the highest efficiency due to the formation of free radicals furthermore the uv paa treatment may considerably reduce the disinfectant dosage contact time and operational cost beber de souza et al 2015 lubello et al 2002 therefore in the last decade the possible use of uv paa for water disinfection has received renewed attention the formation of reactive radical species during uv paa suggests that it may potentially be a new water decontamination technology for removing aqueous organic pollutants 3 chemical and physical properties of paa paa ch3c o ooh belongs to the class of organic peroxides and its molecular structure is shown in fig 2 the properties of paa are listed in table 1 paa is strong oxidizing agent with a high standard reduction potential e 0 1 96 v which is close to h2o2 and higher than chlorine or chlorine dioxide table 2 paa is a man made chemical which is synthesized by reacting acetic acid with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in the presence of a catalyst such as sulfuric acid fiege et al 2012 zhao et al 2007 1 c h 3 c o oh h 2 o 2 h 2 s o 4 c h 3 c o ooh h 2 o the concentration of paa in commercial equilibrium solutions is typically 5 15 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 paa solutions exceeding 15 begin to exhibit some degree of explosiveness instability and reactivity kitis 2004 a stabilizer or a sequestering compound such as alkali metal polyphosphates dipicolinic acid or quinoline derivatives is often used in the production of commercial paa solutions fraise et al 2013 the equilibrium state of paa is a mixture containing paa acetic acid h2o2 and water the molar ratio of paa to h2o2 in commercial paa formulations available in the market is typically 0 1 3 0 zhang and huang 2020a note that the h2o2 present in equilibrium paa is also a disinfectant although h2o2 can also contribute to the inactivation capability of the mixture and the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh flores et al 2015 paa is a stronger disinfectant for a wide spectrum of micro organisms while h2o2 requires much larger dosages to reach the same level of inactivation flores et al 2014 wagner et al 2002 paa is clear colorless liquid with a strong pungent acrid odor and no foaming capability kitis 2004 it is weaker acid than the parent acetic acid and has a pka value of 8 2 zhao et al 2007 2 c h 3 c o ooh h 2 o c h 3 c o o o h 3 o at ambient pressure a 12 paa has the freezing point typically in the range of 40 3 to 42 0 c kitis 2004 it is important to note that paa is highly corrosive as an organic peroxide paa is thermodynamically unstable and can decompose or explode when heated or under impact wang et al 2015 the thermal stability is mainly determined by the dissociation energy of the peroxide o o bond paa has a weaker peroxide bond 159 kj mol than h2o2 213 kj mol bianchini et al 2002 natural decomposition of paa solution may occur at room temperature and produces acetic acid and oxygen eq 3 thermal decomposition of paa is a first order reaction which accelerates with increasing temperature for example the decomposition rate constants of paa in a commercial solution containing 5 paa and 20 h2o2 are 1 71 10 3 h 1 at 25 c and 9 64 10 3 h 1 at 45 c kunigk et al 2001 the recommended storage temperature for paa solutions is below 30 c to avoid decomposition wang et al 2015 the stability of paa solution also depends on the ph and the addition of bases would lead to decomposition with loss of active oxygen fiege et al 2012 in the ph range between 5 5 and 8 2 paa decomposes spontaneously but hydrolysis appears to be negligible eq 3 whereas above ph 8 2 paa undergoes both spontaneous decomposition and hydrolysis producing acetic acid and h2o2 eq 4 chen and pavlostathis 2019 3 2 c h 3 c o ooh 2 c h 3 c o oh o 2 4 c h 3 c o ooh h 2 o o h c h 3 c o oh h 2 o 2 the spontaneous decomposition is the fastest near ph 8 2 yuan et al 1997a and the rate of hydrolysis increases along with increasing ph yuan et al 1997b it has been reported that the decomposition rate constants of paa were between 2 08 10 3 and 9 44 10 3 h 1 at ph 3 11 between 2 61 10 3 and 16 69 10 3 h 1 at ph 5 0 and between 7 50 10 3 and 47 63 10 3 h 1 at ph 7 0 kunigk et al 2014 4 paa activation methods in paa based aops the formation of reactive radical species is an important step for water and wastewater disinfection and oxidation of aqueous micropollutants the radical generation can be activated by a variety of methods such as uv solar light irradiation ultrasound exposure or catalysis metal ions activated carbon 4 1 activation by radiation the additional energy provided by uv solar irradiation ultrasound or even gamma radiation can activate the peroxide in aops among these energy sources uv light is the most commonly used activation method 4 1 1 uv light irradiation in recent years uv has attracted wide interest for microbial disinfection and degradation of organic pollutants by direct or indirect photolysis it has been reported that the efficiency of uv light irradiation can be improved by adding oxidants or photosensitizing compounds into the system buthiyappan et al 2015 the most commonly applied uv light wavelength for paa activation is 254 nm which is readily available from low pressure mercury lamps the general appearance of aqueous paa uv absorption spectrum is similar to h2o2 but with a slightly lower overall absorbance cai et al 2017 keller et al 2008 cai et al 2017 determined the quantum yield of paa by introducing an excess amount of tba to inhibit the reaction between paa and oh the obtained quantum yields at 254 nm were 1 20 and 2 09 mol einstein 1 for the neutral paa and anionic paa forms respectively however the removal of paa by other reactive species e g ch3c o o was not accounted for in the study by cai et al 2017 besides after reacting with oh tba may yield the tba radical ch3 3co which can react with paa zhang and huang 2020b in order to obtain accurate quantum yield data zhang and huang 2020b used 2 4 hexadiene as the radical scavenger to inhibit reaction of paa with both oh and ch3c o o during the photolysis the quantum yield for the protonated paa in that study was found to be 0 88 0 04 mol einstein 1 a greater than unity quantum yield would indicate that secondary reactions of the hot fragments from the primary photolysis contribute to this process according to eq 5 irradiation of paa with uv light leads to homolytic o o bond cleavage yielding oh and acetyloxyl radicals ch3c o o this is the first and rate determining step for the formation of reactive radicals during uv paa process caretti and lubello 2003 lubello et al 2002 5 c h 3 c o ooh hv c h 3 c o o oh subsequently both oh and ch3c o o can further react with paa or acetic acid yielding secondary radicals the hydroxyl radical can attack paa via h abstraction resulting in the formation of acetylperoxyl radical ch3c o oo rokhina et al 2010 eq 6 furthermore ch3c o o can also abstract hydrogen atom from paa to form ch3c o oo and acetic acid eq 7 zhang and huang 2020b 6 c h 3 c o ooh oh c h 3 c o oo h 2 o 7 c h 3 c o ooh c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o oo c h 3 c o oh the primary acetyloxyl radical can undergo unimolecular decay which is commonly referred to as decarboxylation yielding co2 and ch3 eq 8 8 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o 2 the decarboxylation rate of ch3c o o was reported to be equal or less than 2 3 105 s 1 according to zhang and huang 2020b and a similar decarboxylation rate 1 0 106 s 1 was obtained by kamath et al 2018 the ch3 formed from ch3c o o decarboxylation can rapidly react with oxygen to generate a peroxyl radical ooch3 which can further undergo bimolecular decay zhang and huang 2020b 9 c h 3 o 2 ooc h 3 10 ooc h 3 ooc h 3 hcho c h 3 oh o 2 11 ooc h 3 ooc h 3 2 hcho h 2 o 2 12 ooc h 3 ooc h 3 2 oc h 3 o 2 furthermore due to the lack of α h ch3c o oo formed by h abstraction from paa eq 6 7 can undergo bimolecular decay to recycle ch3c o o 13 c h 3 c o oo c h 3 c o oo 2 c h 3 c o o o 2 ch3c o o formed is expected to undergo radical radical coupling according to chateauneuf et al 1988 14 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o o 2 the primary hydroxyl radical may also react with ch3c o o to produce paa therefore partially restarting the oxidation cycle rokhina et al 2010 however zhang and huang 2020b indicated that the reaction between ch3c o o and oh had an insignificant influence to the overall reaction scheme which is expected based on the low steady state concentrations of the two species the presence of h2o2 and acetic acid in equilibrium paa solution their uv photolysis and the new radicals formed increase the complexity of uv paa mechanism zhang and huang 2020b proposed a reaction scheme for uv paa in the presence of h2o2 and acetate ions fig 3 according to this scheme superoxide radical ho2 superoxide radical anion o2 and ooch2c o o have relatively high steady state concentrations during the process many recent scientific publications have focused on employing uv paa treatment for the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms and degradation of environmental pollutants note that uv light alone can directly degrade some organic contaminants which possess dissociative absorption bands in uv however in most cases it is difficult to achieve direct uv mineralization of organic pollutants or removal of uv resistant organisms such as adenoviruses sun et al 2018 on the other hand paa alone cannot effectively disinfect naturally occurring coliphages zanetti et al 2007 nor can it degrade recalcitrant pollutants due to lack of reactivity hey et al 2012 when paa treatment is combined with uv irradiation the contaminants and the pathogenic microorganisms can be destroyed by various mechanisms direct uv photolysis direct oxidation and the synergistic action of uv together with paa i e formation of reactive radical species buthiyappan et al 2015 several studies have demonstrated that uv paa can enhance the efficiency of disinfection and pollutant degradation by the synergistic effect indicating that uv paa is a promising technology for water treatment hassaballah et al 2020 hollman et al 2020 rizzo et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b zhang et al 2020a 4 1 2 solar light irradiation development of cost effective and environmentally friendly waste water treatment technologies is an on going topic of research recently a growing body of this work is focusing on employing renewable energy sources in aops compared with the traditional uv based aops significantly less data has been published on solar driven aops nevertheless some studies have explored the possibility of applying sunlight paa to remove chemical pollutants and pathogens from water similarly to uv irradiation of paa the formation of reactive radical species by sunlight paa also takes place through homolysis of the o o bond by uv photons rizzo et al 2018 employed sunlight paa to degrade chloramphenicol cap in water and compared the results with traditional uv paa the efficiency of the process was significantly reduced with both simulated and natural solar irradiation sources e g only 14 32 of cap was removed after 120 min by simulated solar paa hence the solar energy sources cannot produce high enough photon flux to generate sufficient concentration of reactive species from paa rizzo et al 2019 investigated the efficiency of sunlight paa process on treating contaminants of emerging concern in both groundwater gw and wastewater ww the results indicated that carbamazepine cbz was refractory to sunlight paa process whereas for sulfamethoxazole smx and diclofenac dcf sunlight paa enhanced the degradation efficiency compared to paa alone in gw matrix in general an aqueous matrix can greatly affect the efficiency of sunlight paa for example only 32 of dcf degradation was achieved with 2 mg l 1 of paa in ww compared to 99 observed in gw after 60 min of treatment in addition sunlight paa has also been applied for water disinfection both formisano et al 2016 and rizzo et al 2019 evaluated this approach for the inactivation of e coli and a good performance was observed for example 3 52 log reduction of e coli was achieved after 120 min of solar irradiation with a paa dose of 8 mg l 1 formisano et al 2016 4 1 3 other irradiation based methods the application of ultrasound us to activate paa has not been extensively studied so far although us technology has been commonly used to produce ros in hydroxyl radical based aops anandan et al 2020 panda et al 2020 xu et al 2020 rokhina et al 2013 applied us to enhance the degradation efficiency of phenol by mno2 paa process and found that us induced oxidation removed 70 of phenol within the first hour whereas only 40 was removed in the absence of us rokhina et al 2013 indicated that the us irradiation can generate a high concentration of active species to accelerate the oxidation process however further study on the activation mechanism of paa by ultrasound is still needed 4 2 metal catalysts metal catalysts have been widely used to activate oxidants to generate reactive radical species anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 several studies have investigated the feasibility of activating paa by transition metals mandelli et al 2007 wang et al 2020a wu et al 2020 generally metal catalysts can be classified as homogeneous catalysts dissolved transition metal ions or heterogeneous catalysts e g metal oxides the classic fenton process involves aqueous h2o2 fe2 system but a similar process has been observed for paa as well in such a scheme paa is activated by a transition metal catalyst such as fe co mn or cu the catalysts can decompose the o o bond and activate paa according to wang et al 2020a 15 m n c h 3 c o ooh m n 1 c h 3 c o o o h 16 m n 1 c h 3 c o ooh m n c h 3 c o oo h where m represents the metal catalyst 4 2 1 cobalt based catalysts previous studies have indicated that cobalt co shows better catalytic performance for paa activation than for example mn fe and cu zhang et al 1998a 1998b the decomposition of paa by co results in the production of ch3c o oo and ch3c o o as the primary reactive radical species note that this does not lead to the formation of oh which is an important difference in comparison to uv paa activation reactions given in eqs 17 and 18 show the production of the reactive radical species kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020b 17 c o 2 c h 3 c o ooh c o 3 c h 3 c o o o h 18 c o 3 c h 3 c o ooh c o 2 c h 3 c o oo h this shows that co2 and co3 are continuously recycled during the consumption of paa kim et al 2020 reported the rate constants for paa reacting with co2 and co3 over the initial ph 3 0 8 2 as follows 1 70 101 to 6 67 102 m 1 s 1 co2 and 3 91 10 to 4 57 102 m 1 s 1 co3 subsequently radical reactions shown in eqs 7 14 may generate secondary radicals such as ch3 ooch3 and ho2 wang et al 2020b proposed a reaction scheme involving the reactive species for co paa process targeting smx pollutant fig 4 recent research has focused on the efficiency of co paa process for the treatment of organic pollutants in water tian et al 2018 indicated that co ii paa system could effectively remove organic dyes showing better performance than the classic fenton process and yielding comparable efficiency to that of co ii peroxymonosulfate system in the study by wang et al 2020b the co paa process was used to degrade smx in water and it was observed that 89 4 of smx was removed after 15 min of treatment in addition wang et al 2020b also found that furosemide trichorophenol and naproxen nap all with relatively high initial concentrations 40 μm could be effectively removed by co paa kim et al 2020 evaluated the degradation of cbz smx nap and bisphenol a bpa by co paa and observed good degradation efficiencies over the initial ph range of 3 0 8 1 47 5 100 55 0 100 0 24 4 98 5 and 33 0 87 7 removal of bpa nap smx and cbz respectively cobalt oxides such as c o o co2o3 and co3o4 have also been considered as heterogeneous catalysts for activating various oxidants in order to degrade pollutants han et al 2012 hu and long 2016 among them co3o4 particles have shown good catalytic performance because of the presence of both co ii and co iii in the structure the paa activation mechanism by co3o4 has been put forward by reported similar results when they were applied wu et al 2020 in which the recycling of co2 and co3 was involved and ch3c o o and ch3c o oo were the primary reactive species formed 4 2 2 iron based catalysts iron based catalysts are extensively used in water treatment due to their low cost high efficiency and the environmental friendliness ferrous ion fe2 is the most used fe based catalyst and hence the ros formation mechanism has been widely investigated it is worth mentioning that oxo iron e g feivo2 complexes can form during a fenton process which is a weaker and more selective oxidant that has a longer lifetime he et al 2016 the proposed mechanism for paa decomposition by fe2 is shown below kim et al 2019 19 f e 2 c h 3 c o ooh f e 3 c h 3 c o o o h 20 f e 2 c h 3 c o ooh f e 3 c h 3 co o oh 21 f e 2 c h 3 c o ooh f e iv o 2 c h 3 c o oh note that fe2 can also react with h2o2 present in equilibrium paa solution but the associated reaction rate is much lower than with paa kim et al 2019 22 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 oh o h 23 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e iv o 2 h 2 o 24 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 ho 2 h the rate constant for the last reaction eq 24 is relatively small 0 001 0 01 m 1s 1 kim et al 2019 similarly the reaction rate of fe3 with paa was found to be much slower than fe2 kim et al 2019 moreover the primary reactive radicals and oxidants such as ch3c o o oh and feivo2 can in turn react with paa and h2o2 to form the secondary radicals such as ch3c o oo ch3co and ho2 cai et al 2017 kim et al 2019 rokhina et al 2013 wang et al 2020b kim et al 2019 have applied fe ii paa process to successfully degrade micropollutants such as methylene blue nap and bpa it was shown that this process can remove such pollutants with 48 to 98 efficiency in the ph range of 3 0 8 2 wang et al 2020a have developed a novel heterogeneous fe2 modified zeolite paa aop to degrade aqueous smx with the complete removal of smx achieved within 50 min at neutral ph virkutyte and varma 2014 studied eco friendly magnetic iron oxide pillared montmorillonite fe2o3 montmorillonite to activate paa for degrading dichlorophenol dcp and the results demonstrated that 70 of dcp could be removed after 3 5 h of treatment 4 2 3 mn based catalysts according to previous research the decomposition of paa by mn2 proceeds via non radical route via complicated redox reaction steps i e several mn oxidation states present popov et al 2005 studied the decomposition mechanism of paa by free mn2 ions and mn2 diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid complexes where the formation of radical intermediates was not observed the following non radical reaction scheme was proposed popov et al 2005 rothbart et al 2012

reaction mn2 is rapidly consumed and mn3 forms accordingly rothbart et al 2012 reported similar results when they applied mn2 paa process to degrade dye chemicals in water rokhina et al 2010 investigated degradation of phenol by paa in the presence of mno2 and suggested that homolysis of the peroxide bond in paa over mno2 can generate primary reactive species such as oh and ch3c o o later rokhina et al 2013 developed an ultrasound assisted mno2 paa process for the degradation of phenol and proposed that both radical and non radical schemes could be involved 4 2 4 other metal catalysts luna pabello et al 2009 evaluated the disinfection efficiency of ag paa and ag cu2 paa systems in raw wastewater samples their results showed that category a wastewater could be produced from raw wastewater by treating it with 1 2 12 0 90 mg l 1 of ag cu paa for 60 min similarly de velásquez yáñez noguez jiménez cisneros and luna pabello 2008 observed the enhancement of paa disinfection capability by augmenting the treatment with cu2 and ag ions when removing v cholerae salmonella sp shigella p aeruginosa helminth egg and fecal coliforms the increase in the disinfection efficiency may be due to 1 increased production of reactive radicals and or 2 oxidation of cu2 and ag to more toxic forms for microbiological organisms e g ag2o ag2o2 or cu2o luukkonen et al 2015 investigated the oxidation of bisphenol a bpa by paa in the presence of cu2 or fe2 catalysts it was demonstrated that bpa 60 mg l 1 could be completely removed after 10 min of treatment with 40 mg l 1 paa and 0 02 mg l 1 cu2 or fe2 at ph 3 5 4 3 carbon based catalysts nonmetallic carbonaceous catalysts are gaining growing attention in aop applications due to their relatively large specific surface area excellent chemical and thermal stability and the absence of secondary pollution no metal leaching problem hu et al 2019 pang et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 carbon based materials such as activated carbon ac graphene oxide go and carbon nanotubes cnts have been extensively studied for activating peroxides in water treatment processes up to date only one study has been published on using carbon catalyst to decompose paa zhou et al 2015 used activated carbon fibers acfs as the catalyst to activate paa for degrading dyes the acfs paa process could effectively remove reactive brilliant red x 3b dye over a wide ph range of 3 11 acfs can donate their non bonding electrons to paa which results in homolytic cleavage of the peroxide bond producing oh and ch3c o o 5 paa based aops for water decontamination various aquatic environments including surface water groundwater and wastewaters often contain refractory organic pollutants such as pesticides pharmaceuticals endocrine disruptors dyes and aromatic compounds gogoi et al 2018 tran et al 2018 wilkinson et al 2017 paa based aops may be considered as feasible treatments for waters contaminated with these hazardous and poorly biodegradable pollutants hence there is a growing number of new reports focusing on the application of paa based aops for decontaminating such waters 5 1 degradation of contaminants by direct paa oxidation previous research has indicated that paa alone fails to degrade many organic pollutants e g ibuprofen ibu nap dcf gemfibrozil and clofibric acid in wastewater at low dosages hey et al 2012 on the other hand this also means that paa appears to be more stable in the presence of nom than for example hydrogen peroxide it has also been reported that paa can react directly with some contaminants zhang et al 2017 peroxy organic acids including paa are relatively selective oxidizing agents that prefer attacking molecules containing electron rich moieties such as aromatic rings double and triple bonds levitt et al 2003 paa is likely to oxidize nucleophilic amino acids du et al 2018 as well as other nucleophiles such as β lactam antibiotics zhang et al 2017 in the latter case the reaction rate constant was observed to correlate with the global nucleophilicity of β lactams chipiso et al 2016 have studied the mechanism and kinetics of ethionamide eta oxidation by paa and found that the first step in the reaction is electrophilic attack by paa on the carbon sulfur double bond in eta adding an oxygen atom to the sulfur atom via epoxidation recently due to the growing application of paa in disinfection the oxidizing potential of paa towards various contaminants in water have been studied table 3 lists selected studies employing paa to directly oxidize pollutants in water for more details on the direct oxidation of compounds by paa kim and huang 2020 recently provided a review on the reactivity of paa with respect to various compounds including alkenes aldehydes simple aromatic compounds compounds containing sulfur or nitrogen moieties lignin and lignin model compounds and micropollutants and discussed related mechanisms the rate constants of paa oxidation of organic compounds vary widely by nearly 10 orders of magnitude from 3 2 10 6 to 1 0 105 m 1 s 1 demonstrating its selectivity 5 2 efficiency of water decontamination by paa based aops the removal of refractory organic contaminants from water and wastewater by using aops has been a subject of significant research during the last two decades moreover studies on ozonation fenton uv h2o2 and uv persulfate processes have even been conducted in full scale practical applications in many parts of the world arzate et al 2019 launer et al 2013 rodríguez chueca et al 2018 2019 although the interest in paa based aops for water decontamination is growing rapidly studies on paa based aops have only been conducted in laboratory and batch experiments the current research has mainly focused on emerging paa activation schemes and their feasibility for degrading model compounds these studies have also provided important new mechanistic and kinetic information the general goal of these studies is to develop convenient and economically feasible processes for removing water contaminants by paa before any practical application of paa based aops there is a need to determine the important design and operational variables such as the optimum paa dosage and the effect of various water matrices table 4 shows a summary of studies using paa based aops to eliminate organic pollutants from wastewater the general observation is that paa based aops exhibit good performance for removing a wide variety of organic pollutants including dyes phenols and pharmaceuticals as mentioned earlier the removal of some organic pollutants from aqueous solutions is in principle possible directly by paa alone but relatively large doses of paa would be required however paa based aops most often achieve better degradation efficiency for the target compounds for example hollman et al 2020 reported that 20 mg l 1 of paa alone can only remove 9 of smx after 5 h with no degradation observed for ven flu or cbz while uv c 254 nm paa showed complete degradation of all the tested pharmaceuticals 5 3 oxidation mechanisms of paa based aops for water decontamination 5 3 1 identification of main reactive species in paa based aops it is generally recognized that all the generated radical species can contribute to the degradation of organic pollutants however in order to provide insight into the degradation mechanisms of organic pollutants in paa based aops it is necessary to identify the main reactive species responsible for the degradation process according to previous studies cai et al 2017 kim et al 2020 zhang and huang 2020b it has been suggested that oh and other oxygen centered radicals such as ch3c o o and ch3c o oo play relatively important roles ch3 is considered less important due to its weaker oxidizing capacity relative to oh and its high reactivity with dissolved oxygen eq 9 on the other hand organic radicals generally have longer half lives than oh clapp et al 1994 and may therefore be more selective in attacking organic compounds in order to better understand the role of oh and the other radicals in the degradation process radical scavenging experiments combined with electron paramagnetic resonance epr or electron spin resonance esr measurements are often carried out to identify the free radical intermediates epr spectroscopy is one of the very few methods that can directly detect free radicals via a spin trap compound typically a nitrone or nitroso compound davies 2016 the spin trapping agents such as 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo can react with free radicals to form a relatively stable spin adduct which can be subsequently identified and quantified by epr while this can identify the radical species it cannot provide the information on their origin or subsequent oxidation reactions furthermore there are possible direct non radical reactions involving spin trap compounds that can produce either false negative or false positive results therefore complementary radical scavenging experiments should additionally be carried out to verify the observations and to determine the reaction rates using the technique of competition kinetics radical scavenging can be categorized as chemical probe method which relies on the difference between the reaction rates of the reference quenching agent and target compound with reactive radicals in radical scavenging experiments tert butyl alcohol tba is the most commonly used reference quenching agent while studying paa based system but methanol meoh or ethanol etoh 4 chlorobenzoicacid p cba and ascorbic acid aa have also been used tba is a well known oh scavenger k oh tba 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 but it does not react with organic radicals yang et al 2019 table 5 summarizes selected studies on paa based aops which have investigated the contribution of reactive radicals based on quenching experiments and or epr spectroscopy in uv paa process it has been suggested that primary radicals oh and ch3c o o play a main role in degrading most organic pollutants by using the tba assay cai et al 2017 found that oh was the dominant radical species responsible for the degradation of cbz and ibu during uv paa whereas ch3c o o and or ch3c o oo contributed more to the degradation of naphthyl compounds such as nap and 2 naphthoxyacetic acid similar results were also reported by chen et al 2019 where tba and p cba were used as oh quenching compounds in a uv paa system recently zhang and huang 2020b established a first comprehensive model for the reaction kinetics for uv paa that could account for the influence of uv paa h2o2 and acetate ions in the system and evaluated the reaction mechanism for producing the reactive species using kinetic modeling and the radical quenching technique employing tba for oh and 2 4 hexadiene for oh and ch3c o o the authors showed that ch3c o oo is the most abundant organic radical under uv paa oh and ch3c o oo appear to be the most important radicals for compound degradation and their production is significantly influenced by the paa h2o2 acetate composition and the uv fluence when transition metals are introduced into a paa solution the primary radicals ch3c o o and ch3c o oo were proposed to be the dominant species formed during the initial phase of the reaction wang et al 2020b used dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol tmp spin trapping agents to identify the radical species generated during co paa process the results from epr spectroscopy indicated that both ch3c o o and ch3c o oo contribute to the degradation of smx by co paa moreover through further analysis of the results from tba assay ch3c o oo was proposed to play the main role for smx degradation with ch3c o o contributing less ch3c o oo is considered as the most powerful oxidizing peroxyl radical and hence its rate constant reacting with most compounds is in the diffusion limited regime 108 109 m 1 s 1 mortensen 2001 neta et al 1990 kim et al 2020 further studied the reaction kinetics of co paa and established the dominant role of ch3c o oo in this aop using the co paa system the reactivity of 30 different aromatic compounds with ch3c o oo was assessed using a structure activity relationship the results show that the compound degradation is due to electron transfer mechanism involving ch3c o oo kim et al 2019 have used 5 diisopropoxyphosphoryl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dippmpo as a spin trap to study fe ii paa system fitting based simulations of the epr spectra revealed the presence of oh ch3co ch3c o o and ch3 radicals in the system scavenging experiments using tba indicated that organic radicals and or fe iv were the main reactive species responsible for the initial rapid degradation of methylene blue nap and bpa while oh played an important role in the secondary reactions zhou et al 2015 studied paa activated carbon fiber system by epr using 4 hydroxy 5 5 dimethyl 2 trifluorome thylpyrroline 1 oxide fdmpo as the spin trapping reagent they observed both hydroxyl and carbon centered radical adducts during this reaction which were identified based on their isotropic hyperfine coupling constants however scavenging experiments using tba revealed that oh played only a minor role in the removal of red dye in this system 5 3 2 reactions of organic compounds in paa based aops reaction mechanisms for aqueous solutions containing free radicals and organic compounds can involve various radical intermediates and include complex secondary reactions however in most cases the reactions responsible for the initial phase of the mechanism are fairly well understood as mentioned earlier oh plays an important role in many paa based oxidation systems the hydroxyl radical is an electrophilic agent with well documented chemistry it can react with organic compounds through hydrogen atom abstraction add to unsaturated bonds double bonds and aromatic rings and participate in electron transfer reactions cooper et al 2009 liu et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 peroxyl radicals ch3c o o and ch3c o oo which play important roles in paa based aops can react with organic compounds in a similar way as oh neta et al 1990 however due to the difference in their redox capability peroxyl radicals and oh tend to show quite different reactivity towards organic pollutants while oh is non selective and extremely reactive towards nearly all organic compounds the reactivity of ch3c o o and ch3c o oo is more selective towards electron rich sites gonzalez cuervo kozlov süss fink and shul pin 2004 for uv paa cai et al 2017 indicated that ch3c o o and or ch3c o oo contributed significantly to the rapid degradation of nap but not cbz or ibu the naphthalene ring in naproxen molecule could be easily attacked by the peroxyl radicals peroxyl radicals were also suggested as the main reactive species for degrading smx in co paa which preferentially attack the nh2 group of smx through hydrogen atom abstraction step et al 1994 wang et al 2020b in general ch3c o oo and ch3c o o can attack alkanes by hydrogen atom abstraction for example in the latter case it has been observed that ch3c o o can oxidize phenol by this mechanism which led to the formation of ring cleavage products rokhina et al 2010 however most studies conclude that the reactions involving peroxyl radicals proceed via electron transfer ch3c o oo has been reported to react rapidly with 2 2 4 trimethyl 1 3 pentanediol tmpd 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid abts and ascorbate by this mechanism schuchmann and von sonntag 1988 kim et al 2019 also proposed that the degradation of methylene blue nap and bpa by fe ii paa was initiated by electron transfer from the target compound to ch3c o o and or ch3c o oo by assessing the structure activity relationship between 30 different aromatic compounds molecular descriptors and their pseudo first order degradation rate constants in co paa process kim et al 2020 concluded that electron transfer is the main reaction between ch3c o oo and aromatic compounds however direct experimental evidence for electron transfer to ch3c o o ch3c o oo is relatively limited therefore more investigations are needed to confirm this theory 5 4 influence of water matrix and operational parameters the performance of aops for removing organic compounds can be affected by the water matrix and various experimental parameters such as ph catalyst dosage the oxidizing agent used and the presence of anions and nom it is generally recognized that increasing the catalyst and oxidant dosages can enhance the degradation efficiency but excessive concentrations may lead to radical scavenging and result in decrease in the performance olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 yang et al 2019 in general the ph and the presence of nom and anionic species often influence aops in a complex manner in order to optimize paa based aops all of these parameters must be considered in detail 5 4 1 paa dosage in paa based aops the reactive radical species are mainly formed due to the activation of paa thus the paa dosage is a crucial factor influencing the efficiency of paa based aops in general an increase in paa dosage leads to better degradation performance for example as the paa dosage was increased from 5 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 the degradation rate of venlafaxine ven cbz fluoxetine flu and smx was observed to increase linearly hollman et al 2020 similarly kim et al 2020 evaluated the effect of paa dosage on cbz degradation during 30 min treatment with co ii paa where the degradation efficiency increased from 24 3 to 91 9 when the paa concentration was increased from 20 to 200 μm the enhancement of the degradation efficiency is likely due to the increase in radical generation the formation of reactive radicals in uv paa process has been quantitatively studied by zhang and huang 2020b where the steady state concentrations of ch3c o o and ch3c o oo were significantly increased when the paa dosage grew from 40 to 500 μm the study by wang et al 2020a showed that increasing the paa dosage from 50 to 400 μm improved smx removal efficiency significantly in fe2 zeolite paa aop however when the paa dosage was increased to more than 400 μm no improvement in smx degradation was observed which likely resulted from the radical scavenging effect of the excess amount of paa moreover in uv paa aop the excess paa will absorb the uv light which could reduce the direct photolysis of the target compounds zhang et al 2020a 5 4 2 presence of h2o2 and acetate ions since commercial paa solutions always contain h2o2 the possible contribution of h2o2 during paa based treatments cannot be ignored kim et al 2019 have evaluated the effect of h2o2 on degradation of methylene blue in a fe ii paa system and the results indicate that increasing the relative h2o2 concentration enhances the overall methylene blue removal efficiency from 87 2 to 100 however in fe2 zeolite paa wang et al 2020a and co paa systems wang et al 2020b the co existing h2o2 was found to play a negligible role in the study by kim et al 2020 additional h2o2 was dosed into the co paa system to investigate the influence of h2o2 on cbz degradation it was observed that increasing h2o2 concentration from 31 to 200 μm reduced the removal efficiency from 81 2 to 39 6 in a study by wang et al 2020b the presence of h2o2 did not influence the decay of paa in a co paa system which suggested that there is no decomposition mechanism that would involve both paa and h2o2 simultaneously both wang et al 2020b and kim et al 2020 indicated that the inhibitory effect of additional h2o2 on cbz degradation was likely due to the scavenging of acetyl per oxyl radicals by h2o2 eq 29 eq 30 moreover o2 produced from the deprotonation of ho2 can also rapidly react with ch3c o oo eq 31 von sonntag and schuchmann 1991 29 h 2 o 2 c h 3 c o oo ho 2 c h 3 c o ooh 30 h 2 o 2 c h 3 c o o ho 2 c h 3 c o oh 31 o 2 c h 3 c o oo o 2 c h 3 c o o o both ho2 and o2 have a weaker oxidizing capacity and therefore the compound degradation was inhibited at high concentrations of h2o2 however the scavenging of ch3c o oo by h2o2 becomes less significant when paa is in excess of h2o2 which is supported by the quantitative analysis of zhang and huang 2020b furthermore the study by zhang and huang 2020b showed that increasing the h2o2 concentration in uv paa produces higher amounts of oh when the h2o2 0 paa 0 ratio exceeded 5 it is worth noting that when treating saline water with paa based processes the presence of h2o2 can eliminate the formation of hypohalous acids e g hocl hobr or hoi which minimizes the formation of brominated or chlorinated by products shah et al 2015 in addition to h2o2 a high concentration of acetic acid is also present in equilibrium paa therefore it is necessary to evaluate the role of acetate anion in paa based aops acetate anion can become a radical scavenger especially for oh oh can react with the acetate anion by h abstraction yielding carbon centered radical ch2c o o eq 32 which can further react with dissolved oxygen to form ooch2c o o eq 33 fig 3 buxton et al 1988 schuchmann et al 1985 32 c h 3 co o oh c h 2 co o h 2 o 33 c h 2 co o o 2 ooc h 2 co o the influence of acetic acid in present paa based treatments has not been studied systematically so far based on the study by zhang and huang 2020b the presence of acetate anions reduces the oh concentration 5 4 3 catalyst dosage instead of increasing the oxidizer concentration the degradation efficiency can also be enhanced by including a catalyst in the aop wang et al 2020b found that the decomposition of paa increased significantly when the co catalyst dose in a co paa system was increased thus provided that non radical pathways are suppressed this catalyst increases the radical production and consequently the target pollutant degradation efficiency in heterogeneous catalysis increasing the dosage means that there are more active catalytic sites available gao et al 2017 yang et al 2019 for instance wu et al 2020 reported that the degradation efficiency of orange g og in co3o4 paa system improved from zero to 79 when increasing the catalyst loading from 0 to 0 01 g l 1 a similar improvement was also observed in degradation of smx by fe2 zeolite paa aop wang et al 2020a where the smx removal rate constants increased from 0 013 to 0 13 min 1 with the dosage of fe2 zeolite increasing from 0 2 to 0 8 g l 1 however when the catalyst dosage was increased to 1 0 g l 1 the rate constant decreased to 0 077 min 1 due to aggregation and sedimentation of the catalyst a too high catalyst concentration may lead to radical scavenging by the catalyst which reduces the efficiency of the treatment for example kim et al 2019 investigated the effect of fe ii dosage 20 500 μm in fe ii paa degradation of methylene blue the results showed that the removal rate of methylene blue 63 1 75 did not change significantly at doses between 20 100 μm whereas the rate decreased to 46 0 at 500 μm this was proposed to be due to the consumption of the reactive radicals by the excess amount of fe ii catalyst kim et al 2020 reported that cbz removal efficiency improved from 30 5 to 97 7 after 30 min when increasing the co ii concentration from 1 to 100 μm it was found that pseudo first order rate constant for degradation of cbz by co paa grew linearly when co ii dosage was increased from 1 to 20 μm this indicates that radical i e ch3c o oo scavenging by cobalt ions is not significant when paa co however the growth became non linear when the co ii concentration was more than 20 μm and the inhibitory effect of co ii on cbz degradation was observed when paa co in the latter case the reduced efficiency is likely due to high radical scavenging efficiency of the excess cobalt ions 5 4 4 influence of ph in paa based aops the solution ph is a crucial parameter which significantly affects the chemistry of the radicals catalysts oxidants as well as the target compounds firstly the ph influences the paa acid base equilibrium and hence the generation of the reactive radical species since the pka value of paa is 8 2 the protonated form paa0 is more dominant below ph 8 2 and the deprotonated form paa above this ph paa has a higher molar absorption coefficient than paa0 at 254 nm which leads to faster photolysis of paa compared to paa0 cai et al 2017 zhang and huang 2020b based on this observation more reactive radicals should be generated during alkaline uv paa process for example mukhopadhyay and daswat 2014 reported that the optimal ph for 4 chlorophenol degradation by uv paa aop is 9 5 when the effect of ph was studied systematically in the range 4 9 5 however employing highly alkaline conditions e g ph 11 may exhibit adverse effects on uv paa performance due to the decreased redox potential of the reactive radicals e g oh and the competition between oh and the target compounds for oh zhang et al 2020a as for metal catalytic processes the ph can affect the formation of transition metal species that can react with the oxidant in a fe2 zeolite paa system fe2 in the zeolite structure may exchange h under acidic conditions or transform to hydroxide under alkaline conditions thus neutral solution was considered to best for fe2 activity wang et al 2020a kim et al 2020 reported that the optimal ph range for compound degradation by co paa was 5 0 ph 7 1 while more acidic or basic conditions inhibited the degradation the ph of the solution influences the speciation of co ii co iii ions paa and the target compounds the work by kim et al 2020 suggested that protonation deprotonation of paa should be the main ph related factor influencing the decomposition rate in co paa system in addition during heterogeneous activation of paa ph can also affect the surface charges of the metal oxide for example neutral ph was found to be optimal for co3o4 paa aop due to the favorable electrostatic interaction between paa0 and the catalyst surface wu et al 2020 under acidic conditions a hydrogen bond forms between the excess h and the o o fragment of paa which hinders paa s interaction with the positively charged co3o4 catalyst surface on the other hand under alkaline conditions electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged oxide surface and paa would similarly reduce the interaction with the catalyst finally the solution ph can also affect the pollutant chemicals and change their reactivity towards oxidants for example smx mainly exists in its deprotonated form at ph greater than 5 6 smx pka1 is 1 8 and pka2 5 6 which is more reactive toward the radicals formed in aops ao and liu 2017 5 4 5 presence of anions several anions naturally found in water can affect the ability of activated paa to degrade aqueous contaminants chloride ion cl is one of the main inorganic anions that is present in almost all natural waters paa can react directly with chloride to form secondary oxidant hocl shah et al 2015 when chloride is present during aop it has been suggested to react with oh to produce various reactive chlorine containing species including cl cloh and cl2 similarly for peroxyl radicals cl can also act as a scavenger yielding chlorine containing species chen et al 2019 shah et al 2015 zhang et al 2020a 34 c l c h 3 c o ooh hocl c h 3 co o 35 c l oh hoc l 36 c l c h 3 c o oo h cl c h 3 c o ooh 37 cl h 2 o hoc l h 38 cl c l cl 2 in general chlorine containing species tend to have weaker oxidizing capacity than oh but they can also show higher selectivity towards certain compounds thus the impact of cl on the degradation process depends on the target compound chen et al 2019 found that cl 0 200 mm had negligible effect on the degradation of naproxen in uv paa process the work by kim et al 2020 shows that the presence of cl 100 1000 μm had little impact on cbz degradation by co paa similar results were also reported by wu et al 2020 and zhang et al 2020a for smx a significant negative impact on the degradation efficiency was observed in fe2 zeolite paa aop wang et al 2020a carbonate co3 2 and bicarbonate hco3 ions mainly contribute to the alkalinity of water both ions are well known radical scavengers co3 2 and hco3 can quench oh and so4 to generate less reactive co3 and hco3 izadifard et al 2017 co3 2 0 500 μm showed a notable negative effect on smx removal efficiency in fe2 zeolite paa aop because oh is the main reactive radical species responsible for degrading smx however for systems in which peroxyl radicals play the main role the inhibition effect of co3 2 hco3 may not be so pronounced previous studies cai et al 2017 chen et al 2019 have indicated that co3 2 hco3 could not scavenge peroxyl radicals including ch3c o oo suggesting that the reaction rate constant between co3 2 hco3 and those radicals is small for instance co3 2 hco3 0 20 mm had a minimal effect on nap degradation during uv paa process chen et al 2019 on the other hand the inhibiting effect of hco3 was still observed in co paa kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020b and co3o4 paa systems wu et al 2020 where peroxyl radicals play an important role this has been attributed to the formation of nonreactive co2 hco3 complexes xu et al 2011 nitrate ion no3 is a well known photosensitizer which often influences the efficiency of photochemical processes park et al 2010 on one hand no3 can absorb uv photons to reduce the direct photolysis of compounds and on the other hand no3 can undergo uv photolysis leading to secondary reactions to produce oh that can further degrade the target compounds 39 no 3 h 2 o h v no 2 oh oh zhang et al 2020a reported enhanced removal efficiency for diclofenac by uv paa in the presence of no3 which demonstrates that the overall positive effect of including no3 can outweigh the negatives 5 4 6 contribution of nom nom is a ubiquitous complex constituent in natural waters which typically consists of humic substances hs including humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa nom may enhance or inhibit the degradation of target organic contaminants on one hand as a photosensitizer nom is able to photogenerate oh to enhance the degradation process but nom can also act as a radical scavenger wu et al 2020 observed a clear inhibitory effect of ha 0 20 mg l 1 on the degradation efficiency of og by co3o4 paa in the study by kim et al 2020 the addition of ha 1 10 mg l 1 reduced the cbz degradation efficiency by 69 4 during 30 min of co paa process this phenomenon was also reported by zhang et al 2020a where the removal of diclofenac was reduced in the presence of nom during uv paa treatment ha can scavenge peroxyl radicals with a reaction rate constant of 104 l mg 1 s 1 which is comparable to oh chen et al 2019 comparative studies between paa based and other commonly used aops for pollutant degradation will help to better understand the relative performance the aops for water decontamination applications zhang et al 2020a reported that the degradation rate constants of diclofenac followed the order k uv paa 0 1161 min 1 k uv persulfate 0 1071 min 1 k uv h2o2 0 0857 min 1 hollman et al 2020 concluded that for the same oxidant dosage approximately 50 mg l 1 uv h2o2 was faster than uv paa for removing ven flu or cbz whereas only smx was degraded faster by uv paa luukkonen et al 2015 compared the efficiency of h2o2 and paa for the oxidation of bpa in the presence of fe2 or cu2 and their results indicated that commercial paa was slightly more effective than h2o2 generally the performance of paa based aops for pollutant degradation can be considered comparable to the h2o2 based processes 6 paa based aops for water disinfection disinfection of drinking water and wastewater effluents is essential since they may contain pathogenic bacteria fungi and viruses that can cause immediate adverse health effects on the population using chemicals such as chlorine to remove pathogenic species from water has been widely applied in the water treatment industry gad allah et al 2017 liu et al 2018 otter et al 2020 however the chemical disinfectants can react with organic compounds present in the water and generate toxic dbps furthermore some emerging waterborne pathogens such as cryptosporidium and giardia are resistant to these traditional chemical disinfection approaches you et al 2019 for these reasons the highly reactive radicals produced during aops have attracted increasing attention in disinfection applications xiao et al 2019 in fact using aops for the inactivation of microorganisms is a relatively new area and most of the studies were carried out within the last two decades paa is an emerging chemical disinfectant which has been proven to exhibit excellent antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms the byproducts of paa disinfection are primarily comprised of carboxylic acids which exhibit no toxicity or mutagenicity therefore paa based aops may provide a new strategy for the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms moreover the implementation of paa disinfection allows an easy and relatively inexpensive upgrade of the existing chlorination equipment however paa alone may not be sufficiently effective when higher inactivation rates are required e g in wastewater reuse applications furthermore a high paa dose may increase the effluent organic content resulting in enhanced microbial regrowth previous studies formisano et al 2016 hassaballah et al 2020 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b have demonstrated that the improvement of microorganism inactivation in water during paa based aops is due to the formation of reactive radical species however only a few investigations have focused on testing the effectiveness of paa based aops for water disinfection but the increasing number of reports published on this subject is indicative of its good developmental prospects 6 1 efficiency of microorganism inactivation by paa based aops only a limited number of studies on paa based aops for inactivating pathogenic microorganisms have been reported as summarized in table 6 in order to characterize the disinfection efficiency the disinfection rate is used which is calculated as the logarithm of the ratio between the concentration of microorganisms at a given time and the initial concentration among these studies uv paa is the most commonly used technology for water and wastewater disinfection to reduce the treatment cost due consumption of electricity some researchers have explored the possibility of using sunlight paa for water disinfection formisano et al 2016 demonstrated that sunlight paa can achieve a high inactivation rate 3 52 and 4 50 log reduction for e coli and enterococci respectively after 120 min of solar irradiation with a paa dose of 8 mg l 1 rizzo et al 2019 also evaluated the effect of sunlight paa on the inactivation of antibiotic resistant form of e coli and reported that the inactivation rate of sunlight paa was higher compared to sunlight alone for gw the best performance was achieved after 30 min with 0 2 mg l 1 of paa and cumulative uv light energy supply quv of 4 40 kj l 1 whereas for ww the best performance and lod limit of detection 2 cfu ml 1 was achieved with 10 mg l 1 paa and 2 min irradiation quv 0 28 kj l 1 uv tio2 aop has been more intensively studied as an alternative disinfection technique interestingly paa can also be applied in uv tio2 process to achieve better inactivation performance drosou et al 2010 has investigated the efficiency of uv a tio2 and ultrasound uv a tio2 in the presence of paa for inactivating e coli suspensions paa assisted uv a tio2 photocatalysis could generally achieve total inactivation of e coli after 10 20 min of treatment 0 5 2 mg l 1 of paa 100 500 mg l 1 of tio2 moreover the e coli inactivation efficiency could be further enhanced by ultrasound paa ultrasound uv a tio2 process in addition to uv light activation metal catalysts have also been used in this field e g ag paa and ag cu2 paa de velásquez et al 2008 luna pabello et al 2009 as shown in table 6 various microorganisms including bacteria viruses and protozoa were reportedly inactivated by paa based aops most studies have been conducted using strains of e coli since this bacterium is considered as an indicator of fecal contamination in aquatic environments vinet and zhedanov 2011 and it has well known structure and composition it was shown that paa based aops generally exhibit excellent performance for eliminating e coli paa based aops for eliminating other bacteria which are frequently detected and often used as indicator microorganisms in waste water e g enterococcus sp salmonella sp pseudomonas aeruginosa shigella sp v cholerae have also been studied in the literature it has been observed that the cellular structure of the microorganism can influence the inactivation efficiency for example enterococcus sp is more resistant to paa only disinfection than e coli with 1 2 logs lower efficiency at comparable exposures hassaballah et al 2020 uv paa as a combined treatment appeared to achieve a higher inactivation efficiency than paa alone for e coli 3 1 3 6 logs and enterococcus sp 1 4 logs but there is still an efficiency gap between these two strains of bacteria however de velásquez et al 2008 found that ag paa could achieve good overall inactivation efficiency for various bacteria including v cholerae 4 2 logs salmonella sp 3 2 logs shigella sp 3 9 logs and p aeruginosa 3 7 logs therefore in order to better understand the feasibility of paa based aops as new alternative disinfection technologies the response of various bacteria to paa based aops must be systematically studied it is worth mentioning that antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistant genes args can be found in numerous aquatic environments due to the heavy use of antibiotics nowadays which have become a major threat for human health and a serious challenge for waste water treatment the direct influence of paa based aops on arb and args has not received much attention thus far and only rizzo et al 2019 have reported inactivation of antibiotic resistant form of e coli resistant to smx by uv paa and sunlight paa treatments in both paa and chlorine based disinfection treatments viruses tend to require higher exposures than bacteria in order to reach comparable levels of inactivation hassaballah et al 2020 however some previous studies have indicated that synergistic effects in paa based aops are slightly lower for viruses than for bacteria for example koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 found that combined uv paa disinfection treatment of enteric bacteria achieved significant synergy benefits while the treatment of coliphage ms2 did not show any similarly guerra rodríguez et al 2018 reported only slight synergy in uv paa based reduction of infectivity at paa doses commonly employed at wastewater treatment plants 0 5 2 mg l 1 the observed reduced synergy was likely due to the presence of radical scavengers in the wastewater samples hassaballah et al 2020 reported that uv paa treatment could achieve a maximum log reduction of 2 7 for somatic coliphage and 4 7 log reduction for e coli similar results were also obtained earlier by hassaballah et al 2019 beber de souza et al 2015 reported high inactivation of both e coli and coliphages with 5 log microorganism reduction in uv paa treated water protozoa are even less susceptible to paa and chlorine than viruses and bacteria up to date only hassaballah et al 2020 have investigated inactivation of cryptosporidium parvum by uv paa but their results were inconclusive whether cryptosporidium parvum oocysts were more susceptible to paa uv or both future work is needed to resolve this issue 6 2 inactivation mechanisms by paa alone the mechanism of disinfection by paa alone without activation is still under investigation some researchers have suggested that paa functions in a similar way as the other peroxides and oxidizing agents during disinfection fraise et al 2013 alternative theory is that paa may release reactive oxygen species which act as the disinfectant liberti and notarnicola 1999 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 the protonated form of paa paa0 which exists below ph 8 2 is thought to be the biocidal form whereas the deprotonated form paa is not wagner et al 2002 paa can oxidize sulfhydryl sh and disulphide s s bonds in proteins and enzymes and then the important components in the membranes and inside the cell would become dysfunctional flores et al 2014 mcfadden et al 2017 sánchez ruiz et al 1995 previous research has put forward several specific inactivation mechanisms for paa kitis 2004 paa could disrupt the chemiosmotic function of the lipoprotein cytoplasmic membrane and transport through dislocation or rupture of cell walls leaper 2007 intracellular paa could also play a role in the inactivation of the catalase enzyme which inhibits hydroxyl radical oxidation fraser et al 1985 its action as a protein denaturant may explain its disinfection effectiveness against spores in addition it was suggested that paa can release hydroxyl radicals which oxidize proteins and lipids to compromise bacterial cell walls lipid peroxidation and to denature cellular dna coyle et al 2014 lubello et al 2002 the h2o2 contained in the commercial paa solutions appeared to play a less important role during disinfection processes koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 as an organic peroxide paa may penetrate more efficiently microbial cells than h2o2 molecules leading to the enhancement of its disinfection properties via disruption of cell membranes and blockage of enzymatic and transport systems in microorganisms in addition some microorganisms may be protected against h2o2 due to their catalase enzyme activity while this enzyme does not protect against paa wagner et al 2002 6 3 inactivation mechanisms of paa based aops radical formation by paa can be enhanced by combining the treatment with other methods most studies in this field have utilized uv irradiation for activating paa to eliminate microorganisms caretti and lubello 2003 hassaballah et al 2019 vankerckhoven et al 2011 previous work has demonstrated that addition of paa before uv irradiation uv paa produces better disinfection results than uv alone paa alone or uv applied before paa caretti and lubello 2003 the effect of bacterial inactivation resulting from the uv paa method is greater than the sum of the individual effects confirming the synergy between the two treatments beber de souza et al 2015 uv radiation can cause direct damage to nucleic acids while chemical disinfectants may attack microbial cell walls membranes and enzymatic or transport systems hassaballah et al 2020 different types of injuries induced by uv and paa may limit the microorganisms ability to repair cellular structures in addition the generated radicals by uv paa can also act as disinfectants sun et al 2018 therefore under uv paa multiple mechanisms are present including uv irradiation paa and reactive radicals leading to the possibility that a synergistic effect among all of these mechanisms could potentially be involved in microorganism inactivation zhang et al 2020b zhang et al 2020b have investigated the mechanism of uv paa disinfection for three bacteria e coli e durans and s epidermidis in that study the radicals generated under uv paa played a greater role in inactivating e coli than e durans and s epidermidis the contribution of radicals to the overall inactivation was moderate a larger contribution from the synergistic effect was observed in the inactivation of s epidermidis and e coli and could at least be partially attributed to the diffusion of paa into the cells as mentioned in 4 1 1 the free radicals generated in uv paa process are mainly oh ch3c o o and ch3c o oo with oh being a more efficient disinfectant sun et al 2018 investigated the role of free radicals in inactivation of e coli during uv paa process in the presence of an excess amount of tba the results indicated that oh was the main species responsible for the inactivation while organic radicals played a negligible role in general oh can inactivate microorganisms by destruction of i cell membrane wall ii enzymes and iii genetic materials bai et al 2018 zoschke et al 2014 fig 5 firstly oh can induce oxidation and disruption of the lipids in the cell wall and membrane which perturbs its structure and permeability moreover as an electrophilic agent oh exhibits high reactivity towards many enzymes such as lysozyme and ribonuclease finally genetic materials such as dna and rna present in microorganisms can become mutated when attacked by oh de velásquez et al 2008 and luna pabello et al 2009 have evaluated the efficiency of paa in disinfecting advanced primary treatment apt effluent by combining the oxidant with cu2 and ag in these studies the synergy between paa and ag for removing various microorganism such as v cholerae salmonella sp shigella p aeruginosa helminth eggs and fecal coliforms was observed addition of cu and or ag ions decreased the required contact time for disinfection the proposed mechanism of this synergistic action shows some differences when compared with the uv paa process in addition to generating more free radicals unstable and toxic metal oxides such as ag2o ag2o2 and cu2o were produced during the oxidation of ag and cu which are significantly more effective disinfectants than the cu ag ions themselves davies and etris 1997 6 4 disinfection by uv paa treatment photochemical technologies are simple environmental friendly and cost effective in many water treatment applications with possible dual action for removing environmental contaminants and disinfection in photo driven aops application of uv based treatments is expected to increase since the use of uv in water and wastewater treatment is well known and widely implemented the inactivation of waterborne pathogens by uv mainly uv c light is due to damaging the nucleic acids dna rna in cells and viruses and hence uv disinfection is regarded as being broadly effective against various kinds of microorganisms including pathogens bacteria protozoa and viruses hijnen et al 2006 however there are several uv resistant organisms e g adenoviruses which require higher uv doses to disinfect and therefore increase the cost of the treatment combined disinfection methods consist of using two or more disinfectants simultaneously or sequentially which may provide enhancement of the microbial inactivation efficiency this includes synergistic benefits reduced formation of dbps and smaller doses of disinfecting agents required beber de souza et al 2015 up to date proposed combined waste water disinfection treatments include uv based aops such as uv tio2 cho et al 2002 uv chlorine mounaouer and abdennaceur 2016 and uv h2o2 sun et al 2016 recently uv paa has attracted growing interest for inactivating microorganisms in addition to experiments carried out on laboratory scale some pilot scale studies employing uv paa have been reported in recent years caretti and lubello 2003 conducted a pilot plant experiment using uv paa for disinfecting wwtp secondary effluent with a high concentration of total coliforms about 6 logs mpn 100 ml 1 total inactivation of the tested microorganisms e g coliforms e coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa was reached with 2 mg l 1 of paa and 165 mj cm 2 of uv 254 nm vankerckhoven et al 2011 examined uv paa disinfection of municipal water in a pilot scale system using a mixed bacterial suspension a combination of 2 3 mg l 1 paa and uv uv dose 234 mj cm 2 resulted in 4 0 log cfu ml 1 after 72 h of treatment similar results were also reported by hassaballah et al 2019 where it was observed that uv paa treatment paa 45 135 mg min l 1 uv dose 30 mj cm 2 exhibited better inactivation efficiency than paa alone for somatic coliphage in secondary effluent and for fecal coliforms e coli and somatic coliphage in tertiary effluent the synergy in uv paa treatment involves multiple degradation mechanisms as discussed in section 6 2 uv paa is the most intensively studied paa based aop which is expected to find practical full scale use in the near future a summary of laboratory and pilot scale studies of uv paa disinfection is provided in table 6 moreover other aspects of uv paa disinfection such as inactivation kinetics influence of the process operational parameters and presence of water matrices as well as comparisons with other disinfection methods are described in the following sections 6 4 1 inactivation kinetics and synergistic effects analysis of the inactivation kinetics helps to better understand the disinfection process and evaluate its performance the precursor concentration c mol l 1 and exposure time t min are the main factors for determining the required disinfectant dosage the most widely used model for estimating bacterial inactivation is the chick s law which is based on a log linear relationship 40 log n n 0 k t where n n0 is the bacterial or spore concentration reduction ratio k is the inactivation rate constant which is model dependent and t is the contact time min this model reduces the disinfection process to a bimolecular chemical reaction in which microorganisms are treated as molecular species romero martínez et al 2019 ferreira et al 2020 have shown that the disinfection kinetics in photochemical disinfection processes generally follow the chick s law macintyre et al 2018 however as an emerging disinfection technology existing studies on modeling the inactivation under uv paa process are fairly limited formisano et al 2016 found that chick s pseudo first order rate law was suitable for describing uv paa inactivation of e coli and enterococci with statistical r2 very close to 1 however azzellino et al 2011 showed that inactivation of total and fecal coliforms as well as e coli by paa treatment in secondary effluent could be described by two non linear models hom s model and s model sun et al 2018 analyzed e coli inactivation kinetics of uv paa and uv paa by using the hom s model eq 41 which is an empirical generalization of chick s pseudo first order rate law gyürék and finch 1998 41 log n n 0 k c t 3 where k is the disinfection rate constant c is the disinfectant concentration and t is the treatment time in order to determine and quantify the synergistic effects in uv paa treatment eq 42 has been applied koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 the synergy is present when the inactivation efficiency from the sequential combined action is higher than the sum of the individual inactivation treatments 42 synergy lo g uv paa lo g paa lo g uv where loguv paa is the reduction of infectivity by uv paa logpaa is the reduction of infectivity by paa only and loguv is the reduction of infectivity by uv irradiation only 6 4 2 effect of operational parameters generally operational parameters like uv and paa doses influence the inactivation efficiency of uv paa based processes formisano et al 2016 investigated the effect of paa dose on the inactivation of bacteria during uv paa treatment at varying concentrations 4 8 12 mg l 1 and found that the lowest paa dose investigated 4 mg l 1 only reached a very limited inactivation of bacteria 60 5 and 53 1 removal after 20 min treatment for e coli and enterococci respectively however when the paa dose was increased to 8 or 12 mg l 1 the disinfection efficiency improved significantly one possible reason for this phenomenon is that the low paa concentration did not produce a sufficient amount of free radicals during the process rizzo et al 2019 similarly increasing the uv exposure generally leads to increased microbial inactivation due to the enhancement of both free radical formation and direct uv inactivation zeng et al 2020 furthermore considering both the inactivation effectiveness and the economic cost optimized uv and paa doses should be determined furthermore the ph impacts the solubility of cellular components especially proteins for instance the acid tolerance response in e coli involves acid induced proteins which can protect the cells from an acid shock amiri et al 2010 moreover ph can also influence the generation of reactive radicals in uv paa systems leading to changes in the disinfection performance castillo ledezma et al 2011 xiao et al 2019 temperature may play an important role in the inactivation processes by influencing the metabolism of microorganisms the yield of reactive radicals and the efficiency of chemical reactions between disinfectants and microorganisms however the systematic effects of ph and temperature on the inactivation of microorganisms by uv paa have still not yet been determined in detail thus further investigation on this topic is needed 6 4 3 influence of water composition on disinfection performance wastewater composition often affects the inactivation performance of disinfectants it has been shown that turbidity suspended solids and organic matter can decrease the disinfection efficiency by paa penetration of uv light and hence its efficiency depends on factors such as turbidity uv254 an indicator for total organic carbon and the presence of nh3 n in water hassaballah et al 2020 furthermore wastewater may also contain radical scavengers that reduce the effectiveness of the applied aop weng et al 2018 demonstrated that despite the radicals being formed during uv paa treatment the viruses had reduced opportunity to encounter them in municipal wastewater secondary effluent than in a phosphate buffer solution pbs because of the presence of radical scavengers on the contrary in the study by hassaballah et al 2020 no clear trend between wastewater characteristics and log reductions was observed which may be due to a limited number of wastewater samples used with varying compositions 6 4 4 comparison with uv h2o2 among the various aops the combination of h2o2 and uv light uv h2o2 exhibits a strong synergistic effect which has recently been the subject of great interest for inactivating pathogens in water sun et al 2016 timchak and gitis 2012 previous studies have investigated uv h2o2 and compared its efficiency with uv paa lubello et al 2002 investigated the efficiency of uv paa and uv h2o2 in both laboratory and pilot scale experiments fed by secondary effluent from two municipal wastewater treatment plants the results show that while uv paa and uv h2o2 have the same cost effectiveness uv paa requires lower doses for the same disinfection performance koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 observed increased disinfection efficiency and synergistic effects for all the target enteric bacteria in uv paa treatment while uv h2o2 treatment only slightly influenced the microbial reduction compared to uv alone formisano et al 2016 showed that a lower disinfectant dosage was required in uv paa treatment than uv h2o2 to achieve the same inactivation rate which demonstrates that uv paa is a promising technology for water disinfection 7 opportunities and challenges in paa based aops in summary we have provided an up to date review on the removal of chemical and microbiological pollutants by paa based aops paa based aops were discussed as effective emerging technologies for water decontamination and disinfection many strategies have been developed to activate radical generation from paa which include the most prominent methods based on external energy input e g uv and solar irradiation transition metals and activated carbon catalysts in addition to oh radicals organic per oxyl radicals can also be generated during paa based aops which appear to be more selective in reacting with organic compounds both oh and organic per oxyl radicals contribute to the degradation of organic compounds in water while oh plays a more important role in inactivation of microorganisms paa based aops can be applied to degrade various hazardous organic contaminants such as dyes phenols and pharmaceuticals the degradation efficiency is determined by key parameters such as paa catalyst doses co exiting h2o2 and acetate concentrations solution ph as well as the presence of inorganic anions and nom in the water moreover paa based aops have also shown promise for the inactivation of microorganisms over traditional disinfection methods that may lead to the formation of harmful dbps paa based aops haven been proven to be efficient for the inactivation of microorganisms including bacteria viruses and protozoa in water through the synergistic effects among paa based aops uv paa has attracted the most attention for water disinfection because of the wide use of uv disinfection in waste water treatment plants and the low production of secondary pollution however the published literature has identified several practical challenges in the application of paa based aops first the studied activation methods of paa are mainly based on uv irradiation and metal catalysis the energy cost associated with uv treatment depends on the water quality in a complex way and regardless whether considering a homogeneous or heterogeneous process metal catalysts can inevitably leak metal ions into the treated water which poses a potential environmental risk thus there is a need to develop and validate new effective and eco friendly activation methods for paa secondly the information on the feasibility of paa based aops for the removal of chemical and microbiological pollutants is still rather limited studies on the degradation of emerging contaminants such as endocrine disrupters edcs persistent organic pollutants pops and dbps have largely not been performed yet furthermore for disinfection applications the existing studies have mainly focused on the inactivation of bacteria but other microorganisms such as fungi and algae have not been studied thus far furthermore the effect of paa based aops on bacterial biofilms has received very little attention which would be important to study as most microorganisms growing as biofilms sessile growth form rather than planktonic cells therefore further investigations on the efficiency of paa based aops for pollution control in water should be carried out in most laboratory scale experiments the degradation of organic contaminants by paa based aops is conducted in deionized water with controlled initial concentrations of the target compounds although a couple of research studies on the inactivation of microorganisms by uv paa were conducted in pilot scale experiments employing real wastewater there is still a long way to extend the technology to full scale implementation based on the progress achieved so far and identification of the open questions for disinfection and contaminant degradation by paa based aops in water we suggest the following future topics for research 1 development of new cost effective and environment friendly paa activation methods solar irradiation is one obvious solution that could be studied more actively for paa activation either photolytic or heat activation furthermore other new energy based approaches such as gamma irradiation and ultrasound should be investigated in more detail metal free carbonaceous materials are promising catalysts for paa activation that can minimize the release of dissolved metal ions and therefore the development of new carbonaceous catalysts would reduce the environmental impact of the method 2 systematic investigation of the feasibility of paa based aops for degradation of contaminants and inactivation of microorganisms especially for emerging contaminants and pathogenic microorganisms in water the degradation inactivation kinetics the influence of operational factors and water matrix and the degradation inactivation mechanisms should be systematically determined in order to comprehensively evaluate the technology in addition simultaneous degradation of organic micro pollutants and microbial inactivation in water by paa based aops requires more attention 3 pilot scale studies to demonstrate the scalability of paa based aops for decontamination and or inactivation as uv light treatment is a mature disinfection technology that is extensively used in waste water treatment uv paa has potential as a scalable technology prior to any full scale treatment suitable reactor design for the paa based aop system must be developed and the economic feasibility of the method should be assessed 4 evaluation of the potential environmental impact of paa based aops the existing studies have mostly concentrated on the efficiency of contaminant microorganism removal but the identification of possibly toxic degradation disinfection by products was largely neglected thus toxicity evaluation of the paa based aops should be conducted and suitable control measures be developed if any toxic by products are identified 5 residual paa and possible by product removal from paa aop treated systems in order to obtain good efficiency for water decontamination and disinfection a high concentration of paa may have to be used which may lead to an increase in the effluent organic content therefore it is imperative to develop new methods to remove or recycle the residual paa and eliminate the possible by products it may be possible to reach this goal by integrating activated carbon adsorbent or other filters into the system declaration of competing interest

17392,peracetic acid paa has attracted growing attention as an alternative oxidant and disinfectant in wastewater treatment due to the increased demand to reduce chlorine usage and control disinfection byproducts dbps these applications have stimulated new investigations on paa based advanced oxidation processes aops which can enhance water disinfection and remove micropollutants the purpose of this review is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of scientific information and experimental data reported in recent years on the applications of paa based aops for the removal of chemical and microbiological micropollutants from water and wastewater various methods of paa activation including the supply of external energy and metal metal free catalysts as well as their activation mechanisms are discussed then a review on the usage of paa based aops for contaminant degradation is given the degradation mechanisms of organic compounds and the influence of the controlling parameters of paa based treatment systems are summarized and discussed concurrently the application of paa based aops for water disinfection and the related mechanisms of microorganism inactivation are also reviewed since combining uv light with paa is the most commonly investigated paa based aop for simultaneous pathogen inactivation and micropollutant oxidation we have also focused on paa microbial inactivation kinetics together with the effects of key experimental parameters on the process moreover we have discussed the advantages and disadvantages of uv paa as an aop against the well known and established uv h2o2 finally the knowledge gaps challenges and new opportunities for research in this field are discussed this critical review will facilitate an in depth understanding of the paa based aops for water and wastewater treatment and provide useful perspectives for future research and development for paa based technologies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid advanced oxidation processes activation degradation disinfection 1 introduction increased industrialization and urbanization have reduced the availability of clean water due to associated environmental stressors such as land desertification fresh water crisis the greenhouse effect air pollution and so on moreover a growing number of emerging contaminants e g pharmaceuticals personal care products endocrine disruptors artificial sweeteners disinfection by products and pesticides are continuously introduced into the aquatic environment gogoi et al 2018 tran et al 2018 wilkinson et al 2017 which can have adverse ecotoxicological impacts as a result water pollution is becoming an increasingly complex and challenging problem increasingly public health and environmental concerns drive efforts to develop more efficient low cost and green treatment methods for water disinfection and decontamination from source to point of use in recent years many technological approaches for water and wastewater treatment have been proposed and among these technologies advanced oxidation processes aops have gained growing acceptance for water disinfection and decontamination conventional aops have shown good efficiency for eliminating chemical and microbial contaminants in water guerra rodríguez et al 2018 ibhadon and fitzpatrick 2013 xiao et al 2018 you et al 2019 moreover aops provide a strategy for combining two individual processes into one treatment step water disinfection and decontamination which further improves the cost effectiveness of the treatment tsydenova et al 2015 the main process in most aops is the in situ generation of highly reactive species such as the hydroxyl radical oh the superoxide radical o2 and the sulfate radical so4 that can destroy organic pollutants and pathogens krýsa et al 2018 currently hydroxyl radical based processes are the most studied treatments among various aops the hydroxyl radical has higher oxidation potential approx 2 72 v shah et al 2013 than other common disinfectants oxidants such as ozone chlorine and chlorine dioxide wang and wang 2018 and it is non selective in attacking target molecules which make it suitable for treating polluted water wang and xu 2012 hydroxyl radical based aops can be classified into fenton or fenton like processes brillas 2020 pereira et al 2012 ozonation zhang et al 2019 photolytic like processes wols and hofman caris 2012 and photocatalytic like processes khaki et al 2017 according to the method used for producing the radical species however the efficiency of hydroxyl radical based aops can be limited in complex water matrices containing hydroxyl radical scavengers such as the carbonate bicarbonate anion and natural organic matter nom matta et al 2011 therefore in recent years employing reactive species with higher selectivity such as the sulfate radical has gained increasing attention oh et al 2016 peracetic acid paa is an organic peroxyacid that has been widely used in various applications as a disinfectant sanitizer bleach sterilizing agent oxidizer and polymerization catalyst luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 a steadily growing number of scientific publications in recent years involving paa demonstrates the importance of these applications fig 1 according to grand view research 2016 the application of paa in water treatment processes was projected to grow at the highest compound annual growth rate cagr due to the increased sanitation awareness simplicity of application and the higher regulatory standards for water treatment compared with some of the conventional disinfectants the advantages of paa for water disinfection and microbial inactivation include a high sterilization ability a lower dependence on ph an easy technical implementation and reduced formation of toxic byproducts in the treated effluent as such paa has become a promising substitute for chlorinated disinfectants for water treatment domínguez henao turolla and antonelli 2018 in addition to its use as a disinfectant paa has the potential for degrading aqueous organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals due to its high oxidation potential du et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 more recently studies have focused on employing paa in aop by activating it using external energy or catalysts to produce the reactive species kim et al 2019 rizzo et al 2018 wang et al 2020b zhou et al 2015 furthermore synergistic effects for degrading organic contaminants and inactivating pathogens in water have been demonstrated for paa based aops hollman et al 2020 although a growing number of studies have focused on paa based aops over the past decade several open problems still exist the exact mechanisms of paa activation identification of the dominant radical species and the efficiency of paa based aops for eliminating various chemical and microbiological contaminants to the best of our knowledge there is no comprehensive review on the application of paa based aops in water treatment this paper presents a review on recent advances in paa based aops with emphasis on the elimination of chemical and microbiological pollutions from water finally new important areas for further research and development in paa based water disinfection and decontamination technologies are outlined 2 history of paa based water treatment paa was first synthetized and studied systematically in 1902 freer and novy 1902 however it was not considered as a bactericidal agent until 1955 fraise et al 2013 soon after paa gained wide acceptance as a disinfectant or oxidant in various industries such as food industry healthcare fine chemicals pulp paper and water treatment with the discovery of chloroform which is a chlorination by product in drinking water in the early 1970s bellar et al 1974 the presence of such toxic disinfection by products dbps have become a growing public health concern this observation has prompted the search for alternative cost effective and environmentally friendly disinfectants to replace conventional chlorination in order to minimize the formation of dbps in this context the interest of employing paa disinfection in water treatment emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s baldry 1983 meyer 1976 the main motivations of employing paa as an alternative to chlorine include 1 very limited or no formation of toxic dbps hassaballah et al 2020 xue et al 2017 2 a wide spectrum of microbial activity similar to chlorine garg et al 2016 and 3 economic feasibility mcfadden et al 2017 paa disinfection was first introduced to treat wastewater effluents in europe and later it gradually became adopted in north america in 1985 the united states environmental protection agency usepa first registered paa as an antimicrobial agent for indoor use on hard surfaces in hospitals later usepa approved the application of paa for combined sewer overflow disinfection in 1999 and for wastewater disinfection in 2012 since then paa disinfection in water treatment has been studied extensively e g the treatment of municipal wastewater manoli et al 2019 industrial effluents kitis 2004 sludge fraser et al 1985 potable water xue et al 2017 and ballast water shah et al 2015 caretti and lubello 2003 conducted a five month long pilot plant study using 1 paa alone 2 uv light irradiation alone 3 addition of paa upstream of the uv device paa uv and 4 addition of paa downstream of the uv device uv paa they found that paa uv process denoted as uv paa process showed the highest efficiency due to the formation of free radicals furthermore the uv paa treatment may considerably reduce the disinfectant dosage contact time and operational cost beber de souza et al 2015 lubello et al 2002 therefore in the last decade the possible use of uv paa for water disinfection has received renewed attention the formation of reactive radical species during uv paa suggests that it may potentially be a new water decontamination technology for removing aqueous organic pollutants 3 chemical and physical properties of paa paa ch3c o ooh belongs to the class of organic peroxides and its molecular structure is shown in fig 2 the properties of paa are listed in table 1 paa is strong oxidizing agent with a high standard reduction potential e 0 1 96 v which is close to h2o2 and higher than chlorine or chlorine dioxide table 2 paa is a man made chemical which is synthesized by reacting acetic acid with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in the presence of a catalyst such as sulfuric acid fiege et al 2012 zhao et al 2007 1 c h 3 c o oh h 2 o 2 h 2 s o 4 c h 3 c o ooh h 2 o the concentration of paa in commercial equilibrium solutions is typically 5 15 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 paa solutions exceeding 15 begin to exhibit some degree of explosiveness instability and reactivity kitis 2004 a stabilizer or a sequestering compound such as alkali metal polyphosphates dipicolinic acid or quinoline derivatives is often used in the production of commercial paa solutions fraise et al 2013 the equilibrium state of paa is a mixture containing paa acetic acid h2o2 and water the molar ratio of paa to h2o2 in commercial paa formulations available in the market is typically 0 1 3 0 zhang and huang 2020a note that the h2o2 present in equilibrium paa is also a disinfectant although h2o2 can also contribute to the inactivation capability of the mixture and the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh flores et al 2015 paa is a stronger disinfectant for a wide spectrum of micro organisms while h2o2 requires much larger dosages to reach the same level of inactivation flores et al 2014 wagner et al 2002 paa is clear colorless liquid with a strong pungent acrid odor and no foaming capability kitis 2004 it is weaker acid than the parent acetic acid and has a pka value of 8 2 zhao et al 2007 2 c h 3 c o ooh h 2 o c h 3 c o o o h 3 o at ambient pressure a 12 paa has the freezing point typically in the range of 40 3 to 42 0 c kitis 2004 it is important to note that paa is highly corrosive as an organic peroxide paa is thermodynamically unstable and can decompose or explode when heated or under impact wang et al 2015 the thermal stability is mainly determined by the dissociation energy of the peroxide o o bond paa has a weaker peroxide bond 159 kj mol than h2o2 213 kj mol bianchini et al 2002 natural decomposition of paa solution may occur at room temperature and produces acetic acid and oxygen eq 3 thermal decomposition of paa is a first order reaction which accelerates with increasing temperature for example the decomposition rate constants of paa in a commercial solution containing 5 paa and 20 h2o2 are 1 71 10 3 h 1 at 25 c and 9 64 10 3 h 1 at 45 c kunigk et al 2001 the recommended storage temperature for paa solutions is below 30 c to avoid decomposition wang et al 2015 the stability of paa solution also depends on the ph and the addition of bases would lead to decomposition with loss of active oxygen fiege et al 2012 in the ph range between 5 5 and 8 2 paa decomposes spontaneously but hydrolysis appears to be negligible eq 3 whereas above ph 8 2 paa undergoes both spontaneous decomposition and hydrolysis producing acetic acid and h2o2 eq 4 chen and pavlostathis 2019 3 2 c h 3 c o ooh 2 c h 3 c o oh o 2 4 c h 3 c o ooh h 2 o o h c h 3 c o oh h 2 o

rate constants of paa were between 2 08 10 3 and 9 44 10 3 h 1 at ph 3 11 between 2 61 10 3 and 16 69 10 3 h 1 at ph 5 0 and between 7 50 10 3 and 47 63 10 3 h 1 at ph 7 0 kunigk et al 2014 4 paa activation methods in paa based aops the formation of reactive radical species is an important step for water and wastewater disinfection and oxidation of aqueous micropollutants the radical generation can be activated by a variety of methods such as uv solar light irradiation ultrasound exposure or catalysis metal ions activated carbon 4 1 activation by radiation the additional energy provided by uv solar irradiation ultrasound or even gamma radiation can activate the peroxide in aops among these energy sources uv light is the most commonly used activation method 4 1 1 uv light irradiation in recent years uv has attracted wide interest for microbial disinfection and degradation of organic pollutants by direct or indirect photolysis it has been reported that the efficiency of uv light irradiation can be improved by adding oxidants or photosensitizing compounds into the system buthiyappan et al 2015 the most commonly applied uv light wavelength for paa activation is 254 nm which is readily available from low pressure mercury lamps the general appearance of aqueous paa uv absorption spectrum is similar to h2o2 but with a slightly lower overall absorbance cai et al 2017 keller et al 2008 cai et al 2017 determined the quantum yield of paa by introducing an excess amount of tba to inhibit the reaction between paa and oh the obtained quantum yields at 254 nm were 1 20 and 2 09 mol einstein 1 for the neutral paa and anionic paa forms respectively however the removal of paa by other reactive species e g ch3c o o was not accounted for in the study by cai et al 2017 besides after reacting with oh tba may yield the tba radical ch3 3co which can react with paa zhang and huang 2020b in order to obtain accurate quantum yield data zhang and huang 2020b used 2 4 hexadiene as the radical scavenger to inhibit reaction of paa with both oh and ch3c o o during the photolysis the quantum yield for the protonated paa in that study was found to be 0 88 0 04 mol einstein 1 a greater than unity quantum yield would indicate that secondary reactions of the hot fragments from the primary photolysis contribute to this process according to eq 5 irradiation of paa with uv light leads to homolytic o o bond cleavage yielding oh and acetyloxyl radicals ch3c o o this is the first and rate determining step for the formation of reactive radicals during uv paa process caretti and lubello 2003 lubello et al 2002 5 c h 3 c o ooh hv c h 3 c o o oh subsequently both oh and ch3c o o can further react with paa or acetic acid yielding secondary radicals the hydroxyl radical can attack paa via h abstraction resulting in the formation of acetylperoxyl radical ch3c o oo rokhina et al 2010 eq 6 furthermore ch3c o o can also abstract hydrogen atom from paa to form ch3c o oo and acetic acid eq 7 zhang and huang 2020b 6 c h 3 c o ooh oh c h 3 c o oo h 2 o 7 c h 3 c o ooh c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o oo c h 3 c o oh the primary acetyloxyl radical can undergo unimolecular

according to zhang and huang 2020b and a similar decarboxylation rate 1 0 106 s 1 was obtained by kamath et al 2018 the ch3 formed from ch3c o o decarboxylation can rapidly react with oxygen to generate a peroxyl radical ooch3 which can further undergo bimolecular decay zhang and huang 2020b 9 c h 3 o 2 ooc h 3 10 ooc h 3 ooc h 3 hcho c h 3 oh o 2 11 ooc h 3 ooc h 3 2 hcho h 2 o 2 12 ooc h 3

to produce paa therefore partially restarting the oxidation cycle rokhina et al 2010 however zhang and huang 2020b indicated that the reaction between ch3c o o and oh had an insignificant influence to the overall reaction scheme which is expected based on the low steady state concentrations of the two species the presence of h2o2 and acetic acid in equilibrium paa solution their uv photolysis and the new radicals formed increase the complexity of uv paa mechanism zhang and huang 2020b proposed a reaction scheme for uv paa in the presence of h2o2 and acetate ions fig 3 according to this scheme superoxide radical ho2 superoxide radical anion o2 and ooch2c o o have relatively high steady state concentrations during the process many recent scientific publications have focused on employing uv paa treatment for the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms and degradation of environmental pollutants note that uv light alone can directly degrade some organic contaminants which possess dissociative absorption bands in uv however in most cases it is difficult to achieve direct uv mineralization of organic pollutants or removal of uv resistant organisms such as adenoviruses sun et al 2018 on the other hand paa alone cannot effectively disinfect naturally occurring coliphages zanetti et al 2007 nor can it degrade recalcitrant pollutants due to lack of reactivity hey et al 2012 when paa treatment is combined with uv irradiation the contaminants and the pathogenic microorganisms can be destroyed by various mechanisms direct uv photolysis direct oxidation and the synergistic action of uv together with paa i e formation of reactive radical species buthiyappan et al 2015 several studies have demonstrated that uv paa can enhance the efficiency of disinfection and pollutant degradation by the synergistic effect indicating that uv paa is a promising technology for water treatment hassaballah et al 2020 hollman et al 2020 rizzo et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b zhang et al 2020a 4 1 2 solar light irradiation development of cost effective and environmentally friendly waste water treatment technologies is an on going topic of research recently a growing body of this work is focusing on employing renewable energy sources in aops compared with the traditional uv based aops significantly less data has been published on solar driven aops nevertheless some studies have explored the possibility of applying sunlight paa to remove chemical pollutants and pathogens from water similarly to uv irradiation of paa the formation of reactive radical species by sunlight paa also takes place through homolysis of the o o bond by uv photons rizzo et al 2018 employed sunlight paa to degrade chloramphenicol cap in water and compared the results with traditional uv paa the efficiency of the process was significantly reduced with both simulated and natural solar irradiation sources e g only 14 32 of cap was removed after 120 min by simulated solar paa hence the solar energy sources cannot produce high enough photon flux to generate sufficient concentration of reactive species from paa rizzo et al 2019 investigated the efficiency of sunlight paa process on treating contaminants of emerging concern in both groundwater gw and wastewater ww the results indicated that carbamazepine cbz was refractory to sunlight paa process whereas for sulfamethoxazole smx and diclofenac dcf sunlight paa enhanced the degradation efficiency compared to paa alone in gw matrix in general an aqueous matrix can greatly affect the efficiency of sunlight paa for example only 32 of dcf degradation was achieved with 2 mg l 1 of paa in ww compared to 99 observed in gw after 60 min of treatment in addition sunlight paa has also been applied for water disinfection both formisano et al 2016 and rizzo et al 2019 evaluated this approach for the inactivation of e coli and a good performance was observed for example 3 52 log reduction of e coli was achieved after 120 min of solar irradiation with a paa dose of 8 mg l 1 formisano et al 2016 4 1 3 other irradiation based methods the application of ultrasound us to activate paa has not been extensively studied so far although us technology has been commonly used to produce ros in hydroxyl radical based aops anandan et al 2020 panda et al 2020 xu et al 2020 rokhina et al 2013 applied us to enhance the degradation efficiency of phenol by mno2 paa process and found that us induced oxidation removed 70 of phenol within the first hour whereas only 40 was removed in the absence of us rokhina et al 2013 indicated that the us irradiation can generate a high concentration of active species to accelerate the oxidation process however further study on the activation mechanism of paa by ultrasound is still needed 4 2 metal catalysts metal catalysts have been widely used to activate oxidants to generate reactive radical species anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 several studies have investigated the feasibility of activating paa by transition metals mandelli et al 2007 wang et al 2020a wu et al 2020 generally metal catalysts can be classified as homogeneous catalysts dissolved transition metal ions or heterogeneous catalysts e g metal oxides the classic fenton process involves aqueous h2o2 fe2 system but a similar process has been observed for paa as well in such a scheme paa is activated by a transition metal catalyst such as fe co mn or cu the catalysts can decompose the o o bond and activate paa according to wang et al 2020a 15 m n c h 3 c o ooh m n 1 c h 3 c o o o h 16 m n 1 c h 3 c o ooh m n c h 3 c o oo h where m represents the metal catalyst 4 2 1 cobalt based catalysts previous studies have indicated that cobalt co shows better catalytic performance for paa activation than for example mn fe and cu zhang et al 1998a 1998b the decomposition of paa by co results in the production of ch3c o oo and ch3c o o as the primary reactive radical species note that this does not lead to the formation of oh which is an important difference in comparison to uv paa activation reactions given in eqs 17 and 18 show the production of the reactive radical species kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020b 17 c o 2 c h 3 c o ooh c o 3 c h 3 c o o o h 18 c o 3 c h 3 c o ooh c o 2 c h 3 c o oo h this shows that co2 and co3 are continuously recycled during the consumption of paa kim et al 2020 reported the rate constants for paa reacting with co2 and co3 over the initial ph 3 0 8 2 as follows 1 70 101 to 6 67 102 m 1 s 1 co2 and 3 91 10 to 4 57 102 m 1 s 1 co3 subsequently radical reactions shown in eqs 7 14 may generate secondary radicals such as ch3 ooch3 and ho2 wang et al 2020b proposed a reaction scheme involving the reactive species for co paa process targeting smx pollutant fig 4 recent research has focused on the efficiency of co paa process for the treatment of organic pollutants in water tian et al 2018 indicated that co ii paa system could effectively remove organic dyes showing better performance than the classic fenton process and yielding comparable efficiency to that of co ii peroxymonosulfate system in the study by wang et al 2020b the co paa process was used to degrade smx in water and it was observed that 89 4 of smx was removed after 15 min of treatment in addition wang et al 2020b also found that furosemide trichorophenol and naproxen nap all with relatively high initial concentrations 40 μm could be effectively removed by co paa kim et al 2020 evaluated the degradation of cbz smx nap and bisphenol a bpa by co paa and observed good degradation efficiencies over the initial ph range of 3 0 8 1 47 5 100 55 0 100 0 24 4 98 5 and 33 0 87 7 removal of bpa nap smx and cbz respectively cobalt oxides such as c o o co2o3 and co3o4 have also been considered as heterogeneous catalysts for activating various oxidants in order to degrade pollutants han et al 2012 hu and long 2016 among them co3o4 particles have shown good catalytic performance because of the presence of both co ii and co iii in the structure the paa activation mechanism by co3o4 has been put forward by reported similar results when they were applied wu et al 2020 in which the recycling of co2 and co3 was involved and ch3c o o and ch3c o oo were the primary reactive species formed 4 2 2 iron based catalysts iron based catalysts are extensively used in water treatment due to their low cost high efficiency and the environmental friendliness ferrous ion fe2 is the most used fe based catalyst and hence the ros formation mechanism has been widely investigated it is worth mentioning that oxo iron e g feivo2 complexes can form during a fenton process which is a weaker and more selective oxidant that has a longer lifetime he et al 2016 the proposed mechanism for paa decomposition by fe2 is shown below kim et al 2019 19 f e 2 c h 3 c o ooh f e 3 c h 3 c o o o h 20 f e 2 c h 3 c o ooh f e 3 c h 3 co o oh 21 f e 2 c h 3 c o ooh f e iv o 2 c h 3 c o oh note that fe2 can also react

2 f e 2 ho 2 h the rate constant for the last reaction eq 24 is relatively small 0 001 0 01 m 1s 1 kim et al 2019 similarly the reaction rate of fe3 with paa was found to be much slower than fe2 kim et al 2019 moreover the primary reactive radicals and oxidants such as ch3c o o oh and feivo2 can in turn react with paa and h2o2 to form the secondary radicals such as ch3c o oo ch3co and ho2 cai et al 2017 kim et al 2019 rokhina et al 2013 wang et al 2020b kim et al 2019 have applied fe ii paa process to successfully degrade micropollutants such as methylene blue nap and bpa it was shown that this process can remove such pollutants with 48 to 98 efficiency in the ph range of 3 0 8 2 wang et al 2020a have developed a novel heterogeneous fe2 modified zeolite paa aop to degrade aqueous smx with the complete removal of smx achieved within 50 min at neutral ph virkutyte and varma 2014 studied eco friendly magnetic iron oxide pillared montmorillonite fe2o3 montmorillonite to activate paa for degrading dichlorophenol dcp and the results demonstrated that 70 of dcp could be removed after 3 5 h of treatment 4 2 3 mn based catalysts according to previous research the decomposition of paa by mn2 proceeds via non radical route via complicated redox reaction steps i e several mn oxidation states present popov et al 2005 studied the decomposition mechanism of paa by free mn2 ions and mn2 diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid complexes where the formation of radical intermediates was not observed the following non radical reaction scheme was proposed popov et al 2005 rothbart et al 2012

reaction mn2 is rapidly consumed and mn3 forms accordingly rothbart et al 2012 reported similar results when they applied mn2 paa process to degrade dye chemicals in water rokhina et al 2010 investigated degradation of phenol by paa in the presence of mno2 and suggested that homolysis of the peroxide bond in paa over mno2 can generate primary reactive species such as oh and ch3c o o later rokhina et al 2013 developed an ultrasound assisted mno2 paa process for the degradation of phenol and proposed that both radical and non radical schemes could be involved 4 2 4 other metal catalysts luna pabello et al 2009 evaluated the disinfection efficiency of ag paa and ag cu2 paa systems in raw wastewater samples their results showed that category a wastewater could be produced from raw wastewater by treating it with 1 2 12 0 90 mg l 1 of ag cu paa for 60 min similarly de velásquez yáñez noguez jiménez cisneros and luna pabello 2008 observed the enhancement of paa disinfection capability by augmenting the treatment with cu2 and ag ions when removing v cholerae salmonella sp shigella p aeruginosa helminth egg and fecal coliforms the increase in the disinfection efficiency may be due to 1 increased production of reactive radicals and or 2 oxidation of cu2 and ag to more toxic forms for microbiological organisms e g ag2o ag2o2 or cu2o luukkonen et al 2015 investigated the oxidation of bisphenol a bpa by paa in the presence of cu2 or fe2 catalysts it was demonstrated that bpa 60 mg l 1 could be completely removed after 10 min of treatment with 40 mg l 1 paa and 0 02 mg l 1 cu2 or fe2 at ph 3 5 4 3 carbon based catalysts nonmetallic carbonaceous catalysts are gaining growing attention in aop applications due to their relatively large specific surface area excellent chemical and thermal stability and the absence of secondary pollution no metal leaching problem hu et al 2019 pang et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 carbon based materials such as activated carbon ac graphene oxide go and carbon nanotubes cnts have been extensively studied for activating peroxides in water treatment processes up to date only one study has been published on using carbon catalyst to decompose paa zhou et al 2015 used activated carbon fibers acfs as the catalyst to activate paa for degrading dyes the acfs paa process could effectively remove reactive brilliant red x 3b dye over a wide ph range of 3 11 acfs can donate their non bonding electrons to paa which results in homolytic cleavage of the peroxide bond producing oh and ch3c o o 5 paa based aops for water decontamination various aquatic environments including surface water groundwater and wastewaters often contain refractory organic pollutants such as pesticides pharmaceuticals endocrine disruptors dyes and aromatic compounds gogoi et al 2018 tran et al 2018 wilkinson et al 2017 paa based aops may be considered as feasible treatments for waters contaminated with these hazardous and poorly biodegradable pollutants hence there is a growing number of new reports focusing on the application of paa based aops for decontaminating such waters 5 1 degradation of contaminants by direct paa oxidation previous research has indicated that paa alone fails to degrade many organic pollutants e g ibuprofen ibu nap dcf gemfibrozil and clofibric acid in wastewater at low dosages hey et al 2012 on the other hand this also means that paa appears to be more stable in the presence of nom than for example hydrogen peroxide it has also been reported that paa can react directly with some contaminants zhang et al 2017 peroxy organic acids including paa are relatively selective oxidizing agents that prefer attacking molecules containing electron rich moieties such as aromatic rings double and triple bonds levitt et al 2003 paa is likely to oxidize nucleophilic amino acids du et al 2018 as well as other nucleophiles such as β lactam antibiotics zhang et al 2017 in the latter case the reaction rate constant was observed to correlate with the global nucleophilicity of β lactams chipiso et al 2016 have studied the mechanism and kinetics of ethionamide eta oxidation by paa and found that the first step in the reaction is electrophilic attack by paa on the carbon sulfur double bond in eta adding an oxygen atom to the sulfur atom via epoxidation recently due to the growing application of paa in disinfection the oxidizing potential of paa towards various contaminants in water have been studied table 3 lists selected studies employing paa to directly oxidize pollutants in water for more details on the direct oxidation of compounds by paa kim and huang 2020 recently provided a review on the reactivity of paa with respect to various compounds including alkenes aldehydes simple aromatic compounds compounds containing sulfur or nitrogen moieties lignin and lignin model compounds and micropollutants and discussed related mechanisms the rate constants of paa oxidation of organic compounds vary widely by nearly 10 orders of magnitude from 3 2 10 6 to 1 0 105 m 1 s 1 demonstrating its selectivity 5 2 efficiency of water decontamination by paa based aops the removal of refractory organic contaminants from water and wastewater by using aops has been a subject of significant research during the last two decades moreover studies on ozonation fenton uv h2o2 and uv persulfate processes have even been conducted in full scale practical applications in many parts of the world arzate et al 2019 launer et al 2013 rodríguez chueca et al 2018 2019 although the interest in paa based aops for water decontamination is growing rapidly studies on paa based aops have only been conducted in laboratory and batch experiments the current research has mainly focused on emerging paa activation schemes and their feasibility for degrading model compounds these studies have also provided important new mechanistic and kinetic information the general goal of these studies is to develop convenient and economically feasible processes for removing water contaminants by paa before any practical application of paa based aops there is a need to determine the important design and operational variables such as the optimum paa dosage and the effect of various water matrices table 4 shows a summary of studies using paa based aops to eliminate organic pollutants from wastewater the general observation is that paa based aops exhibit good performance for removing a wide variety of organic pollutants including dyes phenols and pharmaceuticals as mentioned earlier the removal of some organic pollutants from aqueous solutions is in principle possible directly by paa alone but relatively large doses of paa would be required however paa based aops most often achieve better degradation efficiency for the target compounds for example hollman et al 2020 reported that 20 mg l 1 of paa alone can only remove 9 of smx after 5 h with no degradation observed for ven flu or cbz while uv c 254 nm paa showed complete degradation of all the tested pharmaceuticals 5 3 oxidation mechanisms of paa based aops for water decontamination 5 3 1 identification of main reactive species in paa based aops it is generally recognized that all the generated radical species can contribute to the degradation of organic pollutants however in order to provide insight into the degradation mechanisms of organic pollutants in paa based aops it is necessary to identify the main reactive species responsible for the degradation process according to previous studies cai et al 2017 kim et al 2020 zhang and huang 2020b it has been suggested that oh and other oxygen centered radicals such as ch3c o o and ch3c o oo play relatively important roles ch3 is considered less important due to its weaker oxidizing capacity relative to oh and its high reactivity with dissolved oxygen eq 9 on the other hand organic radicals generally have longer half lives than oh clapp et al 1994 and may therefore be more selective in attacking organic compounds in order to better understand the role of oh and the other radicals in the degradation process radical scavenging experiments combined with electron paramagnetic resonance epr or electron spin resonance esr measurements are often carried out to identify the free radical intermediates epr spectroscopy is one of the very few methods that can directly detect free radicals via a spin trap compound typically a nitrone or nitroso compound davies 2016 the spin trapping agents such as 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo can react with free radicals to form a relatively stable spin adduct which can be subsequently identified and quantified by epr while this can identify the radical species it cannot provide the information on their origin or subsequent oxidation reactions furthermore there are possible direct non radical reactions involving spin trap compounds that can produce either false negative or false positive results therefore complementary radical scavenging experiments should additionally be carried out to verify the observations and to determine the reaction rates using the technique of competition kinetics radical scavenging can be categorized as chemical probe method which relies on the difference between the reaction rates of the reference quenching agent and target compound with reactive radicals in radical scavenging experiments tert butyl alcohol tba is the most commonly used reference quenching agent while studying paa based system but methanol meoh or ethanol etoh 4 chlorobenzoicacid p cba and ascorbic acid aa have also been used tba is a well known oh scavenger k oh tba 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 but it does not react with organic radicals yang et al 2019 table 5 summarizes selected studies on paa based aops which have investigated the contribution of reactive radicals based on quenching experiments and or epr spectroscopy in uv paa process it has been suggested that primary radicals oh and ch3c o o play a main role in degrading most organic pollutants by using the tba assay cai et al 2017 found that oh was the dominant radical species responsible for the degradation of cbz and ibu during uv paa whereas ch3c o o and or ch3c o oo contributed more to the degradation of naphthyl compounds such as nap and 2 naphthoxyacetic acid similar results were also reported by chen et al 2019 where tba and p cba were used as oh quenching compounds in a uv paa system recently zhang and huang 2020b established a first comprehensive model for the reaction kinetics for uv paa that could account for the influence of uv paa h2o2 and acetate ions in the system and evaluated the reaction mechanism for producing the reactive species using kinetic modeling and the radical quenching technique employing tba for oh and 2 4 hexadiene for oh and ch3c o o the authors showed that ch3c o oo is the most abundant organic radical under uv paa oh and ch3c o oo appear to be the most important radicals for compound degradation and their production is significantly influenced by the paa h2o2 acetate composition and the uv fluence when transition metals are introduced into a paa solution the primary radicals ch3c o o and ch3c o oo were proposed to be the dominant species formed during the initial phase of the reaction wang et al 2020b used dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol tmp spin trapping agents to identify the radical species generated during co paa process the results from epr spectroscopy indicated that both ch3c o o and ch3c o oo contribute to the degradation of smx by co paa moreover through further analysis of the results from tba assay ch3c o oo was proposed to play the main role for smx degradation with ch3c o o contributing less ch3c o oo is considered as the most powerful oxidizing peroxyl radical and hence its rate constant reacting with most compounds is in the diffusion limited regime 108 109 m 1 s 1 mortensen 2001 neta et al 1990 kim et al 2020 further studied the reaction kinetics of co paa and established the dominant role of ch3c o oo in this aop using the co paa system the reactivity of 30 different aromatic compounds with ch3c o oo was assessed using a structure activity relationship the results show that the compound degradation is due to electron transfer mechanism involving ch3c o oo kim et al 2019 have used 5 diisopropoxyphosphoryl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dippmpo as a spin trap to study fe ii paa system fitting based simulations of the epr spectra revealed the presence of oh ch3co ch3c o o and ch3 radicals in the system scavenging experiments using tba indicated that organic radicals and or fe iv were the main reactive species responsible for the initial rapid degradation of methylene blue nap and bpa while oh played an important role in the secondary reactions zhou et al 2015 studied paa activated carbon fiber system by epr using 4 hydroxy 5 5 dimethyl 2 trifluorome thylpyrroline 1 oxide fdmpo as the spin trapping reagent they observed both hydroxyl and carbon centered radical adducts during this reaction which were identified based on their isotropic hyperfine coupling constants however scavenging experiments using tba revealed that oh played only a minor role in the removal of red dye in this system 5 3 2 reactions of organic compounds in paa based aops reaction mechanisms for aqueous solutions containing free radicals and organic compounds can involve various radical intermediates and include complex secondary reactions however in most cases the reactions responsible for the initial phase of the mechanism are fairly well understood as mentioned earlier oh plays an important role in many paa based oxidation systems the hydroxyl radical is an electrophilic agent with well documented chemistry it can react with organic compounds through hydrogen atom abstraction add to unsaturated bonds double bonds and aromatic rings and participate in electron transfer reactions cooper et al 2009 liu et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 peroxyl radicals ch3c o o and ch3c o oo which play important roles in paa based aops can react with organic compounds in a similar way as oh neta et al 1990 however due to the difference in their redox capability peroxyl radicals and oh tend to show quite different reactivity towards organic pollutants while oh is non selective and extremely reactive towards nearly all organic compounds the reactivity of ch3c o o and ch3c o oo is more selective towards electron rich sites gonzalez cuervo kozlov süss fink and shul pin 2004 for uv paa cai et al 2017 indicated that ch3c o o and or ch3c o oo contributed significantly to the rapid degradation of nap but not cbz or ibu the naphthalene ring in naproxen molecule could be easily attacked by the peroxyl radicals peroxyl radicals were also suggested as the main reactive species for degrading smx in co paa which preferentially attack the nh2 group of smx through hydrogen atom abstraction step et al 1994 wang et al 2020b in general ch3c o oo and ch3c o o can attack alkanes by hydrogen atom abstraction for example in the latter case it has been observed that ch3c o o can oxidize phenol by this mechanism which led to the formation of ring cleavage products rokhina et al 2010 however most studies conclude that the reactions involving peroxyl radicals proceed via electron transfer ch3c o oo has been reported to react rapidly with 2 2 4 trimethyl 1 3 pentanediol tmpd 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid abts and ascorbate by this mechanism schuchmann and von sonntag 1988 kim et al 2019 also proposed that the degradation of methylene blue nap and bpa by fe ii paa was initiated by electron transfer from the target compound to ch3c o o and or ch3c o oo by assessing the structure activity relationship between 30 different aromatic compounds molecular descriptors and their pseudo first order degradation rate constants in co paa process kim et al 2020 concluded that electron transfer is the main reaction between ch3c o oo and aromatic compounds however direct experimental evidence for electron transfer to ch3c o o ch3c o oo is relatively limited therefore more investigations are needed to confirm this theory 5 4 influence of water matrix and operational parameters the performance of aops for removing organic compounds can be affected by the water matrix and various experimental parameters such as ph catalyst dosage the oxidizing agent used and the presence of anions and nom it is generally recognized that increasing the catalyst and oxidant dosages can enhance the degradation efficiency but excessive concentrations may lead to radical scavenging and result in decrease in the performance olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 yang et al 2019 in general the ph and the presence of nom and anionic species often influence aops in a complex manner in order to optimize paa based aops all of these parameters must be considered in detail 5 4 1 paa dosage in paa based aops the reactive radical species are mainly formed due to the activation of paa thus the paa dosage is a crucial factor influencing the efficiency of paa based aops in general an increase in paa dosage leads to better degradation performance for example as the paa dosage was increased from 5 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 the degradation rate of venlafaxine ven cbz fluoxetine flu and smx was observed to increase linearly hollman et al 2020 similarly kim et al 2020 evaluated the effect of paa dosage on cbz degradation during 30 min treatment with co ii paa where the degradation efficiency increased from 24 3 to 91 9 when the paa concentration was increased from 20 to 200 μm the enhancement of the degradation efficiency is likely due to the increase in radical generation the formation of reactive radicals in uv paa process has been quantitatively studied by zhang and huang 2020b where the steady state concentrations of ch3c o o and ch3c o oo were significantly increased when the paa dosage grew from 40 to 500 μm the study by wang et al 2020a showed that increasing the paa dosage from 50 to 400 μm improved smx removal efficiency significantly in fe2 zeolite paa aop however when the paa dosage was increased to more than 400 μm no improvement in smx degradation was observed which likely resulted from the radical scavenging effect of the excess amount of paa moreover in uv paa aop the excess paa will absorb the uv light which could reduce the direct photolysis of the target compounds zhang et al 2020a 5 4 2 presence of h2o2 and acetate ions since commercial paa solutions always contain h2o2 the possible contribution of h2o2 during paa based treatments cannot be ignored kim et al 2019 have evaluated the effect of h2o2 on degradation of methylene blue in a fe ii paa system and the results indicate that increasing the relative h2o2 concentration enhances the overall methylene blue removal efficiency from 87 2 to 100 however in fe2 zeolite paa wang et al 2020a and co paa systems wang et al 2020b the co existing h2o2 was found to play a negligible role in the study by kim et al 2020 additional h2o2 was dosed into the co paa system to investigate the influence of h2o2 on cbz degradation it was observed that increasing h2o2 concentration from 31 to 200 μm reduced the removal efficiency from 81 2 to 39 6 in a study by wang et al 2020b the presence of h2o2 did not influence the decay of paa in a co paa system which suggested that there is no decomposition mechanism that would involve both paa and h2o2 simultaneously both wang et al 2020b and kim et al 2020 indicated that the inhibitory effect of additional h2o2 on cbz degradation was likely due to the scavenging of acetyl per oxyl radicals by h2o2 eq 29 eq 30 moreover o2 produced from the deprotonation of ho2 can also rapidly react with ch3c o oo eq 31 von sonntag and schuchmann 1991 29 h 2 o 2 c h 3 c o oo ho 2 c h 3 c o ooh 30 h 2 o 2 c h 3 c o o ho 2 c h 3 c o oh 31 o 2 c h 3 c o oo o 2 c h 3 c o o o both ho2 and o2 have a weaker oxidizing capacity and therefore the compound degradation was inhibited at high concentrations of h2o2 however the scavenging of ch3c o oo by h2o2 becomes less significant when paa is in excess of h2o2 which is supported by the quantitative analysis of zhang and huang 2020b furthermore the study by zhang and huang 2020b showed that increasing the h2o2 concentration in uv paa produces higher amounts of oh when the h2o2 0 paa 0 ratio exceeded 5 it is worth noting that when treating saline water with paa based processes the presence of h2o2 can eliminate the formation of hypohalous acids e g hocl hobr or hoi which minimizes the formation of brominated or chlorinated by products shah et al 2015 in addition to h2o2 a high concentration of acetic acid is also present in equilibrium paa therefore it is necessary to evaluate the role of acetate anion in paa based aops acetate anion can become a radical scavenger especially for oh oh can react with the acetate anion by h abstraction yielding carbon centered radical ch2c o o eq 32 which can further react with dissolved oxygen to form ooch2c o o eq 33 fig 3 buxton et al 1988 schuchmann et al 1985 32 c h 3 co o oh c h 2 co o h 2 o 33 c h 2 co o o 2 ooc h 2 co o the influence of acetic acid in present paa based treatments has not been studied systematically so far based on the study by zhang and huang 2020b the presence of acetate anions reduces the oh concentration 5 4 3 catalyst dosage instead of increasing the oxidizer concentration the degradation efficiency can also be enhanced by including a catalyst in the aop wang et al 2020b found that the decomposition of paa increased significantly when the co catalyst dose in a co paa system was increased thus provided that non radical pathways are suppressed this catalyst increases the radical production and consequently the target pollutant degradation efficiency in heterogeneous catalysis increasing the dosage means that there are more active catalytic sites available gao et al 2017 yang et al 2019 for instance wu et al 2020 reported that the degradation efficiency of orange g og in co3o4 paa system improved from zero to 79 when increasing the catalyst loading from 0 to 0 01 g l 1 a similar improvement was also observed in degradation of smx by fe2 zeolite paa aop wang et al 2020a where the smx removal rate constants increased from 0 013 to 0 13 min 1 with the dosage of fe2 zeolite increasing from 0 2 to 0 8 g l 1 however when the catalyst dosage was increased to 1 0 g l 1 the rate constant decreased to 0 077 min 1 due to aggregation and sedimentation of the catalyst a too high catalyst concentration may lead to radical scavenging by the catalyst which reduces the efficiency of the treatment for example kim et al 2019 investigated the effect of fe ii dosage 20 500 μm in fe ii paa degradation of methylene blue the results showed that the removal rate of methylene blue 63 1 75 did not change significantly at doses between 20 100 μm whereas the rate decreased to 46 0 at 500 μm this was proposed to be due to the consumption of the reactive radicals by the excess amount of fe ii catalyst kim et al 2020 reported that cbz removal efficiency improved from 30 5 to 97 7 after 30 min when increasing the co ii concentration from 1 to 100 μm it was found that pseudo first order rate constant for degradation of cbz by co paa grew linearly when co ii dosage was increased from 1 to 20 μm this indicates that radical i e ch3c o oo scavenging by cobalt ions is not significant when paa co however the growth became non linear when the co ii concentration was more than 20 μm and the inhibitory effect of co ii on cbz degradation was observed when paa co in the latter case the reduced efficiency is likely due to high radical scavenging efficiency of the excess cobalt ions 5 4 4 influence of ph in paa based aops the solution ph is a crucial parameter which significantly affects the chemistry of the radicals catalysts oxidants as well as the target compounds firstly the ph influences the paa acid base equilibrium and hence the generation of the reactive radical species since the pka value of paa is 8 2 the protonated form paa0 is more dominant below ph 8 2 and the deprotonated form paa above this ph paa has a higher molar absorption coefficient than paa0 at 254 nm which leads to faster photolysis of paa compared to paa0 cai et al 2017 zhang and huang 2020b based on this observation more reactive radicals should be generated during alkaline uv paa process for example mukhopadhyay and daswat 2014 reported that the optimal ph for 4 chlorophenol degradation by uv paa aop is 9 5 when the effect of ph was studied systematically in the range 4 9 5 however employing highly alkaline conditions e g ph 11 may exhibit adverse effects on uv paa performance due to the decreased redox potential of the reactive radicals e g oh and the competition between oh and the target compounds for oh zhang et al 2020a as for metal catalytic processes the ph can affect the formation of transition metal species that can react with the oxidant in a fe2 zeolite paa system fe2 in the zeolite structure may exchange h under acidic conditions or transform to hydroxide under alkaline conditions thus neutral solution was considered to best for fe2 activity wang et al 2020a kim et al 2020 reported that the optimal ph range for compound degradation by co paa was 5 0 ph 7 1 while more acidic or basic conditions inhibited the degradation the ph of the solution influences the speciation of co ii co iii ions paa and the target compounds the work by kim et al 2020 suggested that protonation deprotonation of paa should be the main ph related factor influencing the decomposition rate in co paa system in addition during heterogeneous activation of paa ph can also affect the surface charges of the metal oxide for example neutral ph was found to be optimal for co3o4 paa aop due to the favorable electrostatic interaction between paa0 and the catalyst surface wu et al 2020 under acidic conditions a hydrogen bond forms between the excess h and the o o fragment of paa which hinders paa s interaction with the positively charged co3o4 catalyst surface on the other hand under alkaline conditions electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged oxide surface and paa would similarly reduce the interaction with the catalyst finally the solution ph can also affect the pollutant chemicals and change their reactivity towards oxidants for example smx mainly exists in its deprotonated form at ph greater than 5 6 smx pka1 is 1 8 and pka2 5 6 which is more reactive toward the radicals formed in aops ao and liu 2017 5 4 5 presence of anions several anions naturally found in water can affect the ability of activated paa to degrade aqueous contaminants chloride ion cl is one of the main inorganic anions that is present in almost all natural waters paa can react directly with chloride to form secondary oxidant hocl shah et al 2015 when chloride is present during aop it has been suggested to react with oh to produce various reactive chlorine containing species including cl cloh and cl2 similarly for peroxyl radicals cl can also act as a scavenger yielding chlorine containing species chen et al 2019 shah et al 2015 zhang et al 2020a 34 c l c h 3 c o ooh hocl c h 3 co o 35 c l oh hoc l 36 c l c h 3 c o oo h cl c h 3 c o ooh 37 cl h 2 o hoc l h 38 cl c l cl 2 in general chlorine containing species tend to have weaker oxidizing capacity than oh but they can also show higher selectivity towards certain compounds thus the impact of cl on the degradation process depends on the target compound chen et al 2019 found that cl 0 200 mm had negligible effect on the degradation of naproxen in uv paa process the work by kim et al 2020 shows that the presence of cl 100 1000 μm had little impact on cbz degradation by co paa similar results were also reported by wu et al 2020 and zhang et al 2020a for smx a significant negative impact on the degradation efficiency was observed in fe2 zeolite paa aop wang et al 2020a carbonate co3 2 and bicarbonate hco3 ions mainly contribute to the alkalinity of water both ions are well known radical scavengers co3 2 and hco3 can quench oh and so4 to generate less reactive co3 and hco3 izadifard et al 2017 co3 2 0 500 μm showed a notable negative effect on smx removal efficiency in fe2 zeolite paa aop because oh is the main reactive radical species responsible for degrading smx however for systems in which peroxyl radicals play the main role the inhibition effect of co3 2 hco3 may not be so pronounced previous studies cai et al 2017 chen et al 2019 have indicated that co3 2 hco3 could not scavenge peroxyl radicals including ch3c o oo suggesting that the reaction rate constant between co3 2 hco3 and those radicals is small for instance co3 2 hco3 0 20 mm had a minimal effect on nap degradation during uv paa process chen et al 2019 on the other hand the inhibiting effect of hco3 was still observed in co paa kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020b and co3o4 paa systems wu et al 2020 where peroxyl radicals play an important role this has been attributed to the formation of nonreactive co2 hco3 complexes xu et al 2011 nitrate ion no3 is a well known photosensitizer which often influences the efficiency of photochemical processes park et al 2010 on one hand no3 can absorb uv photons to reduce the direct photolysis of compounds and on the other hand no3 can undergo uv photolysis leading to secondary reactions to produce oh that can further degrade the target compounds 39 no 3 h 2 o h v no 2 oh oh zhang et al 2020a reported enhanced removal efficiency for diclofenac by uv paa in the presence of no3 which demonstrates that the overall positive effect of including no3 can outweigh the negatives 5 4 6 contribution of nom nom is a ubiquitous complex constituent in natural waters which typically consists of humic substances hs including humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa nom may enhance or inhibit the degradation of target organic contaminants on one hand as a photosensitizer nom is able to photogenerate oh to enhance the degradation process but nom can also act as a radical scavenger wu et al 2020 observed a clear inhibitory effect of ha 0 20 mg l 1 on the degradation efficiency of og by co3o4 paa in the study by kim et al 2020 the addition of ha 1 10 mg l 1 reduced the cbz degradation efficiency by 69 4 during 30 min of co paa process this phenomenon was also reported by zhang et al 2020a where the removal of diclofenac was reduced in the presence of nom during uv paa treatment ha can scavenge peroxyl radicals with a reaction rate constant of 104 l mg 1 s 1 which is comparable to oh chen et al 2019 comparative studies between paa based and other commonly used aops for pollutant degradation will help to better understand the relative performance the aops for water decontamination applications zhang et al 2020a reported that the degradation rate constants of diclofenac followed the order k uv paa 0 1161 min 1 k uv persulfate 0 1071 min 1 k uv h2o2 0 0857 min 1 hollman et al 2020 concluded that for the same oxidant dosage approximately 50 mg l 1 uv h2o2 was faster than uv paa for removing ven flu or cbz whereas only smx was degraded faster by uv paa luukkonen et al 2015 compared the efficiency of h2o2 and paa for the oxidation of bpa in the presence of fe2 or cu2 and their results indicated that commercial paa was slightly more effective than h2o2 generally the performance of paa based aops for pollutant degradation can be considered comparable to the h2o2 based processes 6 paa based aops for water disinfection disinfection of drinking water and wastewater effluents is essential since they may contain pathogenic bacteria fungi and viruses that can cause immediate adverse health effects on the population using chemicals such as chlorine to remove pathogenic species from water has been widely applied in the water treatment industry gad allah et al 2017 liu et al 2018 otter et al 2020 however the chemical disinfectants can react with organic compounds present in the water and generate toxic dbps furthermore some emerging waterborne pathogens such as cryptosporidium and giardia are resistant to these traditional chemical disinfection approaches you et al 2019 for these reasons the highly reactive radicals produced during aops have attracted increasing attention in disinfection applications xiao et al 2019 in fact using aops for the inactivation of microorganisms is a relatively new area and most of the studies were carried out within the last two decades paa is an emerging chemical disinfectant which has been proven to exhibit excellent antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms the byproducts of paa disinfection are primarily comprised of carboxylic acids which exhibit no toxicity or mutagenicity therefore paa based aops may provide a new strategy for the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms moreover the implementation of paa disinfection allows an easy and relatively inexpensive upgrade of the existing chlorination equipment however paa alone may not be sufficiently effective when higher inactivation rates are required e g in wastewater reuse applications furthermore a high paa dose may increase the effluent organic content resulting in enhanced microbial regrowth previous studies formisano et al 2016 hassaballah et al 2020 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b have demonstrated that the improvement of microorganism inactivation in water during paa based aops is due to the formation of reactive radical species however only a few investigations have focused on testing the effectiveness of paa based aops for water disinfection but the increasing number of reports published on this subject is indicative of its good developmental prospects 6 1 efficiency of microorganism inactivation by paa based aops only a limited number of studies on paa based aops for inactivating pathogenic microorganisms have been reported as summarized in table 6 in order to characterize the disinfection efficiency the disinfection rate is used which is calculated as the logarithm of the ratio between the concentration of microorganisms at a given time and the initial concentration among these studies uv paa is the most commonly used technology for water and wastewater disinfection to reduce the treatment cost due consumption of electricity some researchers have explored the possibility of using sunlight paa for water disinfection formisano et al 2016 demonstrated that sunlight paa can achieve a high inactivation rate 3 52 and 4 50 log reduction for e coli and enterococci respectively after 120 min of solar irradiation with a paa dose of 8 mg l 1 rizzo et al 2019 also evaluated the effect of sunlight paa on the inactivation of antibiotic resistant form of e coli and reported that the inactivation rate of sunlight paa was higher compared to sunlight alone for gw the best performance was achieved after 30 min with 0 2 mg l 1 of paa and cumulative uv light energy supply quv of 4 40 kj l 1 whereas for ww the best performance and lod limit of detection 2 cfu ml 1 was achieved with 10 mg l 1 paa and 2 min irradiation quv 0 28 kj l 1 uv tio2 aop has been more intensively studied as an alternative disinfection technique interestingly paa can also be applied in uv tio2 process to achieve better inactivation performance drosou et al 2010 has investigated the efficiency of uv a tio2 and ultrasound uv a tio2 in the presence of paa for inactivating e coli suspensions paa assisted uv a tio2 photocatalysis could generally achieve total inactivation of e coli after 10 20 min of treatment 0 5 2 mg l 1 of paa 100 500 mg l 1 of tio2 moreover the e coli inactivation efficiency could be further enhanced by ultrasound paa ultrasound uv a tio2 process in addition to uv light activation metal catalysts have also been used in this field e g ag paa and ag cu2 paa de velásquez et al 2008 luna pabello et al 2009 as shown in table 6 various microorganisms including bacteria viruses and protozoa were reportedly inactivated by paa based aops most studies have been conducted using strains of e coli since this bacterium is considered as an indicator of fecal contamination in aquatic environments vinet and zhedanov 2011 and it has well known structure and composition it was shown that paa based aops generally exhibit excellent performance for eliminating e coli paa based aops for eliminating other bacteria which are frequently detected and often used as indicator microorganisms in waste water e g enterococcus sp salmonella sp pseudomonas aeruginosa shigella sp v cholerae have also been studied in the literature it has been observed that the cellular structure of the microorganism can influence the inactivation efficiency for example enterococcus sp is more resistant to paa only disinfection than e coli with 1 2 logs lower efficiency at comparable exposures hassaballah et al 2020 uv paa as a combined treatment appeared to achieve a higher inactivation efficiency than paa alone for e coli 3 1 3 6 logs and enterococcus sp 1 4 logs but there is still an efficiency gap between these two strains of bacteria however de velásquez et al 2008 found that ag paa could achieve good overall inactivation efficiency for various bacteria including v cholerae 4 2 logs salmonella sp 3 2 logs shigella sp 3 9 logs and p aeruginosa 3 7 logs therefore in order to better understand the feasibility of paa based aops as new alternative disinfection technologies the response of various bacteria to paa based aops must be systematically studied it is worth mentioning that antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistant genes args can be found in numerous aquatic environments due to the heavy use of antibiotics nowadays which have become a major threat for human health and a serious challenge for waste water treatment the direct influence of paa based aops on arb and args has not received much attention thus far and only rizzo et al 2019 have reported inactivation of antibiotic resistant form of e coli resistant to smx by uv paa and sunlight paa treatments in both paa and chlorine based disinfection treatments viruses tend to require higher exposures than bacteria in order to reach comparable levels of inactivation hassaballah et al 2020 however some previous studies have indicated that synergistic effects in paa based aops are slightly lower for viruses than for bacteria for example koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 found that combined uv paa disinfection treatment of enteric bacteria achieved significant synergy benefits while the treatment of coliphage ms2 did not show any similarly guerra rodríguez et al 2018 reported only slight synergy in uv paa based reduction of infectivity at paa doses commonly employed at wastewater treatment plants 0 5 2 mg l 1 the observed reduced synergy was likely due to the presence of radical scavengers in the wastewater samples hassaballah et al 2020 reported that uv paa treatment could achieve a maximum log reduction of 2 7 for somatic coliphage and 4 7 log reduction for e coli similar results were also obtained earlier by hassaballah et al 2019 beber de souza et al 2015 reported high inactivation of both e coli and coliphages with 5 log microorganism reduction in uv paa treated water protozoa are even less susceptible to paa and chlorine than viruses and bacteria up to date only hassaballah et al 2020 have investigated inactivation of cryptosporidium parvum by uv paa but their results were inconclusive whether cryptosporidium parvum oocysts were more susceptible to paa uv or both future work is needed to resolve this issue 6 2 inactivation mechanisms by paa alone the mechanism of disinfection by paa alone without activation is still under investigation some researchers have suggested that paa functions in a similar way as the other peroxides and oxidizing agents during disinfection fraise et al 2013 alternative theory is that paa may release reactive oxygen species which act as the disinfectant liberti and notarnicola 1999 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 the protonated form of paa paa0 which exists below ph 8 2 is thought to be the biocidal form whereas the deprotonated form paa is not wagner et al 2002 paa can oxidize sulfhydryl sh and disulphide s s bonds in proteins and enzymes and then the important components in the membranes and inside the cell would become dysfunctional flores et al 2014 mcfadden et al 2017 sánchez ruiz et al 1995 previous research has put forward several specific inactivation mechanisms for paa kitis 2004 paa could disrupt the chemiosmotic function of the lipoprotein cytoplasmic membrane and transport through dislocation or rupture of cell walls leaper 2007 intracellular paa could also play a role in the inactivation of the catalase enzyme which inhibits hydroxyl radical oxidation fraser et al 1985 its action as a protein denaturant may explain its disinfection effectiveness against spores in addition it was suggested that paa can release hydroxyl radicals which oxidize proteins and lipids to compromise bacterial cell walls lipid peroxidation and to denature cellular dna coyle et al 2014 lubello et al 2002 the h2o2 contained in the commercial paa solutions appeared to play a less important role during disinfection processes koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 as an organic peroxide paa may penetrate more efficiently microbial cells than h2o2 molecules leading to the enhancement of its disinfection properties via disruption of cell membranes and blockage of enzymatic and transport systems in microorganisms in addition some microorganisms may be protected against h2o2 due to their catalase enzyme activity while this enzyme does not protect against paa wagner et al 2002 6 3 inactivation mechanisms of paa based aops radical formation by paa can be enhanced by combining the treatment with other methods most studies in this field have utilized uv irradiation for activating paa to eliminate microorganisms caretti and lubello 2003 hassaballah et al 2019 vankerckhoven et al 2011 previous work has demonstrated that addition of paa before uv irradiation uv paa produces better disinfection results than uv alone paa alone or uv applied before paa caretti and lubello 2003 the effect of bacterial inactivation resulting from the uv paa method is greater than the sum of the individual effects confirming the synergy between the two treatments beber de souza et al 2015 uv radiation can cause direct damage to nucleic acids while chemical disinfectants may attack microbial cell walls membranes and enzymatic or transport systems hassaballah et al 2020 different types of injuries induced by uv and paa may limit the microorganisms ability to repair cellular structures in addition the generated radicals by uv paa can also act as disinfectants sun et al 2018 therefore under uv paa multiple mechanisms are present including uv irradiation paa and reactive radicals leading to the possibility that a synergistic effect among all of these mechanisms could potentially be involved in microorganism inactivation zhang et al 2020b zhang et al 2020b have investigated the mechanism of uv paa disinfection for three bacteria e coli e durans and s epidermidis in that study the radicals generated under uv paa played a greater role in inactivating e coli than e durans and s epidermidis the contribution of radicals to the overall inactivation was moderate a larger contribution from the synergistic effect was observed in the inactivation of s epidermidis and e coli and could at least be partially attributed to the diffusion of paa into the cells as mentioned in 4 1 1 the free radicals generated in uv paa process are mainly oh ch3c o o and ch3c o oo with oh being a more efficient disinfectant sun et al 2018 investigated the role of free radicals in inactivation of e coli during uv paa process in the presence of an excess amount of tba the results indicated that oh was the main species responsible for the inactivation while organic radicals played a negligible role in general oh can inactivate microorganisms by destruction of i cell membrane wall ii enzymes and iii genetic materials bai et al 2018 zoschke et al 2014 fig 5 firstly oh can induce oxidation and disruption of the lipids in the cell wall and membrane which perturbs its structure and permeability moreover as an electrophilic agent oh exhibits high reactivity towards many enzymes such as lysozyme and ribonuclease finally genetic materials such as dna and rna present in microorganisms can become mutated when attacked by oh de velásquez et al 2008 and luna pabello et al 2009 have evaluated the efficiency of paa in disinfecting advanced primary treatment apt effluent by combining the oxidant with cu2 and ag in these studies the synergy between paa and ag for removing various microorganism such as v cholerae salmonella sp shigella p aeruginosa helminth eggs and fecal coliforms was observed addition of cu and or ag ions decreased the required contact time for disinfection the proposed mechanism of this synergistic action shows some differences when compared with the uv paa process in addition to generating more free radicals unstable and toxic metal oxides such as ag2o ag2o2 and cu2o were produced during the oxidation of ag and cu which are significantly more effective disinfectants than the cu ag ions themselves davies and etris 1997 6 4 disinfection by uv paa treatment photochemical technologies are simple environmental friendly and cost effective in many water treatment applications with possible dual action for removing environmental contaminants and disinfection in photo driven aops application of uv based treatments is expected to increase since the use of uv in water and wastewater treatment is well known and widely implemented the inactivation of waterborne pathogens by uv mainly uv c light is due to damaging the nucleic acids dna rna in cells and viruses and hence uv disinfection is regarded as being broadly effective against various kinds of microorganisms including pathogens bacteria protozoa and viruses hijnen et al 2006 however there are several uv resistant organisms e g adenoviruses which require higher uv doses to disinfect and therefore increase the cost of the treatment combined disinfection methods consist of using two or more disinfectants simultaneously or sequentially which may provide enhancement of the microbial inactivation efficiency this includes synergistic benefits reduced formation of dbps and smaller doses of disinfecting agents required beber de souza et al 2015 up to date proposed combined waste water disinfection treatments include uv based aops such as uv tio2 cho et al 2002 uv chlorine mounaouer and abdennaceur 2016 and uv h2o2 sun et al 2016 recently uv paa has attracted growing interest for inactivating microorganisms in addition to experiments carried out on laboratory scale some pilot scale studies employing uv paa have been reported in recent years caretti and lubello 2003 conducted a pilot plant experiment using uv paa for disinfecting wwtp secondary effluent with a high concentration of total coliforms about 6 logs mpn 100 ml 1 total inactivation of the tested microorganisms e g coliforms e coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa was reached with 2 mg l 1 of paa and 165 mj cm 2 of uv 254 nm vankerckhoven et al 2011 examined uv paa disinfection of municipal water in a pilot scale system using a mixed bacterial suspension a combination of 2 3 mg l 1 paa and uv uv dose 234 mj cm 2 resulted in 4 0 log cfu ml 1 after 72 h of treatment similar results were also reported by hassaballah et al 2019 where it was observed that uv paa treatment paa 45 135 mg min l 1 uv dose 30 mj cm 2 exhibited better inactivation efficiency than paa alone for somatic coliphage in secondary effluent and for fecal coliforms e coli and somatic coliphage in tertiary effluent the synergy in uv paa treatment involves multiple degradation mechanisms as discussed in section 6 2 uv paa is the most intensively studied paa based aop which is expected to find practical full scale use in the near future a summary of laboratory and pilot scale studies of uv paa disinfection is provided in table 6 moreover other aspects of uv paa disinfection such as inactivation kinetics influence of the process operational parameters and presence of water matrices as well as comparisons with other disinfection methods are described in the following sections 6 4 1 inactivation kinetics and synergistic effects analysis of the inactivation kinetics helps to better understand the disinfection process and evaluate its performance the precursor concentration c mol l 1 and exposure time t min are the main factors for determining the required disinfectant dosage the most widely used model for estimating bacterial inactivation is the chick s law which is based on a log linear relationship 40 log n n 0 k t where n n0 is the bacterial or spore concentration reduction ratio k is the inactivation rate constant which is model dependent and t is the contact time min this model reduces the disinfection process to a bimolecular chemical reaction in which microorganisms are treated as molecular species romero martínez et al 2019 ferreira et al 2020 have shown that the disinfection kinetics in photochemical disinfection processes generally follow the chick s law macintyre et al 2018 however as an emerging disinfection technology existing studies on modeling the inactivation under uv paa process are fairly limited formisano et al 2016 found that chick s pseudo first order rate law was suitable for describing uv paa inactivation of e coli and enterococci with statistical r2 very close to 1 however azzellino et al 2011 showed that inactivation of total and fecal coliforms as well as e coli by paa treatment in secondary effluent could be described by two non linear models hom s model and s model sun et al 2018 analyzed e coli inactivation kinetics of uv paa and uv paa by using the hom s model eq 41 which is an empirical generalization of chick s pseudo first order rate law gyürék and finch 1998 41 log n n 0 k c t 3 where k is the disinfection rate constant c is the disinfectant concentration and t is the treatment time in order to determine and quantify the synergistic effects in uv paa treatment eq 42 has been applied koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 the synergy is present when the inactivation efficiency from the sequential combined action is higher than the sum of the individual inactivation treatments 42 synergy lo g uv paa lo g paa lo g uv where loguv paa is the reduction of infectivity by uv paa logpaa is the reduction of infectivity by paa only and loguv is the reduction of infectivity by uv irradiation only 6 4 2 effect of operational parameters generally operational parameters like uv and paa doses influence the inactivation efficiency of uv paa based processes formisano et al 2016 investigated the effect of paa dose on the inactivation of bacteria during uv paa treatment at varying concentrations 4 8 12 mg l 1 and found that the lowest paa dose investigated 4 mg l 1 only reached a very limited inactivation of bacteria 60 5 and 53 1 removal after 20 min treatment for e coli and enterococci respectively however when the paa dose was increased to 8 or 12 mg l 1 the disinfection efficiency improved significantly one possible reason for this phenomenon is that the low paa concentration did not produce a sufficient amount of free radicals during the process rizzo et al 2019 similarly increasing the uv exposure generally leads to increased microbial inactivation due to the enhancement of both free radical formation and direct uv inactivation zeng et al 2020 furthermore considering both the inactivation effectiveness and the economic cost optimized uv and paa doses should be determined furthermore the ph impacts the solubility of cellular components especially proteins for instance the acid tolerance response in e coli involves acid induced proteins which can protect the cells from an acid shock amiri et al 2010 moreover ph can also influence the generation of reactive radicals in uv paa systems leading to changes in the disinfection performance castillo ledezma et al 2011 xiao et al 2019 temperature may play an important role in the inactivation processes by influencing the metabolism of microorganisms the yield of reactive radicals and the efficiency of chemical reactions between disinfectants and microorganisms however the systematic effects of ph and temperature on the inactivation of microorganisms by uv paa have still not yet been determined in detail thus further investigation on this topic is needed 6 4 3 influence of water composition on disinfection performance wastewater composition often affects the inactivation performance of disinfectants it has been shown that turbidity suspended solids and organic matter can decrease the disinfection efficiency by paa penetration of uv light and hence its efficiency depends on factors such as turbidity uv254 an indicator for total organic carbon and the presence of nh3 n in water hassaballah et al 2020 furthermore wastewater may also contain radical scavengers that reduce the effectiveness of the applied aop weng et al 2018 demonstrated that despite the radicals being formed during uv paa treatment the viruses had reduced opportunity to encounter them in municipal wastewater secondary effluent than in a phosphate buffer solution pbs because of the presence of radical scavengers on the contrary in the study by hassaballah et al 2020 no clear trend between wastewater characteristics and log reductions was observed which may be due to a limited number of wastewater samples used with varying compositions 6 4 4 comparison with uv h2o2 among the various aops the combination of h2o2 and uv light uv h2o2 exhibits a strong synergistic effect which has recently been the subject of great interest for inactivating pathogens in water sun et al 2016 timchak and gitis 2012 previous studies have investigated uv h2o2 and compared its efficiency with uv paa lubello et al 2002 investigated the efficiency of uv paa and uv h2o2 in both laboratory and pilot scale experiments fed by secondary effluent from two municipal wastewater treatment plants the results show that while uv paa and uv h2o2 have the same cost effectiveness uv paa requires lower doses for the same disinfection performance koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 observed increased disinfection efficiency and synergistic effects for all the target enteric bacteria in uv paa treatment while uv h2o2 treatment only slightly influenced the microbial reduction compared to uv alone formisano et al 2016 showed that a lower disinfectant dosage was required in uv paa treatment than uv h2o2 to achieve the same inactivation rate which demonstrates that uv paa is a promising technology for water disinfection 7 opportunities and challenges in paa based aops in summary we have provided an up to date review on the removal of chemical and microbiological pollutants by paa based aops paa based aops were discussed as effective emerging technologies for water decontamination and disinfection many strategies have been developed to activate radical generation from paa which include the most prominent methods based on external energy input e g uv and solar irradiation transition metals and activated carbon catalysts in addition to oh radicals organic per oxyl radicals can also be generated during paa based aops which appear to be more selective in reacting with organic compounds both oh and organic per oxyl radicals contribute to the degradation of organic compounds in water while oh plays a more important role in inactivation of microorganisms paa based aops can be applied to degrade various hazardous organic contaminants such as dyes phenols and pharmaceuticals the degradation efficiency is determined by key parameters such as paa catalyst doses co exiting h2o2 and acetate concentrations solution ph as well as the presence of inorganic anions and nom in the water moreover paa based aops have also shown promise for the inactivation of microorganisms over traditional disinfection methods that may lead to the formation of harmful dbps paa based aops haven been proven to be efficient for the inactivation of microorganisms including bacteria viruses and protozoa in water through the synergistic effects among paa based aops uv paa has attracted the most attention for water disinfection because of the wide use of uv disinfection in waste water treatment plants and the low production of secondary pollution however the published literature has identified several practical challenges in the application of paa based aops first the studied activation methods of paa are mainly based on uv irradiation and metal catalysis the energy cost associated with uv treatment depends on the water quality in a complex way and regardless whether considering a homogeneous or heterogeneous process metal catalysts can inevitably leak metal ions into the treated water which poses a potential environmental risk thus there is a need to develop and validate new effective and eco friendly activation methods for paa secondly the information on the feasibility of paa based aops for the removal of chemical and microbiological pollutants is still rather limited studies on the degradation of emerging contaminants such as endocrine disrupters edcs persistent organic pollutants pops and dbps have largely not been performed yet furthermore for disinfection applications the existing studies have mainly focused on the inactivation of bacteria but other microorganisms such as fungi and algae have not been studied thus far furthermore the effect of paa based aops on bacterial biofilms has received very little attention which would be important to study as most microorganisms growing as biofilms sessile growth form rather than planktonic cells therefore further investigations on the efficiency of paa based aops for pollution control in water should be carried out in most laboratory scale experiments the degradation of organic contaminants by paa based aops is conducted in deionized water with controlled initial concentrations of the target compounds although a couple of research studies on the inactivation of microorganisms by uv paa were conducted in pilot scale experiments employing real wastewater there is still a long way to extend the technology to full scale implementation based on the progress achieved so far and identification of the open questions for disinfection and contaminant degradation by paa based aops in water we suggest the following future topics for research 1 development of new cost effective and environment friendly paa activation methods solar irradiation is one obvious solution that could be studied more actively for paa activation either photolytic or heat activation furthermore other new energy based approaches such as gamma irradiation and ultrasound should be investigated in more detail metal free carbonaceous materials are promising catalysts for paa activation that can minimize the release of dissolved metal ions and therefore the development of new carbonaceous catalysts would reduce the environmental impact of the method 2 systematic investigation of the feasibility of paa based aops for degradation of contaminants and inactivation of microorganisms especially for emerging contaminants and pathogenic microorganisms in water the degradation inactivation kinetics the influence of operational factors and water matrix and the degradation inactivation mechanisms should be systematically determined in order to comprehensively evaluate the technology in addition simultaneous degradation of organic micro pollutants and microbial inactivation in water by paa based aops requires more attention 3 pilot scale studies to demonstrate the scalability of paa based aops for decontamination and or inactivation as uv light treatment is a mature disinfection technology that is extensively used in waste water treatment uv paa has potential as a scalable technology prior to any full scale treatment suitable reactor design for the paa based aop system must be developed and the economic feasibility of the method should be assessed 4 evaluation of the potential environmental impact of paa based aops the existing studies have mostly concentrated on the efficiency of contaminant microorganism removal but the identification of possibly toxic degradation disinfection by products was largely neglected thus toxicity evaluation of the paa based aops should be conducted and suitable control measures be developed if any toxic by products are identified 5 residual paa and possible by product removal from paa aop treated systems in order to obtain good efficiency for water decontamination and disinfection a high concentration of paa may have to be used which may lead to an increase in the effluent organic content therefore it is imperative to develop new methods to remove or recycle the residual paa and eliminate the possible by products it may be possible to reach this goal by integrating activated carbon adsorbent or other filters into the system declaration of competing interest

17393,the elevated cases of arsenic contamination reported across the globe have made its early detection and remediation an active area of research although the world health organisation has set the maximum provisional value for arsenic in drinking water at 10 parts per billion yet concentrations as high as 5000 parts per billion are still reported in human beings chronic arsenic exposure can culminate into lethal diseases such as cancer thus there is a need for urgent emergence of efficient and reliable detection system this paper offers an overview of the state of art knowledge on current arsenic detection mechanisms the central agenda of this paper is to develop an understanding into the nano enabled methods for arsenic detection with an emphasis on strategic fabrication of

poses a major public health threat requiring advanced remediation and sensing solutions as is found in concentrations ranging from 1 5 to 2 parts per million ppm mg l 1 in the continental crust of earth primarily in concentrated forms within sulphide bearing mineral deposits hydrous iron oxides and has strong affinity towards pyrites national research council committee on and biological effects of environmental 1977 nordstrom 2002 the chronic exposure to arsenic contaminated water has led to major health concerns such as abdominal pain skin lesions hyperkeratosis to skin cancer varying with the span of exposure though the maximum permissible limit for as in water varies for different countries but as per the usa environmental protection agency it is limited to 10 parts per billion ppb µg l 1 olavarria fullerton et al 2011 over 140 million people are estimated globally to be exposed daily to as concentrations as high as 5 ppm nordstrom 2002 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 the occurrence of as largely depends on the composition of the water matrix including the ph and high concentrations of silicate phosphate and bicarbonate making selective extraction and sensing protocols challenging appendix 1 arsenic detection is available at both commercial and laboratory scale with a range of field kits appendix 2 analytical methods such as atomic absorption spectrometry aas atomic fluorescence spectrometry biswas et al 2014 hung et al 2004b icp mass spectrometry ms stetzenbach et al 1994 and atomic emission spectrometry hung et al 2004a sansoni et al 1988 reported as detection down to 0 023 ppb 0 002 ppb and 0 001 ppb for aas icp and naa respectively as shown in table s2 marawi et al 1994 sun and yang 1999 yan et al 2002 the gutzeit method based commercial field kits are also recognized as an excellent alternative to laboratory methods providing reasonable limits of detection simple interpretation procedure and fast response rates at very low cost of analysis per sample bird 1901 yogarajah and tsai 2015 despite such developments major limitations of such field kits remain rahman et al 2002 which therefore requires the development of more sensitive remediation and predictive techniques to safeguard consumers nano enabled systems are crucial for the development of novel and ultra sensitive sensors which can be embedded with water purification technologies and employed for monitoring water quality the change in physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials is attributed to change in shape size and composition of the material in nano dimension ngô and van de voorde 2014 nano enabled methods have subsequent advantages over bulk materials such as smaller size high surface to volume ratio quicker response time improved process control reduced leftover and reagent application previous reviews focused on as sensing evaluated methods for monitoring arsenic their advantages and drawbacks with a focus on arsenic speciation sensitivity of

advantages of nano enabled sensors over conventional commercial field kits in arsenic detection and quantification was provided sinha 2014 the potential of nano based materials was reviewed correlating sensing performance namely sensitivity and selectivity to the methods suitability for on site application based on microfluidics yogarajah and tsai 2015 surface enhanced raman spectroscopy hao et al 2015 and electrochemistry kempahanumakkagari et al 2017 the present review provides a critical discussion on recent progress in nano enabled technologies for as detection systematically correlating the morphology properties relationship of such materials to their performance the performance in terms of efficacy and reliability including sensitivity and selectivity will be discussed criteria related to the efficacy and reliability of the strategies will be discussed and normalized data compared to conventional commercial field kits as well as the major laboratory scale techniques last perspectives for nano enabled sensor design will be highlighted and potential research directions proposed to enable the development of new cost effective sensors 2 nano systems based sensing solutions for arsenic detection recent developments in arsenic detection technology have drifted from macro and micro scale materials to nano scale materials for fabricating an ideal sensor that is accurate miniaturised yet less energy consuming nano enabled chemical sensor are comprised of two closely associated elements including a recognition element and a transduction element which translates recognition event into a suitable signal in the following sub sections various nano enabled sensors have been compared based on their structure morphology and properties 2 1 colorimetric sensing colorimetric methods are suitable for monitoring arsenic contamination in water as they are simple visually detectable low cost and realistic gutzeit method based field kits show similar colorimetric response but these commercial field kits produce toxic arsine gas and become unreliable if arsenic is present in trace amount rahman et al 2002 this knowledge gap has led to the development of smarter chromogenic agents that do not generate arsine gas but facilitate easy quick and reliable arsenic ion detection this segment discusses the dye arsenic chemistry based sensors noble metal nanoparticle aggregation based sensors and nano enabled integrated technology based for as ion detection in water molybdate undertakes a renowned reaction with arsenate silicate and phosphate to form their respective heteropolyacid arsenate and phosphate are isoelectronic and their respective heteropolyacids cannot be discriminated from each other however phosphate poses severe interference towards arsenic detection in water thus a simple strategy for detection of arsenate would be to firstly oxidize all the as iii to as v and secondly reducing it all to as iii which does not react with molybdate in the first reaction the sum of phosphate v and arsenate is calculated further in the second reaction only phosphate responds the difference between both values gives the total arsenic content johnson and pilson 1972 speciation capable field device for measurement of as iii and as v in water was reported and an led photodiode based absorbance indicator was used that could detect arsenic to as low as 70 ng l toda et al 2005 several other dye chemistries were explored using the ethyl violet cationic dye and molydoarsenate morita and kaneko 2006 leuco malachite green d revanasiddappa et al 2007 safranine o pasha and narayana 2008 kmno4 hashemi and modasser 2007 coupling complex of sulfanilic acid and n 1 naphthyl ethylene diamine dihydrochloride neda sharma et al 2011 aunps sodium borohydride nabh4 and tracer dye rhodamine b rhb xu et al 2018 based redox reaction antimonyl arseno molybdate complex in the existence of ammonium molybdate potassium antimonyl tartrate ascorbic acid das and sarkar 2016 and benzothiazole schiff base chauhan et al 2017 however these methods are challenged by the issues of selectivity as phosphorus and silicates tend to produce false signals a benzothiazole schiff base was synthesized by one step microwave method which gives prompt colour change from pale yellow to orange in dmso h2o 1 1 v v system on addition of as iii and as v ions the underlying reaction occurs due to bis coordination of as to the n s chelate of synthesized schiff base leading to quick detection of both as iii and as v ions in mixed aqueous system within a matter of 10 s through naked eye chauhan et al 2017 the development of polymer hydrogel based colorimetric strip for detection of as v ions using the reduction reaction between ammonium molybdate and arsenate ions where l ascorbic acid functions as the reducing agent was reported the colorimetric response occurred due to the formation of blue arseno molybdate complex and can be visibly detected down to 10 ppb even after 120 days of storage it retained 95 of its initial detection ability and costs approximately 0 04 das and sarkar 2016 gold nanoparticles aunps are commonly used for colorimetric detection because of their ability to produce dose dependent colorimetric responses enabling control over the colour and the intensity of aunps solution the aunps facilitated colorimetric detection strategies may be subdivided into surface chemistry governed sensing and competitive binding based sensing 2 1 1 surface chemistry based sensing surface functionalization of noble metal nanoparticles using biomolecules such as amino acids peptides etc is the most common surface chemistry that administers arsenic detection in water glutathione gsh l cysteine and dithiothreitol dtt were used for functionalizing aunp wherein the detection was facilitated via chelation triggered by arsenic sulphur linkage as s and arsenic oxygen linkage as o the stability constants between ligands and as iii ions were logk 37 8 dtt 29 84 cys and 32 0 gsh the lod of 5 ppb 20 ppb and 25 ppb were achieved by dtt gsh and l cysteine conjugated aunps respectively to enhance the sensitivity of the detection method dynamic light scattering was employed which reportedly sensed as iii ions down to 0 003 ppb kalluri et al 2009 similar chemistry was demonstrated by dtt functionalized au nanorods with reported lod of 38nm ge et al 2018 the abundance of hydroxyl groups in glucose functionalized aunps and its interaction with as ions triggers aggregation due to reduction of interparticle space yielding lod of 0 53 ppb boruah et al 2019a a polyether compound polyethylene glycol peg modified agnp was reported to function as recognition probe since they possess tunable negative surface charge preventing aggregation of the functionalized silver nanoparticles due to electrostatic repulsion in the case of peg 200 molecules bind perpendicularly to the nanoparticle surface through covalent h or oh bond introduction of as iii ions produce colorimetric response from yellow to bluish detecting as iii ions down to 1 ppb boruah et al 2019b 2 1 2 competitive binding strategy based on the literature competitive binding may be broadly divided into peptide salt and aptamer induced aggregation xia et al reported a phytochelatin like peptide γ glu cys 3 gly arg pc3r comprising thiol moieties was employed for modifying aunps the electrostatic interaction between positively charged guanidine groups and negatively charged aunp surface aids in aggregation however in the presence of as iii ions strong coordination bond is formed between the peptide and arsenic ions blocking this aggregation this strategy reported a lod of 20 nm xia et al 2012 similar reaction mechanism was reported wherein a unique peptide sequence t q s y k h g was obtained from phage peptide library through repetitive positive screening towards as iii ions yang et al 2018b salt induced aggregation based colorimetric sensing was proposed for as iii ion detection using adsorption properties on aunps amid random coil g t rich ssdna and folded dna the synthesized aunps were negatively charged and stable due to electrostatic charge between the nps but when salt was added the aunps tend to aggregate due to screening of the electrostatic repulsion the g t rich ssdna can uncoil and expose its bases which leads to coordination binding between aunps and nitrogen base of these g t rich ssdna preventing the aggregation of aunps at ph 8 0 arsenite comprises of three hydroxy groups that binds to g t rich ssdna through strong hydrogen bonding between oh and amine or ketone groups of the bases in dna as a result a folded compact structure was formed out of the coiled g t rich ssdna this in turn creates more negative charge promoting repulsion between g t rich dna and aunps preventing salt induced aggregation liang et al 2013 similarly ars iii aptamer were used as sensing probe for detection of as iii ions in water reporting the detection limit of 1 26 ppb zhan et al 2014 the interaction between ars iii aptamer aunps and different surfactants or catalysts may be employed for as sensing poly diallyldimethylammonium pdda a water soluble cationic polymer has been reported to facilitate as iii ion detection as it aunp aggregation and also hybridizes with the ars 3 aptamer through electrostatic interaction thus in the absence of as iii ions the ars 3 aptamer hybridizes with pdda to form a duplex and the aunps remain well dispersed in the solution however in the presence of as iii ions ars 3 aptamer reacts first post which pdda aids in aggregation of aunps changing the colour of the solution to blue this method was reported to detect as iii ions down to 5 3 ppb wu et al 2012 ctab cetyltrimethylammonium bromide also works as a binder for as iii ion detection promoting synergistic supramolecular architectures on aunps surface the mechanism of detection is based on the formation of ars iii as iii ion complex as well as the supramolecular complexes generated by ctab leading to the detection down to 16 90 ppb thao nguyen et al 2018 hemin an iron containing porphyrin could detect as iii ion based on the regulation of its catalytic activity in the absence of as iii ions ars iii aptamer binds to hemin resulting in temporary inhibition of the catalytic activity of hemin h2o2 system but on its addition ars iii aptamer forms ars iii as iii complex thus hemin regains its catalytic activity and oxidizes 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine tmb a chromogenic substrate to yield a yellow coloured product diimine the detection limit of 6 ppb was achieved through this selective and sensitive method wu et al 2013 another approach is to integrate multiple methods to develop next generation nanosensors based on microfluidics a paper based microfluidic device incorporating gold sensing probe au ta tg was fabricated this system develops a noticeable bluish black colour precipitate due to the aggregation of nanoparticle through a transverse diffusive mixing of au ta tg with as iii ions on a paper substrate offering a detection limit of 1 0 ppb nath et al 2014 in another instance leucomalachite green lmg dye was employed to probe the reaction between arsenic and potassium iodate and liberate iodine which in turn oxidizes lmg to malachite green mg in the presence of sodium acetate buffer forming a strong green colour on a paper based strip the lod and limit of quantification was 0 19 ppb and 0 64 ppb respectively lace et al 2019 another research integrates colorimetry pdms microfluidics and advanced smartphone application on one platform wherein dtt 10 12 pentacosadiynoic acid pcda and lysine aids aunp aggregation when as iii or hg ii ions interact with them motalebizadeh et al 2018 recently sucrose functionalized aunps were reported for determination of as iii ions using a paper based and smartphone integrated device offering an lod of 4 ppb shrivas et al 2020 lately the choice of base nanomaterial for as ion detection shows drift towards unconventional nanomaterials broadcasting adsorptive affinity towards as ions commonly known as goethitic materials the affinity of as ions towards fe bearing minerals is materialized to address the challenges of specificity and sensitivity the affinity of fe towards as v ions was investigated using dual modes of detection colorimetric and electrochemical based on the activity of peroxidase of feooh nanorods supported by gce feooh nanorods possess peroxidase activity which can be detected by oxidation of colorimetric substrate 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulfonic acid abts to a dark green product abtsox in the presence of h2o2 upon addition of as v ions they adsorb on the surface of feooh nanorods thus inhibiting the peroxidase like activity of synthesized feooh nanorods and consequently decrease the intensity of green colour produced by oxidation product the current decay curves obtained by analysing the interaction of feooh nanorods modified gce and abts represents the inhibition of latter in the presence of as v ions yielding lod down to 0 1 and 0 012 ppb via colorimetric and electrochemical detection respectively zhong et al 2019 considerable potential has been evaluated in colorimetry as it encompasses ease of use cost effectiveness easy visual detection and practicability the only constraint is to strategize an ideal combination of receptor molecule and nanomaterial to obtain true colorimetric responses that are highly specific for arsenic ions the reported literature reflects a deficit of efforts in realizing the real world solution for detection of arsenic therefore more time must be invested in exploring the operational conditions like robustness ph of water impact of potential contaminants and temperature for on site detection of arsenic 2 2 fluorescence methods 2 2 1 generalities on florescence fluorescence based sensing generally employs a fluorophore molecule that is changed by interaction with an analyte there is a change in fluorescence intensity lifetime and anisotropy that is related to energy or charge transfer process markus 2003 sauer 2003 though as detection is broadly limited to surface modified nanomaterials such as carbon nanodots and quantum dots appendix 3 but some nanomaterial independent approaches such as facile bench top glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gadph enzyme catalysed fluorescence assay liu et al 2017 and engaging genetically enhanced green fluorescent proteins egfp gudlavalleti et al 2017 could easily detect as iii ions in the range of 0 200 and 5 100 ppb respectively fret based ratiometric sensor between acriflavine and rhodamine b has been reported to detect as v with the lod of 10 ppb saha et al 2017 fluorescence based sensors function broadly on two mechanisms turn off or turn on based on whether the target analyte quenches fluorescence or promotes fluorescent signals 2 2 2 fluorescence turn off mechanism fluorescence of qds is largely affected by its surface states interaction between target molecules and qds affect the efficacy of electron hole recombination process which is considered as an essential tool for sensing cai et al 2006 selective ligand based surface functionalization of nanomaterials has been materialized for as ion sensing for instance gsh was used for functionalizing the surface of the 4 5 nm cnd gupta et al 2016 similar functionalization of carbon dots cds synthesized from prickly pear cactus show improvised selectivity and sensitivity of sensing probe by surface activated amine hydroxyl and carboxyl groups that can detect arsenic ions down to 2 3 nm radhakrishnan and panneerselvam 2018 zno and qds were combined to take advantage of the nano sized zno which shows good electronic transition from valence band to conduction band insignificant damping in absorption spectrum of zno qds was observed upon serial addition of arsenic stocks as iii as v and the combination of both a band near 385 nm arose due to the excitons decay and shifts to shorter wavelengths as the incorporated as species have larger ionic radii compared to o of zno the as ions were adsorbed on the surface of these ultrasmall fluorescent probes quenching their fluorescence and the process is limited to the surface only thus the sensitivity of the emission pattern of ultra small particles has been exploited for determination of as iii as v and total arsenic down to 27 7 and 28 ppb respectively pal et al 2016 in another study curcumin doped zno zn cur o shows excellent potential towards arsenic sensing over a wide concentration range of 1 3000 ppb moussawi and patra 2016 curcumin chelates to zn through enol form and its doping on the zno surface enhances the excitons emission at 358nm curcumin is believed to fill the surface defects which were luminescence centers and prolonged the e h recombination l cys coated green luminescent water soluble cadmium telluride cdte qds were employed for detection of as iii down to 2 0 nm via displacement of l cys layer from cdte on exposure to as iii ions which creates surface defects on cdte qds resulting in fluorescence quenching vaishanav et al 2017 another class of luminescent material ce iii based coordination polymer nanoparticles ce cpn were reported to detect as iii ions down to 0 7 ppb it was concluded that the uncoordinated carboxyl groups and para methylthio groups of ce cpns reacted with as iii ions through as s and as o linkage leading to linear fluorescence quenching with increasing as iii ion concentration yang et al 2018a 2 2 3 fluorescence turn on mechanisms sometimes the introduction of as ions significantly enhances the emission signals this mechanism is termed as turn on mechanism dtt functionalized carbon quantum dots cqds take advantage of the s s chemistry to inculcate sh functionalities on the np surface and execute as s chemistry for as v ion detection to attain the detection limit of 0 086 ppb pooja et al 2017 the coating agent of qds plays a crucial role in determining their dispersion state cysteamine was chosen for functionalization because it serves as bifunctional ligand which binds to as iii ions via thiol groups and on the other hand use the hydrophilic amine groups for increasing the solubility of cdte zns core shell qds in water cysteamine passivated cdte zns core shell qds are positively charged and the aptamer is negatively charged which creates the possibility for electrostatic interaction between the amino groups of qds and dna producing neutral charge on the surface of qds this will eventually decrease the repulsion between qds and enhance aggregation leading to fluorescence quenching thus on addition of as iii ions it readily forms as iii aptamer complex leading to de aggregation of qds and enhancement of fluorescent signals the detection limit of this approach is 0 0013 ppb ensafi et al 2016 likewise n ce was co doped on carbon dots cdn ce on addition of as iii ions the aptamer restores the partially quenched blue fluorescence of cdn ce because of electrostatic leading to exponentially enhanced fluorescent signals with increasing as iii ion concentration the detection limit of this sensing mechanism is reported to be 0 2 ppb zhang et al 2019 2 2 4 fluorescence turn off on mechanisms fluorescent probe arsenofluor1 is the pioneer chemo sensor for detection of as iii in organic solvents at 298 k and acts as an active off on fluorescence sensor it is thermo stable in both solid and liquid states when stored in dark chemo selective over toxic ions such as hg2 pb2 and cd2 and can detect down to 0 24 ppb ezeh and harrop 2012 another research group reported the sensing system based on oligonucleotide functionalized cuins2 qds fe3o4 nps composite wherein mpa capped cuins2 qds were covalently bound to the amino terminal of oligonucleotide which show symmetric strong fluorescence emission at 656 nm fe3o4 nps adsorbed on the ssdna cuins2 qds by binding to the phosphate backbone of ssdna turning off the fluorescence addition of as v ions to the ssdna cuins2 qds fe3o4 nps composite would turn on the quenched fluorescence as as v ions are adsorbed on fe3o4 nps this method was reported to have the detection limit of 0 13 nmol 1 fluorescence mediated arsenic detection shows highly sensitive quick and selective response towards arsenic ions introduction of nanomaterial in sensing system has helped in attaining lower limits of detection one of the key reasons must be immobilization of appropriate fluorescent probes on nanomaterials that provides abundant surface area for probe analyte interaction eventually enhancing the intensity of fluorescent signals however unspecific binding of analytes in a complex medium poses a major drawback which necessitates discovery of more efficient fluorescent units and suitable nanomaterials that may be used as efficient sensors another challenge is the insolubility of fluorescent probes and qds in water hence development of water soluble fluorescent chemo nanosensor is still an area less explored 2 3 surface sensing methods 2 3 1 surface enhanced raman spectroscopy optically active nanomaterials like noble metal nanoparticles offer a unique platform in arsenic sensing because of their elevated reactivity high electrical conductivity optical effects and better surface area to volume ratio sers is a surface phenomenon that arises from the local amplification of electric field of a metal surface when conduction band electrons resonate with incident light yogarajah and tsai 2015 electromagnetic enhancement mechanism is the prominent contributor in most of the sers processes this enhancement results in amplification of the light by excitation of lsprs of metal nanoparticles appendix 4 sharma et al 2012 fig 1 highlights the key sers strategies used for heavy metal detection which may be divided into two broad categories based on the source of signal generation a probe based sensing wherein the change in the probe molecule on interaction with target analyte regulates the signal generation b raman reporter tag based sensing employs a raman reporter molecule which is attached to the nanoparticle 2 3 2 hotspot generation upon interaction between probe and analyte increasing the number of hotspots generated at the nano junctions of metal nanostructures can intensify electromagnetic field it is noticed that metal nanoparticle nanoclusters exhibit 7 times enhanced signals than isolated bulk metal when raman reporter molecules are attached to the surface of such metal nanostructures the signals are enhanced largely kneipp et al 2006 tang et al 2018 4 mercaptopyridine 4 mpy and 4 mercaptobenzoic acid 4 mba have been mostly used as raman reporters for as ion detection song et al 2016a in table s4 a comparative analysis of the reported nanomaterials with respect to their surface chemistry and sensing efficacy for arsenic detection based on raman is presented 2 3 2 1 raman reporter tag based sensing previously sers mediated detection of as ions was supported by aggregation of nps however these days more preference if given to morphological variations on sers substrate though in the previous reports gsh has assisted in as ion detection yet it was reported that for sers gsh alone could not produce enough sers signals li et al 2011 thus mpy was tagged along with gsh for modification of silver nanoparticles agnps this led to dramatic aggregation of gsh mpy modified agnps due to as o linkage the aggregated agnps produced several hotspots thus enhancing the raman signals greatly because of elevation in electromagnetic field detecting as iii ions down to 0 76 ppb li et al 2011 entry 1 table s4 in 2008 uniform langmuir blodgett lb monolayers of different sizes and shapes of ag nanocrystals were fabricated octahedral nanocrystal with edge length of 250 300 nm demonstrated the optimum differential analysis of arsenic species polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp was considered as an ideal coating as it could sense arsenite and arsenate represented by a peak at 750 and 800 cm 1 respectively down to 1 ppb mulvihill et al 2008 entry 3 table s4 in 2015 the lack of gold nanostructures for fabrication of sers substrate was realized hao et al 2015 subsequently aunps were integrated into sers substrate to enhance the raman signals and the sensitivity of the detection method via target induced aggregation strategy of 4 mpy modified au agnps which is modulated by a cationic polymer poly diallyldimethylammonium pdda and an ars 3 aptamer when as iii ions are absent ars 3 will hybridize with pdda to form a duplex structure leaving 4 mpy modified au agnps well dispersed in the solution yielding a very weak raman signal wu et al 2012 while in the presence of as iii ions ars 3 aptamer forms an aptamer as iii complex electrosteric charge on the pdda disturbs the charge balance encouraging the 4 mpy modified au agnps to aggregate with linear enhancement of raman signal the reported lod was 59 parts per trillion ppt ng l 1 yang et al 2015 entry 4 table s4 another related report explains au ag core shell nanoparticles with a uniform size of 40 nm tagged with 4 mba could detect as iii ions herein as iii aptamer was adsorbed on au ag by coordination interaction between n atom of base and au ag as iii ions could specifically bind to as iii aptamer to form as iii aptamer complex eventually leading to aggregation of au ag the raman signals were enhanced due to the formation of raman hotspots by 4 mba resulting in the lod of 0 1 ppb song et al 2016b entry 5 table s4 there is a significant trend shift in nanomaterials being used as sers substrate and the underlying reaction mechanism of arsenic sensing previously sers based detection was facilitated simply by aggregation of surface modified agnps or aunps but these days it is supported by goethitic surface chemistry ag dendrites doped with feooh were reported to detect total as iii v as iii is oxidized to as v on feooh doped ag dendrites the surface defects arising due to goethitic surface chemistry enhances the chemical sers signals assisting in detection down to 0 001 ppb pradhan et al 2015 entry 6 table s4 to overcome the concerns linked to the irregular and imprecise spread of au or ag nps on the sers substrate three dimensional silver nanoporous films agnpf were fabricated from 20 30 nm thick ag nanowires agnw which were self organized into a 3 µm thick film comprising even nanochannels and ligaments in the range of 30 50 nm to enhance the sensitivity γfe2o3 was doped on the agnpf leading to as v ions detection down to 1 ppb liu et al 2015 entry 7 table s4 similarly agnps decorated αfe2o3 were used as sers substrate to take advantage of the large surface area and increased loading capacity of agnps eventually forming a hot spot rich hierarchical structure this research gives a novel direction for reproducible and highly sensitive detection of arsenic species in water with the lod of 1 5 ppb bekana et al 2018 entry 8 table s4 in near future research efforts must emphasize on controlled assembly of nps to avoid irreproducibility future developments for sers substrates will likely involve spatial control over analytes within hot spots exploration of different sers active metals and differential analysis of as species 2 3 3 surface plasmon resonance surface plasmon is fundamentally reliant on the morphology of nanomaterial composition of nanomaterial nanomaterial size active surface and surrounding environmental media liu et al 2020 the interaction of light and metals or metallic nanostructures is studied in plasmonics alterations in the refractive index that are related to chemical structure or chemical interaction events contributes in developing an understanding for the presence concentration and identity of the target molecule through plasmonics fig 2 represents the key features of the surface plasmon resonance spr based sensing including class of surface functionalization molecules ligand immobilization methods and analyte detection strategies appendix 5 noble metal nanoparticles are ideal for plasmonic studies due to their high stability larger surface area and excellent size shape dependent optical properties the change in colour of suspension is induced by varying interparticle space or aggregation state kelly et al 2003 between target analyte and plasmonic nanostructures the chemistry of arsenic directs that sulphur and amine groups have strong binding affinity towards as iii and v ions and may be used for chelation kalluri et al 2009 this chelation property has been materialised for developing detection strategies for as iii and as v ions in water by simply functionalizing the nanoparticle surface with suitable thiol or amine group recognition molecules some of the reported recognition molecules that have been used for aunp surface functionalization assisting trace level arsenic detection are lauryl sulphate shrivas et al 2015 and gsh dtt cys pdca domínguez gonzález et al 2014 with an lod ranging from 2 5 ppb to 10 ppt each as iii ion can bind to three dtt conjugated aunps by as s linkage however in gsh and cys there are no available sulphur groups resulting in binding of as iii via as o linkage kalluri et al 2009 surface functionalised gold film with recognition element and a reference area unable to absorb arsenic could support the detection of arsenic down to 1 ppb with gsh sensing probe 3 ppt with dtt probe and 1 ppt with n dithiocarboxy n methyl d glucamine dtgluc probe forzani et al 2007 label free gold nanorods with a length of 72 nm and a diameter of 29 nm were employed for as iii ion sensing based on non aggregation and inhibition of oxidative shortening of au nanorods this strategy is largely reliant on the shape dependent optical properties of the local surface plasmon resonance band of au nanorods in the presence of fe iii the lod of 10 ppb was achieved and the primary focus of this research was to overcome the unnecessary aggregation of aunps producing false signals as well as unspecific reactions that are frequently encountered das et al 2019 poly allylamine hydrochloride pah consists of amine functionalities leading to electrostatic and selective complexation between pah and as v ions this sensing strategy employs single 50 nm pah modified aunp plasmon to negate the ensemble average effects and reduce the probability of irrelevant reactions the limit of detection for this strategy was 10 nm hong et al 2011 incorporating competitive binding of biomaterials such as phytochelatin like peptides ϒ glu cys 3 gly arg pc3r xia et al 2012 ars aptamer with nacl and ctab thao nguyen et al 2018 wu et al 2012 peg 300 glucose boruah et al 2019a boruah et al 2019b au doped carbon dots nanosols zhang et al 2020 and by exploiting the inhibitory effect of as species on bio catalytic activity of acid phosphatase acp zhang et al 2016 assists nanomaterials for enhanced bio sensing of as species modulating the surface topology of the nanomaterials to obtain more adsorption sites for specific receptor probes to attach and consequently offering more reactive sites for as ions attachment is gaining attention for instance a hybrid platform which comprises of amine functionalized radially porous silica particles was employed over a gold thin film these silica particles have radially oriented mesopores whose size increases from the center to outer surface providing large surface area for receptor analyte interaction and lower detection limit of 1 0 nm choi et al 2014 a polypyrrole chitosan cobalt ferrite nanoparticles composite layer was electrodeposited on a gold coated glass slide the thickness of this sensing layer was 66 nm and the selective sensing of as v ions was facilitated by chitosan chitosan serve as the main recognition probe for as v ion sensing through four amino groups in a square planar geometry and the cofe2o4 nanoparticles adsorbed as v ions due to defect induced ferromagnetism in this strategy the combination of surface chemistry and physical property of nanomaterials could detect as v ions down to 1 ppb sadrolhosseini et al 2017 surface plasmon resonance based arsenic sensing has progressed greatly and embraces a great potential in the future of visual quantification research must be focused towards improving the reproducibility of spr sensing by fine tuning and monitoring nanomaterial synthesis process another essential parameter that needs urgent attention is the unspecific interactions between ligands and interferents along with the stability of their binding furthermore chemical functionalization is susceptible to surface saturation and fouling leading to inconsistent responses on higher concentration which must be extensively researched 2 4 electrochemical methods electrochemical sensors using various nano and micro materials that offer novel prospects with benefits such as improved sensitivity and selectivity quick response and cost effectiveness have been established electrochemical techniques are considered reliable and user friendly because they follow reagent less simple and low cost procedures zaib et al 2015 this section will hence summarise the novel electrochemical approaches implemented for detection of as ions based on the cumulative knowledge gaps within electrochemical sensing strategies reported till date the properties of these surface modifications will be evaluated on the basis of the performance of electrode in detection of as ions 2 4 1 selective ligand based arsenic detection ligands play an important role in determining the performance of a particular sensor as ion detection has been facilitated extensively by ligands rich in thiol group the synergistic effect of gsh dtt and n acetyl l cysteine was investigated by fabricating a self assembled layer on the surface of au electrode for as iii detection the three ligands were immobilized on the electrode surface via au s interaction while on the other side of this monolayer hydroxyl or sulfhydryl groups were present for chelation of as iii ions by the virtue of as o or as s linkage these ligands created a three dimensional triple layer hierarchical structure due to distinct chain lengths of the ligand such nanoarchitecture led to abundant binding of as iii moieties on the electrode facilitating facile electron transfer due to close proximity of as iii ions resulting in lod down to 0 5 and 0 3 ppb in controlled matrix and real water sample respectively chen et al 2011 similarly mercaptoethylamine mea was immobilized on au electrode surface to achieve better sensitivity and to overcome the interference from cu ions the electrode surface was functionalized with mea via au s linkage and two carbon alkyl chains with long alkane chains were used to block the conduction of electrons to the electrode surface moreover amine groups possessing positive charge aided in repulsion of cu ii ions away from the au surface due to electrostatic interaction as well as chelates as iii ions through as n interaction offering the lod of 0 2 ppb the proposed electrode detects as iii ions in phosphate buffer at ph 7 0 which shows the potential of this electrode to detect as iii ions in real water samples li et al 2012 similar mechanism was employed for multimodal detection of arsenic using gsh dtt and asparagine modified agnps sensing arsenic down to 0 36 ppb and 5 2 ppt respectively via colorimetry and electrochemistry wen et al 2018 e n 2 nitrobenzylidene benzenesulfonohydrazide nbbsh was assembled on the gce wherein three molecules of nbbsh form a complex with as iii ions via donation of two electrons from each compound this nbbsh nafion modified gce shows best response at ph 7 demonstrating an excellent lod of 50 pm rahman et al 2019 2 4 2 morphology and topology of nanomaterial for arsenic sensing noble metal nanoparticles and exploration into different strategies to develop noble metal hierarchical nanostructures have constantly facilitated the selective and sensitive as ion sensing although high sensitivity and selectivity has been reported using the au and aunps modified electrode yet the major constraints of interference from cu ii ions in natural water high detection potential and interference from supporting electrolyte anions remain unaddressed anodic stripping voltammetric asv detection of as iii ions is mostly challenged by cu ii ion interference either due to increase or decrease in stripping current depending on the cu ii ion concentration hence restricting the design of au based arsenic sensors for analysis of real water samples proposes improved ventures the crystallographic orientation of aunps plays an important role in determining its impact on electrochemical sensing fabrication of self assembled monolayers sams of thiol short chains on au electrodes are an interesting process to attain single crystallographic domain at the polycrystalline gold poly au electrode at the molecular level potential controlled partial desorption of the sam can selectively block domains of poly au surface leaving other domains bare thus au 111 like poly au electrode was fabricated by forming a sub monolayer of n butyl thiol n bt it was observed that the n bt blocks the au 110 and au 100 domains on poly au surface leaving au 111 domain free additionally appropriate lateral interactions between alkane chains were anticipated for compact coverage the reported lod was 0 28 ppb without any cu ii ion interference rahman et al 2010 the micro nano electrode ensembles offer many advantages over macroelectrodes such as decreased resistance from solution low detection limit better signal to noise ratio and increased mass transport ideally it is expected that detection limits of ultra microelectrode ensemble must be much lower than macrosized electrodes because of the ratio of faradic to capacitive current is considerably high at the ensemble an attempt to explore the same was reported using self assemblies of 3 mercaptopropyl trimethoxy silane mpts on poly au electrode which exists as 3 dimensional silicate network with abundance of sh groups yielding a highly sensitive as iii detection down to 0 02 ppb kumar jena and retna raj 2008 stripping techniques also play a crucial role in electrochemical analysis facilitating preconcentration of metal phase onto electrode surface as well as selective oxidation of each metal phase during an anodic potential steep keeping these benefits in view a flow through anodic stripping chronopotentiometric method was developed for fast and simultaneous analysis of both the inorganic as species au wire electrode was employed for as v sensing at a negative potential in acidic conditions with the reported lod of 0 42 ppb for as iii ions and 0 55 ppb for as v ions jedryczko et al 2016 similarly an electroactive nano textured au electrode au gne assemblage demonstrated enhanced electron transfer due to its unique assembly which facilitates better electro oxidation of as iii ion down to 0 08 ppb babar et al 2019 2 4 3 strategies to overcome cu ii ion interference amongst all the interferents of as iii ion detection cu ii presents the most interference on the gold macro electrodes cu ii codeposits with as iii ions during the deposition step to form intermetallic compound cu3as2 though the stripping peak of cu ii is slightly more positive than as iii stripping peak yet when cu ii is present in high concentration it masks the as iii peak dai and compton 2005 a way to overcome this interference was involving ammonia the interference of cu ii was addressed by using the complexation chemistry between nh3 and cu ii ions a cathodic shift was observed on addition of ammonia indicating at the successful complex formation and the ph of the electrolyte shifted from 3 to 9 idris et al 2016 aunps embedded nafion nf composite was synthesized by cu i mediated noble metal reduction briefly cu ii ions were reduced to cu i in cathodic potential scan cu i further accumulated in nf modified layer and serves as movable mediator cu i is chemically re oxidized to cu ii in the presence of aucl4 this electrochemical catalytic process reduces aucl4 to au the chemically restored cu ii was reduced to cu i on the surface of the electrode consequently encouraging the formation of zero valent au in the nafion modified layer continually the nafion aunps composite offers two benefits a highly dense and uniform layer of aunps which aids in sensitive electro analysis of as iii ions and nafion serves as a chemically inert and stable binder which helps in preconcentration of cation and better resistance to interfering ions the as prepared nafion aunps composite on glassy carbon electrode gce has high sensitivity towards as iii ions as the result of large electrochemical surface area offering lod of 0 047 ppb huang and chen 2013 2 4 4 carbon nanomaterials based sensing noble metal free nanoparticles or nanocomposites have gained attention from the scientific community because of their excellent catalytic activities electrical conductivity quick mass and electron transfer and high surface area aragay et al 2011 carbon nanotubes cnts especially multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts were employed for gold electrode surface modification mwcnt are less stable and possess more structural defects compared to single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts thus they are likely to enhance the electron transfer and provide abundant active sites for as iii ions to attach these mwcnts were attached to the electrode surface through sh groups and the exposed side of these cnts possessed sh moieties for targeted as iii ion binding the developed electrode could detect total arsenic as iii as v and as iii ions in natural and high salinity waters profumo et al 2006 aunps modified cnts were immobilized on gce through a simple drop casting and evaporation method the ideology behind aunps coverage on cnts was to enhance surface area and electroactivity of the electrode swv and lsv were performed in an optimized system with deposition time of 120 s with the lod of 0 1 ppb xiao et al 2008 a cost effective solution is to use carbon based materials such as three dimensional porous graphitic carbon nitrides g c3n4 decorated with aunps on a gce which promotes the reduction of as iii ions due to its rich electronic state narrow band gap high adsorption capability and good dispersion capability facilitating aunps with additional active sites and better electrical conductivity bu et al 2020 2 4 5 redox cycle based sensing some reports propose materials to reduce the production cost of nanomaterials to introduce new properties for enhancing the detection iron nanoparticles fenps are integrated with noble metal nps such as pt pd and au to form bimetallic nps which serve as low cost catalysts in optimized conditions an attempt to achieve the same resulted in the development of fept nps which serve as an excellent sensing probe compared to pristine nps the si 100 electrode was modified with fept nps which was reported to detect as iii ions down to 0 8 ppb and overcome the cu ii ion interference because bimetallic nps such as fept possess more d vacancies than pt nps improving the adsorption and oxidation of as species the fept nps modified si electrode shifts the oxidation potential of as 0 to as iii to more positive potential 0 13 v while the oxidation potential of cu 0 to cu ii is shifted to more negative potential 0 3 v moghimi et al 2015 mno2 also plays an important role as an oxidant in the arsenic removal process thus it was deduced that doping mn oxides with fe oxides could provide synergistic effect in arsenic removal and provide better electrochemical reactivity mesoporous mnfe2o4 nanocrystals were immobilized to attain large contact area of the electrode electrolyte interface in electrochemical detection of as iii ions by swasv the limit of detection achieved was 1 95 ppb in optimized conditions zhou et al 2015 another work reported the aunp decorated mesoporous mnfe2o4 nanocrystal clusters the aunps of 13 nm diameter were supported mnfe2o4 nanospheres of 350 nm diameter gce was chosen as the electrode of interest the electrochemical reaction between the 3 aminopropyl trimethoxysilane aptms functionalized mnfe2o4 au hybrid nanospheres modified gce and as iii ions were mediated under 0 1m naac hac ph 5 0 the amine groups of aptms were responsible for sensing as iii ions the lod of proposed sensor was 3 37 ppb zhou et al 2016 metal organic framework mof offers abundant tunable pore size and surface to volume ratios which act as favourable scaffolds for as iii ion sensing kumar et al 2015 usman et al 2020 in an instance the nanostructure of au ultra microelectrodes and fe oxide were used for developing a hybrid nanomaterial pyrolysis treatment was employed for fabricating the stepwise assembly of porous fe oxide based ag au porous nanoshells which were used to modify gce the synergistic properties of both the nanomaterials imparted highly adsorptive and sensitive micro reactive sites which consequently enhance the electrocatalytic properties of the proposed hybrid nanomaterial resulting in as iii ion detection down to 0 01 ppb zhao et al 2018 zinc based mofs demonstrated high adsorption capability when the electronic properties of graphene sheets were combined with the adsorption ability of zn centred mofs to allow for as iii ions detection at trace levels sem images confirmed that the deposition semi spherical of zn mofs on layer like structure expectedly graphene oxide this hybrid nanomaterial modified gce was employed for as iii ion detection by oh substitution of znoh sites for the formation of an inner complex zn o as the lod of 0 06 ppb was obtained by using this nanohybrid material baghayeri et al 2020 poly l lactide stabilized aunps modified screen printed electrode pla aunp spe and stable structures led to the detection of as iii ions down to 0 09 ppb song et al 2006 the active surface area of pt electrode was amplified by immobilization of pd nps in the presence of a surfactant sds it was concluded that maximum redox currents were obtained in the following trend pt pt pd pt pdsds the peak currents were increased by 48 and only 27 in pt pdsds and pt pd electrode respectively it was concluded that the porosity of the catalytic matrix was probably developed upon deposition of pd nps in the presence of sds molecule the lod of 0 2 ppb was attained by pt pdsds electrode the arsenite oxidation occurred in a stepwise mechanism forming a metastable as iv species before finally converting into as v alam et al 2018 2 5 goethitic chemistry based sensing the goethitic chemistry of arsenic has been often used as its detection strategy because fe serves as an excellent adsorbent of as ions yavuz et al 2006 thus the combination of aunps and fe3o4 lead to the development of highly conductive and adsorptive nanomaterial facilitating highly sensitive as iii detection as iii ions first adsorb on the surface of such nanomaterials further released on the surface of electrode for redox reaction fe ii works as electro catalyst since surface activated fe ii donates an electron to form fe iii during the reduction of as iii to as 0 then fe iii gets an electron from the electrode during the oxidation of as 0 to as iii completing the fe ii fe iii cycle the fe ii fe iii cycle and aunps synergistically contribute towards the sensitive electrochemical detection of as iii ions down to 0 0215 ppb li et al 2018a similar research as conducted to highlight the importance of surface defects of co0 6fe2 4o4 nanocubes the combination of co and fe administers enhanced adsorptive capability and catalytic activity since electrochemical detection is a process that is mediated by gain or loss of electrons which can be regulated by cu ii to cu iii and fe ii to fe iii cycle between as iii ions and co0 6fe2 4o4 nanocubes modified glassy carbon plate gcp li et al 2018b related surface chemistry was employed for developing aunps decorated fe3o4 nanospheres covered by room temperature ionic liquid and supported by screen printed electrode the modified electrode was highly sensitive to as iii ions at near neutral ph 5 0 detecting down to 2 2 ppt wei et al 2016 3 integrated technology based sensing recently focus has shifted to miniaturizing the electrochemical detection platform by integrating electrochemistry with microfluidics such systems when integrated will provide sample preparation sensor preconditioning and analysis on a single microfluidic chip modular microfluidics employs different modules which can be easily put together for assisting as iii ion detection on a single microfluidic device wherein first as iii sample is preconditioned for accumulation followed by stripping of the metal ion to produce analytical signals this integrated system was reported to detect as iii ions down to 0 42 ppb giménez gómez et al 2019 the presence of micro nano junctions in the microchannel exhibit different phenomena such as ion depletion ion exclusion and amplified electrokinetic trapping effects electrochemical trapping uses real time feedback based on the position of particle in the system to eliminate the particle s brownian motion in electrokinetic trapping when external electric field is applied ion imbalance amongst micro and nano channels is generated forming a concentration gradient near the interface of micro nanochannels an electronegative membrane is generally placed at the micro nano junctions with preferably cation permeability which is caused by acidic impurities present on the pores of the membrane this technique is termed as ion concentration polarization icp however the key concern met by icp device is the deficiency of quantification analysis for concentrated ions to overcome this limitation radial channels icp device was fabricated and electrodes were attached to this fabricated system for as iii ion detection the lod of 1 ppb was achieved using only 40 µl of sample in such integrated system subramanian et al 2020 the electrochemical detection of as ions have been largely explored and the accomplishments so far have also been rewarding yet electro analysis method with proficient anti interference towards competing ions in the natural water ph is still scarce and critical one of the most vital steps in electrochemical determination of as ions is the deposition time of metals which must be reduced without compromising the capability of arsenic detection alternative inexpensive material based electrodes electrode surface renewal and improved designs to handle surface fouling must be taken into consideration 4 challenges and the potential trend shift in nano enabled arsenic detection we evaluate the different detection methods based on the lods offered by them the most common strategy that is used for as ion detection is the interaction between sh group of selective ligand usually gsh dtt or l cysteine and as ion in the literature colorimetric sensing using this chemistry has reported the lod between 5 25 ppb kalluri et al 2009 spr based sensing reported the lod of 1 ppb forzani et al 2007 sers based sensing reported the lod of 0 76 ppb li et al 2011 and electrochemistry based sensing reported the lod of 0 3 0 5 ppb chen et al 2011 though electrochemical arsenic detection method shows the best sensitivity yet when it comes to point of use sensor lack of field applicability is witnessed on the other hand noble metal plasmonic sensing offers selective sensitive cost effective and field applicable platform for arsenic detection a point of debate might arise when it comes to the cost effectiveness of these noble metal nanoparticles the cost dynamics at laboratory scale might be high however at commercial scale the fabrication cost may be slashed down to half or even lower it has been shown that microfluidics have been integrated with electronics and inkjet technology onto a single lab on a chip the fabrication of this technology costs usd 0 01 esfandyarpour et al 2017 another classic example is the boom in the cnt market over the span of ten years the price of cnts was higher than gold usd 45 g 1 but today it is slashed down to usd 0 1 25 g 1 and usd 50 400 g 1 for mwcnts and swcnts respectively zhang et al 2013 therefore with these advancements the challenges of sensitivity selectivity and affordability might be curbed further advancements in the material chemistry and technology approaches might extend the applicability of these technologies to water deployable field kits 5 conclusions and prospects arsenic in groundwater is a major concern globally and has been testified in numerous regions around the globe till date conventional field kits have been used widely to quantify arsenic in contaminated waters however thorough evaluation and assessment of these kits have raised questions about their selectivity and sensitivity designing ultrasensitive sensors requires lock and key principle to work between the target analyte and recognition probe thus the research has mostly revolved around nanomaterial fabrication and the modulation of surface functionality which is exclusively selective for arsenic ions however the main challenges to overcome are primarily related to the impact that competing ions have on selective analyte detection the translation of the most promising sensors beyond laboratory conditions in controlled matrices is also required and more studies looking at such scale up aspects are dearly needed advanced chemical mechanisms by both experimental and modelling approaches towards improved anti interference strategies shall be further explored with nano engineering to tune predict and control the interactions between arsenic species and nanomaterial surfaces the success of disabling current restrains in strategies will facilitate the prevention and management of highly as contaminated water sources nano enabled sensors have already progressed providing ultrasensitive detection capabilities benefiting from enhanced properties at the nanoscale the smart engineering of the nano enabled sensors from the control of active sites for arsenic ion attachment as well as the miniaturization of the system becomes essential porous materials such as cofs mofs offer promising prospects in arsenic sensing also nanocomposites and multi component nanomaterials consisting dual or triple composite nanostructures are reported to exhibit improved sensitivity and selectivity compared to single nanomaterial amalgamation or hybridization of different nanomaterials must be explored for potentially using such nanostructures for arsenic detection the stability and selectivity of nano enabled sensors may be achieved by controlling the synthesis process surface properties and geometric assembly of nanomaterials lastly the concept of microfluidics offers an excellent platform for developing an ideal nanosensor having integrated multiple techniques on a chip this may possibly negate the cross talks between different ions and support selective and ultra sensitive arsenic detection requiring smartly designed preconcentration and processing units finally there is a need to define the regeneration method of nano enabled arsenic sensing systems which must be considered as advancement towards development of cost effective and environment friendly arsenic sensing technologies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

l 1 olavarria fullerton et al 2011 over 140 million people are estimated globally to be exposed daily to as concentrations as high as 5 ppm nordstrom 2002 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 the occurrence of as largely depends on the composition of the water matrix including the ph and high concentrations of silicate phosphate and bicarbonate making selective extraction and sensing protocols challenging appendix 1 arsenic detection is available at both commercial and laboratory scale with a range of field kits appendix 2 analytical methods such as atomic absorption spectrometry aas atomic fluorescence spectrometry biswas et al 2014 hung et al 2004b icp mass spectrometry ms stetzenbach et al 1994 and atomic emission spectrometry hung et al 2004a sansoni et al 1988 reported as detection

sample bird 1901 yogarajah and tsai 2015 despite such developments major limitations of such field kits remain rahman et al 2002 which therefore requires the development of more sensitive remediation and predictive techniques to safeguard consumers nano enabled systems are crucial for the development of novel and ultra sensitive sensors which can be embedded with water purification technologies and employed for monitoring water quality the change in physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials is attributed to change in shape size and composition of the material in nano dimension ngô and van de voorde 2014 nano enabled methods have subsequent advantages over bulk materials such as smaller size high surface to volume ratio quicker response time improved process control reduced

last perspectives for nano enabled sensor design will be highlighted and potential research directions proposed to enable the development of new cost effective sensors 2 nano systems based sensing solutions for arsenic detection recent developments in arsenic detection technology have drifted from macro and micro scale materials to nano scale materials for fabricating an ideal sensor that is accurate miniaturised yet less energy consuming nano enabled chemical sensor are comprised of two closely associated elements including a recognition element and a transduction element which translates recognition event into a suitable signal in the following sub sections various nano enabled sensors have been compared based on their structure morphology and properties 2 1 colorimetric sensing colorimetric methods are suitable for monitoring arsenic contamination in water as they are simple visually detectable low cost and realistic gutzeit method based field kits show similar colorimetric response but these commercial field kits produce toxic arsine gas and become unreliable if arsenic is present in trace amount rahman et al 2002 this knowledge gap has led to the development of smarter chromogenic agents that do not generate arsine gas but facilitate easy quick and reliable arsenic ion detection this segment discusses the dye arsenic chemistry based sensors noble metal nanoparticle aggregation based sensors and nano enabled integrated technology based for as ion detection in water molybdate undertakes a renowned reaction with arsenate silicate and phosphate to form their respective heteropolyacid arsenate and phosphate are isoelectronic and their respective heteropolyacids cannot be discriminated from each other however phosphate poses severe interference towards arsenic detection in water thus a simple strategy for detection of arsenate would be to firstly oxidize all the as iii to as v and secondly reducing it all to as iii which does not react with molybdate in the first reaction the sum of phosphate v and arsenate is calculated further in the second reaction only phosphate responds the difference between both values gives the total arsenic content johnson and pilson 1972 speciation capable field device for measurement of as iii and as v in water was reported and an led photodiode based absorbance indicator was used that could detect arsenic to as low as 70 ng l toda et al 2005 several other dye chemistries were explored using the ethyl violet cationic dye and molydoarsenate morita and kaneko 2006 leuco malachite

antimonyl tartrate ascorbic acid das and sarkar 2016 and benzothiazole schiff base chauhan et al 2017 however these methods are challenged by the issues of selectivity as phosphorus and silicates tend to produce false signals a benzothiazole schiff base was synthesized by one step microwave method which gives prompt colour change from pale yellow to orange in dmso h2o 1 1 v v system on addition of as iii and as v ions the underlying reaction occurs due to bis coordination of as to the n s chelate of synthesized schiff base leading to quick detection of both as iii and as v ions in mixed aqueous system within a matter of 10 s through naked eye chauhan et al 2017 the development of polymer hydrogel based colorimetric strip for detection of as v ions using the reduction reaction between ammonium molybdate and arsenate ions where l ascorbic acid functions as the reducing agent was reported the colorimetric response occurred due to the formation of blue arseno molybdate complex and can be visibly detected down to 10 ppb even after 120 days of storage it retained 95 of its initial detection ability and costs approximately 0 04 das and sarkar 2016 gold nanoparticles aunps are commonly used for colorimetric detection because of their ability to produce dose dependent colorimetric responses enabling control over the colour and the intensity of aunps solution the aunps facilitated colorimetric detection strategies may be subdivided into surface chemistry governed sensing and competitive binding based sensing 2 1 1 surface chemistry based sensing surface functionalization of noble metal nanoparticles using biomolecules such as amino acids peptides etc is the most common surface chemistry that administers arsenic detection in water glutathione gsh l cysteine and dithiothreitol dtt were used for functionalizing aunp wherein the detection was facilitated via chelation triggered by arsenic sulphur linkage as s and arsenic oxygen linkage as o the stability

tunable negative surface charge preventing aggregation of the functionalized silver nanoparticles due to electrostatic repulsion in the case of peg 200 molecules bind perpendicularly to the nanoparticle surface through covalent h or oh bond introduction of as iii ions produce colorimetric response from yellow to bluish detecting as iii ions down to 1 ppb boruah et al 2019b 2 1 2 competitive binding strategy based on the literature competitive binding may be broadly divided into peptide salt and aptamer induced aggregation xia et al reported a phytochelatin like peptide γ glu cys 3 gly arg pc3r comprising thiol moieties was employed for modifying aunps the electrostatic interaction between positively charged guanidine groups and negatively charged aunp surface aids in aggregation however in the presence of as iii ions strong coordination bond is formed between the peptide and arsenic ions blocking this aggregation this strategy reported a lod of 20 nm xia et al

al 2018b salt induced aggregation based colorimetric sensing was proposed for as iii ion detection using adsorption properties on aunps amid random coil g t rich ssdna and folded dna the synthesized aunps were negatively charged and stable due to electrostatic charge between the nps but when salt was added the aunps tend to aggregate due to screening of the electrostatic repulsion the g t rich ssdna can uncoil and expose its bases which leads to coordination binding between aunps and nitrogen base of these g t rich ssdna preventing the aggregation of aunps at ph 8 0 arsenite comprises of three hydroxy groups that binds to g t rich ssdna through strong hydrogen bonding between oh and amine or ketone groups of the bases in dna as a result a folded compact structure was formed out of the coiled g t rich ssdna this in turn creates more negative charge promoting repulsion between g t rich dna and aunps preventing salt induced aggregation liang et al 2013 similarly ars iii aptamer were used as sensing probe for detection of as iii ions in water reporting the detection limit of 1 26 ppb zhan et al 2014 the interaction between ars iii aptamer aunps and different surfactants or catalysts may be employed for as sensing poly diallyldimethylammonium pdda a water soluble cationic polymer has been reported to facilitate as iii ion detection as it aunp aggregation and also hybridizes with the ars 3 aptamer through electrostatic interaction thus in the absence of as iii ions the ars 3 aptamer hybridizes with pdda to form a duplex and the aunps remain well dispersed in the solution however in the presence of as iii ions ars 3 aptamer reacts first post which pdda aids in aggregation of aunps changing the colour of the solution to blue this method was reported to detect as iii ions down to 5 3 ppb wu et al 2012 ctab cetyltrimethylammonium bromide also works as a binder for as iii ion detection promoting synergistic supramolecular architectures on aunps surface the mechanism of detection is based on the formation of ars iii as iii ion complex as well as the supramolecular complexes generated by ctab leading to the detection down to 16 90 ppb thao nguyen et al 2018 hemin an iron containing porphyrin could detect as iii ion based on the regulation of its catalytic activity in the absence of as iii ions ars iii aptamer binds to hemin resulting in temporary inhibition of the catalytic activity of hemin h2o2 system but on its addition ars iii aptamer forms ars iii as iii complex thus hemin regains its catalytic activity and oxidizes 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine tmb a chromogenic substrate to yield a yellow coloured product diimine the detection limit of 6 ppb was achieved through this selective and sensitive method wu et al 2013 another approach is to integrate multiple methods to develop next generation nanosensors based on microfluidics a paper based microfluidic device incorporating gold sensing probe au ta tg was fabricated this system develops a noticeable bluish black colour precipitate due to the aggregation of nanoparticle through a transverse diffusive mixing of au ta tg with as iii ions on a paper substrate offering a detection limit of 1 0 ppb nath et al 2014 in another instance leucomalachite green lmg dye was employed to probe the reaction between arsenic and potassium iodate and liberate iodine which in turn oxidizes lmg to malachite green mg in the presence of sodium acetate buffer forming a strong green colour on a paper based strip the lod and limit of quantification was 0 19 ppb and 0 64 ppb respectively lace et al 2019 another research integrates colorimetry pdms microfluidics and advanced smartphone application on one platform wherein dtt 10 12 pentacosadiynoic acid pcda and lysine aids aunp aggregation when as iii or hg ii ions interact with them motalebizadeh et al 2018 recently sucrose functionalized aunps were reported for determination of as iii ions using a paper based and smartphone integrated device offering an lod of 4 ppb shrivas et al 2020 lately the choice of base nanomaterial for as ion detection shows drift towards unconventional nanomaterials broadcasting adsorptive affinity towards as ions commonly known as goethitic materials the affinity of as ions towards fe bearing minerals is materialized to address the challenges of specificity and sensitivity the affinity of fe towards as v ions was investigated using dual modes of detection colorimetric and electrochemical based on the activity of peroxidase of feooh nanorods supported by gce feooh nanorods possess peroxidase activity which can be detected by oxidation of colorimetric substrate 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulfonic acid abts to a dark green product abtsox in the presence of h2o2 upon addition of as v ions they adsorb on the surface of feooh nanorods thus inhibiting the peroxidase like activity of synthesized feooh nanorods and consequently decrease the intensity of green colour produced by oxidation product the current decay curves obtained by analysing the interaction of feooh nanorods modified gce and abts represents the inhibition of latter in the presence of as v ions yielding lod down to 0 1 and 0 012 ppb via colorimetric and electrochemical detection respectively zhong et al 2019 considerable potential has been evaluated in colorimetry as it encompasses ease of use cost effectiveness easy visual detection and practicability the only constraint is to strategize an ideal combination of receptor molecule and nanomaterial to obtain true colorimetric responses that are highly specific for arsenic ions the reported literature reflects a deficit of efforts in realizing the real world solution for detection of arsenic therefore more time must be invested in exploring the operational conditions like robustness ph of water impact of potential contaminants and temperature for on site detection of arsenic 2 2 fluorescence methods 2 2 1 generalities on florescence fluorescence based sensing generally employs a fluorophore molecule that is changed by interaction with an analyte there is a change in fluorescence intensity lifetime and anisotropy that is related to energy or charge transfer process markus 2003 sauer 2003 though as detection is broadly limited to surface modified nanomaterials such as carbon nanodots and quantum dots appendix 3 but some nanomaterial independent approaches such as facile bench top glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gadph enzyme catalysed fluorescence assay liu et al 2017 and engaging genetically enhanced green fluorescent proteins egfp gudlavalleti et al 2017 could easily detect as iii ions in the range of 0 200 and 5 100 ppb respectively fret based ratiometric sensor between acriflavine and rhodamine b has been reported to detect as v with the lod of 10 ppb saha et al 2017 fluorescence based sensors function broadly on two mechanisms turn off or turn on based on whether the target analyte quenches fluorescence or promotes fluorescent signals 2 2 2 fluorescence turn off mechanism fluorescence of qds is largely affected by its surface states interaction between target molecules and qds affect the efficacy of electron hole recombination process which is considered as an essential tool for sensing cai et al 2006 selective ligand based surface functionalization of nanomaterials has been materialized for as ion sensing for instance gsh was used for functionalizing the surface of the 4 5 nm cnd gupta et al 2016 similar functionalization of carbon dots cds synthesized from prickly pear cactus show improvised selectivity and sensitivity of sensing probe by surface activated amine hydroxyl and carboxyl groups that can detect arsenic ions down to 2 3 nm radhakrishnan and panneerselvam 2018 zno and qds were combined to take advantage of the nano sized zno which shows good electronic transition from valence band to conduction band insignificant damping in absorption spectrum of zno qds was observed upon serial addition of arsenic stocks as iii as v and the combination of both a band near 385 nm arose due to the excitons decay and shifts to shorter wavelengths as the incorporated as species have larger ionic radii compared to o of zno the as ions were adsorbed on the surface of these ultrasmall fluorescent probes quenching their fluorescence and the process is limited to the surface only thus the sensitivity of the emission pattern of ultra small particles has been exploited for determination of as iii as v and total arsenic down to 27 7 and 28 ppb respectively pal et al 2016 in another study curcumin doped zno zn cur o shows excellent potential towards arsenic sensing over a wide concentration range of 1 3000 ppb moussawi and patra 2016 curcumin chelates to zn through enol form and its doping on the zno surface enhances the excitons emission at 358nm curcumin is believed to fill the surface defects which were luminescence centers and prolonged the e h recombination l cys coated green luminescent water soluble cadmium telluride cdte qds were employed for detection of as iii down to 2 0 nm via displacement of l cys layer from cdte on exposure to as iii ions which creates surface defects on cdte qds resulting in fluorescence quenching vaishanav et al 2017 another class of luminescent material ce iii based coordination polymer nanoparticles ce cpn were reported to detect as iii ions down to 0 7 ppb it was concluded that the uncoordinated carboxyl groups and para methylthio groups of ce cpns reacted with as iii ions through as s and as o linkage leading to linear fluorescence quenching with increasing as iii ion concentration yang et al 2018a 2 2 3 fluorescence turn on mechanisms sometimes the introduction of as ions significantly enhances the emission signals this mechanism is termed as turn on mechanism dtt functionalized carbon quantum dots cqds take advantage of the s s chemistry to inculcate sh functionalities on the np surface and execute as s chemistry for as v ion detection to attain the detection limit of 0 086 ppb pooja et al 2017 the coating agent of qds plays a crucial role in determining their dispersion state cysteamine was chosen for functionalization because it serves as bifunctional ligand which binds to as iii ions via thiol groups and on the other hand use the hydrophilic amine groups for increasing the solubility of cdte zns core shell qds in water cysteamine passivated cdte zns core shell qds are positively charged and the aptamer is negatively charged which creates the possibility for electrostatic interaction between the amino groups of qds and dna producing neutral charge on the surface of qds this will eventually decrease the repulsion between qds and enhance aggregation leading to fluorescence quenching thus on addition of as iii ions it readily forms as iii aptamer complex leading to de aggregation of qds and enhancement of fluorescent signals the detection limit of this approach is 0 0013 ppb ensafi et al 2016 likewise n ce was co doped on carbon dots cdn ce on addition of as iii ions the aptamer restores the partially quenched blue fluorescence of cdn ce because of electrostatic leading to exponentially enhanced fluorescent signals with increasing as iii ion concentration the detection limit of this sensing mechanism is reported to be 0 2 ppb zhang et al 2019 2 2 4 fluorescence turn off on mechanisms fluorescent probe arsenofluor1 is the pioneer chemo sensor for detection of as iii in organic solvents at 298 k and acts as an active off on fluorescence sensor it is thermo stable in both solid and liquid states when stored in dark chemo selective over toxic ions such as hg2 pb2 and cd2 and can detect down to 0 24 ppb ezeh and harrop 2012 another research group reported the sensing system based on oligonucleotide functionalized cuins2 qds fe3o4 nps composite wherein mpa capped cuins2 qds were covalently bound to the amino terminal of oligonucleotide which show symmetric strong fluorescence emission at 656 nm fe3o4 nps adsorbed on the ssdna cuins2 qds by binding to the phosphate backbone of ssdna turning off the fluorescence addition of as v ions to the ssdna cuins2 qds fe3o4 nps composite would turn on the quenched fluorescence as as v ions are adsorbed on fe3o4 nps this method was reported to have the detection limit of 0 13 nmol 1 fluorescence mediated arsenic detection shows highly sensitive quick and selective response towards arsenic ions introduction of nanomaterial in sensing system has helped in attaining lower limits of detection one of the key reasons must be immobilization of appropriate fluorescent probes on nanomaterials that provides abundant surface area for probe analyte interaction eventually enhancing the intensity of fluorescent signals however unspecific binding of analytes in a complex medium poses a major drawback which necessitates discovery of more efficient fluorescent units and suitable nanomaterials that may be used as efficient sensors another challenge is the insolubility of fluorescent probes and qds in water hence development of water soluble fluorescent chemo nanosensor is still an area less explored 2 3 surface sensing methods 2 3 1 surface enhanced raman spectroscopy optically active nanomaterials like noble metal nanoparticles offer a unique platform in arsenic sensing because of their elevated reactivity high electrical conductivity optical effects and better surface area to volume ratio sers is a surface phenomenon that arises from the local amplification of electric field of a metal surface when conduction band electrons resonate with incident light yogarajah and tsai 2015 electromagnetic enhancement mechanism is the prominent contributor in most of the sers processes this enhancement results in amplification of the light by excitation of lsprs of metal nanoparticles appendix 4 sharma et al 2012 fig 1 highlights the key sers strategies used for heavy metal detection which may be divided into two broad categories based on the source of signal generation a probe based sensing wherein the change in the probe molecule on interaction with target analyte regulates the signal generation b raman reporter tag based sensing employs a raman reporter molecule which is attached to the nanoparticle 2 3 2 hotspot generation upon interaction between probe and analyte increasing the number of hotspots generated at the nano junctions of metal nanostructures can intensify electromagnetic field it is noticed that metal nanoparticle nanoclusters exhibit 7 times enhanced signals than isolated bulk metal when raman reporter molecules are attached to the surface of such metal nanostructures the signals are enhanced largely kneipp et al 2006 tang et al 2018 4 mercaptopyridine 4 mpy and 4 mercaptobenzoic acid 4 mba have been mostly used as raman reporters for as ion detection song et al 2016a in table s4 a comparative analysis of the reported nanomaterials with respect to their surface chemistry and sensing efficacy for arsenic detection based on raman is presented 2 3 2 1 raman reporter tag based sensing previously sers mediated detection of as ions was supported by aggregation of nps however these days more preference if given to morphological variations on sers substrate though in the previous reports gsh has assisted in as ion detection yet it was reported that for sers gsh alone could not produce enough sers signals li et al 2011 thus mpy was tagged along with gsh for modification of silver nanoparticles agnps this led to dramatic aggregation of gsh mpy modified agnps due to as o linkage the aggregated agnps produced several hotspots thus enhancing the raman signals greatly because of elevation in electromagnetic field detecting as iii ions down to 0 76 ppb li et al 2011 entry 1 table s4 in 2008 uniform langmuir blodgett lb monolayers of different sizes and shapes of ag nanocrystals were fabricated octahedral nanocrystal with edge length of 250 300 nm demonstrated the optimum differential analysis of arsenic species polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp was considered as an ideal coating as it could sense arsenite and arsenate represented by a peak at 750 and 800 cm 1 respectively down to 1 ppb mulvihill et al 2008 entry 3 table s4 in 2015 the lack of gold nanostructures for fabrication of sers substrate was realized hao et al 2015 subsequently aunps were integrated into sers substrate to enhance the raman signals and the sensitivity of the detection method via target induced aggregation strategy of 4 mpy modified au agnps which is modulated by a cationic polymer poly diallyldimethylammonium pdda and an ars 3 aptamer when as iii ions are absent ars 3 will hybridize with pdda to form a duplex structure leaving 4 mpy modified au agnps well dispersed in the solution yielding a very weak raman signal wu et al 2012 while in the presence of as iii ions ars 3 aptamer forms an aptamer as iii complex electrosteric charge on the pdda disturbs the charge balance encouraging the 4 mpy modified au agnps to aggregate with linear enhancement of raman signal the reported lod was 59 parts per trillion ppt ng l 1 yang et al 2015 entry 4 table s4 another related report explains au ag core shell nanoparticles with a uniform size of 40 nm tagged with 4 mba could detect as iii ions herein as iii aptamer was adsorbed on au ag by coordination interaction between n atom of base and au ag as iii ions could specifically bind to as iii aptamer to form as iii aptamer complex eventually leading to aggregation of au ag the raman signals were enhanced due to the formation of raman hotspots by 4 mba resulting in the lod of 0 1 ppb song et al 2016b entry 5 table s4 there is a significant trend shift in nanomaterials being used as sers substrate and the underlying reaction mechanism of arsenic sensing previously sers based detection was facilitated simply by aggregation of surface modified agnps or aunps but these days it is supported by goethitic surface chemistry ag dendrites doped with feooh were reported to detect total as iii v as iii is oxidized to as v on feooh doped ag dendrites the surface defects arising due to goethitic surface chemistry enhances the chemical sers signals assisting in detection down to 0 001 ppb pradhan et al 2015 entry 6 table s4 to overcome the concerns linked to the irregular and imprecise spread of au or ag nps on the sers substrate three dimensional silver nanoporous films agnpf were fabricated from 20 30 nm thick ag nanowires agnw which were self organized into a 3 µm thick film comprising even nanochannels and ligaments in the range of 30 50 nm to enhance the sensitivity γfe2o3 was doped on the agnpf leading to as v ions detection down to 1 ppb liu et al 2015 entry 7 table s4 similarly agnps decorated αfe2o3 were used as sers substrate to take advantage of the large surface area and increased loading capacity of agnps eventually forming a hot spot rich hierarchical structure this research gives a novel direction for reproducible and highly sensitive detection of arsenic species in water with the lod of 1 5 ppb bekana et al 2018 entry 8 table s4 in near future research efforts must emphasize on controlled assembly of nps to avoid irreproducibility future developments for sers substrates will likely involve spatial control over analytes within hot spots exploration of different sers active metals and differential analysis of as species 2 3 3 surface plasmon resonance surface plasmon is fundamentally reliant on the morphology of nanomaterial composition of nanomaterial nanomaterial size active surface and surrounding environmental media liu et al 2020 the interaction of light and metals or metallic nanostructures is studied in plasmonics alterations in the refractive index that are related to chemical structure or chemical interaction events contributes in developing an understanding for the presence concentration and identity of the target molecule through plasmonics fig 2 represents the key features of the surface plasmon resonance spr based sensing including class of surface functionalization molecules ligand immobilization methods and analyte detection strategies appendix 5 noble metal nanoparticles are ideal for plasmonic studies due to their high stability larger surface area and excellent size shape dependent optical properties the change in colour of suspension is induced by varying interparticle space or aggregation state kelly et al 2003 between target analyte and plasmonic nanostructures the chemistry of arsenic directs that sulphur and amine groups have strong binding affinity towards as iii and v ions and may be used for chelation kalluri et al 2009 this chelation property has been materialised for developing detection strategies for as iii and as v ions in water by simply functionalizing the nanoparticle surface with suitable thiol or amine group recognition molecules some of the reported recognition molecules that have been used for aunp surface functionalization assisting trace level arsenic detection are lauryl sulphate shrivas et al 2015 and gsh dtt cys pdca domínguez gonzález et al 2014 with an lod ranging from 2 5 ppb to 10 ppt each as iii ion can bind to three dtt conjugated aunps by as s linkage however in gsh and cys there are no available sulphur groups resulting in binding of as iii via as o linkage kalluri et al 2009 surface functionalised gold film with recognition element and a reference area unable to absorb arsenic could support the detection of arsenic down to 1 ppb with gsh sensing probe 3 ppt with dtt probe and 1 ppt with n dithiocarboxy n methyl d glucamine dtgluc probe forzani et al 2007 label free gold nanorods with a length of 72 nm and a diameter of 29 nm were employed for as iii ion sensing based on non aggregation and inhibition of oxidative shortening of au nanorods this strategy is largely reliant on the shape dependent optical properties of the local surface plasmon resonance band of au nanorods in the presence of fe iii the lod of 10 ppb was achieved and the primary focus of this research was to overcome the unnecessary aggregation of aunps producing false signals as well as unspecific reactions that are frequently encountered das et al 2019 poly allylamine hydrochloride pah consists of amine functionalities leading to electrostatic and selective complexation between pah and as v ions this sensing strategy employs single 50 nm pah modified aunp plasmon to negate the ensemble average effects and reduce the probability of irrelevant reactions the limit of detection for this strategy was 10 nm hong et al 2011 incorporating competitive binding of biomaterials such as phytochelatin like peptides ϒ glu cys 3 gly arg pc3r xia et al 2012 ars aptamer with nacl and ctab thao nguyen et al 2018 wu et al 2012 peg 300 glucose boruah et al 2019a boruah et al 2019b au doped carbon dots nanosols zhang et al 2020 and by exploiting the inhibitory effect of as species on bio catalytic activity of acid phosphatase acp zhang et al 2016 assists nanomaterials for enhanced bio sensing of as species modulating the surface topology of the nanomaterials to obtain more adsorption sites for specific receptor probes to attach and consequently offering more reactive sites for as ions attachment is gaining attention for instance a hybrid platform which comprises of amine functionalized radially porous silica particles was employed over a gold thin film these silica particles have radially oriented mesopores whose size increases from the center to outer surface providing large surface area for receptor analyte interaction and lower detection limit of 1 0 nm choi et al 2014 a polypyrrole chitosan cobalt ferrite nanoparticles composite layer was electrodeposited on a gold coated glass slide the thickness of this sensing layer was 66 nm and the selective sensing of as v ions was facilitated by chitosan chitosan serve as the main recognition probe for as v ion sensing through four amino groups in a square planar geometry and the cofe2o4 nanoparticles adsorbed as v ions due to defect induced ferromagnetism in this strategy the combination of surface chemistry and physical property of nanomaterials could detect as v ions down to 1 ppb sadrolhosseini et al 2017 surface plasmon resonance based arsenic sensing has progressed greatly and embraces a great potential in the future of visual quantification research must be focused towards improving the reproducibility of spr sensing by fine tuning and monitoring nanomaterial synthesis process another essential parameter that needs urgent attention is the unspecific interactions between ligands and interferents along with the stability of their binding furthermore chemical functionalization is susceptible to surface saturation and fouling leading to inconsistent responses on higher concentration which must be extensively researched 2 4 electrochemical methods electrochemical sensors using various nano and micro materials that offer novel prospects with benefits such as improved sensitivity and selectivity quick response and cost effectiveness have been established electrochemical techniques are considered reliable and user friendly because they follow reagent less simple and low cost procedures zaib et al 2015 this section will hence summarise the novel electrochemical approaches implemented for detection of as ions based on the cumulative knowledge gaps within electrochemical sensing strategies reported till date the properties of these surface modifications will be evaluated on the basis of the performance of electrode in detection of as ions 2 4 1 selective ligand based arsenic detection ligands play an important role in determining the performance of a particular sensor as ion detection has been facilitated extensively by ligands rich in thiol group the synergistic effect of gsh dtt and n acetyl l cysteine was investigated by fabricating a self assembled layer on the surface of au electrode for as iii detection the three ligands were immobilized on the electrode surface via au s interaction while on the other side of this monolayer hydroxyl or sulfhydryl groups were present for chelation of as iii ions by the virtue of as o or as s linkage these ligands created a three dimensional triple layer hierarchical structure due to distinct chain lengths of the ligand such nanoarchitecture led to abundant binding of as iii moieties on the electrode facilitating facile electron transfer due to close proximity of as iii ions resulting in lod down to 0 5 and 0 3 ppb in controlled matrix and real water sample respectively chen et al 2011 similarly mercaptoethylamine mea was immobilized on au electrode surface to achieve better sensitivity and to overcome the interference from cu ions the electrode surface was functionalized with mea via au s linkage and two carbon alkyl chains with long alkane chains were used to block the conduction of electrons to the electrode surface moreover amine groups possessing positive charge aided in repulsion of cu ii ions away from the au surface due to electrostatic interaction as well as chelates as iii ions through as n interaction offering the lod of 0 2 ppb the proposed electrode detects as iii ions in phosphate buffer at ph 7 0 which shows the potential of this electrode to detect as iii ions in real water samples li et al 2012 similar mechanism was employed for multimodal detection of arsenic using gsh dtt and asparagine modified agnps sensing arsenic down to 0 36 ppb and 5 2 ppt respectively via colorimetry and electrochemistry wen et al 2018 e n 2 nitrobenzylidene benzenesulfonohydrazide nbbsh was assembled on the gce wherein three molecules of nbbsh form a complex with as iii ions via donation of two electrons from each compound this nbbsh nafion modified gce shows best response at ph 7 demonstrating an excellent lod of 50 pm rahman et al 2019 2 4 2 morphology and topology of nanomaterial for arsenic sensing noble metal nanoparticles and exploration into different strategies to develop noble metal hierarchical nanostructures have constantly facilitated the selective and sensitive as ion sensing although high sensitivity and selectivity has been reported using the au and aunps modified electrode yet the major constraints of interference from cu ii ions in natural water high detection potential and interference from supporting electrolyte anions remain unaddressed anodic stripping voltammetric asv detection of as iii ions is mostly challenged by cu ii ion interference either due to increase or decrease in stripping current depending on the cu ii ion concentration hence restricting the design of au based arsenic sensors for analysis of real water samples proposes improved ventures the crystallographic orientation of aunps plays an important role in determining its impact on electrochemical sensing fabrication of self assembled monolayers sams of thiol short chains on au electrodes are an interesting process to attain single crystallographic domain at the polycrystalline gold poly au electrode at the molecular level potential controlled partial desorption of the sam can selectively block domains of poly au surface leaving other domains bare thus au 111 like poly au electrode was fabricated by forming a sub monolayer of n butyl thiol n bt it was observed that the n bt blocks the au 110 and au 100 domains on poly au surface leaving au 111 domain free additionally appropriate lateral interactions between alkane chains were anticipated for compact coverage the reported lod was 0 28 ppb without any cu ii ion interference rahman et al 2010 the micro nano electrode ensembles offer many advantages over macroelectrodes such as decreased resistance from solution low detection limit better signal to noise ratio and increased mass transport ideally it is expected that detection limits of ultra microelectrode ensemble must be much lower than macrosized electrodes because of the ratio of faradic to capacitive current is considerably high at the ensemble an attempt to explore the same was reported using self assemblies of 3 mercaptopropyl trimethoxy silane mpts on poly au electrode which exists as 3 dimensional silicate network with abundance of sh groups yielding a highly sensitive as iii detection down to 0 02 ppb kumar jena and retna raj 2008 stripping techniques also play a crucial role in electrochemical analysis facilitating preconcentration of metal phase onto electrode surface as well as selective oxidation of each metal phase during an anodic potential steep keeping these benefits in view a flow through anodic stripping chronopotentiometric method was developed for fast and simultaneous analysis of both the inorganic as species au wire electrode was employed for as v sensing at a negative potential in acidic conditions with the reported lod of 0 42 ppb for as iii ions and 0 55 ppb for as v ions jedryczko et al 2016 similarly an electroactive nano textured au electrode au gne assemblage demonstrated enhanced electron transfer due to its unique assembly which facilitates better electro oxidation of as iii ion down to 0 08 ppb babar et al 2019 2 4 3 strategies to overcome cu ii ion interference amongst all the interferents of as iii ion detection cu ii presents the most interference on the gold macro electrodes cu ii codeposits with as iii ions during the deposition step to form intermetallic compound cu3as2 though the stripping peak of cu ii is slightly more positive than as iii stripping peak yet when cu ii is present in high concentration it masks the as iii peak dai and compton 2005 a way to overcome this interference was involving ammonia the interference of cu ii was addressed by using the complexation chemistry between nh3 and cu ii ions a cathodic shift was observed on addition of ammonia indicating at the successful complex formation and the ph of the electrolyte shifted from 3 to 9 idris et al 2016 aunps embedded nafion nf composite was synthesized by cu i mediated noble metal reduction briefly cu ii ions were reduced to cu i in cathodic potential scan cu i further accumulated in nf modified layer and serves as movable mediator cu i is chemically re oxidized to cu ii in the presence of aucl4 this electrochemical catalytic process reduces aucl4 to au the chemically restored cu ii was reduced to cu i on the surface of the electrode consequently encouraging the formation of zero valent au in the nafion modified layer continually the nafion aunps composite offers two benefits a highly dense and uniform layer of aunps which aids in sensitive electro analysis of as iii ions and nafion serves as a chemically inert and stable binder which helps in preconcentration of cation and better resistance to interfering ions the as prepared nafion aunps composite on glassy carbon electrode gce has high sensitivity towards as iii ions as the result of large electrochemical surface area offering lod of 0 047 ppb huang and chen 2013 2 4 4 carbon nanomaterials based sensing noble metal free nanoparticles or nanocomposites have gained attention from the scientific community because of their excellent catalytic activities electrical conductivity quick mass and electron transfer and high surface area aragay et al 2011 carbon nanotubes cnts especially multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts were employed for gold electrode surface modification mwcnt are less stable and possess more structural defects compared to single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts thus they are likely to enhance the electron transfer and provide abundant active sites for as iii ions to attach these mwcnts were attached to the electrode surface through sh groups and the exposed side of these cnts possessed sh moieties for targeted as iii ion binding the developed electrode could detect total arsenic as iii as v and as iii ions in natural and high salinity waters profumo et al 2006 aunps modified cnts were immobilized on gce through a simple drop casting and evaporation method the ideology behind aunps coverage on cnts was to enhance surface area and electroactivity of the electrode swv and lsv were performed in an optimized system with deposition time of 120 s with the lod of 0 1 ppb xiao et al 2008 a cost effective solution is to use carbon based materials such as three dimensional porous graphitic carbon nitrides g c3n4 decorated with aunps on a gce which promotes the reduction of as iii ions due to its rich electronic state narrow band gap high adsorption capability and good dispersion capability facilitating aunps with additional active sites and better electrical conductivity bu et al 2020 2 4 5 redox cycle based sensing some reports propose materials to reduce the production cost of nanomaterials to introduce new properties for enhancing the detection iron nanoparticles fenps are integrated with noble metal nps such as pt pd and au to form bimetallic nps which serve as low cost catalysts in optimized conditions an attempt to achieve the same resulted in the development of fept nps which serve as an excellent sensing probe compared to pristine nps the si 100 electrode was modified with fept nps which was reported to detect as iii ions down to 0 8 ppb and overcome the cu ii ion interference because bimetallic nps such as fept possess more d vacancies than pt nps improving the adsorption and oxidation of as species the fept nps modified si electrode shifts the oxidation potential of as 0 to as iii to more positive potential 0 13 v while the oxidation potential of cu 0 to cu ii is shifted to more negative potential 0 3 v moghimi et al 2015 mno2 also plays an important role as an oxidant in the arsenic removal process thus it was deduced that doping mn oxides with fe oxides could provide synergistic effect in arsenic removal and provide better electrochemical reactivity mesoporous mnfe2o4 nanocrystals were immobilized to attain large contact area of the electrode electrolyte interface in electrochemical detection of as iii ions by swasv the limit of detection achieved was 1 95 ppb in optimized conditions zhou et al 2015 another work reported the aunp decorated mesoporous mnfe2o4 nanocrystal clusters the aunps of 13 nm diameter were supported mnfe2o4 nanospheres of 350 nm diameter gce was chosen as the electrode of interest the electrochemical reaction between the 3 aminopropyl trimethoxysilane aptms functionalized mnfe2o4 au hybrid nanospheres modified gce and as iii ions were mediated under 0 1m naac hac ph 5 0 the amine groups of aptms were responsible for sensing as iii ions the lod of proposed sensor was 3 37 ppb zhou et al 2016 metal organic framework mof offers abundant tunable pore size and surface to volume ratios which act as favourable scaffolds for as iii ion sensing kumar et al 2015 usman et al 2020 in an instance the nanostructure of au ultra microelectrodes and fe oxide were used for developing a hybrid nanomaterial pyrolysis treatment was employed for fabricating the stepwise assembly of porous fe oxide based ag au porous nanoshells which were used to modify gce the synergistic properties of both the nanomaterials imparted highly adsorptive and sensitive micro reactive sites which consequently enhance the electrocatalytic properties of the proposed hybrid nanomaterial resulting in as iii ion detection down to 0 01 ppb zhao et al 2018 zinc based mofs demonstrated high adsorption capability when the electronic properties of graphene sheets were combined with the adsorption ability of zn centred mofs to allow for as iii ions detection at trace levels sem images confirmed that the deposition semi spherical of zn mofs on layer like structure expectedly graphene oxide this hybrid nanomaterial modified gce was employed for as iii ion detection by oh substitution of znoh sites for the formation of an inner complex zn o as the lod of 0 06 ppb was obtained by using this nanohybrid material baghayeri et al 2020 poly l lactide stabilized aunps modified screen printed electrode pla aunp spe and stable structures led to the detection of as iii ions down to 0 09 ppb song et al 2006 the active surface area of pt electrode was amplified by immobilization of pd nps in the presence of a surfactant sds it was concluded that maximum redox currents were obtained in the following trend pt pt pd pt pdsds the peak currents were increased by 48 and only 27 in pt pdsds and pt pd electrode respectively it was concluded that the porosity of the catalytic matrix was probably developed upon deposition of pd nps in the presence of sds molecule the lod of 0 2 ppb was attained by pt pdsds electrode the arsenite oxidation occurred in a stepwise mechanism forming a metastable as iv species before finally converting into as v alam et al 2018 2 5 goethitic chemistry based sensing the goethitic chemistry of arsenic has been often used as its detection strategy because fe serves as an excellent adsorbent of as ions yavuz et al 2006 thus the combination of aunps and fe3o4 lead to the development of highly conductive and adsorptive nanomaterial facilitating highly sensitive as iii detection as iii ions first adsorb on the surface of such nanomaterials further released on the surface of electrode for redox reaction fe ii works as electro catalyst since surface activated fe ii donates an electron to form fe iii during the reduction of as iii to as 0 then fe iii gets an electron from the electrode during the oxidation of as 0 to as iii completing the fe ii fe iii cycle the fe ii fe iii cycle and aunps synergistically contribute towards the sensitive electrochemical detection of as iii ions down to 0 0215 ppb li et al 2018a similar research as conducted to highlight the importance of surface defects of co0 6fe2 4o4 nanocubes the combination of co and fe administers enhanced adsorptive capability and catalytic activity since electrochemical detection is a process that is mediated by gain or loss of electrons which can be regulated by cu ii to cu iii and fe ii to fe iii cycle between as iii ions and co0 6fe2 4o4 nanocubes modified glassy carbon plate gcp li et al 2018b related surface chemistry was employed for developing aunps decorated fe3o4 nanospheres covered by room temperature ionic liquid and supported by screen printed electrode the modified electrode was highly sensitive to as iii ions at near neutral ph 5 0 detecting down to 2 2 ppt wei et al 2016 3 integrated technology based sensing recently focus has shifted to miniaturizing the electrochemical detection platform by integrating electrochemistry with microfluidics such systems when integrated will provide sample preparation sensor preconditioning and analysis on a single microfluidic chip modular microfluidics employs different modules which can be easily put together for assisting as iii ion detection on a single microfluidic device wherein first as iii sample is preconditioned for accumulation followed by stripping of the metal ion to produce analytical signals this integrated system was reported to detect as iii ions down to 0 42 ppb giménez gómez et al 2019 the presence of micro nano junctions in the microchannel exhibit different phenomena such as ion depletion ion exclusion and amplified electrokinetic trapping effects electrochemical trapping uses real time feedback based on the position of particle in the system to eliminate the particle s brownian motion in electrokinetic trapping when external electric field is applied ion imbalance amongst micro and nano channels is generated forming a concentration gradient near the interface of micro nanochannels an electronegative membrane is generally placed at the micro nano junctions with preferably cation permeability which is caused by acidic impurities present on the pores of the membrane this technique is termed as ion concentration polarization icp however the key concern met by icp device is the deficiency of quantification analysis for concentrated ions to overcome this limitation radial channels icp device was fabricated and electrodes were attached to this fabricated system for as iii ion detection the lod of 1 ppb was achieved using only 40 µl of sample in such integrated system subramanian et al 2020 the electrochemical detection of as ions have been largely explored and the accomplishments so far have also been rewarding yet electro analysis method with proficient anti interference towards competing ions in the natural water ph is still scarce and critical one of the most vital steps in electrochemical determination of as ions is the deposition time of metals which must be reduced without compromising the capability of arsenic detection alternative inexpensive material based electrodes electrode surface renewal and improved designs to handle surface fouling must be taken into consideration 4 challenges and the potential trend shift in nano enabled arsenic detection we evaluate the different detection methods based on the lods offered by them the most common strategy that is used for as ion detection is the interaction between sh group of selective ligand usually gsh dtt or l cysteine and as ion in the literature colorimetric sensing using this chemistry has reported the lod between 5 25 ppb kalluri et al 2009 spr based sensing reported the lod of 1 ppb forzani et al 2007 sers based sensing reported the lod of 0 76 ppb li et al 2011 and electrochemistry based sensing reported the lod of 0 3 0 5 ppb chen et al 2011 though electrochemical arsenic detection method shows the best sensitivity yet when it comes to point of use sensor lack of field applicability is witnessed on the other hand noble metal plasmonic sensing offers selective sensitive cost effective and field applicable platform for arsenic detection a point of debate might arise when it comes to the cost effectiveness of these noble metal nanoparticles the cost dynamics at laboratory scale might be high however at commercial scale the fabrication cost may be slashed down to half or even lower it has been shown that microfluidics have been integrated with electronics and inkjet technology onto a single lab on a chip the fabrication of this technology costs usd 0 01 esfandyarpour et al 2017 another classic example is the boom in the cnt market over the span of ten years the price of cnts was higher than gold usd 45 g 1 but today it is slashed down to usd 0 1 25 g 1 and usd 50 400 g 1 for mwcnts and swcnts respectively zhang et al 2013 therefore with these advancements the challenges of sensitivity selectivity and affordability might be curbed further advancements in the material chemistry and technology approaches might extend the applicability of these technologies to water deployable field kits 5 conclusions and prospects arsenic in groundwater is a major concern globally and has been testified in numerous regions around the globe till date conventional field kits have been used widely to quantify arsenic in contaminated waters however thorough evaluation and assessment of these kits have raised questions about their selectivity and sensitivity designing ultrasensitive sensors requires lock and key principle to work between the target analyte and recognition probe thus the research has mostly revolved around nanomaterial fabrication and the modulation of surface functionality which is exclusively selective for arsenic ions however the main challenges to overcome are primarily related to the impact that competing ions have on selective analyte detection the translation of the most promising sensors beyond laboratory conditions in controlled matrices is also required and more studies looking at such scale up aspects are dearly needed advanced chemical mechanisms by both experimental and modelling approaches towards improved anti interference strategies shall be further explored with nano engineering to tune predict and control the interactions between arsenic species and nanomaterial surfaces the success of disabling current restrains in strategies will facilitate the prevention and management of highly as contaminated water sources nano enabled sensors have already progressed providing ultrasensitive detection capabilities benefiting from enhanced properties at the nanoscale the smart engineering of the nano enabled sensors from the control of active sites for arsenic ion attachment as well as the miniaturization of the system becomes essential porous materials such as cofs mofs offer promising prospects in arsenic sensing also nanocomposites and multi component nanomaterials consisting dual or triple composite nanostructures are reported to exhibit improved sensitivity and selectivity compared to single nanomaterial amalgamation or hybridization of different nanomaterials must be explored for potentially using such nanostructures for arsenic detection the stability and selectivity of nano enabled sensors may be achieved by controlling the synthesis process surface properties and geometric assembly of nanomaterials lastly the concept of microfluidics offers an excellent platform for developing an ideal nanosensor having integrated multiple techniques on a chip this may possibly negate the cross talks between different ions and support selective and ultra sensitive arsenic detection requiring smartly designed preconcentration and processing units finally there is a need to define the regeneration method of nano enabled arsenic sensing systems which must be considered as advancement towards development of cost effective and environment friendly arsenic sensing technologies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

17394,this review compiles recent advances and challenges in the photocatalytic treatment of natural water by analyzing the remediation of cyanotoxins the review frames the treatment need based on the occurrence geographical distribution and legislation of cyanotoxins in drinking water while highlighting the underestimated global risk of cyanotoxins next the fundamental principles of photocatalytic treatment for remediating cyanotoxins and the complex degradation pathway for the most widespread cyanotoxins are presented the state of the art and recent advances on photocatalytic treatment processes are critically discussed especially the modification strategies involving tio2 and the primary operational conditions that determine the scalability and integration of photocatalytic reactors the relevance of light sources and light delivery strategies are shown with emphasis on novel biomimicry materials design thereafter the seldomly addressed role of water matrix components is thoroughly and critically explored by including natural organic matter and inorganic species to provide future directions in designing highly efficient strategies and scalable reactors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords contaminants of emerging concern persistent organic pollutants advanced oxidation processes photo assisted water treatment 1 introduction blooms of algae in aquatic ecosystems can constitute a critical threat to the ecosystem the environmental implications of excessive algal growth include a decrease in the dissolved oxygen concentration a sequestration of nutrients by algae that reduces their availability to other species and the absorption of sunlight by the blooming algal biomass which reduces light penetration for other species sellner et al 2003 who 2013 from a health perspective a major concern is the formation of harmful algal blooms hab which are characterized by the presence of toxin producing algae that can release toxic compounds in the water anderson 2015 sellner et al 2003 direct consumption of water contaminated by hab has been associated with numerous events of death in pets and livestock animals although fatal exposure to cyanotoxins in human is much more rare direct exposure through recreational activities have been associated with hospitalization due to pneumonia liver damage or hepatic failure bláha et al 2009 there is an increasing amount of literature documenting potential chronic impacts such as gastrointestinal illnesses and cancer in human populations kubickova et al 2019 with the increasing frequency of hab due to climate change and the intensification of agricultural activities anderson 2015 there is an ever increasing need for efficient technologies able to treat cyanotoxins contaminated water cyanotoxins are produced by cyanobacteria photosynthetic prokaryotes as mostly cell bound secondary metabolites that are released into the water after cell death paerl and otten 2013 rastogi et al 2014 common species able to produce cyanotoxins include anabaena microcystis cylindrospermopsis nostoc synechococcus and several others anderson 2015 paerl and otten 2013 however toxin production is not constant in most species and it is reported that between 25 and 75 of hab worldwide are toxin producing bláhová et al 2007 chorus 2001 even within the same location and with blooms formed of the same species the hab may not always be toxin producing dittmann et al 2013 the exact cause why a bloom may or may not be producing toxin is unclear different strains of the same species may lack the gene cluster responsible for toxin production or possess them in an inactive state that prevent the synthesis of toxin dittmann et al 2013 in strains able to produce toxins the intracellular toxin content was found to be modulated by a variety of environmental or physiological factors such as temperature light nutrient availability presence of heavy metals hydrodynamic conditions organic matter cell density and grazing by predators boopathi and ki 2014 merel et al 2013a given the complexity of interactions existing between these different environmental triggers predicting toxic production in hab is still a major challenge cyanotoxins can be classified based on their chemical composition or toxicological interactions in terms of composition cyanotoxins are broadly divided into cyclic peptides e g mycrocystin nodularin alkaloids e g cylindrospermopsin anatoxin saxitoxin and lipopolysaccharides e g endotoxin carmichael 1992 codd et al 1999 ferrão filho and kozlowsky suzuki 2011 however cyanotoxins are produced by a wide variety of species which result in a large diversity of structures even within one toxin type for example there are more than 85 variants of microcystins mcs alone rastogi et al 2014 likewise different cyanotoxins can have different mechanism of action in mammals which lead to a classification of cyanotoxins based on their toxic effects hepatotoxins e g mycrocystin nodularin cylindrospermopsin neurotoxins e g anatoxin saxitoxin or dermatotoxins e g aplysiatoxin lyngbyatoxin a carmichael and boyer 2016 ferrão filho and kozlowsky suzuki 2011 several of these cyanotoxins have also been shown to lead to carcinogenic impacts over time kubickova et al 2019 because of these potential impacts on human health reliable monitoring and treatment tools are critical to avoid deleterious effects of cyanotoxins in drinking water cyanotoxins monitoring can be based on a range of immunological biological or physicochemical approaches and will vary depending on the type of cyanotoxin considered kaushik and balasubramanian 2013 melegari et al 2012 merel et al 2013a perreault et al 2011 the detection of cyanotoxins can be challenging because of the low detection limit of some analytical techniques for cyanotoxins high analytical costs and the co occurrence of multiple cyanotoxins with multiple mechanisms of action which cannot be all detected within the same biological or immunochemical assay al sammak et al 2014 chia et al 2019 merel et al 2013a similar challenges exist for the removal of cyanotoxins in water treatment systems where a mixture of different compounds with dissimilar structure can co exists and can be potentially toxic at low concentrations treatment technologies for cyanotoxins therefore needs to be efficient non specific and able to achieve high removal at low concentrations conventional water treatments including flocculation filtration sedimentation and chlorination generally remove cyanobacteria and low levels of cyano toxins however they are ineffective for completely degrading high levels of cyanotoxins produced during moderate and severe bloom events the inability of these processes to completely degrade cyanotoxins has prompted the development and implementation of advanced oxidation processes aops in general aops are based on the generation of highly active oxidizing species such as hydroxyl and other radicals via radiation oxidation catalysis or a combination of these antoniou et al 2016 chatzitakis et al 2008 zhang et al 2014a during the last 20 years studies on cyanotoxin removal have shown that aops can in general effectively remove cyanotoxins however further research may face important challenges related to economic practical and environmental improvements in order for aops to become a realistic technology for large scale cyanotoxin removal treatment schneider and bláha 2020 although many studies have not offered a holistic view considering economic and environmental aspects such as operational costs and the mineralization rate or toxic byproducts formed during cyanotoxin degradation the degradation efficiency and energy consumption of uv h2o2 uv o3 uv ps uv pms and uv chlorine are highly competitive however electrochemical oxidation radiolysis fenton processes and photocatalysis have also demonstrated strong potential for large scale cyanotoxin removal schneider and bláha 2020 during the last two decades photocatalysis has been established as a useful technology for degrading various cyanotoxins including mcs and cylindrospermopsin cyn under uv visible and solar irradiation antoniou et al 2008a liu et al 2013 pestana et al 2015 the non selective nature of the free radicals produced by aops makes them ideal for addressing the diversity of structures found in cyanotoxins however thus far there have been few reports of photocatalytic technology adoption by water treatment utilities lawton et al 2003 lee et al 2004 mauter et al 2018 which indicate that there are still technical and economic limitations to the use of photocatalysis for cyanotoxin remediation in water treatment even confronted with these challenges the use of photocatalysis in large scale environmental applications is expected to be widespread in the not so distant future as it gains the ability to emerge as an inexpensive sustainable and green technology in this review we present the state of the art related to photocatalytic treatment processes for the removal of cyanotoxins from drinking water from the last 20 years we discuss the current issues related to geographical distribution and legislation of cyanotoxins in drinking water and evaluate the potential of photocatalytic systems to achieve treatment goals for these contaminants the role of the water matrix and the operational conditions are also presented to highlight the current research needs in photocatalytic treatment of cyanotoxins 2 geo localization of cyanotoxin blooms and legislative actions taken 2 1 geo localization and geographical distribution of cyanotoxin blooms whereas the origins of cyanotoxins are certain the conditions that provoke cyanobacteria to produce and release them remain poorly understood in most cases cyanotoxins emerge with the formation of cyanobacterial habs cyanohabs whose growth is sustained if not enhanced in water exceeding 25 c that exhibits high concentrations of nutrients especially phosphorous and nitrogen gkelis and zaoutsos 2014 o neil et al 2012 who 2011 because anthropological activities and eutrophication e g water pollution and globally rising temperatures promote such high temperatures and nutrient concentrations in water they also sustain if not promote the production and release of cyanotoxins at the same time increased precipitation changes in ph levels extended periods of direct sunlight irradiation stable stratification in bodies of water and calm or stagnant water flows among other environmental factors can also increase the growth of cyanohabs christophoridis et al 2018 environmental protection agency 2014 owing to those factors cyanobacterial growth tends to occur more often in dams lakes ponds reservoirs and slow moving rivers during the summer and autumn especially in tropical and subtropical zones even so cyanohabs also grow in bodies of fresh water including in swiss alpine lakes throughout colder regions of the world fig 1 bernard et al 2017 du et al 2019 flores et al 2018 meriluoto et al 2017 although cyanotoxins are often retained in the cytoplasm of cyanobacteria that is as intracellular cyanotoxins in the presence of cyanohabs they can also be easily released when cyanobacteria die or when stress occurs other cyanotoxins including cyn are naturally released by healthy cyanobacteria during the occurrence of cyanohabs in that case as extracellular cyanotoxins both intracellular and extracellular cyanotoxins have to be considered in water treatment processes because their ratio to each other when released during the growth of cyanohabs is practically identical due to stress conditions and the death of cyanobacteria during that dynamic process buratti et al 2017 neilan et al 2013 wert et al 2014 however water treatment can also dramatically increase the release of intracellular cyanotoxins due to cyanobacterial cell lysis in any case the release of cyanotoxins whether intracellular or extracellular may depend more upon environmental conditions and the external manipulation of water bodies than the presence of species able to produce toxins pantelić et al 2013 pinho et al 2015a several circumstances the incomplete understanding of bioactive substances produced by cyanobacteria the increased occurrence of cyanohabs the complexity of cyanotoxins release and the limitations of analytical methods that preclude the rapid simple simultaneous identification of concentrations of cyanotoxins in water explain the absence of a global study to systematically monitor geographical and temporal trends in the distribution of cyanotoxins du et al 2019 flores et al 2018 gkelis and zaoutsos 2014 o neil et al 2012 albeit estimated the global distribution of the six most common cyanotoxins i e microcystins nodularins cyns saxitoxins anatoxins and β n methylamino l alanine appears in fig 1 although governmental and nongovernmental reports about those cyanotoxins are more often released in europe and north america than in asia south america oceania africa and antarctica the map nevertheless shows that eradicating cyanotoxins is very much a global challenge du et al 2019 flores et al 2018 a brief summary of the particularities of each region is presented here europe cyanotoxins are identified in western european regions i e with an oceanic climate characterized by cool summers in far southern european regions i e with a mediterranean climate characterized by hot summers and in central eastern european regions i e with a continental climate also characterized by relatively hot summers in cold regions including the baltic sea region and serbia the production of cyanotoxins intensifies during the summer due to increased water temperatures especially on the water s surface although mcs are the most commonly found cyanotoxins in europe cyns saxitoxins and anatoxins are significantly present as well cyanotoxins are detected predominately in lakes in more than 28 european countries however recent studies have also demonstrated their presence in slow moving rivers cirés et al 2014 du et al 2019 dziga et al 2019 flores et al 2018 kurmayer et al 2011 lopes and vasconcelos 2011 mantzouki et al 2018 meriluoto et al 2017 according to the european environment agency 88 2 of europe s fresh water i e for drinking industry agriculture and recreation comes from rivers and groundwater whereas the rest comes from reservoirs and lakes although cyanotoxins are detected predominantly in lakes and lake water represents only approximately 1 5 of europe s fresh water the potential risks of cyanotoxins cannot be underestimated because a truly global map of toxic cyanobacteria in europe remains unavailable cirés et al 2014 du et al 2019 dziga et al 2019 flores et al 2018 kurmayer et al 2011 lopes and vasconcelos 2011 mantzouki et al 2018 meriluoto et al 2017 central and north america cyanotoxins have been detected in north and central america in inland freshwater lakes and coastal areas especially in the united states and canada the climate of central and north america including rain drenched mountains and drought ridden deserts ranges from tropical to polar all six types of cyanotoxins are identified in central and north america however mcs are clearly the predominant type in the regions followed by a significant presence of anatoxins and a lesser but far from negligible presence of cyn and saxitoxins in the arctic region of north america by contrast mcs and nodularins are the predominant species although cyanotoxins are clearly more intensely present in tropical and subtropical regions to the south importantly significant amounts of mcs cyns and saxitoxins have been detected in more than 30 of lakes and reservoirs in the united states according to the u s environmental protection agency lakes and reservoirs are important sources of surface water for drinking industrial purposes and recreation consequently the widespread occurrence of cyanotoxins in the country s lakes and reservoirs can pose risks to public health awwa 2016 carmichael and boyer 2016 du et al 2019 flores et al 2018 jacoby and kann 2007 loftin et al 2016 wiltsie et al 2018 asia all six types of cyanotoxins have frequently been detected in the lakes ponds and reservoirs in the temperate and tropical coastal areas of asia at the same time a non negligible concentration of cyanotoxins has been found in the inland lakes and rivers of various countries in southern asia as mentioned however a truly global map of the risk of cyanotoxins in asia is impossible due to the limited number of reports and studies the most prevalent climates in asia tropical rainforest hot desert warm humid continental hot summer mediterranean humid subtropical tropical savanna and tropical monsoon climates are ideal for the growth of cyanohabs and in turn for the production of cyanotoxins the most detected cyanotoxins in asia are mcs although significant concentrations of cyns anatoxins nodularins and saxitoxins have also been reported given the region s ideal conditions for the development of cyanohabs even partial data suggest that monitoring and removing cyanotoxins may be pivotal to managing asia s water resources du et al 2019 flores et al 2018 greer et al 2017 liu et al 2011 wilhelm et al 2011 south america up to five common types of cyanotoxins i e mcs nodularins cyn saxitoxins and anatoxins have been detected in several south american countries whereas β n methylamino l alanine is only identified in peru although cyanotoxins are predominantly found in south america s reservoirs they have also been detected in its lakes and rivers the continent s regions are dominated by a warm climate which is most suitable for the growth of cyanohabs whether in tropical or temperate regions despite such excellent conditions for the growth of cyanohabs and the high concentration of cyanotoxins detected in several sources of surface water e g san roque lake cordoba argentina south american countries have issued fewer reports than other countries which makes monitoring the real distribution of cyanotoxins on the continent considerably difficult du et al 2019 flores et al 2018 hoff risseti et al 2013 ruiz et al 2013 vieira et al 2005 oceania all six types of cyanotoxins have been detected frequently in the inland lakes rivers and ponds of eastern and southern australia as well as on surrounding islands such as new zealand as elsewhere in the world the most commonly detected cyanotoxins in oceania are mcs oceania has a number of different climates ranging from desert to tropical rainforest although the most prevalent are oceanic and tropical rainforest climates the continent s hot humid regions result in the growth of cyanohabs du et al 2019 flores et al 2018 however in australia a mainly arid climate major cyanohabs occur under dry and hot conditions thus affecting water stressed areas africa the six most common types of cyanotoxins have also been found in all countries in africa with the exception of ethiopia possibly due to the limitation in analytical methods the most common are mcs which have been detected in inland rivers lakes reservoirs and ponds africa hosts many different climates the most prevalent of which is tropical savanna because such environmental conditions along with high pollution in some water sources promote the growth of cyanohabs cyanotoxins are causing major problems in the lakes and water reservoirs of eastern and southern africa du et al 2019 flores et al 2018 krienitz et al 2013 antarctica despite the cold temperatures of the region mcs nodularins cyn and saxitoxins have been detected in antarctica whereas anatoxins and β n methylamino l alanine have not the detection of cyanotoxins in antarctica especially demonstrates the strong adaptability of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins which can grow even in conditions unfavorable to the growth of cyanohabs which highlights the potential risk of cyanotoxins worldwide du et al 2019 flores et al 2018 although fully depicting the geographical distribution of cyanotoxins around the world is impossible their potential risk can be concluded from their detection on all seven continents the bioactive substances pose a greater potential risk in tropical subtropical and warm areas however the global risk cannot be underestimated because not all cyanotoxins have been discovered and many have been detected in non negligible concentrations even in regions with environmental conditions highly unfavorable to the growth of cyanohabs 2 2 legislative actions taken to face a worldwide challenge cyanotoxin limits in drinking and recreational water bodies are increasingly being subjected to national and international advisories guidelines and regulations although the world health organization who has published a provisional guideline of 1 ppb of mc lr for drinking water no guidelines have been issued for other variants of mcs or other cyanotoxins edition and first 2008 farrer et al 2015 ibelings et al 2014 available toxicological data confirm the potential risks of various cyanotoxins for human health however they are insufficient to establish limits for their concentration in drinking water nevertheless the data have justified health alerts as well as advisories guidelines and regulations for drinking water in countries such as singapore france spain uruguay and czech republic other states such as canada have set upper limits of 1 5 ppb for total mcs whereas australia has established guidelines of 1 3 ppb for total mcs and published health advisories of 1 ppb and 3 ppb for cyns and saxitoxins respectively farrer et al 2015 funari et al 2017 hudnell 2010 ibelings et al 2014 vogiazi et al 2019 in the european union european directives 1998 83 ec and 2013 397eu govern the drinking water legislation of the various member states with the aim to protect human health from the adverse effects of any contamination of water intended for human consumption by ensuring that it is wholesome and clean despite the wide distribution of cyanotoxins in european bodies of water fig 1 the most recent eu decision 2018 840 to update the substances of environmental concern for european union does not specifically address cyanotoxins in the united states there are no established regulations for cyanotoxins although mcs cyn saxitoxins and anatoxin a are included in the candidate contaminant list 4 of the u s environmental protection agency epa in 2015 the epa published a 10 day health advisory for cyn of 0 7 ppb in drinking water for bottle fed infants and preschool children and of 3 ppb for school age children and adults for total microcystins the advisories state a limit of 0 3 ppb in drinking water for bottle fed infants and preschool children and of 1 6 ppb for school age children and adults in addition several states have established internal health advisories or actions applicable for their domains edition and first 2008 farrer et al 2015 hudnell 2010 ibelings et al 2014 in the context of recreational water the who considers current guidelines for cyanotoxins to be inappropriate the who has recommended guidelines and regulations based upon cyanobacterial cell density bio volume and pigment levels all of which directly relate to the concentration of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins based on those criteria in most cases countries apply two or three tier alert levels indicating the potential risk for human health hudnell 2010 who 2006 however to further advance how the cyanotoxins is regulated the development of more precise rapid monitoring and analytical methods is urgently required as is the improvement of available toxicological data that can guide the establishment of more informed regulatory limits for cyanotoxins in drinking water 3 fundamental principles of photocatalytic treatment for cyanotoxins remediation photocatalytic behavior of semiconductor materials was firstly reported by fujishima and honda in 1972 akira fujishima and kenichi honda 1972 the fundamental principle of photocatalysis relies in the photo excitation of an electron ecb from the filled valence band vb to the empty conduction band cb the electron transition to the excited state is induced by the material absorption of photons with energy equal or superior to the band gap energy eg etacheri et al 2015 hoffmann et al 1995 the photo excited ecb leaves a positively charged hole or vacancy at the valence band hvb according to reaction 1 photogenerated species ecb hvb are referred as charge carriers 1 semiconductor h ν e cb h vb both charge carriers can be involved in different charge transfer processes indeed hvb are strong oxidants that can oxidize organic compounds up to their complete mineralization in aqueous media hvb can react with water yielding hydroxyl radical oh following reaction 2 the second strongest oxidant known after fluorine etacheri et al 2015 hoffmann et al 1995 on the other hand photogenerated ecb is a reducing species reaction of ecb with dissolved oxygen can produce the weak oxidant superoxide radical o2 according to reaction 3 note that other ecb scavengers such as h2o2 can enable additional oxidants production from reaction 4 these oxidant species produced on the catalyst surface remain adsorbed or close to the catalyst surface the degradation of pollutants is then dependent of their adsorption and or limited by their mass transfer towards from the photocatalyst surface chong et al 2010 etacheri et al 2015 hoffmann et al 1995 2 h 2 o h vb oh h 3 o 2 e cb o 2 4 h 2 o 2 e cb oh o h photocatalysis is a light driven process that produces oxidant species in situ the kinetics of oxidant generation is causally related to the number of photons delivered to the catalyst surface per second as can be deduced from reaction 1 in this context it is extremely relevant to provide information of the photon fluence or irradiance of any experimental set up failure to report these values will result in technical reports that cannot be benchmarked or compared to other works in literature duta et al 2018 ovhal and thakur 2010 process efficiency is defined by the usage of delivered photons for the reaction of interest or quantum yield light transport to the surface catalyst is one of the relevant elements that can affect overall process efficiency turbidity and competing species in solution may diminish the absorption of photons on the catalyst surface one of the major drivers of photocatalytic efficiency is related to the stability of charge carriers species in excited state i e ecb are unstable and tend to return to the ground state of lower energy recombination reaction 5 is the main drawback for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants such as cyanotoxins gaya and abdullah 2008 hoffmann et al 1995 kisch 2010 5 e cb h vb heat titanium dioxide tio2 has been widely reported as photocatalyst material for cyanotoxins abatement nanosized tio2 is an n type semiconductor with a characteristic eg of 3 0 ev reported for its main crystalline structures anatase rutile and brookite photocatalysis of pure tio2 is therefore conducted with uv light with wavelengths λ 400 nm that corresponds to energies of 3 1 ev anatase is the most photo active due to the higher spatial separation between charge carriers induced by the crystalline structure which results in a prolonged lifetime of ecb hvb however heterojunctions formed between these different tio2 crystalline structures have shown also increased photocatalytic performance dávila jiménez et al 2018 el sheikh et al 2017 han et al 2011 pelaez et al 2012 the spectrum of solar radiation has a small component of uv light 4 0 low uv irradiance from natural sunlight limits the likelihood of high efficiency and performance of pure tio2 photocatalysis to enable visible light photocatalysis tio2 doping has been the most explored strategy even though the eg of tio2 remains almost identical dopants introduce energy levels within tio2 bandgap existence of these intraband levels allows photoexcitation to occur in two transition steps that require two photons of lower energy within visible light spectra use of these visible active materials do not affect dramatically fundamental mechanisms of tio2 photocatalysis el sheikh et al 2017 han et al 2011 pelaez et al 2012 4 large molecules complex degradation pathways description and understanding of mechanisms of oxidation and degradation pathways enlighten the development of treatment strategies to ensure complete inactivation of these recalcitrant cyanotoxins the complexity of the molecular structure of cyanotoxins i e mcs is deemed as the major challenge for the definition of degradation pathways photocatalytic treatment of organics involves the in situ generation of strong oxidants orha et al 2017 spasiano et al 2015 villaluz et al 2019 many research articles have identified the photogenerated hvb and oh as the main species involved in oxidation processes dávila jiménez et al 2018 ohtani 2011 spasiano et al 2015 these oxidant species can completely mineralize organic pollutants through three main kind of reactions i hydroxylation ii dehydrogenation and iii charge transfer processes oturan and aaron 2014 these reactions have been also identified in the degradation pathway of different types of cyanotoxins as described herein hu et al 2017 yang et al 2011 it is well known that oh is a non selective oxidant which leads to a myriad of possible pathways however identification of intermediates by lc ms has been key to identify pieces of this complex puzzle and to elucidate preferential degradation mechanisms of the two major cyanotoxins studied in literature mcs and cyn 4 1 insights into microcystin macrocycles cleavage mcs are cyclic heptapeptides with a similar basic structure that is solely differentiated by the variation of two aminoacids found in the position y and z described in fig 2 this variability leads to at least 85 different mcs that can be naturally found in water sources christoffersen and kaas 2000 lawton et al 2003 the different mcs are named by the single letter abbreviation of these two variable aminoacids for example the most common mc lr is named after the aminoacids leucine l and arginine r in this section the degradation pathways will be described for mc lr as the most representative mc but similar degradation pathways can be associated to other mcs antoniou et al 2008a chen et al 2012 fig 2 summarizes the scission of the adda side chain of mc as initial step for mc mineralization the initial step is defined by the hydroxylation of the double bounds of adda either at the chain position c4 c5 or c6 c7 yielding product 2 and 3 respectively antoniou et al 2008b fan et al 2020 further oxidation of 2 by oh leads to the breakage of the c c bond forming aromatic acid 4 and peptide macrocycle 5 with an aldehyde group at the former c4 position whereas the cleavage at c6 c7 forms ketone 6 and shorter aromatic acid 7 it is important that intermediate 6 can be further oxidized at the carbonyl position of the ketone to form 5 oxidation of this terminal position generates 8 which has been identified as the previous stage to cleavage of peptide bonds of the macrocycle yang et al 2011 note that hydroxylation of the aromatic ring can occur simultaneously hu et al 2017 fig 3 illustrates the opening of the macrocycle by the cleavage of the peptide bonds hydrolysis of the peptide bond is activated by oh addition on the carbonyl group which may occur in different positions chen s group identified preferential cleavage in four positions yielding intermediates 9 12 further scission of peptide bonds results in the accumulation of different oligopeptides such as 13 20 complete mineralization of aminoacids forms inorganic ions from n heteroatoms that are released as ammonia nitrate or n volatiles promoted by oh oxidation triantis et al 2012 the main mechanistic steps described are hydroxylation reactions via substitution addition to double bonds and oxidative bond cleavage these steps are clearly associated to oh mediation in agreement with scavenging experiments that identified this species as main oxidant of mcs antoniou et al 2009 cornish et al 2000 these reactions can lead to different pathways beyond the simplified mechanisms described herein indeed identification of additional by products suggest that cleavage of the peptide macrocycle can occur prior to adda scission coexistence of both pathways must be considered indeed breakage of the peptide macrocycle can be associated to the quick detoxification of mcs via photocatalysis which can be assumed that takes place prior complete mineralization 4 2 insights into cylindrospermopsin breakage cyn degradation can be initiated by hydroxylation of the uracil ring yielding product 2 which is under tautomeric equilibria with 3 both tautomers undergo further hydroxylation at the uracil ring yielding 4 and 5 chen et al 2015 a redox equilibrium exists between 4 and 5 that can be interconverted by charge transfer processes at the catalyst surface alternatively the first cyn degradative step can involve the oxidation of the hydroxylated carbon between the uracil and tricyclic guanidine cycles yielding 6 followed by further hydroxylation to give 7 whereas hydrogen abstraction by oh requires electron rich substrates and it is relatively slow compared to oh addition fotiou et al 2015 subsequent oxidation steps induce the uracil cleavage yielding n species into solution such as ammonia nitrate or n organics i e formamide and tricyclic guanidine derivatives 8 and 9 oxidation of the side chain leads to formation of intermediates 10 12 cleavage of tricyclic guanidine cycle mediated by oh and other oxidants forms 13 which degradation is followed by the release of low molecular weight carboxylic acids and eventually complete mineralization into co2 and inorganic ions sulfate ammonia and nitrate fotiou et al 2015 note that desulfonation reaction mediated by oh addition can take place at any step exemplified in the inset panel of fig 4 toxicity steadily decreases during treatment time but there is residual activity until advanced degrees of samples mineralization chen et al 2015 these results allow inferring that the by products formed during the photocatalytic treatment may have analogous biological activity to the parent compound cyn in contrast to mc complete cleavage of uracil and tricyclic guanidine cycles of cyn must be attained to diminish toxicity 5 photocatalytic degradation of cyanotoxins 5 1 photocatalytic performance complete abatement of cyanotoxins has been attained with photocatalytic treatment with reported kinetic constants ranging from 10 3 min 1 to 10 1 min 1 as summarized in tables 1 3 however experimental data is hard to compare due to the wide differences in experimental conditions that influence removal performance i e ph catalyst dose irradiance lamp source etc that explain such wide variability of orders of magnitude on kinetic constants titania tio2 has been the most extensively investigated photocatalyst among photoactive semiconductor materials for cyanotoxins abatement andersen et al 2014 pestana et al 2015 robertson et al 2012 sharma et al 2012 zhang et al 2014b the wide bandgap of tio2 3 2 ev for anatase 3 0 ev for rutile and 3 2 ev for brookite limits its application to uv light sources el sheikh et al 2017 han et al 2011 pelaez et al 2012 thus extensive research efforts have been devoted to pure tio2 modification to enable visible light natural sunlight photoactivity doping of pure semiconductors can decrease their bandgaps and activate a photocatalytic response within the visible light spectra the semiconductor lattice and the relative atomic size of the dopant define two different classes of doping i interstitial and ii substitutional interstitial doping is generally observed in tio2 lattices i e rutile and anatase when doping with non metal elements such as carbon nitrogen fluoride or sulfur asahi et al 2001 chen and mao 2007 serpone 2006 umebayashi et al 2002 yu et al 2002 for example pelaez et al have reported that tio2 photocatalysts co doped with nitrogen and fluorine nf tio2 exhibited less bandgap energy than commercial p 25 tio2 2 85 vs 3 20 ev pelaez et al 2010 as shown in fig 5 after 180 min of visible light irradiation no mc lr degradation could observed using reference tio2 and p 25 tio2 whereas non negligible degradation was observable under uv irradiation conversely the nf tio2 photocatalyst achieved excellent photocatalytic degradation of mc lr during the irradiation period meanwhile metal dopants of larger atomic radius may replace ti atoms in the lattice such as observed with bismuth or rhodium lv et al 2009 wei et al 2009 wu et al 2009 conversely a different alternative for visible light photoactive catalysts has been the nano engineering of semiconductor semiconductor or metal semiconductor interfaces the use of nanocomposites demonstrates synergistic effects between the different crystalline phases in terms of catalysts photoresponse and stabilization of charge carriers serrà and philippe 2020 wang et al 2014 2013 xiong et al 2018 in other investigations visible light sensitive photocatalysts such as znfe2o4 zno and ag2cro4 based ones have demonstrated success in photocatalysis by allowing the use of artificial visible light for the complete photodegradation of cyanotoxins even when the uv light was filtered nevertheless those strategies have often complicated synthesis that may hinder effective translation chen et al 2012 fan et al 2020 serrà et al 2020b zhang et al 2009 nano decoration of semiconductor with metals and other materials such as graphene oxide go or graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 are also widely explored lv et al 2019 oliveros et al 2021 sampaio et al 2015b tugaoen et al 2017 the individual components of the composite usually remain separate and distinct within the finished photocatalytic material the formation of an interface can modify the space charge region near due to the higher electron affinity of the conductive material i e metal go g c3n4 which makes these materials behave as electron sinks the schottky barrier potential formed at the interface delays the recombination of charge carriers and extends the time of life of ecb and hvb apart from the electron trapping mechanism enabled when considering photocatalyst nano decoration with a conductive material the formation of such interface can in some cases contribute to achieving a pseudo lower band gap that allows for lower excitation energies kochuveedu et al 2013 the high competitiveness of photocatalysis as a remediation technology for cyanotoxin polluted water sources is clearly supported with experimental evidences unfortunately these experiments are hardly benchmarked using comparative conditions nor considering engineering figures of merit future research efforts must consider a baseline of comparison to truly evaluate photocatalyst performance beyond the casuistic abatement of target cyanotoxins in which techno economic evaluation can assist researchers to define the road map for successful technology translation 5 2 role of ph on the photocatalytic performance and removal kinetics the ph of water bodies plays a vital role in the photocatalytic degradation of cyanotoxins due to several physicochemical phenomena governed by ph herein it is discussed the effect of ph on catalyst surface characteristics and its interaction with target pollutants in aqueous environments the surface charge of a semiconductor is attributed to two mechanisms i the amphoteric dissociation of surface moh groups and ii the adsorption of primary hydroxo complexes and other functional groups both mechanisms are governed by the solution s ph henderson 2011 thiel and madey 1987 the ph at which the net surface charge of photocatalysts becomes neutral is called the isoelectric point iep or point of zero charge phpzc the phpzc depends on the intrinsic nature of the semiconductor material being used and its composition gaya and abdullah 2008 haque and muneer 2007 lee et al 2016 mrowetz and selli 2006 for example tio2 based photocatalysts present phpzc of 6 2 whereas zno based materials have a higher phpzc close to 9 0 for metal oxides moh with predominantly oxygen terminated groups the net surface charge of photocatalysts is positive in solutions with ph below phpzc since terminal groups are protonated and positively charged as deduced from eq 6 conversely surface is negatively charged in solution with ph higher than the phpzc since terminal groups are deprotonated according to reaction 7 gaya and abdullah 2008 haque and muneer 2007 lee et al 2016 mrowetz and selli 2006 6 moh h moh 2 ph p h pzc 7 moh mo h ph p h pzc surface charge of photocatalyst nanoparticles generates electrostatic repulsion between them which enhances their stability in slurries at ph close to the phpzc value in which surface is not charged nanoparticles may tend to agglomerate it is observed that suspended particles become larger in diameter due to formation of flocs which minimizes available surface area and photocatalytic efficiency for a given mass of catalyst gaya and abdullah 2008 haque and muneer 2007 lee et al 2016 mrowetz and selli 2006 solution ph has a direct influence on the speciation of cyanotoxins the ratio of the different charged and non charged species is determined by the respective pka values of each cyanotoxin significant differences on pka can be seen in table 4 between the main cyanotoxins i mcs ii cyn and iii anotoxin a antoniou et al 2008a de maagd et al 1999 pinho et al 2015b the interplay between target cyanotoxin speciation and surface charge are instrumental in photocatalysis heterogeneous processes occur at the interface of the catalyst and are governed by the mass transfer of species from towards the catalyst surface as discussed previously the adsorption of cyanotoxins or at least close interaction with the surface is essential to ensure effective degradation fig 6 illustrates the critical impact of ph on the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of mc lr under identical conditions pinho et al 2015b it can be observed that complete abatement is attained in short treatment times at acidic ph i e ph 3 0 but drastically decreases at higher ph conditions under acidic conditions tio2 surface remains positively charged which enable electrostatic attraction of zwitterionic and negatively charged mc lr species noteworthy is the transition zone between acidic ph phpzc in which mc lr degradation is still competitive and occurs within natural ph range when increasing ph above tio2 phpzc of 6 2 a complete transition towards negatively charged surface occur whereas mc lr speciation remains negatively charged antoniou et al 2009 feitz et al 1999 yang et al 2020 under such conditions electrostatic repulsion hinders adsorption and decreases photocatalytic degradation performance these noticeable differences on mc lr degradation in function of ph impelled researches to focus their studies on mcs degradation at acidic ph application of these conditions to treat natural waters ph 5 0 8 0 would require acid addition prior treatment followed by base neutralization prior release of treated effluent however compromise solutions to treat large volumes of natural water may be required when translating technology towards true environmental remediation in the case of cyn the rate of photocatalytic degradation does not usually strongly depend on ph based on the pka of cyn the zwitterionic toxin is the primary specie at ph values lower than 8 8 in this range of ph the electrostatic interaction with tioh2 ph 6 2 and tio ph 6 2 does not govern the photocatalytic performance chen et al 2015 el sheikh et al 2017 pinho et al 2015b zhang et al 2014a for tio2 or tio2 based photocatalysts the optimum conditions are expected to be slightly basic or slightly acid to prevent the photocatalyst agglomeration values of ph higher than 8 8 may be detrimental as both photocatalyst surface and cyanotoxin are negatively charged nevertheless it should also be noted that research on the topic to date has overwhelmingly focused on the degradation of cyn only in relatively acidic conditions it is important to remark that photocatalytic degradation of cyn performance is insensitive to ph variations within the range of natural waters ph 5 0 8 0 cyn photocatalytic treatment can be conducted without requiring ph adjustments for operation meanwhile in the case of anatoxin a the optimum conditions are expected to be neutral and slightly basic ph values ranging from 6 2 to 9 4 due to the stronger adsorption of positively charged cyanotoxins on the negatively charged photo catalyst s surface hence faster degradation 5 3 photocatalyst dosage impacts performance and technology translation photocatalyst dose for optimal operation is a parameter that is thoroughly evaluated in research articles it is obvious that this parameter is directly related to capital expenses in terms of the cost of semiconductor materials kg 1 required for water purification indeed photocatalyst dose impacts competitiveness beyond cost of material gaya and abdullah 2008 lee et al 2016 the performance of heterogeneous processes depends on the availability of catalytic sites and on the total surface area i e higher mass loading however such a simplistic view disregards effects associated to effective light transport excessive catalyst doses can cause undesired effects first high loading of catalysts can increase solution opacity and significantly decrease light penetration depth this effect may induce dead zones where catalyst loading will not be photo activated due light hindering second high mass of catalyst in suspension may induce particle aggregation which diminishes significantly active surface area chatzitakis et al 2008 hayat et al 2011 kositzi et al 2007 mrowetz and selli 2006 experimental observations suggest optimum doses of photocatalysts up to 1 0 g l 1 as summarized in table 1 3 slight differences may be observed in function of cyanotoxins initial concentration and the nature of photocatalyst material tested it is important to remark that such tests are conducted in small volumes of water of few milliliters ca 5 20 ml as summarized in table 1 3 photocatalytic treatment of cyanotoxins would be intended in principle for environmental remediation of lakes and large volumes of water for example the lake leman in switzerland has an estimated volume of 89 km3 while the and the lake michigan in the united states has an even larger volume of 4 918 km3 as a rule of thumb assuming that dosage metrics are independent of the volume of water to be treated and considering a continuous treatment to decontaminate lake water it is clear the huge amount of catalyst that may be required and or the long times required for high treatment volumes these are obviously insane numbers that would raise questions regarding catalyst recovery from lakes after use however providing a big picture on such dimensions allows illustrating the need of designing optimized reactors that reuse semiconductor photocatalysts to solve a problem with a realistic approach 5 4 light source selection and photocatalyst activity one of the fundamental elements in photocatalytic processes is the delivery of photons of energy required for charge carriers generation following reaction 1 even though often overlooked selection of light source impacts photodegradation kinetics and energy requirement pure photocatalysts of tio2 eg 3 20 ev and zno eg 3 37 ev present band gaps photosensitive only in the uv domain ong et al 2018 pelaez et al 2010 pirhashemi et al 2018 hence uv emitting lamps within the range of 270 400 nm such as xe and hg lamps are the most common choice as irradiation source table 5 collects detailed information regarding characteristics of different uv emitting lamps to analyze the viability of the light source related to photocatalytic activity the critical parameters to consider are energy consumption and irradiance on the one hand energy consumption can be translated into the cost associated with photocatalytic treatment energy consumption is tightly related to the wattage of the lamp which readily highlights hg and xe lamps in table 5 as high energy intensive sources engineering figures of merit such as electrical energy per order ee o can provide a comparative magnitude between different lamps although these are rarely reported for photocatalytic treatment of cyanotoxins the ee o magnifies the electric energy requirement to diminish target pollutant concentration i e cyanotoxins one order of magnitude in a unit of volume as calculated from eq 8 for batch or 9 for flow through operation respectively bolton et al 2001 cater et al 2000 8 ee o kw h m 3 orde r 1 p t 1000 v lg c i c f batch 9 ee o kw h m 3 orde r 1 p q lg c i c f flow through where p is the rated power of the lamp in kw t is the time of treatment in h v is the volume in l 1000 is a conversion factor 1000 l m 3 q is the flow rate in m3 h 1 and lg ci cf is the decadic logarithm of the concentration decay in one order of magnitude note that the prior equations can be simplified when assuming pseudo first order decay kinetics as it is defined by lg ci cf 0 4343k1t on the other hand irradiance w m 2 indicates the power of the radiation incident per unit of surface area irradiance also directly relates to photon flux photons m 2 s 1 which influences the kinetics of degradation because photocatalysis is determined by the number of photons absorbed on the photocatalyst s surface another important parameter in selecting the light source is spectral irradiance wm 2μm 1 which corresponds to the irradiance of a surface per unit per wavelength or frequency duran et al 2010 marks and doudrick 2019 valadés pelayo et al 2015 as shown in tables 1 3 most studies are centered on the use of conventional light sources such as hg and xe lamps to irradiate commercial tio2 degussa p 25 however the use of high pressure hg and xe lamps is energetically unsustainable since most of the photons delivered do not have enough energy for photoexcitation fig 7 a unfortunately the spectral irradiance of other conventional light sources such as incandescent fluorescent or halogen lamps which can reduce the energy consumption centers on the visible domain in terms of energy consumption the use of uv driven photocatalysts is neither energy efficient nor economically viable the recent addition of leds to the water treatment toolbox brought alternative non energy intensive light sources into play chen et al 2017 notably leds are mercury free systems providing a safer and more environmentally friendly source of light conventional uv and uv visible lamps typically contain 5 to 210 mg of hg per lamp excellent performance has been reported on the use of leds in the photocatalytic treatment of cyanotoxins for example based on data reported in table 1 using commercial tio2 degussa p 25 ee o of 23 5 kw h m 3 order 1 and 4361 kw h m 3 order 1 was needed when four 1 6 w uv leds and a 100 w hp hg lamp were used respectively in similar experimental conditions the ee o when uv leds were used was approximately 186 times lower these results highlight how leds become more competitive than conventional light sources however challenges remain on how to fully exploit leds while enhancing homogeneous light distribution in larger scale reactors the development of light transport frameworks such as radial emitting optical fibers show promising perspectives for leds photocatalytic treatments lanzarini lopes et al 2019 tugaoen et al 2017 more research on the photocatalytic degradation of cyanotoxins using led technology is required prior to integrating photocatalyst synthesis and photoreactor design prior to the appearance of technologies such as leds photocatalytic research roadmap aimed the use of natural sunlight to reduce operational costs solar irradiation is a free and renewable source of photons nevertheless fig 7 c illustrates the low intensity of uv light in the solar spectra 4 0 the low irradiance of uv cannot substantially activate photocatalytic response in pure semiconductor materials i e tio2 zno to exploit that untapped resource research efforts focused on the development of visible light driven photocatalysis which harness solar energy as environmentally benign strategy to promote photocatalysis application tables 1 3 reports visible light active photocatalysts that can efficiently remove various cyanotoxins including mc lr and cyn by using artificial visible light or even direct sunlight despite of this promising research steps the complexity of using solar light and designing efficient solar photocatalytic reactors cannot be ignored 5 5 biomimicry based designs of photocatalysts for improved light trapping the biomimetism and bioinspiration approach is one of the most promising challenges in materials design and fabrication for the coming years nature is a true school when it comes to developing basic or highly sophisticated materials and systems with improved properties natural structures are already optimized for defined functionalities and can inspire smart design of more effective materials biomimetic materials are artificial human made materials that mimic the characteristics of natural materials beyond bio inspired design biomimetic research also incorporates the principles of circular and green chemistry to enable a more sustainable and cleaner production of artificial materials sanchez et al 2005 serrà et al 2019a wang et al 2015 zan and wu 2016 in the context of photocatalysis biomimetism could play an important role in the coming years for the development of architectures and systems for improved light trapping photocatalyst synthesis and design should be implemented with the intelligence of the sophisticated architectures and strategies of plants algae and photosynthetic bacteria photosynthetic organisms i e plants algae and certain types of bacteria and photocatalysts use light as an energy source however photosynthetic organisms have developed throughout centuries cooperative light harvesting mechanisms for the efficient photon capture of solar radiation qian et al 2019a serrà et al 2020a 2020c 2019b zhou et al 2009 in the context of fixed photocatalysts fractal and flexible architectures have been proved as smart strategies in photocatalyst design as shown in fig 8 a the phototropism mechanism i e self orientation towards the sun throughout the day of the sunflower inspired the design of sunflower like biomimetic omnidirectional trackers this strategy found that the omnidirectional trackers were able to achieve up to 400 solar energy harvesting improvement compared with non phototropism materials at oblique illumination angles qian et al 2019b natural hierarchical architectures such as plants and leaves exhibit excellent multilevel light scattering high electron diffusion length open and accessible porosity high surface to volume ratios and high light absorption independent from the incident light angle therefore mimicking their architecture and surface properties may result in improved light trapping as shown in fig 8 b c the porous morphology of artificial n doped zno photocatalysts inspired in the macro micro and nanoscale architecture of green leaves increases light absorption by 84 131 zhou et al 2009 as shown in fig 8 d fractal and dendritical architectures of zno based photocatalysts mimicking fern leaves can drastically improve light harvesting even at very high angles of incidence serrà et al 2019b 2019a in the context of non fixed photocatalysts algae and photosynthetic bacteria can also play an important role in the development of micro and nano architectured photocatalysts with improved self propulsion mechanisms as shown in fig 8 e the spirulina platensis microalga was used as a biotemplate for the synthesis of magnetic biohybrid based on zno for the efficient integration of solar photocatalytic water decontamination and bioethanol production the microalgae was selected due to its shape which has been demonstrated effective for harvesting light as well as minimizing sedimentation and agglomeration serrà et al 2020a 2020b similarly various shapes and architectures based on aquatic biota can inspire the design of new photocatalysts 6 decrypting water matrix effects on photocatalytic treatment of cyanotoxins cyanotoxins removal in ultrapure water has been a key stepstone to advance the understanding of photocatalytic technologies however the focus on such unrealistic water matrices may result in an overestimation of photocatalysis capabilities based on academic hype loeb et al 2019 evaluation of challenging conditions even when showing unfavorable assessment in comparison to ideal conditions will not preclude technology transfer opportunities conversely realistic water matrix studies contribute to identify honest challenges and barriers to overcome thus becoming essential elements to ensure successful translation to higher technology readiness levels and actual application water sources contaminated with cyanotoxins e g lakes reservoirs slow moving rivers etc are heterogeneous mixtures of solutes and solids in suspension higher concentration of other organics may compete with cyanotoxins for photogenerated oxidants most natural waters contain natural buffers that limit versatility of easy ph modulation to unrealistic optimum ph conditions reported in tables 1 3 such as high acidic ph 3 0 modification of natural conditions may arise as a major hindrance when considering environmental remediation of lakes this section discusses how photocatalytic degradation of cyanotoxins is critically influenced by characteristics of the water matrix including the presence of natural organic matter nom alkalinity and inorganic ions 6 1 critical influence of natural organic matter natural organic matter nom not only derives from the natural breakdown of terrestrial plants allochthonous plants and as byproduct of aquatic biota autochthonous plants but may also result from human activities nom is an extremely complex mixture of organic compounds humic substances polysaccharides amino sugars proteins peptides lipids protein carbohydrates carboxylic acid amino acid and hydrocarbons with varying polarity acidity molecular mass charge density and biodegradability sillanpää et al 2015 yamamura et al 2014 zhang et al 2009 due to its complexity nom is usually categorized according to its polar i e hydrophobic and hydrophilic and acidic i e acidic neutral or alkaline properties of all organic compounds hydrophobic acids frequently described as humic substances are the chief constituents of nom in bodies of water humic substances consist of humic acids ha which are soluble in alkaline and insoluble in acid fulvic acids which are soluble in alkaline and acidic conditions and humins which are insoluble in both of those conditions bhatnagar and sillanpää 2017 sillanpää et al 2015 although ubiquitous nom occurs to varying degrees depending upon the climate geology biodiversity and topography of each of earth s zones as well as varies spatially and temporally in concentration and composition nom appears in great quantities in bodies of water worldwide concentrations of nom typically range from 2 to 10 mg l 1 in drinking water however its concentration is impossible to generalize in natural bodies of water due to the hydrological and biogeochemical processes that determine its formation matilainen et al 2011 2010 metsämuuronen et al 2014 for example in canada s rivers and lakes concentrations ranging from 3 to 16 ppm are typical whereas concentrations of dissolved nom up to 59 mg l 1 have been detected in northern china s lake hulun located in the sparsely populated hulun buir steppe where minimal direct anthropic effects can be expected chen et al 2012 in the photocatalytic decontamination of cyanotoxins nom has to be considered for it can appear in high concentrations in water sources contaminated with cyanotoxins humic substances can act as photosensitizers by the absorption of sunlight 290 nm visible light it has been reported that under irradiation humic acids may generate small amounts of reactive oxygen species i e oh h2o2 etc this photoactivation event happens about 600 times per hour per humic molecule in mid european natural waters during the summer hoigné et al 1989 these natural photolytic effects are very slow and have negligible effects on cyanotoxins removal half lifetime of about 10 h experimentally estimated for mc rr welker and steinberg 1999 photocatalysis in this regard is not comparable to photocatalytic treatment that can degrade mcs in few minutes see table 1 indeed no photolytic degradation was observed by pelaez et al under visible light irradiation in presence of humic and fulvic substances but in absence of catalyst pelaez et al 2011 yang et al recently reported an excellent study on the effect of nom during photocatalytic treatment of mc lr by uv tio2 percentage of removal of mc lr after 15 min decreased from 99 9 in ultrapure water to 89 0 and 74 3 for increasing nom concentrations of 5 and 10 mg l 1 respectively similar trend is observed when comparing the nom effect on the kinetic rate decrease from 0 261 min 1 at 0 0 mg l 1 of nom 0 144 min 1 at 5 0 mg l 1 of nom and 0 113 min 1 at 10 0 mg l 1 of nom these results prove the inhibitory effect of nom that can be associated to different factors such as i oxidants scavenging ii nanoparticles aggregation induced by surface charge neutralization and iii hindering of light transport feitz et al 1999 zhang et al 2014a however the scavenging effect is considered to be the governing factor of the decrease of photocatalytic performance nom can act as scavenger of photogenerated oh which decreases effective degradation of cyanotoxins in solution during photocatalytic treatment fig 9 a shows the excitation emission fluorescence matrix eefm spectroscopy changes during photocatalytic treatment of samples containing 1 mg l 1 of mc lr and 5 mg l 1 of nom eefm is a sensitive and selective technique that process data on nom fractions based on the differences between chromophores of dissolved organic matter the eefm contour plots show a shift on the fluorescence peak λex λem 325 449 nm to shorter wavelengths λex λem 325 431 nm till complete signal disappearance after 30 min of treatment fig 9 b shows the toc decrease of nom during photocatalytic treatment attaining 53 6 mineralization of initial 5 mg l 1 nom the decrease in fluorescence index observed during eefm analysis reflected a decrease in aromaticity during photocatalytic treatment related to the cleavage of aromatic moieties these results suggest that high molecular fraction of nom is degraded to low molecular weight compounds as verified by organic carbon detection chromatography lc ocd speciation of organics in solution illustrated in fig 9 c it can be observed that the most representative nom were humic acids with close to a 60 in content that is drastically reduced to less than 5 0 in remaining nom whereas the content of low molecular weight neutral and acid species increase in relative content all these results demonstrate the scavenging role of nom and identify humic acids as major competitor in the consumption of photogenerated oxidants i e hvb oh yang et al 2020 nom are complex since scavenging effect is also related to the relative content of humic and fulvic acids as well as the solution ph experimental results of pelaez demonstrate that photocatalytic inhibition is higher with fulvic acid than with humic acid at all ph conditions see table 6 pelaez et al 2011 this trend can be explained by the higher adsorption of fulvic acids on tio2 which results in the direct competition with cyanotoxins for active sites and surface generated oxidants for instance tio2 adsorption in dark conditions showed that 5 0 mg l 1 of suwannee river humic acids achieve 30 1 removal at ph 3 0 22 5 removal at ph 5 0 and 16 7 removal at ph 7 0 after 5 h meanwhile higher removals were attained for 5 0 mg l 1 of suwannee river fulvic acids corresponding to 55 1 removal at ph 3 0 32 3 removal at ph 5 0 and 24 1 removal at ph 7 0 after 5 h interestingly lower kinetic removal of cyanotoxins is reported at higher ph despite of the lower adsorption of nom i e humic and fulvic acids pelaez et al suggested that the coordination complex nom tio2 can mediate the electron transfer from the conduction band of tio2 to an appropriate electron acceptor thus enhancing the stability of oxidants pelaez et al 2011 this effect would compensate up to some extent the competitive consumption of oxidants by nom explaining the lower decrease observed on cyanotoxins removal rate at acidic ph whereas the scavenging effect becomes dominant at alkaline ph due to the lower adsorption of nom lower ecb scavenging effect these mechanisms require further research to fully understand the synergistic effect of nom as electron scavenger solution ph modifies electrostatic surface charge of the solid surface of metal oxides as well nom speciation as discussed above surface of photocatalysts can be neutral positively or negatively charged batista et al 2017 tugaoen et al 2017 the transition between the different conditions is defined by the isoelectric point or point of zero charge phpzc in the case of tio2 the phpzc is 6 2 photocatalyst particles suspended in solutions of ph phpzc are positively charged meanwhile in solutions of ph phpzc are negatively charged according to reactions 10 and 11 respectively it has been reported that adsorbed nom can neutralize surface charge of photocatalysts which induce nanoparticles aggregation yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2014a photocatalyst aggregation decreases available catalytic sites and irradiated photocatalyst surface therefore decreasing photocatalytic degradation performance jefferson et al 2016 10 tioh h tio h 2 ph p h pzc 11 tioh ti o h ph p h pzc the third detrimental effect of nom load in water is associated to decrease on photon delivery to the photocatalyst surface due to hindering of light transport from emission source i e solar light lamp led indeed the photocurrent response of semiconductors is directly associated to the number of photons efficiently delivered per second garcia segura et al 2018 fig 10 shows the absorption spectra of suwannee river humic acids and fulvic acids pelaez et al 2010 it can be seen that both typical nom components have high absorption at the uv visible wavelength range 200 nm 400 nm which will result in the absorption of delivered photons absorption of light by solutes diminish the depth of light penetration reducing photocatalyst activation therefore increase in nom concentration can undermine efficient photoexcitation and diminish generation rate of oxidants it has been observed that highly active uv radiation activity may be limited to near surface layer in eutrophied lakes especially during algal blooms and lyses de lange 2000 6 2 scavenging effects and synergies of inorganic species the content of inorganic species in bodies of water derives primarily from the weathering and leaching of rocks and soils however anthropological activities especially industrial ones are responsible for the discharge of a large number of inorganic species including heavy metals nitrate phosphate perchlorate and fluorides those species are currently considered to be critical pollutants when in excess of permissible limits in bodies of water due to their potential devastating effects upon aquatic biota and human health the content of inorganic species is significantly greater in lakes reservoirs ponds and slow moving rivers than in rivers and streams due to the accumulation of suspended sediments caused by the low velocity of the flow of water in natural water na k mg2 cu2 fe3 and ca2 cations and cl no3 so4 2 hco3 co3 2 and hpo4 2 anions are the most often found nakatani et al 2011 nikanorov et al n d the presence of inorganic cations generally exerts few relevant effects upon the photo oxidation of organic pollutants common cations e g na k ca2 and mg2 in bodies of water cannot capture electrons or holes in solutions because they are all in their highest and most stable states of oxidation however insoluble species of divalent cations associated to water hardness may precipitate on catalyst surface producing scaling i e undesirable crystallization of inert salts on catalyst surface chong et al 2015 sontakke et al 2011 inorganic scaling can inhibit reactivity due to blocking of catalytic sites precipitation of inorganic species can be promoted on catalyst surfaces due to localized ph changes due to heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions bhatkhande et al 2002 kudlek et al 2016 however these aspects are seldomly addressed in research works that focus on the evaluation of catalysts in single use other cationic species of anthropogenic origin may be found in water samples such as heavy metals the presence of cr vi and cu ii can result in the photoreduction of these species on the catalyst surface depending on the conditions that phenomenon can synergistically enhance or inhibit the photo oxidation of organic pollutants deposition of metals on catalysts surfaces can generate metal semiconductor interfaces that act as electron sinks which minimizes recombination reaction 5 and stabilizes oxidants generation beydoun et al 2002 zhao et al 2015 however excess of these species can inhibit photocatalytic activity due to poisoning of catalytic sites or even act as recombination center more attention should be given to these uncontrolled effects that are not usually considered in the study of synthetic water matrices in the case of cyanotoxins the presence of cations slightly affects the kinetics of degradation primarily by reducing the adsorption of mc lr on the photocatalyst s surface due to their interaction with negatively charged mc lr molecules antoniou et al 2010 pinho 2014 zhao et al 2015 the most common inorganic anions in bodies of water i e cl and hco3 co3 2 have demonstrated to chemically active species in presence of photocatalysts herein it is further described the different roles and effects that each individual species may play on the photocatalytic degradation of cyanotoxins chloride is a ubiquitous anion found in the environment in a wide range of concentrations ranging between fresh 0 05 brackish 0 05 3 and saline seawater 3 5 chloride ions can be oxidized by hydroxyl radicals as proven by different aops yielding different active chlorine species lu et al 2005 mostafa et al 2018 fundamentals of reaction mechanisms of chloride with oh were described in the 70s from pulse radiolysis studies which involves several equilibria described in reactions 12 14 hasegawa and neta 1978 jayson et al 1973 12 oh c l hoc l k 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 13 hoc l h h 2 o c l k 2 1 0 10 m 1 s 1 14 c l c l c l 2 k 2 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 non radical chlorine species can be formed from the dimerization of cl radical according reaction 15 or through redox reaction 16 of cl2 radical in the case of photocatalysis chloride can be directly oxidized by direct charge transfer processes on the catalyst surface following reaction 17 then chlorine disproportionate yielding hypochlorite by reaction 18 which is in acid base equilibria 19 with hypochlorous acid it is important to remark that chlorine radical can be generated through uv chlorine process when using uv irradiation through reaction 20 and 21 with reported quantum yields above 1 0 the quantum yields of hclo and clo at 254 nm ranged from 1 4 to 1 7 and from 1 1 to 1 4 mol es 1 respectively conversely at 200 350 nm they ranged from 3 3 to 4 1 mol es 1 for hclo and from 1 4 to 2 1 mol es 1 for clo watts et al 2007 watts and linden 2007 thus these reactions are expected to have significant relevance when photocatalytic operational conditions rely on the use of uv lamp sources 15 2 c l c l 2 16 c l 2 c l 2 e 17 2 c l c l 2 2 e 18 c l 2 2 o h cl o c l h 2 o 19 hclo cl o h

neglected despite their lower oxidation capabilities when compared to oh radical e 2 80 v vs she active chlorine species are still strong oxidants that quickly react with organics lei et al 2019 the standard reduction potential of the different active chlorine species involved in above mechanisms can be classified in decreasing order of oxidative power as follows cl e 2 55 v vs she cl2 e 2 13 v vs she hclo e 1 49 v vs she cl2 e 1 36 v vs she clo e 0 89 v vs she the competitive aspect of those oxidants is that they are not limited by mass transfer due to their homogeneous character yang s group demonstrated that the formation of reactive chloride species contributes to attain significant removal of mc lr in a uv chlorine system chuang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al concluded that the reactive chlorine species attack the conjugated dienes in mc lr by reacting selectively with electron donors sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b the participation of reactive chlorine species in the degradation of mc lr during photoelectrocatalytic degradation using tio2 based photocatalysts was also demonstrated fraga et al 2009 shi et al 2005 nevertheless thorough studies on the effect of chloride ion during cyanotoxins photocatalytic degradation have yet to be conducted special attention should be given to possible yield of chlorinated organics and disinfection by products also common in bodies of water are bicarbonate and carbonate the speciation of carbonates in natural waters is defined by their in acid base equilibria according reactions 22 and 23 bicarbonate carbonate and hydroxide ions are the main species responsible for alkalinity in water water alkalinity is a crucial water quality parameter that indicates the buffering capacity of water i e the capacity to resist changes in the ph alkalinity is usually measured in parts per million of the equivalent carbonate ions jefferson et al 2016 olivo alanis et al 2019 bicarbonate and carbonate anions react with hydroxyl ions to form carbonate radicals following reactions 24 and 25 respectively carbonate radicals pose a significantly lower redox potential e 1 78 v vs she than hydroxyl radicals e 2 80 v vs she liu et al 2016 thus these weaker oxidants decrease the overall efficiency of the photocatalytic degradation of cyanotoxins carbonates inhibit the photodegradation of cyanotoxins and other organic compounds due to their strong scavenging activity for hydroxyl radicals figure 11 shows that the initial reaction rate of the degradation of mc lr under a visible light activated tio2 is dramatically affected by the presence of carbonates pelaez et al 2011 first it can be inferred that speciation depending on ph is one of the key aspects of alkalinity inhibition it can be observed that at given concentration of 50 mg l 1 of na2co3 at ph 7 1 the photocatalytic degradation of mc lr was not statistically different from the blank experiments conducted in absence of na2co3 conversely identical concentration of 50 mg l 1 of na2co3 at ph 10 3 resulted in complete inhibition of photocatalytic removal of mc lr this trend is explained by the stronger scavenger activity of carbonate that reacts with oh according 25 with a kinetic constant k 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 two order of magnitude higher than bicarbonate k 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 second the increasing concentration of carbonate bicarbonate ions has a detrimental effect on mc lr degradation kinetics despite the negligible effect observed at ph 7 1 for 50 mg l 1 of na2co3 with a degradation rate of mc lr of 0 54 10 3 μm min 1 inhibition due to oh scavenging was observed at higher na2co3 concentrations thus doubling content of na2co3 to 100 mg l 1 of na2co3 decelerates degradation rate by ca 35 down to 0 34 10 3 μm min 1 further addition of alkalinity reaching 150 mg l 1 of na2co3 slows down degradation rate by 80 to 0 09 10 3 μm min 1 these results agree with the trends observed for other specific scavengers of oh and identify water alkalinity as one of the major hindrances for photocatalytic application in natural waters pelaez et al 2011 22 h 2 c o 3 hc o 3 h p k a 6 4 23 hc o 3 c o 3 2 h p k a 10 2 24 oh hco 3 co 3 h 2 o k 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 25 oh co 3 2 co 3 o h k 3 9 10 9 m 1 s 1 studies have demonstrated that not only ionic strength but also natural organic matter and ph are some of the primary factors governing the surface charge of photocatalysts borgnino 2013 brown et al 1997 hu et al 2010 zareei et al 2019 the stability and aggregation kinetics of photocatalysts have important effects on the adsorption of cyanotoxins and their photocatalytic degradation the dlvo derjaguin landau verwey and overbeek theory is normally used to explain the stability and aggregation behavior of particles in aqueous environments based on this theory the total interaction energy wt is the sum of lifshitz van der waals forces wlw and the electrical double layer interactions wel between particles however other non dlvo forces such as hydration steric effects and hydrophobic forces can also dramatically affect the interaction between particles variations in the ionic strength govern the range of the double layer interaction and contribute to the modification of the particles effective charge schwegmann et al 2013 zareei et al 2019 the debye hückel thickness can be decreased by increasing the ionic strength consequently the electrostatic repulsion weakens increased ionic strength translates to decreased columbic contribution which induces particles aggregation the aggregation of suspended photocatalysts is detrimental for photocatalytic performance since substantially decreases the active surface area available as interface for the photocatalytic reaction with cyanotoxins moreover larger particulates obstruct light transport diminishing the extent photoexcitation reaction 1 the effect of total dissolved solids in water matrices require further attention since it may deviate behavior from ideal conditions in ultrapure water 6 3 treatment of natural water samples senogles et al conducted the first evaluation of photocatalytic treatment performance in natural water samples collected from north pine dam raw water south east queensland australia this natural resource has typical concentrations of 20 μg l 1 of cyn with spikes of concentration reaching levels of 70 μg l 1 due to algal blooms senogles et al 2001 natural and synthetic water samples were treated using tio2 p25 doses of 0 1 g l 1 under uv light irradiation dose 5000 μw s cm 2 reported half lives indicate faster abatement of cyn in real water samples t1 2 4 4 min than in ultrapure water samples t1 2 16 5 min these results were associated to the synergistic role of inorganic species in e g chlorine active species generated from chloride solution as described above which suggest high competitivity of photocatalysis as water treatment technology to minimize the impact of cyanotoxins in raw water sources senogles et al 2001 conversely deleterious effects were observed on the treatment of 1 0 μm cyn spiked in real water samples collected from east fort lake and toledo water plant ohio usa while tio2 treatment under uv irradiation in synthetic water reported kinetic rate constants of cyn abatement of 33 0 10 2 min 1 the kinetic rate dramatically decreased down to 1 9 10 2 min 1 east fort lake 5 1 mg l 1 of toc and 4 59 10 2 min 1 toledo water plant 3 2 mg l 1 of toc the reduction of performance of over 10 fold was ascribed to the scavenging effects of nom and other water matrix components zhang et al 2014a dionysiou s group reported a complete study on the performance of visible active photocatalyst in real water samples natural waters were collected from lake erie ohio usa and st john s river florida usa which have reported increasing episodes of cyanobacterial blooms over the last decade fig 12 depicts the normalized abatement of mc lr by photocatalysis under visible light using a nitrogen and fluorine doped tio2 nf tio2 in different water matrix pelaez et al 2011 dotted lines illustrate removal trends of lab made solutions in ultrapure water i e no matrix effects that show a clear dependence of ph on performance as discussed in previous sections complete abatement of mc lr was attained after 3h of treatment at ph 3 0 while a discrete removal of 15 2 was observed at ph 8 0 this is of high relevance given the natural ph conditions of the water samples of ph 7 0 8 5 see water characteristics in fig 12 null degradation was reported for the visible photocatalytic treatment in real water matrices the low performance can be explained by surface interaction and competitive phenomena involving solutes in natural waters such as the high content of nom ranging between 2 5 9 5 mg l 1 of toc pelaez et al 2011 conversely fig 12 shows that photocatalytic treatment under solar irradiation attains high degree of mc lr degradation due to the contribution of the uv component treatment of lake erie samples and st john s river attained 95 3 and 86 9 removal respectively slight differences can be justified by the higher scavenger character of st john s river water matrix that contained a higher load of nom and alkalinity see table 7 which diminished the degradation ate of mc lr even though the promising premises of sustainable character of visible photocatalysts these cannot achieve cyanotoxins removal in natural water samples this is a critical conclusion that should redefine research efforts towards development of engineering strategies that maximize light delivery and exploitation of uv irradiation for cyanotoxins remediation 7 significance of photocatalytic reactor design for technology translation photocatalysis was proven to be an effective technology for cyanotoxins abatement even in natural water sources research in small batch reactors of 5 ml 20 ml see tables 1 3 was essential to develop i fundamental understanding of photocatalysis capabilities ii degradative pathways elucidation and iii breakthroughs on materials development however research focus at this low technology readiness level may be missing the big picture problem required to address cyanotoxins global challenges see fig 1 translation of photocatalytic technologies should consider treatment of large volumes of water in this frame strategies to tackle the environmental problem of cyanotoxins should distinguish between two points of action that would condition engineering decisions for reactor design and photocatalyst material selection i treatment of lakes or ii detoxification of water sources for drinking purposes at point of entry point of use the value proposition for the treatment of lakes with high concentration of cyanotoxins envisions the use of solar light active photocatalysts which will reduce operational expenses associated to lamp sources jo and tayade 2014 natarajan et al 2011 ye et al 2018 even though the resulting reduction on electrical energy per order ee o requirements is a high promise the deployment of the treatment is still a major engineering challenge the treatment of large volumes of semi stagnant water in lakes by photocatalytic treatment of lakes is an unreachable horizon given the actual state of the art loeb et al 2019 it is obvious that sprinkling lakes with photocatalyst nanoparticles at doses of grams per liter cannot be considered feasible environmental risks and concerns arose from fate and transport of nanoparticles as well as from their sedimentation andy et al 2008 petosa et al 2010 beyond catalyst sedimentation photocatalyst performance can be seriously undermined by limited light transport through lake water bodies safe implementation of nanotechnology for environmental applications may require controlled systems to tackle these engineering challenges friehs et al 2016 haynes et al 2017 wagner et al 2011 passive treatment systems that use supported catalyst have recently appeared as a promising strategy for the case scenario of lakes and reservoirs floating nanocomposite photocatalysts can be deployed and easily recovered reuse after environmental intervention these processes which have been barely explored for cyanotoxins may be an opportunity for the implementation of photo driven cyanotoxins remediation technologies a different case scenario can be observed when detoxification of water sources is desired to ensure access to drinking water photocatalytic detoxification can be implemented to treat collected water in continuous operation mode solar driven treatment can benefit of the use of photoreactors that ensure efficient solar radiation collection and or concentration solar photocatalytic reactors aim to maximize the usage of solar irradiation direct sun irradiation on conventional flat photoreactors results in severe losses of delivered light in this frame alternative reactors maximize light delivery by concentration in tubular reactors this is the case of compound parabolic collectors cpcs that have a light concentration factor close to one i e maximum efficiency concentration is attained by defining reflector geometry to redirect indirect light by reflection into the tubular reactor see fig 13 spasiano et al 2015 engineering design tailoring optimization of light delivery allows i diminishing reactor footprint when compared to commercial flat reactors and ii operation during overcast days due to concentration of indirect sunlight solar driven photocatalysis presents benefits as decentralized treatments that can operate off grid in developing areas however the reactor set ups described above have a great physical foot print moreover the slower kinetic abatement observed for solar light photocatalysis when benchmarked against uv photocatalysis raises some operational questions depending on techno economic considerations it must be more competitive to consider systems that remove cyanotoxins in compact reactors with lower residence times despite of requiring uv light sources reactors that use photocatalysts in slurry require post treatments that separate suspended heterogeneous catalysts after treatment for example commercially available photo cat systems of purifics depicted in fig 13 implements a patented continuous tio2 separation process that allows recapture and reintroduction of catalyst into the inlet stream in a closed loop fluidized bed reactors are continuous flow systems in which a fluid i e the water being treated is circulated at enough velocity to maintain particulate solids in continuous suspension the solid particles remain in constant agitation and swirl around through the fluidized bed avoiding their agglomeration under the so called fluidized state particles in fluidized state behave as they were fluids which improves kinetics of heterogeneous catalytic processes such as photocatalysis fluidized bed slurries keep the photocatalysts particles within the expanded bed of the reactor for their continuous use fang et al 2019 lee et al 2004 rincón and la motta 2019 shet and vidya 2016 in other words catalyst recovery is not required since fluidized particles do not leave the fluidized bed reactor during operation these reactors present wide opportunity of application at short residence times and can be easily modified for simultaneous uv disinfection by defining fluidized bed height see fig 13 the use of films or deposited photocatalysts is an interesting approach that will prevent issues associated to the recovery of nanoparticles even though the required treatment times may be longer than those for slurry systems several works have demonstrated the competitiveness of photocatalytic films on the removal of cyanotoxins antoniou et al 2009 han et al 2011 slower kinetics can be explained by the decrease on available surface area and the noticeable control of the degradation kinetics by mass transfer towards from the photocatalyst surface espíndola et al 2019 han et al 2011 however the development of these static systems provides opportunities for alternative reactor designs alternatives to slurry operation have been explored using catalytic converters as packed bed reactors the major issue of packed bed reactors is associated to photon transport and the possible shadowing effect of surrounding substrates in packed bed or monolith reactors which may diminish the irradiated surface pinho et al demonstrated that transparent monoliths can outperform conventional supports e g glass spheres silica polyvinylchloride supports etc the high performance of these honeycomb three dimensional transparent arrays it attributable to the large specific photoactive surface area that can be efficiently irradiated pinho et al 2015b this can be explained by the reduced shadowing effect as can be deduced from transmittance characteristics of supports illustrated in fig 14 these engineering approaches define possible pathways for supported photocatalysts reactor design that ensure light transport and mass transfer another issue observed in deposited photocatalysts systems is the loss of photocatalytic performance due to the charge carriers recombination however the use of heterogeneous supported systems provides a unique framework that may enable photoelectrocatalytic treatments garcia segura and brillas 2017 the application of a small bias potential can enhance the separation between the charge carriers due to the existence of an external electrical field which avoids or at least slows down the recombination reaction rate cerrón calle et al 2019 it has been observed that photoelectrocatalytic systems can have enhanced performance of film semiconductors when degrading cyanotoxins liao et al 2013 zhao et al 2019 previous systems use energy intensive lamps i e mercury lamps advances in uv light emitting diodes leds have increased light output energy efficiency durability and cost competitiveness chen et al 2017 integration of leds can drastically reduce physical footprint of photocatalytic reactors and their electrical energy requirements few attempts to implement leds have faced light delivery as a major engineering challenge hou and ku 2013 natarajan et al 2011 o neal tugaoen et al 2018a light transport can be improved with photocatalyst coated optical fibers that homogeneously distribute light along the coating as illustrated in fig 15 pure optical fibers transport light occurs via internal reflection with negligible refraction losses when fibers are coated with photocatalysts of refractive index n 2 higher than the characteristic value of the optical fiber n 1 refraction events can deliver light to photoexcite the photocatalyst i e tio2 since light is delivered through the fiber at the internal interface of the catalyst light losses by absorption of solutes and scattering by solids in suspension are avoided which increases efficient use of photons despite of all the interesting approaches discussed in this section photocatalytic treatment of cyanotoxins in water samples at reactor scale has been barely studied benchmarking and techno economic analyses have not yet been conducted therefore engineering decision factors have not yet been defined scaling up and reactor testing can be highlighted as an essential element of the research roadmap to bridge promising lab scale advances with the need of proofs of concept at higher technology readiness level this can be a niche opportunity for photocatalytic systems translation to markets 8 conclusions and key insights on challenges and perspectives worldwide cyanotoxins are recognized as hazardous emerging pollutants in water due to their widespread distribution and occurrence even so due to the limited analytical capabilities the environmental challenge posed by cyanotoxins may be more difficult than it seems worse still conventional water treatment technologies have proven ineffective in removing all cyanotoxins simultaneously as a solution photocatalysis has emerged as promising alternative that has shown exceptional effectiveness in removing intra and extracellular cyanotoxins in addition fundamental studies have elucidated some intricate degradation pathways of cyanotoxins i e mc lr and cyn and demonstrated the complete abatement of parent compounds as well as their toxicity reliance on the use of semiconductor photocatalysts with wide band gaps i e tio2 with eg 3 0 ev require uv irradiation sources because conventional uv light lamps e g mercury lamps and xenon lamps are energy intensive researchers have sought to develop doping strategies that can enable photocatalytic response under visible light and solar irradiation however the ongoing development of led technology could change the paradigm by offering a more cost effective competitive source of light in the same direction relevant advances have indicated that the research roadmap should shift focus from developing materials to implementing technology at higher levels of readiness although doping and using nano composite photocatalysts are interesting approaches to that end neither strategy has advanced the implementation of photocatalytic treatment as expected instead efficient light transport and the improvement of light sources have had the most relevant impact in the field as a result the innovation of material is envisioned to derive from principles of biomimicry as a means to enhance selectivity and light transport developing materials that emulate natural structures of photosynthetic organisms e g plants and bacteria could revolutionize the efficient use of delivered photons initial hype about photocatalytic treatment was based on outstanding performance under unrealistic lab settings that allowed treating small volumes of water with highly energy intensive lamps major challenges were identified in real water matrices in which degradation kinetics had decelerated due to the presence of scavengers and competing species gauging the effectiveness of photocatalysts thus needs to occur to more realistic environments and consider the influence of natural organic matter and inorganic species further research to improve even optimize the photocatalyst performance in complex environments and in large volumes as well as mimicking natural water in real world environments is also urgently needed understanding the effects of water matrices can aid in strategizing novel materials or at least identifying niche applications of photocatalytic processes beyond that the greatest barrier to translating technology is the lack of any reactor design that can completely exploit photocatalysis in the treatment of large volumes of water e g lakes and reservoirs polluted with cyanotoxins optimized treatment conditions for small volumes in batch reactors are mostly unrealistic and inapplicable when considering the true scale of the environmental challenge thus it identifies the development of engineering designed reactors and treatment strategies to be truly competitive alternatives in that sense reactor design and techno economic evaluation are truly major hurdles in translating the results of research into practice research efforts should be directly toward configuring benchmark reactors and comparing passive treatment systems with active ones to fully exploit promising photocatalytic treatments for cyanotoxins remediation finally the development of new low cost doped wavelength targeted catalysts are significant advances that could make photocatalytic oxidation more competitive and cost effective this is a feature that can be fully exploited with led lights as cheap and energy

17394,this review compiles recent advances and challenges in the photocatalytic treatment of natural water by analyzing the remediation of cyanotoxins the review frames the treatment need based on the occurrence geographical distribution and legislation of cyanotoxins in drinking water while highlighting the underestimated global risk of cyanotoxins next the fundamental principles of photocatalytic treatment for remediating cyanotoxins and the complex degradation pathway for the most widespread cyanotoxins are presented the state of the art and recent advances on photocatalytic treatment processes are critically discussed especially the modification strategies involving tio2 and the primary operational conditions that determine the scalability and integration of photocatalytic reactors the relevance of light sources and light delivery strategies are shown with emphasis on novel biomimicry materials design thereafter the seldomly addressed role of water matrix components is thoroughly and critically explored by including natural organic matter and inorganic species to provide future directions in designing highly efficient strategies and scalable reactors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords contaminants of emerging concern persistent organic pollutants advanced oxidation processes photo assisted water treatment 1 introduction blooms of algae in aquatic ecosystems can constitute a critical threat to the ecosystem the environmental implications of excessive algal growth include a decrease in the dissolved oxygen concentration a sequestration of nutrients by algae that reduces their availability to other species and the absorption of sunlight by the blooming algal biomass which reduces light penetration for other species sellner et al 2003 who 2013 from a health perspective a major concern is the formation of harmful algal blooms hab which are characterized by the presence of toxin producing algae that can release toxic compounds in the water anderson 2015 sellner et al 2003 direct consumption of water contaminated by hab has been associated with numerous events of death in pets and livestock animals although fatal exposure to cyanotoxins in human is much more rare direct exposure through recreational activities have been associated with hospitalization due to pneumonia liver damage or hepatic failure bláha et al 2009 there is an increasing amount of literature documenting potential chronic impacts such as gastrointestinal illnesses and cancer in human populations kubickova et al 2019 with the increasing frequency of hab due to climate change and the intensification of agricultural activities anderson 2015 there is an ever increasing need for efficient technologies able to treat cyanotoxins contaminated water cyanotoxins are produced by cyanobacteria photosynthetic prokaryotes as mostly cell bound secondary metabolites that are released into the water after cell death paerl and otten 2013 rastogi et al 2014 common species able to produce cyanotoxins include anabaena microcystis cylindrospermopsis nostoc synechococcus and several others anderson 2015 paerl and otten 2013 however toxin production is not constant in most species and it is reported that between 25 and 75 of hab worldwide are toxin producing bláhová et al 2007 chorus 2001 even within the same location and with blooms formed of the same species the hab may not always be toxin producing dittmann et al 2013 the exact cause why a bloom may or may not be producing toxin is unclear different strains of the same species may lack the gene cluster responsible for toxin production or possess them in an inactive state that prevent the synthesis of toxin dittmann et al 2013 in strains able to produce toxins the intracellular toxin content was found to be modulated by a variety of environmental or physiological factors such as temperature light nutrient availability presence of heavy metals hydrodynamic conditions organic matter cell density and grazing by predators boopathi and ki 2014 merel et al 2013a given the complexity of interactions existing between these different environmental triggers predicting toxic production in hab is still a major challenge cyanotoxins can be classified based on their chemical composition or toxicological interactions in terms of composition cyanotoxins are broadly divided into cyclic peptides e g mycrocystin nodularin alkaloids e g cylindrospermopsin anatoxin saxitoxin and lipopolysaccharides e g endotoxin carmichael 1992 codd et al 1999 ferrão filho and kozlowsky suzuki 2011 however cyanotoxins are produced by a wide variety of species which result in a large diversity of structures even within one toxin type for example there are more than 85 variants of microcystins mcs alone rastogi et al 2014 likewise different cyanotoxins can have different mechanism of action in mammals which lead to a classification of cyanotoxins based on their toxic effects hepatotoxins e g mycrocystin nodularin cylindrospermopsin neurotoxins e g anatoxin saxitoxin or dermatotoxins e g aplysiatoxin lyngbyatoxin a carmichael and boyer 2016 ferrão filho and kozlowsky suzuki 2011 several of these cyanotoxins have also been shown to lead to carcinogenic impacts over time kubickova et al 2019 because of these potential impacts on human health reliable monitoring and treatment tools are critical to avoid deleterious effects of cyanotoxins in drinking water cyanotoxins monitoring can be based on a range of immunological biological or physicochemical approaches and will vary depending on the type of cyanotoxin considered kaushik and balasubramanian 2013 melegari et al 2012 merel et al 2013a perreault et al 2011 the detection of cyanotoxins can be challenging because of the low detection limit of some analytical techniques for cyanotoxins high analytical costs and the co occurrence of multiple cyanotoxins with multiple mechanisms of action which cannot be all detected within the same biological or immunochemical assay al sammak et al 2014 chia et al 2019 merel et al 2013a similar challenges exist for the removal of cyanotoxins in water treatment systems where a mixture of different compounds with dissimilar structure can co exists and can be potentially toxic at low concentrations treatment technologies for cyanotoxins therefore needs to be efficient non specific and able to achieve high removal at low concentrations conventional water treatments including flocculation filtration sedimentation and chlorination generally remove cyanobacteria and low levels of cyano toxins however they are ineffective for completely degrading high levels of cyanotoxins produced during moderate and severe bloom events the inability of these processes to completely degrade cyanotoxins has prompted the development and implementation of advanced oxidation processes aops in general aops are based on the generation of highly active oxidizing species such as hydroxyl and other radicals via radiation oxidation catalysis or a combination of these antoniou et al 2016 chatzitakis et al 2008 zhang et al 2014a during the last 20 years studies on cyanotoxin removal have shown that aops can in general effectively remove cyanotoxins however further research may face important challenges related to economic practical and environmental improvements in order for aops to become a realistic technology for large scale cyanotoxin removal treatment schneider and bláha 2020 although many studies have not offered a holistic view considering economic and environmental aspects such as operational costs and the mineralization rate or toxic byproducts formed during cyanotoxin degradation the degradation efficiency and energy consumption of uv h2o2 uv o3 uv ps uv pms and uv chlorine are highly competitive however electrochemical oxidation radiolysis fenton processes and photocatalysis have also demonstrated strong potential for large scale cyanotoxin removal schneider and bláha 2020 during the last two decades photocatalysis has been established as a useful technology for degrading various cyanotoxins including mcs and cylindrospermopsin cyn under uv visible and solar irradiation antoniou et al 2008a liu et al 2013 pestana et al 2015 the non selective nature of the free radicals produced by aops makes them ideal for addressing the diversity of structures found in cyanotoxins however thus far there have been few reports of photocatalytic technology adoption by water treatment utilities lawton et al 2003 lee et al 2004 mauter et al 2018 which indicate that there are still technical and economic limitations to the use of photocatalysis for cyanotoxin remediation in water treatment even confronted with these challenges the use of photocatalysis in large scale environmental applications is expected to be widespread in the not so distant future as it gains the ability to emerge as an inexpensive sustainable and green technology in this review we present the state of the art related to photocatalytic treatment processes for the removal of cyanotoxins from drinking water from the last 20 years we discuss the current issues related to geographical distribution and legislation of cyanotoxins in drinking water and evaluate the potential of photocatalytic systems to achieve treatment goals for these contaminants the role of the water matrix and the operational conditions are also presented to highlight the current research needs in photocatalytic treatment of cyanotoxins 2 geo localization of cyanotoxin blooms and legislative actions taken 2 1 geo localization and geographical distribution of cyanotoxin blooms whereas the origins of cyanotoxins are certain the conditions that provoke cyanobacteria to produce and release them remain poorly understood in most cases cyanotoxins emerge with the formation of cyanobacterial habs cyanohabs whose growth is sustained if not enhanced in water exceeding 25 c that exhibits high concentrations of nutrients especially phosphorous and nitrogen gkelis and zaoutsos 2014 o neil et al 2012 who 2011 because anthropological activities and eutrophication e g water pollution and globally rising temperatures promote such high temperatures and nutrient concentrations in water they also sustain if not promote the production and release of cyanotoxins at the same time increased precipitation changes in ph levels extended periods of direct sunlight irradiation stable stratification in bodies of water and calm or stagnant water flows among other environmental factors can also increase the growth of cyanohabs christophoridis et al 2018 environmental protection agency 2014 owing to those factors cyanobacterial growth tends to occur more often in dams lakes ponds reservoirs and slow moving rivers during the summer and autumn especially in tropical and subtropical zones even so cyanohabs also grow in bodies of fresh water including in swiss alpine lakes throughout colder regions of the world fig 1 bernard et al 2017 du et al 2019 flores et al 2018 meriluoto et al 2017 although cyanotoxins are often retained in the cytoplasm of cyanobacteria that is as intracellular cyanotoxins in the presence of cyanohabs they can also be easily released when cyanobacteria die or when stress occurs other cyanotoxins including cyn are naturally released by healthy cyanobacteria during the occurrence of cyanohabs in that case as extracellular cyanotoxins both intracellular and extracellular cyanotoxins have to be considered in water treatment processes because their ratio to each other when released during the growth of cyanohabs is practically identical due to stress conditions and the death of cyanobacteria during that dynamic process buratti et al 2017 neilan et al 2013 wert et al 2014 however water treatment can also dramatically increase the release of intracellular cyanotoxins due to cyanobacterial cell lysis in any case the release of cyanotoxins whether intracellular or extracellular may depend more upon environmental conditions and the external manipulation of water bodies than the presence of species able to produce toxins pantelić et al 2013 pinho et al 2015a several circumstances the incomplete understanding of bioactive substances produced by cyanobacteria the increased occurrence of cyanohabs the complexity of cyanotoxins release and the limitations of analytical methods that preclude the rapid simple simultaneous identification of concentrations of cyanotoxins in water explain the absence of a global study to systematically monitor geographical and temporal trends in the distribution of cyanotoxins du et al 2019 flores et al 2018 gkelis and zaoutsos 2014 o neil et al 2012 albeit estimated the global distribution of the six most common cyanotoxins i e microcystins nodularins cyns saxitoxins anatoxins and β n methylamino l alanine appears in fig 1 although governmental and nongovernmental reports about those cyanotoxins are more often released in europe and north america than in asia south america oceania africa and antarctica the map nevertheless shows that eradicating cyanotoxins is very much a global challenge du et al 2019 flores et al 2018 a brief summary of the particularities of each region is presented here europe cyanotoxins are identified in western european regions i e with an oceanic climate characterized by cool summers in far southern european regions i e with a mediterranean climate characterized by hot summers and in central eastern european regions i e with a continental climate also characterized by relatively hot summers in cold regions including the baltic sea region and serbia the production of cyanotoxins intensifies during the summer due to increased water temperatures especially on the water s surface although mcs are the most commonly found cyanotoxins in europe cyns saxitoxins and anatoxins are significantly present as well cyanotoxins are detected predominately in lakes in more than 28 european countries however recent studies have also demonstrated their presence in slow moving rivers cirés et al 2014 du et al 2019 dziga et al 2019 flores et al 2018 kurmayer et al 2011 lopes and vasconcelos 2011 mantzouki et al 2018 meriluoto et al 2017 according to the european environment agency 88 2 of europe s fresh water i e for drinking industry agriculture and recreation comes from rivers and groundwater whereas the rest comes from reservoirs and lakes although cyanotoxins are detected predominantly in lakes and lake water represents only approximately 1 5 of europe s fresh water the potential risks of cyanotoxins cannot be underestimated because a truly global map of toxic cyanobacteria in europe remains unavailable cirés et al 2014 du et al 2019 dziga et al 2019 flores et al 2018 kurmayer et al 2011 lopes and vasconcelos 2011 mantzouki et al 2018 meriluoto et al 2017 central and north america cyanotoxins have been detected in north and central america in inland freshwater lakes and coastal areas especially in the united states and canada the climate of central and north america including rain drenched mountains and drought ridden deserts ranges from tropical to polar all six types of cyanotoxins are identified in central and north america however mcs are clearly the predominant type in the regions followed by a significant presence of anatoxins and a lesser but far from negligible presence of cyn and saxitoxins in the arctic region of north america by contrast mcs and nodularins are the predominant species although cyanotoxins are clearly more intensely present in tropical and subtropical regions to the south importantly significant amounts of mcs cyns and saxitoxins have been detected in more than 30 of lakes and reservoirs in the united states according to the u s environmental protection agency lakes and reservoirs are important sources of surface water for drinking industrial purposes and recreation consequently the widespread occurrence of cyanotoxins in the country s lakes and reservoirs can pose risks to public health awwa 2016 carmichael and boyer 2016 du et al 2019 flores et al 2018 jacoby and kann 2007 loftin et al 2016 wiltsie et al 2018 asia all six types of cyanotoxins have frequently been detected in the lakes ponds and reservoirs in the temperate and tropical coastal areas of asia at the same time a non negligible concentration of cyanotoxins has been found in the inland lakes and rivers of various countries in southern asia as mentioned however a truly global map of the risk of cyanotoxins in asia is impossible due to the limited number of reports and studies the most prevalent climates in asia tropical rainforest hot desert warm humid continental hot summer mediterranean humid subtropical tropical savanna and tropical monsoon climates are ideal for the growth of cyanohabs and in turn for the production of cyanotoxins the most detected cyanotoxins in asia are mcs although significant concentrations of cyns anatoxins nodularins and saxitoxins have also been reported given the region s ideal conditions for the development of cyanohabs even partial data suggest that monitoring and removing cyanotoxins may be pivotal to managing asia s water resources du et al 2019 flores et al 2018 greer et al 2017 liu et al 2011 wilhelm et al 2011 south america up to five common types of cyanotoxins i e mcs nodularins cyn saxitoxins and anatoxins have been detected in several south american countries whereas β n methylamino l alanine is only identified in peru although cyanotoxins are predominantly found in south america s reservoirs they have also been detected in its lakes and rivers the continent s regions are dominated by a warm climate which is most suitable for the growth of cyanohabs whether in tropical or temperate regions despite such excellent conditions for the growth of cyanohabs and the high concentration of cyanotoxins detected in several sources of surface water e g san roque lake cordoba argentina south american countries have issued fewer reports than other countries which makes monitoring the real distribution of cyanotoxins on the continent considerably difficult du et al 2019 flores et al 2018 hoff risseti et al 2013 ruiz et al 2013 vieira et al 2005 oceania all six types of cyanotoxins have been detected frequently in the inland lakes rivers and ponds of eastern and southern australia as well as on surrounding islands such as new zealand as elsewhere in the world the most commonly detected cyanotoxins in oceania are mcs oceania has a number of different climates ranging from desert to tropical rainforest although the most prevalent are oceanic and tropical rainforest climates the continent s hot humid regions result in the growth of cyanohabs du et al 2019 flores et al 2018 however in australia a mainly arid climate major cyanohabs occur under dry and hot conditions thus affecting water stressed areas africa the six most common types of cyanotoxins have also been found in all countries in africa with the exception of ethiopia possibly due to the limitation in analytical methods the most common are mcs which have been detected in inland rivers lakes reservoirs and ponds africa hosts many different climates the most prevalent of which is tropical savanna because such environmental conditions along with high pollution in some water sources promote the growth of cyanohabs cyanotoxins are causing major problems in the lakes and water reservoirs of eastern and southern africa du et al 2019 flores et al 2018 krienitz et al 2013 antarctica despite the cold temperatures of the region mcs nodularins cyn and saxitoxins have been detected in antarctica whereas anatoxins and β n methylamino l alanine have not the detection of cyanotoxins in antarctica especially demonstrates the strong adaptability of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins which can grow even in conditions unfavorable to the growth of cyanohabs which highlights the potential risk of cyanotoxins worldwide du et al 2019 flores et al 2018 although fully depicting the geographical distribution of cyanotoxins around the world is impossible their potential risk can be concluded from their detection on all seven continents the bioactive substances pose a greater potential risk in tropical subtropical and warm areas however the global risk cannot be underestimated because not all cyanotoxins have been discovered and many have been detected in non negligible concentrations even in regions with environmental conditions highly unfavorable to the growth of cyanohabs 2 2 legislative actions taken to face a worldwide challenge cyanotoxin limits in drinking and recreational water bodies are increasingly being subjected to national and international advisories guidelines and regulations although the world health organization who has published a provisional guideline of 1 ppb of mc lr for drinking water no guidelines have been issued for other variants of mcs or other cyanotoxins edition and first 2008 farrer et al 2015 ibelings et al 2014 available toxicological data confirm the potential risks of various cyanotoxins for human health however they are insufficient to establish limits for their concentration in drinking water nevertheless the data have justified health alerts as well as advisories guidelines and regulations for drinking water in countries such as singapore france spain uruguay and czech republic other states such as canada have set upper limits of 1 5 ppb for total mcs whereas australia has established guidelines of 1 3 ppb for total mcs and published health advisories of 1 ppb and 3 ppb for cyns and saxitoxins respectively farrer et al 2015 funari et al 2017 hudnell 2010 ibelings et al 2014 vogiazi et al 2019 in the european union european directives 1998 83 ec and 2013 397eu govern the drinking water legislation of the various member states with the aim to protect human health from the adverse effects of any contamination of water intended for human consumption by ensuring that it is wholesome and clean despite the wide distribution of cyanotoxins in european bodies of water fig 1 the most recent eu decision 2018 840 to update the substances of environmental concern for european union does not specifically address cyanotoxins in the united states there are no established regulations for cyanotoxins although mcs cyn saxitoxins and anatoxin a are included in the candidate contaminant list 4 of the u s environmental protection agency epa in 2015 the epa published a 10 day health advisory for cyn of 0 7 ppb in drinking water for bottle fed infants and preschool children and of 3 ppb for school age children and adults for total microcystins the advisories state a limit of 0 3 ppb in drinking water for bottle fed infants and preschool children and of 1 6 ppb for school age children and adults in addition several states have established internal health advisories or actions applicable for their domains edition and first 2008 farrer et al 2015 hudnell 2010 ibelings et al 2014 in the context of recreational water the who considers current guidelines for cyanotoxins to be inappropriate the who has recommended guidelines and regulations based upon cyanobacterial cell density bio volume and pigment levels all of which directly relate to the concentration of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins based on those criteria in most cases countries apply two or three tier alert levels indicating the potential risk for human health hudnell 2010 who 2006 however to further advance how the cyanotoxins is regulated the development of more precise rapid monitoring and analytical methods is urgently required as is the improvement of available toxicological data that can guide the establishment of more informed regulatory limits for cyanotoxins in drinking water 3 fundamental principles of photocatalytic treatment for cyanotoxins remediation photocatalytic behavior of semiconductor materials was firstly reported by fujishima and honda in 1972 akira fujishima and kenichi honda 1972 the fundamental principle of photocatalysis relies in the photo excitation of an electron ecb from the filled valence band vb to the empty conduction band cb the electron transition to the excited state is induced by the material absorption of photons with energy equal or superior to the band gap energy eg etacheri et al 2015 hoffmann et al 1995 the photo excited ecb leaves a positively charged hole or vacancy at the valence band hvb according to reaction 1 photogenerated species ecb hvb are referred as charge carriers 1 semiconductor h ν e cb h vb both charge carriers can be involved in different charge transfer processes indeed hvb are strong oxidants that can oxidize organic compounds up to their complete mineralization in aqueous media hvb can react with water yielding hydroxyl radical oh following reaction 2 the second strongest oxidant known after fluorine etacheri et al 2015 hoffmann et al 1995 on the other hand photogenerated ecb is a reducing species reaction of ecb with dissolved oxygen can produce the weak oxidant superoxide radical o2 according to reaction 3 note that other ecb scavengers such as h2o2 can enable additional oxidants production from reaction 4 these oxidant species produced on the catalyst surface remain adsorbed or close to the catalyst surface the degradation of pollutants is then dependent of their adsorption and or limited by their mass transfer towards from the photocatalyst surface chong et al 2010 etacheri et al 2015 hoffmann et al 1995 2 h 2 o h vb oh h 3 o 2 e cb o 2 4 h 2 o 2 e cb oh o h photocatalysis is a light driven process that produces oxidant species in situ the kinetics of oxidant generation is causally related to the number of photons delivered to the catalyst surface per second as can be deduced from reaction 1 in this context it is extremely relevant to provide information of the photon fluence or irradiance of any experimental set up failure to report these values will result in technical reports that cannot be benchmarked or compared to other works in literature duta et al 2018 ovhal and thakur 2010 process efficiency is defined by the usage of delivered photons for the reaction of interest or quantum yield light transport to the surface catalyst is one of the relevant elements that can affect overall process efficiency turbidity and competing species in solution may diminish the absorption of photons on the catalyst surface one of the major drivers of photocatalytic efficiency is related to the stability of charge carriers species in excited state i e ecb are unstable and tend to return to the ground state of lower energy recombination reaction 5 is the main drawback for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants such as cyanotoxins gaya and abdullah 2008 hoffmann et al 1995 kisch 2010 5 e cb h vb heat titanium dioxide tio2 has been widely reported as photocatalyst material for cyanotoxins abatement nanosized tio2 is an n type semiconductor with a characteristic eg of 3 0 ev reported for its main crystalline structures anatase rutile and brookite photocatalysis of pure tio2 is therefore conducted with uv light with wavelengths λ 400 nm that corresponds to energies of 3 1 ev anatase is the most photo active due to the higher spatial separation between charge carriers induced by the crystalline structure which results in a prolonged lifetime of ecb hvb however heterojunctions formed between these different tio2 crystalline structures have shown also increased photocatalytic performance dávila jiménez et al 2018 el sheikh et al 2017 han et al 2011 pelaez et al 2012 the spectrum of solar radiation has a small component of uv light 4 0 low uv irradiance from natural sunlight limits the likelihood of high efficiency and performance of pure tio2 photocatalysis to enable visible light photocatalysis tio2 doping has been the most explored strategy even though the eg of tio2 remains almost identical dopants introduce energy levels within tio2 bandgap existence of these intraband levels allows photoexcitation to occur in two transition steps that require two photons of lower energy within visible light spectra use of these visible active materials do not affect dramatically fundamental mechanisms of tio2 photocatalysis el sheikh et al 2017 han et al 2011 pelaez et al 2012 4 large molecules complex degradation pathways description and understanding of mechanisms of oxidation and degradation pathways enlighten the development of treatment strategies to ensure complete inactivation of these recalcitrant cyanotoxins the complexity of the molecular structure of cyanotoxins i e mcs is deemed as the major challenge for the definition of degradation pathways photocatalytic treatment of organics involves the in situ generation of strong oxidants orha et al 2017 spasiano et al 2015 villaluz et al 2019 many research articles have identified the photogenerated hvb and oh as the main species involved in oxidation processes dávila jiménez et al 2018 ohtani 2011 spasiano et al 2015 these oxidant species can completely mineralize organic pollutants through three main kind of reactions i hydroxylation ii dehydrogenation and iii charge transfer processes oturan and aaron 2014 these reactions have been also identified in the degradation pathway of different types of cyanotoxins as described herein hu et al 2017 yang et al 2011 it is well known that oh is a non selective oxidant which leads to a myriad of possible pathways however identification of intermediates by lc ms has been key to identify pieces of this complex puzzle and to elucidate preferential degradation mechanisms of the two major cyanotoxins studied in literature mcs and cyn 4 1 insights into microcystin macrocycles cleavage mcs are cyclic heptapeptides with a similar basic structure that is solely differentiated by the variation of two aminoacids found in the position y and z described in fig 2 this variability leads to at least 85 different mcs that can be naturally found in water sources christoffersen and kaas 2000 lawton et al 2003 the different mcs are named by the single letter abbreviation of these two variable aminoacids for example the most common mc lr is named after the aminoacids leucine l and arginine r in this section the degradation pathways will be described for mc lr as the most representative mc but similar degradation pathways can be associated to other mcs antoniou et al 2008a chen et al 2012 fig 2 summarizes the scission of the adda side chain of mc as initial step for mc mineralization the initial step is defined by the hydroxylation of the double bounds of adda either at the chain position c4 c5 or c6 c7 yielding product 2 and 3 respectively antoniou et al 2008b fan et al 2020 further oxidation of 2 by oh leads to the breakage of the c c bond forming aromatic acid 4 and peptide macrocycle 5 with an aldehyde group at the former c4 position whereas the cleavage at c6 c7 forms ketone 6 and shorter aromatic acid 7 it is important that intermediate 6 can be further oxidized at the carbonyl position of the ketone to form 5 oxidation of this terminal position generates 8 which has been identified as the previous stage to cleavage of peptide bonds of the macrocycle yang et al 2011 note that hydroxylation of the aromatic ring can occur simultaneously hu et al 2017 fig 3 illustrates the opening of the macrocycle by the cleavage of the peptide bonds hydrolysis of the peptide bond is activated by oh addition on the carbonyl group which may occur in different positions chen s group identified preferential cleavage in four positions yielding intermediates 9 12 further scission of peptide bonds results in the accumulation of different oligopeptides such as 13 20 complete mineralization of aminoacids forms inorganic ions from n heteroatoms that are released as ammonia nitrate or n volatiles promoted by oh oxidation triantis et al 2012 the main mechanistic steps described are hydroxylation reactions via substitution addition to double bonds and oxidative bond cleavage these steps are clearly associated to oh mediation in agreement with scavenging experiments that identified this species as main oxidant of mcs antoniou et al 2009 cornish et al 2000 these reactions can lead to different pathways beyond the simplified mechanisms described herein indeed identification of additional by products suggest that cleavage of the peptide macrocycle can occur prior to adda scission coexistence of both pathways must be considered indeed breakage of the peptide macrocycle can be associated to the quick detoxification of mcs via photocatalysis which can be assumed that takes place prior complete mineralization 4 2 insights into cylindrospermopsin breakage cyn degradation can be initiated by hydroxylation of the uracil ring yielding product 2 which is under tautomeric equilibria with 3 both tautomers undergo further hydroxylation at the uracil ring yielding 4 and 5 chen et al 2015 a redox equilibrium exists between 4 and 5 that can be interconverted by charge transfer processes at the catalyst surface alternatively the first cyn degradative step can involve the oxidation of the hydroxylated carbon between the uracil and tricyclic guanidine cycles yielding 6 followed by further hydroxylation to give 7 whereas hydrogen abstraction by oh requires electron rich substrates and it is relatively slow compared to oh addition fotiou et al 2015 subsequent oxidation steps induce the uracil cleavage yielding n species into solution such as ammonia nitrate or n organics i e formamide and tricyclic guanidine derivatives 8 and 9 oxidation of the side chain leads to formation of intermediates 10 12 cleavage of tricyclic guanidine cycle mediated by oh and other oxidants forms 13 which degradation is followed by the release of low molecular weight carboxylic acids and eventually complete mineralization into co2 and inorganic ions sulfate ammonia and nitrate fotiou et al 2015 note that desulfonation reaction mediated by oh addition can take place at any step exemplified in the inset panel of fig 4 toxicity steadily decreases during treatment time but there is residual activity until advanced degrees of samples mineralization chen et al 2015 these results allow inferring that the by products formed during the photocatalytic treatment may have analogous biological activity to the parent compound cyn in contrast to mc complete cleavage of uracil and tricyclic guanidine cycles of cyn must be attained to diminish toxicity 5 photocatalytic degradation of cyanotoxins 5 1 photocatalytic performance complete abatement of cyanotoxins has been attained with photocatalytic treatment with reported kinetic constants ranging from 10 3 min 1 to 10 1 min 1 as summarized in tables 1 3 however experimental data is hard to compare due to the wide differences in experimental conditions that influence removal performance i e ph catalyst dose irradiance lamp source etc that explain such wide variability of orders of magnitude on kinetic constants titania tio2 has been the most extensively investigated photocatalyst among photoactive semiconductor materials for cyanotoxins abatement andersen et al 2014 pestana et al 2015 robertson et al 2012 sharma et al 2012 zhang et al 2014b the wide bandgap of tio2 3 2 ev for anatase 3 0 ev for rutile and 3 2 ev for brookite limits its application to uv light sources el sheikh et al 2017 han et al 2011 pelaez et al 2012 thus extensive research efforts have been devoted to pure tio2 modification to enable visible light natural sunlight photoactivity doping of pure semiconductors can decrease their bandgaps and activate a photocatalytic response within the visible light spectra the semiconductor lattice and the relative atomic size of the dopant define two different classes of doping i interstitial and ii substitutional interstitial doping is generally observed in tio2 lattices i e rutile and anatase when doping with non metal elements such as carbon nitrogen fluoride or sulfur asahi et al 2001 chen and mao 2007 serpone 2006 umebayashi et al 2002 yu et al 2002 for example pelaez et al have reported that tio2 photocatalysts co doped with nitrogen and fluorine nf tio2 exhibited less bandgap energy than commercial p 25 tio2 2 85 vs 3 20 ev pelaez et al 2010 as shown in fig 5 after 180 min of visible light irradiation no mc lr degradation could observed using reference tio2 and p 25 tio2 whereas non negligible degradation was observable under uv irradiation conversely the nf tio2 photocatalyst achieved excellent photocatalytic degradation of mc lr during the irradiation period meanwhile metal dopants of larger atomic radius may replace ti atoms in the lattice such as observed with bismuth or rhodium lv et al 2009 wei et al 2009 wu et al 2009 conversely a different alternative for visible light photoactive catalysts has been the nano engineering of semiconductor semiconductor or metal semiconductor interfaces the use of nanocomposites demonstrates synergistic effects between the different crystalline phases in terms of catalysts photoresponse and stabilization of charge carriers serrà and philippe 2020 wang et al 2014 2013 xiong et al 2018 in other investigations visible light sensitive photocatalysts such as znfe2o4 zno and ag2cro4 based ones have demonstrated success in photocatalysis by allowing the use of artificial visible light for the complete photodegradation of cyanotoxins even when the uv light was filtered nevertheless those strategies have often complicated synthesis that may hinder effective translation chen et al 2012 fan et al 2020 serrà et al 2020b zhang et al 2009 nano decoration of semiconductor with metals and other materials such as graphene oxide go or graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 are also widely explored lv et al 2019 oliveros et al 2021 sampaio et al 2015b tugaoen et al 2017 the individual components of the composite usually remain separate and distinct within the finished photocatalytic material the formation of an interface can modify the space charge region near due to the higher electron affinity of the conductive material i e metal go g c3n4 which makes these materials behave as electron sinks the schottky barrier potential formed at the interface delays the recombination of charge carriers and extends the time of life of ecb and hvb apart from the electron trapping mechanism enabled when considering photocatalyst nano decoration with a conductive material the formation of such interface can in some cases contribute to achieving a pseudo lower band gap that allows for lower excitation energies kochuveedu et al 2013 the high competitiveness of photocatalysis as a remediation technology for cyanotoxin polluted water sources is clearly supported with experimental evidences unfortunately these experiments are hardly benchmarked using comparative conditions nor considering engineering figures of merit future research efforts must consider a baseline of comparison to truly evaluate photocatalyst performance beyond the casuistic abatement of target cyanotoxins in which techno economic evaluation can assist researchers to define the road map for successful technology translation 5 2 role of ph on the photocatalytic performance and removal kinetics the ph of water bodies plays a vital role in the photocatalytic degradation of cyanotoxins due to several physicochemical phenomena governed by ph herein it is discussed the effect of ph on catalyst surface characteristics and its interaction with target pollutants in aqueous environments the surface charge of a semiconductor is attributed to two mechanisms i the amphoteric dissociation of surface moh groups and ii the adsorption of primary hydroxo complexes and other functional groups both mechanisms are governed by the solution s ph henderson 2011 thiel and madey 1987 the ph at which the net surface charge of photocatalysts becomes neutral is called the isoelectric point iep or point of zero charge phpzc the phpzc depends on the intrinsic nature of the semiconductor material being used and its composition gaya and abdullah 2008 haque and muneer 2007 lee et al 2016 mrowetz and selli 2006 for example tio2 based photocatalysts present phpzc of 6 2 whereas zno based materials have a higher phpzc close to 9 0 for metal oxides moh with predominantly oxygen terminated groups the net surface charge of photocatalysts is positive in solutions with ph below phpzc since terminal groups are protonated and positively charged as deduced from eq 6 conversely surface is negatively charged in solution with ph higher than the phpzc since terminal groups are deprotonated according to reaction 7 gaya and abdullah 2008 haque and muneer 2007 lee et al 2016 mrowetz and selli 2006 6 moh h moh 2 ph p h pzc 7 moh mo h ph p h pzc surface charge of photocatalyst nanoparticles generates electrostatic repulsion between them which enhances their stability in slurries at ph close to the phpzc value in which surface is not charged nanoparticles may tend to agglomerate it is observed that suspended particles become larger in diameter due to formation of flocs which minimizes available surface area and photocatalytic efficiency for a given mass of catalyst gaya and abdullah 2008 haque and muneer 2007 lee et al 2016 mrowetz and selli 2006 solution ph has a direct influence on the speciation of cyanotoxins the ratio of the different charged and non charged species is determined by the respective pka values of each cyanotoxin significant differences on pka can be seen in table 4 between the main cyanotoxins i mcs ii cyn and iii anotoxin a antoniou et al 2008a de maagd et al 1999 pinho et al 2015b the interplay between target cyanotoxin speciation and surface charge are instrumental in photocatalysis heterogeneous processes occur at the interface of the catalyst and are governed by the mass transfer of species from towards the catalyst surface as discussed previously the adsorption of cyanotoxins or at least close interaction with the surface is essential to ensure effective degradation fig 6 illustrates the critical impact of ph on the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of mc lr under identical conditions pinho et al 2015b it can be observed that complete abatement is attained in short treatment times at acidic ph i e ph 3 0 but drastically decreases at higher ph conditions under acidic conditions tio2 surface remains positively charged which enable electrostatic attraction of zwitterionic and negatively charged mc lr species noteworthy is the transition zone between acidic ph phpzc in which mc lr degradation is still competitive and occurs within natural ph range when increasing ph above tio2 phpzc of 6 2 a complete transition towards negatively charged surface occur whereas mc lr speciation remains negatively charged antoniou et al 2009 feitz et al 1999 yang et al 2020 under such conditions electrostatic repulsion hinders adsorption and decreases photocatalytic degradation performance these noticeable differences on mc lr degradation in function of ph impelled researches to focus their studies on mcs degradation at acidic ph application of these conditions to treat natural waters ph 5 0 8 0 would require acid addition prior treatment followed by base neutralization prior release of treated effluent however compromise solutions to treat large volumes of natural water may be required when translating technology towards true environmental remediation in the case of cyn the rate of photocatalytic degradation does not usually strongly depend on ph based on the pka of cyn the zwitterionic toxin is the primary specie at ph values lower than 8 8 in this range of ph the electrostatic interaction with tioh2 ph 6 2 and tio ph 6 2 does not govern the photocatalytic performance chen et al 2015 el sheikh et al 2017 pinho et al 2015b zhang et al 2014a for tio2 or tio2 based photocatalysts the optimum conditions are expected to be slightly basic or slightly acid to prevent the photocatalyst agglomeration values of ph higher than 8 8 may be detrimental as both photocatalyst surface and cyanotoxin are negatively charged nevertheless it should also be noted that research on the topic to date has overwhelmingly focused on the degradation of cyn only in relatively acidic conditions it is important to remark that photocatalytic degradation of cyn performance is insensitive to ph variations within the range of natural waters ph 5 0 8 0 cyn photocatalytic treatment can be conducted without requiring ph adjustments for operation meanwhile in the case of anatoxin a the optimum conditions are expected to be neutral and slightly basic ph values ranging from 6 2 to 9 4 due to the stronger adsorption of positively charged cyanotoxins on the negatively charged photo catalyst s surface hence faster degradation 5 3 photocatalyst dosage impacts performance and technology translation photocatalyst dose for optimal operation is a parameter that is thoroughly evaluated in research articles it is obvious that this parameter is directly related to capital expenses in terms of the cost of semiconductor materials kg 1 required for water purification indeed photocatalyst dose impacts competitiveness beyond cost of material gaya and abdullah 2008 lee et al 2016 the performance of heterogeneous processes depends on the availability of catalytic sites and on the total surface area i e higher mass loading however such a simplistic view disregards effects associated to effective light transport excessive catalyst doses can cause undesired effects first high loading of catalysts can increase solution opacity and significantly decrease light penetration depth this effect may induce dead zones where catalyst loading will not be photo activated due light hindering second high mass of catalyst in suspension may induce particle aggregation which diminishes significantly active surface area chatzitakis et al 2008 hayat et al 2011 kositzi et al 2007 mrowetz and selli 2006 experimental observations suggest optimum doses of photocatalysts up to 1 0 g l 1 as summarized in table 1 3 slight differences may be observed in function of cyanotoxins initial concentration and the nature of photocatalyst material tested it is important to remark that such tests are conducted in small volumes of water of few milliliters ca 5 20 ml as summarized in table 1 3 photocatalytic treatment of cyanotoxins would be intended in principle for environmental remediation of lakes and large volumes of water for example the lake leman in switzerland has an estimated volume of 89 km3 while the and the lake michigan in the united states has an even larger volume of 4 918 km3 as a rule of thumb assuming that dosage metrics are independent of the volume of water to be treated and considering a continuous treatment to decontaminate lake water it is clear the huge amount of catalyst that may be required and or the long times required for high treatment volumes these are obviously insane numbers that would raise questions regarding catalyst recovery from lakes after use however providing a big picture on such dimensions allows illustrating the need of designing optimized reactors that reuse semiconductor photocatalysts to solve a problem with a realistic approach 5 4 light source selection and photocatalyst activity one of the fundamental elements in photocatalytic processes is the delivery of photons of energy required for charge carriers generation following reaction 1 even though often overlooked selection of light source impacts photodegradation kinetics and energy requirement pure photocatalysts of tio2 eg 3 20 ev and zno eg 3 37 ev present band gaps photosensitive only in the uv domain ong et al 2018 pelaez et al 2010 pirhashemi et al 2018 hence uv emitting lamps within the range of 270 400 nm such as xe and hg lamps are the most common choice as irradiation source table 5 collects detailed information regarding characteristics of different uv emitting lamps to analyze the viability of the light source related to photocatalytic activity the critical parameters to consider are energy consumption and irradiance on the one hand energy consumption can be translated into the cost associated with photocatalytic treatment energy consumption is tightly related to the wattage of the lamp which readily highlights hg and xe lamps in table 5 as high energy intensive sources engineering figures of merit such as electrical energy per order ee o can provide a comparative magnitude between different lamps although these are rarely reported for photocatalytic treatment of cyanotoxins the ee o magnifies the electric energy requirement to diminish target pollutant concentration i e cyanotoxins one order of magnitude in a unit of volume as calculated from eq 8 for batch or 9 for flow through operation respectively bolton et al 2001 cater et al 2000 8 ee o kw h m 3 orde r 1 p t 1000 v lg c i c f batch 9 ee o kw h m 3 orde r 1 p q lg c i c f flow through where p is the rated power of the lamp in kw t is the time of treatment in h v is the volume in l 1000 is a conversion factor 1000 l m 3 q is the flow rate in m3 h 1 and lg ci cf is the decadic logarithm of the concentration decay in one order of magnitude note that the prior equations can be simplified when assuming pseudo first order decay kinetics as it is defined by lg ci cf 0 4343k1t on the other hand irradiance w m 2 indicates the power of the radiation incident per unit of surface area irradiance also directly relates to photon flux photons m 2 s 1 which influences the kinetics of degradation because photocatalysis is determined by the number of photons absorbed on the photocatalyst s surface another important parameter in selecting the light source is spectral irradiance wm 2μm 1 which corresponds to the irradiance of a surface per unit per wavelength or frequency duran et al 2010 marks and doudrick 2019 valadés pelayo et al 2015 as shown in tables 1 3 most studies are centered on the use of conventional light sources such as hg and xe lamps to irradiate commercial tio2 degussa p 25 however the use of high pressure hg and xe lamps is energetically unsustainable since most of the photons delivered do not have enough energy for photoexcitation fig 7 a unfortunately the spectral irradiance of other conventional light sources such as incandescent fluorescent or halogen lamps which can reduce the energy consumption centers on the visible domain in terms of energy consumption the use of uv driven photocatalysts is neither energy efficient nor economically viable the recent addition of leds to the water treatment toolbox brought alternative non energy intensive light sources into play chen et al 2017 notably leds are mercury free systems providing a safer and more environmentally friendly source of light conventional uv and uv visible lamps typically contain 5 to 210 mg of hg per lamp excellent performance has been reported on the use of leds in the photocatalytic treatment of cyanotoxins for example based on data reported in table 1 using commercial tio2 degussa p 25 ee o of 23 5 kw h m 3 order 1 and 4361 kw h m 3 order 1 was needed when four 1 6 w uv leds and a 100 w hp hg lamp were used respectively in similar experimental conditions the ee o when uv leds were used was approximately 186 times lower these results highlight how leds become more competitive than conventional light sources however challenges remain on how to fully exploit leds while enhancing homogeneous light distribution in larger scale reactors the development of light transport frameworks such as radial emitting optical fibers show promising perspectives for leds photocatalytic treatments lanzarini lopes et al 2019 tugaoen et al 2017 more research on the photocatalytic degradation of cyanotoxins using led technology is required prior to integrating photocatalyst synthesis and photoreactor design prior to the appearance of technologies such as leds photocatalytic research roadmap aimed the use of natural sunlight to reduce operational costs solar irradiation is a free and renewable source of photons nevertheless fig 7 c illustrates the low intensity of uv light in the solar spectra 4 0 the low irradiance of uv cannot substantially activate photocatalytic response in pure semiconductor materials i e tio2 zno to exploit that untapped resource research efforts focused on the development of visible light driven photocatalysis which harness solar energy as environmentally benign strategy to promote photocatalysis application tables 1 3 reports visible light active photocatalysts that can efficiently remove various cyanotoxins including mc lr and cyn by using artificial visible light or even direct sunlight despite of this promising research steps the complexity of using solar light and designing efficient solar photocatalytic reactors cannot be ignored 5 5 biomimicry based designs of photocatalysts for improved light trapping the biomimetism and bioinspiration approach is one of the most promising challenges in materials design and fabrication for the coming years nature is a true school when it comes to developing basic or highly sophisticated materials and systems with improved properties natural structures are already optimized for defined functionalities and can inspire smart design of more effective materials biomimetic materials are artificial human made materials that mimic the characteristics of natural materials beyond bio inspired design biomimetic research also incorporates the principles of circular and green chemistry to enable a more sustainable and cleaner production of artificial materials sanchez et al 2005 serrà et al 2019a wang et al 2015 zan and wu 2016 in the context of photocatalysis biomimetism could play an important role in the coming years for the development of architectures and systems for improved light trapping photocatalyst synthesis and design should be implemented with the intelligence of the sophisticated architectures and strategies of plants algae and photosynthetic bacteria photosynthetic organisms i e plants algae and certain types of bacteria and photocatalysts use light as an energy source however photosynthetic organisms have developed throughout centuries cooperative light harvesting mechanisms for the efficient photon capture of solar radiation qian et al 2019a serrà et al 2020a 2020c 2019b zhou et al 2009 in the context of fixed photocatalysts fractal and flexible architectures have been proved as smart strategies in photocatalyst design as shown in fig 8 a the phototropism mechanism i e self orientation towards the sun throughout the day of the sunflower inspired the design of sunflower like biomimetic omnidirectional trackers this strategy found that the omnidirectional trackers were able to achieve up to 400 solar energy harvesting improvement compared with non phototropism materials at oblique illumination angles qian et al 2019b natural hierarchical architectures such as plants and leaves exhibit excellent multilevel light scattering high electron diffusion length open and accessible porosity high surface to volume ratios and high light absorption independent from the incident light angle therefore mimicking their architecture and surface properties may result in improved light trapping as shown in fig 8 b c the porous morphology of artificial n doped zno photocatalysts inspired in the macro micro and nanoscale architecture of green leaves increases light absorption by 84 131 zhou et al 2009 as shown in fig 8 d fractal and dendritical architectures of zno based photocatalysts mimicking fern leaves can drastically improve light harvesting even at very high angles of incidence serrà et al 2019b 2019a in the context of non fixed photocatalysts algae and photosynthetic bacteria can also play an important role in the development of micro and nano architectured photocatalysts with improved self propulsion mechanisms as shown in fig 8 e the spirulina platensis microalga was used as a biotemplate for the synthesis of magnetic biohybrid based on zno for the efficient integration of solar photocatalytic water decontamination and bioethanol production the microalgae was selected due to its shape which has been demonstrated effective for harvesting light as well as minimizing sedimentation and agglomeration serrà et al 2020a 2020b similarly various shapes and architectures based on aquatic biota can inspire the design of new photocatalysts 6 decrypting water matrix effects on photocatalytic treatment of cyanotoxins cyanotoxins removal in ultrapure water has been a key stepstone to advance the understanding of photocatalytic technologies however the focus on such unrealistic water matrices may result in an overestimation of photocatalysis capabilities based on academic hype loeb et al 2019 evaluation of challenging conditions even when showing unfavorable assessment in comparison to ideal conditions will not preclude technology transfer opportunities conversely realistic water matrix studies contribute to identify honest challenges and barriers to overcome thus becoming essential elements to ensure successful translation to higher technology readiness levels and actual application water sources contaminated with cyanotoxins e g lakes reservoirs slow moving rivers etc are heterogeneous mixtures of solutes and solids in suspension higher concentration of other organics may compete with cyanotoxins for photogenerated oxidants most natural waters contain natural buffers that limit versatility of easy ph modulation to unrealistic optimum ph conditions reported in tables 1 3 such as high acidic ph 3 0 modification of natural conditions may arise as a major hindrance when considering environmental remediation of lakes this section discusses how photocatalytic degradation of cyanotoxins is critically influenced by characteristics of the water matrix including the presence of natural organic matter nom alkalinity and inorganic ions 6 1 critical influence of natural organic matter natural organic matter nom not only derives from the natural breakdown of terrestrial plants allochthonous plants and as byproduct of aquatic biota autochthonous plants but may also result from human activities nom is an extremely complex mixture of organic compounds humic substances polysaccharides amino sugars proteins peptides lipids protein carbohydrates carboxylic acid amino acid and hydrocarbons with varying polarity acidity molecular mass charge density and biodegradability sillanpää et al 2015 yamamura et al 2014 zhang et al 2009 due to its complexity nom is usually categorized according to its polar i e hydrophobic and hydrophilic and acidic i e acidic neutral or alkaline properties of all organic compounds hydrophobic acids frequently described as humic substances are the chief constituents of nom in bodies of water humic substances consist of humic acids ha which are soluble in alkaline and insoluble in acid fulvic acids which are soluble in alkaline and acidic conditions and humins which are insoluble in both of those conditions bhatnagar and sillanpää 2017 sillanpää et al 2015 although ubiquitous nom occurs to varying degrees depending upon the climate geology biodiversity and topography of each of earth s zones as well as varies spatially and temporally in concentration and composition nom appears in great quantities in bodies of water worldwide concentrations of nom typically range from 2 to 10 mg l 1 in drinking water however its concentration is impossible to generalize in natural bodies of water due to the hydrological and biogeochemical processes that determine its formation matilainen et al 2011 2010 metsämuuronen et al 2014 for example in canada s rivers and lakes concentrations ranging from 3 to 16 ppm are typical whereas concentrations of dissolved nom up to 59 mg l 1 have been detected in northern china s lake hulun located in the sparsely populated hulun buir steppe where minimal direct anthropic effects can be expected chen et al 2012 in the photocatalytic decontamination of cyanotoxins nom has to be considered for it can appear in high concentrations in water sources contaminated with cyanotoxins humic substances can act as photosensitizers by the absorption of sunlight 290 nm visible light it has been reported that under irradiation humic acids may generate small amounts of reactive oxygen species i e oh h2o2 etc this photoactivation event happens about 600 times per hour per humic molecule in mid european natural waters during the summer hoigné et al 1989 these natural photolytic effects are very slow and have negligible effects on cyanotoxins removal half lifetime of about 10 h experimentally estimated for mc rr welker and steinberg 1999 photocatalysis in this regard is not comparable to photocatalytic treatment that can degrade mcs in few minutes see table 1 indeed no photolytic degradation was observed by pelaez et al under visible light irradiation in presence of humic and fulvic substances but in absence of catalyst pelaez et al 2011 yang et al recently reported an excellent study on the effect of nom during photocatalytic treatment of mc lr by uv tio2 percentage of removal of mc lr after 15 min decreased from 99 9 in ultrapure water to 89 0 and 74 3 for increasing nom concentrations of 5 and 10 mg l 1 respectively similar trend is observed when comparing the nom effect on the kinetic rate decrease from 0 261 min 1 at 0 0 mg l 1 of nom 0 144 min 1 at 5 0 mg l 1 of nom and 0 113 min 1 at 10 0 mg l 1 of nom these results prove the inhibitory effect of nom that can be associated to different factors such as i oxidants scavenging ii nanoparticles aggregation induced by surface charge neutralization and iii hindering of light transport feitz et al 1999 zhang et al 2014a however the scavenging effect is considered to be the governing factor of the decrease of photocatalytic performance nom can act as scavenger of photogenerated oh which decreases effective degradation of cyanotoxins in solution during photocatalytic treatment fig 9 a shows the excitation emission fluorescence matrix eefm spectroscopy changes during photocatalytic treatment of samples containing 1 mg l 1 of mc lr and 5 mg l 1 of nom eefm is a sensitive and selective technique that process data on nom fractions based on the differences between chromophores of dissolved organic matter the eefm contour plots show a shift on the fluorescence peak λex λem 325 449 nm to shorter wavelengths λex λem 325 431 nm till complete signal disappearance after 30 min of treatment fig 9 b shows the toc decrease of nom during photocatalytic treatment attaining 53 6 mineralization of initial 5 mg l 1 nom the decrease in fluorescence index observed during eefm analysis reflected a decrease in aromaticity during photocatalytic treatment related to the cleavage of aromatic moieties these results suggest that high molecular fraction of nom is degraded to low molecular weight compounds as verified by organic carbon detection chromatography lc ocd speciation of organics in solution illustrated in fig 9 c it can be observed that the most representative nom were humic acids with close to a 60 in content that is drastically reduced to less than 5 0 in remaining nom whereas the content of low molecular weight neutral and acid species increase in relative content all these results demonstrate the scavenging role of nom and identify humic acids as major competitor in the consumption of photogenerated oxidants i e hvb oh yang et al 2020 nom are complex since scavenging effect is also related to the relative content of humic and fulvic acids as well as the solution ph experimental results of pelaez demonstrate that photocatalytic inhibition is higher with fulvic acid than with humic acid at all ph conditions see table 6 pelaez et al 2011 this trend can be explained by the higher adsorption of fulvic acids on tio2 which results in the direct competition with cyanotoxins for active sites and surface generated oxidants for instance tio2 adsorption in dark conditions showed that 5 0 mg l 1 of suwannee river humic acids achieve 30 1 removal at ph 3 0 22 5 removal at ph 5 0 and 16 7 removal at ph 7 0 after 5 h meanwhile higher removals were attained for 5 0 mg l 1 of suwannee river fulvic acids corresponding to 55 1 removal at ph 3 0 32 3 removal at ph 5 0 and 24 1 removal at ph 7 0 after 5 h interestingly lower kinetic removal of cyanotoxins is reported at higher ph despite of the lower adsorption of nom i e humic and fulvic acids pelaez et al suggested that the coordination complex nom tio2 can mediate the electron transfer from the conduction band of tio2 to an appropriate electron acceptor thus enhancing the stability of oxidants pelaez et al 2011 this effect would compensate up to some extent the competitive consumption of oxidants by nom explaining the lower decrease observed on cyanotoxins removal rate at acidic ph whereas the scavenging effect becomes dominant at alkaline ph due to the lower adsorption of nom lower ecb scavenging effect these mechanisms require further research to fully understand the synergistic effect of nom as electron scavenger solution ph modifies electrostatic surface charge of the solid surface of metal oxides as well nom speciation as discussed above surface of photocatalysts can be neutral positively or negatively charged batista et al 2017 tugaoen et al 2017 the transition between the different conditions is defined by the isoelectric point or point of zero charge phpzc in the case of tio2 the phpzc is 6 2 photocatalyst particles suspended in solutions of ph phpzc are positively charged meanwhile in solutions of ph phpzc are negatively charged according to reactions 10 and 11 respectively it has been reported that adsorbed nom can neutralize surface charge of photocatalysts which induce nanoparticles aggregation yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2014a photocatalyst aggregation decreases available catalytic sites and irradiated photocatalyst surface therefore decreasing photocatalytic degradation performance jefferson et al 2016 10 tioh h tio h 2 ph p h pzc 11 tioh ti o h ph p h pzc the third detrimental effect of nom load in water is associated to decrease on photon delivery to the photocatalyst surface due to hindering of light transport from emission source i e solar light lamp led indeed the photocurrent response of semiconductors is directly associated to the number of photons efficiently delivered per second garcia segura et al 2018 fig 10 shows the absorption spectra of suwannee river humic acids and fulvic acids pelaez et al 2010 it can be seen that both typical nom components have high absorption at the uv visible wavelength range 200 nm 400 nm which will result in the absorption of delivered photons absorption of light by solutes diminish the depth of light penetration reducing photocatalyst activation therefore increase in nom concentration can undermine efficient photoexcitation and diminish generation rate of oxidants it has been observed that highly active uv radiation activity may be limited to near surface layer in eutrophied lakes especially during algal blooms and lyses de lange 2000 6 2 scavenging effects and synergies of inorganic species the content of inorganic species in bodies of water derives primarily from the weathering and leaching of rocks and soils however anthropological activities especially industrial ones are responsible for the discharge of a large number of inorganic species including heavy metals nitrate phosphate perchlorate and fluorides those species are currently considered to be critical pollutants when in excess of permissible limits in bodies of water due to their potential devastating effects upon aquatic biota and human health the content of inorganic species is significantly greater in lakes reservoirs ponds and slow moving rivers than in rivers and streams due to the accumulation of suspended sediments caused by the low velocity of the flow of water in natural water na k mg2 cu2 fe3 and ca2 cations and cl no3 so4 2 hco3 co3 2 and hpo4 2 anions are the most often found nakatani et al 2011 nikanorov et al n d the presence of inorganic cations generally exerts few relevant effects upon the photo oxidation of organic pollutants common cations e g na k ca2 and mg2 in bodies of water cannot capture electrons or holes in solutions because they are all in their highest and most stable states of oxidation however insoluble species of divalent cations associated to water hardness may precipitate on catalyst surface producing scaling i e undesirable crystallization of inert salts on catalyst surface chong et al 2015 sontakke et al 2011 inorganic scaling can inhibit reactivity due to blocking of catalytic sites precipitation of inorganic species can be promoted on catalyst surfaces due to localized ph changes due to heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions bhatkhande et al 2002 kudlek et al 2016 however these aspects are seldomly addressed in research works that focus on the evaluation of catalysts in single use other cationic species of anthropogenic origin may be found in water samples such as heavy metals the presence of cr vi and cu ii can result in the photoreduction of these species on the catalyst surface depending on the conditions that phenomenon can synergistically enhance or inhibit the photo oxidation of organic pollutants deposition of metals on catalysts surfaces can generate metal semiconductor interfaces that act as electron sinks which minimizes recombination reaction 5 and stabilizes oxidants generation beydoun et al 2002 zhao et al 2015 however excess of these species can inhibit photocatalytic activity due to poisoning of catalytic sites or even act as recombination center more attention should be given to these uncontrolled effects that are not usually considered in the study of synthetic water matrices in the case of cyanotoxins the presence of cations slightly affects the kinetics of degradation primarily by reducing the adsorption of mc lr on the photocatalyst s surface due to their interaction with negatively charged mc lr molecules antoniou et al 2010 pinho 2014 zhao et al 2015 the most common inorganic anions in bodies of water i e cl and hco3 co3 2 have demonstrated to chemically active species in presence of photocatalysts herein it is further described the different roles and effects that each individual species may play on the photocatalytic degradation of cyanotoxins chloride is a ubiquitous anion found in the environment in a wide range of concentrations ranging between fresh 0 05 brackish 0 05 3 and saline seawater 3 5 chloride ions can be oxidized by hydroxyl radicals as proven by different aops yielding different active chlorine species lu et al 2005 mostafa et al 2018 fundamentals of reaction mechanisms of chloride with oh were described in the 70s from pulse radiolysis studies which involves several equilibria described in reactions 12 14 hasegawa and neta 1978 jayson et al 1973 12 oh c l hoc l k 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 13 hoc l h h 2 o c l k 2 1 0 10 m 1 s 1 14 c l c l c l 2 k 2 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 non radical chlorine species can be formed from the dimerization of cl radical according reaction 15 or through redox reaction 16 of cl2 radical in the case of photocatalysis chloride can be directly oxidized by direct charge transfer processes on the catalyst surface following reaction 17 then chlorine disproportionate yielding hypochlorite by reaction 18 which is in acid base equilibria 19 with hypochlorous acid it is important to remark that chlorine radical can be generated through uv chlorine process when using uv irradiation through reaction 20 and 21 with reported quantum yields above 1 0 the quantum yields of hclo and clo at 254 nm ranged from 1 4 to 1 7 and from 1 1 to 1 4 mol es 1 respectively conversely at 200 350 nm they ranged from 3 3 to 4 1 mol es 1 for hclo and from 1 4 to 2 1 mol es 1 for clo watts et al 2007 watts and linden 2007 thus these reactions are expected to have significant relevance when photocatalytic operational conditions rely on the use of uv lamp sources 15 2 c l c l 2 16 c l 2 c l 2 e 17 2 c l c l 2 2 e 18 c l 2 2 o h cl o c l h 2 o 19 hclo cl o h p k a 7 5 20 hocl h ν c l oh 21 oc l h ν c l o the reactions described above can consume photogenerated oh and hvb but the contribution of active chlorine species on cyanotoxins abatement cannot be neglected despite their lower oxidation capabilities when compared to oh radical e 2 80 v vs she active chlorine species are still strong oxidants that quickly react with organics lei et al 2019 the standard reduction potential of the different active chlorine species involved in above mechanisms can be classified in decreasing order of oxidative power as follows cl e 2 55 v vs she cl2 e 2 13 v vs she hclo e 1 49 v vs she cl2 e 1 36 v vs she clo e 0 89 v vs she the competitive aspect of those oxidants is that they are not limited by mass transfer due to their homogeneous character yang s group demonstrated that the formation of reactive chloride species contributes to attain significant removal of mc lr in a uv chlorine system chuang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al concluded that the reactive chlorine species attack the conjugated dienes in mc lr by reacting selectively with electron donors sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b the participation of reactive chlorine species in the degradation of mc lr during photoelectrocatalytic degradation using tio2 based photocatalysts was also demonstrated fraga et al 2009 shi et al 2005 nevertheless thorough studies on the effect of chloride ion during cyanotoxins photocatalytic degradation have yet to be conducted special attention should be given to possible yield of chlorinated organics and disinfection by products also common in bodies of water are bicarbonate and carbonate the speciation of carbonates in natural waters is defined by their in acid base equilibria according reactions 22 and 23 bicarbonate carbonate and hydroxide ions are the main species responsible for alkalinity in water water alkalinity is a crucial water quality parameter that indicates the buffering capacity of water i e the capacity to resist changes in the ph alkalinity is usually measured in parts per million of the equivalent carbonate ions jefferson et al 2016 olivo alanis et al 2019 bicarbonate and carbonate anions react with hydroxyl ions to form carbonate radicals following reactions 24 and 25 respectively carbonate radicals pose a significantly lower redox potential e 1 78 v vs she than hydroxyl radicals e 2 80 v vs she liu et al 2016 thus these weaker oxidants decrease the overall efficiency of the photocatalytic degradation of cyanotoxins carbonates inhibit the photodegradation of cyanotoxins and other organic compounds due to their strong scavenging activity for hydroxyl radicals figure 11 shows that the initial reaction rate of the degradation of mc lr under a visible light activated tio2 is dramatically affected by the presence of carbonates pelaez et al 2011 first it can be inferred that speciation depending on ph is one of the key aspects of alkalinity inhibition it can be observed that at given concentration of 50 mg l 1 of na2co3 at ph 7 1 the photocatalytic degradation of mc lr was not statistically different from the blank experiments conducted in absence of na2co3 conversely identical concentration of 50 mg l 1 of na2co3 at ph 10 3 resulted in complete inhibition of photocatalytic removal of mc lr this trend is explained by the stronger scavenger activity of carbonate that reacts with oh according 25 with a kinetic constant k 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 two order of magnitude higher than bicarbonate k 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 second the increasing concentration of carbonate bicarbonate ions has a detrimental effect on mc lr degradation kinetics despite the negligible effect observed at ph 7 1 for 50 mg l 1 of na2co3 with a degradation rate of mc lr of 0 54 10 3 μm min 1 inhibition due to oh scavenging was observed at higher na2co3 concentrations thus doubling content of na2co3 to 100 mg l 1 of na2co3 decelerates degradation rate by ca 35 down to 0 34 10 3 μm min 1 further addition of alkalinity reaching 150 mg l 1 of na2co3 slows down degradation rate by 80 to 0 09 10 3 μm min 1 these results agree with the trends observed for other specific scavengers of oh and identify water alkalinity as one of the major hindrances for photocatalytic application in natural waters pelaez et al 2011 22 h 2 c o 3 hc o 3 h p k a 6 4 23 hc o 3 c o 3 2 h p k a 10 2 24 oh hco 3 co 3 h 2 o k 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 25 oh co 3 2 co 3 o h k 3 9 10 9 m 1 s 1 studies have demonstrated that not only ionic strength but also natural organic matter and ph are some of the primary factors governing the surface charge of photocatalysts borgnino 2013 brown et al 1997 hu et al 2010 zareei et al 2019 the stability and aggregation kinetics of photocatalysts have important effects on the adsorption of cyanotoxins and their photocatalytic degradation the dlvo derjaguin landau verwey and overbeek theory is normally used to explain the stability and aggregation behavior of particles in aqueous environments based on this theory the total interaction energy wt is the sum of lifshitz van der waals forces wlw and the electrical double layer interactions wel between particles however other non dlvo forces such as hydration steric effects and hydrophobic forces can also dramatically affect the interaction between particles variations in the ionic strength govern the range of the double layer interaction and contribute to the modification of the particles effective charge schwegmann et al 2013 zareei et al 2019 the debye hückel thickness can be decreased by increasing the ionic strength consequently the electrostatic repulsion weakens increased ionic strength translates to decreased columbic contribution which induces particles aggregation the aggregation of suspended photocatalysts is detrimental for photocatalytic performance since substantially decreases the active surface area available as interface for the photocatalytic reaction with cyanotoxins moreover larger particulates obstruct light transport diminishing the extent photoexcitation reaction 1 the effect of total dissolved solids in water matrices require further attention since it may deviate behavior from ideal conditions in ultrapure water 6 3 treatment of natural water samples senogles et al conducted the first evaluation of photocatalytic treatment performance in natural water samples collected from north pine dam raw water south east queensland australia this natural resource has typical concentrations of 20 μg l 1 of cyn with spikes of concentration reaching levels of 70 μg l 1 due to algal blooms senogles et al 2001 natural and synthetic water samples were treated using tio2 p25 doses of 0 1 g l 1 under uv light irradiation dose 5000 μw s cm 2 reported half lives indicate faster abatement of cyn in real water samples t1 2 4 4 min than in ultrapure water samples t1 2 16 5 min these results were associated to the synergistic role of inorganic species in e g chlorine active species generated from chloride solution as described above which suggest high competitivity of photocatalysis as water treatment technology to minimize the impact of cyanotoxins in raw water sources senogles et al 2001 conversely deleterious effects were observed on the treatment of 1 0 μm cyn spiked in real water samples collected from east fort lake and toledo water plant ohio usa while tio2 treatment under uv irradiation in synthetic water reported kinetic rate constants of cyn abatement of 33 0 10 2 min 1 the kinetic rate dramatically decreased down to 1 9 10 2 min 1 east fort lake 5 1 mg l 1 of toc and 4 59 10 2 min 1 toledo water plant 3 2 mg l 1 of toc the reduction of performance of over 10 fold was ascribed to the scavenging effects of nom and other water matrix components zhang et al 2014a dionysiou s group reported a complete study on the performance of visible active photocatalyst in real water samples natural waters were collected from lake erie ohio usa and st john s river florida usa which have reported increasing episodes of cyanobacterial blooms over the last decade fig 12 depicts the normalized abatement of mc lr by photocatalysis under visible light using a nitrogen and fluorine doped tio2 nf tio2 in different water matrix pelaez et al 2011 dotted lines illustrate removal trends of lab made solutions in ultrapure water i e no matrix effects that show a clear dependence of ph on performance as discussed in previous sections complete abatement of mc lr was attained after 3h of treatment at ph 3 0 while a discrete removal of 15 2 was observed at ph 8 0 this is of high relevance given the natural ph conditions of the water samples of ph 7 0 8 5 see water characteristics in fig 12 null degradation was reported for the visible photocatalytic treatment in real water matrices the low performance can be explained by surface interaction and competitive phenomena involving solutes in natural waters such as the high content of nom ranging between 2 5 9 5 mg l 1 of toc pelaez et al 2011 conversely fig 12 shows that photocatalytic treatment under solar irradiation attains high degree of mc lr degradation due to the contribution of the uv component treatment of lake erie samples and st john s river attained 95 3 and 86 9 removal respectively slight differences can be justified by the higher scavenger character of st john s river water matrix that contained a higher load of nom and alkalinity see table 7 which diminished the degradation ate of mc lr even though the promising premises of sustainable character of visible photocatalysts these cannot achieve cyanotoxins removal in natural water samples this is a critical conclusion that should redefine research efforts towards development of engineering strategies that maximize light delivery and exploitation of uv irradiation for cyanotoxins remediation 7 significance of photocatalytic reactor design for technology translation photocatalysis was proven to be an effective technology for cyanotoxins abatement even in natural water sources research in small batch reactors of 5 ml 20 ml see tables 1 3 was essential to develop i fundamental understanding of photocatalysis capabilities ii degradative pathways elucidation and iii breakthroughs on materials development however research focus at this low technology readiness level may be missing the big picture problem required to address cyanotoxins global challenges see fig 1 translation of photocatalytic technologies should consider treatment of large volumes of water in this frame strategies to tackle the environmental problem of cyanotoxins should distinguish between two points of action that would condition engineering decisions for reactor design and photocatalyst material selection i treatment of lakes or ii detoxification of water sources for drinking purposes at point of entry point of use the value proposition for the treatment of lakes with high concentration of cyanotoxins envisions the use of solar light active photocatalysts which will reduce operational expenses associated to lamp sources jo and tayade 2014 natarajan et al 2011 ye et al 2018 even though the resulting reduction on electrical energy per order ee o requirements is a high promise the deployment of the treatment is still a major engineering challenge the treatment of large volumes of semi stagnant water in lakes by photocatalytic treatment of lakes is an unreachable horizon given the actual state of the art loeb et al 2019 it is obvious that sprinkling lakes with photocatalyst nanoparticles at doses of grams per liter cannot be considered feasible environmental risks and concerns arose from fate and transport of nanoparticles as well as from their sedimentation andy et al 2008 petosa et al 2010 beyond catalyst sedimentation photocatalyst performance can be seriously undermined by limited light transport through lake water bodies safe implementation of nanotechnology for environmental applications may require controlled systems to tackle these engineering challenges friehs et al 2016 haynes et al 2017 wagner et al 2011 passive treatment systems that use supported catalyst have recently appeared as a promising strategy for the case scenario of lakes and reservoirs floating nanocomposite photocatalysts can be deployed and easily recovered reuse after environmental intervention these processes which have been barely explored for cyanotoxins may be an opportunity for the implementation of photo driven cyanotoxins remediation technologies a different case scenario can be observed when detoxification of water sources is desired to ensure access to drinking water photocatalytic detoxification can be implemented to treat collected water in continuous operation mode solar driven treatment can benefit of the use of photoreactors that ensure efficient solar radiation collection and or concentration solar photocatalytic reactors aim to maximize the usage of solar irradiation direct sun irradiation on conventional flat photoreactors results in severe losses of delivered light in this frame alternative reactors maximize light delivery by concentration in tubular reactors this is the case of compound parabolic collectors cpcs that have a light concentration factor close to one i e maximum efficiency concentration is attained by defining reflector geometry to redirect indirect light by reflection into the tubular reactor see fig 13 spasiano et al 2015 engineering design tailoring optimization of light delivery allows i diminishing reactor footprint when compared to commercial flat reactors and ii operation during overcast days due to concentration of indirect sunlight solar driven photocatalysis presents benefits as decentralized treatments that can operate off grid in developing areas however the reactor set ups described above have a great physical foot print moreover the slower kinetic abatement observed for solar light photocatalysis when benchmarked against uv photocatalysis raises some operational questions depending on techno economic considerations it must be more competitive to consider systems that remove cyanotoxins in compact reactors with lower residence times despite of requiring uv light sources reactors that use photocatalysts in slurry require post treatments that separate suspended heterogeneous catalysts after treatment for example commercially available photo cat systems of purifics depicted in fig 13 implements a patented continuous tio2 separation process that allows recapture and reintroduction of catalyst into the inlet stream in a closed loop fluidized bed reactors are continuous flow systems in which a fluid i e the water being treated is circulated at enough velocity to maintain particulate solids in continuous suspension the solid particles remain in constant agitation and swirl around through the fluidized bed avoiding their agglomeration under the so called fluidized state particles in fluidized state behave as they were fluids which improves kinetics of heterogeneous catalytic processes such as photocatalysis fluidized bed slurries keep the photocatalysts particles within the expanded bed of the reactor for their continuous use fang et al 2019 lee et al 2004 rincón and la motta 2019 shet and vidya 2016 in other words catalyst recovery is not required since fluidized particles do not leave the fluidized bed reactor during operation these reactors present wide opportunity of application at short residence times and can be easily modified for simultaneous uv disinfection by defining fluidized bed height see fig 13 the use of films or deposited photocatalysts is an interesting approach that will prevent issues associated to the recovery of nanoparticles even though the required treatment times may be longer than those for slurry systems several works have demonstrated the competitiveness of photocatalytic films on the removal of cyanotoxins antoniou et al 2009 han et al 2011 slower kinetics can be explained by the decrease on available surface area and the noticeable control of the degradation kinetics by mass transfer towards from the photocatalyst surface espíndola et al 2019 han et al 2011 however the development of these static systems provides opportunities for alternative reactor designs alternatives to slurry operation have been explored using catalytic converters as packed bed reactors the major issue of packed bed reactors is associated to photon transport and the possible shadowing effect of surrounding substrates in packed bed or monolith reactors which may diminish the irradiated surface pinho et al demonstrated that transparent monoliths can outperform conventional supports e g glass spheres silica polyvinylchloride supports etc the high performance of these honeycomb three dimensional transparent arrays it attributable to the large specific photoactive surface area that can be efficiently irradiated pinho et al 2015b this can be explained by the reduced shadowing effect as can be deduced from transmittance characteristics of supports illustrated in fig 14 these engineering approaches define possible pathways for supported photocatalysts reactor design that ensure light transport and mass transfer another issue observed in deposited photocatalysts systems is the loss of photocatalytic performance due to the charge carriers recombination however the use of heterogeneous supported systems provides a unique framework that may enable photoelectrocatalytic treatments garcia segura and brillas 2017 the application of a small bias potential can enhance the separation between the charge carriers due to the existence of an external electrical field which avoids or at least slows down the recombination reaction rate cerrón calle et al 2019 it has been observed that photoelectrocatalytic systems can have enhanced performance of film semiconductors when degrading cyanotoxins liao et al 2013 zhao et al 2019 previous systems use energy intensive lamps i e mercury lamps advances in uv light emitting diodes leds have increased light output energy efficiency durability and cost competitiveness chen et al 2017 integration of leds can drastically reduce physical footprint of photocatalytic reactors and their electrical energy requirements few attempts to implement leds have faced light delivery as a major engineering challenge hou and ku 2013 natarajan et al 2011 o neal tugaoen et al 2018a light transport can be improved with photocatalyst coated optical fibers that homogeneously distribute light along the coating as illustrated in fig 15 pure optical fibers transport light occurs via internal reflection with negligible refraction losses when fibers are coated with photocatalysts of refractive index n 2 higher than the characteristic value of the optical fiber n 1 refraction events can deliver light to photoexcite the photocatalyst i e tio2 since light is delivered through the fiber at the internal interface of the catalyst light losses by absorption of solutes and scattering by solids in suspension are avoided which increases efficient use of photons despite of all the interesting approaches discussed in this section photocatalytic treatment of cyanotoxins in water samples at reactor scale has been barely studied benchmarking and techno economic analyses have not yet been conducted therefore engineering decision factors have not yet been defined scaling up and reactor testing can be highlighted as an essential element of the research roadmap to bridge promising lab scale advances with the need of proofs of concept at higher technology readiness level this can be a niche opportunity for photocatalytic systems translation to markets 8 conclusions and key insights on challenges and perspectives worldwide cyanotoxins are recognized as hazardous emerging pollutants in water due to their widespread distribution and occurrence even so due to the limited analytical capabilities the environmental challenge posed by cyanotoxins may be more difficult than it seems worse still conventional water treatment technologies have proven ineffective in removing all cyanotoxins simultaneously as a solution photocatalysis has emerged as promising alternative that has shown exceptional effectiveness in removing intra and extracellular cyanotoxins in addition fundamental studies have elucidated some intricate degradation pathways of cyanotoxins i e mc lr and cyn and demonstrated the complete abatement of parent compounds as well as their toxicity reliance on the use of semiconductor photocatalysts with wide band gaps i e tio2 with eg 3 0 ev require uv irradiation sources because conventional uv light lamps e g mercury lamps and xenon lamps are energy intensive researchers have sought to develop doping strategies that can enable photocatalytic response under visible light and solar irradiation however the ongoing development of led technology could change the paradigm by offering a more cost effective competitive source of light in the same direction relevant advances have indicated that the research roadmap should shift focus from developing materials to implementing technology at higher levels of readiness although doping and using nano composite photocatalysts are interesting approaches to that end neither strategy has advanced the implementation of photocatalytic treatment as expected instead efficient light transport and the improvement of light sources have had the most relevant impact in the field as a result the innovation of material is envisioned to derive from principles of biomimicry as a means to enhance selectivity and light transport developing materials that emulate natural structures of photosynthetic organisms e g plants and bacteria could revolutionize the efficient use of delivered photons initial hype about photocatalytic treatment was based on outstanding performance under unrealistic lab settings that allowed treating small volumes of water with highly energy intensive lamps major challenges were identified in real water matrices in which degradation kinetics had decelerated due to the presence of scavengers and competing species gauging the effectiveness of photocatalysts thus needs to occur to more realistic environments and consider the influence of natural organic matter and inorganic species further research to improve even optimize the photocatalyst performance in complex environments and in large volumes as well as mimicking natural water in real world environments is also urgently needed understanding the effects of water matrices can aid in strategizing novel materials or at least identifying niche applications of photocatalytic processes beyond that the greatest barrier to translating technology is the lack of any reactor design that can completely exploit photocatalysis in the treatment of large volumes of water e g lakes and reservoirs polluted with cyanotoxins optimized treatment conditions for small volumes in batch reactors are mostly unrealistic and inapplicable when considering the true scale of the environmental challenge thus it identifies the development of engineering designed reactors and treatment strategies to be truly competitive alternatives in that sense reactor design and techno economic evaluation are truly major hurdles in translating the results of research into practice research efforts should be directly toward configuring benchmark reactors and comparing passive treatment systems with active ones to fully exploit promising photocatalytic treatments for cyanotoxins remediation finally the development of new low cost doped wavelength targeted catalysts are significant advances that could make photocatalytic oxidation more competitive and cost effective this is a feature that can be fully exploited with led lights as cheap and energy
