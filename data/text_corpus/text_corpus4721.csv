23605,this paper proposes a four layer submerged horizontal porous plate breakwater to improve the wave dissipation efficiency under a wide range of incident wave frequencies especially long incident waves and also discusses the design of the geometrical parameters i e plate submergence and porosity the breakwater performance was examined experimentally in a two dimensional wave flume the effects of the layer number breakwater width upper plate porosity and incident wave height were compared increasing the layer number and breakwater width or reducing the upper plate porosity can be favorable to energy dissipation for long incident waves a moderate alteration of the submerged depth of each layer shifts the proportion of energy reflected or transmitted but minimally affects the energy dissipation performance in addition the incident wave height affects both energy dissipation and mass overtopping and the combined effect is related to the incident wave frequency and steepness generally the proposed four layer breakwater demonstrates satisfactory performance under a wide range of incident wavelengths and has promising future applications in coastal engineering an optimized design for the plate porosity and submergence can be expected to further improve the breakwater performance and a detailed mechanism for non linear wave interactions with the submerged horizontal porous plate warrants further study keywords breakwater horizontal porous plate multi layer submerged experiment energy dissipation 1 introduction as an economical and ecologically friendly wave dissipation and coastal protection structure the horizontal porous plate breakwater offers advantages over those of caisson rubble mound and vertical wall types yu 2002 liu et al 2008 in contrast to conventional bottom mounded breakwaters a horizontal plate breakwater type can be designed as floating or pile supported type which is less dependent on bad sea conditions and water depths furthermore horizontal plates can avoid heavy horizontal wave force impacting on the structure and the porosity further reduces the vertical force and attenuates additional wave energy however the wave dissipating performance of the horizontal plate type breakwater is largely influenced by its submergence and geometry parameters i e plate width and porosity therefore research on wave interaction with horizontal porous plates is needed to predict the performance and optimize the design for engineering applications the submerged horizontal plate was proposed as a breakwater in the 1970s hattori 1975 siew and hurley 1977 hattori and matsumoto 1977 and since then its characteristics i e coefficients of wave reflection transmission energy dissipation and vertical force related to variations of plate width submerged depth and incident wavelength have been widely investigated several early investigations into the fully submerged solid horizontal plate e g the maximal reflection and the minimal transmission problem by patarapanich 1984 and patarapanich and cheong 1989 the effect of moorings on the total reflection and total transmission coefficients of a moored horizontal plate by mciver 1985 and the ability to reflect short incident waves by liu and iskandarani 1991 revealed several limitations of the horizontal solid plate when used as a breakwater the solid plate has little to no effect on attenuation of wave energy mostly by breaking scattered waves over the plate and inducing vortices at the plate tips see e g dick and brebner 1969 patarapanich and cheong 1989 yu et al 1995 brossard and chagdali 2001 incident waves in a specific frequency band which is usually relatively narrow can be blocked and reflected and waves that propagate into the lee side might cause resonance in the sheltered area and degrade sailing conditions therefore a breakwater with porous plates was proposed and its wave dissipating performance is enhanced by porosity induced vortices yu and chwang 1994 chwang and wu 1994 yip and chwang 1998 yu and chwang 1994 suggested that the proper porosity could maintain the wave transmission at a low level while suppressing the wave reflection and the vertical force on the plate and an investigation into the wave interaction with a periodic pitching porous plate by yip and chwang 1998 indicated a similar conclusion cho and kim 2000 considered the hydroelastic effect of a horizontal porous flexible membrane on wave blocking performance under monochromatic incident waves for a membrane of relatively small width greater flexibility leads to better wave blocking performance whereas for a relatively wide membrane increasing the flexibility worsen the performance except under notably long and short waves in addition the study also indicated that a membrane of larger size does not necessarily produce better performance the wave dissipating performance of a submerged inclined plate breakwater was investigated analytically by cho and kim 2008 and examined experimentally by rao et al 2009 a porous plate of the proper inclination angle near the free surface is favorable to performance cho and kim 2013 investigated the interaction of oblique monochromatic incident waves with a submerged horizontal porous plate and indicated that a plate porosity value near 0 1 and a submerged depth near 0 05 h 0 1 h might be optimal for the performance where h is the water depth nonetheless only one layer of the submerged plate might not create sufficient efficiency under large variations of the tidal level or a wide range of incident wave frequencies the twin plate breakwater which consists of a horizontal surface plate and a submerged plate located immediately below the surface plate was investigated analytically by usha and gayathri 2005 and experimentally by neelamani and gayathri 2006 although wave transmission can be greatly reduced by the breakwater with a surface plate the wave reflection is quite significant additionally liu et al 2008 analytically examined a double layer submerged horizontal plate breakwater with an upper porous plate and a lower solid plate and indicated that the proper porosity of the upper plate can aid in suppressing the vertical force on both layers at a relatively low level and the efficiency could be further enhanced by making the lower plate permeable as well more recently wave interaction with double layer submerged horizontal porous plates was investigated by cho et al 2013 and liu and li 2014 based on both numerical solutions and experimental results and the effect of plate submergence and porosity was discussed the results from cho et al 2013 indicated that the contribution of the lower plate to wave dissipation might be weakened if the spacing between the two plates exceeds 10 of the water depth this result implied that a limitation of the covered water depth exists for a double layer horizontal plate breakwater and its efficiency in dissipating long incident waves the energy of which propagate more deeply therefore one solution is to increase the layer number a breakwater that consists of a stack of horizontal solid plates has been proposed wang and shen 1999 wang et al 2006 wang and shen 1999 suggested that the spacing between layers should be relatively small to improve the multi layer breakwater s performance and the related experimental study conducted by wang et al 2006 demonstrated that the upright wave force acting on the solid plate is relatively strong however investigations into the wave dissipating performance of a multi layer submerged horizontal porous plate breakwater are not yet found in the published literature this paper proposes a four layer submerged horizontal porous plate breakwater the addition of the lower two plates is intended to improve the performance under long incident waves with properly designed plate porosity improvement in wave dissipation can be achieved while suppressing the vertical wave force the performance of the proposed breakwater was examined using physical model tests in a two dimensional wave flume the following section discusses the design of the geometrical parameters i e submergence and porosity of plates the third section describes the experiment setup and the details of test cases the experimental results of specific characteristics i e the effect of layer number plate width porosity and submergence are shown and discussed thereafter the final section illustrates the conclusions 2 design of the breakwater the horizontal porous plate plays a role in attenuating the incident wave energy by obstructing the vertical motion of fluid particles inducing vortices and breaking scattered waves over the plate the vertical velocity distribution of fluid particles makes a significant difference in the wave dissipation efficiency hence the fluid velocity distribution should be taken into consideration in breakwater design considering the inviscid and incompressible water and irrotational flow in a two dimensional domain x o z of which the origin is set on the free surface the velocity potential ϕ of the monochromatic propagating wave can be written as eq 1 based on the linear wave theory 1 ϕ g a ω cosh k z h cosh k h sin k x ω t where g is the gravitational acceleration a is the incident wave amplitude h is the constant water depth ω and k denote the incident wave frequency and wave number respectively x and z are spatial coordinates and t is time the velocity amplitude of fluid particles along the submerged depth can be described as 2 u a g k ω cosh k z h cosh k h 3 v a g k ω sinh k z h cosh k h where u and v denote the amplitudes of the horizontal and vertical velocity respectively figure 1 shows the variation of vertical velocity component with submerged depth under four different incident wave numbers the dimensionless wave numbers k h 1 0 8 0 in which the vertical velocity is normalized by that on the free surface v z 0 the vertical velocity drops swiftly as the submerged depth increases under relatively short incident waves whereas under longer incident waves relatively significant amplitudes can be maintained in deeper water a relatively small submergence of the upper plate and spacing between the upper and the second plates are favorable to the breakwater s efficiency however submerged depths of these two plates that are too small might render the breakwater too sensitive to water level changes e g tides furthermore the submerged depth of the lower plate must be considered to maintain the efficiency under relatively long incident waves compared with an optimized design of the double layer breakwater suggested in cho et al 2013 d 1 h 0 1 and d 2 h 0 2 as shown in fig 2 a the four layer breakwater as shown in fig 2 b has a relatively small submerged depth for the upper plate but maintains adequate extension of the covered water depth this design makes the four layer breakwater not only efficient at the designed water level but also more adaptive in the case of tidal variation for an incident wave of k h 1 the vertical velocity of fluid particles at a depth of 0 4 h decreases to less than 60 of that on the free surface and the corresponding kinetic energy decreases to approximately 30 because of the square relation hence plates located deeper than 40 of the water depth have a minimal benefit on the wave dissipating efficiency therefore in the current design of the four layer breakwater the submerged depth of the upper plate d 1 was set at 0 05 h and that of the lower plate was set at 0 4 h the middle two plates were located at depths of 0 125 h and 0 25 h respectively the plate porosity is another parameter that must be determined because it affects the energy attenuating efficiency as well as the hydrodynamic force acting on the plate research by liu et al 2008 suggested that the dimensionless porous effect parameter g in the range from 10 1 to 10 0 is proper for the upper plate additionally the porosity p of 0 1 0 2 is implied as optimal for the horizontal porous plate see cho and kim 2013 cho et al 2013 liu and li 2014 considering the above two points and based on the empirical formula g 57 63 p 0 9717 2 π see cho and kim 2008 the plate porosity in the current design was set at p 0 125 g 0 992 correspondingly 3 experimental setup the physical model tests were conducted in the two dimensional wave flume located at the state key laboratory of ocean engineering shanghai jiao tong university china the wave flume is 14 m long 1 m wide and 1 2 m deep with a flap type wave maker installed at one end and a slope wave absorber installed at the other end as shown in fig 3 the water depth was set to 0 8 m in the tests the physical model consisted of an aluminum frame and a certain number of porous plates with uniform circular holes these plates were 2 mm in thickness mounted horizontally on the frame and also supported by four slender columns in the middle to reinforce the stiffness as shown in fig 4 the frame was fixed to an installation beam above the middle of the flume using four three component force transducers the geometrical details of each model are listed in table 1 in which p j and d j denote the porosity and submerged depth of the plate j respectively and n is the layer number models of two widths 0 45 m and 0 60 m were tested and compared to examine the effect of layer number breakwaters of 0 45 m width with two four and eight layers of horizontal porous plates and breakwaters of 0 60 m width with two and four layers were tested additionally for four layer breakwaters of 0 60 m width different porosities of the upper plate p 1 0 05 0 08 0 125 and 0 18 and two sets of plate submergences d j 0 04 m 0 10 m 0 20 m 0 32 m and d j 0 05 m 0 15 m 0 25 m 0 35 m were tested regular waves of two heights h 2 cm and 4 cm were applied in the tests for each wave height nineteen different periods varying from 0 6 s to 1 5 s at an interval of 0 05 s were generated the corresponding dimensionless wave numbers k h ranged between 8 95 and 1 56 additionally in the cases of model no 5 another regular wave height of 6 cm with periods in the range of 0 8 1 5 s and a white noise wave were applied the time history of the white noise wave elevation and its spectrum are shown in fig 5 wave crest heights are moderate and there is no blank frequency band in the spectrum because what matters in the experiment is the ratio of the reflected or transmitted wave amplitudes to the incident wave amplitudes the white noise wave is qualified for the test despite the difference between measured and target spectrum in the low and high frequency parts to discriminate the incident reflected and transmitted components from the measured time histories of wave elevation the three point method developed by mansard and funke 1980 was applied in the tests this method offers the advantages of excellent robustness under a wide range of incident wave frequencies and insensitivity to probe spacing and signal noise six wave probes were used with three located upstream of the model numbered from 1 to 3 and the others located downstream numbered from 4 to 6 according to the suggestion from mansard and funke 1980 the spacing between adjacent wave probes was set to 0 15 m and 0 22 m respectively to eliminate singularities for regular wave tests the amplitude and phase difference of the fundamental wave at each wave probe position written as complex numbers ζ n n 1 2 6 were estimated by the fft fast fourier transform technique with a hann window and an interpolation algorithm developed by andria et al 1989 using the interpolation algorithm in andria et al 1989 the amplitude and phase angle of measured signal can be obtained with sufficient accuracy even when sampling time is relatively short this compensates the limitation of data length in the long wave cases the phase angles of the wave records at probe no 1 and no 4 were given as zero because only the wave dissipating coefficients related to fundamental waves were of interest in the current study higher harmonics induced by the submerged horizontal plates were not considered during the data processing and were filtered out the equation set in which the incident and reflected components a i and a r respectively are involved can be written as follows 4 a i a r ε 1 ζ 1 a i e i k x 2 x 1 a r e i k x 2 x 1 ε 2 ζ 2 a i e i k x 3 x 1 a r e i k x 3 x 1 ε 3 ζ 3 where ε n n 1 2 3 denotes the uncertainty of measurement of probe no n x n denotes the coordinate of probe no n and a i and a r are complex numbers that represent both the amplitudes and phase angles of the incident wave and the reflected wave respectively in the experiment x 2 x 1 0 15 m and x 3 x 1 0 37 m using the least squares method see mansard and funke 1980 the values of a i and a r were obtained the incident wave height h i and reflected wave height h r were given by h i 2 a i and h r 2 a r the transmitted wave height h t was obtained similarly based on the measured wave records of probes no 4 6 the amplitudes of total horizontal and vertical wave forces f x and f z respectively were obtained by the four three component force transducers and the fft technique consequently the parameters of the breakwater s wave dissipating performance including wave transmission coefficient c t reflection coefficient c r energy dissipation coefficient c d horizontal force coefficient c f x and vertical force coefficient c f z which are elements of interest in the tests and also in engineering practice can be obtained as follows 5 c t h t h i 6 c r h r h i 7 c d 1 c t 2 c r 2 8 c f x f x ρ g h i w b 9 c f z f z ρ g h i w b where ρ is the density of water and b is the flume width for the white noise wave tests the technique described above was applied to each frequency band the amplitude and phase difference were obtained by auto and cross spectral density analyses respectively and the necessary spectral smoothing was applied to reduce erratic variations of the spectrum 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of layer number the sub figures in fig 6 show comparisons of the wave transmission reflection energy dissipation and vertical force coefficients of the 0 45 m wide breakwaters with two four and eight layers models no 1 3 respectively the right portion of each sub figure represents the corresponding relative differences compared with the values of the two layer case with values given in percent the performances of the 0 6 m wide breakwaters with two and four layers models no 4 and no 5 respectively are illustrated in the sub figures of fig 7 additionally the horizontal wave force coefficients of these breakwaters are shown in fig 8 generally the multi layer submerged horizontal porous plate breakwater exhibits good efficiency in dissipation of incident waves wave reflection and transmission can be suppressed at a relatively low level and satisfactory wave energy dissipating efficiency is achieved under a wide range of incident wave lengths the total vertical wave forces are within reasonable limits and the total horizontal forces are even an order of magnitude lower than the vertical forces as shown in fig 8 which is a significant advantage in terms of safety however the breakwater becomes less efficient when the incident wavelength increases in addition to the increase in wave reflection the wave transmission and total force increase more significantly as well for the two layer breakwater that is 0 45 m wide c t exceeds 0 5 under k h 2 indicating inefficiency in blocking long incident waves improvement in the efficiency of blocking long incident waves can be achieved by adding additional submerged plates for a breakwater of 0 45 m width the wave transmission coefficient under k h 3 is reduced by approximately 10 15 in the four layer case and by approximately 20 in the eight layer case compared with that in the two layer case a greater amount of wave energy is attenuated under long incident waves although c r increases slightly for breakwaters with additional layers the total vertical wave force increases by less than 30 when the layer number doubles e g comparing the c f z values of the four layer case with those of the two layer one and the increase in c f x is moderate approximately 30 60 when the layer number doubles however under moderate and short incident waves e g k h 3 the c t values increase slightly as the layer number increases which is likely correlated with that the energy attenuating effect on shorter waves is weakened because of smaller spacing between the upper and the second plates the difference in c r and in c f z as well as in c f x between breakwaters of different layer numbers tends to vanish moreover the spacing between layers of the eight layer breakwater appears too small to maintain its efficiency in dissipating short waves and c t values under k h 4 increase significantly a similar trend is observed in the cases with 0 6 m width whereas the improvement in performance is more notable when the layer number increases the c r values of the four layer breakwater are reduced by approximately 20 40 under k h 3 compared with those of the two layer counterpart illustrating a remarkable increase in wave energy dissipation efficiency because of small magnitude of the horizontal wave force it will not be concerned in the following discussions 4 2 effect of plate width for models no 1 and no 4 breakwaters with the same porosity p 0 125 for each layer number of layers two layers and submerged depth d j 4 cm 16 cm but different plate widths w 0 45 m and 0 60 m were tested to examine the effect of plate width the measured values of c t c r c d and c f z are shown in fig 9 together with the corresponding relative differences compared with the values of w 0 45 m in addition a comparison between different plate widths in the four layer case i e models no 2 and no 5 is shown in fig 10 in both the two and four layer cases increasing the plate width can improve the wave dissipating performance and suppress both wave reflection and transmission especially under 2 k h 4 because of the diffraction effect of long incident waves additional wave energy can be trapped by a breakwater with a larger width and the transmission coefficient displays a more rapid drop when the incident wavelength diminishes the c t values of the 0 6 m wide breakwater are reduced by approximately 40 60 and the c r values are reduced by approximately 30 50 under 2 k h 4 compared with the results from the 0 45 m wide breakwater in general a breakwater with 0 6 m width exhibits a better ability to dissipate incident waves of 2 k h 4 the four layer breakwater with 0 6 m width shows even better performance than that of the eight layer breakwater with 0 45 m width see the results of model no 3 in fig 6 which implies that increasing the plate width can offer more direct and notable improvement in the wave dissipating performance of the horizontal plate breakwater in addition in terms of the wave load the breakwater with 0 6 m width shows smaller c f z values as well as c f x values see fig 8 indicating that the total wave force might not increase significantly as the plate width increases however the difference in the wave dissipating performance becomes insignificant under k h 5 as shown in figs 10 a and c implying that the advantage of a wider breakwater tends to vanish under short waves and that a plate width that is too large might be unnecessary under certain prevailing wave climates 4 3 effect of plate porosity for models no 5 8 different porosities of the upper plate p 1 0 125 0 18 0 08 and 0 05 were tested in the context of the four layer breakwater and the results are shown in fig 11 relative differences compared with the values of model no 5 p 1 0 125 are shown in the right portion of each sub figure and snapshots of models no 5 6 and 8 in waves of h 2 cm are shown in fig 12 it can be observed that the porosity of the upper plate significantly influences the wave blocking performance lower porosity can benefit the wave blocking performance under long incident waves as shown in fig 11 a p 1 of 0 08 or 0 05 results in favorable efficiency for suppression of long wave transmission in comparison with the breakwater of p 1 0 125 fig 12 a p 1 of 0 05 fig 12 e enhances the disturbance of the wave field significantly under long incident waves for short waves however lowering the porosity of the upper plate has the opposite effect a value of p 1 that is too small e g 0 05 might lead to a notable increase in wave transmission under short incident waves in fig 12 f notable overtopping mass of water but relatively insignificant seepage flux interaction is observed a moderate value of p 1 i e 0 125 shows superior efficiency under moderate and short incident waves a relatively large value of p 1 i e 0 18 dilutes the breakwater s interaction with waves as shown in figs 12 c and d and results in an increase in wave transmission by approximately 20 or more as high as 50 under 2 k h 4 compared with that of the p 1 0 125 case for wave reflection the low porosity of the upper plate increases the c r values especially under short incident waves as observed in fig 11 b generally a smaller value of p 1 is favorable for energy dissipation under long waves but results in the opposite effect under short waves as shown in fig 11 c a p 1 of 0 05 appears to be too small to dissipate wave energy under 3 k h 8 and results in both greater wave reflections and larger transmitted wave amplitudes the effect on the vertical wave force is relatively less conspicuous a small value of p 1 only increases the c f z values under k h 4 or k h 6 moreover it is expected to further improve the overall wave dissipation performance via optimization of the porosity of each plate 4 4 effect of submerged depth for models no 5 and no 9 two sets of different submerged depths were tested and the results are shown in fig 13 the right portion of each sub figure shows the relative difference compared with the values of model no 5 model no 9 has a larger submerged depth for the upper plate d 1 5 cm a uniform layer spacing of 10 cm and the lower plate is located deeper than that of model no 5 as demonstrated in figs 13 a and b moderately expanding the submerged depths increases the wave transmission and diminishes the reflected wave amplitudes however only slight differences are observed in terms of wave energy dissipation see fig 13 c moderate alteration of the submerged depth minimally affects the energy dissipating performance but shifts the proportion of reflection and transmission the hydrodynamic load on the breakwater remains nearly the same except under short incident waves k h 6 as illustrated in fig 13 d generally a breakwater of the submerged horizontal plate type exhibits good adaptability to the water level in engineering practice and a proper submerged depth of the upper plate and a relatively small spacing between the upper and the second plates might be favorable to wave blocking performance 4 5 effect of incident wave height in the tests performance under different incident wave heights i e 2 cm 4 cm and 6 cm was examined the results reveal several non linear characteristics of the breakwater which primarily result from the non linearity of the free surface and the plate porosity figure 14 shows the results of regular wave tests of model no 5 with four layer porous plates under h 2 cm 4 cm and 6 cm and the result from the white noise wave test the regular wave result of h 2 cm is generally consistent with that of the white noise wave test although slightly larger c t values of white noise wave are observed especially under 2 k h 4 this discrepancy is probably correlated with the induced higher harmonic waves which are not filtered out during processing of the results of white noise tests the c r values of white noise waves show certain oscillating behaviour in that several local peaks of c r values exist at certain k h instead of decreasing monotonously as k h increases this result agrees well with the result of the h 2 cm cases the same tendency is manifested in the results of the h 4 cm and 6 cm cases probably due to the resonance of fluid motion between horizontal plates as shown in fig 14 a a moderately increased incident wave height i e h increased from 2 cm to 4 cm lowers the wave transmission under k h 3 because of fiercer interaction with long waves as observed in fig 15 a but has the opposite effect under k h 3 which is mainly due to the increased shoaling effect and overtopping mass under shorter incident waves as shown in fig 15 b further increase in the incident wave height e g to 6 cm enhances the wave transmission for nearly the entire range of incident wave lengths due to the shoaling effect and the overtopping mass of water on the breakwater in comparison between fig 16 a h 4 cm and fig 16 b h 6 cm at k h 2 94 the overtopping mass increases notably as the incident wave height increases for wave reflection as shown in fig 14 b increasing the incident wave height usually leads to larger reflected wave amplitude especially under moderate wavelengths of 3 k h 5 combining the effect on wave transmission and reflection a larger incident wave height usually weakens the wave dissipating efficiency of the breakwater except for the cases under long incident waves k h around 2 of h 4 cm mainly due to the non linearity of the plate porosity e g vertex shedding and high order relationships between the seepage velocity and corresponding pressure loss etc furthermore the vertical wave force increases as the incident wave height increases in addition fig 17 shows the wave transmission coefficients of model no 6 9 under regular waves of h 2 cm and 4 cm as observed in figs 17 a c the wave blocking performances of breakwaters with different p 1 show different tendencies as the incident wave height increases for a breakwater of p 1 0 18 as shown in fig 17 a the wave transmission of 4 cm height regular waves is decreased under relatively long incident waves k h 5 compared with that of the case h 2 cm which is mainly due to enhanced interaction between incident waves and the upper plate as shown in fig 18 a for a breakwater of p 1 0 05 however the wave dissipating efficiency of the upper plate is enhanced under moderate and short incident waves k h 3 of h 4 cm see fig 18 b resulting lower c t values as illustrated in fig 17 c however no significant difference is noted in the wave transmission between the two incident wave heights for the breakwater with p 1 0 08 as shown in fig 17 b this result implies that high porosity enhances the non linearity between seepage velocity and pressure loss under long incident waves whereas low porosity makes that under moderate and short waves more significant for model no 9 wave blocking performance similar to that of model no 5 is observed whereas the transmitted wave amplitude of h 4 cm increases more significantly under k h 4 which indicates that expanding submerged depth enhances the non linearity related to mass overtopping 5 conclusions this paper proposes a submerged breakwater with four layer horizontal porous plates the vertical velocity distribution of fluid particles and suggestions from previous studies were considered in the design of the breakwater s geometrical parameters i e plate submergence porosity and width the wave dissipating characteristics i e the wave reflection transmission energy dissipation and vertical force coefficients were examined in a series of experiments the effects of layer number breakwater width porosity of the upper plate and incident wave height were investigated it can be observed that the efficiency under long incident waves k h around 2 is improved by adding the lower plates compared with that of the conventional single or double layer ones generally the four layer breakwater proposed in the current paper shows satisfactory performance under a wide range of incident wavelengths and has a promising future in coastal engineering applications the increase of layer number and breakwater width can deliver improvement in dissipation of long incident waves and the breakwater width displays a more significant influence the performance under long incident waves can also be enhanced by reducing the upper plate porosity however layer spacing between the upper and the second layer or upper plate porosity that are too small might increase transmitted waves of high frequency moderate alteration of submerged depth of each layer shifts the proportion of energy reflected or transmitted but minimally affects the energy dissipating performance for a multi layer breakwater of a specified width further improvement in overall performance is expected via an optimized design of the porosity and submergence of each layer with consideration of the mutual effect of adjacent plates furthermore the performance under different incident wave heights shows certain non linear characteristics of the horizontal plates in general increasing incident wave height increases both the energy dissipation and mass overtopping the former takes effect primarily under long incident waves whereas the latter becomes predominant under waves of high frequency or with notably large steepness additionally the porosity of the upper plate and plate submergence also make difference and detailed mechanism of these non linear phenomena warrants further study acknowledgments the authors acknowledge support from the national natural science foundation of china grant

23605,this paper proposes a four layer submerged horizontal porous plate breakwater to improve the wave dissipation efficiency under a wide range of incident wave frequencies especially long incident waves and also discusses the design of the geometrical parameters i e plate submergence and porosity the breakwater performance was examined experimentally in a two dimensional wave flume the effects of the layer number breakwater width upper plate porosity and incident wave height were compared increasing the layer number and breakwater width or reducing the upper plate porosity can be favorable to energy dissipation for long incident waves a moderate alteration of the submerged depth of each layer shifts the proportion of energy reflected or transmitted but minimally affects the energy dissipation performance in addition the incident wave height affects both energy dissipation and mass overtopping and the combined effect is related to the incident wave frequency and steepness generally the proposed four layer breakwater demonstrates satisfactory performance under a wide range of incident wavelengths and has promising future applications in coastal engineering an optimized design for the plate porosity and submergence can be expected to further improve the breakwater performance and a detailed mechanism for non linear wave interactions with the submerged horizontal porous plate warrants further study keywords breakwater horizontal porous plate multi layer submerged experiment energy dissipation 1 introduction as an economical and ecologically friendly wave dissipation and coastal protection structure the horizontal porous plate breakwater offers advantages over those of caisson rubble mound and vertical wall types yu 2002 liu et al 2008 in contrast to conventional bottom mounded breakwaters a horizontal plate breakwater type can be designed as floating or pile supported type which is less dependent on bad sea conditions and water depths furthermore horizontal plates can avoid heavy horizontal wave force impacting on the structure and the porosity further reduces the vertical force and attenuates additional wave energy however the wave dissipating performance of the horizontal plate type breakwater is largely influenced by its submergence and geometry parameters i e plate width and porosity therefore research on wave interaction with horizontal porous plates is needed to predict the performance and optimize the design for engineering applications the submerged horizontal plate was proposed as a breakwater in the 1970s hattori 1975 siew and hurley 1977 hattori and matsumoto 1977 and since then its characteristics i e coefficients of wave reflection transmission energy dissipation and vertical force related to variations of plate width submerged depth and incident wavelength have been widely investigated several early investigations into the fully submerged solid horizontal plate e g the maximal reflection and the minimal transmission problem by patarapanich 1984 and patarapanich and cheong 1989 the effect of moorings on the total reflection and total transmission coefficients of a moored horizontal plate by mciver 1985 and the ability to reflect short incident waves by liu and iskandarani 1991 revealed several limitations of the horizontal solid plate when used as a breakwater the solid plate has little to no effect on attenuation of wave energy mostly by breaking scattered waves over the plate and inducing vortices at the plate tips see e g dick and brebner 1969 patarapanich and cheong 1989 yu et al 1995 brossard and chagdali 2001 incident waves in a specific frequency band which is usually relatively narrow can be blocked and reflected and waves that propagate into the lee side might cause resonance in the sheltered area and degrade sailing conditions therefore a breakwater with porous plates was proposed and its wave dissipating performance is enhanced by porosity induced vortices yu and chwang 1994 chwang and wu 1994 yip and chwang 1998 yu and chwang 1994 suggested that the proper porosity could maintain the wave transmission at a low level while suppressing the wave reflection and the vertical force on the plate and an investigation into the wave interaction with a periodic pitching porous plate by yip and chwang 1998 indicated a similar conclusion cho and kim 2000 considered the hydroelastic effect of a horizontal porous flexible membrane on wave blocking performance under monochromatic incident waves for a membrane of relatively small width greater flexibility leads to better wave blocking performance whereas for a relatively wide membrane increasing the flexibility worsen the performance except under notably long and short waves in addition the study also indicated that a membrane of larger size does not necessarily produce better performance the wave dissipating performance of a submerged inclined plate breakwater was investigated analytically by cho and kim 2008 and examined experimentally by rao et al 2009 a porous plate of the proper inclination angle near the free surface is favorable to performance cho and kim 2013 investigated the interaction of oblique monochromatic incident waves with a submerged horizontal porous plate and indicated that a plate porosity value near 0 1 and a submerged depth near 0 05 h 0 1 h might be optimal for the performance where h is the water depth nonetheless only one layer of the submerged plate might not create sufficient efficiency under large variations of the tidal level or a wide range of incident wave frequencies the twin plate breakwater which consists of a horizontal surface plate and a submerged plate located immediately below the surface plate was investigated analytically by usha and gayathri 2005 and experimentally by neelamani and gayathri 2006 although wave transmission can be greatly reduced by the breakwater with a surface plate the wave reflection is quite significant additionally liu et al 2008 analytically examined a double layer submerged horizontal plate breakwater with an upper porous plate and a lower solid plate and indicated that the proper porosity of the upper plate can aid in suppressing the vertical force on both layers at a relatively low level and the efficiency could be further enhanced by making the lower plate permeable as well more recently wave interaction with double layer submerged horizontal porous plates was investigated by cho et al 2013 and liu and li 2014 based on both numerical solutions and experimental results and the effect of plate submergence and porosity was discussed the results from cho et al 2013 indicated that the contribution of the lower plate to wave dissipation might be weakened if the spacing between the two plates exceeds 10 of the water depth this result implied that a limitation of the covered water depth exists for a double layer horizontal plate breakwater and its efficiency in dissipating long incident waves the energy of which propagate more deeply therefore one solution is to increase the layer number a breakwater that consists of a stack of horizontal solid plates has been proposed wang and shen 1999 wang et al 2006 wang and shen 1999 suggested that the spacing between layers should be relatively small to improve the multi layer breakwater s performance and the related experimental study conducted by wang et al 2006 demonstrated that the upright wave force acting on the solid plate is relatively strong however investigations into the wave dissipating performance of a multi layer submerged horizontal porous plate breakwater are not yet found in the published literature this paper proposes a four layer submerged horizontal porous plate breakwater the addition of the lower two plates is intended to improve the performance under long incident waves with properly designed plate porosity improvement in wave dissipation can be achieved while suppressing the vertical wave force the performance of the proposed breakwater was examined using physical model tests in a two dimensional wave flume the following section discusses the design of the geometrical parameters i e submergence and porosity of plates the third section describes the experiment setup and the details of test cases the experimental results of specific characteristics i e the effect of layer number plate width porosity and submergence are shown and discussed thereafter the final section illustrates the conclusions 2 design of the breakwater the horizontal porous plate plays a role in attenuating the incident wave energy by obstructing the vertical motion of fluid particles inducing vortices and breaking scattered waves over the plate the vertical velocity distribution of fluid particles makes a significant difference in the wave dissipation efficiency hence the fluid velocity distribution should be taken into consideration in breakwater design considering the inviscid and incompressible water and irrotational flow in a two dimensional domain x o z of which the origin is set on the free surface the velocity potential ϕ of the monochromatic propagating wave can be written as eq 1 based on the linear wave theory 1 ϕ g a ω cosh k z h cosh k h sin k x ω t where g is the gravitational acceleration a is the incident wave amplitude h is the constant water depth ω and k denote the incident wave frequency and wave number respectively x and z are spatial coordinates and t is time the velocity amplitude of fluid particles along the submerged depth can be described as 2 u a g k ω cosh k z h cosh k h 3 v a g k ω sinh k z h cosh k h where u and v denote the amplitudes of the horizontal and vertical velocity respectively figure 1 shows the variation of vertical velocity component with submerged depth under four different incident wave numbers the dimensionless wave numbers k h 1 0 8 0 in which the vertical velocity is normalized by that on the free surface v z 0 the vertical velocity drops swiftly as the submerged depth increases under relatively short incident waves whereas under longer incident waves relatively significant amplitudes can be maintained in deeper water a relatively small submergence of the upper plate and spacing between the upper and the second plates are favorable to the breakwater s efficiency however submerged depths of these two plates that are too small might render the breakwater too sensitive to water level changes e g tides furthermore the submerged depth of the lower plate must be considered to maintain the efficiency under relatively long incident waves compared with an optimized design of the double layer breakwater suggested in cho et al 2013 d 1 h 0 1 and d 2 h 0 2 as shown in fig 2 a the four layer breakwater as shown in fig 2 b has a relatively small submerged depth for the upper plate but maintains adequate extension of the covered water depth this design makes the four layer breakwater not only efficient at the designed water level but also more adaptive in the case of tidal variation for an incident wave of k h 1 the vertical velocity of fluid particles at a depth of 0 4 h decreases to less than 60 of that on the free surface and the corresponding kinetic energy decreases to approximately 30 because of the square relation hence plates located deeper than 40 of the water depth have a minimal benefit on the wave dissipating efficiency therefore in the current design of the four layer breakwater the submerged depth of the upper plate d 1 was set at 0 05 h and that of the lower plate was set at 0 4 h the middle two plates were located at depths of 0 125 h and 0 25 h respectively the plate porosity is another parameter that must be determined because it affects the energy attenuating efficiency as well as the hydrodynamic force acting on the plate research by liu et al 2008 suggested that the dimensionless porous effect parameter g in the range from 10 1 to 10 0 is proper for the upper plate additionally the porosity p of 0 1 0 2 is implied as optimal for the horizontal porous plate see cho and kim 2013 cho et al 2013 liu and li 2014 considering the above two points and based on the empirical formula g 57 63 p 0 9717 2 π see cho and kim 2008 the plate porosity in the current design was set at p 0 125 g 0 992 correspondingly 3 experimental setup the physical model tests were conducted in the two dimensional wave flume located at the state key laboratory of ocean engineering shanghai jiao tong university china the wave flume is 14 m long 1 m wide and 1 2 m deep with a flap type wave maker installed at one end and a slope wave absorber installed at the other end as shown in fig 3 the water depth was set to 0 8 m in the tests the physical model consisted of an aluminum frame and a certain number of porous plates with uniform circular holes these plates were 2 mm in thickness mounted horizontally on the frame and also supported by four slender columns in the middle to reinforce the stiffness as shown in fig 4 the frame was fixed to an installation beam above the middle of the flume using four three component force transducers the geometrical details of each model are listed in table 1 in which p j and d j denote the porosity and submerged depth of the plate j respectively and n is the layer number models of two widths 0 45 m and 0 60 m were tested and compared to examine the effect of layer number breakwaters of 0 45 m width with two four and eight layers of horizontal porous plates and breakwaters of 0 60 m width with two and four layers were tested additionally for four layer breakwaters of 0 60 m width different porosities of the upper plate p 1 0 05 0 08 0 125 and 0 18 and two sets of plate submergences d j 0 04 m 0 10 m 0 20 m 0 32 m and d j 0 05 m 0 15 m 0 25 m 0 35 m were tested regular waves of two heights h 2 cm and 4 cm were applied in the tests for each wave height nineteen different periods varying from 0 6 s to 1 5 s at an interval of 0 05 s were generated the corresponding dimensionless wave numbers k h ranged between 8 95 and 1 56 additionally in the cases of model no 5 another regular wave height of 6 cm with periods in the range of 0 8 1 5 s and a white noise wave were applied the time history of the white noise wave elevation and its spectrum are shown in fig 5 wave crest heights are moderate and there is no blank frequency band in the spectrum because what matters in the experiment is the ratio of the reflected or transmitted wave amplitudes to the incident wave amplitudes the white noise wave is qualified for the test despite the difference between measured and target spectrum in the low and high frequency parts to discriminate the incident reflected and transmitted components from the measured time histories of wave elevation the three point method developed by mansard and funke 1980 was applied in the tests this method offers the advantages of excellent robustness under a wide range of incident wave frequencies and insensitivity to probe spacing and signal noise six wave probes were used with three located upstream of the model numbered from 1 to 3 and the others located downstream numbered from 4 to 6 according to the suggestion from mansard and funke 1980 the spacing between adjacent wave probes was set to 0 15 m and 0 22 m respectively to eliminate singularities for regular wave tests the amplitude and phase difference of the fundamental wave at each wave probe position written as complex numbers ζ n n 1 2 6 were estimated by the fft fast fourier transform technique with a hann window and an interpolation algorithm developed by andria et al 1989 using the interpolation algorithm in andria et al 1989 the amplitude and phase angle of measured signal can be obtained with sufficient accuracy even when sampling time is relatively short this compensates the limitation of data length in the long wave cases the phase angles of the wave records at probe no 1 and no 4 were given as zero because only the wave dissipating coefficients related to fundamental waves were of interest in the current study higher harmonics induced by the submerged horizontal plates were not considered during the data processing and were filtered out the equation set in which the incident and reflected components a i and a r respectively are involved can be written as follows 4 a i a r ε 1 ζ 1 a i e i k x 2 x 1 a r e i k x 2 x 1 ε 2 ζ 2 a i e i k x 3 x 1 a r e i k x 3 x 1 ε 3 ζ 3 where ε n n 1 2 3 denotes the uncertainty of measurement of probe no n x n denotes the coordinate of probe no n and a i and a r are complex numbers that represent both the amplitudes and phase angles of the incident wave and the reflected wave respectively in the experiment x 2 x 1 0 15 m and x 3 x 1 0 37 m using the least squares method see mansard and funke 1980 the values of a i and a r were obtained the incident wave height h i and reflected wave height h r were given by h i 2 a i and h r 2 a r the transmitted wave height h t was obtained similarly based on the measured wave records of probes no 4 6 the amplitudes of total horizontal and vertical wave forces f x and f z respectively were obtained by the four three component force transducers and the fft technique consequently the parameters of the breakwater s wave dissipating performance including wave transmission coefficient c t reflection coefficient c r energy dissipation coefficient c d horizontal force coefficient c f x and vertical force coefficient c f z which are elements of interest in the tests and also in engineering practice can be obtained as follows 5 c t h t h i 6 c r h r h i 7 c d 1 c t 2 c r 2 8 c f x f x ρ g h i w b 9 c f z f z ρ g h i w b where ρ is the density of water and b is the flume width for the white noise wave tests the technique described above was applied to each frequency band the amplitude and phase difference were obtained by auto and cross spectral density analyses respectively and the necessary spectral smoothing was applied to reduce erratic variations of the spectrum 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of layer number the sub figures in fig 6 show comparisons of the wave transmission reflection energy dissipation and vertical force coefficients of the 0 45 m wide breakwaters with two four and eight layers models no 1 3 respectively the right portion of each sub figure represents the corresponding relative differences compared with the values of the two layer case with values given in percent the performances of the 0 6 m wide breakwaters with two and four layers models no 4 and no 5 respectively are illustrated in the sub figures of fig 7 additionally the horizontal wave force coefficients of these breakwaters are shown in fig 8 generally the multi layer submerged horizontal porous plate breakwater exhibits good efficiency in dissipation of incident waves wave reflection and transmission can be suppressed at a relatively low level and satisfactory wave energy dissipating efficiency is achieved under a wide range of incident wave lengths the total vertical wave forces are within reasonable limits and the total horizontal forces are even an order of magnitude lower than the vertical forces as shown in fig 8 which is a significant advantage in terms of safety however the breakwater becomes less efficient when the incident wavelength increases in addition to the increase in wave reflection the wave transmission and total force increase more significantly as well for the two layer breakwater that is 0 45 m wide c t exceeds 0 5 under k h 2 indicating inefficiency in blocking long incident waves improvement in the efficiency of blocking long incident waves can be achieved by adding additional submerged plates for a breakwater of 0 45 m width the wave transmission coefficient under k h 3 is reduced by approximately 10 15 in the four layer case and by approximately 20 in the eight layer case compared with that in the two layer case a greater amount of wave energy is attenuated under long incident waves although c r increases slightly for breakwaters with additional layers the total vertical wave force increases by less than 30 when the layer number doubles e g comparing the c f z values of the four layer case with those of the two layer one and the increase in c f x is moderate approximately 30 60 when the layer number doubles however under moderate and short incident waves e g k h 3 the c t values increase slightly as the layer number increases which is likely correlated with that the energy attenuating effect on shorter waves is weakened because of smaller spacing between the upper and the second plates the difference in c r and in c f z as well as in c f x between breakwaters of different layer numbers tends to vanish moreover the spacing between layers of the eight layer breakwater appears too small to maintain its efficiency in dissipating short waves and c t values under k h 4 increase significantly a similar trend is observed in the cases with 0 6 m width whereas the improvement in performance is more notable when the layer number increases the c r values of the four layer breakwater are reduced by approximately 20 40 under k h 3 compared with those of the two layer counterpart illustrating a remarkable increase in wave energy dissipation efficiency because of small magnitude of the horizontal wave force it will not be concerned in the following discussions 4 2 effect of plate width for models no 1 and no 4 breakwaters with the same porosity p 0 125 for each layer number of layers two layers and submerged depth d j 4 cm 16 cm but different plate widths w 0 45 m and 0 60 m were tested to examine the effect of plate width the measured values of c t c r c d and c f z are shown in fig 9 together with the corresponding relative differences compared with the values of w 0 45 m in addition a comparison between different plate widths in the four layer case i e models no 2 and no 5 is shown in fig 10 in both the two and four layer cases increasing the plate width can improve the wave dissipating performance and suppress both wave reflection and transmission especially under 2 k h 4 because of the diffraction effect of long incident waves additional wave energy can be trapped by a breakwater with a larger width and the transmission coefficient displays a more rapid drop when the incident wavelength diminishes the c t values of the 0 6 m wide breakwater are reduced by approximately 40 60 and the c r values are reduced by approximately 30 50 under 2 k h 4 compared with the results from the 0 45 m wide breakwater in general a breakwater with 0 6 m width exhibits a better ability to dissipate incident waves of 2 k h 4 the four layer breakwater with 0 6 m width shows even better performance than that of the eight layer breakwater with 0 45 m width see the results of model no 3 in fig 6 which implies that increasing the plate width can offer more direct and notable improvement in the wave dissipating performance of the horizontal plate breakwater in addition in terms of the wave load the breakwater with 0 6 m width shows smaller c f z values as well as c f x values see fig 8 indicating that the total wave force might not increase significantly as the plate width increases however the difference in the wave dissipating performance becomes insignificant under k h 5 as shown in figs 10 a and c implying that the advantage of a wider breakwater tends to vanish under short waves and that a plate width that is too large might be unnecessary under certain prevailing wave climates 4 3 effect of plate porosity for models no 5 8 different porosities of the upper plate p 1 0 125 0 18 0 08 and 0 05 were tested in the context of the four layer breakwater and the results are shown in fig 11 relative differences compared with the values of model no 5 p 1 0 125 are shown in the right portion of each sub figure and snapshots of models no 5 6 and 8 in waves of h 2 cm are shown in fig 12 it can be observed that the porosity of the upper plate significantly influences the wave blocking performance lower porosity can benefit the wave blocking performance under long incident waves as shown in fig 11 a p 1 of 0 08 or 0 05 results in favorable efficiency for suppression of long wave transmission in comparison with the breakwater of p 1 0 125 fig 12 a p 1 of 0 05 fig 12 e enhances the disturbance of the wave field significantly under long incident waves for short waves however lowering the porosity of the upper plate has the opposite effect a value of p 1 that is too small e g 0 05 might lead to a notable increase in wave transmission under short incident waves in fig 12 f notable overtopping mass of water but relatively insignificant seepage flux interaction is observed a moderate value of p 1 i e 0 125 shows superior efficiency under moderate and short incident waves a relatively large value of p 1 i e 0 18 dilutes the breakwater s interaction with waves as shown in figs 12 c and d and results in an increase in wave transmission by approximately 20 or more as high as 50 under 2 k h 4 compared with that of the p 1 0 125 case for wave reflection the low porosity of the upper plate increases the c r values especially under short incident waves as observed in fig 11 b generally a smaller value of p 1 is favorable for energy dissipation under long waves but results in the opposite effect under short waves as shown in fig 11 c a p 1 of 0 05 appears to be too small to dissipate wave energy under 3 k h 8 and results in both greater wave reflections and larger transmitted wave amplitudes the effect on the vertical wave force is relatively less conspicuous a small value of p 1 only increases the c f z values under k h 4 or k h 6 moreover it is expected to further improve the overall wave dissipation performance via optimization of the porosity of each plate 4 4 effect of submerged depth for models no 5 and no 9 two sets of different submerged depths were tested and the results are shown in fig 13 the right portion of each sub figure shows the relative difference compared with the values of model no 5 model no 9 has a larger submerged depth for the upper plate d 1 5 cm a uniform layer spacing of 10 cm and the lower plate is located deeper than that of model no 5 as demonstrated in figs 13 a and b moderately expanding the submerged depths increases the wave transmission and diminishes the reflected wave amplitudes however only slight differences are observed in terms of wave energy dissipation see fig 13 c moderate alteration of the submerged depth minimally affects the energy dissipating performance but shifts the proportion of reflection and transmission the hydrodynamic load on the breakwater remains nearly the same except under short incident waves k h 6 as illustrated in fig 13 d generally a breakwater of the submerged horizontal plate type exhibits good adaptability to the water level in engineering practice and a proper submerged depth of the upper plate and a relatively small spacing between the upper and the second plates might be favorable to wave blocking performance 4 5 effect of incident wave height in the tests performance under different incident wave heights i e 2 cm 4 cm and 6 cm was examined the results reveal several non linear characteristics of the breakwater which primarily result from the non linearity of the free surface and the plate porosity figure 14 shows the results of regular wave tests of model no 5 with four layer porous plates under h 2 cm 4 cm and 6 cm and the result from the white noise wave test the regular wave result of h 2 cm is generally consistent with that of the white noise wave test although slightly larger c t values of white noise wave are observed especially under 2 k h 4 this discrepancy is probably correlated with the induced higher harmonic waves which are not filtered out during processing of the results of white noise tests the c r values of white noise waves show certain oscillating behaviour in that several local peaks of c r values exist at certain k h instead of decreasing monotonously as k h increases this result agrees well with the result of the h 2 cm cases the same tendency is manifested in the results of the h 4 cm and 6 cm cases probably due to the resonance of fluid motion between horizontal plates as shown in fig 14 a a moderately increased incident wave height i e h increased from 2 cm to 4 cm lowers the wave transmission under k h 3 because of fiercer interaction with long waves as observed in fig 15 a but has the opposite effect under k h 3 which is mainly due to the increased shoaling effect and overtopping mass under shorter incident waves as shown in fig 15 b further increase in the incident wave height e g to 6 cm enhances the wave transmission for nearly the entire range of incident wave lengths due to the shoaling effect and the overtopping mass of water on the breakwater in comparison between fig 16 a h 4 cm and fig 16 b h 6 cm at k h 2 94 the overtopping mass increases notably as the incident wave height increases for wave reflection as shown in fig 14 b increasing the incident wave height usually leads to larger reflected wave amplitude especially under moderate wavelengths of 3 k h 5 combining the effect on wave transmission and reflection a larger incident wave height usually weakens the wave dissipating efficiency of the breakwater except for the cases under long incident waves k h around 2 of h 4 cm mainly due to the non linearity of the plate porosity e g vertex shedding and high order relationships between the seepage velocity and corresponding pressure loss etc furthermore the vertical wave force increases as the incident wave height increases in addition fig 17 shows the wave transmission coefficients of model no 6 9 under regular waves of h 2 cm and 4 cm as observed in figs 17 a c the wave blocking performances of breakwaters with different p 1 show different tendencies as the incident wave height increases for a breakwater of p 1 0 18 as shown in fig 17 a the wave transmission of 4 cm height regular waves is decreased under relatively long incident waves k h 5 compared with that of the case h 2 cm which is mainly due to enhanced interaction between incident waves and the upper plate as shown in fig 18 a for a breakwater of p 1 0 05 however the wave dissipating efficiency of the upper plate is enhanced under moderate and short incident waves k h 3 of h 4 cm see fig 18 b resulting lower c t values as illustrated in fig 17 c however no significant difference is noted in the wave transmission between the two incident wave heights for the breakwater with p 1 0 08 as shown in fig 17 b this result implies that high porosity enhances the non linearity between seepage velocity and pressure loss under long incident waves whereas low porosity makes that under moderate and short waves more significant for model no 9 wave blocking performance similar to that of model no 5 is observed whereas the transmitted wave amplitude of h 4 cm increases more significantly under k h 4 which indicates that expanding submerged depth enhances the non linearity related to mass overtopping 5 conclusions this paper proposes a submerged breakwater with four layer horizontal porous plates the vertical velocity distribution of fluid particles and suggestions from previous studies were considered in the design of the breakwater s geometrical parameters i e plate submergence porosity and width the wave dissipating characteristics i e the wave reflection transmission energy dissipation and vertical force coefficients were examined in a series of experiments the effects of layer number breakwater width porosity of the upper plate and incident wave height were investigated it can be observed that the efficiency under long incident waves k h around 2 is improved by adding the lower plates compared with that of the conventional single or double layer ones generally the four layer breakwater proposed in the current paper shows satisfactory performance under a wide range of incident wavelengths and has a promising future in coastal engineering applications the increase of layer number and breakwater width can deliver improvement in dissipation of long incident waves and the breakwater width displays a more significant influence the performance under long incident waves can also be enhanced by reducing the upper plate porosity however layer spacing between the upper and the second layer or upper plate porosity that are too small might increase transmitted waves of high frequency moderate alteration of submerged depth of each layer shifts the proportion of energy reflected or transmitted but minimally affects the energy dissipating performance for a multi layer breakwater of a specified width further improvement in overall performance is expected via an optimized design of the porosity and submergence of each layer with consideration of the mutual effect of adjacent plates furthermore the performance under different incident wave heights shows certain non linear characteristics of the horizontal plates in general increasing incident wave height increases both the energy dissipation and mass overtopping the former takes effect primarily under long incident waves whereas the latter becomes predominant under waves of high frequency or with notably large steepness additionally the porosity of the upper plate and plate submergence also make difference and detailed mechanism of these non linear phenomena warrants further study acknowledgments the authors acknowledge support from the national natural science foundation of china grant

23606,for solving the trajectory tracking problem of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system uvms in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and time varying external disturbances this paper presents an indirect adaptive control scheme which consists of three parts an extended kalman filter ekf estimation compensative system a model based computed torque controller ctc a h robust compensative tracking controller the contribution of our method is that it can overcome the disadvantages of existing control schemes which are based on the accurate dynamic model of uvms known

controlling the nonlinear uvms keywords indirect adaptive control extended kalman filter ekf computed torque controller ctc h infinity robust controller underwater vehicle manipulator system uvms 1 introduction underwater vehicle manipulator system uvms is an important equipment which can complete tasks such as deep sea exploration and operation offshore oil production military applications etc when various tasks are performed using an uvms it becomes important to control the position of an end effector accurately in general an inverse kinematics analysis is done to determine the desired vehicle joints trajectories of an uvms based on the given trajectory of an end effector the uvms inverse kinematic redundancy resolution which can be adopted to avoid the singularity and also used to determine the task priority during working is not this literature research emphasis detailed inverse kinematics introduction can refer to gianluca antonelli 2013 kim et al 2015a b works our literature focuses on the given kinematic trajectories tracking control problem obtaining the dynamic model of uvms is the first step to make effective trajectory tracking control however it is very difficult to get the accurate model of uvms in practical engineering application it is generally required to do some reasonable approximate treatment and even ignore some uncertainties in dynamic modeling also the working environment of uvms is varying which makes uvms disturbed by many external disturbances e g underwater currents in a word uvms will be disturbed by a variety of disturbances which comes from itself and the working environment in addition the sensory noises will make the system states used for feedback control difficult to measure in the real working system e g actuator displacement velocity measurements which is also another hard problem for the uvms control overall uvms task operations will involve parameter uncertainties sensor noises and external disturbances which requires a more robust control system to be able to compensate for them as these kinds of uncertainties and disturbances may cause the decline of the control system quality and even system instability several control schemes appear in literatures the pid controller is one of the most commonly used technics to control underwater robot its advantage is the simplicity of designing see yoerger et al 1990 plotnik and rock 2005 maurya et al 2006 fossen 1994 however it has been verified that the pid controller can only provide a relatively accurate and rapid set point regulation i e station keeping when the plant is linear and the disturbances are constant smallwood and whitcomb 2004 for the process of trajectory tracking the pid just has the quick response but a terrible tracking precision even in a linear second order plant subsequently variable structure robust approaches for the control problem of underwater robots or manipulators are springing up such as sliding mode control smc see demirci and kerestecioğlu 2004 soylu et al 2008 bessa et al 2010 kim et al 2015a b terminal sliding mode control tsmc shuanghe yu et al 2005 elmokadem et al 2016 feng et al 2002 2013 neila and tarak 2011 zou et al 2011 wang and sun 2012 these methods have received great attention their advantages are simplicity robustness against model uncertainties and external disturbances and guaranteed transient performance however these controllers have two major disadvantages the first is that they have a slower convergence to the equilibrium when the system state is far away from the equilibrium and the second is the singularity problem also the smc based approaches have to make high frequency chattering with unavoidablely large magnitude around the sliding surface to eliminate unknowns and achieve the robustness for further improving the robustness of the underwater robot control system against dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances control methods which are independent of accurate robot dynamic model appear e g the adaptive control designed on the particular underwater robot structure and applications antonelli et al 2001 wang and lee 2003 mohan and kim 2012 li and lee 2005a 2005b makavita et al 2015 do 2015 rezazadegan et al 2015 maalouf et al 2015 shojaei and arefi 2015 the adaptive backsteping control based on a recursive design procedure lapierre et al 2003 li and lee 2005a 2005b do 2013 2015 wang et al 2015 the fuzzy logical control based on the expert systems akkizidis et al 2003 wang and lee 2003 ishaque et al 2011 teo et al 2012 khodayari and balochian 2015 and the neural network control based on the data training zuo et al 2010 wang and lee 2003 li and lee 2005b kim et al 2015a b shojaei and arefi 2015 wang et al 2015 kim and kim 2015 these controllers can provide suitable performance and stability results in both theory and simulation but the transient responses of the tracking errors can not be satisfactory in the design somehow once it happens i e a sensors measurement with non gaussian noises or in a bias since sensors give an exact view of the control process actuators implement controller action to meet the design requirements once the noises bias either in the sensor or in the actuator exists although the controller is robust against modeling parametric uncertainties and external disturbances the process performance will still not be good if the controller is designed with fault tolerance then there s no doubt that it can get optimal performance in the uvms b the external disturbance changes with non gaussian unknown distribution randomly and or violently in the last decade the approach of h optimal control has been well known for its robustness and capability of disturbance attenuation in nonlinear system see kim and lewis 2002 kung and chen 2007 xie and su 1997 shen and tamura 1995 zuo et al 2010 gerasimos rigatos et al 2016 this method s essential is to ensure that the system error is as small as possible in the presence of disturbances its ultimate solution is an optimization problem similar to min u max d 1 e u d 2 where e is the system error d is the disturbances assuming disturbances norm value is less than 1 u the control input the problem can be described as a worst case the disturbance d will maximize the error and then the solution becomes to find an optimal control u to minimize the case error zhou et al 2002 we may have seen that the optimization above is actually a mini max differential game of u and d and the optimal control point is the nash equilibrium point basar and bernhard 1995 basar and olsder 1999 which can be designed to increase the robustness of compensation in the presence of unknown statistics unmodeled dynamics and time varying non gaussian disturbances inspired by the documents above an adaptive controller is proposed in this paper the contribution is that our proposed method can overcome inaccurate dynamic model unknown statistics time varying non gaussian external disturbances sensors measurement bias the proposed controller consists of three parts the first part is an ekf estimation compensative system employed to non fully resist the measuring errors payloads variations unmodeled dynamics and underwater environment disturbances as the ekf hypothesis distribution is limited to gaussian the second part is the model based computed torque control controller ctc which is used to eliminate the effect of the approximation error the third part is the h robust compensative controller designed to achieve the desired trajectory tracking performance which can be used to compensate the ekf estimation system for its inaccurate compensation the proposed designing goal is to improve the stable accurate and fast performances of uvms tracking desired trajectory making uvms optimally resist all kinds of disturbances and uncertainties achieving the normal operation in the working environment the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the

newton euler formulation scheme craig 1986 fossen 1994 is applied to derive dynamic modeling of a uvms the frame of the uvms is shown in fig 1 the dynamic equations of motion of a uvms can be established as follows detailed dynamic modeling of the uvms can be found in gianluca antonelli 2013 schjolberg and fossen 1994 fossen 2011 1 m q q c q q q d q q q g q f q q τ where m q m v q v h t q

effects d q q is hydrodynamic force and damping matrix g q is the restoring forces and moments f v q q and f m q q are the vectors of the coupling dynamic effects due to the manipulator motion for the vehicle and the interaction effects due to the vehicle motion on the manipulator respectively τ is the vector of force moment acting on the vehicle as well as joint torques in a real system it is difficult to get the accurate equation 1 dynamic model due to the uncertainties factors that was not taken into consideration or ignored when modeling there are two main types of uncertainties a parameter s uncertainty such as load arm link quality and its quality centroid length inertia and other geometrical errors b coulomb friction calculation error and sampling delay etc besides uvms will be also affected by outside disturbances such as seawater undercurrent above all we take all the disturbances outside and uncertainties inside as τ d then real environment dynamic model equation of

this research the well known nonlinear filter ekf is designed as an observer to estimate two parts of the uvms i the states vectors of the system used to feedback control as sometimes they are not accurate efficient and practical for measuring by sensors ii the compensation force moment vector acting on the vehicle as well as joint torques which is used to compensate for underwater current

give a more accurate tracking performance and which also can be used to compensate the ekf estimation system for its inaccurate compensation in the next section h robust compensative controller will be designed according to the system lyapunov function candidate overall the proposed controller in our paper consists of three parts the first part is an ekf estimation compensative system employed to non fully resist the unknown statistics measuring errors payloads variations unmodeled dynamics and underwater environment disturbances this method is firstly proposed to the uvms by mohan and kim 2012 as the ekf hypothesis distribution is limited to gaussian for this reason the compensation for non gaussian disturbances is still non fully and biased but it can be used to make an necessarily initial compensation for the uvms laying the foundation for subsequent h robust controller i e reduce the seriousness of the worst case disturbances assumed to the h robust method the second part is the ctc controller which is used to eliminate the effect of the approximation error the underlying idea of this control scheme is to use the existing knowledge of the robot s model to linearize and decouple the robot dofs degrees of freedoms dynamics so that the motion of each dof can be individually controlled using other well developed linear control strategies zuo et al 2010 our ctc designing method is with a pd controller in it so it has the advantage of rapid response however it is used on the inaccurate dynamic model i e exists unmodeled dynamics therefore ctc is also in a biased control which needs a compensation the third part is the h robust compensative controller designed to achieve the desired trajectory accurate tracking performance its design following the minimax h design technique introduced by basar and bernhard 1995 aims at minimizing the system error min u max d 1 e u d 2 prevents the disturbance from trying to maximize it as it is suitable for resisting any unknown statistics disturbances h robust method can consider the differential disturbances i e d m q 1 τ c τ d as a worst case to compensate for the bias from the ekf inaccurate estimation and the ctc action the block diagram that corresponds to the proposed controller is shown in fig 2 the task space end effector goal trajectories are transformed into meaningful desired acceleration velocity and displacement vectors of the system applying the trajectory planner and the inverse kinematics block see gianluca antonelli 2013 kim et al 2015a b the system velocity and displacement tracking errors are calculated using the desired values produced by the inverse kinematics block and the system states feedback values estimated by the ekf block minimax h design technique is used to compensate the ekf and ctc bias 5 h robust compensative controller design and lyapunov stability analysis in order to design the h robust compensative controller feedback linearization technique will be used substitute the adaptive proposed controller equation 15 to dynamic model equation 3 we can get 16 m q e m q v e m q p e m q u τ c τ d let x e e be the state variable then equation 16 can be described as a state space model equation 17 17 e e 0 p i v e e 0 i u 0 i m q 1 τ c τ d let a 0 p i v b 0 i l 0 i then 18 x a x b u l m q 1 τ c τ d here let d m q 1 τ c τ d refer to differential disturbances vector i e the biased value from the ekf compensation and the ctc action for the whole system then we can obtain a closed chain linear tracking error dynamic model equation 19 under the condition of the disturbances 19 x a x b u l d in the h robust control approach a feedback control scheme is designed in the following quadratic objective function 20 j t 1 2 0 t y t t q y t u t t r u t d t t w d t d t q r w 0 y t c x t the significance of the objective function is that the disturbances variable d t tries to maximize the objective function j t while the control signal u t tries to minimize it the physical meaning of the relation given above is that the control signal and the disturbances compete to each other within a mini max differential game gerasimos rigatos et al 2016 qiu 2002 then optimal strategies can be synthesized for both the minimizing and the maximizing players by solving an appropriate riccati differential or difference equation assumption 1 it is assumed that i the energy that is transferred from the disturbances signal d t is bounded that is 0 d t t d t d t ii the matrices a b and a l are stabilizable iii the matrix a c is detectable for given positive definite matrix q r and w there exists a positive definite matrix p obtained from the solution of the riccati equation 21 a t p p a q p 2 b r 1 b t l w 1 l t p then the feedback compensative h robust

which after intermediate operations gives 30 v 1 2 x t q x 1 2 x t p l w 1 l t p x x t p l d or equivalently 31 v 1 2 x t q x 1 2 x t p l w 1 l t p x 1 2 x t p l d 1 2 d t l t p x lemma 1 the

this paper is shown in fig 3 and its detailed parameters are at the end of our paper appendix a and tables 1 3 in our proposed control algorithm performance analysis the tracking performance and effectiveness comparisons between the proposed controller and a few traditional controllers are done it will be demonstrated by tracking the given desired trajectory generated by the inverse kinematics see gianluca antonelli 2013 kim et al 2015a b in 3 different cases below traditional control schemes used to compare in this paper are pid smc sliding mode control and the controller

noises and modeled uncertainties it is impossible to happen in the real working environment however this case can test the proposed algorithm basic tracking performance given a desired trajectory generated by the inverse kinematics figs 5 7 shows the tracking displacement error of the manipulator vehicle and its end effector in the ideal condition respectively without the external disturbances sensory noises and modeled uncertainties associated with the system it is seen that in this ideal condition case performances of all the tracking controllers are good see figs 5 7 as may be expected because of the known dynamics and no any disturbances it is worth to note that there is no big differences in tracking performance between the proposed method and traditional methods elucidated above all in all our proposed method can do as well as the traditional methods in the basic tracking performance case 2 comparative tracking trajectory with constant external disturbances gaussian sensory noises and modeled uncertainties in this case an external disturbances i e ocean current is added to the uvms in the dynamic model the value is a constant vector v 0 2 0 1 0 5 0 3 0 4 0 1 m s in addition uncertain model parameters include the rigid body parameters inertia mass properties and the flexible parameters joint stiffnesses motor and joint viscous friction coefficients are assumed to be affected by 10 sensory noises affect the position and orientation measurements namely a mean gaussian noises of 0 01 m with a standard deviation of 0 01 m for the position measurements and a mean of 0 01 rad with a standard deviation of 0 01 rad for the orientation measurements figs 8 10 shows the tracking displacement error of the manipulator vehicle and its end effector respectively where the disturbances and uncertainties are associated with the system and the plots shows the comparative performance of all the control schemes elucidated above the results show that the proposed controller and mohan kim s method both can be better in adapting to uncertainties and gaussian constant disturbances as the robust controller s expected but pid and smc are in a poor tracking performance it is noted that two methods can both resist uncertainties and gaussian constant disturbances however our proposed method has a faster tracking convergence less chattering for short time tracking than mohan kim s method as shown in fig 8 which is dedicated to the h robust controller for compensating the ekf estimation bias overall the proposed controller and mohan kim s method are both performed well by adapting to uncertainties system dynamic changes and gaussian constant external disturbances however our method has a smaller tracking error and faster convergence and real working environment is not limited to the noises distributed in gaussian and constant ocean current which will be discussed in the case 3 case 3 comparative tracking trajectory with time varying external disturbances non gaussian sensory noises and modeled uncertainties in this case simulated like real working environment an external disturbances i e ocean current is added to the uvms in the dynamic model which are assumed to be governed by 41 v t 0 5 cos 0 1 π t π 5 0 3 cos 0 3 π t π 6 0 4 cos 0 2 π t π 3 0 2 cos 0 4 π t π 5 0 1 cos 0 5 π t π 4 0 5 cos 0 6 π t π 2 0 6 cos 0 3 π t π 5 m s in addition uncertain model parameters are also assumed to be similar to the case2 affected by 10 sensory noises besides standard gaussian noises introduced in case2 are added by sinusoidal wave of 500 hz sampled at the rate of 8000 samples s i e 42 x t p o s i t i o n o r i e n t a t i o n 2 sin 2 π 500 t 8000 v t where v t are gaussian noises described in case2 figs 12 14 shows the tracking displacement error of the manipulator vehicle and its end effector respectively where the worse disturbances and uncertainties than case2 are associated with the system and the plots shows the comparative performance of all the control schemes elucidated above in this case only our proposed scheme is well in adapting to the disturbances because this case is not still in a gaussian constant noises mohan kim s method will not work as the ekf used by mohan kim is only limited to compensate for the gaussian distribution noises for solving this limitation there should be a compensation for the non gaussian bias our proposed h robust compensative controller can just eliminate the biased from the ekf estimation to realize the uvms robust tracking the desired trajectory it is seen that in presence of non gaussian time varying external disturbances and uncertainties our method still has a fast tracking performance and small tracking error as shown in fig 12 our method firstly uses ekf to estimate a coarse value as a compensation for disturbances and uncertainties and then applies h robust controller to compensate for the bias estimation to realize the system robustness so h robust controller s worst case disturbance assumption becomes critical as well as parameters selected in ctc and ekf which are currently decided by practical engineering experience all of these parameters tuning will be our future work for a deep research overall our proposed method can meet the real working environment operation better than the traditional methods elucidated above especially it is well in compensating for the coupling and non gaussian time varying disturbances effects using the initial compensative ekf observer and the final h robust compensative controller in the condition where the non gaussian time varying disturbances and uncertainties associated with the system using our proposed controller the underwater robot has successfully grabbed the target object as shown in the following fig 11 the green line shows theoretical optimal path of forward kinematics grasping object by the end effector the black line represents the end effector actual route results made by our proposed controller we can see that although there is an initial deviation from the desired line but later through the proposed controller uvms is able to regulate until tracking the desired line successful grabbing the target by the end effector 7 conclusion for solving the problem of the nonlinear uvms tracking control with uncertainties and non gaussian time varying disturbances an adaptive controller is proposed and successfully applied to drive an experimental uvms in our proposed scheme main structure is based on the ctc the ekf estimator and h robust controller are compensative controllers embedded in it comparison of 3 cases results indicate that the proposed controller can provide a faster convergence speed better tracking precision less chattering for short time tracking using the compensative ekf estimator and h robust controller than traditional methods overall the proposed controller designed in this paper can provide a feasible method for controlling a nonlinear

23606,for solving the trajectory tracking problem of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system uvms in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and time varying external disturbances this paper presents an indirect adaptive control scheme which consists of three parts an extended kalman filter ekf estimation compensative system a model based computed torque controller ctc a h robust

is shown that the proposed indirect adaptive control scheme can guarantee its embedded h robust controller tracking performance for our uvms simulations show that the proposed control scheme can satisfy the design requirements of uvms in rapid convergence tracking accuracy system stability and disturbance attenuation therefore the method presented in this paper can provide a feasible way of controlling the nonlinear uvms keywords indirect adaptive control extended kalman filter ekf computed torque controller ctc h infinity robust controller underwater vehicle manipulator system uvms 1 introduction underwater vehicle manipulator system uvms is an important equipment which can complete tasks such as deep sea exploration and operation offshore oil production military applications etc when various tasks are performed using an uvms it becomes important to control the position of an end effector accurately in general an inverse kinematics analysis is done to determine the desired vehicle joints trajectories of an uvms based on the given trajectory of an end effector the uvms inverse kinematic redundancy resolution which can be adopted to avoid the singularity and also used to determine the task priority during working is not this literature research emphasis detailed inverse kinematics introduction can refer to gianluca antonelli 2013 kim et al 2015a b works our literature focuses on the given kinematic trajectories tracking control problem obtaining the dynamic model of uvms is the first step to make effective trajectory tracking control however it is very difficult to get the accurate model of uvms in practical engineering application it is generally required to do some reasonable approximate treatment and even ignore some uncertainties in dynamic modeling also the working environment of uvms is varying which makes uvms disturbed by many external disturbances e g underwater currents in a word uvms will be disturbed by a variety of disturbances which comes from itself and the working environment in addition the sensory noises will make the system states used for feedback control difficult to measure in the real working system e g actuator displacement velocity measurements which is also another hard problem for the uvms control overall uvms task operations will involve parameter uncertainties sensor noises and external disturbances which requires a more robust control system to be able to compensate for them as these kinds of uncertainties and disturbances may cause the decline of the control system quality and even system instability several control schemes appear in literatures the pid controller is one of the most commonly used technics to control underwater robot its advantage is the simplicity of designing see yoerger et al 1990 plotnik and rock 2005 maurya et al 2006 fossen 1994 however it has been verified that the pid controller can only provide a relatively accurate and rapid set point regulation i e station keeping when the plant is linear and the disturbances are constant smallwood and whitcomb 2004 for the process of trajectory tracking the pid just has the quick response but a terrible tracking precision even in a linear second order plant subsequently variable structure robust approaches for the control problem of underwater robots or manipulators are springing up such as sliding mode control smc see demirci and kerestecioğlu 2004 soylu et al 2008 bessa et al 2010 kim et al 2015a b terminal sliding mode control tsmc shuanghe yu et al 2005 elmokadem et al 2016 feng et al 2002 2013 neila and tarak 2011 zou et al 2011 wang and sun 2012 these methods have received great attention their advantages are simplicity robustness against model uncertainties and external disturbances and guaranteed transient performance however these controllers have two major disadvantages the first is that they have a slower convergence to the equilibrium when the system state is far away from the equilibrium and the second is the singularity problem also the smc based approaches have to make high frequency chattering with unavoidablely large magnitude around the sliding surface to eliminate unknowns and achieve the robustness for further improving the robustness of the underwater robot control system against dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances control methods which are independent of accurate robot dynamic model appear e g the adaptive control designed on the particular underwater robot structure and applications antonelli et al 2001 wang and lee 2003 mohan and kim 2012 li and lee 2005a

provide suitable performance and stability results in both theory and simulation but the transient responses of the tracking errors can not be satisfactory in the design somehow once it happens i e a sensors measurement with non gaussian noises or in a bias since sensors give an exact view of the control process actuators implement controller action to meet the design requirements once the noises bias either in the sensor or in the actuator exists although the controller is robust against modeling parametric uncertainties and external disturbances the process performance will still not be good if the controller is designed with fault tolerance then there s no doubt that it can get optimal performance in the uvms b the external disturbance changes with non gaussian unknown distribution randomly and or violently in the last decade the approach of h optimal control has been well known for its robustness and capability of disturbance attenuation in nonlinear system see kim and lewis 2002 kung and chen 2007 xie and su 1997 shen and tamura 1995 zuo et al 2010 gerasimos rigatos et al 2016 this method s essential is to ensure that the system error is as small as possible in the presence of disturbances its ultimate solution is an optimization problem similar to min u max d 1 e u d 2 where e is the system error d is the disturbances assuming disturbances norm value is less than 1 u the control input the problem can be described as a worst case the disturbance d will maximize the error and then the solution becomes to find an optimal control u to minimize the case error zhou et al 2002 we may have seen that the optimization above is actually a mini max differential game of u and d and the optimal control point is the nash equilibrium point basar and bernhard 1995 basar and olsder 1999 which can be designed to increase the robustness of compensation in the presence of unknown statistics unmodeled dynamics and time varying non gaussian disturbances inspired by the documents above an adaptive controller is proposed in this paper the contribution is that our proposed method can overcome inaccurate dynamic model unknown statistics time varying non gaussian external disturbances sensors measurement bias the proposed controller consists of three parts the first part is an ekf estimation compensative system employed to non fully resist the measuring errors payloads variations unmodeled dynamics and underwater environment disturbances as the ekf hypothesis distribution is limited to gaussian the second part is the model based computed torque control controller ctc which is used to eliminate the effect of the approximation error the third part is the h robust compensative controller designed to achieve the desired trajectory tracking performance which can be used to compensate the ekf estimation system for its inaccurate compensation the proposed designing goal is to improve the stable accurate and fast performances of uvms tracking desired trajectory making uvms optimally resist all kinds of disturbances and uncertainties achieving the normal operation in the working environment the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the

newton euler formulation scheme craig 1986 fossen 1994 is applied to derive dynamic modeling of a uvms the frame of the uvms is shown in fig 1 the dynamic equations of motion of a uvms can be established as follows detailed dynamic modeling of the uvms can be found in gianluca antonelli 2013 schjolberg and fossen 1994 fossen 2011 1 m q q c q q q d q q q g q f q q τ where m q m v q v h t q

vehicle and the interaction effects due to the vehicle motion on the manipulator respectively τ is the vector of force moment acting on the vehicle as well as joint torques in a real system it is difficult to get the accurate equation 1 dynamic model due to the uncertainties factors that was not taken into consideration or ignored when modeling there are two main types of uncertainties a parameter s uncertainty such as load arm link quality and its quality centroid length inertia and other geometrical errors b coulomb friction calculation error and sampling delay etc besides uvms will be also affected by outside disturbances such as seawater undercurrent above all we take all the disturbances outside and uncertainties inside as τ d then real environment dynamic model equation of

this research the well known nonlinear filter ekf is designed as an observer to estimate two parts of the uvms i the states vectors of the system used to feedback control as sometimes they are not accurate efficient and practical for measuring by sensors ii the compensation force moment vector acting on the vehicle as well as joint torques which is used to compensate for underwater current

give a more accurate tracking performance and which also can be used to compensate the ekf estimation system for its inaccurate compensation in the next section h robust compensative controller will be designed according to the system lyapunov function candidate overall the proposed controller in our paper consists of three parts the first part is an ekf estimation compensative system employed to non fully resist the unknown statistics measuring errors payloads variations unmodeled dynamics and underwater environment disturbances this method is firstly proposed to the uvms by mohan and kim 2012 as the ekf hypothesis distribution is limited to gaussian for this reason the compensation for non gaussian disturbances is still non fully and biased but it can be used to make an necessarily initial compensation for the uvms laying the foundation for subsequent h robust controller i e reduce the seriousness of the worst case disturbances assumed to the h robust method the second part is the ctc controller which is used to eliminate the effect of the approximation error the underlying idea of this control scheme is to use the existing knowledge of the robot s model to linearize and decouple the robot dofs degrees of freedoms dynamics so that the motion of each dof can be individually controlled using other well developed linear control strategies zuo et al 2010 our ctc designing method is with a pd controller in it so it has the advantage of rapid response however it is used on the inaccurate dynamic model i e exists unmodeled dynamics therefore ctc is also in a biased control which needs a compensation the third part is the h robust compensative controller designed to achieve the desired trajectory accurate tracking performance its design following the minimax h design technique introduced by basar and bernhard 1995 aims at minimizing the system error min u max d 1 e u d 2 prevents the disturbance from trying to maximize it as it is suitable for resisting any unknown statistics disturbances h robust method can consider the differential disturbances i e d m q 1 τ c τ d as a worst case to compensate for the bias from the ekf inaccurate estimation and the ctc action the block diagram that corresponds to the proposed controller is shown in fig 2 the task space end effector goal trajectories are transformed into meaningful desired acceleration velocity and displacement vectors of the system applying the trajectory planner and the inverse kinematics block see gianluca antonelli 2013 kim et al 2015a b the system velocity and displacement tracking errors are calculated using the desired values produced by the inverse kinematics block and the system states feedback values estimated by the ekf block minimax h design technique is used to compensate the ekf and ctc bias 5 h robust compensative controller design and lyapunov stability analysis in order to design the h robust compensative controller feedback linearization technique will be used substitute the adaptive proposed controller equation 15 to dynamic model equation 3 we can get 16 m q e m q v e m q p e m q u τ c τ d let x e e be the state variable then equation 16 can be described as a state space model equation 17 17 e e 0 p i v e e 0 i u 0 i m q 1 τ c τ d let a 0 p i v b 0 i l 0 i then 18 x a x b u l m q 1 τ c τ d here let d m q 1 τ c τ d refer to differential disturbances vector i e the biased value from the ekf compensation and the ctc action for the whole system then we can obtain a closed chain linear tracking error dynamic model equation 19 under the condition of the disturbances 19 x a x b u l d in the h robust control approach a feedback control scheme is designed in the following quadratic objective function 20 j t 1 2 0 t y t t q y t u t t r u t d t t w d t d t q r w 0 y t c x t the significance of the objective function is that the disturbances variable d t tries to maximize the objective function j t while the control signal u t tries to minimize it the physical meaning of the relation given above is that the control signal and the disturbances compete to each other within a mini max differential game gerasimos rigatos et al 2016 qiu 2002 then optimal strategies can be synthesized for both the minimizing and the maximizing players by solving an appropriate riccati differential or difference equation assumption 1 it is assumed that i the energy that is transferred from the disturbances signal d t is bounded that is 0 d t t d t d t ii the matrices a b and a l are stabilizable iii the matrix a c is detectable for given positive definite matrix q r and w there exists a positive definite matrix p obtained from the solution of the riccati equation 21 a t p p a q p 2 b r 1 b t l w 1 l t p then the feedback compensative h robust

which after intermediate operations gives 30 v 1 2 x t q x 1 2 x t p l w 1 l t p x x t p l d or equivalently 31 v 1 2 x t q x 1 2 x t p l w 1 l t p x 1 2 x t p l d 1 2 d t l t p x lemma 1 the

and the previous relation becomes 34 1 2 x t p l d 1 2 d t l t p x 1 2 x t p l w 1 l t p x 1 2 d t w d eq 32 is substituted in eq 31 thus giving 35 v 1 2 x t q x 1 2 d t w d the integration of v from

this paper is shown in fig 3 and its detailed parameters are at the end of our paper appendix a and tables 1 3 in our proposed control algorithm performance analysis the tracking performance and effectiveness comparisons between the proposed controller and a few traditional controllers are done it will be demonstrated by tracking the given desired trajectory generated by the inverse kinematics see gianluca antonelli 2013 kim et al 2015a b in 3 different cases below traditional control schemes used to compare in this paper are pid smc sliding mode control and the controller

noises and modeled uncertainties it is impossible to happen in the real working environment however this case can test the proposed algorithm basic tracking performance given a desired trajectory generated by the inverse kinematics figs 5 7 shows the tracking displacement error of the manipulator vehicle and its end effector in the ideal condition respectively without the external disturbances sensory noises and modeled uncertainties associated with the system it is seen that in this ideal condition case performances of all the tracking controllers are good see figs 5 7 as may be expected because of the known dynamics and no any disturbances it is worth to note that there is no big differences in tracking performance between the proposed method and traditional methods elucidated above all in all our proposed method can do as well as the traditional methods in the basic tracking performance case 2 comparative tracking trajectory with constant external disturbances gaussian sensory noises and modeled uncertainties in this case an external disturbances i e ocean current is added to the uvms in the dynamic model the value is a constant vector v 0 2 0 1 0 5 0 3 0 4 0 1 m s in addition uncertain model parameters include the rigid body parameters inertia mass properties and the flexible parameters joint stiffnesses motor and joint viscous friction coefficients are assumed to be affected by 10 sensory noises affect the position and orientation measurements namely a mean gaussian noises of 0 01 m with a standard deviation of 0 01 m for the position measurements and a mean of 0 01 rad with a standard deviation of 0 01 rad for the orientation measurements figs 8 10 shows the tracking displacement error of the manipulator vehicle and its end effector respectively where the disturbances and uncertainties are associated with the system and the plots shows the comparative performance of all the control schemes elucidated above the results show that the proposed controller and mohan kim s method both can be better in adapting to uncertainties and gaussian constant disturbances as the robust controller s expected but pid and smc are in a poor tracking performance it is noted that two methods can both resist uncertainties and gaussian constant disturbances however our proposed method has a faster tracking convergence less chattering for short time tracking than mohan kim s method as shown in fig 8 which is dedicated to the h robust controller for compensating the ekf estimation bias overall the proposed controller and mohan kim s method are both performed well by adapting to uncertainties system dynamic changes and gaussian constant external disturbances however our method has a smaller tracking error and faster convergence and real working environment is not limited to the noises distributed in gaussian and constant ocean current which will be discussed in the case 3 case 3 comparative tracking trajectory with time varying external disturbances non gaussian sensory noises and modeled uncertainties in this case simulated like real working environment an external disturbances i e ocean current is added to the uvms in the dynamic model which are assumed to be governed by 41 v t 0 5 cos 0 1 π t π 5 0 3 cos 0 3 π t π 6 0 4 cos 0 2 π t π 3 0 2 cos 0 4 π t π 5 0 1 cos 0 5 π t π 4 0 5 cos 0 6 π t π 2 0 6 cos 0 3 π t π 5 m s in addition uncertain model parameters are also assumed to be similar to the case2 affected by 10 sensory noises besides standard gaussian noises introduced in case2 are added by sinusoidal wave of 500 hz sampled at the rate of 8000 samples s i e 42 x t p o s i t i o n o r i e n t a t i o n 2 sin 2 π 500 t 8000 v t where v t are gaussian noises described in case2 figs 12 14 shows the tracking displacement error of the manipulator vehicle and its end effector respectively where the worse disturbances and uncertainties than case2 are associated with the system and the plots shows the comparative performance of all the control schemes elucidated above in this case only our proposed scheme is well in adapting to the disturbances because this case is not still in a gaussian constant noises mohan kim s method will not work as the ekf used by mohan kim is only limited to compensate for the gaussian distribution noises for solving this limitation there should be a compensation for the non gaussian bias our proposed h robust compensative controller can just eliminate the biased from the ekf estimation to realize the uvms robust tracking the desired trajectory it is seen that in presence of non gaussian time varying external disturbances and uncertainties our method still has a fast tracking performance and small tracking error as shown in fig 12 our method firstly uses ekf to estimate a coarse value as a compensation for disturbances and uncertainties and then applies h robust controller to compensate for the bias estimation to realize the system robustness so h robust controller s worst case disturbance assumption becomes critical as well as parameters selected in ctc and ekf which are currently decided by practical engineering experience all of these parameters tuning will be our future work for a deep research overall our proposed method can meet the real working environment operation better than the traditional methods elucidated above especially it is well in compensating for the coupling and non gaussian time varying disturbances effects using the initial compensative ekf observer and the final h robust compensative controller in the condition where the non gaussian time varying disturbances and uncertainties associated with the system using our proposed controller the underwater robot has successfully grabbed the target object as shown in the following fig 11 the green line shows theoretical optimal path of forward kinematics grasping object by the end effector the black line represents the end effector actual route results made by our proposed controller we can see that although there is an initial deviation from the desired line but later through the proposed controller uvms is able to regulate until tracking the desired line successful grabbing the target by the end effector 7 conclusion for solving the problem of the nonlinear uvms tracking control with uncertainties and non gaussian time varying disturbances an adaptive controller is proposed and successfully applied to drive an experimental uvms in our proposed scheme main structure is based on the ctc the ekf estimator and h robust controller are compensative controllers embedded in it comparison of 3 cases results indicate that the proposed controller can provide a faster convergence speed better tracking precision less chattering for short time tracking using the compensative ekf estimator and h robust controller than traditional methods overall the proposed controller designed in this paper can provide a feasible method for controlling a nonlinear

23607,the great east japan tsunami revealed the limits of using only a sea embankment for defense therefore a compound defense system combining a coastal forest and sea embankment for a tsunami overflowing the embankment is proposed to mitigate damage this study was conducted to clarify the changes in overflow volume from an embankment due to the location and thickness of a coastal forest the effect of tree overturning was also investigated in relation to changes in wave height a flume with a gate quickly lifted by air pressure to create an unsteady tsunami like bore was used to investigate the changes in overflow volume and the reflection characteristics of various compound defense models the results show that a landward forest has the advantage of decreasing the fluid force behind the forest and seaward forest can reduce overflow volume landward even when the sea side forest is thin the change in flow pattern in front of the embankment increases its total reflection and decreases the overflow volume by approximately 10 although the forest itself does not increase the reflection a thin seaward and overturned forest also decreases the overflow volume when the approaching tsunami height was less than the embankment height keywords thickness of coastal forest reflection compound defense tsunami surge experiment overflow from embankment 1 introduction the 2011 great east japan tsunami largely exceeded the designed level of coastal defense the tsunami extensively destroyed parts of sea walls tsunami gates large embankments tappin et al 2012 and coastal forests tanaka et al 2013 and thus it caused catastrophic damage to people and buildings in the tohoku and kanto districts of japan udo et al 2012 suppasri et al 2013 after the 2011 tsunami the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism japan mlit classified tsunamis as level 1 and level 2 the return period of the magnitude for level 1 tsunamis is defined as around 100 years interval while that for level 2 tsunamis is within hundreds to a thousand years the goal of the coastal defense against a level 2 tsunami changes from disaster prevention to disaster mitigation the method is also changed from line defense to compound defenses one of the important lessons of the 2011 tsunami is that the effect of a forest as a bioshield was not negligible compared with that of a sea embankment in the mitigation of fluid force tanaka et al 2014 and protection of buildings by trapping floating debris tanaka 2012 pasha and tanaka 2016 although the coastal forest was destroyed many previous studies recognized the effectiveness of coastal vegetation in mitigation of water borne disasters like tsunamis in post disaster surveys after the 1998 papua new guinea tsunami dengler and preuss 2003 2004 indian ocean tsunami danielsen et al 2005 tanaka et al 2007 mascarenhas and jayakumar 2008 and 2011 great east japan tsunami nandasena et al 2012 tanaka 2012 tanaka et al 2014 although the effectiveness and limitations had already been discussed in shuto 1987 attempts to evaluate the effectiveness of a coastal forest were also conducted in numerical simulations that changed the tsunami and forest characteristics hiraishi and harada 2003 harada and imamura 2006 nandasena et al 2008 not only for tsunamis but for storm surge mitigation the effectiveness was also examined in vietnam mazda et al 1997 and bangladesh tanaka 2008 on the other hand the limitations of the tsunami mitigation capacity of a coastal forest were also discussed in terms of the destruction of the coastal forest itself tanaka et al 2007 production of driftwood dengler and preuss 2003 cochard et al 2008 and channeling of the flow into a gap in a coastal forest thuy et al 2009 tanaka 2009 nandasena et al 2012 the effectiveness of an embankment in the great east japan tsunami was also considered in post tsunami surveys and numerical simulations considering the inundation area and fluid force dao et al 2014 tanaka et al 2014 however not many studies of multiple defenses composed of embankment coastal forest and or ditches were conducted except for the post tsunami surveys and their evaluation to design future coastal zones it is very important to clarify the effects of a coastal forest combined with other artificial structures like an embankment or a natural system such as sand dunes or a lagoon recently the number of studies of the compound defenses using embankment with a coastal forest tanaka et al 2007 2014 tokida and tanimoto 2014 sand dunes tanaka et al 2006 the combination of hollow topography embankment and coastal forest usman et al 2014 and a second embankment tanaka and igarashi 2016 is increasing however much is still unknown not only field surveys but also physical experiments and or numerical simulations indicated the effectiveness of vegetation for decreasing the run up heights of a tsunami irtem et al 2009 ismail et al 2012 and for increasing reflection and decreasing transmission of a solitary wave huang et al 2011 noarayanan et al 2012 proposed new parameter for expressing vegetation resistance that combines the structural rigidity of the individual model stem flow parameters and vegetation parameters however most of the experiments were conducted using a physical model of only a coastal forest and were not combined with an embankment as the arrangement of a coastal forest and embankment a continuous landscape structure of a sand beach sand grasses and a coastal forest is natural and an embankment behind a coastal forest is ecologically beneficial a coastal forest also can partially reflect a tsunami irtem et al 2009 iimura and tanaka 2012 ismail et al 2012 thus a forest in front of an embankment may increase the reflection however coastal forests without embankments were damaged more in the 2011 great east japan tsunami because they received the tsunami fluid force directly tanaka et al 2013 and forests in front of steep slopes received a large fluid force due to reflection by steep hills in the 2010 mentawai tsunami huang et al 2013 on the other hand a coastal forest behind an embankment also has a disadvantage because large amounts of coastal forest were destroyed by erosion of the substrate and the forest produced large amounts of driftwood tappin et al 2012 tanaka 2012 moreover a coastal forest behind an embankment cannot be expected to decrease the overtopping flow from the embankment considering the advantages and disadvantages it is very important to quantitatively estimate the effect of relative positions of coastal forest and embankment considering that the land available on which to construct a green belt is limited tanaka et al 2011 and the fact that trees have a high probability of being broken in fact most were bent at the great east japan tsunami tanaka et al 2013 the effectiveness of a coastal forest combined with an embankment should be clarified especially paying attention to the thin coastal forest and that fact that broken trees as inclined cylinders can also provide resistance poulin and larsen 2007 thuy et al 2012 therefore the objectives of this study were to clarify the effectiveness of a compound defense system combining a coastal forest and sea embankment the flow structure and overflow volume when a tsunami current overflowed or passed through the physical model combining forest and embankment model were investigated this study focused on the location on the coast and number of rows of trees in front of or behind an embankment to obtain the optimal compound defense system with changes in the magnitude of surge type flow an overturned tree model was also used to evaluate the effectiveness more realistically in a disaster situation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus and procedures fig 1 shows the experimental flume setup a water flume 18 m in length and 0 4 m in width with a quickly lifting gate which is similar to that of yeh et al 1989 was used at saitama university yeh et al 1989 showed that a single bore can be generated by a lifting gate that initially separates the quiescent water on the model beach from the deeper water behind the gate the gate used in this study can be lifted 15 20 and 25 cm in 0 384 0 512 and 0 640 s respectively by the operating air pressure of 0 65 mpa in the experimental channel a constant 1 10 slope was set from the gate the model scale was set at 1 100 and froude similarity was used in the coastal forest affected by the 2011 great east japan tsunami the diameter of tree trunks at breast height tree height and tree density were 0 2 0 5 m including broken trees 18 m and 0 20 trees m2 respectively considering the real scale the diameter height and spacing were 0 4 cm 18 cm and 2 3 cm respectively in many previous studies trees were usually modeled using vertical cylinders of a stiff material e g nepf 1999 pasha and tanaka 2017 for the tree models circular wooden cylinders were selected tanaka et al 2013 classified two breaking modes of trees under a destructive tsunami force tree trunk breakage and overturning overturning occurs when the overturning moment exceeds the root anchorage strength tanaka and yagisawa 2009 samarakoon et al 2013 under diameters corresponding to the actual scale 0 4 m tree trunk breakage was not observed tanaka et al 2013 however at this diameter 0 4 m the breaking mode was classified as overturning tanaka et al 2013 therefore the effect of trees overturning is very important and was investigated in this study the modulus of elasticity moe of tree models in this study was around 16000 mpa in this study when the drag force on the tree model was at maximum the maximum strain was 0 39 mm at the maximum water level during the experiment 20 6 cm the effect of bending and tree trunk breakage caused by the bending are also important phenomena however the breaking mode produced large amounts of driftwood tanaka et al 2013 and is not recommended for a combined defense system thus the diameter of 0 4 m model scale 0 4 cm was selected and the effects of standing trees and overturning trees were investigated the model trees were set in staggered arrangement as shown in fig 1 and the tree density of the model was 0 22 cylinders cm2 it is widely known that vegetation resistance varies with vegetation density nepf 1999 vegetation height and arrangement li and shen 1973 when the spacing of trees is the same the drag coefficient of staggered arrangement demonstrated 50 23 larger values than the grid arrangement for 4d 20d d diameter the change in resistance due to the forest structure arrangement forest length and tree density is also important but this study set two extreme conditions thick and thin of forest thickness and did not consider the inside structure of the forest an investigation of inside structure of forest will be conducted in the future two types of tree model were selected by setting the number of rows to 40 t40 and 2 t2 these cylinders were completely fixed to the flume bed moreover a 2 row tree model that overturned when a tsunami hit t2 o was also used considering the post tsunami surveys tanaka et al 2014 these cylinders were fixed in the base cylinder as shown in fig 3a the base cylinder is set in the flume bed and can freely overturn in the stream wise direction fig 3b and c the model wooden embankment height was 6 2 cm the combinations of tree and embankment models are shown in table 1 2 1 1 series a experiments to clarify the effects of modeled trees and an embankment on reducing overflow volume five experiments were conducted in series a table 1 in which e and t represent the embankment and trees respectively subscripts 40 and b mean 40 rows placed on the bed and n means neither tree model nor embankment model was placed case t40be and case et40b were combined cases where tree and embankment models were on tank and land sides and on land and tank sides respectively 2 1 2 series b experiments when vegetation is sparse a surge type tsunami with a supercritical flow can be expected to pass through it under the supercritical condition in that case reflection by the vegetation cannot be expected moreover increasing the water depth behind the vegetation due to resistance to it may increase the overflow volume from the embankment to clarify the effectiveness or non effectiveness a very thin tree model two rows t2 was set in front of the embankment case t2e in series b experiments and overflow volume from the embankment was measured in the experiment the effect of the distance from the tree model edge to the embankment model edge l te was also investigated in the range of 2 22 cm for comparison case e embankment only and casest2t e and t2s e were conducted to clarify the mechanism of reflection the subscripts for case t2 represent the place where b is located on the bed t2b t is on the top t2t fig 2 b and s is on the slope of the embankment t2s fig 2c 2 1 3 series c experiments when the vegetation was located on the sea side the impact force on it was assumed to be relatively larger than when it was placed behind the embankment tanaka et al 2014 in series c experiments the overturning of vegetation by a tsunami was included and the effect on the overflow volume from the embankment was investigated in addition the timing of overturning was changed the freely overturned type t2b of means the tree model was easily overturned when the tsunami hit case t2b ofe the enduring and overturned type t2b or means the tree model withstood the first hit but was overturned before the reflection from the embankment arrived case t2b ore for case t2b ore l te was set constantly at 22 cm because the time between the first hit and the arrival of the reflected wave for 2 cm and 12 cm cases was short 2 2 parameters used in this study 2 2 1 non dimensional wave height the quickly lifting gate created a bore type flow by setting the tank water depth at still water depths h t of 9 8 14 8 and 19 8 cm as shown in fig 4 the wave heights at g2 for h t 9 8 14 8 and 19 8 correspond to 5 33 7 87 and 10 2 cm in the model dividing the wave height by the embankment height defines the non dimensional wave height h this study used h to discuss the effects of tsunami magnitude on the overflow volume for different compound defense systems 2 2 2 two types of non dimensional overflow volume in series a experiments changes in overflow volume v were investigated not only for the combination case but also for a single model case i e vegetation model or embankment model in comparison with the inundation volume v n for the no model case case n then the non dimensional overflow volume compared with the inundation volume was defined as v n v v n in series b and c experiments the non dimensional overflow volume compared with the overflow volume for only the embankment v e was defined as v e v v e when the overflow volumes in series a experiments were compared with those in series b and c experiments the parameter v e was used 2 2 3 ratio of reduction in overflow volume v for comparing all the cases in series a b and c experiments except in case n and case t40b the reduction in each overflow volume compared with the overflow volume for only the embankment v e was defined as v v e v v e 2 2 4 ratio of reduction in overflow volume per row v the numbers of tree rows in series a b and c were 40 2 and 2 respectively to understand the effectiveness of reducing the overflow volume per row in series a b and c experiments except in case n and case t40b the ratio of reduction in overflow volume per row v is defined as v v the number of rows of tree model 2 2 5 non dimensional distance between embankment model and tree model lte l te is defined the ratio of the distance from the tree model edge to embankment edge l te and embankment height z e 2 2 6 definition of fluid force index if and moment index im to compare the different compound defense systems fluid force f and moment m by fluid force in a unit width were estimated by the measured water depth and estimated velocity as 1 f 1 2 c d ρ u 2 h 1 1 2 c d ρ i f 2 m f h 2 1 4 c d ρ u 2 h 2 1 4 c d ρ i m where c d is the drag coefficient c d is 1 0 or 2 1 respectively depending on whether the fluid force corresponds to a cylinder or a flat plate ρ density of fluid h tsunami inundation depth u depth averaged velocity and i f and i m are the fluid force index u 2 h and moment index u 2 h 2 respectively as shown in eqs 1 and 2 the two indices can represent the fundamental fluid force characteristics of flows multiplying the c d density of fluid and coefficient of the index can express the fluid force and the moment the fluid force index u 2 h and moment index u 2 h 2 were also utilized to determine the breaking or washout condition of houses tanaka et al 2014 2 3 methods for evaluating overflow volume from embankment 2 3 1 series a experiments cases n e t40b t40be et40b for cases n e t40b et40b overflow discharge q vhb was calculated from the measured values where v and h were the velocity and water depth at g3 respectively and b was the channel width the overflow volume was derived by integrating the overflow discharge in time for case t40be as the flow became subcritical when the flow passed through the forest the overflow discharge was calculated by the critical depth h c and the critical velocity gh c 0 5 where g is gravitational acceleration although it is difficult to estimate the critical water depth for the unsteady condition this study defines the h c as at the center of the embankment top from the distribution of water depth at the embankment top the error was 20 for the four cases case e t40b t40be et40b with case n in series a the overflow volume was integrated in 10 s because the overflow was almost finished and needed to be compared with the same time in case n where reflected waves from the channel wall can be neglected did not reach the investigated region 2 3 2 series b and c experiments case e t2b e t2t e t2s e t2b of e t2b or e in these series experiments the model with two rows of trees was used and the difference in overflow volume was small thus the overflow volume was measured directly by making a retention pool behind the embankment calibration curves for the water depth in the pool and the reserved volume were made and the water depth in the pool was measured in each experiment 3 results 3 1 changes in overflow volume due to combination and location of embankment and coastal forest series a experiments 3 1 1 non dimensional overflow volume v n v v n in series a experiments v n v v n for series a experiments case e t40b t40be et40b are shown in fig 5 in relation to the non dimensional wave height at g2 due to the effect of the arrangement of embankment and forest the non dimensional overflow volume v n in case t40be was smaller than that in case et40b therefore a sea side coastal forest is able to reduce the overflow volume from the embankment by reflecting a part of a tsunami the v n in case e were also compared with those in case t40b when the non dimensional wave heights were 0 86 1 27 and 1 64 v n in case e were 0 29 0 51 and 0 65 respectively and v n in case t40b for the same heights were 0 58 0 63 and 0 59 respectively when the non dimensional wave heights were small i e 0 86 and 1 27 v n in case e were smaller than that in case t40b however the trend was opposite for the cases when the non dimensional wave height was large 1 64 this is because the reflection and transmission patterns were different for each case for case e in which a part of the tsunami current was reflected the overflow flux was not much increased in comparison with the increase in the non dimensional wave height for case t40b when the non dimensional wave height at g2 h was large the water depth at the vegetation became large and the reflection was increased by the increased resistance thus the reflection was increased with the increasing h and v n took similar values for the increase in h to clarify the effect of vegetation behind an embankment the v n in case et40b were compared with those in case e the reason why the v n in case et40b had smaller values than those in case e is that the overflow current from the embankment was tentatively stored in front of the vegetation by resistance and reflection and part of the stored water overflowed again when the tsunami water depth at the top of embankment decreased h 1 64 moreover because v n is defined during the 10 s after the current arrived at g1 the volume was slightly underestimated in case et40b in which the arrival to g3 was delayed due to resistance by the vegetation although an overflow of the embankment from vegetation to the sea side did not occur h 0 86 1 27 3 1 2 time series of reflected waves time series of water depths at g2 for cases e t40b et40b and t40b e are shown in fig 6 for the non dimensional wave height h of 0 86 the time series of water depths for case n is also shown for comparison when h was 0 86 the time series of water depths including the reflected wave was almost the same for the two cases case e and case et40b in case et40b reflection occurred in front of the vegetated region after the water overtopped the embankment when h was 1 64 the reflected wave overflowed the embankment again but when h was 0 86 the water accumulation in the vegetation front was shallower than the embankment height thus overflow from the vegetation side did not occur and the reflected waves were almost identical however v n for case e was slightly larger than that in case et40b in fig 5 this is due to the delay effect of 40 rows of vegetation because the volume is calculated during the 10 s to g3 after the wave arrived at g1 elapsed time fig 7 shows the time series of overflow volume for cases n e and et40b this shows that the overflow volume for case e was large during the elapsed time of 3 6 s and suddenly declined at around 6 8 s on the other hand the overflow volume for case et40b h 0 86 gradually increased during the elapsed time of 3 5 6 s and gradually decreased afterwards after 7 s the overflow volume for case et40b was slightly larger than that for case e this delay caused the decrease of volume at 10 s shown in fig 5 but actually the volume was the same when the elapsed time was extended to measure all the overflow water as already explained in 3 1 1 3 1 3 fluid force index and moment index fig 8 a 8b shows comparisons of the fluid force index and moment index defined in eqs 1 and 2 for each case for both indexes case et40 shows the minimum value these two indexes are representative parameters to express the breaking condition of houses tanaka et al 2014 this point will be discussed later 3 2 effect of 2 row sea side forests on changing overflow volume from embankment series b experiment v e v v e in series b experiments cases t2be t2te t2se are shown in fig 9 in relation to non dimensional wave height at g2 3 2 1 non dimensional overflow volume v e v v e in case t2be fig 9 shows that v e declined around 10 20 irrespective of l te fig 10 shows time series of reflected waves at g1 for case t2be and case e the first reflected wave shown in arrow a is from the bed slope and the maximum depth is from the embankment arrow b for case t2be a reflection by vegetation was not observed however the water passed through and increased behind the vegetation and was reflected when the reflected wave from the embankment passed through the vegetation to the sea side arrow c shows the reflected wave pattern the maximum water depth was slightly larger in case t2be compared with case e and the reflected wave arrival time was also slightly faster although it was not clear because the reflection occurred soon after the reflection from the slope thus it is reasonable to consider that v e was decreased for case t2be compared with case e fig 9 3 2 2 v e in case t2te and case t2se effect of tree location for case t2te the accumulation of water between the vegetation and the embankment that occurred in case t2be was not seen however the overflow volume was decreased by around 5 10 fig 9 it is assumed that the run up flow on the embankment slope decreases the froude number and afterwards the resistance at the top of the embankment reflects part of the water however in case t2se v e exceeded 1 when h was 0 86 this means that the overflow volume was increased by the existence of vegetation on the slope the reflection in case t2se is assumed to be small compared with that in case t2te because the accumulated water was low it also possibly decreased the resistance of the embankment and reflection by the embankment itself because the vegetation changed the flow direction slightly upward reflection by vegetation increased with increasing h but v e was not much affected by h because the reflected area was the same therefore v e decreased with increasing h as shown in fig 9 3 3 effect of sea side overturning 2 row forest on changing overflow volume from embankment series c experiment v e v v e in series c experiments cases t2b ofe t2b ore is shown in fig 11 in relation to the non dimensional wave height at g2 3 3 1 v e in case t2b ofe effect of tree overturning in tsunami event v e for the overturning type was not much changed i e case t2b ofe when h was 1 64 fig 11 when the forest was overturned and resistance was decreased the water depth behind the vegetation did not increase and reflection by the embankment was dominant on the other hand v e was decreased around 20 for an h of 0 86 this value was similar to case t2be this will be discussed later considering the flow mechanism in greater detail 3 3 2 v e in case t2b ore effect of timing of tree overturning in tsunami event the effect of the timing of tree overturning changed in case t2b ore where the overturning occurred just before the reflected wave arrived for l te 3 55 compared the case t2b ore l te 3 55 fig 11 with the freely overturned type case v2b ofe l te 3 55 v e in case t2b ore decreased around 3 for h 0 86 and 1 27 and 1 5 for h 1 64 4 discussion 4 1 difference in non dimensional overflow volumes the relationship between the reflection and overflow volume is discussed first fig 12 shows photos taken immediately after the reflection had occurred for case t40b and case t40be fig 12a the current intruded as a super critical condition and increased the water depth inside the vegetation only 2 3 rows from the landside front of vegetation after that the reflection occurred when sea side vegetation is thin a tsunami easily passes through the vegetation as super critical flow and the reflection cannot be expected to increase however v e decreased around 10 20 this is the combined effect of vegetation and embankment when the current passed through the vegetation the water depth increased slightly and then decreased fig 12b 1 the water again was pushed upward by the existence of the embankment slope and the stored or delayed water went toward the sea together fig 12b 2 with the reflected wave that was generated at the top of the embankment this mechanism increased the reflection and decreased the overflow volume the differences in the effect of length between the tree model edge and embankment model edge were small in this case a storage space where downward flow behind vegetation and upward flow on the slope can be generated was important and the length was adequate in our experimental cases for the overturning type v e was less than 1 when h was small fig 12c this is similar to the mechanism for the standing type however when the h was large the effect decreased fig 12d and the v e was not much changed with the case e fig 13 shows the relationship between the ratio of reduction in overflow volume v for different non dimensional wave heights h at g2 for every h v in case t40be was far larger than in other cases fig 13b shows that when h at g2 was 0 86 v defined as v per row was larger in t2 cases than those in 40 row cases except for case t2se as already discussed vegetation has some capacity to decrease the reflection from the slope except for this case not only the reflection but also the combined effect with trees and embankment was assumed to be present even when tree destruction occurs when h at g2 was 0 86 v was large because the inclined circular cylinders still can provide drag forces to the flow poulin and larsen 2007 thuy et al 2012 many previous post tsunami surveys indicated the effectiveness of coastal vegetation for tsunami disaster mitigation danielsen et al 2005 mascarenhas and jayakumar 2008 nandasena et al 2012 tanaka 2012 tanaka et al 2014 even though a forest has limitations due to the possibility of its destruction and production of driftwood shuto 1987 dengler and preuss 2003 although dao et al 2014 showed the effectiveness of an embankment in the great east japan tsunami not many studies were conducted of compound defenses composed of an embankment coastal forest and or ditches except for post tsunami surveys and its evaluations tanaka et al 2014 tokida and tanimoto 2014 usman et al 2014 in most cases of compound defenses a rear side forest was proposed to be more vulnerable when a sea side embankment did not exist tanaka 2012 however a beach forest forest on sand dunes or mangroves sometimes plays an important role in the landscape in tropical countries moreover this type of forest can be constructed in some cases even where land is limited an actual planting in sri lanka showed the difficulties in constructing a thick forest because of the land limitation tanaka et al 2011 in that case a thin front side forest was a viable option to strengthen the mitigating function of the available land a thin forest also has the advantage of requiring smaller spacing between trees because light availability does not much affect tree growth compared with a thick forest this study showed a clear advantage of a frontside forest to reduce the overtopping flow from an embankment thus reducing the size of the inundated area in the destruction of a coastal forest in front of embankment a tree has a high likelihood of being broken in a huge tsunami when there is no embankment on the sea side tanaka 2012 even when the trees were overturned our experiment showed the effectiveness of a forest when the approaching tsunami height was less than the embankment height although most of the destroyed trees remained in place even though they were overturned or bent erosion was not severe tanaka 2012 however more study is needed because a forest may be broken not only by the push wave but also by the reflected wave from landward huang et al 2013 in addition more study of the forest structure itself is needed a previous study indicated the effects of the inside structure of a forest on energy loss pasha and tanaka 2017 reported the importance of tree density and forest length on flow pattern and energy loss noarayanan et al 2012 investigated the friction factor and energy loss due to vegetation in a flow especially paying attention to the oscillation phenomena with the change of vfp which includes all the vegetation and flow characteristics proposed in their study 4 2 fluid force reduction this study indicated the effectiveness of a sea side coastal forest to reduce the overflow volume from the embankment even when the forest is thin and trees are overturned in a tsunami event compared with a landside coastal forest with an embankment however as shown in fig 8 the fluid force index behind the embankment in case t40be was larger than that in case et40b the tsunami fluid force greatly affected the comparatively fragile buildings in the great east japan tsunami suppasri et al 2013 when a tsunami overflowed an embankment large scoured areas or ditches were generated behind the sea embankment tappin et al 2012 tokida and tanimoto 2014 and river embankment tanaka and sato 2015 some houses just behind the coastal forest remained standing in the 2011 tsunami due to the reduction of fluid force by the coastal forest including the trapping function of floating debris tanaka 2012 tanaka et al 2013 considering this effect if the land is available a coastal forest behind an embankment has the advantage of reducing the fluid force if the embankment is high the advantage increases when the trees are not broken tanaka et al 2014 therefore the combination of an embankment and a coastal forest should be discussed based on the availability of land and current land utilization if the amount of land is limited and the overflow volume should be decreased a sea side forest is one viable option if the land behind an embankment can be used as a buffer zone a rear side forest is also applicable of course forests on both sides are assumed to be more advantageous but more study is needed on that point 5 summary the 2011 great east japan tsunami revealed the limits of a hard solution when it is composed of only a sea embankment thus the mitigation of a level 2 tsunami recurrence cycle of around several hundred to 1000 years is discussed in terms of a system of multiple defenses by using not only a single sea embankment but also a combination of several hard and soft solutions the objective of this study was to clarify the effectiveness of the combination of an embankment and a coastal forest for decreasing the overflow volume and fluid force behind the compound defense system flume tests using a quickly lifting gate that can produce a tsunami like bore type flow were conducted to determine the optimal arrangement the following conclusions were derived from the flume study 1 an arrangement of a thick coastal forest 40 rows and an embankment inside of which the water reflection can start has an ability to decrease the overflow volume from the embankment around 97 57 decrease from the embankment only case within the experimental range of non dimensional tsunami wave height 0 86 1 64 2 when the sea side forest is thin 2 rows the reflection cannot start inside however the up and down motion generated by the forest and embankment can increase the reflection the water stored between the forest and embankment moves together with the water reflected from the embankment the combined effects can decrease the overflow volume from the embankment around 20 10 decrease from the embankment only case within the experimental range of non dimensional tsunami wave height 0 86 1 64 3 even when the forest is thin and trees are overturned the water reflection can be increased when the approaching tsunami height is less than the embankment height 4 a landward forest from an embankment has the advantage of decreasing the fluid force just behind the forest around 80 and 67 reduction of fluid force index compared with the embankment only case for non dimensional tsunami wave heights 1 27 and 1 64 respectively and thus has a possibility of mitigating house destruction more study is needed of the driftwood production around an embankment together with investigation on the movements of driftwood and the disadvantages of these phenomena

23607,the great east japan tsunami revealed the limits of using only a sea embankment for defense therefore a compound defense system combining a coastal forest and sea embankment for a tsunami overflowing the embankment is proposed to mitigate damage this study was conducted to clarify the changes in overflow volume from an embankment due to the location and thickness of a coastal forest the effect of tree overturning was also investigated in relation to changes in wave height a flume with a gate quickly lifted by air pressure to create an unsteady tsunami like bore was used to investigate the changes in overflow volume and the reflection characteristics of various compound defense models the results show that a landward forest has the advantage of decreasing the fluid force behind the forest and seaward forest can reduce overflow volume landward even when the sea side forest is thin the change in flow pattern in front of the embankment increases its total reflection and decreases the overflow volume by approximately 10 although the forest itself does not increase the reflection a thin seaward and overturned forest also decreases the overflow volume when the approaching tsunami height was less than the embankment height keywords thickness of coastal forest reflection compound defense tsunami surge experiment overflow from embankment 1 introduction the 2011 great east japan tsunami largely exceeded the designed level of coastal defense the tsunami extensively destroyed parts of sea walls tsunami gates large embankments tappin et al 2012 and coastal forests tanaka et al 2013 and thus it caused catastrophic damage to people and buildings in the tohoku and kanto districts of japan udo et al 2012 suppasri et al 2013 after the 2011 tsunami the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism japan mlit classified tsunamis as level 1 and level 2 the return period of the magnitude for level 1 tsunamis is defined as around 100 years interval while that for level 2 tsunamis is within hundreds to a thousand years the goal of the coastal defense against a level 2 tsunami changes from disaster prevention to disaster mitigation the method is also changed from line defense to compound defenses one of the important lessons of the 2011 tsunami is that the effect of a forest as a bioshield was not negligible compared with that of a sea embankment in the mitigation of fluid force tanaka et al 2014 and protection of buildings by trapping floating debris tanaka 2012 pasha and tanaka 2016 although the coastal forest was destroyed many previous studies recognized the effectiveness of coastal vegetation in mitigation of water borne disasters like tsunamis in post disaster surveys after the 1998 papua new guinea tsunami dengler and preuss 2003 2004 indian ocean tsunami danielsen et al 2005 tanaka et al 2007 mascarenhas and jayakumar 2008 and 2011 great east japan tsunami nandasena et al 2012 tanaka 2012 tanaka et al 2014 although the effectiveness and limitations had already been discussed in shuto 1987 attempts to evaluate the effectiveness of a coastal forest were also conducted in numerical simulations that changed the tsunami and forest characteristics hiraishi and harada 2003 harada and imamura 2006 nandasena et al 2008 not only for tsunamis but for storm surge mitigation the effectiveness was also examined in vietnam mazda et al 1997 and bangladesh tanaka 2008 on the other hand the limitations of the tsunami mitigation capacity of a coastal forest were also discussed in terms of the destruction of the coastal forest itself tanaka et al 2007 production of driftwood dengler and preuss 2003 cochard et al 2008 and channeling of the flow into a gap in a coastal forest thuy et al 2009 tanaka 2009 nandasena et al 2012 the effectiveness of an embankment in the great east japan tsunami was also considered in post tsunami surveys and numerical simulations considering the inundation area and fluid force dao et al 2014 tanaka et al 2014 however not many studies of multiple defenses composed of embankment coastal forest and or ditches were conducted except for the post tsunami surveys and their evaluation to design future coastal zones it is very important to clarify the effects of a coastal forest combined with other artificial structures like an embankment or a natural system such as sand dunes or a lagoon recently the number of studies of the compound defenses using embankment with a coastal forest tanaka et al 2007 2014 tokida and tanimoto 2014 sand dunes tanaka et al 2006 the combination of hollow topography embankment and coastal forest usman et al 2014 and a second embankment tanaka and igarashi 2016 is increasing however much is still unknown not only field surveys but also physical experiments and or numerical simulations indicated the effectiveness of vegetation for decreasing the run up heights of a tsunami irtem et al 2009 ismail et al 2012 and for increasing reflection and decreasing transmission of a solitary wave huang et al 2011 noarayanan et al 2012 proposed new parameter for expressing vegetation resistance that combines the structural rigidity of the individual model stem flow parameters and vegetation parameters however most of the experiments were conducted using a physical model of only a coastal forest and were not combined with an embankment as the arrangement of a coastal forest and embankment a continuous landscape structure of a sand beach sand grasses and a coastal forest is natural and an embankment behind a coastal forest is ecologically beneficial a coastal forest also can partially reflect a tsunami irtem et al 2009 iimura and tanaka 2012 ismail et al 2012 thus a forest in front of an embankment may increase the reflection however coastal forests without embankments were damaged more in the 2011 great east japan tsunami because they received the tsunami fluid force directly tanaka et al 2013 and forests in front of steep slopes received a large fluid force due to reflection by steep hills in the 2010 mentawai tsunami huang et al 2013 on the other hand a coastal forest behind an embankment also has a disadvantage because large amounts of coastal forest were destroyed by erosion of the substrate and the forest produced large amounts of driftwood tappin et al 2012 tanaka 2012 moreover a coastal forest behind an embankment cannot be expected to decrease the overtopping flow from the embankment considering the advantages and disadvantages it is very important to quantitatively estimate the effect of relative positions of coastal forest and embankment considering that the land available on which to construct a green belt is limited tanaka et al 2011 and the fact that trees have a high probability of being broken in fact most were bent at the great east japan tsunami tanaka et al 2013 the effectiveness of a coastal forest combined with an embankment should be clarified especially paying attention to the thin coastal forest and that fact that broken trees as inclined cylinders can also provide resistance poulin and larsen 2007 thuy et al 2012 therefore the objectives of this study were to clarify the effectiveness of a compound defense system combining a coastal forest and sea embankment the flow structure and overflow volume when a tsunami current overflowed or passed through the physical model combining forest and embankment model were investigated this study focused on the location on the coast and number of rows of trees in front of or behind an embankment to obtain the optimal compound defense system with changes in the magnitude of surge type flow an overturned tree model was also used to evaluate the effectiveness more realistically in a disaster situation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus and procedures fig 1 shows the experimental flume setup a water flume 18 m in length and 0 4 m in width with a quickly lifting gate which is similar to that of yeh et al 1989 was used at saitama university yeh et al 1989 showed that a single bore can be generated by a lifting gate that initially separates the quiescent water on the model beach from the deeper water behind the gate the gate used in this study can be lifted 15 20 and 25 cm in 0 384 0 512 and 0 640 s respectively by the operating air pressure of 0 65 mpa in the experimental channel a constant 1 10 slope was set from the gate the model scale was set at 1 100 and froude similarity was used in the coastal forest affected by the 2011 great east japan tsunami the diameter of tree trunks at breast height tree height and tree density were 0 2 0 5 m including broken trees 18 m and 0 20 trees m2 respectively considering the real scale the diameter height and spacing were 0 4 cm 18 cm and 2 3 cm respectively in many previous studies trees were usually modeled using vertical cylinders of a stiff material e g nepf 1999 pasha and tanaka 2017 for the tree models circular wooden cylinders were selected tanaka et al 2013 classified two breaking modes of trees under a destructive tsunami force tree trunk breakage and overturning overturning occurs when the overturning moment exceeds the root anchorage strength tanaka and yagisawa 2009 samarakoon et al 2013 under diameters corresponding to the actual scale 0 4 m tree trunk breakage was not observed tanaka et al 2013 however at this diameter 0 4 m the breaking mode was classified as overturning tanaka et al 2013 therefore the effect of trees overturning is very important and was investigated in this study the modulus of elasticity moe of tree models in this study was around 16000 mpa in this study when the drag force on the tree model was at maximum the maximum strain was 0 39 mm at the maximum water level during the experiment 20 6 cm the effect of bending and tree trunk breakage caused by the bending are also important phenomena however the breaking mode produced large amounts of driftwood tanaka et al 2013 and is not recommended for a combined defense system thus the diameter of 0 4 m model scale 0 4 cm was selected and the effects of standing trees and overturning trees were investigated the model trees were set in staggered arrangement as shown in fig 1 and the tree density of the model was 0 22 cylinders cm2 it is widely known that vegetation resistance varies with vegetation density nepf 1999 vegetation height and arrangement li and shen 1973 when the spacing of trees is the same the drag coefficient of staggered arrangement demonstrated 50 23 larger values than the grid arrangement for 4d 20d d diameter the change in resistance due to the forest structure arrangement forest length and tree density is also important but this study set two extreme conditions thick and thin of forest thickness and did not consider the inside structure of the forest an investigation of inside structure of forest will be conducted in the future two types of tree model were selected by setting the number of rows to 40 t40 and 2 t2 these cylinders were completely fixed to the flume bed moreover a 2 row tree model that overturned when a tsunami hit t2 o was also used considering the post tsunami surveys tanaka et al 2014 these cylinders were fixed in the base cylinder as shown in fig 3a the base cylinder is set in the flume bed and can freely overturn in the stream wise direction fig 3b and c the model wooden embankment height was 6 2 cm the combinations of tree and embankment models are shown in table 1 2 1 1 series a experiments to clarify the effects of modeled trees and an embankment on reducing overflow volume five experiments were conducted in series a table 1 in which e and t represent the embankment and trees respectively subscripts 40 and b mean 40 rows placed on the bed and n means neither tree model nor embankment model was placed case t40be and case et40b were combined cases where tree and embankment models were on tank and land sides and on land and tank sides respectively 2 1 2 series b experiments when vegetation is sparse a surge type tsunami with a supercritical flow can be expected to pass through it under the supercritical condition in that case reflection by the vegetation cannot be expected moreover increasing the water depth behind the vegetation due to resistance to it may increase the overflow volume from the embankment to clarify the effectiveness or non effectiveness a very thin tree model two rows t2 was set in front of the embankment case t2e in series b experiments and overflow volume from the embankment was measured in the experiment the effect of the distance from the tree model edge to the embankment model edge l te was also investigated in the range of 2 22 cm for comparison case e embankment only and casest2t e and t2s e were conducted to clarify the mechanism of reflection the subscripts for case t2 represent the place where b is located on the bed t2b t is on the top t2t fig 2 b and s is on the slope of the embankment t2s fig 2c 2 1 3 series c experiments when the vegetation was located on the sea side the impact force on it was assumed to be relatively larger than when it was placed behind the embankment tanaka et al 2014 in series c experiments the overturning of vegetation by a tsunami was included and the effect on the overflow volume from the embankment was investigated in addition the timing of overturning was changed the freely overturned type t2b of means the tree model was easily overturned when the tsunami hit case t2b ofe the enduring and overturned type t2b or means the tree model withstood the first hit but was overturned before the reflection from the embankment arrived case t2b ore for case t2b ore l te was set constantly at 22 cm because the time between the first hit and the arrival of the reflected wave for 2 cm and 12 cm cases was short 2 2 parameters used in this study 2 2 1 non dimensional wave height the quickly lifting gate created a bore type flow by setting the tank water depth at still water depths h t of 9 8 14 8 and 19 8 cm as shown in fig 4 the wave heights at g2 for h t 9 8 14 8 and 19 8 correspond to 5 33 7 87 and 10 2 cm in the model dividing the wave height by the embankment height defines the non dimensional wave height h this study used h to discuss the effects of tsunami magnitude on the overflow volume for different compound defense systems 2 2 2 two types of non dimensional overflow volume in series a experiments changes in overflow volume v were investigated not only for the combination case but also for a single model case i e vegetation model or embankment model in comparison with the inundation volume v n for the no model case case n then the non dimensional overflow volume compared with the inundation volume was defined as v n v v n in series b and c experiments the non dimensional overflow volume compared with the overflow volume for only the embankment v e was defined as v e v v e when the overflow volumes in series a experiments were compared with those in series b and c experiments the parameter v e was used 2 2 3 ratio of reduction in overflow volume v for comparing all the cases in series a b and c experiments except in case n and case t40b the reduction in each overflow volume compared with the overflow volume for only the embankment v e was defined as v v e v v e 2 2 4 ratio of reduction in overflow volume per row v the numbers of tree rows in series a b and c were 40 2 and 2 respectively to understand the effectiveness of reducing the overflow volume per row in series a b and c experiments except in case n and case t40b the ratio of reduction in overflow volume per row v is defined as v v the number of rows of tree model 2 2 5 non dimensional distance between embankment model and tree model lte l te is defined the ratio of the distance from the tree model edge to embankment edge l te and embankment height z e 2 2 6 definition of fluid force index if and moment index im to compare the different compound defense systems fluid force f and moment m by fluid force in a unit width were estimated by the measured water depth and estimated velocity as 1 f 1 2 c d ρ u 2 h 1 1 2 c d ρ i f 2 m f h 2 1 4 c d ρ u 2 h 2 1 4 c d ρ i m where c d is the drag coefficient c d is 1 0 or 2 1 respectively depending on whether the fluid force corresponds to a cylinder or a flat plate ρ density of fluid h tsunami inundation depth u depth averaged velocity and i f and i m are the fluid force index u 2 h and moment index u 2 h 2 respectively as shown in eqs 1 and 2 the two indices can represent the fundamental fluid force characteristics of flows multiplying the c d density of fluid and coefficient of the index can express the fluid force and the moment the fluid force index u 2 h and moment index u 2 h 2 were also utilized to determine the breaking or washout condition of houses tanaka et al 2014 2 3 methods for evaluating overflow volume from embankment 2 3 1 series a experiments cases n e t40b t40be et40b for cases n e t40b et40b overflow discharge q vhb was calculated from the measured values where v and h were the velocity and water depth at g3 respectively and b was the channel width the overflow volume was derived by integrating the overflow discharge in time for case t40be as the flow became subcritical when the flow passed through the forest the overflow discharge was calculated by the critical depth h c and the critical velocity gh c 0 5 where g is gravitational acceleration although it is difficult to estimate the critical water depth for the unsteady condition this study defines the h c as at the center of the embankment top from the distribution of water depth at the embankment top the error was 20 for the four cases case e t40b t40be et40b with case n in series a the overflow volume was integrated in 10 s because the overflow was almost finished and needed to be compared with the same time in case n where reflected waves from the channel wall can be neglected did not reach the investigated region 2 3 2 series b and c experiments case e t2b e t2t e t2s e t2b of e t2b or e in these series experiments the model with two rows of trees was used and the difference in overflow volume was small thus the overflow volume was measured directly by making a retention pool behind the embankment calibration curves for the water depth in the pool and the reserved volume were made and the water depth in the pool was measured in each experiment 3 results 3 1 changes in overflow volume due to combination and location of embankment and coastal forest series a experiments 3 1 1 non dimensional overflow volume v n v v n in series a experiments v n v v n for series a experiments case e t40b t40be et40b are shown in fig 5 in relation to the non dimensional wave height at g2 due to the effect of the arrangement of embankment and forest the non dimensional overflow volume v n in case t40be was smaller than that in case et40b therefore a sea side coastal forest is able to reduce the overflow volume from the embankment by reflecting a part of a tsunami the v n in case e were also compared with those in case t40b when the non dimensional wave heights were 0 86 1 27 and 1 64 v n in case e were 0 29 0 51 and 0 65 respectively and v n in case t40b for the same heights were 0 58 0 63 and 0 59 respectively when the non dimensional wave heights were small i e 0 86 and 1 27 v n in case e were smaller than that in case t40b however the trend was opposite for the cases when the non dimensional wave height was large 1 64 this is because the reflection and transmission patterns were different for each case for case e in which a part of the tsunami current was reflected the overflow flux was not much increased in comparison with the increase in the non dimensional wave height for case t40b when the non dimensional wave height at g2 h was large the water depth at the vegetation became large and the reflection was increased by the increased resistance thus the reflection was increased with the increasing h and v n took similar values for the increase in h to clarify the effect of vegetation behind an embankment the v n in case et40b were compared with those in case e the reason why the v n in case et40b had smaller values than those in case e is that the overflow current from the embankment was tentatively stored in front of the vegetation by resistance and reflection and part of the stored water overflowed again when the tsunami water depth at the top of embankment decreased h 1 64 moreover because v n is defined during the 10 s after the current arrived at g1 the volume was slightly underestimated in case et40b in which the arrival to g3 was delayed due to resistance by the vegetation although an overflow of the embankment from vegetation to the sea side did not occur h 0 86 1 27 3 1 2 time series of reflected waves time series of water depths at g2 for cases e t40b et40b and t40b e are shown in fig 6 for the non dimensional wave height h of 0 86 the time series of water depths for case n is also shown for comparison when h was 0 86 the time series of water depths including the reflected wave was almost the same for the two cases case e and case et40b in case et40b reflection occurred in front of the vegetated region after the water overtopped the embankment when h was 1 64 the reflected wave overflowed the embankment again but when h was 0 86 the water accumulation in the vegetation front was shallower than the embankment height thus overflow from the vegetation side did not occur and the reflected waves were almost identical however v n for case e was slightly larger than that in case et40b in fig 5 this is due to the delay effect of 40 rows of vegetation because the volume is calculated during the 10 s to g3 after the wave arrived at g1 elapsed time fig 7 shows the time series of overflow volume for cases n e and et40b this shows that the overflow volume for case e was large during the elapsed time of 3 6 s and suddenly declined at around 6 8 s on the other hand the overflow volume for case et40b h 0 86 gradually increased during the elapsed time of 3 5 6 s and gradually decreased afterwards after 7 s the overflow volume for case et40b was slightly larger than that for case e this delay caused the decrease of volume at 10 s shown in fig 5 but actually the volume was the same when the elapsed time was extended to measure all the overflow water as already explained in 3 1 1 3 1 3 fluid force index and moment index fig 8 a 8b shows comparisons of the fluid force index and moment index defined in eqs 1 and 2 for each case for both indexes case et40 shows the minimum value these two indexes are representative parameters to express the breaking condition of houses tanaka et al 2014 this point will be discussed later 3 2 effect of 2 row sea side forests on changing overflow volume from embankment series b experiment v e v v e in series b experiments cases t2be t2te t2se are shown in fig 9 in relation to non dimensional wave height at g2 3 2 1 non dimensional overflow volume v e v v e in case t2be fig 9 shows that v e declined around 10 20 irrespective of l te fig 10 shows time series of reflected waves at g1 for case t2be and case e the first reflected wave shown in arrow a is from the bed slope and the maximum depth is from the embankment arrow b for case t2be a reflection by vegetation was not observed however the water passed through and increased behind the vegetation and was reflected when the reflected wave from the embankment passed through the vegetation to the sea side arrow c shows the reflected wave pattern the maximum water depth was slightly larger in case t2be compared with case e and the reflected wave arrival time was also slightly faster although it was not clear because the reflection occurred soon after the reflection from the slope thus it is reasonable to consider that v e was decreased for case t2be compared with case e fig 9 3 2 2 v e in case t2te and case t2se effect of tree location for case t2te the accumulation of water between the vegetation and the embankment that occurred in case t2be was not seen however the overflow volume was decreased by around 5 10 fig 9 it is assumed that the run up flow on the embankment slope decreases the froude number and afterwards the resistance at the top of the embankment reflects part of the water however in case t2se v e exceeded 1 when h was 0 86 this means that the overflow volume was increased by the existence of vegetation on the slope the reflection in case t2se is assumed to be small compared with that in case t2te because the accumulated water was low it also possibly decreased the resistance of the embankment and reflection by the embankment itself because the vegetation changed the flow direction slightly upward reflection by vegetation increased with increasing h but v e was not much affected by h because the reflected area was the same therefore v e decreased with increasing h as shown in fig 9 3 3 effect of sea side overturning 2 row forest on changing overflow volume from embankment series c experiment v e v v e in series c experiments cases t2b ofe t2b ore is shown in fig 11 in relation to the non dimensional wave height at g2 3 3 1 v e in case t2b ofe effect of tree overturning in tsunami event v e for the overturning type was not much changed i e case t2b ofe when h was 1 64 fig 11 when the forest was overturned and resistance was decreased the water depth behind the vegetation did not increase and reflection by the embankment was dominant on the other hand v e was decreased around 20 for an h of 0 86 this value was similar to case t2be this will be discussed later considering the flow mechanism in greater detail 3 3 2 v e in case t2b ore effect of timing of tree overturning in tsunami event the effect of the timing of tree overturning changed in case t2b ore where the overturning occurred just before the reflected wave arrived for l te 3 55 compared the case t2b ore l te 3 55 fig 11 with the freely overturned type case v2b ofe l te 3 55 v e in case t2b ore decreased around 3 for h 0 86 and 1 27 and 1 5 for h 1 64 4 discussion 4 1 difference in non dimensional overflow volumes the relationship between the reflection and overflow volume is discussed first fig 12 shows photos taken immediately after the reflection had occurred for case t40b and case t40be fig 12a the current intruded as a super critical condition and increased the water depth inside the vegetation only 2 3 rows from the landside front of vegetation after that the reflection occurred when sea side vegetation is thin a tsunami easily passes through the vegetation as super critical flow and the reflection cannot be expected to increase however v e decreased around 10 20 this is the combined effect of vegetation and embankment when the current passed through the vegetation the water depth increased slightly and then decreased fig 12b 1 the water again was pushed upward by the existence of the embankment slope and the stored or delayed water went toward the sea together fig 12b 2 with the reflected wave that was generated at the top of the embankment this mechanism increased the reflection and decreased the overflow volume the differences in the effect of length between the tree model edge and embankment model edge were small in this case a storage space where downward flow behind vegetation and upward flow on the slope can be generated was important and the length was adequate in our experimental cases for the overturning type v e was less than 1 when h was small fig 12c this is similar to the mechanism for the standing type however when the h was large the effect decreased fig 12d and the v e was not much changed with the case e fig 13 shows the relationship between the ratio of reduction in overflow volume v for different non dimensional wave heights h at g2 for every h v in case t40be was far larger than in other cases fig 13b shows that when h at g2 was 0 86 v defined as v per row was larger in t2 cases than those in 40 row cases except for case t2se as already discussed vegetation has some capacity to decrease the reflection from the slope except for this case not only the reflection but also the combined effect with trees and embankment was assumed to be present even when tree destruction occurs when h at g2 was 0 86 v was large because the inclined circular cylinders still can provide drag forces to the flow poulin and larsen 2007 thuy et al 2012 many previous post tsunami surveys indicated the effectiveness of coastal vegetation for tsunami disaster mitigation danielsen et al 2005 mascarenhas and jayakumar 2008 nandasena et al 2012 tanaka 2012 tanaka et al 2014 even though a forest has limitations due to the possibility of its destruction and production of driftwood shuto 1987 dengler and preuss 2003 although dao et al 2014 showed the effectiveness of an embankment in the great east japan tsunami not many studies were conducted of compound defenses composed of an embankment coastal forest and or ditches except for post tsunami surveys and its evaluations tanaka et al 2014 tokida and tanimoto 2014 usman et al 2014 in most cases of compound defenses a rear side forest was proposed to be more vulnerable when a sea side embankment did not exist tanaka 2012 however a beach forest forest on sand dunes or mangroves sometimes plays an important role in the landscape in tropical countries moreover this type of forest can be constructed in some cases even where land is limited an actual planting in sri lanka showed the difficulties in constructing a thick forest because of the land limitation tanaka et al 2011 in that case a thin front side forest was a viable option to strengthen the mitigating function of the available land a thin forest also has the advantage of requiring smaller spacing between trees because light availability does not much affect tree growth compared with a thick forest this study showed a clear advantage of a frontside forest to reduce the overtopping flow from an embankment thus reducing the size of the inundated area in the destruction of a coastal forest in front of embankment a tree has a high likelihood of being broken in a huge tsunami when there is no embankment on the sea side tanaka 2012 even when the trees were overturned our experiment showed the effectiveness of a forest when the approaching tsunami height was less than the embankment height although most of the destroyed trees remained in place even though they were overturned or bent erosion was not severe tanaka 2012 however more study is needed because a forest may be broken not only by the push wave but also by the reflected wave from landward huang et al 2013 in addition more study of the forest structure itself is needed a previous study indicated the effects of the inside structure of a forest on energy loss pasha and tanaka 2017 reported the importance of tree density and forest length on flow pattern and energy loss noarayanan et al 2012 investigated the friction factor and energy loss due to vegetation in a flow especially paying attention to the oscillation phenomena with the change of vfp which includes all the vegetation and flow characteristics proposed in their study 4 2 fluid force reduction this study indicated the effectiveness of a sea side coastal forest to reduce the overflow volume from the embankment even when the forest is thin and trees are overturned in a tsunami event compared with a landside coastal forest with an embankment however as shown in fig 8 the fluid force index behind the embankment in case t40be was larger than that in case et40b the tsunami fluid force greatly affected the comparatively fragile buildings in the great east japan tsunami suppasri et al 2013 when a tsunami overflowed an embankment large scoured areas or ditches were generated behind the sea embankment tappin et al 2012 tokida and tanimoto 2014 and river embankment tanaka and sato 2015 some houses just behind the coastal forest remained standing in the 2011 tsunami due to the reduction of fluid force by the coastal forest including the trapping function of floating debris tanaka 2012 tanaka et al 2013 considering this effect if the land is available a coastal forest behind an embankment has the advantage of reducing the fluid force if the embankment is high the advantage increases when the trees are not broken tanaka et al 2014 therefore the combination of an embankment and a coastal forest should be discussed based on the availability of land and current land utilization if the amount of land is limited and the overflow volume should be decreased a sea side forest is one viable option if the land behind an embankment can be used as a buffer zone a rear side forest is also applicable of course forests on both sides are assumed to be more advantageous but more study is needed on that point 5 summary the 2011 great east japan tsunami revealed the limits of a hard solution when it is composed of only a sea embankment thus the mitigation of a level 2 tsunami recurrence cycle of around several hundred to 1000 years is discussed in terms of a system of multiple defenses by using not only a single sea embankment but also a combination of several hard and soft solutions the objective of this study was to clarify the effectiveness of the combination of an embankment and a coastal forest for decreasing the overflow volume and fluid force behind the compound defense system flume tests using a quickly lifting gate that can produce a tsunami like bore type flow were conducted to determine the optimal arrangement the following conclusions were derived from the flume study 1 an arrangement of a thick coastal forest 40 rows and an embankment inside of which the water reflection can start has an ability to decrease the overflow volume from the embankment around 97 57 decrease from the embankment only case within the experimental range of non dimensional tsunami wave height 0 86 1 64 2 when the sea side forest is thin 2 rows the reflection cannot start inside however the up and down motion generated by the forest and embankment can increase the reflection the water stored between the forest and embankment moves together with the water reflected from the embankment the combined effects can decrease the overflow volume from the embankment around 20 10 decrease from the embankment only case within the experimental range of non dimensional tsunami wave height 0 86 1 64 3 even when the forest is thin and trees are overturned the water reflection can be increased when the approaching tsunami height is less than the embankment height 4 a landward forest from an embankment has the advantage of decreasing the fluid force just behind the forest around 80 and 67 reduction of fluid force index compared with the embankment only case for non dimensional tsunami wave heights 1 27 and 1 64 respectively and thus has a possibility of mitigating house destruction more study is needed of the driftwood production around an embankment together with investigation on the movements of driftwood and the disadvantages of these phenomena

23608,this study was aimed at establishing the load on of a circular fish cage with a chain linked copper alloy net under the action of ocean currents and waves the test cage that was used for this purpose was a 1 15 scaled down model of a real fish cage presently installed in the coastal area of korea the deformation and mooring line load of the model cage were observed under different current speeds of 0 20 40 60 and 80 cm s in a circulating water channel the mooring line load and its pattern were also examined with respect to the gap between the cage and the supporting buoy 0 no buoy 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 m respectively under the action of a 0 15 m high wave in the wave tank although the volume of the cage hardly changed the mooring line load exponentially increased with increasing current speed the addition of the supporting buoy to the cage decreased the maximum load and changed the loading pattern with the peak load apparently reduced to less than half the tank test observations were reproduced by computer simulation keywords copper alloy net performance circulating water channel wave tank 1 introduction there are presently more than 10 fish cages with copper alloy nets in the sea of korea all of which were installed within the last 4 years these cages have survived diverse adversities such as typhoons biofouling and predator attacks two out of the cages were specifically developed and installed in 2014 with the aid of grants from corporate organizations and the national institute of fisheries science nifs of korea the others were installed by corporate organizations additional cages with alloy nets for the cultivation of salmon are presently being installed with the aid of grants from a corporate organization and the korean government however owing to the limited available information on fish cages with copper alloy nets new ones are usually designed and installed by referencing information on existing cages with fabric nets several studies have been conducted on cages with fabric nets to analyze their characteristics under sea conditions klebert et al 2012 and investigate the performances of scaled and full size versions against currents and waves decew et al 2013 fredriksson et al 2004 kim et al 2002 the movement and hydrodynamic performance of such cages have also been investigated by computer and model tests lee et al 2008 decew et al 2010 the findings of previous studies have contributed to the development of a new ocean cage as for fish cages with copper alloy nets studies have mostly focused on demonstrating the benefits of using the net material powell and stillman 2009 nash et al 2000 powell 1976 swift et al 2006 particularly about its anti biofouling properties some recent studies however have been conducted to figure out the hydrodynamic characteristics of a copper alloy net for example tsukrov et al 2011 and cha et al 2013 investigated the differing hydrodynamic characteristics of copper alloy and fabric nets with a particular emphasis on their drag coefficients whereas it is obvious that the movement and shape of a fish cage on the sea will vary based on characteristics of the net material it is difficult to predict the specific changes in this study the performance of a scale down model cage with a copper alloy net was investigate against currents and waves the findings are expected to contribute to the design and installation of new fish cage systems 2 materials and methods the test cage deayang co korea was a 1 15 scaled down model of a real cage with a copper alloy net copper 65 zinc 35 poongsan co korea which has been currently in place in the south sea of korea see fig 1 and table 1 we scaled it down by using the froude similarity method the materials of the real and model cages were the same although the sinkers were different the sinkers of the real cage were made from concrete while those of the model cage were made from sus 304 the stiffness of the rope also depends on its material thickness and the shape of twist in addition it seldom happens when the copper alloy cage is moored at one point so the specifications of the buoy and mooring lines of the model cage used for this test were arbitrarily decided however the total buoyancy rate of the model cage and the length to diameter ratios of its mesh and rims were the same as those of the actual cage 2 1 performance under current action fig 2 shows the experimental setup used to investigate the performance of the cage under the action of water currents the experiment was performed in a circulating water channel 25 12 l 4 50 w 8 27 h m test region 8 0 2 8 1 4 m current speed 0 2 3 m s at nifs 2 positions of load cell were tested at the surface 2a on fig 2 and 60 cm below the surface 2b on fig 2 the mooring line was 1 m long currents of 20 40 60 and 80 cm s were considered respectively the load on the mooring line was measured by a load cell 40 k senstech co korea max capacity 40 kgf resolution 0 01 kgf against the current the load cell data which were originally received in v at a frequency of 200 were converted into kgf for performance comparison a model of a conventional cage with a fabric net of the same size as the model cage with the copper alloy net was also built and tested table 2 gives the specifications of the model fabric net cage which is similar to those of the copper alloy net 2 2 performance under wave action the model cage with the copper alloy net was tested under the action of waves in a wave tank 80 l 10 w 3 5 d m at nifs a load cell 40 k senstech co korea max capacity 40 kgf resolution 0 01 kgf was attached to the mooring line at the bottom of the tank fig 3 waves of height 0 15 m and frequencies of 1 1 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 s were respectively considered wave length was 2 0 for the period of 1 1 3 5 for 1 5 6 0 for 2 0 and 9 2 m for 2 5 s respectively the gap between the cage and the supporting buoy daeyang co korea d 240 mm was also varied 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 m respectively the buoy was installed on the water surface the case of not using a buoy was also considered the load cell data which were also originally received in v were converted into kgf fig 3 shows the experimental setup we employed load data was started to save after the first wave meet the collar however the data we used for analysis were those obtained after the wave had passed the cage 5 7 times this is because the cage needed time to settle against wave when the wave stopped the cage and its buoy were close to each other 2 3 simulation the movement of the test fish cage was also simulated using a computer the simplified simulation of the present study utilized a mass spring model lee et al 2008 fig 4 illustrates the modeling of the copper alloy net the cage and the buoy with the mooring ropes were modeled as mass points and springs all the mass points had physical properties such as buoyancy projected area and mass with added mass the added masses buoyancies and drags of the cage and buoy were particularly varied with respect to the submergence depth because the displacement of a floating object under wave action changes with time and the wave conditions such as wave height and period the added mass and buoyancy of a floating object are proportional to their submerged volume in the case of the buoy the submerged volume was calculated by assuming a representative virtual sphere on the mass point p1 this was because the buoy employed in the experiments was spherical fig 5 a a circular area is created at the plane at which the surface crosses the sphere as illustrated in fig 5a where p2p3 is the radius of the circle the submerged volume was thus calculated by integrating the expression of the area of a circle between h and r equation 1 in the case of the cage the submerged volume which varied under the action of the wave comprised the upper pipe the upper pipe is torus shaped but was simplified as a cylinder in this study sheard et al 2005 johnson and wu 1979 a virtual cylinder was therefore assumed on the mass point q1 which represented the cage including the upper pipe the physical properties of the upper pipe netting lower pipe and weights were included in the mass point q1 all parts with the exception of the upper pipe were assumed to be always submerged and their added mass buoyancy and projected area were thus constant it was also assumed that the submerged depth of the upper pipe in the length direction would be constant hence a circular cross sectional area was also considered in calculating the submerged volume of the cage fig 5b the area of the submerged part was determined as twice the difference between the area of the section oq1q2 and the triangle oq2q3 where q2q3 is a line created by the intersection between the surface line and the cross section of the cylinder see equation 2 and fig 5b these parameters were used to calculate the ratios of the submerged volume to the total volume for the buoy and upper pipe of the cage respectively the ratios were also used to determine the added masses buoyancies and drag forces of these parts with respect to their displacements for example a ratio of 0 5 for the buoy implied that half of it was submerged hence the buoyancy and added mass were reduced by 50 respectively the coefficients of the added masses of the buoy and upper pipe used for the simulation were 0 5 and 1 0 respectively 1 v h r π r 2 y 2 dy 2 s r 2 θ hrsinθ the drag force on a flowing object is proportional to its projected area which also varies with the displacement of the object it was assumed that the projected area of the buoy was circular while that of the upper pipe was rectangular the submerged circular projected area was calculated using the same method applied to the cross sectional area of the submerged cylinder described above fig 5a based on the generally accepted 0 5 drag coefficient of a sphere the drag coefficient of the buoy was considered to be 0 5 it is however difficult to determine the drag coefficient of an entire fish cage because of the various constituent parts such as the netting pipes and weights in this study it was indirectly estimated from the experimentally measured tension in the mooring line during constant flow fig 10 shows the measured tension although the current speed range was 0 2 0 8 m s only the data for 0 8 m s was used for the simulation together with 60 cm mooring under these conditions the cage was almost entirely submerged the drag force was determined from the x component of the tension in the mooring line the cage drag force was obtained by calculating the drag force on the upper pipe and subtracting it from the total drag force the drag coefficient of an object is usually calculated using equation 3 morison et al 1950 however a new modified coefficient k that takes the projected area s into consideration is given by equations 4 and 5 because the projected area is constant and the theoretically determined value for the present cage was inaccurate due to the complex structure the calculated coefficient k of the cage without the upper pipe was 0 73 in equation 3 f is the drag force c d is the drag coefficient ρ is the density of water s is the projected area and u is the fluid speed relative to the object 3 c d 2 f ρ s u 2 4 k c d s 5 k 2 f ρu 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance under current action deformation by water current is one of the challenges ocean fish cages face and the phenomenon was investigated by decew et al 2013 the decreased volume caused by the deformation of the cage reduces the volume available for fish and the decreased porosity effectiveness due to the deformation of the net hampers water flow through the cage rigid cages are used to improve this problem beveridge 2004 the copper alloy nets were hardly deformed under the action of water current fig 6 this involves the use of single yarns that extend from the top of the cage to the bottom and chain links without the use of nodes which are employed in a fabric net fig 6 hence when the current presses on one side of the cage resulting in the generation of a lift force at the bottom the yarns resist the bending of the cage in addition when the net is deformed and the bottom of the cage is lifted the bottom tends to slightly twist from the float rim to reduce the resistance to bending by directing the upper and lower ends of the yarns away from each other because this is easier than bending the yarns to help their ends meet each other this can be compared to when a steel bar is bended by hands it is easier when the ends miss each other than when they meet this is because of the larger bending angle in other words when the cage is deformed under the action of current the bottom naturally rotates unlike a fabric net cage that simply bends figs 7 and 8 therefore if the two types of cages of the same size are installed in the same culture area the one with the copper alloy net would culture more fish because of its greater resistance to deformation fig 9 to achieve the same volume of the two types of cages under a given current the weight at the bottom of the cage with the fabric net would have to be greater and this would require the use of stronger nets and mooring lines to bear the increased weight however the float of the copper cage would sink deeper by the high speed of the current because the shape of the cage hardly changes when moored under water when the mooring is set under water the direction is into the water which is the direction of the mooring line and the floating collar is pulled to the point under fast current then the fish in the cage will escape through the submerged top of the cage in the other case the collar is hard to sink under the current because the direction is to the surface thus even though the cage gets pressed to surface like the last shot of the surface on fig 6 the sinking will be limited because the opposite side of the collar has to push out over the surface due to hardly deformation of the net in addition if the mooring system has four surface buoys at a 90 interval the opposite mooring against current can restrain push out the part of collar the load on the mooring line for an underwater mooring is higher than that for the surface mooring because the area projected against the current is larger due to the sinking of the upper part fig 10 shows the dependency of the mooring line load on the current speed for both surface and underwater mooring therefore when a fish cage with a copper net is installed in a high speed current area a surface supporting buoy should be added to the mooring system however more than one mooring line is often attached to an ocean cage and further study is thus required for appropriate positioning of the buoy the required buoyancy of the buoy and distance between the buoy and the cage will be investigated in the next stage of our study for application to the development of real cages 3 2 experimental and simulation mooring line load under wave action fig 11 shows the load on the mooring line of the cage under different wave conditions the load data were synchronized with the period of the waves as the figure shows all the wave conditions produced one peak load with the load decreasing with increasing period when the buoy was not used this behavior is similar to that of a fabric net cage tsukrov et al 2003 lee et al 2008 xu et al 2011 the highest loads on the mooring line were distributed over several peaks when using the buoy for wave periods shorter than 2 s in addition the highest loads were significantly reduced compared to when the buoy was not used the reduced load on the mooring line when using a buoy has also been observed for a fabric net cage lekang 2007 the reduction of the peak load by using a buoy in this study roughly decreased with increasing period with load reductions of about 70 80 30 50 and 45 55 observed at frequencies of 1 1 1 5 and 2 s respectively the peak load was reduced without distribution at the longest period of 2 5 s the load reduction thus appeared to be more dependent on the period than the gap between the cage and the buoy hence whereas the loading shape and peak load varied with the period the above results confirm that the buoy can be used to reduce the load on the mooring line regardless of the gap between buoy and the cage or the wave period however the gap also affected the magnitude of the load reduction with the largest reductions for gaps of 1 0 0 5 and 2 0 m occurring at wave frequencies of 1 1 1 5 and 2 0 s respectively it is difficult to find a research about the distribution like these results cha et al 2016 presented that if the surface buoy and float which was a lighting buoy are connected they affect each other s movement in addition the research said that the degree of influence is determined by the distance between the float and surface buoy and the condition of the wave however the mooring system for the cage was different with the lighting buoy system because the lighting buoy and surface buoy were similar in size and bouncy but the cage was bigger in size and bouncy than the surface buoys therefore the results of this experiment should be verified by reliable methods like computer simulation based calculation fig 12 shows loads of the mooring lines determined by simulation the black graph shows the results of the load on the main mooring line which is connected between the buoy and bottom on the tank as in the experiment the red graph is about the result of the load on the surface mooring line that connects the buoy and the cage although the loads determined by simulation are larger than those determined by experiment for all the considered conditions they consistently peaked when the buoy was not used while they were distributed when using the buoy the difference in magnitude is attributed to the simplified simulation and possibly the larger experimental added masses which hampered the movement of the buoy because the water captured by the cage was determined by its volume however the simulation was sufficiently accurate for the present purpose which was to confirm the load distribution observed in the experiment the load distributions on the surface mooring line were more complicated than the other loads because of the interaction between the cage and the buoy while the load on the main mooring line is determined only by the buoy movement both the cage and the buoy were moved by wave some peaks of them were higher than those of the main mooring lines when the two floaters move in different directions the load reaches the maximum value the meaning of two floaters move in different directions is that the buoy moves to the direction the wave comes which means that it rarely occurs when the black graph and the red graph together are at their maximum values because if the buoy moves to the direction the wave comes the distance between the buoy and bottom gets closer and then the tension on the line from the bottom to the buoy is reduced fig 13 shows relations between the load of the surface mooring line and the main mooring line when the peak load on the surface mooring line is higher than that of the main mooring line as result of this simulation the distribution is a general phenomenon and that simulation can help us understand the role of the buoy in more detail however more accurate simulation is essential for the mooring system with the buoy to establish the specifications of a real full size fish cage system it is difficult to find the distribution from previous studies fredriksson et al 2004 huang et al 2007 as distribution does not occur at 2 5 m s which is the longest wave period of the model experiment the typical wave period at the ocean is considerably long compared to the size of the cage system thus only one peak load occurs on a mooring line however if the culture area is exposed to a strong regional wind such as a typhoon the surface wavelength and period would be reduced the buoy is also expected to reduce the load when the sea condition is severe further study is thus necessary to investigate the optimal gap between the cage and the buoy with respect to the sea conditions such investigation should also consider a fabric net cage although a buoy is more beneficial for a copper alloy net cage which is characterized by a larger mooring line load under the action of a water current with the load amplified by the presence of a wave thus it has been demonstrated that the mooring line load varies with the wave conditions this indicates that the cage performance under the action of a wave can be predicted provided the wave pattern in the culture area is known the results also indicate that it is preferable to set the buoy of a fish cage in an area with high and fast waves however the present study did not identify the exact reason for the reduced mooring line load when using a buoy under these conditions addressing this question requires several additional tests considering different buoy sizes gaps between the buoy and the cage and wave conditions a fabric net cage performs differently when used as a floating corral under the action of a wave braaten and dahle 1988 and it can be assumed that the movement would affect the mooring line load the effect on the movement of a copper alloy net cage would be less owing to the material and structural stiffness confirmation of this postulation would require the use of video synchronization to investigate the underwater performance of the cage 4 conclusions 1 this study was aimed at establishing the load on a circular fish cage with a copper alloy net under the actions of water currents and waves the employed cage was scaled to 1 15 of the actual cage and tested in a circulating water channel and wave tank respectively 2 the volume of the cage hardly changed although the mooring line load exponentially increased with increasing current speed from 0 to 80 cm s in the circulating water channel setting the supporting buoy on the water surface reduced the mooring line load compared to setting the buoy underwater 3 the mooring line load and its pattern varied with the gap between the cage and the supporting buoy and with the wave period in the wave tank the addition of the supporting buoy to the cage decreased the peak mooring line load and altered the load pattern the peak load was apparently reduced by more than half with the addition of the buoy the load was also dependent on the period of the wave it was notable that a supporting buoy could be used to reduce the damage risk of a fishing cage with a copper alloy net under the action of short period waves such as those generated by typhoons or hurricanes 4 the experimentally determined load distribution when using a supporting buoy was confirmed by computer simulation using a mass spring model funding

23608,this study was aimed at establishing the load on of a circular fish cage with a chain linked copper alloy net under the action of ocean currents and waves the test cage that was used for this purpose was a 1 15 scaled down model of a real fish cage presently installed in the coastal area of korea the deformation and mooring line load of the model cage were observed under different current

1 1 5 and 2 m respectively under the action of a 0 15 m high wave in the wave tank although the volume of the cage hardly changed the mooring line load exponentially increased with increasing current speed the addition of the supporting buoy to the cage decreased the maximum load and changed the loading pattern with the peak load apparently reduced to less than half the tank test observations were reproduced by computer simulation keywords copper alloy net performance circulating water channel wave tank 1 introduction there are presently more than 10 fish cages with copper alloy nets in the sea of korea all of which were installed within the last 4 years these cages have survived diverse adversities such as typhoons biofouling and predator attacks two out of the cages were specifically developed and installed in 2014 with the aid of grants from corporate organizations and the national institute of fisheries science nifs of korea the others were installed by corporate organizations additional cages with alloy nets for the cultivation of salmon are presently being installed with the aid of grants from a corporate organization and the korean government however owing to the limited available information on fish cages with copper alloy nets new ones are usually designed and installed by referencing information on existing cages with fabric nets several studies have been conducted on cages with fabric nets to analyze their characteristics under sea conditions klebert et al 2012 and investigate the performances of scaled and full size versions against currents and waves decew et

findings of previous studies have contributed to the development of a new ocean cage as for fish cages with copper alloy nets studies have mostly focused on demonstrating the benefits of using the net material powell and stillman 2009 nash et al 2000 powell 1976 swift et al 2006 particularly about its anti biofouling properties some recent studies however have been conducted to figure out the hydrodynamic characteristics of a copper alloy net for example tsukrov et al 2011 and cha et al 2013 investigated the differing hydrodynamic characteristics of copper alloy and fabric nets with a particular emphasis on their drag coefficients whereas it is obvious that the movement and shape of a fish cage on the sea will vary based on characteristics of the net material it is difficult to predict the specific changes in this study the performance of a scale down model cage with a copper alloy net was investigate against currents and waves the findings are expected to contribute to the design and installation of new fish cage systems 2 materials and methods the test cage deayang co korea was a 1 15 scaled down model of a real cage with a copper alloy net copper 65 zinc 35 poongsan co korea which has been currently in place in the south sea of korea see fig 1 and table 1 we scaled it down by using the froude similarity method the materials of the real and model cages were the same although the sinkers were different the sinkers of the real cage were made from concrete while those of the model cage were made from sus 304 the stiffness of the rope also depends on its material thickness and the shape of twist in addition it seldom happens when the copper alloy cage is moored at one point so the specifications of the buoy and mooring lines of the model cage used for this test were arbitrarily decided however the total buoyancy rate of the model cage and the length to diameter ratios of its mesh and rims were the same as those of the actual cage 2 1 performance

against the current the load cell data which were originally received in v at a frequency of 200 were converted into kgf for performance comparison a model of a conventional cage with a fabric net of the same size as the model cage with the copper alloy net was also built and tested table 2 gives the specifications of the model fabric net cage which is similar to those of the copper alloy net 2 2 performance under wave action the model cage with the copper alloy net was tested under the action of waves in a wave tank 80 l 10 w 3 5 d m at nifs a load cell 40 k senstech co korea max capacity 40 kgf resolution 0 01 kgf was attached to the mooring line at the bottom of the tank fig 3 waves of height 0 15 m and frequencies of 1 1 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 s were respectively considered wave length was 2 0 for the period of 1 1 3 5 for 1 5 6 0 for 2 0 and 9 2 m for 2 5 s respectively the gap between the cage and the supporting buoy daeyang co korea d 240 mm was also varied 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 m respectively the buoy was installed on the water surface the case of not using a buoy was also considered the load cell data which were also originally received in v were converted into kgf fig 3 shows the experimental setup we employed load data was started to save after the first wave meet the collar however the data we used for analysis were those obtained after the wave had passed the cage 5 7 times this is because the cage needed time to settle against wave when the wave stopped the cage and its buoy were close to each other 2 3 simulation the movement of the test fish cage was also simulated using a computer the simplified simulation of the present study utilized a mass spring model lee et al 2008 fig 4 illustrates the modeling of the copper alloy net the cage and the buoy with the mooring ropes were modeled as mass points and springs all the mass points had physical properties such as buoyancy projected area and mass with added mass the added masses buoyancies and drags of the cage and buoy were particularly varied with respect to the submergence depth because the displacement of a floating object under wave action changes with time and the wave conditions such as wave height and period the added mass and buoyancy of a floating object are proportional to their submerged volume in the case of the buoy the submerged volume was calculated by assuming a representative virtual sphere on the mass point p1 this was because the buoy employed in the experiments was spherical fig 5 a a circular area is created at the plane at which the surface crosses the sphere as illustrated in fig 5a where p2p3 is the radius of the circle the submerged volume was thus calculated by integrating the expression of the area of a circle between h and r equation 1 in the case of the cage the submerged volume which varied under the action of the wave comprised the upper pipe the upper pipe is torus shaped but was simplified as a cylinder in this study sheard et al 2005 johnson and wu 1979 a virtual cylinder was therefore assumed on the mass point q1 which represented the cage including the upper pipe the physical properties of the upper pipe netting lower pipe and weights were included in the mass point q1 all parts with the exception of the upper pipe were assumed to be always submerged and their added mass buoyancy and projected area were thus constant it was also assumed that the submerged depth of the upper pipe in the length direction would be constant hence a circular cross sectional area was also considered in calculating the submerged volume of the cage fig 5b the area of the submerged part was determined as twice the difference between the area of the section oq1q2 and the triangle oq2q3 where q2q3 is a line created by the intersection between the surface line and the cross section of the cylinder see equation 2 and fig 5b these parameters were used to calculate the ratios of the submerged volume to the total volume for the buoy and upper pipe of the cage respectively the ratios were also used to determine the added masses buoyancies and drag forces of these parts with respect to their displacements for example a ratio of 0 5 for the buoy implied that half of it was submerged hence the buoyancy and added mass were reduced by 50 respectively the coefficients of the added masses of the buoy and upper pipe used for the simulation were 0 5 and 1 0 respectively 1 v h r π r 2 y 2 dy 2 s r 2 θ hrsinθ the drag force on a flowing object is proportional to its projected area which also varies with the displacement of the object it was assumed that the projected area of the buoy was circular while that of the upper pipe was rectangular the submerged circular projected area was calculated using the same method applied to the cross sectional area of the submerged cylinder described above fig 5a based on the generally accepted 0 5 drag coefficient of a sphere the drag coefficient of the buoy was considered to be 0 5 it is however difficult to determine the drag coefficient of an entire fish cage because of the various constituent parts such as the netting pipes and weights in this study it was indirectly estimated from the experimentally measured tension in the mooring line during constant flow fig 10 shows the measured tension although the current speed range was 0 2 0 8 m s only the data for 0 8 m s was used for the simulation together with 60 cm mooring under these conditions the cage was almost entirely submerged the drag force was determined from the x component of the tension in the mooring line the cage drag force was obtained by calculating the drag force on the upper pipe and subtracting it from the total drag force the drag coefficient of an object is usually calculated using equation 3 morison et al 1950 however a new modified coefficient k that takes the projected area s into consideration is given by equations 4 and 5 because the projected area is constant and the theoretically determined value for the present cage was inaccurate due to the complex structure the calculated coefficient k of the cage without the upper pipe was 0 73 in equation 3 f is the drag force c d is the drag coefficient ρ is the density of water s is the projected area and u is the fluid speed relative to the object 3 c d 2 f ρ s u 2 4 k c d s 5 k 2 f ρu 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance under current action deformation by water current is one of the challenges ocean fish cages face and the phenomenon was investigated by decew et al 2013 the decreased volume caused by the deformation of the cage reduces the volume available for fish and the decreased porosity effectiveness due to the deformation of the net hampers water flow through the cage rigid cages are used to improve this problem beveridge 2004 the copper alloy nets were hardly deformed under the action of water current fig 6 this involves the use of single yarns that extend from the top of the cage to the bottom and chain links without the use of nodes which are employed in a fabric net fig 6 hence when the current presses on one side of the cage resulting in the generation of a lift force at the bottom the yarns resist the bending of the cage in addition when the net is deformed and the bottom of the cage is lifted the bottom tends to slightly twist from the float rim to reduce the resistance to bending by directing the upper and lower ends of the yarns away from each other because this is easier than bending the yarns to help their ends meet each other this can be compared to when a steel bar is bended by hands it is easier when the ends miss each other than when they meet this is because of the larger bending angle in other words when the cage is deformed under the action of current the bottom naturally rotates unlike a fabric net cage that simply bends figs 7 and 8 therefore if the two types of cages of the same size are installed in the same culture area the one with the copper alloy net would culture more fish because of its greater resistance to deformation fig 9 to achieve the same volume of the two types of cages under a given current the weight at the bottom of the cage with the fabric net would have to be greater and this would require the use of stronger nets and mooring lines to bear the increased weight however the float of the copper cage would sink deeper by the high speed of the current because the shape of the cage hardly changes when moored under water when the mooring is set under water the direction is into the water which is the direction of the mooring line and the floating collar is pulled to the point under fast current then the fish in the cage will escape through the submerged top of the cage in the other case the collar is hard to sink under the current because the direction is to the surface thus even though the cage gets pressed to surface like the last shot of the surface on fig 6 the sinking will be limited because the opposite side of the collar has to push out over the surface due to hardly deformation of the net in addition if the mooring system has four surface buoys at a 90 interval the opposite mooring against current can restrain push out the part of collar the load on the mooring line for an underwater mooring is higher than that for the surface mooring because the area projected against the current is larger due to the sinking of the upper part fig 10 shows the dependency of the mooring line load on the current speed for both surface and underwater mooring therefore when a fish cage with a copper net is installed in a high speed current area a surface supporting buoy should be added to the mooring system however more than one mooring line is often attached to an ocean cage and further study is thus required for appropriate positioning of the buoy the required buoyancy of the buoy and distance between the buoy and the cage will be investigated in the next stage of our study for application to the development of real cages 3 2 experimental and simulation mooring line load under wave action fig 11 shows the load on the mooring line of the cage under different wave conditions the load data were synchronized with the period of the waves as the figure shows all the wave conditions produced one peak load with the load decreasing with increasing period when the buoy was not used this behavior is similar to that of a fabric net cage tsukrov et al 2003 lee et al 2008 xu et al 2011 the highest loads on the mooring line were distributed over several peaks when using the buoy for wave periods shorter than 2 s in addition the highest loads were significantly reduced compared to when the buoy was not used the reduced load on the mooring line when using a buoy has also been observed for a fabric net cage lekang 2007 the reduction of the peak load by using a buoy in this study roughly decreased with increasing period with load reductions of about 70 80 30 50 and 45 55 observed at frequencies of 1 1 1 5 and 2 s respectively the peak load was reduced without distribution at the longest period of 2 5 s the load reduction thus appeared to be more dependent on the period than the gap between the cage and the buoy hence whereas the loading shape and peak load varied with the period the above results confirm that the buoy can be used to reduce the load on the mooring line regardless of the gap between buoy and the cage or the wave period however the gap also affected the magnitude of the load reduction with the largest reductions for gaps of 1 0 0 5 and 2 0 m occurring at wave frequencies of 1 1 1 5 and 2 0 s respectively it is difficult to find a research about the distribution like these results cha et al 2016 presented that if the surface buoy and float which was a lighting buoy are connected they affect each other s movement in addition the research said that the degree of influence is determined by the distance between the float and surface buoy and the condition of the wave however the mooring system for the cage was different with the lighting buoy system because the lighting buoy and surface buoy were similar in size and bouncy but the cage was bigger in size and bouncy than the surface buoys therefore the results of this experiment should be verified by reliable methods like computer simulation based calculation fig 12 shows loads of the mooring lines determined by simulation the black graph shows the results of the load on the main mooring line which is connected between the buoy and bottom on the tank as in the experiment the red graph is about the result of the load on the surface mooring line that connects the buoy and the cage although the loads determined by simulation are larger than those determined by experiment for all the considered conditions they consistently peaked when the buoy was not used while they were distributed when using the buoy the difference in magnitude is attributed to the simplified simulation and possibly the larger experimental added masses which hampered the movement of the buoy because the water captured by the cage was determined by its volume however the simulation was sufficiently accurate for the present purpose which was to confirm the load distribution observed in the experiment the load distributions on the surface mooring line were more complicated than the other loads because of the interaction between the cage and the buoy while the load on the main mooring line is determined only by the buoy movement both the cage and the buoy were moved by wave some peaks of them were higher than those of the main mooring lines when the two floaters move in different directions the load reaches the maximum value the meaning of two floaters move in different directions is that the buoy moves to the direction the wave comes which means that it rarely occurs when the black graph and the red graph together are at their maximum values because if the buoy moves to the direction the wave comes the distance between the buoy and bottom gets closer and then the tension on the line from the bottom to the buoy is reduced fig 13 shows relations between the load of the surface mooring line and the main mooring line when the peak load on the surface mooring line is higher than that of the main mooring line as result of this simulation the distribution is a general phenomenon and that simulation can help us understand the role of the buoy in more detail however more accurate simulation is essential for the mooring system with the buoy to establish the specifications of a real full size fish cage system it is difficult to find the distribution from previous studies fredriksson et al 2004 huang et al 2007 as distribution does not occur at 2 5 m s which is the longest wave period of the model experiment the typical wave period at the ocean is considerably long compared to the size of the cage system thus only one peak load occurs on a mooring line however if the culture area is exposed to a strong regional wind such as a typhoon the surface wavelength and period would be reduced the buoy is also expected to reduce the load when the sea condition is severe further study is thus necessary to investigate the optimal gap between the cage and the buoy with respect to the sea conditions such investigation should also consider a fabric net cage although a buoy is more beneficial for a copper alloy net cage which is characterized by a larger mooring line load under the action of a water current with the load amplified by the presence of a wave thus it has been demonstrated that the mooring line load varies with the wave conditions this indicates that the cage performance under the action of a wave can be predicted provided the wave pattern in the culture area is known the results also indicate that it is preferable to set the buoy of a fish cage in an area with high and fast waves however the present study did not identify the exact reason for the reduced mooring line load when using a buoy under these conditions addressing this question requires several additional tests considering different buoy sizes gaps between the buoy and the cage and wave conditions a fabric net cage performs differently when used as a floating corral under the action of a wave braaten and dahle 1988 and it can be assumed that the movement would affect the mooring line load the effect on the movement of a copper alloy net cage would be less owing to the material and structural stiffness confirmation of this postulation would require the use of video synchronization to investigate the underwater performance of the cage 4 conclusions 1 this study was aimed at establishing the load on a circular fish cage with a copper alloy net under the actions of water currents and waves the employed cage was scaled to 1 15 of the actual cage and tested in a circulating water channel and wave tank respectively 2 the volume of the cage hardly changed although the mooring line load exponentially increased with increasing current speed from 0 to 80 cm s in the circulating water channel setting the supporting buoy on the water surface reduced the mooring line load compared to setting the buoy underwater 3 the mooring line load and its pattern varied with the gap between the cage and the supporting buoy and with the wave period in the wave tank the addition of the supporting buoy to the cage decreased the peak mooring line load and altered the load pattern the peak load was apparently reduced by more than half with the addition of the buoy the load was also dependent on the period of the wave it was notable that a supporting buoy could be used to reduce the damage risk of a fishing cage with a copper alloy net under the action of short period waves such as those generated by typhoons or hurricanes 4 the experimentally determined load distribution when using a supporting buoy was confirmed by computer simulation using a mass spring model funding

23609,this experimental study examines the wake flow and the flow induced vibration of an elastically supported circular cylinder referred to as test cylinder of diameter d and then the suppression of the flow induced vibration by a control cylinder of diameter 0 5d installed behind the circular test cylinder is investigated at reynolds number re 1 4 104 3 2 104 corresponding to the reduced velocity u r 0 4 22 the streamwise and lateral separations of the control cylinder from the test cylinder center are varied as 0 2d 1 1d and 0 1 7d respectively the vortex trail encompassing the vortex generation to the disappearance in the wake of the test cylinder is identified by means of wake energy distributions obtained from power spectra of fluctuating streamwise velocities based on the energy distributions the control cylinder positions are determined to suppress the flow induced vibration the process of vortex generation growth disappearance in the wake of a vibrating cylinder occurs closer to the cylinder compared to that of a non vibrating cylinder the lateral separation between the two rows of vortices for a vibrating cylinder is found to be smaller the controlled vibration responses of the cylinder are classified into four patterns i ii iii and iv depending on the control cylinder position patterns i and ii both self limited amplitude vibrations are characterized by the occurrence of vibrations at a smaller and a larger u r respectively compared to the non controlled counterpart pattern iii represents an increasing vibration amplitude with an increase in u r resembling a galloping vibration pattern iv features vibration suppression resulting from the suppression of the karman street in the wake this regime is divided into two subregimes iv a and iv b while the interaction between the gap flow and freestream side shear layer of the test cylinder succeeds in the suppression of the karman street in pattern iv a that between the gap shear layer and the control cylinder gives rise to the suppression of the karman street in pattern iv b keywords cross flow vibration vortex efflux angle circular cylinder suppression 1 introduction circular cylindrical structures are commonly seen in our daily lives such as risers bridge piers pipelines most of which stand against flowing fluids the alternate vortex shedding from the structures may produce a large fluctuating pressure on the structures causing structural vibrations acoustic noise and even resonance which can trigger structural failure numerous failures in the practical applications of cylindrical structures in cross flow are illustrated in chen 1987 paıdoussis 1993 and blevins 1990 the cost associated with a typical engineering structural failure can easily reach the order of one million dollars and even billions of dollars naturally there is a pressing need to study and to understand the fluid dynamics associated with multiple cylindrical structures in cross flow accordingly many studies have delved into the interaction between flowing fluid and structures flow induced vibrations of two identical diameter cylinders in tandem staggered and side by side arrangements are studied by kim et al 2009a alam and kim 2009 and kim and alam 2015 respectively where they found that flow induced vibration characteristics of the cylinders are highly contingent on the cylinder arrangement and spacing between the cylinders kim and alam 2015 for two side by side identical cylinders identified four vibration response patterns namely i the two cylinders vibrating at a large amplitude in the same range of u r at 0 1 t 0 2 ii no vibration generated for either cylinder at 0 2 t 0 9 iii the two cylinders vibrating at different ranges of u r at 0 9 t 2 1 and iv each cylinder response resembling an isolated cylinder response at 2 1 t 3 2 where t is the cylinder gap spacing ratio lam and to 2003 performed an experimental study where the downstream cylinder was flexible and half in diameter than the upstream cylinder no vibration was observed the cause of no vibration was attributed to the fact that the upstream cylinder of being larger diameter shelters the downstream cylinder tu et al 2014 numerically studied flow induced vibrations of an elastically mounted circular cylinder subjected to a planar shear flow with the single only cross flow direction and two degree of freedoms both in line and cross flow directions in the laminar flow re 150 the effects of shear rate k 0 0 0 1 reduced velocity u r 3 0 12 0 and natural frequency ratio r 1 0 2 0 on the characteristics of vortex induced vibration viv responses were studied chen et al 2013 investigated the viv of a circular cylinder under a suction flow reporting an optimal suction flow rate at which viv was completely suppressed the rotary oscillation control can be implemented to suppress the response amplitude of viv by locking the vortex shedding frequency at the forcing frequency using a traveling wave wall method xu et al 2014 focused on the suppression of the viv of an elastically supported circular cylinder with a two degree of freedom at a low re 200 to investigate the feasibility for the flow control around a cylinder strykowski and sreenivasan 1990 used a control cylinder of the diameter ranging from 0 05d to 0 33d and observed that a placement of a smaller cylinder in the near wake of the cylinder can alter the vortex shedding the temporal growth rate of disturbances was weakened and drag was reduced zhao et al 2007 performed a similar numerical investigation using a control cylinder of diameter 0 5d sakamoto et al 1991 examined the suppression of the fluid forces by adding a control cylinder in a shear layer of a square cylinder the reduction was however more for the fluctuating forces than for the time mean forces 95 for fluctuating lift 75 for fluctuating drag and only 30 for time mean drag wu et al 2012 conducted experiments with a focus on vibration suppression of a deepwater riser by using four control cylinders each of diameter of 0 25d the vibration was suppressed for certain configurations the mechanism of vibration suppression however remained unclear igarashi and terachi 2002 examined the wake of a flat plate adding a control cylinder of diameter 0 04 0 4 d and found a larger reduction in drag for a larger diameter control cylinder wu et al 2014 numerically investigated viv characteristics of a cylinder controlled by a hinged flat plate the addition of the hinged plate efficiently suppressed the viv of and force fluctuations on the cylinder an active control method for suppressing viv response of an elastically mounted cylinder by forcing rotary oscillation was presented by du and sun 2015 kim et al 2009b used tripwires to suppress viv and galloping vibrations of a single and two tandem cylinders tripping wire positions α measured from the leading stagnation line of the cylinder were changed from α 20 to 60 to determine the optimum range of α for suppressing structural vibrations the vibrations on both cylinders were completely suppressed for α 20 30 lu et al 2014 in a laminar flow investigated the effect of rod to cylinder spacing ratio rod and cylinder diameter ratio re and angle of attack on the main circular cylinder it was observed that the range of the spacing ratio where significant force suppression is achieved becomes narrower as the re increases in the laminar regime but was insensitive to the diameter ratio among the studies delving into the topics associated with circular cylinders the studies that examined the suppression of vibration and fluid forces provide some basic techniques to prevent failure or to extend the service life of cylindrical structures this study aims i to identify the behavior of vortex flow created by a free vibrating circular cylinder and to investigate some aspects like the vortex generation growth decay efflux angle etc and ii hence to search optimum positions of the control cylinder in order to suppress the flow induced vibration of a cylinder in addition the results obtained from a wind tunnel test are demonstrated through a visualization test in a water channel 2 experimental details the free vibration test was conducted in an open loop wind tunnel at kangwon national university korea the test section of the tunnel was 0 4 m in width 1 0 m in height and 1 2 m in length the supporting structure for the free vibration test was installed outside of the working section as illustrated in fig 1 the test cylinder was mounted on an aluminum frame structure the test cylinder used in the free vibration test was 66 mm in diameter d and had a 10 mm diameter aluminum shaft at the cylinder center three plastic disks two of them at the two ends and one at the midsection of the cylinder were fitted to support the shaft at the cylinder axis the shaft at the cylinder was extended to the outsides of the tunnel to anchor support assemblies as shown in fig 1 each support assembly consisted of two leaf springs each 0 3 mm thick phosphor bronze and two coil springs allowing the cylinder to vibrate in the vertical direction cross flow only the cylinders spanned the 0 4 m dimension of the tunnel the cylinder to be as light as possible was a paper tube wrapped by a vinyl film of 0 1 mm in thickness the tube had a wall thickness of 1 mm and a weight of 0 21 kg m the cylinder including the shaft disk etc had a mass m 0 267 kg yielding a mass ratio m m m f 226 5 where m f is the mass of the fluid displaced by the cylinder the resultant natural frequency f n of the cylinder system in still air was 11 1 hz the cylinder in still air was given an initial displacement and then released to vibrate due to structural damping the vibration amplitude dampens with time when the cylinder was about to stop it was again displaced and released this was done a few times simultaneously the cylinder vibration was recorded using a laser displacement meter of 40 mm range with a resolution of 10 μm the f n was determined from the fourier power spectrum of the vibration signal the structural damping ratio ζ 0 0033 estimated from the logarithmic decrement of the amplitude streamwise flow velocities u at a series of locations in the cylinder wake were measured using a hot wire probe as illustrated in figs 1 and 2 providing time mean and fluctuating velocity fields the hotwire signals were offset low pass filtered cut off frequency 1 0 khz amplified and the digitized using an a d board at a sampling frequency of 500 hz the sampling duration was 20 s for each record the velocity measurement positions denoted by dots in the wake of the cylinder are displayed in fig 2 the measurements were done at six streamwise distances x 0d 1d 2d 3d 4d and 5d measured from the rear stagnation point with lateral distances of y 2d 3d depending on x a propeller type velocity meter was used to measure freestream velocity u having a resolution of 0 01 m s in a range of 0 6 40 m s the reduced velocity u r u f n d was varied from 1 5 to 22 by changing u from 1 to 15 m s corresponding to re 4 365 65470 with the freestream turbulent intensity less than 0 55 to avoid the damage to the cylinder u r was not further increased when the vibration amplitude reached 0 25d given m ζ 0 75 measurement uncertainties in u r vibration amplitude f n and ζ were estimated to be 2 1 6 2 and 2 5 respectively furthermore to observe the flow structure around the vibrating cylinder a flow visualization test was performed in a water channel width depth length 0 3 0 4 2 0 m test section at kitami institute of technology japan the vibration was given using a forced vibration setup shown in fig 3 a pair of slide rails was placed on the water channel equipment and a transparent acryl plate was attached on it to enable one dimensional reciprocal movement the acryl plate was connected to the crank link shaft driven by the motor so that the rotation of the motor generates reciprocating motion of the acryl plate hence of the cylinder in the crossflow direction the same setup has also been subsequently used for two cylinders by alam and kim 2009 the cylinder model was of d 20 mm and length l 400 mm while a length of 250 mm was submerged in water the vibration frequency of the cylinder could be controlled by the number of rotation of the motor and the amplitude could be controlled by an adjustment of the sliding stage of the x axis to visualize the wake structure hydrogen bubble technique was deployed the hydrogen bubbles were generated from the water electrolyzed by the dc current transferred to the cathode connected to the tungsten wire installed in the upstream of the cylinder a camcorder was installed above the setup to record video images of the flow the visualization test involves both no vibration and vibration of the cylinder at re 700 to reproduce the free vibration in the water channel the oscillation frequency of the cylinder was adjusted to achieve the same u r corresponding to the wind tunnel test takai and sakamoto 2006 examined flow induced torsional responses of a rectangular prism in a wind tunnel and the flow structure was clarified using forced vibration test in a water channel morse and williamson 2009 made use of forced vibration experiments to predict free vibration response and wake modes obtained by govardhan and williamson 2000 they observed a close agreement between forced and free vibration results concluding that the forced vibration is reasonable to predict free vibration response carberry et al 2004 observed a strong similarity in the variation of wake mode force and phase for both forced and free vibrations 3 flow induced vibration and wake flow field of the cylinder 3 1 vibration response before conducting an extensive measurement of vibration control the flow induced vibration response and the wake of the test cylinder were examined fig 4 shows vibration amplitude ratio a d against u r where a is called harmonic amplitude motion calculated as the rms of the displacement signal multiplied by 2 the results from feng 1968 for almost the same m ζ is also included for a comparison purpose the maximum amplitude obtained by feng is somewhat higher than that obtained presently because of a smaller m ζ in feng 1968 overall the vibration responses measured presently agree well with those from feng 1968 given the slight difference in m ζ the vibration in the present measurements starts at u r 5 32 and stops at u r 7 5 with a maximum amplitude of 0 14 occurring at u r 5 73 therefore u r 5 32 7 5 can be defined as the vibration regime this response curve will be used as the baseline for vibration suppression in the next section for the detailed wake measurements three reduced velocities u r 4 03 before the vibration regime u r 5 73 corresponding to the maximum a d and u r 9 43 beyond the vibration regime were chosen 3 2 wake flow field fig 5 presents the time mean velocity distribution along the y direction in the wake of the test cylinder at different x for all three u r 4 03 5 73 and 9 43 considered the starting point of an arrow in fig 5 is the velocity measurement point and the length of the arrow is proportional to the flow velocity the flow velocities at all x and u r are given at the same scale for the sake of a better interpretation all velocity distributions fig 5 showed qualitatively similar behavior with the change in u r at their respective locations x 0d 1d 2d 3d 4d and 5d apparently the velocity distribution being symmetric about the wake centerline is largely affected at smaller x and approaches to that u without the cylinder when the measurement point moves far from the wake centerline y 0 as well as from the cylinder in fig 5 a c the points at which the velocity of the wake flow becomes u are marked with the trace of on each side of the wake is presented by a straight line which can be regarded as the outer edge of the wake the vortices generated from the cylinder thus propagate within a v shape region enclosed by the two straight lines the slope of these lines about the x axis is found to be 16 3 17 3 and 16 6 for u r 4 03 5 73 and 9 42 respectively 3 3 spectral analysis and wake structure the power spectrum of a fluctuating velocity provides the content of energy at different frequencies it is calculated using a fast fourier transform fft algorithm in a cylinder wake as the fluctuation of velocity largely stems from the vortex shedding the power spectrum of the velocity fluctuation thus features a peak at the shedding frequency the magnitude of the peak represents the energy at the shedding frequency fig 6 shows the distribution of energy at the vortex shedding frequency obtained from the power spectra of fluctuating velocities measured at different locations the thick horizontal lines scale the energy intensities at different measurement locations the energy varies with y at each x between 0d to 5d symmetrical about the wake centerline the energy distribution at a given x displays a peak maximum energy on each side of the wake centerline a red dashed line traces the peak energy points schaefer and eskinazi 1958 for a stationary cylinder showed that at a given x the velocity fluctuation increases with y and reaches a maximum before declining they confirmed that the position of maximum velocity fluctuation corresponds to the outer edge of the vortex core the red dashed line is thus can be regarded as the trajectory of the outer edges of the vortices the lateral separation between the two trajectories in the wake is almost constant for x 3d but augments for x 3d nevertheless there is a difference in the lateral separation between vibration and no vibration cases the lateral separation is smaller for the vibration case u r 5 73 interestingly for u r 4 03 and 9 42 both falling in no vibration regime the energy at a given y grows with an increase in x up to x 2d and declines for a further increase in x the vortices thus go through a process of generation x 0d growth x 0d 2d decay x 2d however for u r 5 73 the process comprising the generation growth and decay appears very close to the cylinder with the largest energy magnitude at x 0d the difference is attributed to the vibration generated at u r 5 73 the cylinder vibration results in the vortex shedding closer to the cylinder as will be shown later schaefer and eskinazi 1958 for a stationary cylinder at a low re 118 observed a declination in the lateral separation of the outer edges of vortices for x 2 5 and an increase for x 2 5 6 which is consistent with the present results except that the declination is not identified presently the difference might be due to the coarse resolution in y in the present experiment and or due to the difference in re between the present and their experiments it is found that the fluid dynamics at u r 4 03 and 9 42 bears similarity visualized flow structures in the same scale for u r 4 03 no vibration and 5 73 vibration are presented in fig 7 as seen in the figures karman vortex street is observed in the wake irrespective of the presence absence of the vibration while the lateral separation between the outer edges of the wake is found wider for u r 5 73 than for u r 4 03 the lateral separation between the two rows of vortices is smaller for u r 5 73 the observation is consistent with that of figs 5 and 6 4 suppression of flow induced vibration of the test cylinder by a control cylinder in the previous section it has been reported that the test cylinder vibrates at a large amplitude at u r 5 73 the amplitude being a d 0 14 an experiment was performed to suppress the flow induced vibration of the test cylinder in order to suppress the flow induced vibration another circular cylinder of 0 5d hereafter referred to as the control cylinder was placed in the wake of the test cylinder as shown in fig 8 the control cylinder position denoted by image 1 is varied as x 0d 0 2d 0 4d 0 6d 0 7d 0 8d 1 0d and 1 1d and y 0 1 7d with δy 0 1d thus a total of 136 control cylinder positions are considered for each control cylinder position the vibration response of the test cylinder is investigated the vibration responses of the test cylinder for the different positions of the control cylinder are shown in fig 9 each inset graph in fig 9 illustrates the variation in a d with u r the streamwise and lateral distances of the control cylinder from the rear stagnation point are shown on the x and y axis respectively while the response curve for y 0 0 9d is presented in fig 9 a and that for the rest y 1 0d 1 7d is in fig 9 b in the inset graphs the response of the test cylinder in the absence of the control cylinder dashed line is also shown in order to see how the controlled response solid line is different from the non controlled response dashed line as seen in the figure the vibration response is highly sensitive to the control cylinder position a scrupulous observation of the responses one by one facilitated a classification of the responses into four patterns namely i ii iii and iv each pattern having distinct characteristics zoom in views of representative patterns and occurrence regimes are shown in fig 10 pattern i is characterized by the occurrence of vibration at smaller u r compared with the non controlled counterpart figs 9 and 10 the maximum amplitude u r shifts toward the left this pattern appears for x 0d 1 1d and y 0 9 1 5 d 1 7d i e when the control cylinder is away from the wake centerline being nearly side by side the regime at which pattern i prevails is marked with image 2 in figs 9 and 10 pattern ii surrounded by image 3 appearing for x 0 6 1 0 d 1 1d and y 0d 0 9d features the vibration occurrence for a longer range of u r mostly extending toward the higher u r this pattern is found opposite to pattern i in the view of the amplitude peak shifting left or right compared to the non controlled counterpart the vibration response in patterns i and ii is self limited pattern iii enclosed by image 4 for x 0 4d 0 8d and y 0 0 3 d 0 4d is connected to the vibration amplitude escalating with an increase in u r resembling a galloping vibration since the initiation of the vibration in pattern iii takes place almost at the same u r as that for the non controlled case it can be stated that the vibration is initially generated due to the vortex excitation and then transmutes into a galloping vibration with a sufficient increase in u r pattern iv bordered with image 5 represents the absence of vibration in most of the regime or a very small 20 of non controlled case at x 0 5d y 0 6d 1 0d amplitude vibration this is the most interesting pattern or regime where vibration is suppressed based on the mechanism of the vibration suppression this regime can further be divided into two subregimes iv a x 0d 0 6d y 0 8d 1 4d and iv b x 0d 1 0d y 0 3 0 5d 0 7d see figs 9 and 10 the regimes of the four patterns can also be clarified from the contour plot of the maximum vibration amplitude due to the vortex excitation as shown in fig 11 interestingly the maximum amplitude also distinguishes the regimes of the vibration classifications while the vibration amplitude is large in the most of the regime of pattern ii it is suppressed in the entire regime of pattern iv an intermediate amplitude prevails in the regimes of patterns i and iii they are however different by the occurrence of galloping vibration in order to distinguish the galloping vibration regime the vibration amplitude at u r 11 is presented in fig 12 apparently galloping vibration occurs in pattern iii the amplitude at the same u r 11 is maximum at x 0 4d y 0 0 1 d decreasing with increasing y now we can connect the regime of pattern iv to the energy distribution in fig 6 b at x 0 the energy at the vortex shedding frequency was distributed over y 0 5 1 3 d fig 6 b the range of y matches with the lateral width of the pattern iv regime for free vibration of a cylinder at a small m ζ 0 05 vibration frequency f osc may vary with u r in the lock in or galloping regime f osc being different from f n e g assi 2014 the detuning between the f osc and f n has also been identified by mittal kumar 2001 for tandem cylinders at m ζ 0 00051 at a large m ζ 0 25 one can expect f osc f n 1 feng 1968 govardhan and williamson 2000 in the present experiment with m ζ 0 75 the value f osc f n registers around 1 when the cylinder vibrates the distribution of f osc f n as a function of u r is thus not presented 4 1 mechanism of vibration suppression the most interesting phenomenon the suppression of vibration pattern iv can be narrated here it is worth investigating the flow structures associated with the vibration suppression flow visualization test results for patterns iv a and iv b are shown in fig 13 interestingly for pattern iv a fig 13 a several features can be pointed out such as i a narrow wake behind the test cylinder and a wide wake behind the control cylinder ii the interaction of the gap flow with the freestream side shear layer of the test cylinder leading to impaired vortex shedding from the test cylinder iii the narrow wake merging with the wide wake where only the wide wake survives and iv hence finally the resultant wake lacking an alternating karman vortex street the suppression of vibration of the test cylinder thus results from the absence of definite karman vortex street in the wake the observation is consistent with the results obtained by kim and alam 2015 for two equal diameter cylinders in side by side arrangements they found no vibration for either cylinder at gap spacings of 0 2d 0 9d for this range of spacing the gap flow biased toward a side acts as a base bleed postpones interaction and rolling of the shear layers and hence weakens vortex sheddings vibration was thus not generated in either of the two cylinders on the other hand in pattern iv b the upper shear layer separating from the test cylinder reattaches on the control cylinder and swerves toward the other side shear layer of the test cylinder fig 13 b eventually a very wide wake persists behind the two combined cylinders the wake again lacks alternating karman vortices the physics behind the suppression in this pattern is that the control cylinder position is on the upper shear layer or vortex trajectory of the non control cylinder see fig 6 therefore the control cylinder distorts or disorganizes the upper shear layer of the test cylinder alam et al 2003 here the interaction between the shear layer and control cylinder succeeds in the suppression of the alternating karman vortices from the cylinders on the other hand in pattern iv a the interaction between the gap flow and freestream side shear layer leads to the suppression of alternating karman vortices bokaian and geoola 1984 observed galloping vibration of a flexible cylinder neighbored by another rigid cylinder of the same diameter with spacing x 0 59d 0 75d y 0 0 5d interestingly the regime iii to some extent agrees with ranges of x and y for identical cylinders given the diameters of the two cylinders are different presently the gap flow switch has been suggested as an excitation mechanism for a flexible cylinder placed behind another of identical diameter zdravkovich 1988 ruscheweyh and dielen 1992 dielen and ruscheweyh 1995 the flexible cylinder oscillation was not excited when it was inline with the upstream cylinder but excited only when it was with an initial displacement greater than 0 2d zdravkovich 1974 or with incoming flow incidence angle being larger than about 10 the oscillations generation was explained by the existence of two flow modes during the vibration one appearing for a longer time was with an intense flow through the gap generating a large inward lift force and the other prevailing for a shorter time was with no gap flow leading to very small or negligible lift force this hysteresis in the flow maintained the large amplitude oscillation it is believed that the gap flow switch is responsible for the galloping occurring in regime ii regime iv is identified as suppressed vibration regime while regime ii is the galloping vibration regime for a fixed cylinder it has been demonstrated that placing a control cylinder around a cylinder can suppress time mean drag and fluctuating forces e g igarashi and tsutsui 1989 strykowski and sreenivasan 1990 sakamoto et al 1991 the present research warns that if the cylinder elasticity is considered the force control technique might be useful for certain regimes but not for some other regimes 4 conclusions firstly the wake of a cylinder subjected to vortex excited vibration is investigated in terms of time mean velocity and energy intensity that was obtained through the power spectral analysis of fluctuating streamwise velocity secondly the effectiveness of a control cylinder placed at x 0d 1 1d and y 0d 1 7d is examined to suppress the flow induced vibration of the test cylinder for different positions of the control cylinder finally a forced vibration experiment in a water tunnel is conducted to visualize flow structures reproducing the free vibration results when a cylinder undergoes a vortex excited vibration the process of the generation growth disappearance of vortices appears closer to the cylinder compared to that for no vibration the efflux angle embraced the process of generation growth disappearance is within the range of 16 17 and appears to be constant regardless of the presence absence of vibration or changes in u r the vortex trajectory identified from the power spectral energy in the wake is substantiated by flow visualization test the lateral separation between the two vortex rows in a wake does not change for x 3d but widens for x 3d compared to that for a non vibrating cylinder the lateral separation for a vibrating cylinder undergoing vortex excitation is smaller a control cylinder placed in the wake of the test cylinder alters the vibration response of the test cylinder into four patterns namely i ii iii and iv depending on the control cylinder position the regimes of four patterns are also clarified by presenting contour plots of the maximum vibration amplitude due to the vortex excitation pattern i is characterized by the occurrence of vibration at a smaller u r compared to the non controlled counterpart unlike pattern i the pattern ii exemplifies the vibration occurrence for a longer range of u r mostly extending toward the higher u r pattern iii features the vibration amplitude increasing with an increase in u r resembling a galloping vibration on the

23609,this experimental study examines the wake flow and the flow induced vibration of an elastically supported circular cylinder referred to as test cylinder of diameter d and then the suppression of the flow induced vibration by a control cylinder of diameter 0 5d installed behind the circular test cylinder is investigated at reynolds number re 1 4 104 3 2 104 corresponding to the reduced velocity u r 0 4 22 the streamwise and lateral separations of the control cylinder from the test cylinder center are varied as 0 2d 1 1d and 0 1 7d respectively the vortex trail encompassing the vortex generation to the disappearance in the wake of the test cylinder is identified by means of wake energy distributions obtained from power spectra of fluctuating streamwise velocities based on the energy distributions the control cylinder positions are determined to suppress the flow induced vibration the process of vortex generation growth disappearance in the wake of a vibrating cylinder occurs closer to the cylinder compared to that of a non vibrating cylinder the lateral separation between the two rows of vortices for a vibrating cylinder is found to be smaller the controlled vibration responses of the cylinder are classified into four patterns i ii iii and iv depending on the control cylinder position patterns i and ii both self limited amplitude vibrations are characterized by the occurrence of vibrations at a smaller and a larger u r respectively compared to the non controlled counterpart pattern iii represents an increasing vibration amplitude with an increase in u r resembling a galloping vibration pattern iv features vibration suppression resulting from the suppression of the karman street in the wake this regime is divided into two subregimes iv a and iv b while the interaction between the gap flow and freestream side shear layer of the test cylinder succeeds in the suppression of the karman street in pattern iv a that between the gap shear layer and the control cylinder gives rise to the suppression of the karman street in pattern iv b keywords cross flow vibration vortex efflux angle circular cylinder suppression 1 introduction circular cylindrical structures are commonly seen in our daily lives such as risers bridge piers pipelines most of which stand against flowing fluids the alternate vortex shedding from the structures may produce a large fluctuating pressure on the structures causing structural vibrations acoustic noise and even resonance which can trigger structural failure numerous failures in the practical applications of cylindrical structures in cross flow are illustrated in chen 1987 paıdoussis 1993 and blevins 1990 the cost associated with a typical engineering structural failure can easily reach the order of one million dollars and even billions of dollars naturally there is a pressing need to study and to understand the fluid dynamics associated with multiple cylindrical structures in cross flow accordingly many studies have delved into the interaction between flowing fluid and structures flow induced vibrations of two identical diameter cylinders in tandem staggered and side by side arrangements are studied by kim et al 2009a alam and kim 2009 and kim and alam 2015 respectively where they found that flow induced vibration characteristics of the cylinders are highly contingent on the cylinder arrangement and spacing between the cylinders kim and alam 2015 for two side by side identical cylinders identified four vibration response patterns namely i the two cylinders vibrating at a large amplitude in the same range of u r at 0 1 t 0 2 ii no vibration generated for either cylinder at 0 2 t 0 9 iii the two cylinders vibrating at different ranges of u r at 0 9 t 2 1 and iv each cylinder response resembling an isolated cylinder response at 2 1 t 3 2 where t is the cylinder gap spacing ratio lam and to 2003 performed an experimental study where the downstream cylinder was flexible and half in diameter than the upstream cylinder no vibration was observed the cause of no vibration was attributed to the fact that the upstream cylinder of being larger diameter shelters the downstream cylinder tu et al 2014 numerically studied flow induced vibrations of an elastically mounted circular cylinder subjected to a planar shear flow with the single only cross flow direction and two degree of freedoms both in line and cross flow directions in the laminar flow re 150 the effects of shear rate k 0 0 0 1 reduced velocity u r 3 0 12 0 and natural frequency ratio r 1 0 2 0 on the characteristics of vortex induced vibration viv responses were studied chen et al 2013 investigated the viv of a circular cylinder under a suction flow reporting an optimal suction flow rate at which viv was completely suppressed the rotary oscillation control can be implemented to suppress the response amplitude of viv by locking the vortex shedding frequency at the forcing frequency using a traveling wave wall method xu et al 2014 focused on the suppression of the viv of an elastically supported circular cylinder with a two degree of freedom at a low re 200 to investigate the feasibility for the flow control around a cylinder strykowski and sreenivasan 1990 used a control cylinder of the diameter ranging from 0 05d to 0 33d and observed that a placement of a smaller cylinder in the near wake of the cylinder can alter the vortex shedding the temporal growth rate of disturbances was weakened and drag was reduced zhao et al 2007 performed a similar numerical investigation using a control cylinder of diameter 0 5d sakamoto et al 1991 examined the suppression of the fluid forces by adding a control cylinder in a shear layer of a square cylinder the reduction was however more for the fluctuating forces than for the time mean forces 95 for fluctuating lift 75 for fluctuating drag and only 30 for time mean drag wu et al 2012 conducted experiments with a focus on vibration suppression of a deepwater riser by using four control cylinders each of diameter of 0 25d the vibration was suppressed for certain configurations the mechanism of vibration suppression however remained unclear igarashi and terachi 2002 examined the wake of a flat plate adding a control cylinder of diameter 0 04 0 4 d and found a larger reduction in drag for a larger diameter control cylinder wu et al 2014 numerically investigated viv characteristics of a cylinder controlled by a hinged flat plate the addition of the hinged plate efficiently suppressed the viv of and force fluctuations on the cylinder an active control method for suppressing viv response of an elastically mounted cylinder by forcing rotary oscillation was presented by du and sun 2015 kim et al 2009b used tripwires to suppress viv and galloping vibrations of a single and two tandem cylinders tripping wire positions α measured from the leading stagnation line of the cylinder were changed from α 20 to 60 to determine the optimum range of α for suppressing structural vibrations the vibrations on both cylinders were completely suppressed for α 20 30 lu et al 2014 in a laminar flow investigated the effect of rod to cylinder spacing ratio rod and cylinder diameter ratio re and angle of attack on the main circular cylinder it was observed that the range of the spacing ratio where significant force suppression is achieved becomes narrower as the re increases in the laminar regime but was insensitive to the diameter ratio among the studies delving into the topics associated with circular cylinders the studies that examined the suppression of vibration and fluid forces provide some basic techniques to prevent failure or to extend the service life of cylindrical structures this study aims i to identify the behavior of vortex flow created by a free vibrating circular cylinder and to investigate some aspects like the vortex generation growth decay efflux angle etc and ii hence to search optimum positions of the control cylinder in order to suppress the flow induced vibration of a cylinder in addition the results obtained from a wind tunnel test are demonstrated through a visualization test in a water channel 2 experimental details the free vibration test was conducted in an open loop wind tunnel at kangwon national university korea the test section of the tunnel was 0 4 m in width 1 0 m in height and 1 2 m in length the supporting structure for the free vibration test was installed outside of the working section as illustrated in fig 1 the test cylinder was mounted on an aluminum frame structure the test cylinder used in the free vibration test was 66 mm in diameter d and had a 10 mm diameter aluminum shaft at the cylinder center three plastic disks two of them at the two ends and one at the midsection of the cylinder were fitted to support the shaft at the cylinder axis the shaft at the cylinder was extended to the outsides of the tunnel to anchor support assemblies as shown in fig 1 each support assembly consisted of two leaf springs each 0 3 mm thick phosphor bronze and two coil springs allowing the cylinder to vibrate in the vertical direction cross flow only the cylinders spanned the 0 4 m dimension of the tunnel the cylinder to be as light as possible was a paper tube wrapped by a vinyl film of 0 1 mm in thickness the tube had a wall thickness of 1 mm and a weight of 0 21 kg m the cylinder including the shaft disk etc had a mass m 0 267 kg yielding a mass ratio m m m f 226 5 where m f is the mass of the fluid displaced by the cylinder the resultant natural frequency f n of the cylinder system in still air was 11 1 hz the cylinder in still air was given an initial displacement and then released to vibrate due to structural damping the vibration amplitude dampens with time when the cylinder was about to stop it was again displaced and released this was done a few times simultaneously the cylinder vibration was recorded using a laser displacement meter of 40 mm range with a resolution of 10 μm the f n was determined from the fourier power spectrum of the vibration signal the structural damping ratio ζ 0 0033 estimated from the logarithmic decrement of the amplitude streamwise flow velocities u at a series of locations in the cylinder wake were measured using a hot wire probe as illustrated in figs 1 and 2 providing time mean and fluctuating velocity fields the hotwire signals were offset low pass filtered cut off frequency 1 0 khz amplified and the digitized using an a d board at a sampling frequency of 500 hz the sampling duration was 20 s for each record the velocity measurement positions denoted by dots in the wake of the cylinder are displayed in fig 2 the measurements were done at six streamwise distances x 0d 1d 2d 3d 4d and 5d measured from the rear stagnation point with lateral distances of y 2d 3d depending on x a propeller type velocity meter was used to measure freestream velocity u having a resolution of 0 01 m s in a range of 0 6 40 m s the reduced velocity u r u f n d was varied from 1 5 to 22 by changing u from 1 to 15 m s corresponding to re 4 365 65470 with the freestream turbulent intensity less than 0 55 to avoid the damage to the cylinder u r was not further increased when the vibration amplitude reached 0 25d given m ζ 0 75 measurement uncertainties in u r vibration amplitude f n and ζ were estimated to be 2 1 6 2 and 2 5 respectively furthermore to observe the flow structure around the vibrating cylinder a flow visualization test was performed in a water channel width depth length 0 3 0 4 2 0 m test section at kitami institute of technology japan the vibration was given using a forced vibration setup shown in fig 3 a pair of slide rails was placed on the water channel equipment and a transparent acryl plate was attached on it to enable one dimensional reciprocal movement the acryl plate was connected to the crank link shaft driven by the motor so that the rotation of the motor generates reciprocating motion of the acryl plate hence of the cylinder in the crossflow direction the same setup has also been subsequently used for two cylinders by alam and kim 2009 the cylinder model was of d 20 mm and length l 400 mm while a length of 250 mm was submerged in water the vibration frequency of the cylinder could be controlled by the number of rotation of the motor and the amplitude could be controlled by an adjustment of the sliding stage of the x axis to visualize the wake structure hydrogen bubble technique was deployed the hydrogen bubbles were generated from the water electrolyzed by the dc current transferred to the cathode connected to the tungsten wire installed in the upstream of the cylinder a camcorder was installed above the setup to record video images of the flow the visualization test involves both no vibration and vibration of the cylinder at re 700 to reproduce the free vibration in the water channel the oscillation frequency of the cylinder was adjusted to achieve the same u r corresponding to the wind tunnel test takai and sakamoto 2006 examined flow induced torsional responses of a rectangular prism in a wind tunnel and the flow structure was clarified using forced vibration test in a water channel morse and williamson 2009 made use of forced vibration experiments to predict free vibration response and wake modes obtained by govardhan and williamson 2000 they observed a close agreement between forced and free vibration results concluding that the forced vibration is reasonable to predict free vibration response carberry et al 2004 observed a strong similarity in the variation of wake mode force and phase for both forced and free vibrations 3 flow induced vibration and wake flow field of the cylinder 3 1 vibration response before conducting an extensive measurement of vibration control the flow induced vibration response and the wake of the test cylinder were examined fig 4 shows vibration amplitude ratio a d against u r where a is called harmonic amplitude motion calculated as the rms of the displacement signal multiplied by 2 the results from feng 1968 for almost the same m ζ is also included for a comparison purpose the maximum amplitude obtained by feng is somewhat higher than that obtained presently because of a smaller m ζ in feng 1968 overall the vibration responses measured presently agree well with those from feng 1968 given the slight difference in m ζ the vibration in the present measurements starts at u r 5 32 and stops at u r 7 5 with a maximum amplitude of 0 14 occurring at u r 5 73 therefore u r 5 32 7 5 can be defined as the vibration regime this response curve will be used as the baseline for vibration suppression in the next section for the detailed wake measurements three reduced velocities u r 4 03 before the vibration regime u r 5 73 corresponding to the maximum a d and u r 9 43 beyond the vibration regime were chosen 3 2 wake flow field fig 5 presents the time mean velocity distribution along the y direction in the wake of the test cylinder at different x for all three u r 4 03 5 73 and 9 43 considered the starting point of an arrow in fig 5 is the velocity measurement point and the length of the arrow is proportional to the flow velocity the flow velocities at all x and u r are given at the same scale for the sake of a better interpretation all velocity distributions fig 5 showed qualitatively similar behavior with the change in u r at their respective locations x 0d 1d 2d 3d 4d and 5d apparently the velocity distribution being symmetric about the wake centerline is largely affected at smaller x and approaches to that u without the cylinder when the measurement point moves far from the wake centerline y 0 as well as from the cylinder in fig 5 a c the points at which the velocity of the wake flow becomes u are marked with the trace of on each side of the wake is presented by a straight line which can be regarded as the outer edge of the wake the vortices generated from the cylinder thus propagate within a v shape region enclosed by the two straight lines the slope of these lines about the x axis is found to be 16 3 17 3 and 16 6 for u r 4 03 5 73 and 9 42 respectively 3 3 spectral analysis and wake structure the power spectrum of a fluctuating velocity provides the content of energy at different frequencies it is calculated using a fast fourier transform fft algorithm in a cylinder wake as the fluctuation of velocity largely stems from the vortex shedding the power spectrum of the velocity fluctuation thus features a peak at the shedding frequency the magnitude of the peak represents the energy at the shedding frequency fig 6 shows the distribution of energy at the vortex shedding frequency obtained from the power spectra of fluctuating velocities measured at different locations the thick horizontal lines scale the energy intensities at different measurement locations the energy varies with y at each x between 0d to 5d symmetrical about the wake centerline the energy distribution at a given x displays a peak maximum energy on each side of the wake centerline a red dashed line traces the peak energy points schaefer and eskinazi 1958 for a stationary cylinder showed that at a given x the velocity fluctuation increases with y and reaches a maximum before declining they confirmed that the position of maximum velocity fluctuation corresponds to the outer edge of the vortex core the red dashed line is thus can be regarded as the trajectory of the outer edges of the vortices the lateral separation between the two trajectories in the wake is almost constant for x 3d but augments for x 3d nevertheless there is a difference in the lateral separation between vibration and no vibration cases the lateral separation is smaller for the vibration case u r 5 73 interestingly for u r 4 03 and 9 42 both falling in no vibration regime the energy at a given y grows with an increase in x up to x 2d and declines for a further increase in x the vortices thus go through a process of generation x 0d growth x 0d 2d decay x 2d however for u r 5 73 the process comprising the generation growth and decay appears very close to the cylinder with the largest energy magnitude at x 0d the difference is attributed to the vibration generated at u r 5 73 the cylinder vibration results in the vortex shedding closer to the cylinder as will be shown later schaefer and eskinazi 1958 for a stationary cylinder at a low re 118 observed a declination in the lateral separation of the outer edges of vortices for x 2 5 and an increase for x 2 5 6 which is consistent with the present results except that the declination is not identified presently the difference might be due to the coarse resolution in y in the present experiment and or due to the difference in re between the present and their experiments it is found that the fluid dynamics at u r 4 03 and 9 42 bears similarity visualized flow structures in the same scale for u r 4 03 no vibration and 5 73 vibration are presented in fig 7 as seen in the figures karman vortex street is observed in the wake irrespective of the presence absence of the vibration while the lateral separation between the outer edges of the wake is found wider for u r 5 73 than for u r 4 03 the lateral separation between the two rows of vortices is smaller for u r 5 73 the observation is consistent with that of figs 5 and 6 4 suppression of flow induced vibration of the test cylinder by a control cylinder in the previous section it has been reported that the test cylinder vibrates at a large amplitude at u r 5 73 the amplitude being a d 0 14 an experiment was performed to suppress the flow induced vibration of the test cylinder in order to suppress the flow induced vibration another circular cylinder of 0 5d hereafter referred to as the control cylinder was placed in the wake of the test cylinder as shown in fig 8 the control cylinder position denoted by image 1 is varied as x 0d 0 2d 0 4d 0 6d 0 7d 0 8d 1 0d and 1 1d and y 0 1 7d with δy 0 1d thus a total of 136 control cylinder positions are considered for each control cylinder position the vibration response of the test cylinder is investigated the vibration responses of the test cylinder for the different positions of the control cylinder are shown in fig 9 each inset graph in fig 9 illustrates the variation in a d with u r the streamwise and lateral distances of the control cylinder from the rear stagnation point are shown on the x and y axis respectively while the response curve for y 0 0 9d is presented in fig 9 a and that for the rest y 1 0d 1 7d is in fig 9 b in the inset graphs the response of the test cylinder in the absence of the control cylinder dashed line is also shown in order to see how the controlled response solid line is different from the non controlled response dashed line as seen in the figure the vibration response is highly sensitive to the control cylinder position a scrupulous observation of the responses one by one facilitated a classification of the responses into four patterns namely i ii iii and iv each pattern having distinct characteristics zoom in views of representative patterns and occurrence regimes are shown in fig 10 pattern i is characterized by the occurrence of vibration at smaller u r compared with the non controlled counterpart figs 9 and 10 the maximum amplitude u r shifts toward the left this pattern appears for x 0d 1 1d and y 0 9 1 5 d 1 7d i e when the control cylinder is away from the wake centerline being nearly side by side the regime at which pattern i prevails is marked with image 2 in figs 9 and 10 pattern ii surrounded by image 3 appearing for x 0 6 1 0 d 1 1d and y 0d 0 9d features the vibration occurrence for a longer range of u r mostly extending toward the higher u r this pattern is found opposite to pattern i in the view of the amplitude peak shifting left or right compared to the non controlled counterpart the vibration response in patterns i and ii is self limited pattern iii enclosed by image 4 for x 0 4d 0 8d and y 0 0 3 d 0 4d is connected to the vibration amplitude escalating with an increase in u r resembling a galloping vibration since the initiation of the vibration in pattern iii takes place almost at the same u r as that for the non controlled case it can be stated that the vibration is initially generated due to the vortex excitation and then transmutes into a galloping vibration with a sufficient increase in u r pattern iv bordered with image 5 represents the absence of vibration in most of the regime or a very small 20 of non controlled case at x 0 5d y 0 6d 1 0d amplitude vibration this is the most interesting pattern or regime where vibration is suppressed based on the mechanism of the vibration suppression this regime can further be divided into two subregimes iv a x 0d 0 6d y 0 8d 1 4d and iv b x 0d 1 0d y 0 3 0 5d 0 7d see figs 9 and 10 the regimes of the four patterns can also be clarified from the contour plot of the maximum vibration amplitude due to the vortex excitation as shown in fig 11 interestingly the maximum amplitude also distinguishes the regimes of the vibration classifications while the vibration amplitude is large in the most of the regime of pattern ii it is suppressed in the entire regime of pattern iv an intermediate amplitude prevails in the regimes of patterns i and iii they are however different by the occurrence of galloping vibration in order to distinguish the galloping vibration regime the vibration amplitude at u r 11 is presented in fig 12 apparently galloping vibration occurs in pattern iii the amplitude at the same u r 11 is maximum at x 0 4d y 0 0 1 d decreasing with increasing y now we can connect the regime of pattern iv to the energy distribution in fig 6 b at x 0 the energy at the vortex shedding frequency was distributed over y 0 5 1 3 d fig 6 b the range of y matches with the lateral width of the pattern iv regime for free vibration of a cylinder at a small m ζ 0 05 vibration frequency f osc may vary with u r in the lock in or galloping regime f osc being different from f n e g assi 2014 the detuning between the f osc and f n has also been identified by mittal kumar 2001 for tandem cylinders at m ζ 0 00051 at a large m ζ 0 25 one can expect f osc f n 1 feng 1968 govardhan and williamson 2000 in the present experiment with m ζ 0 75 the value f osc f n registers around 1 when the cylinder vibrates the distribution of f osc f n as a function of u r is thus not presented 4 1 mechanism of vibration suppression the most interesting phenomenon the suppression of vibration pattern iv can be narrated here it is worth investigating the flow structures associated with the vibration suppression flow visualization test results for patterns iv a and iv b are shown in fig 13 interestingly for pattern iv a fig 13 a several features can be pointed out such as i a narrow wake behind the test cylinder and a wide wake behind the control cylinder ii the interaction of the gap flow with the freestream side shear layer of the test cylinder leading to impaired vortex shedding from the test cylinder iii the narrow wake merging with the wide wake where only the wide wake survives and iv hence finally the resultant wake lacking an alternating karman vortex street the suppression of vibration of the test cylinder thus results from the absence of definite karman vortex street in the wake the observation is consistent with the results obtained by kim and alam 2015 for two equal diameter cylinders in side by side arrangements they found no vibration for either cylinder at gap spacings of 0 2d 0 9d for this range of spacing the gap flow biased toward a side acts as a base bleed postpones interaction and rolling of the shear layers and hence weakens vortex sheddings vibration was thus not generated in either of the two cylinders on the other hand in pattern iv b the upper shear layer separating from the test cylinder reattaches on the control cylinder and swerves toward the other side shear layer of the test cylinder fig 13 b eventually a very wide wake persists behind the two combined cylinders the wake again lacks alternating karman vortices the physics behind the suppression in this pattern is that the control cylinder position is on the upper shear layer or vortex trajectory of the non control cylinder see fig 6 therefore the control cylinder distorts or disorganizes the upper shear layer of the test cylinder alam et al 2003 here the interaction between the shear layer and control cylinder succeeds in the suppression of the alternating karman vortices from the cylinders on the other hand in pattern iv a the interaction between the gap flow and freestream side shear layer leads to the suppression of alternating karman vortices bokaian and geoola 1984 observed galloping vibration of a flexible cylinder neighbored by another rigid cylinder of the same diameter with spacing x 0 59d 0 75d y 0 0 5d interestingly the regime iii to some extent agrees with ranges of x and y for identical cylinders given the diameters of the two cylinders are different presently the gap flow switch has been suggested as an excitation mechanism for a flexible cylinder placed behind another of identical diameter zdravkovich 1988 ruscheweyh and dielen 1992 dielen and ruscheweyh 1995 the flexible cylinder oscillation was not excited when it was inline with the upstream cylinder but excited only when it was with an initial displacement greater than 0 2d zdravkovich 1974 or with incoming flow incidence angle being larger than about 10 the oscillations generation was explained by the existence of two flow modes during the vibration one appearing for a longer time was with an intense flow through the gap generating a large inward lift force and the other prevailing for a shorter time was with no gap flow leading to very small or negligible lift force this hysteresis in the flow maintained the large amplitude oscillation it is believed that the gap flow switch is responsible for the galloping occurring in regime ii regime iv is identified as suppressed vibration regime while regime ii is the galloping vibration regime for a fixed cylinder it has been demonstrated that placing a control cylinder around a cylinder can suppress time mean drag and fluctuating forces e g igarashi and tsutsui 1989 strykowski and sreenivasan 1990 sakamoto et al 1991 the present research warns that if the cylinder elasticity is considered the force control technique might be useful for certain regimes but not for some other regimes 4 conclusions firstly the wake of a cylinder subjected to vortex excited vibration is investigated in terms of time mean velocity and energy intensity that was obtained through the power spectral analysis of fluctuating streamwise velocity secondly the effectiveness of a control cylinder placed at x 0d 1 1d and y 0d 1 7d is examined to suppress the flow induced vibration of the test cylinder for different positions of the control cylinder finally a forced vibration experiment in a water tunnel is conducted to visualize flow structures reproducing the free vibration results when a cylinder undergoes a vortex excited vibration the process of the generation growth disappearance of vortices appears closer to the cylinder compared to that for no vibration the efflux angle embraced the process of generation growth disappearance is within the range of 16 17 and appears to be constant regardless of the presence absence of vibration or changes in u r the vortex trajectory identified from the power spectral energy in the wake is substantiated by flow visualization test the lateral separation between the two vortex rows in a wake does not change for x 3d but widens for x 3d compared to that for a non vibrating cylinder the lateral separation for a vibrating cylinder undergoing vortex excitation is smaller a control cylinder placed in the wake of the test cylinder alters the vibration response of the test cylinder into four patterns namely i ii iii and iv depending on the control cylinder position the regimes of four patterns are also clarified by presenting contour plots of the maximum vibration amplitude due to the vortex excitation pattern i is characterized by the occurrence of vibration at a smaller u r compared to the non controlled counterpart unlike pattern i the pattern ii exemplifies the vibration occurrence for a longer range of u r mostly extending toward the higher u r pattern iii features the vibration amplitude increasing with an increase in u r resembling a galloping vibration on the other hand pattern iv represents the suppression of vibration the suppression of vibration results from the suppression of karman street in the wake based on how the karman street is suppressed this regime can further be divided into two subregimes iv a and iv b while the interaction between the gap flow and freestream side shear layer of the test cylinder succeeds in the suppression of the karman street in pattern iv a that between the gap shear layer and the control cylinder gives rise to the suppression of the karman street in pattern iv b acknowledgement kim wishes to acknowledge the
