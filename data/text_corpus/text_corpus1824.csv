9120,variable rate irrigation technology can reduce water use in centre pivot and lateral move irrigation systems through application of irrigation according to spatially varied soil water profiles however filling the profile may not maximise yield because of variations in crop response and water requirements with crop stage for example cotton crops produce optimal yield under slight water stress during early stages an irrigation strategy model predictive control has been implemented that accounts for changes in crop water requirements at different growth stages using biophysical crop models this strategy involves automatically and iteratively executing the biophysical crop model apsim parameterised with local soil and weather information with different irrigation depths to identify which combination maximises yield with the minimum depth of water application this strategy has potential to address spatial and temporal variations in crop water requirements but has not previously been evaluated for variable rate irrigation in the field this paper reports field trials conducted over four cotton gossypium hirsutum l seasons and two perennial ryegrass lolium perenne l seasons to evaluate the accuracy of the yield prediction of the biophysical model and compare field performance of irrigation strategies uniform irrigation and variable rate irrigation using a fixed underlying map soil water sensors and model predictive control yield was most accurately predicted using on site weather data and field soil core information with r² 0 733 and rmse 153 9 kg ha for cotton and r² 0 336 and rmse 295 3 kg ha for ryegrass for cotton model predictive control led to 4 9 more yield with 5 6 reduction in water application mainly through reduced water after peak bloom and or open boll physiological stages for grazed ryegrass the model predictive control strategy led to 8 5 more yield with 5 4 reduction in water application potentially caused by reduced applications after grazing events further work includes evaluating the model predictive control strategy with control of irrigation event timing under a broader range of field conditions to identify parameters to provide greatest economic return and to refine biophysical models for improved performance of optimisation in the strategy keywords autonomous variable rate irrigation optimisation image analysis apsim data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction irrigation is traditionally considered as uniform applications over entire fields however fields often have spatial variability in crop water requirements this can lead to overwatering in some areas of a field and under watering in other areas and reduced yield over the field variable rate irrigation vri hardware is commercially available and enables site specific application of irrigation by centre pivot and lateral move irrigation machines and costs 500 1500 ha au depending on manufacturer and configuration the commercial feasibility of vri depends on field variability crop type and potential water savings and yield improvements el chami et al 2019 sharma and irmak 2020 vri can achieve water savings of up to 25 while maintaining yield hedley and yule 2009 through irrigation according to spatially variable water holding capacities crop water use or crop types leaving capacity in the soil for capture of rainfall in soils with high water holding capacities and in regions with high in season rainfall and reducing or stopping irrigation in areas of fields that are uncropped or susceptible to overwatering or ponding e g inner spans of the machine areas in field prone to run off around water troughs laneways ditches peters and flury 2017 in dairy cattle pastures the reduced water in laneways would also reduce maintenance costs and cow lameness due to the drier laneways approaches have been developed to automate development of vri prescription maps aiming to match the spatial irrigation requirements over the field s cropped areas existing irrigation prescription map development processes available both commercially and those developed in research typically aim to fill the spatially variable soil water profile commercial prescription map development processes may be manual using software available with vri hardware e g valley365 fieldnet semi automated using yield elevation or electrical conductivity maps through precision agriculture software e g precision cropping technologies or automated using soil water balance approaches from satellite imagery e g prospera research tools that automate prescription map development are based on soil water sensors el naggar et al 2020 soil water balance models using etc from fao56 barker et al 2019 or biophysical models thorp et al 2017 crop water stress indices from canopy thermometers o shaughnessy et al 2020 vories et al 2020 or satellite imagery veysi et al 2017 irrigating to fill the soil profile may not maximise key grower targets i e yield or profit cammarano et al 2012 at the same time irrigating to fill the soil profile may not minimise environmental impacts e g reduce runoff and drainage gillies and smith 2015 nutrient leaching vogeler et al 2019 or greenhouse gas emissions li et al 2022a however optimising yield is a consideration to improve efficiency and positively impact the environment through production on less land thorp et al 2017 found that reducing early season irrigation led to increased yield possibly by encouraging cotton root growth and increasing capacity for water uptake and resilience to water shortage during reproductive development a yield driven strategy for irrigation management may provide yield improvements in addition to reported water savings automated irrigation strategies are reported that combine control systems with yield predictions from biophysical models to determine irrigation requirements that maximise yield for example a model predictive control mpc approach is reported that uses iterative execution of a biophysical model for cotton gossypium hirsutum l with different irrigation depths and timings to identify the irrigation management that maximises yield using the software variwise over a prediction horizon mccarthy et al 2010 2014 this strategy has potential to be automatically parameterised from online weather and soil data sources based on geo referenced information this would enable the strategy to be implemented autonomously in the background without the need for a skilled model operator the mpc strategy has potential to adapt irrigation application depths throughout the season to the temporal variations in crop water requirements caused by different crop growth stages simulation studies have reported little value in temporally adapting irrigation strategies for soybean crops kelly et al 2023 however there is potential for adaptive strategies to benefit other crops including cotton and grazed pasture for example cotton crops produce optimal yield under slight water stress during early stages while grazed crops may require lower irrigation depths initially after grazing events there is also potential to extend the strategies from cotton gossypium hirsutum l to grazed pasture in australia vri is most widely adopted in the pasture industry e g perennial ryegrass lolium perenne l for reducing irrigation in laneways and existing water bodies in the field implementation of mpc would require use of a biophysical model that enabled ryegrass simulation this may be achieved using the agricultural production systems simulator apsim holzworth et al 2014 which is modular in design and embeds models to simulate multiple crop types including cotton ozcot wells and hearn 1992 and pasture agpasture thornley johnson 2000 as implemented in sgs dairymod ecomod johnson 2008 the models predict final yield and daily values of crop height cover and fruiting or development parameters e g open boll counts dry matter no studies have been reported on the performance of yield driven model based strategies in the field the use of biophysical models for guiding management decisions requires that the model accurately reflect field conditions particularly yield for cotton and pasture growth for ryegrass the cotton model ozcot in apsim is generally reported to predict yield and fruiting parameters with strong correlations r² 0 7 0 9 yang et al 2014 shukr et al 2021 li et al 2022b similarly the pasture growth model agpasture integrated in apsim is reported to predict pasture growth with strong correlations r² 0 7 0 8 li et al 2011 however the models can have lower correlations if they do not adequately capture the complexity of the physiological or soil processes for example for newer cotton varieties not captured in biophysical models the fruiting development predicted by ozcot is reported to be delayed compared with field assessments richards et al 2001 yeates et al 2009 the model accuracy may also be reduced if row configurations are not standard milroy et al 2004 for example 1 m row spacing is most common in australian cotton but growers may use 1 5 m row spacing in seasons with limited water in addition low accuracies have been reported for the daily simulated soil water from agpasture model because the temporal dynamics simulated were not present in sensor measurements r² 0 1 for apsim harrison et al 2018 this suggested that apsim may be better suited for predicting parameters which have smaller fluctuations over time e g yield crop biophysical models require parameterisation to accurately reflect field conditions this includes soil properties drained upper limit lower limit saturated and starting soil water content bulk density daily weather data maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation and rainfall and crop variety features e g leaf area growth rate and fruit size development rate relative to day degrees the soil property drained upper limit is equivalent to the field capacity and crop lower limit is equivalent to the wilting point wigginton et al 2012 apsim uses these properties to calculate the plant available water capacity which is the maximum amount of water that can be stored in the soil profile and that is available to plants this can be a major cause of spatial yield variability he et al 2022 due to irrigation mis management apparent electrical conductivity from electromagnetic responses have been used to assess spatial variability and identify sampling locations for soil properties to parameterise apsim in addition apparent electrical conductivity has been used to assess the spatial variability in soil texture soil water and salt content e g vories et al 2020 rodríguez pérez et al 2011 hedley et al 2013 in fields with large variations in topography digital elevation models could be used to calculate topographic wetness indices and assess spatial variability priori et al 2013 therefore in a field trial electrical conductivity or elevation mapping could be conducted to identify sampling locations however some soil properties i e soil texture influential on crop development and productivity are not incorporated into apsim vogeler et al 2022 soil texture can influence crop development and yield for example due to rapid root penetration in soils with lighter soils with higher sand and silt content vories et al 2020 vories et al 2021 therefore the soil properties could be compared with strategy performance to identify their influence soil water holding and texture properties can be estimated from online soil databases e g apsoil in australia or assessed using infield soil sampling weather data from onsite weather stations are expected to be more accurate than regional weather information e g bureau of meteorology stations and silo simulations in australia particularly with significant spatial variations in rainfall over short distances in australia but can be expensive au 10 000 crop variety parameters for a range of varieties are often included with the models but can be calibrated if parameters for the planted variety are not available e g thorp et al 2017 a validation of model performance is required to ensure the weather and soil inputs are sufficient for model parameterisation to assess need for parameter calibration and to provide recommendations for field data requirements field trials are required to compare mpc with uniform irrigation and vri using fixed historical maps and soil water deficit to evaluate yield and efficiency differences field trials that compare vri strategies commonly involve small plot trials with at least two replicates of each strategy e g different deficit treatments across soil types e g hedley et al 2011 barker et al 2018 implementing vri trials require catch can data to ensure accurate applied irrigation depths plot based trials provide accurate performance comparison between strategies as the replicates are within the same paddock and soil type these can be assessed from yield irrigation applied and physiological indicators cotton physiological features that could be assessed include canopy cover and open boll counts potentially measured at broad spatial scales using uavs and image analysis algorithms existing image analysis algorithms involve segmentation to detect plant or open boll pixels based on colour thresholds where canopy cover is estimated from the ratio between green and all pixels kumar and miklavcic 2018 and open boll area is estimated from the ratio between white pixels and all pixels yeom et al 2018 ryegrass yield could be assessed using dry matter yield assessments for example a calibrated c dax rapid pasture meter agricultural solutions ltd palmerston north new zealand is commonly used to assess paddocks at a commercial scale and as an alternative pasture biomass ground truth to cuts and plate meters e g insua et al 2019 chen et al 2021 potential efficiency improvements have been identified for vri of cotton and grazed ryegrass pasture using mpc and biophysical modelling to meet temporal and spatial crop water requirements this has not previously been evaluated for grazed pasture or in field trials in this study the objectives were to a evaluate the ability of biophysical model apsim to accurately predict yield in vri cotton and grazed ryegrass pasture scenarios and b investigate the field performance of automated vri strategies for cotton and ryegrass that aim to maximise yield as well as improve irrigation water use compared with standard grower practices and strategies based on filling the soil water profile performance was based on crop development parameters yield and irrigation water use indices 2 materials and methods 2 1 irrigation control strategies four irrigation control strategies were selected for evaluation in the field the strategies were implemented on the days the grower was irrigating as detailed below uniform flat irrigation rate with no sprinkler flowrate alterations this represented a standard commercial practice to irrigate the field uniformly with the irrigation application depth set by the grower on the irrigation machine control panel vri from fixed map vri fixed fixed variable rate irrigation map with variability based on apparent electrical conductivity or elevation maps fig 1 this represented a standard vri practice where irrigation depths were scaled depending on underlying variability e g from apparent electrical conductivity or elevation map between 70 and 100 vri from soil water sw sensors vri sw apply irrigation depths to replenish the soil water profile these were calculated as the difference between the soil water content at field capacity and averaged soil water content over the three sensors the drained upper limit was measured from infield soil sampling vri from mpc maximising yield vri mpc the mpc strategy of mccarthy et al 2014 was implemented to maximise predicted final yield the model was parameterised from on site weather data soil properties and management information the mpc strategy was implemented in variwise to compare the predicted yield at multiple irrigation depths ranging from 0 mm i e no irrigation to the flat rate irrigation depth of the irrigation machine i e the irrigation depth configured during commercial operations yields were predicted with multiple irrigation depths at intervals of 5 mm in this range for example for an irrigation machine with flat rate irrigation depth of 15 mm with four irrigation depths were simulated 0 5 10 and 15 mm the irrigation depths implemented were those that produced the highest predicted yield lint yield for cotton and dry matter for perennial ryegrass if two irrigation depths produced the same predicted yield the lower irrigation depth was selected to be applied this trial focussed on comparing the performance of the irrigation strategies to determine spatial application depths rather than determining the timing of the irrigation events as the trials were conducted on commercial farms where the timing was controlled by the grower further trials may involve using the strategies to irrigate based on soil moisture environmental impacts rainfall forecast and estimated grazing dates for pasture variwise was updated from programmatic execution of the cotton model ozcot mccarthy et al 2010 to apsim version 7 10 build r4200 this involved developing software to generate an apsim simulation file containing the soil and management parameters calling the apsim executable and then reading the generated apsim output file 2 2 field site selection trial sites selected were a a seven span centre pivot irrigated cotton field with a deep epicalcareous self mulching black vertosol anon 2022 over four seasons near yargullen queensland australia and b a five span centre pivot irrigated perennial ryegrass pasture field with a deep red mesotrophic haplic ferrosol masters 2012 over two seasons near elliott tasmania australia table 1 some paddocks in the ryegrass site were on steep slopes that contained slump features or hummocky patterns due to vegetation clearance and subsequent mass movement moreton 1999 the seven span centre pivot used for four consecutive cotton seasons was towed between cotton fields each season at the cotton site a flat rate application depth of 15 mm was applied until early vegetative growth ceased and 30 mm depth was applied for the rest of the season while the ryegrass machine had a flat rate application depth of 15 mm the irrigation machine at the cotton site always irrigated in a clockwise direction while the irrigation machine at the perennial ryegrass site irrigated in both clockwise and anti clockwise directions as it was part circle the vri hardware on the cotton machine was valley vri is anon 2022 which enabled individual sprinkler control whilst the vri hardware on the ryegrass machine was valley vri zone control which enabled control of 30 zones along the machine agsense agsense 2017 was installed on both machines to enable remote control of the machines and upload of the vri maps in this trial the system was implemented to only reduce irrigation application depths such that the uniform irrigation strategy would apply the highest irrigation depth the accuracy of the angular position of the irrigation machine was verified by monitoring the application from test vri maps over landmarks in the field flags of the cotton site and laneways and fences for the ryegrass site and the angle was offset as required this was conducted for both directions of machine travel for the ryegrass site the irrigation machine uniformity and vri performance were verified in catch can trials for both irrigation machines this field process was used to identify uniformity in irrigation along the machine and ensure the vri hardware nozzles and speed control were accurately applying irrigation depths and these depths were consistent in each direction of machine travel for the ryegrass site at the cotton site grids of catch cans were installed at the centre of spans 2 7 with three rows of five catch cans along the machine at 1 5 m spacing following the methodology of o shaughnessy et al 2013 at the ryegrass site grids of catch cans were installed in span 5 with two rows of 20 catch cans at 1 7 m spacing parallel with the machine and two rows of 31 catch cans at 1 7 m spacing perpendicular with the machine fixed vri prescription maps were uploaded for the vri application for the cotton site the root mean square error rmse between prescribed and measured applied depths was 2 6 mm with an average applied irrigation depth of 28 0 mm whilst for the ryegrass site the rmse between prescribed and measured applied depths was 2 7 mm with an average applied depth of 12 3 mm this is consistent with the reported performance of vri systems e g rmse 3 0 mm mm o shaughnessy et al 2013 the variability in soil types was assessed in each field to select locations for replicates of treatments across the fields four in the cotton trials and five in the ryegrass trials the cotton fields were surveyed using a dualem 1s that records electromagnetic responses i e electrical conductivity to 50 cm and 150 cm depths fig 1 the average measured electrical conductivity differed for each cotton field potentially because of a difference in soil water content each time the survey was conducted the ryegrass field was surveyed using elevation mapping to determine a topographic wetness index where smaller indices indicated steeper slope and higher indices indicated areas with potential for runoff fig 1 plot locations in ryegrass trials were positioned between machine towers were contained within a paddock without laneways and were approximately homogeneous with minimal overland flow to ensure water infiltrated where it was applied soil cores were collected in the sampling locations with results in tables 2 and 3 for cotton and ryegrass respectively at the cotton site two replicates of samples were collected using a 35 mm diameter hydraulic soil sampling rig the cores were divided into 30 cm sections to a 90 cm depth at the ryegrass site three replicates of samples were collected using a steel ring with 72 5 mm internal diameter and 61 mm height which was hammered into the profile at each depth these samples were analysed to characterise parameters required for apsim bulk density drained upper limit lower limit saturated water content using predicted van genuchten soil water retention curve parameters with retc schaap et al 2001 a retention curve development software that quantifies the hydraulic functions of unsaturated soils simunek et al 2007 soil water characteristics from the online soil database apsoil www apsim info were also obtained for comparison the plant available water capacity was calculated for each sampling location table 2 as the difference between drained upper limit and crop lower limit wigginton et al 2012 soil texture was assessed using the hydrometer analysis method of gee and bauder 1986 the soil properties were compared with the underlying soil variability maps to ground truth the soil differences electrical conductivity and topogaphic wetness indices were extracted from the maps for the cotton and ryegrass sites respectively this involved averaging measurements within 15 m of each sampling location for comparison with soil properties at the same sampling location from table 2 for each cotton season the higher electrical conductivity corresponded with higher plant available water capacity silt and clay content and lower sand content and bulk density therefore the electrical conductivity map indicated variation in water holding capacity and soil texture from table 3 for the ryegrass site the higher topographic wetness index corresponded with higher plant available water capacity slump features and clay content and lower sand and silt content trial plots were assigned in each site and replicated with dimensions of size and spacing to ensure that the irrigation strategies were applied independently without overlap from adjacent management zones the plots were positioned to align with the vri management zones and areas irrigated with each strategy were at least 20 m wide and 30 m considering sprinkler throw distance if the management zones were larger than 20 m wide the plots were the width of the management zone higgins et al 2016 recommended a minimum management zone size of 23 m for the valley section control vri system used at their ryegrass site vri prescription maps were generated following the xml file format required for agsense and uploaded on days of irrigation the dates of irrigation events were determined by the onsite managers and growers the irrigation events were occasionally stopped before the whole field was irrigated because of rainfall this would have led to variations in irrigation applied depths between the replicates of the plots in the uniform irrigation plots for the cotton sites soil nitrate and ammonium nitrogen tests were conducted before the initial nitrogen application each season the grower applied approximately 250 n kg ha before planting and 60 n kg ha as a side dressing before flowering nitrogen would not have been a limiting factor for the irrigation sites as the average nitrogen requirement for cotton over a season to achieve high yields is about 250 n kg ha smith and welsh 2018 with 60 70 applied upfront and 30 40 applied as a side dressing prior to flowering baird 2022 2 3 data collection weather data was collected at each site and season to provide minimum and maximum daily temperature rainfall and solar radiation for apsim simulations automatic weather stations aws were installed at the sites environdata weathermaster 2000 at the cotton site and environdata weather maestro with middleton solar sensors at the ryegrass site weather data were obtained from the closest australian government s bureau of meteorology bom through ftp ftp bom gov au weather station oakey airport for cotton site and wynyard airport for ryegrass site interpolated regional weather station datasets from silo a queensland government database containing continuous daily climate data for australia since 1889 through https www longpaddock qld gov au silo were obtained for comparison with the onsite aws data table 4 provides a summary of the weather data from on site weather stations there were large variations in rainfall between the weather stations as expected which were caused by the large spatial variation in rainfall the solar radiation was lower from the silo station than the aws and bom which would lead to underestimation of the daily crop water use and yield the temperature was generally lower from the aws than bom at both cotton and ryegrass sites this may have been caused by the bom stations being located at airports which have differences in land use compared with the farm sites and enclosed conditions leading to microclimates johnston 2020 soil moisture was monitored at the centre of the vri sw plots using soil water sensors at the cotton sites ict international mp406 standing wave sensors which have an accuracy of 1 anon 2022 were installed at depths of 30 60 and 90 cm at the ryegrass site enviropro ep100gl 04 capacitance probes which have an accuracy of 2 enviropro 2022 were installed with sensors at 10 cm intervals to 40 cm the soil water measurement at each depth was logged every 15 minutes throughout the season the soil water sensor data was calibrated using the approach of pendergast and hare 2007 by i scaling the data such that the change in soil moisture matched the known irrigation depth applied and ii adjusting the soil water curve such that the maximum soil water content measured equalled the soil field capacity manual plant measurements were collected in the vri sw plots of the cotton site to assess the model accuracy these measurements were for the same five plants in the centre of each plot plant stand was assessed in each replicate after emergence and canopy width and square green boll and open boll counts were measured weekly yield was assessed in all plots at harvest from lint collected by hand from 1 m² in the centre of each plot the lint was weighed and a cotton turnout percentage was 40 from the same cultivar in previous commercial gin operations for the ryegrass sites grazing dates were required to record harvesting events in apsim grazing dates were manually recorded by observing pasture in images collected by oblique cameras in the vri sw and vri mpc plots of each replicate in the 2021 22 season the grazing events were verified using gps trackers on the cattle at the ryegrass site the plots were monitored weekly to compare in season crop growth patterns between irrigation strategies the centre of each ryegrass plot was assessed weekly using a c dax pasture meter pulled by a quadbike to measure the height of pasture swards and estimate dry matter yield the calibration provided by the onsite field staff to convert pasture height from the c dax to dry matter is shown in eq 1 this calibration was conducted with a rising plate meter at the site 1 dry matter kg ha past ure height cm 15 675 4 685 the centre of each cotton plot was monitored weekly using a dji phantom 4 uav to assess canopy cover and open bolls the uav mission was developed using litchi software top view images were captured approximately 3 m from the ground while the uav was hovering so there was no thrust or propeller wind on the crop canopy fig 2 image analysis algorithms were implemented to extract fractional canopy cover using plant segmentation kumar and miklavcic 2018 and open boll area that extracts ratio of white pixels to all pixels yeom et al 2018 the image analysis outputs for canopy cover and open boll area were compared with the measured canopy width and open boll counts respectively to verify accuracy for indicating in season crop growth fig 3 the open boll area analysis was focussed on the images collected at defoliation as these would be most correlated with the open boll counts there were very strong correlations between the measured canopy width and canopy cover detected by uav image analysis r² 0 897 and the measured open bolls and open boll area detected by uav image analysis r² 0 718 the lower coefficient of determination for open boll area was expected as not all open bolls were visible from the top view of the plant 2 4 model and irrigation performance evaluation the accuracy of apsim with weather and soil data from different sources was evaluated to confirm whether on or off field data sources were required in apsim the weather source was programmatically updated by referring the apsim model to a text file containing the weather data from the specified source while the soil data source was programmatically updated in the apsim xml file used to run the model no other parameters were varied for this evaluation potential weather sources compared include regional weather stations bom and silo and the on site automatic weather station aws potential soil data sources include infield core samples and soil water characteristics obtained from online database apsoil apsim outputs from parameterised simulations were compared with field measurements using coefficients of determination r² and root mean square error rmse cotton field measurements compared include square counts green and open boll counts per m² canopy cover soil moisture mm and lint yield kg ha whilst ryegrass field measurements compared include height mm dry matter kg dm ha and soil moisture mm for both crops soil moisture measurements were obtained from the infield sensors for cotton canopy cover was obtained from the daily infield camera images and square and boll counts and lint yield were obtained from manual measurements whilst for ryegrass height and dry matter were obtained from weekly fortnightly c dax sensor data the irrigation strategies were implemented for each whole ryegrass season and from approximately 40 days after sowing for each cotton season the irrigation strategies were evaluated from measured end of season yield total irrigation applied irrigation water use index iwui gross production water use index gpwui and weekly crop growth features yield was interpreted as lint yield for cotton and dry matter yield for ryegrass irrigation applied was calculated from applied irrigation depths in the vri maps iwui was calculated as the ratio between yield and total irrigation applied gpwui was calculated as the ratio between yield and total water used by the crop which was the sum of the soil moisture change effective irrigation applied and effective rainfall the soil moisture change was the difference between the start and end simulated soil moisture over the season effective irrigation applied was calculated assuming 90 efficiency in the irrigation application smith et al 2014 multiple approaches are reported for calculating effective rainfall e g ali and mubarak 2017 for this application effective rainfall was calculated from the rainfall recorded by the onsite automatic weather station where for ryegrass the first 2 mm and over 25 mm were ineffective and for cotton the first 3 mm was ineffective and only 70 of the remaining rainfall was effective the percentage differences in irrigation applied yield and iwui were compared with the uniform and vri fixed irrigation strategies variations over fields were evaluated using standard deviations ryegrass yield was assessed from the average daily dry matter growth and dry matter yield the average daily dry matter growth was calculated from a weighted average of positive changes in biomass between c dax samples the dry matter yield was calculated by multiplying the average daily dry matter growth with the number of days between the first and last c dax samples in the irrigation season 155 days in 2020 21 and 133 days in 2021 22 the weekly crop growth was assessed using the uav for cotton and c dax for ryegrass to compare with changes in irrigation depths applied the differences for each strategy in irrigation application depths yield iwui and growth parameters were also compared with the plant available water capacity soil texture and or elevation parameters for ryegrass to identify impacts from soil or slope properties on the performance in each field and season 3 results and discussion 3 1 prediction accuracy table 5 presents the accuracy of apsim for cotton simulation using weather and soil data from different sources apsim most accurately predicted lint yield using weather data from on site aws and soil data from infield soil cores with r² 0 733 and rmse 153 9 kg ha using infield cores and r² 0 749 and rmse 191 9 kg ha using apsoil weather data source had a greater influence on simulation accuracy of lint yield than soil data source with input from bom being slightly more accurate than from silo from table 3 the largest difference in weather parameters between weather data sources was for rainfall which may have caused this variation in simulation performance apsim most accurately predicted lint yield and canopy cover and least accurately predicted soil water content and fruiting parameters across weather and soil data inputs the low accuracies in soil water content may have been caused by the model not accurately reflecting the differences in water use or evaporation due to the row configuration being 1 5 m rather than 1 m which is generally used for australian cotton in addition soil water was measured daily and the model may have been unable to accurately reflect daily fluctuations as measured the lower prediction accuracies for square and boll counts may have been caused the delay in the apsim simulated fruit development compared with the field measurements as reported in the literature the soil texture information not being incorporated into apsim may have contributed to inaccurate rate of soil water extraction which led to differences in fruit development however apsim may have represented soil texture information through the soil water related parameters table 6 presents the accuracy of apsim for grazed ryegrass pasture simulation using weather and soil data from different sources to evaluate the most suitable data source for parameterisation apsim was most accurate using aws or bom weather data and soil core information with accuracy of dry matter being r² 0 336 0 355 and rmse 295 3 331 1 kg ha using infield cores and r² 0 353 0 364 and rmse 301 1 336 4 kg ha using apsoil for ryegrass soil data source had a greater influence on simulation accuracy than weather data source with similar performance across the different weather stations this contrasts with cotton simulations where weather data source was more influential than soil data source this may be caused by less variation in weather measurements particularly solar radiation between weather stations for the ryegrass site compared with the cotton site apsim could more accurately simulate height and dry matter than soil moisture apsim most accurately predicted dry matter and height and least accurately predicted soil water content across weather and soil data inputs as for the cotton simulations the low accuracies in predicted soil water content may have been caused by the highly fluctuating nature of soil water data over short time spans that is not well represented in the model overall the coefficients of determination were lower for ryegrass simulations overall highest r² 0 366 compared with cotton simulations this may be caused by slight variations in accuracy around grazing events 3 2 irrigation strategy performance cotton table 7 and fig 4 compare the performance of the uniform irrigation and vri strategies in field trials for cotton whilst fig 5 compares the irrigation applied by each strategy during the 2018 19 season the irrigation machine had insufficient system capacity to deliver the crop s water requirements because of high temperatures and low rainfall this led to the uniform irrigation strategy producing the highest yield in 2018 19 during the 2021 22 season the crop yield was significantly lower because of two flood events and cooler temperatures leading to similar performance across all strategies from table 7 during the 2019 20 and 2020 21 cotton growing seasons the highest iwui and gpwui and lowest irrigation applied were achieved using the vri mpc approach followed by vri sw vri fixed and uniform irrigation from fig 4 over all seasons compared with vri fixed vri mpc produced 4 9 more yield with 5 6 less water vri sw produced 5 5 more yield with the same water and uniform irrigation produced 4 7 more yield with 7 2 more water over 2019 20 and 2020 21 compared with vri fixed vri mpc produced 0 5 more yield with 8 5 less water vri sw produced 0 5 less yield with 1 7 more water and uniform irrigation produced 2 2 less cotton yield with 5 3 more water there was no statistical difference in irrigation or yield between the strategies from fig 4 over all cotton growing seasons compared with uniform irrigation vri mpc produced 0 3 more yield with 11 7 less water vri sw produced 0 9 more yield with 6 1 less water and vri fixed produced 2 7 less yield with 6 4 less water over 2019 20 and 2020 21 compared with uniform irrigation vri mpc produced 2 8 more yield with 13 0 less water vri sw produced 1 8 more yield with 3 3 less water and vri fixed produced 2 6 more yield with 4 9 less water the difference in irrigation application between the uniform and the vri fixed plots was significant at the 0 05 level overall the strategies had a larger impact on irrigation applied rather than cotton yield this suggests that with the water available weather and management used from the trial site the approximate maximum yield was achieved with all strategies however the vri mpc strategy reduced the irrigation applied to obtain this yield this also indicates that the model optimisation used in vri mpc strategy can identify irrigation water savings without impacting yield there is potential for different strategies to be applied depending on the market value of cotton and water there is also potential for a similar model based irrigation strategy to include consideration of environmental impacts from fig 5 in all seasons similar irrigation depths were applied by all strategies until flowering in the 2020 21 and 2021 22 seasons irrigation applications were reduced after 80 100 days after sowing which was after peak bloom water stress during peak bloom to open bolls can cause young boll shedding but has less impact on yield than loss of early season bolls in the 2018 19 and 2019 20 seasons the vri mpc strategy also reduced irrigation applications at approximately 120 days after sowing which coincided with boll opening less water applied during peak boll opening may hasten boll opening improving defoliation and reducing regrowth leading to increased yield and fibre quality from table 7 the maximum cotton canopy cover and open boll area were similar across all strategies there was less variation in the date of maximum boll area than maximum canopy cover the vri fixed strategy produced the highest maximum canopy cover which occurred slightly later than the other strategies the vri sw strategy produced the highest maximum open boll area which occurred slightly later than the other irrigation strategies figs 6 and 7 compare the irrigation cotton lint yield and maximum canopy cover and open boll area in each plot and strategy with the plant available water content and silt content respectively these show the yield and maximum canopy cover and open boll area being positively correlated with the plant available water capacity and silt content this is because silty soils hold the most available water to plants and soils with higher capacity store water and enable extraction of water better by crops during dry growing seasons no strong correlations were observed between irrigation yield or cotton development and bulk density sand or clay content the performance of mpc may have been limited by the accuracy of apsim in particular the delay in the simulated physiological responses may have led to the irrigation strategy inaccurately assessing growth stage and corresponding irrigation requirement in addition apsim did not consider soil texture which was found to be highly influential on yield there is potential for improvements in the performance of model based management decisions with further development of the crop and soil prediction components in apsim the benefit of mpc may be larger in fields with more variation in soil properties which could be verified in further trials there is potential for further work to identify guidelines for field selection with sufficient variability to implement the system 3 3 irrigation strategy performance ryegrass table 8 and fig 8 compare the performance of the uniform irrigation and vri strategies in field trials for ryegrass while fig 9 compares the irrigation applied by each strategy from table 8 the highest iwui and gpwui for ryegrass and lowest irrigation applied were achieved using the vri mpc approach followed by vri sw vri fixed and uniform irrigation from fig 8 compared with vri fixed vri mpc produced 8 5 more dry matter yield with 5 4 less water vri sw produced 7 4 less dry matter yield with 2 9 more water and uniform irrigation produced 6 2 more yield with 14 4 more water the vri mpc strategy resulted in the highest water use efficiency whilst the uniform irrigation strategy applied the most water compared with uniform irrigation vri mpc produced 9 0 more dry matter yield with 16 9 less water vri sw produced 9 2 less dry matter yield with 9 9 less water and vri fixed produced 4 5 more dry matter yield with 12 4 less water all vri strategies increased yield and applied less water than the uniform strategy and vri mpc and vri sw strategies produced the largest yield improvements there was no statistical difference in irrigation or yield between the strategies the difference in irrigation application between the uniform and the vri fixed plots was significant at the 0 05 level from fig 9 the uniform strategy applied more water across all pasture growth stages the vri strategies applied lower irrigation depths from up to 5 days after grazing after which the vri mpc strategy applied slightly less water compared with the other vri strategies it is expected the water savings using vri mpc occurred because water applications were reduced to coincide with the lower ryegrass water requirement after grazing this reduced irrigation application while still meeting the pasture s needs may have led to less water saturation resulting in improved growth it is also noted that the vri mpc could meet the crop s water needs despite the lower accuracies of apsim simulations of ryegrass yield compared with cotton lint yield this indicates that the model could extract relative rather than absolute yield responses to different volume water there were larger variations in responses between plots in the ryegrass than cotton trials at the same time the pasture grown slightly increased with higher topographic wetness indices and slump features potentially because in these locations the pasture was more protected which led to improved pasture cover the pasture grown slightly decreased with higher sand and silt content potentially because of the reduced water holding capacity of these soils which may have impacted the crop during dry periods of the season however thess trend were only slight because of low spatial variation in plant available water capacity between replicates this suggests that the variations between plots were due to pasture compositions between paddocks e g dock clumps and or slump features rather than water capacity from table 8 the highest dry matter yield was achieved using the vri mpc strategy followed by vri sw uniform irrigation and vri fixed the uniform irrigation strategy had the highest average daily pasture growth rate possibly caused by rapid growth after grazing from the higher irrigation depths but then a reduction in growth caused by overwatering in later stages leading to reduced harvested herbage the reported trial focussed on using the vri techniques to adjust irrigation volumes on days of irrigation events at the commercial sites there is potential for further productivity improvements if the strategies were applied to determine when to start irrigating potentially based on soil moisture status forecast rainfall and grazing events for pasture in addition the vri mpc strategy could be adapted to economic and environmental impact optimisation by linking with water production costs run off or leaching parameters the performance of mpc may have been limited by the accuracy of apsim for predicting daily soil dynamics over short time spans this may have influenced the ryegrass simulations more than the cotton simulations because of the shorter seasons this is because the grazed pasture had a harvest event at each grazing which was optimised whilst the cotton had only one harvest event and target for optimisation in a commercial field implementation the system may be limited by the need for daily grazing information this would require either cattle trackers infield pasture sensors or manual data input which are not standard in current systems 4 conclusions field trials have been conducted over four cotton seasons and two perennial ryegrass seasons to evaluate the accuracy of the yield prediction of a biophysical model and compare field performance of uniform and variable rate irrigation strategies the predicted yield from the biophysical crop model was most accurate using on site weather data and soil core information with r² 0 733 and rmse 153 9 kg ha for cotton and rmse 127 4 kg ha for ryegrass for all season from the cotton field trials variable rate irrigation strategies had a larger impact on irrigation applied rather than yield with model predictive control led to 4 9 more yield with 5 6 reduced water application compared with standard vri water savings occurred through reduced water after peak bloom and or open boll physiological stages for grazed ryegrass the model predictive control strategy led to 8 5 more yield with 5 4 reduced water application compared with standard vri potentially caused by reduced application after grazing events the performance of all strategies was affected by plant available water capacity for cotton and slope for ryegrass there is potential for the strategy performance to improve with more accurate models for new varieties soil texture and

9120,variable rate irrigation technology can reduce water use in centre pivot and lateral move irrigation systems through application of irrigation according to spatially varied soil water profiles however filling the profile may not maximise yield because of variations in crop response and water requirements with crop stage for example cotton crops produce optimal yield under slight water stress during early stages an irrigation strategy model predictive control has been implemented that accounts for changes in crop water requirements at different growth stages using biophysical crop models this strategy involves automatically and iteratively executing the biophysical crop model apsim parameterised with local soil and weather information with different irrigation depths to identify which combination maximises yield with the minimum depth of water application this strategy has potential to address spatial and temporal variations in crop water requirements but has not previously been evaluated for variable rate irrigation in the field this paper reports field trials conducted over four cotton gossypium hirsutum l seasons and two perennial ryegrass lolium perenne l seasons to evaluate the accuracy of the yield prediction of the biophysical model and compare field performance of irrigation strategies uniform irrigation and variable rate irrigation using a fixed underlying map soil water sensors and model predictive control yield was most accurately predicted using on site weather data and field soil core information with r² 0 733 and rmse 153 9 kg ha for cotton and r² 0 336 and rmse 295 3 kg ha for ryegrass for cotton model predictive control led to 4 9 more yield with 5 6 reduction in water application mainly through reduced water after peak bloom and or open boll physiological stages for grazed ryegrass the model predictive control strategy led to 8 5 more yield with 5 4 reduction in water application potentially caused by reduced applications after grazing events further work includes evaluating the model predictive control strategy with control of irrigation event timing under a broader range of field conditions to identify parameters to provide greatest economic return and to refine biophysical models for improved performance of optimisation in the strategy keywords autonomous variable rate irrigation optimisation image analysis apsim data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction irrigation is traditionally considered as uniform applications over entire fields however fields often have spatial variability in crop water requirements this can lead to overwatering in some areas of a field and under watering in other areas and reduced yield over the field variable rate irrigation vri hardware is commercially available and enables site specific application of irrigation by centre pivot and lateral move irrigation machines and costs 500 1500 ha au depending on manufacturer and configuration the commercial feasibility of vri depends on field variability crop type and potential water savings and yield improvements el chami et al 2019 sharma and irmak 2020 vri can achieve water savings of up to 25 while maintaining yield hedley and yule 2009 through irrigation according to spatially variable water holding capacities crop water use or crop types leaving capacity in the soil for capture of rainfall in soils with high water holding capacities and in regions with high in season rainfall and reducing or stopping irrigation in areas of fields that are uncropped or susceptible to overwatering or ponding e g inner spans of the machine areas in field prone to run off around water troughs laneways ditches peters and flury 2017 in dairy cattle pastures the reduced water in laneways would also reduce maintenance costs and cow lameness due to the drier laneways approaches have been developed to automate development of vri prescription maps aiming to match the spatial irrigation requirements over the field s cropped areas existing irrigation prescription map development processes available both commercially and those developed in

irrigating to fill the soil profile may not maximise key grower targets i e yield or profit cammarano et al 2012 at the same time irrigating to fill the soil profile may not minimise environmental impacts e g reduce runoff and drainage gillies and smith 2015 nutrient leaching vogeler et al 2019 or greenhouse gas emissions li et al 2022a however optimising yield is a consideration to improve efficiency and positively impact the environment through production on less land thorp et al 2017 found that reducing early season irrigation led to increased yield possibly by encouraging cotton root growth and increasing capacity for water uptake and resilience to water shortage during reproductive development a yield driven strategy for irrigation management may provide yield improvements in addition to reported water savings automated irrigation strategies are reported that combine control systems with yield predictions from biophysical models to determine irrigation requirements that maximise yield for example a model predictive control mpc approach is reported that uses iterative execution of a biophysical model for cotton gossypium hirsutum l with different irrigation depths and timings to identify the irrigation management that maximises yield using the software variwise over a prediction horizon mccarthy et al 2010 2014 this strategy has potential to be automatically parameterised from online weather and soil data sources based on geo referenced information this would enable the strategy to be implemented autonomously in the background without the need for a skilled model operator the mpc strategy has potential to adapt irrigation application depths throughout the season to the temporal variations in crop water requirements caused by different crop growth stages simulation studies have reported little value in temporally adapting irrigation strategies for soybean crops kelly et al 2023 however there is potential for adaptive strategies to benefit other crops including cotton and grazed pasture for example cotton crops produce optimal yield under slight water stress during early stages while grazed crops may require lower irrigation depths initially after grazing events there is also potential to extend the strategies from cotton gossypium hirsutum l to grazed pasture in australia vri is most widely adopted in the pasture industry e g perennial ryegrass lolium perenne l for reducing irrigation in laneways and existing water bodies in the field implementation of mpc would require use of a biophysical model that enabled ryegrass simulation this may be achieved using the agricultural production systems simulator apsim holzworth et al 2014 which is modular in design and embeds models to simulate multiple crop types including cotton ozcot wells and hearn 1992 and pasture agpasture thornley johnson 2000 as implemented in sgs dairymod ecomod johnson 2008 the models predict final yield and daily values of crop height cover and fruiting or development parameters e g open boll counts dry matter no studies have been reported on the performance of yield driven model based strategies in the field the use of biophysical models for guiding management decisions requires that the model accurately reflect field conditions particularly yield for cotton and pasture growth for ryegrass the cotton model ozcot in apsim is generally reported to predict yield and fruiting parameters with strong correlations r² 0 7 0 9 yang et al 2014 shukr et al 2021 li et al 2022b similarly the pasture growth model agpasture integrated in apsim is reported to predict pasture growth with strong correlations r² 0 7 0 8 li et al 2011 however the models can have lower correlations if they do not adequately capture the complexity of the physiological or soil processes for example for newer cotton varieties not captured in biophysical models the fruiting development predicted by ozcot is reported to be delayed compared with field assessments richards et al 2001 yeates et al 2009 the model accuracy may also be reduced if row configurations are not standard milroy et al 2004 for example 1 m row spacing is most common in australian cotton but growers may use 1 5 m row spacing in seasons with limited water in addition low accuracies have been reported for the daily simulated soil water from agpasture model because the temporal dynamics simulated were not present in sensor measurements r² 0 1 for apsim harrison et al 2018 this suggested that apsim may be better suited for predicting parameters which have smaller fluctuations over time e g yield crop biophysical models require parameterisation to accurately reflect field conditions this includes soil properties drained upper limit lower limit saturated and starting soil water content bulk density daily weather data maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation and rainfall and crop variety features e g leaf area growth rate and fruit size development rate relative to day degrees the soil property drained upper limit is equivalent to the field capacity and crop lower limit is equivalent to the wilting point wigginton et al 2012 apsim uses these properties to calculate the plant available water capacity which is the maximum amount of water that can be stored in the soil profile and that is available to plants this can be a major cause of spatial yield variability he et al 2022 due to irrigation mis management apparent electrical conductivity from electromagnetic responses have been used to assess spatial variability and identify sampling locations for soil properties to parameterise apsim in addition apparent electrical conductivity has been used to assess the spatial variability in soil texture soil water and salt content e g vories et al 2020 rodríguez pérez et al 2011 hedley et al 2013 in fields with large variations in topography digital elevation models could be used to calculate topographic wetness indices and assess spatial variability priori et al 2013 therefore in a field trial electrical conductivity or elevation mapping could be conducted to identify sampling locations however some soil properties i e soil texture influential on crop development and productivity are not incorporated into apsim vogeler et al 2022 soil texture can influence crop development and yield for example due to rapid root penetration in soils with lighter soils with higher sand and silt content vories et al 2020 vories et al 2021 therefore the soil properties could be compared with strategy performance to identify their influence soil water holding and texture properties can be estimated from online soil databases e g apsoil in australia or assessed using infield soil sampling weather data from onsite weather stations are expected to be more accurate than

be expensive au 10 000 crop variety parameters for a range of varieties are often included with the models but can be calibrated if parameters for the planted variety are not available e g thorp et al 2017 a validation of model performance is required to ensure the weather and soil inputs are sufficient for model parameterisation to assess need for parameter calibration and to provide recommendations for field data requirements field trials are required to compare mpc with uniform irrigation and vri using fixed historical maps and soil water deficit to evaluate yield and efficiency differences field trials that compare vri strategies commonly involve small plot trials with at least two replicates of each strategy e g different deficit treatments across soil types e g hedley et al 2011 barker et al 2018 implementing vri trials require catch can data to ensure accurate applied irrigation depths plot based trials provide accurate performance comparison between strategies as the replicates are within the same paddock and soil type these can be assessed from yield irrigation applied and physiological indicators cotton physiological features that could be assessed include canopy cover and open boll counts potentially measured at broad spatial scales using uavs and image analysis algorithms existing image analysis algorithms involve segmentation to detect plant or open boll pixels based on colour thresholds where canopy cover is estimated from the ratio between green and all pixels kumar and miklavcic 2018 and open boll area is estimated from the ratio between white pixels and all pixels yeom et al 2018 ryegrass yield could be assessed using dry matter yield assessments for example a calibrated c dax rapid pasture meter agricultural solutions ltd palmerston north new zealand is commonly used to assess paddocks at a commercial scale and as an alternative pasture biomass ground truth to cuts and plate meters e g insua et al 2019 chen et al 2021 potential efficiency improvements have been identified for vri of cotton and grazed ryegrass pasture using mpc and biophysical modelling to meet temporal and spatial crop water requirements this has not previously been evaluated for grazed pasture or in field trials in this study the objectives were to a evaluate the ability of biophysical model apsim to accurately predict yield in vri cotton and grazed ryegrass pasture scenarios and b investigate the field performance of automated vri strategies for cotton and ryegrass that aim to maximise yield as well as improve irrigation water use compared with standard grower practices and strategies based on filling the soil water profile performance was based on crop development parameters yield and irrigation water use indices 2 materials and methods 2 1 irrigation control strategies four irrigation control strategies were selected for evaluation in the field the strategies were implemented on the days the grower was irrigating as detailed below uniform flat irrigation rate with no sprinkler flowrate alterations this represented a standard commercial practice to irrigate the field uniformly with the irrigation application depth set by the grower on the irrigation machine control panel vri from fixed map vri fixed fixed variable rate irrigation map with variability based on apparent electrical conductivity or elevation maps fig 1 this represented a standard vri practice where irrigation depths were scaled depending on underlying variability e g from apparent electrical conductivity or elevation map between 70 and 100 vri from soil water sw sensors vri sw apply irrigation depths to replenish the soil water profile these were calculated as the difference between the soil water content at field capacity and averaged soil water content over the three sensors the drained upper limit was measured from infield soil sampling vri from mpc maximising yield vri mpc the mpc strategy of mccarthy et al 2014 was implemented to maximise predicted final yield the model was parameterised from on site weather data soil properties and management information the mpc strategy was implemented in variwise to compare the predicted yield at multiple irrigation depths ranging from 0 mm i e no irrigation to the flat rate irrigation depth of the irrigation machine i e the irrigation depth configured during commercial operations yields were predicted with multiple irrigation depths at intervals of 5 mm in this range for example for an irrigation machine with flat rate irrigation depth of 15 mm with four irrigation depths were simulated 0 5 10 and 15 mm the irrigation depths implemented were those that produced the highest predicted yield lint yield for cotton and dry matter for perennial ryegrass if two irrigation depths produced the same predicted yield the lower irrigation depth was selected to be applied this trial focussed on comparing the performance of the irrigation strategies to determine spatial application depths rather than determining the timing of the irrigation events as the trials were conducted on commercial farms where the timing was controlled by the grower further trials may involve using the strategies to irrigate based on soil moisture environmental impacts rainfall forecast and estimated grazing dates for pasture variwise was updated from programmatic execution of the cotton model ozcot mccarthy et al 2010 to apsim version 7 10 build r4200 this involved developing software to generate an apsim simulation file containing the soil and management parameters calling the apsim executable and then reading the generated apsim output file 2 2 field site selection trial sites selected were a a seven span centre pivot irrigated cotton field with a deep epicalcareous self mulching black vertosol anon 2022 over four seasons near yargullen queensland australia and b a five span centre pivot irrigated perennial ryegrass pasture field with a deep red mesotrophic haplic ferrosol masters 2012 over two seasons near elliott tasmania australia table 1 some paddocks in the ryegrass site were on steep slopes that contained slump features or hummocky patterns due to vegetation clearance and subsequent mass movement moreton 1999 the seven span centre pivot used for four consecutive cotton seasons was towed between cotton fields each season at the cotton site a flat rate application depth of 15 mm was applied until early vegetative growth ceased and 30 mm depth was applied for the rest of the season while the ryegrass machine had a flat rate application depth of 15 mm the irrigation machine at the cotton site always irrigated in a clockwise direction while the irrigation machine at the perennial ryegrass site irrigated in both clockwise and anti clockwise directions as it was part circle the vri hardware on the cotton machine was valley vri is anon 2022 which enabled individual sprinkler control whilst the vri hardware on the ryegrass machine was valley vri zone control which enabled control of 30 zones along the machine agsense agsense 2017 was installed on both machines to enable remote control of the machines and upload of the vri maps in this trial the system was implemented to only reduce irrigation application depths such that the uniform irrigation strategy would apply the highest irrigation depth the accuracy of the angular position of the irrigation machine was verified by monitoring the application from test vri maps over landmarks in the field flags of the cotton site and laneways and fences for the ryegrass site and the angle was offset as required this was conducted for both directions of machine travel for the ryegrass site the irrigation machine uniformity and vri performance were verified in catch can trials for both irrigation machines this field process was used to identify uniformity in irrigation along the machine and ensure the vri hardware nozzles and speed control were accurately applying irrigation depths and these depths were consistent in each direction of machine travel for the ryegrass site at the cotton site grids of catch cans were installed at the centre of spans 2 7 with three rows of five catch cans along the machine at 1 5 m spacing following the methodology of o shaughnessy et al 2013 at the ryegrass site grids of catch cans were installed in span 5 with two rows of 20 catch cans at 1 7 m spacing parallel with the machine and two rows of 31 catch cans at 1 7 m spacing perpendicular with the machine fixed vri prescription maps were uploaded for the vri application for the cotton site the root mean square error rmse between prescribed and measured applied depths was 2 6 mm with an average applied irrigation depth of 28 0 mm whilst for the ryegrass site the rmse between prescribed and measured applied depths was 2 7 mm with an average applied depth of 12 3 mm this is consistent with the reported performance of vri systems e g rmse 3 0 mm mm o shaughnessy et al 2013 the variability in soil types was assessed in each field to select locations for replicates of treatments across the fields four in the cotton trials and five in the ryegrass trials the cotton fields were surveyed using a dualem 1s that records electromagnetic responses i e electrical conductivity to 50 cm and 150 cm depths fig 1 the average measured electrical conductivity differed for each cotton field potentially because of a difference in soil water content each time the survey was conducted the ryegrass field was surveyed using elevation mapping to determine a topographic wetness index where smaller indices indicated steeper slope and higher indices indicated areas with potential for runoff fig 1 plot locations in ryegrass trials were positioned between machine towers were contained within a paddock without laneways and were approximately homogeneous with minimal overland flow to ensure water infiltrated where it was applied soil cores were collected in the sampling locations with results in tables 2 and 3 for cotton and ryegrass respectively at the cotton site two replicates of samples were collected using a 35 mm diameter hydraulic soil sampling rig the cores were divided into 30 cm sections to a 90 cm depth at the ryegrass site three replicates of samples were collected using a steel ring with 72 5 mm internal diameter and 61 mm height which was hammered into the profile at each depth these samples were analysed to characterise parameters required for apsim bulk density drained upper limit lower limit saturated water content using predicted van genuchten soil water retention curve parameters with retc schaap et al 2001 a retention curve development software that quantifies the hydraulic functions of unsaturated soils simunek et al 2007 soil water characteristics from the online soil database apsoil www apsim info were also obtained for comparison the plant available water capacity was calculated for each sampling location table 2 as the difference between drained upper limit and crop lower limit wigginton et al 2012 soil texture was assessed using the hydrometer analysis method of gee and bauder 1986 the soil properties were compared with the underlying soil variability maps to ground truth the soil differences electrical conductivity and topogaphic wetness indices were extracted from the maps for the cotton and ryegrass sites respectively this involved averaging measurements within 15 m of each sampling location for comparison with soil properties at the same sampling location from table 2 for each cotton season the higher electrical conductivity corresponded with higher plant available water capacity silt and clay content and lower sand content and bulk density therefore the electrical conductivity map indicated variation in water holding capacity and soil texture from table 3 for the ryegrass site the higher topographic wetness index corresponded with higher plant available water capacity slump features and clay content and lower sand and silt content trial plots were assigned in each site and replicated with dimensions of size and spacing to ensure that the irrigation strategies were applied independently without overlap from adjacent management zones the plots were positioned to align with the vri management zones and areas irrigated with each strategy were at least 20 m wide and 30 m considering sprinkler throw distance if the management zones were larger than 20 m wide the plots were the width of the management zone higgins et al 2016 recommended a minimum management zone size of 23 m for the valley section control vri system used at their ryegrass site vri prescription maps were generated following the xml file format required for agsense and uploaded on days of irrigation the dates of irrigation events were determined by the onsite managers and growers the irrigation events were occasionally stopped before the whole field was irrigated because of rainfall this would have led to variations in irrigation applied depths between the replicates of the plots in the uniform irrigation plots for the cotton sites soil nitrate and ammonium nitrogen tests were conducted before the initial nitrogen application each season the grower applied approximately 250 n kg ha before planting and 60 n kg ha as a side dressing before flowering nitrogen would not have been a limiting factor for the irrigation sites as the average nitrogen requirement for cotton over a season to achieve high yields is about 250 n kg ha smith and welsh 2018 with 60 70 applied upfront and 30 40 applied as a side dressing prior to flowering baird 2022 2 3 data collection weather data was collected at each site and season to provide minimum and maximum daily temperature rainfall and solar radiation for apsim simulations automatic weather stations aws were installed at the sites environdata weathermaster 2000 at the cotton site and environdata weather maestro with middleton solar sensors at the ryegrass site weather data were obtained from the closest australian government s bureau of meteorology bom through ftp ftp bom gov au weather station oakey airport for cotton site and wynyard airport for ryegrass site interpolated regional weather station datasets from silo a queensland government database containing continuous daily climate data for australia since 1889 through https www longpaddock qld gov au silo were obtained for comparison with the onsite aws data table 4 provides a summary of the weather data from on site weather stations there were large variations in rainfall between the weather stations as expected which were caused by the large spatial variation in rainfall the solar radiation was lower from the silo station than the aws and bom which would lead to underestimation of the daily crop water use and yield the temperature was generally lower from the aws than bom at both cotton and ryegrass sites this may have been caused by the bom stations being located at airports which have differences in land use compared with the farm sites and enclosed conditions leading to microclimates johnston 2020 soil moisture was monitored at the centre of the vri sw plots using soil water sensors at the cotton sites ict international mp406 standing wave sensors which have an accuracy of 1 anon 2022 were installed at depths of 30 60 and 90 cm at the ryegrass site enviropro ep100gl 04 capacitance probes which have an accuracy of 2 enviropro 2022 were installed with sensors at 10 cm intervals to 40 cm the soil water measurement at each depth was logged every 15 minutes throughout the season the soil water sensor data was calibrated using the approach of pendergast and hare 2007 by i scaling the data such that the change in soil moisture matched the known irrigation depth applied and ii adjusting the soil water curve such that the maximum soil water content measured equalled the soil field capacity manual plant measurements were collected in the vri sw plots of the cotton site to assess the model accuracy these measurements were for the same five plants in the centre of each plot plant stand was assessed in each replicate after emergence and canopy width and square green boll and open boll counts were measured weekly yield was assessed in all plots at harvest from lint collected by hand from 1 m² in the centre of each plot the lint was weighed and a cotton turnout percentage was 40 from the same cultivar in previous commercial gin operations for the ryegrass sites grazing dates were required to record harvesting events in apsim grazing dates were manually recorded by observing pasture in images collected by oblique cameras in the vri sw and vri mpc plots of each replicate in the 2021 22 season the grazing events were verified using gps trackers on the cattle at the ryegrass site the plots were monitored weekly to compare in season crop growth patterns between irrigation strategies the centre of each ryegrass plot was assessed weekly using a c dax pasture meter pulled by a quadbike to measure the height of pasture swards and estimate dry matter yield the calibration provided by the onsite field staff to convert pasture height from the c dax to dry matter is shown in eq 1 this calibration was conducted with a rising plate meter at the site 1 dry matter kg ha past ure height cm 15 675 4 685 the centre of each cotton plot was monitored weekly using a dji phantom 4 uav to assess canopy cover and open bolls the uav mission was developed using litchi software top view images were captured approximately 3 m from the ground while the uav was hovering so there was no thrust or propeller wind on the crop canopy fig 2 image analysis algorithms were implemented to extract fractional canopy cover using plant segmentation kumar and miklavcic 2018 and open boll area that extracts ratio of white pixels to all pixels yeom et al 2018 the image analysis outputs for canopy cover and open boll area were compared with the measured canopy width and open boll counts respectively to verify accuracy for indicating in season crop growth fig 3 the open boll area analysis was focussed on the images collected at defoliation as these would be most correlated with the open boll counts there were very strong correlations between the measured canopy width and canopy cover detected by uav image analysis r² 0 897 and the measured open bolls and open boll area detected by uav image analysis r² 0 718 the lower coefficient of determination for open boll area was expected as not all open bolls were visible from the top view of the plant 2 4 model and irrigation performance evaluation the accuracy of apsim with weather and soil data from different sources was evaluated to confirm whether on or off field data sources were required in apsim the weather source was programmatically updated by referring the apsim model to a text file containing the weather data from the specified source while the soil data source was programmatically updated in the apsim xml file used to run the model no other parameters were varied for this evaluation potential weather sources compared include regional weather stations bom and silo and the on site automatic weather station aws potential soil data sources include infield core samples and soil water characteristics obtained from online database apsoil apsim outputs from parameterised simulations were compared with field measurements using coefficients of determination r² and root mean square error rmse cotton field measurements compared include square counts green and open boll counts per m² canopy cover soil moisture mm and lint yield kg ha whilst ryegrass field measurements compared include height mm dry matter kg dm ha and soil moisture mm for both crops soil moisture measurements were obtained from the infield sensors for cotton canopy cover was obtained from the daily infield camera images and square and boll counts and lint yield were obtained from manual measurements whilst for ryegrass height and dry matter were obtained from weekly fortnightly c dax sensor data the irrigation strategies were implemented for each whole ryegrass season and from approximately 40 days after sowing for each cotton season the irrigation strategies were evaluated from measured end of season yield total irrigation applied irrigation water use index iwui gross production water use index gpwui and weekly crop growth features yield was interpreted as lint yield for cotton and dry matter yield for ryegrass irrigation applied was calculated from applied irrigation depths in the vri maps iwui was calculated as the ratio between yield and total irrigation applied gpwui was calculated as the ratio between yield and total water used by the crop which was the sum of the soil moisture change effective irrigation applied and effective rainfall the soil moisture change was the difference between the start and end simulated soil moisture over the season effective irrigation applied was calculated assuming 90 efficiency in the irrigation application smith et al 2014 multiple approaches are reported for calculating effective rainfall e g ali and mubarak 2017 for this application effective rainfall was calculated from the rainfall recorded by the onsite automatic weather station where for ryegrass the first 2 mm and over 25 mm were ineffective and for cotton the first 3 mm was ineffective and only 70 of the remaining rainfall was effective the percentage differences in irrigation applied yield and iwui were compared with the uniform and vri fixed irrigation strategies variations over fields were evaluated using standard deviations ryegrass yield was assessed from the average daily dry matter growth and dry matter yield the average daily dry matter growth was calculated from a weighted average of positive changes in biomass between c dax samples the dry matter yield was calculated by multiplying the average daily dry matter growth with the number of days between the first and last c dax samples in the irrigation season 155 days in 2020 21 and 133 days in 2021 22 the weekly crop growth was assessed using the uav for cotton and c dax for ryegrass to compare with changes in irrigation depths applied the differences for each strategy in irrigation application depths yield iwui and growth parameters were also compared with the plant available water capacity soil texture and or elevation parameters for ryegrass to identify impacts from soil or slope properties on the performance in each field and season 3 results and discussion 3 1 prediction accuracy table 5 presents the accuracy of apsim for cotton simulation using weather and soil data from different sources apsim most accurately predicted lint yield using weather data from on site aws and soil data from infield soil cores with r² 0 733 and rmse 153 9 kg ha using infield cores and r² 0 749 and rmse 191 9 kg ha using apsoil weather data source had a greater influence on simulation accuracy of lint yield than soil data source with input from bom being slightly more accurate than from silo from table 3 the largest difference in weather parameters between weather data sources was for rainfall which may have caused this variation in simulation performance apsim most accurately predicted lint yield and canopy cover and least accurately predicted soil water content and fruiting parameters across weather and soil data inputs the low accuracies in soil water content may have been caused by the model not accurately reflecting the differences in water use or evaporation due to the row configuration being 1 5 m rather than 1 m which is generally used for australian cotton in addition soil water was measured daily and the model may have been unable to accurately reflect daily fluctuations as measured the lower prediction accuracies for square and boll counts may have been caused the delay in the apsim simulated fruit development compared with the field measurements as reported in the literature the soil texture information not being incorporated into apsim may have contributed to inaccurate rate of soil water extraction which led to differences in fruit development however apsim may have represented soil texture information through the soil water related parameters table 6 presents the accuracy of apsim for grazed ryegrass pasture simulation using weather and soil data from different sources to evaluate the most suitable data source for parameterisation apsim was most accurate using aws or bom weather data and soil core information with accuracy of dry matter being r² 0 336 0 355 and rmse 295 3 331 1 kg ha using infield cores and r² 0 353 0 364 and rmse 301 1 336 4 kg ha using apsoil for ryegrass soil data source had a greater influence on simulation accuracy than weather data source with similar performance across the different weather stations this contrasts with cotton simulations where weather data source was more influential than soil data source this may be caused by less variation in weather measurements particularly solar radiation between weather stations for the ryegrass site compared with the cotton site apsim could more accurately simulate height and dry matter than soil moisture apsim most accurately predicted dry matter and height and least accurately predicted soil water content across weather and soil data inputs as for the cotton simulations the low accuracies in predicted soil water content may have been caused by the highly fluctuating nature of soil water data over short time spans that is not well represented in the model overall the coefficients of determination were lower for ryegrass simulations overall highest r² 0 366 compared with cotton simulations this may be caused by slight variations in accuracy around grazing events 3 2 irrigation strategy performance cotton table 7 and fig 4 compare the performance of the uniform irrigation and vri strategies in field trials for cotton whilst fig 5 compares the irrigation applied by each strategy during the 2018 19 season the irrigation machine had insufficient system capacity to deliver the crop s water requirements because of high temperatures and low rainfall this led to the uniform irrigation strategy producing the highest yield in 2018 19 during the 2021 22 season the crop yield was significantly lower because of two flood events and cooler temperatures leading to similar performance across all strategies from table 7 during the 2019 20 and 2020 21 cotton growing seasons the highest iwui and gpwui and lowest irrigation applied were achieved using the vri mpc approach followed by vri sw vri fixed and uniform irrigation from fig 4 over all seasons compared with vri fixed vri mpc produced 4 9 more yield with 5 6 less water vri sw produced 5 5 more yield with the same water and uniform irrigation produced 4 7 more yield with 7 2 more water over 2019 20 and 2020 21 compared with vri fixed vri mpc produced 0 5 more yield with 8 5 less water vri sw produced 0 5 less yield with 1 7 more water and uniform irrigation produced 2 2 less cotton yield with 5 3 more water there was no statistical difference in irrigation or yield between the strategies from fig 4 over all cotton growing seasons compared with uniform irrigation vri mpc produced 0 3 more yield with 11 7 less water vri sw produced 0 9 more yield with 6 1 less water and vri fixed produced 2 7 less yield with 6 4 less water over 2019 20 and 2020 21 compared with uniform irrigation vri mpc produced 2 8 more yield with 13 0 less water vri sw produced 1 8 more yield with 3 3 less water and vri fixed produced 2 6 more yield with 4 9 less water the difference in irrigation application between the uniform and the vri fixed plots was significant at the 0 05 level overall the strategies had a larger impact on irrigation applied rather than cotton yield this suggests that with the water available weather and management used from the trial site the approximate maximum yield was achieved with all strategies however the vri mpc strategy reduced the irrigation applied to obtain this yield this also indicates that the model optimisation used in vri mpc strategy can identify irrigation water savings without impacting yield there is potential for different strategies to be applied depending on the market value of cotton and water there is also potential for a similar model based irrigation strategy to include consideration of environmental impacts from fig 5 in all seasons similar irrigation depths were applied by all strategies until flowering in the 2020 21 and 2021 22 seasons irrigation applications were reduced after 80 100 days after sowing which was after peak bloom water stress during peak bloom to open bolls can cause young boll shedding but has less impact on yield than loss of early season bolls in the 2018 19 and 2019 20 seasons the vri mpc strategy also reduced irrigation applications at approximately 120 days after sowing which coincided with boll opening less water applied during peak boll opening may hasten boll opening improving defoliation and reducing regrowth leading to increased yield and fibre quality from table 7 the maximum cotton canopy cover and open boll area were similar across all strategies there was less variation in the date of maximum boll area than maximum canopy cover the vri fixed strategy produced the highest maximum canopy cover which occurred slightly later than the other strategies the vri sw strategy produced the highest maximum open boll area which occurred slightly later than the other irrigation strategies figs 6 and 7 compare the irrigation cotton lint yield and maximum canopy cover and open boll area in each plot and strategy with the plant available water content and silt content respectively these show the yield and maximum canopy cover and open boll area being positively correlated with the plant available water capacity and silt content this is because silty soils hold the most available water to plants and soils with higher capacity store water and enable extraction of water better by crops during dry growing seasons no strong correlations were observed between irrigation yield or cotton development and bulk density sand or clay content the performance of mpc may have been limited by the accuracy of apsim in particular the delay in the simulated physiological responses may have led to the irrigation strategy inaccurately assessing growth stage and corresponding irrigation requirement in addition apsim did not consider soil texture which was found to be highly influential on yield there is potential for improvements in the performance of model based management decisions with further development of the crop and soil prediction components in apsim the benefit of mpc may be larger in fields with more variation in soil properties which could be verified in further trials there is potential for further work to identify guidelines for field selection with sufficient variability to implement the system 3 3 irrigation strategy performance ryegrass table 8 and fig 8 compare the performance of the uniform irrigation and vri strategies in field trials for ryegrass while fig 9 compares the irrigation applied by each strategy from table 8 the highest iwui and gpwui for ryegrass and lowest irrigation applied were achieved using the vri mpc approach followed by vri sw vri fixed and uniform irrigation from fig 8 compared with vri fixed vri mpc produced 8 5 more dry matter yield with 5 4 less water vri sw produced 7 4 less dry matter yield with 2 9 more water and uniform irrigation produced 6 2 more yield with 14 4 more water the vri mpc strategy resulted in the highest water use efficiency whilst the uniform irrigation strategy applied the most water compared with uniform irrigation vri mpc produced 9 0 more dry matter yield with 16 9 less water vri sw produced 9 2 less dry matter yield with 9 9 less water and vri fixed produced 4 5 more dry matter yield with 12 4 less water all vri strategies increased yield and applied less water than the uniform strategy and vri mpc and vri sw strategies produced the largest yield improvements there was no statistical difference in irrigation or yield between the strategies the difference in irrigation application between the uniform and the vri fixed plots was significant at the 0 05 level from fig 9 the uniform strategy applied more water across all pasture growth stages the vri strategies applied lower irrigation depths from up to 5 days after grazing after which the vri mpc strategy applied slightly less water compared with the other vri strategies it is expected the water savings using vri mpc occurred because water applications were reduced to coincide with the lower ryegrass water requirement after grazing this reduced irrigation application while still meeting the pasture s needs may have led to less water saturation resulting in improved growth it is also noted that the vri mpc could meet the crop s water needs despite the lower accuracies of apsim simulations of ryegrass yield compared with cotton lint yield this indicates that the model could extract relative rather than absolute yield responses to different volume water there were larger variations in responses between plots in the ryegrass than cotton trials at the same time the pasture grown slightly increased with higher topographic wetness indices and slump features potentially because in these locations the pasture was more protected which led to improved pasture cover the pasture grown slightly decreased with higher sand and silt content potentially because of the reduced water holding capacity of these soils which may have impacted the crop during dry periods of the season however thess trend were only slight because of low spatial variation in plant available water capacity between replicates this suggests that the variations between plots were due to pasture compositions between paddocks e g dock clumps and or slump features rather than water capacity from table 8 the highest dry matter yield was achieved using the vri mpc strategy followed by vri sw uniform irrigation and vri fixed the uniform irrigation strategy had the highest average daily pasture growth rate possibly caused by rapid growth after grazing from the higher irrigation depths but then a reduction in growth caused by overwatering in later stages leading to reduced harvested herbage the reported trial focussed on using the vri techniques to adjust irrigation volumes on days of irrigation events at the commercial sites there is potential for further productivity improvements if the strategies were applied to determine when to start irrigating potentially based on soil moisture status forecast rainfall and grazing events for pasture in addition the vri mpc strategy could be adapted to economic and environmental impact optimisation by linking with water production costs run off or leaching parameters the performance of mpc may have been limited by the accuracy of apsim for predicting daily soil dynamics over short time spans this may have influenced the ryegrass simulations more than the cotton simulations because of the shorter seasons this is because the grazed pasture had a harvest event at each grazing which was optimised whilst the cotton had only one harvest event and target for optimisation in a commercial field implementation the system may be limited by the need for daily grazing information this would require either cattle trackers infield pasture sensors or manual data input which are not standard in current systems 4 conclusions field trials have been conducted over four cotton seasons and two perennial ryegrass seasons to evaluate the accuracy of the yield prediction of a biophysical model and compare field performance of uniform and variable rate irrigation strategies the predicted yield from the biophysical crop model was most accurate using on site weather data and soil core information with r² 0 733 and rmse 153 9 kg ha for cotton and rmse 127 4 kg ha for ryegrass for all season from the cotton field trials variable rate irrigation strategies had a larger impact on irrigation applied rather than yield with model predictive control led to 4 9 more yield with 5 6 reduced water application compared with standard vri water savings occurred through reduced water after peak bloom and or open boll physiological stages for grazed ryegrass the model predictive control strategy led to 8 5 more yield with 5 4 reduced water application compared with standard vri potentially caused by reduced application after grazing events the performance of all strategies was affected by plant available water capacity for cotton and slope for ryegrass there is potential for the strategy performance to improve with more accurate models for new varieties soil texture and short time span dynamics e g soil moisture further work includes evaluating the model predictive control strategy with economic and or environmental impact optimisation controlling irrigation event

9121,investigating the quantity and quality interaction of the surface and groundwater resources plays an essential role in the integrated management of the surface and groundwater resources in this study to estimate the discharge and nitrate concentration of the interaction between the chadegan aquifer and the zayandeh roud reservoir a quantitative qualitative simulation model is developed using modflow and mt3dms codes here the model is calibrated using the data from the beginning of winter 2011 to the end of winter 2014 and validated for spring 2014 to summer 2020 for the quantitative calibration in the steady and unsteady conditions the rmse values of the water level are 0 74 m and 1 84 m respectively and for the qualitative calibration the measured nitrate concentration values is 1 89 mg l in addition for the validation state of the proposed model the values of rmse for the water levels and nitrate concentrations are 3 76 m and 2 85 mg l respectively the results indicate that the aquifer has always been recharged by the reservoir during this time in addition the exchange nitrate concentration value is between 39 56 and 48 85 mg l the decreasing trend of the water level and the increase in the nitrate concentration which exceed the permissible limit in some areas indicate the necessity of adopting the immediate managerial policies five managerial scenarios are proposed and the effect on the aquifer conditions in terms of increase in the water level and the decrease of nitrate concentration is investigated the results indicate that the 20 gradual reduction of the agricultural water consumption and simultaneously a 20 gradual reduction in nitrate fertilizers consumption and completing the urban wastewater treatment systems is the most effective quantitative qualitative scenario for this region with a 0 24 increase in the average water level and a 11 36 decrease in the average concentration of the nitrate in the aquifer by the end of the forecasting period keywords interaction surface and groundwater resources quantitative and qualitative simulation nitrate chadegan aquifer zayandeh roud reservoir data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in recent decades due to population growth and agricultural and industrial development the use of surface and groundwater resources has increased significantly monitoring the groundwater as a reliable backup resource has led to the fact that the water shortage can be compensated by withdrawal from the groundwater when the surface water resources are not able to satisfy the demands however this fact led to excessive illegal and even unauthorized groundwater withdrawal in such a way the existence of many unauthorized and uncontrollable wells and unauthorized extension of wells in drought seasons have faced the groundwater resources with severe and irreparable challenges and damages in general adopting the appropriate management decisions and preventing the shortage and pollution crisis of water resources requires the constant monitoring of their quantity and quality in addition the surface and groundwater interaction is an essential role in the water values of resources and the concentration values of qualitative parameters therefore to accurately estimate the management decisions influences on each of the surface and groundwater resources and their effects on other resources the exchange impact and the interaction of these resources should be considered several studies have been done to investigate the interaction of surface and groundwater resources using different methods these methods include direct measurement of interaction isiorho and meyer 1999 krupa et al 1998 libelo and macintyre 1994 murdoch and kelly 2003

cochand et al 2020 freitas et al 2019 in general to study the interaction of the surface and groundwater resources these resources should be simulated and analyzed reviewing of the researches in this field shows that various software have been used for quantity and quality conjunctive simulation of the surface and groundwater resources in these researches the analytical or numerical models such as

rakhimbekova et al 2021 and hgs 11 11 hydrogeologic sphere model haque et al 2021 are used reviewing the researches shows that the quantity and quality interaction of the surface and groundwater resources plays an essential role in management decisions the exchanged discharge between these resources shows how the quantitative and qualitative parameters of one resource change due to fluctuations of that parameter in another resource therefore various methods have been proposed and used to simulate the quantity and quality of the surface and groundwater resources however due to various uncertainties in the quantitative and qualitative conjunctive simulation of these resources most of the time this problem is solved by considering simplified assumptions and approximations in addition according to the reviewed research the use of modflow and mt3dms codes is one of the most common and in many cases the best methods for the quantitative and qualitative simulation of the surface and groundwater resources therefore in this study these two codes are used to investigate the interaction of the surface and groundwater resources in the chadegan aquifer located in the zayandeh roud catchment zayandeh roud catchment includes 13 active aquifers due to the water exchange of aquifer with the zayandeh roud reservoir the chadegan aquifer is one of the most sensitive of them in this region the existence of potential agricultural lands has led to extensive and diverse agricultural activities in addition the excessive consumption of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and the infiltration of agricultural drainage into groundwater resources have polluted the water resources another significant pollution resource is the wastewater entrance into the aquifer through absorption wells due to the lack of wastewater treatment plants in some cities and villages near the zayandeh roud river therefore here modflow and mt3dms codes are used for quantitative and qualitative simulation of the chadegan aquifer located near the zayandeh roud reservoir considering as a surface water resource in addition different management scenarios are proposed for this region finally the impact of each of them on the quantity and quality of the surface and groundwater resources are investigated 2 chadegan catchment chadegan sub catchment with an area of 426 km2 is a part of the gavkhooni basin located in the northwestern part of the basin the location of this sub catchment is presented in fig 1 this catchment includes plains with the area of 258 6 km2 and mountains with the area of 167 5 km2 the minimum height is 2058 m above msl mean sea level located at the southern part of the catchment near the zayandeh roud reservoir and its maximum height is 2632 m above msl located in the northern part according to available data from 1968 to 2012 in the mountain and plain areas the average temperature is 8 6 and 9 3 c the average precipitation is 367 and 337 millimeter mm the average evaporation is 1902 4 and 2038 5 mm and the average evaporation from the free surface water is 1430 and 1518 mm respectively samandgan is the main river in this region which is the seasonal river that flows in winter and spring into the zayandeh roud reservoir the average discharge is 0 34 m3 s with a total annual outflow of 10 7 mcm although flow in this river can recharge the aquifer however the exchanged water is negligible due to the low discharge the lateral inflow from other catchments is negligible due to rigid layers in boundary areas in addition although the aquifer is not interconnected with the neighboring aquifers however there is a direct connection with the zayandeh roud reservoir at the downstream boundary as shown in fig 1 according to the pumping test done for two wells at the center and east the estimated transmissivity values are 405 67 and 50 5 m2 day respectively furthermore the value of the specific yield is 0 65 the geologic condition of the region is predominantly clay sand and gravel according to drilling log information and geological maps isfahan regional water company 2012 the number of exploitation wells springs and aqueducts related to the aquifer is 262 73 and 24 respectively ministry of energy 2015 the locations of quantity and quality monitoring wells are shown in fig 2 3 methodology 3 1 simulation procedure modflow and mt3dms software are used in this research for the quantitative and qualitative simulation of the chadegan aquifer and its interaction with the zayandeh roud reservoir modflow is the most commonly used numerical three dimensional groundwater flow model developed by the us geological survey and applied for saturated zones harbaugh 2005 numerous data preparation facilities simple data exchange in standard form extensive global experience continuous growth and source code availability are the main advantages of modflow kumar and gour 2021 the finite difference technique is used in modflow for simulation of groundwater flow within the aquifer and three dimensional contaminant transport and groundwater flow furthermore mt3dms is a three dimensional numerical model that can be applied to simulate solute transport in hydrogeological settings it is a modflow s 3 d advection dispersion sorption and reaction simulation module in addition mt3dms involves chemical reactions such as advection dispersion and diffusion zheng et al 2012 for the quantitative and qualitative simulation of the chadegan aquifer at first by comparing the aquifer water level in the vicinity of the reservoir with the water level of the reservoir the exchanged flow direction can be determined and applied at boundary conditions then the estimated exchanged discharge can be considered as inflow or outflow discharge of the reservoir according to the reservoir and the aquifer water level in addition by using geostatistical methods the nitrate concentration values of the reservoir in the vicinity of the aquifer are estimated and considered as the model boundary conditions the first step of the quantitative simulation is preparing input data for the model to identify and remove outlier data of discharge in different months the values of the first and third quarters are calculated and then the upper and lower limits of data are determined this process is applied for monthly discharge of operation wells aqueducts and water depth of each observation well for selecting the appropriate time for modeling the steady state condition different factors such as the availability of data and the establishment of fairly steady state conditions are considered therefore february 2011 is selected here the torrent white method is used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration in which the soil moisture storage is assumed to 100 mm technical committee of atlas of water resources 1996 since the chadegan aquifer is unconfined it is recharged directly through precipitation in addition due to mild ground slope and vegetation in agricultural land a large volume of effective precipitation infiltrate into the aquifer and therefore the runoff values from precipitation are not considered for modeling in addition the volume of water evaporated from the aquifer is negligible due to the far distance of the groundwater level to the ground it is worth noting that required data for modeling include inlet and outlet boundary length groundwater hydraulic gradient and average transmissivity for inlet and outlet boundaries which are determined according to the groundwater transmissivity and water level maps then the groundwater inflow or outflow values are calculated using darcy equation the hydraulic gradient values of the inlet sections vary between 0 004 and 0 008 and they decrease from the eastern regions to the center of the plain in addition the aquifer bounds topographic map bedrock level contour lines and initial values of the water level of the aquifer are defined for modeling the mesh size is chosen 300 m by 300 m according to the dimensions and area of the aquifer and the distance of the wells from each other to estimate the values of bedrock level initial water level and initial nitrate concentration in different parts of the aquifer here different interpolation methods including inverse distance weighted idw kriging ordinary and universal trend global and local spline regularized and tension natural neighbor nn and triangulated irregular network tin are used a comparison of results showed that the lowest accurate results are obtained by using regularized spline method in addition the highest accurate results are obtained by using ordinary kriging method however this method is not practical for the points in the vicinity of the boundaries in contrast the idw method can be used for interpolation in all parts of the region in addition using nn and tin methods requires adequate data with the appropriate arrangement therefore the results of the idw method are finally selected for simulation then the aquifer is polygonized in a way that each polygon consists of at least one observation well and the hydraulic conductivity in each polygon is homological details of aquifer simulation including the networking the configuration of the aquifer polygonization the topography map and the bedrock level map are shown in fig 3 these values are considered as the initial values of k in each polygon and they are subsequently modified in the calibration process of the model since flood irrigation is mostly used in the region the return water coefficient value is equal to 0 25 furthermore the infiltration of domestic wastewater that disposal system is absorption wells is considered to70 the boundary conditions are determined according to the corresponding layer rigidity or impermeability the type of land layers in each boundary and the conditions of the adjacent area such as the existence of a or another aquifer the slope of the area and the groundwater hydraulic gradient to calibrate the model it may be necessary to modify the values of boundary conditions and recharge values of precipitation or agricultural lands in some polygons this step is continued until the desired accuracy is reached upon completion of the calibration step the k values are determined and the water levels are estimated at different points here the calibration process of the chadegan aquifer is done from winter 2011 to the end of winter 2014 the hydrodynamic coefficient values of each polygon obtained from the calibration process are presented in table 1 the results show that the hydraulic conductivity k and the specific yield coefficient values vary between 1 15 and 58 85 m day and 4 00 22 5 respectively the model is validated using the data from the beginning of spring 2014 to the end of summer 2020 here the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse indices are calculated to investigate the accuracy of the obtained results of the water level and nitrate concentration for calibration and validation processes the obtained results are presented in table 2 comparison of the validation stage results of the quantity model shows that the mae and rmse indices are 3 59 m and 3 76 m respectively in addition by using this model acceptable results are obtained for the calibration and validation stages in general the sensitivity analysis of the effective parameters such as hydraulic conductivity and specific yield coefficient is done for quantity model this information is useful for determining those parameters have the greatest effect on the results of modeling as well as those parameters have the least effect therefore the insensitive parameters can be removed or constant in a subsequent run for example the obtained results for the sensitivity analysis of hydraulic conductivity are shown in fig 4 comparison of the obtained results shows that the model sensitivity of the hydraulic conductivity values in polygon number 9 is more than other polygons after polygon number 9 sensitivity of the hydraulic conductivity values in polygon number 6 is more than other polygons therefore in the calibration process changing the hydraulic coefficients values of these polygons will extremely affect the results here mt3dms s w is used to simulate nitrate concentration in the aquifer the prerequisites for qualitative modeling are the aquifer boundaries model domain and network topography bedrock elevation and water level variation in each iteration which are all called from modflow s w in addition the initial values of nitrate concentration are estimated by applying the idw interpolation methods using the measured values in the winter of 2011 furthermore the values of the porosity coefficient longitudinal dispersivity coefficient and the ratio of horizontal and vertical transverse dispersivity to longitudinal dispersivity should be determined according to the research of anderson and cherry 1979 the initial values of longitudinal dispersivity are considered in the range of 30 100 m in addition according to the research of benjakul 2010 the ratios of horizontal and vertical transverse dispersivity to longitudinal dispersivity are considered 0 1 and 0 01 respectively for the calibration process the nitrate concentration in observation wells is measured twice a year therefore the qualitative modeling is done considering 6 month time steps in general nitrate sources are recharging from precipitation and agriculture returned flow absorption wells and the inlet boundaries of the aquifer the nitrate concentration of agricultural returned flow is calculated according to the dominant cultivation pattern in different parts of the region by dividing the used fertilizer by the water requirement of that crop per hectare according to the population of each section and the pollution load produced by each person the amount of nitrate intrusion through absorption well is estimated the results of the quality model are presented in table 3 the results indicate that the porosity values are between 26 and 36 and the longitudinal dispersivity coefficients are between 26 and 68 m2 day it is worth noting that the quality model is validated for the same period of the quantitative modeling the obtained results are presented in table 4 comparison of the validation stage results of the quality model shows that the mae and rmse indices are 2 51 and 2 85 mg l respectively small error values in the validation stage indicate the correctness of the results in the calibration stage finally the details of quantitative and qualitative modeling are presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively 3 2 management scenarios definition two possible conditions are considered to assess the future trend of the chadegan aquifer during the next 5 years as follows 1 the current trend considering severe drought conditions first scenario 2 increase in zayandeh roud reservoir storage to the normal operating water level second scenario for the first proposed scenario at first the future precipitation conditions should be estimated in the meteorological drought conditions here standardized precipitation index spi is used to estimate the precipitation regimes mckee et al 1993 using this index the spi 2 00 indicates the extremely dry conditions hayes et al 1999 for this purpose data of rain gauge stations located in the study area with a statistical period of 30 years 1990 2019 are used in recent years due to increase in the downstream water consumption and reduction of water inflow as a result of drought and upstream withdrawals the dam storage is drastically reduced from normal storage of 1250 mcm water level at 2060 m above msl to the lowest 195 6 mcm 2020 m above msl in summer 2020 this matter has consequent effects on the groundwater and reservoir interaction a moderately wet year and controlling the downstream water consumption are assumed therefore it is expected that the storage volume reach up to the normal level the effects of the severe drought conditions and increasing the reservoir water level on the flow direction and quality of the aquifer are estimated by numerical simulation of these two scenarios furthermore three practical managerial scenarios are proposed to improve the quantity and quality conditions of the chadegan aquifer by reducing the water consumption and sources of nitrate pollutants simultaneously these scenarios are presented as follows 1 20 gradual reduction of the agricultural water consumption by increasing the irrigation efficiency and a 20 gradual reduction in nitrate fertilizers consumption during 5 years third scenario 2 20 gradual reduction of the agricultural water consumption and equipping and completing the wastewater collection system during 5 years fourth scenario 3 combining the third and fourth scenarios fifth scenario it should be noted that to reduce the water consumption of agricultural activity various methods can be used including the developing the greenhouse cultivation developing the drip irrigation changing the cultivation pattern and managing the irrigation time in addition to reduce the consumption of nitrogen fertilizers the farmers should be trained for proper fertilization based on the cultivation pattern soil type irrigation type and the region s climate furthermore in this region due to the development of onion cultivation in recent years and the high consumption of nitrogen fertilizers for this product the concentration of this parameter can be reduced by changing the cultivation pattern therefore a reduction of fertilizer consumption and a reduction of about 20 of water use for irrigation 4 results and discussion in this section the obtained results of proposed approaches and scenarios are presented and compared 4 1 quantitative modeling in the chadegan region the obtained results of quantitative modeling show that in most of the wet years the minimum aquifer water level is seen in the september and the maximum level is seen in the april for this aquifer the water level is highly related to precipitation therefore by changing the precipitation in different years the water level of the aquifer changes in the same proportion for this region the maximum water level is 2350 m in the northwestern parts and the minimum water level is 2120 m near the zayandeh roud reservoir in the north part water level contours of the aquifer have a northeast southwest trend and in the center and south parts the trend deviates more to the east west and decreases from the east to the west the results of modeling indicate that the maximum water depth is 55 m located in the east of the aquifer near the maroofabad village the lowest water depth is 20 m in the south and northwest and the average water depth is 33 m the observation data and quantitative simulation of this aquifer reveal that the water level is gradually decreasing during the simulation period the amount of decrease in different parts of the aquifer varies between 3 and 17 m the lowest value occurs near the zayandeh roud reservoir and the highest value occurs near the analoucheh and maroofabad villages in the east 4 2 quantitative modeling in the chadegan region the obtained results of quantitative modeling show that in the south part the nitrate concentration is higher than in the north in the most years as well as this parameter decreases in the spring and summer and increases in the fall and winter the aquifer is highly dependent on the area under cultivation in which the highest value is 66 mg l occurred near the absorption wells the lowest value is 5 mg l in the northwest of the aquifer and the average value is 34 mg l it should be noted that the allowable limit of nitrate concentration value for drinking water is equal to 50 mg l institute of standards and industrial research of iran no 1053 this indicates that although the average concentration of nitrate in this aquifer is less than the allowable limitation however near the wastewater wells it is higher than the allowable value as well as investigating the international standards such as the drinking water standards of canada south korea and australia where the nitrate concentration for drinking water is limited to 10 mg l the nitrate concentration value is unacceptable the obtained results show that in some parts of the region the nitrate concentration values are higher than the allowable limit for drinking furthermore the increasing trend of this value highlights the necessity of using management scenarios to control the nitrate concentration value the obtained results of aquifer water levels in different parts of aquifer indicate a gradual reduction of the nitrate concentration in addition the obtained values of the nitrate concentration show an increasing trend during the simulation period therefore if this trend continues the nitrate concentration values will exceed the allowable limitation these values indicate that in the southern half of the aquifer the nitrate concentration values exceeds the allowable limitation for drinking 50 mg l which may affect the zayandeh roud reservoir in the calibration and validation period the maximum water level drop values in the location of quantitative observation wells the average water level oscillation at the aquifer and the maximum and average nitrate concentration values for the aquifer are 7 75 m 2 49 m 71 mg l and 38 mg l respectively therefore applicable methods should be proposed to prevent the decreasing of water level and increasing the nitrate concentration value in the future in the next section the results of proposed management scenarios to improve the quantitative and qualitative conditions are presented and compared 4 3 management scenarios here two possible conditions in terms of groundwater and reservoir interaction and flow exchange are considered to assess the future trend of the chadegan aquifer during the next 5 years including the effects of the severe drought conditions the increase in reservoir water level in addition three applied management scenarios for the groundwater level and quality of the aquifer are proposed and used by numerical simulation the average water depth and the nitrate concentration values at the end of the forecasted period are presented in table 5 using proposed scenarios the results show that using management scenarios has a minor effect on the average water level and finally water storage volume however the overall quality of the water in the terms of nitrate concentration improves especially by using the fifth scenario in other words average water storage volumes of aquifer are 446 4 mcm 450 96 mcm 450 51 mcm 449 24 mcm and 449 24 mcm using scenario 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively in addition by using fifth scenario the average nitrate concentration value is decreased by 15 25 compared to first scenario furthermore during 1852 days 5 years the numbers of the days with nitrate concentration value above the allowable limitations are 628 604 575 590 and 522 days using scenario 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively it is worth noting that increasing the reservoir water level proposed in the second scenario has a minor effect on the average groundwater level water storage volume and nitrate concentration values finally the water level and nitrate concentration values at the end of the forecasted period for the proposed scenarios are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively the results shows that the patterns of groundwater level variation are almost similar incremental or decreasing in all scenarios and by moving from the northern areas to the southern areas its value decreases in addition the highest nitrate concentration is observed in the central and southern parts of the region and the lowest value is observed in the eastern part the results of fig 8 show that the local concentration at the position of absorption wells is considerably decreased by using scenarios 4 and 5 estimating the water depth and nitrate concentration values of observation wells the percentage values of the difference between the first and the other scenarios are presented in tables 6 and 7 respectively to investigate the impact of the management scenarios on groundwater level and the nitrate concentration values in these tables the positive and the negative values indicate the increasing and decreasing the parameter values respectively furthermore the percentage values of the difference between the second and the other scenarios are presented in tables 8 and 9 respectively to investigate the impact of the management scenarios on groundwater level and the nitrate concentration values by investigating the quantitative modeling for estimating the water level values using different scenarios the following results are obtained 1 investigating the results of tables 6 and 8 the obtained water level values of scenarios 4 and 5 are equal using these two scenarios the gradual reduction of water consumption of agricultural usage and developing the wastewater collection and treatment systems the amount of entrance wastewater of absorption wells reach to zero 2 investigating the results of tables 6 and 8 shows that for wells number 1 2 3 and 4 the rank of scenarios is scenario 3 scenario 4 or scenario 5 scenario 2 and scenario 1 respectively considering the water level values for wells number 5 6 7 8 and 9 the rank is scenario 2 scenario 3 scenario 4 or scenario 5 and scenario 1 respectively comparison of the results shows that only the rank of the scenario 2 changes for different wells this indicates that the scenario 2 affects the water level values in the southern half of the aquifer due to the relatively high slope of the aquifer bedrock 3 the seasonal changes of water level values are high in wells number 2 3 and 4 and they are medium in wells number 5 6 and 8 and finally they are low in wells number 1 7 and 9 it is worth noting that the location of these points for the operation wells and agricultural lands affect the water withdrawal of the aquifer in these areas 4 in all proposed scenarios the trend of water level changes increases in winter and spring and decreases in summer and fall due to recharging the aquifer from precipitation in winter and spring and high water withdrawal in summer and fall 5 investigating the average aquifer water level values at the end of the simulation period and comparing it with the obtained first scenario values presented in table 5 shows that the rank of scenarios are scenario 2 scenario 3 scenario 4 or scenario 5 and scenario 1 respectively by investigating the qualitative modeling for estimating the nitrate concentration values using different scenarios the following results are obtained 1 investigating the results of different proposed scenarios shows that the trend of nitrate concentration changes increases in fall and winter and decreases in spring and summer due to the effect of incorrect use of nitrate fertilizers in spring and summer 2 investigating the results of fig 6 shows that the highest amounts of seasonal changes of nitrate concentration are observed in the well number 12 it is worth noting that the existence of a great number of operation wells and the large area of agricultural lands around this well leads to more seasonal changes in nitrate concentration values 3 the lowest nitrate concentration value is observed in the southern half of the aquifer using the second proposed scenario and it is observed in other areas using the fifth proposed scenario 4 investigating the results of table 9 shows that in some places such as point 3 the amount of nitrate concentration value obtained by using scenarios 3 4 and 5 is more than related values of the first scenario due to the reduction of aquifer recharge from the agricultural return water 5 investigating the average values of aquifer nitrate concentration at the end of the simulation period and comparing it with the results of first scenario presented in table 6 show that the rank of the scenarios is scenario 5 scenario 3 scenario 4 scenario 2 and scenario 1 respectively 5 conclusions in recent years the integrated surface and groundwater numerical quality and quantity modeling have been improved significantly in this article considering the volume of water exchanged between the aquifer and the zayandeh roud reservoir the numerical model of the chadegan aquifer in the central of iran was developed modflow and mt3dms s w were used for modeling the quantitative qualitative interaction of the aquifer and the reservoir the model was calibrated and validated considering steady and unsteady conditions for the period of winter 2011 to the end of winter 2014 and from the beginning of spring 2014 to the end of summer 2020 respectively the results showed a significant decrease of the water level and an increase in the nitrate concentration values in addition in some places the amount of nitrate concentration was more than the allowable limitation for drinking to assess the future trends of the aquifer and to change the current pattern five possible management scenarios were proposed for numerical modeling the management scenarios included a 20 reduction of the groundwater withdrawal a 20 reduction of the fertilizers consumption and gradual improvement of urban wastewater treatment which the last two ones are the main sources of groundwater nitrate contamination the results of the numerical model for predicting the groundwater level during the coming 5 years indicate a 20 reduction of the water withdrawal for irrigation although stopping the declining trend the short terms improvement for aquifer remedial is insignificant in addition increasing the reservoir storage volume to the normal operating water level changed the hydraulic gradient of the exchange flow towards the aquifer and therefore the reservoir would recharge the aquifer this fact led to a significant increase of the water level near the wells while slightly affecting the average values due to the high slope of the aquifer bedrock furthermore the results of the numerical model indicate that a gradual reduction of the consumption of nitrate agricultural fertilizers would significantly improve the aquifer water quality on the other hand the treatment of the wastewater was not very effective for reduction of the aquifer nitrate concentration value however the nitrate concentration value near the wastewater wells significantly decreased locally in addition increasing the reservoir water level to the normal operational level the nitrate concentration value was sharply decreased near the reservoir due to the minor effect of water inflow of the reservoir to the aquifer on the average concentration value declaration of

9121,investigating the quantity and quality interaction of the surface and groundwater resources plays an essential role in the integrated management of the surface and groundwater resources in this study to estimate the discharge and nitrate concentration of the interaction between the chadegan aquifer and the zayandeh roud reservoir a quantitative qualitative simulation model is developed using modflow and mt3dms codes here the model is calibrated using the data from the beginning of winter 2011 to the end of winter 2014 and validated for spring 2014 to summer 2020 for the quantitative calibration in the steady and unsteady conditions the rmse values of the water level are 0 74 m and 1 84 m respectively and for the qualitative calibration the measured nitrate concentration values is 1 89 mg l in addition for the validation state of the proposed model the values of rmse for the water levels and nitrate concentrations are 3 76 m and 2 85 mg l respectively the results indicate that the aquifer has always been recharged by the reservoir during this time in addition the exchange nitrate concentration value is between 39 56 and 48 85 mg l the decreasing trend of the water level and the increase in the nitrate concentration which exceed the permissible limit in some areas indicate the necessity of adopting the immediate managerial policies five managerial scenarios are proposed and the effect on the aquifer conditions in terms of increase in the water level and the decrease of nitrate concentration is investigated the results indicate that the 20 gradual reduction of the agricultural water consumption and simultaneously a 20 gradual reduction in nitrate fertilizers consumption and completing the urban wastewater treatment systems is the most effective quantitative qualitative scenario for this region with a 0 24 increase in the average water level and a 11 36 decrease in the average concentration of the nitrate in the aquifer by the end of the forecasting period keywords interaction surface and groundwater resources quantitative and qualitative simulation nitrate chadegan aquifer zayandeh roud reservoir data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in recent decades due to population growth and agricultural and industrial development the use of surface and groundwater resources has increased significantly monitoring the groundwater as a reliable backup resource has led to the fact that the water shortage can be compensated by withdrawal from the groundwater when the surface water resources are not able to satisfy the demands however this fact led to excessive illegal and even unauthorized groundwater withdrawal in such a way the existence of many unauthorized and uncontrollable wells and unauthorized extension of wells in drought seasons have faced the groundwater resources with severe and irreparable challenges and damages in general adopting the appropriate management decisions and preventing the shortage and pollution crisis of water resources requires the constant monitoring of their quantity and quality in addition the surface and groundwater interaction is an essential role in the water values of resources and the concentration values of qualitative parameters therefore to accurately estimate the management decisions influences on each of the surface and groundwater resources and their effects on other resources the exchange impact and the interaction of these resources should be considered several studies have been done to investigate the interaction of surface and groundwater resources using different methods these methods include direct measurement of interaction isiorho and meyer 1999 krupa et al 1998 libelo and macintyre 1994 murdoch and kelly 2003

cochand et al 2020 freitas et al 2019 in general to study the interaction of the surface and groundwater resources these resources should be simulated and analyzed reviewing of the researches in this field shows that various software have been used for quantity and quality conjunctive simulation of the surface and groundwater resources in these researches the analytical or numerical models such as distributed models baratelli et al 2016 sfwmm 1 1 south florida water management model software and modflow 2 2 modular three dimensional finite difference groundwater flow model code yan and smith

rakhimbekova et al 2021 and hgs 11 11 hydrogeologic sphere model haque et al 2021 are used reviewing the researches shows that the quantity and quality interaction of the surface and groundwater resources plays an essential role in management decisions the exchanged discharge between these resources shows how the quantitative and qualitative parameters of one resource change due to fluctuations of that parameter in another resource therefore various methods have been proposed and used to simulate the quantity and quality of the surface and groundwater resources however due to various uncertainties in the quantitative and qualitative conjunctive simulation of these resources most of the time this problem is solved by considering simplified assumptions and approximations in addition according to the reviewed research the use of modflow and mt3dms codes is one of the most common and in many cases the best methods for the quantitative and qualitative simulation of the surface and groundwater resources therefore in this study these two codes are used to investigate the interaction of the surface and groundwater resources in the chadegan aquifer located in the zayandeh roud catchment zayandeh roud catchment includes 13 active aquifers due to the water exchange of aquifer with the zayandeh roud reservoir the chadegan aquifer is one of the most sensitive of them in this region the existence of potential agricultural lands has led to extensive and diverse agricultural activities in addition the excessive consumption of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and the infiltration of agricultural drainage into groundwater resources have polluted the water resources another significant pollution resource is the wastewater entrance into the aquifer through absorption wells due to the lack of wastewater treatment plants in some cities and villages near the zayandeh roud river therefore here modflow and mt3dms codes are used for quantitative and qualitative simulation of the chadegan aquifer located near the zayandeh roud reservoir considering as a surface water resource in addition different management scenarios are proposed for this region finally the impact of each of them on the quantity and quality of the surface and groundwater resources are investigated 2 chadegan catchment chadegan sub catchment with an area of 426 km2 is a part of the gavkhooni basin located in the northwestern part of the basin the location of this sub catchment is presented in fig 1 this catchment includes plains with the area of 258 6 km2 and mountains with the area of 167 5 km2 the minimum height is 2058 m above msl mean sea level located at the southern part of the catchment near the zayandeh roud reservoir and its maximum height is 2632 m above msl located in the northern part according to available data from 1968 to 2012 in the mountain and plain areas the average temperature is 8 6 and 9 3 c the average precipitation is 367 and 337 millimeter mm the average evaporation is 1902 4 and 2038 5 mm and the average evaporation from the free surface water is 1430 and 1518 mm respectively samandgan is the main river in this region which is the seasonal river that flows in winter and spring into the zayandeh roud reservoir the average discharge is 0 34 m3 s with a total annual outflow of 10 7 mcm although flow in this river can recharge the aquifer however the exchanged water is negligible due to the low discharge the lateral inflow from other catchments is negligible due to rigid layers in boundary areas in addition although the aquifer is not interconnected with the neighboring aquifers however there is a direct connection with the zayandeh roud reservoir at the downstream boundary as shown in fig 1 according to the pumping test done for two wells at the center and east the estimated transmissivity values are 405 67 and 50 5 m2 day respectively furthermore the value of the specific yield is 0 65 the geologic condition of the region is predominantly clay sand and gravel according to drilling log information and geological maps isfahan regional water company 2012 the number of exploitation wells springs and aqueducts related to the aquifer is 262 73 and 24 respectively ministry of energy 2015 the locations of quantity and quality monitoring wells are shown in fig 2 3 methodology 3 1 simulation procedure modflow and mt3dms software are used in this research for the quantitative and qualitative simulation of the chadegan aquifer and its interaction with the zayandeh roud reservoir modflow is the most commonly used numerical three dimensional groundwater flow model developed by the us geological survey and applied for saturated zones harbaugh 2005 numerous data preparation facilities simple data exchange in standard form extensive global experience continuous growth and source code availability are the main advantages of modflow kumar and gour 2021 the finite difference technique is used in modflow for simulation of groundwater flow within the aquifer and three dimensional contaminant transport and groundwater flow furthermore mt3dms is a three dimensional numerical model that can be applied to simulate solute transport in hydrogeological settings it is a modflow s 3 d advection dispersion sorption and reaction simulation module in addition mt3dms involves chemical reactions such as advection dispersion and diffusion zheng et al 2012 for the quantitative and qualitative simulation of the chadegan aquifer at first by comparing the aquifer water level in the vicinity of the reservoir with the water level of the reservoir the exchanged flow direction can be determined and applied at boundary conditions then the estimated exchanged discharge can be considered as inflow or outflow discharge of the reservoir according to the reservoir and the aquifer water level in addition by using geostatistical methods the nitrate concentration values of the reservoir in the vicinity of the aquifer are estimated and considered as the model boundary conditions the first step of the quantitative simulation is preparing input data for the model to identify and remove outlier data of discharge in different months the values of the first and third quarters are calculated and then the upper and lower limits of data are determined this process is applied for monthly discharge of operation wells aqueducts and water depth of each observation well for selecting the appropriate time for modeling the steady state condition different factors such as the availability of data and the establishment of fairly steady state conditions are considered therefore february 2011 is selected here the torrent white method is used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration in which the soil moisture storage is assumed to 100 mm technical committee of atlas of water resources 1996 since the chadegan aquifer is unconfined it is recharged directly through precipitation in addition due to mild ground slope and vegetation in agricultural land a large volume of effective precipitation infiltrate into the aquifer and therefore the runoff values from precipitation are not considered for modeling in addition the volume of water evaporated from the aquifer is negligible due to the far distance of the groundwater level to the ground it is worth noting that required data for modeling include inlet and outlet boundary length groundwater hydraulic gradient and average transmissivity for inlet and outlet boundaries which are determined according to the groundwater transmissivity and water level maps then the groundwater inflow or outflow values are calculated using darcy equation the hydraulic gradient values of the inlet sections vary between 0 004 and 0 008 and they decrease from the eastern regions to the center of the plain in addition the aquifer bounds topographic map bedrock level contour lines and initial values of the water level of the aquifer are defined for modeling the mesh size is chosen 300 m by 300 m according to the dimensions and area of the aquifer and the distance of the wells from each other to estimate the values of bedrock level initial water level and initial nitrate concentration in different parts of the aquifer here different interpolation methods including inverse distance weighted idw kriging ordinary and universal trend global and local spline regularized and tension natural neighbor nn and triangulated irregular network tin are used a comparison of results showed that the lowest accurate results are obtained by using regularized spline method in addition the highest accurate results are obtained by using ordinary kriging method however this method is not practical for the points in the vicinity of the boundaries in contrast the idw method can be used for interpolation in all parts of the region in addition using nn and tin methods requires adequate data with the appropriate arrangement therefore the results of the idw method are finally selected for simulation then the aquifer is polygonized in a way that each polygon consists of at least one observation well and the hydraulic conductivity in each polygon is homological details of aquifer simulation including the networking the configuration of the aquifer polygonization the topography map and the bedrock level map are shown in fig 3 these values are considered as the initial values of k in each polygon and they are subsequently modified in the calibration process of the model since flood irrigation is mostly used in the region the return water coefficient value is equal to 0 25 furthermore the infiltration of domestic wastewater that disposal system is absorption wells is considered to70 the boundary conditions are determined according to the corresponding layer rigidity or impermeability the type of land layers in each boundary and the conditions of the adjacent area such as the existence of a or another aquifer the slope of the area and the groundwater hydraulic gradient to calibrate the model it may be necessary to modify the values of boundary conditions and recharge values of precipitation or agricultural lands in some polygons this step is continued until the desired accuracy is reached upon completion of the calibration step the k values are determined and the water levels are estimated at different points here the calibration process of the chadegan aquifer is done from winter 2011 to the end of winter 2014 the hydrodynamic coefficient values of each polygon obtained from the calibration process are presented in table 1 the results show that the hydraulic conductivity k and the specific yield coefficient values vary between 1 15 and 58 85 m day and 4 00 22 5 respectively the model is validated using the data from the beginning of spring 2014 to the end of summer 2020 here the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse indices are calculated to investigate the accuracy of the obtained results of the water level and nitrate concentration for calibration and validation processes the obtained results are presented in table 2 comparison of the validation stage results of the quantity model shows that the mae and rmse indices are 3 59 m and 3 76 m respectively in addition by using this model acceptable results are obtained for the calibration and validation stages in general the sensitivity analysis of the effective parameters such as hydraulic conductivity and specific yield coefficient is done for quantity model this information is useful for determining those parameters have the greatest effect on the results of modeling as well as those parameters have the least effect therefore the insensitive parameters can be removed or constant in a subsequent run for example the obtained results for the sensitivity analysis of hydraulic conductivity are shown in fig 4 comparison of the obtained results shows that the model sensitivity of the hydraulic conductivity values in polygon number 9 is more than other polygons after polygon number 9 sensitivity of the hydraulic conductivity values in polygon number 6 is more than other polygons therefore in the calibration process changing the hydraulic coefficients values of these polygons will extremely affect the results here mt3dms s w is used to simulate nitrate concentration in the aquifer the prerequisites for qualitative modeling are the aquifer boundaries model domain and network topography bedrock elevation and water level variation in each iteration which are all called from modflow s w in addition the initial values of nitrate concentration are estimated by applying the idw interpolation methods using the measured values in the winter of 2011 furthermore the values of the porosity coefficient longitudinal dispersivity coefficient and the ratio of horizontal and vertical transverse dispersivity to longitudinal dispersivity should be determined according to the research of anderson and cherry 1979 the initial values of longitudinal dispersivity are considered in the range of 30 100 m in addition according to the research of benjakul 2010 the ratios of horizontal and vertical transverse dispersivity to longitudinal dispersivity are considered 0 1 and 0 01 respectively for the calibration process the nitrate concentration in observation wells is measured twice a year therefore the qualitative modeling is done considering 6 month time steps in general nitrate sources are recharging from precipitation and agriculture returned flow absorption wells and the inlet boundaries of the aquifer the nitrate concentration of agricultural returned flow is calculated according to the dominant cultivation pattern in different parts of the region by dividing the used fertilizer by the water requirement of that crop per hectare according to the population of each section and the pollution load produced by each person the amount of nitrate intrusion through absorption well is estimated the results of the quality model are presented in table 3 the results indicate that the porosity values are between 26 and 36 and the longitudinal dispersivity coefficients are between 26 and 68 m2 day it is worth noting that the quality model is validated for the same period of the quantitative modeling the obtained results are presented in table 4 comparison of the validation stage results of the quality model shows that the mae and rmse indices are 2 51 and 2 85 mg l respectively small error values in the validation stage indicate the correctness of the results in the calibration stage finally the details of quantitative and qualitative modeling are presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively 3 2 management scenarios definition two possible conditions are considered to assess the future trend of the chadegan aquifer during the next 5 years as follows 1 the current trend considering severe drought conditions first scenario 2 increase in zayandeh roud reservoir storage to the normal operating water level second scenario for the first proposed scenario at first the future precipitation conditions should be estimated in the meteorological drought conditions here standardized precipitation index spi is used to estimate the precipitation regimes mckee et al 1993 using this index the spi 2 00 indicates the extremely dry conditions hayes et al 1999 for this purpose data of rain gauge stations located in the study area with a statistical period of 30 years 1990 2019 are used in recent years due to increase in the downstream water consumption and reduction of water inflow as a result of drought and upstream withdrawals the dam storage is drastically reduced from normal storage of 1250 mcm water level at 2060 m above msl to the lowest 195 6 mcm 2020 m above msl in summer 2020 this matter has consequent effects on the groundwater and reservoir interaction a moderately wet year and controlling the downstream water consumption are assumed therefore it is expected that the storage volume reach up to the normal level the effects of the severe drought conditions and increasing the reservoir water level on the flow direction and quality of the aquifer are estimated by numerical simulation of these two scenarios furthermore three practical managerial scenarios are proposed to improve the quantity and quality conditions of the chadegan aquifer by reducing the water consumption and sources of nitrate pollutants simultaneously these scenarios are presented as follows 1 20 gradual reduction of the agricultural water consumption by increasing the irrigation efficiency and a 20 gradual reduction in nitrate fertilizers consumption during 5 years third scenario 2 20 gradual reduction of the agricultural water consumption and equipping and completing the wastewater collection system during 5 years fourth scenario 3 combining the third and fourth scenarios fifth scenario it should be noted that to reduce the water consumption of agricultural activity various methods can be used including the developing the greenhouse cultivation developing the drip irrigation changing the cultivation pattern and managing the irrigation time in addition to reduce the consumption of nitrogen fertilizers the farmers should be trained for proper fertilization based on the cultivation pattern soil type irrigation type and the region s climate furthermore in this region due to the development of onion cultivation in recent years and the high consumption of nitrogen fertilizers for this product the concentration of this parameter can be reduced by changing the cultivation pattern therefore a reduction of fertilizer consumption and a reduction of about 20 of water use for irrigation 4 results and discussion in this section the obtained results of proposed approaches and scenarios are presented and compared 4 1 quantitative modeling in the chadegan region the obtained results of quantitative modeling show that in most of the wet years the minimum aquifer water level is seen in the september and the maximum level is seen in the april for this aquifer the water level is highly related to precipitation therefore by changing the precipitation in different years the water level of the aquifer changes in the same proportion for this region the maximum water level is 2350 m in the northwestern parts and the minimum water level is 2120 m near the zayandeh roud reservoir in the north part water level contours of the aquifer have a northeast southwest trend and in the center and south parts the trend deviates more to the east west and decreases from the east to the west the results of modeling indicate that the maximum water depth is 55 m located in the east of the aquifer near the maroofabad village the lowest water depth is 20 m in the south and northwest and the average water depth is 33 m the observation data and quantitative simulation of this aquifer reveal that the water level is gradually decreasing during the simulation period the amount of decrease in different parts of the aquifer varies between 3 and 17 m the lowest value occurs near the zayandeh roud reservoir and the highest value occurs near the analoucheh and maroofabad villages in the east 4 2 quantitative modeling in the chadegan region the obtained results of quantitative modeling show that in the south part the nitrate concentration is higher than in the north in the most years as well as this parameter decreases in the spring and summer and increases in the fall and winter the aquifer is highly dependent on the area under cultivation in which the highest value is 66 mg l occurred near the absorption wells the lowest value is 5 mg l in the northwest of the aquifer and the average value is 34 mg l it should be noted that the allowable limit of nitrate concentration value for drinking water is equal to 50 mg l institute of standards and industrial research of iran no 1053 this indicates that although the average concentration of nitrate in this aquifer is less than the allowable limitation however near the wastewater wells it is higher than the allowable value as well as investigating the international standards such as the drinking water standards of canada south korea and australia where the nitrate concentration for drinking water is limited to 10 mg l the nitrate concentration value is unacceptable the obtained results show that in some parts of the region the nitrate concentration values are higher than the allowable limit for drinking furthermore the increasing trend of this value highlights the necessity of using management scenarios to control the nitrate concentration value the obtained results of aquifer water levels in different parts of aquifer indicate a gradual reduction of the nitrate concentration in addition the obtained values of the nitrate concentration show an increasing trend during the simulation period therefore if this trend continues the nitrate concentration values will exceed the allowable limitation these values indicate that in the southern half of the aquifer the nitrate concentration values exceeds the allowable limitation for drinking 50 mg l which may affect the zayandeh roud reservoir in the calibration and validation period the maximum water level drop values in the location of quantitative observation wells the average water level oscillation at the aquifer and the maximum and average nitrate concentration values for the aquifer are 7 75 m 2 49 m 71 mg l and 38 mg l respectively therefore applicable methods should be proposed to prevent the decreasing of water level and increasing the nitrate concentration value in the future in the next section the results of proposed management scenarios to improve the quantitative and qualitative conditions are presented and compared 4 3 management scenarios here two possible conditions in terms of groundwater and reservoir interaction and flow exchange are considered to assess the future trend of the chadegan aquifer during the next 5 years including the effects of the severe drought conditions the increase in reservoir water level in addition three applied management scenarios for the groundwater level and quality of the aquifer are proposed and used by numerical simulation the average water depth and the nitrate concentration values at the end of the forecasted period are presented in table 5 using proposed scenarios the results show that using management scenarios has a minor effect on the average water level and finally water storage volume however the overall quality of the water in the terms of nitrate concentration improves especially by using the fifth scenario in other words average water storage volumes of aquifer are 446 4 mcm 450 96 mcm 450 51 mcm 449 24 mcm and 449 24 mcm using scenario 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively in addition by using fifth scenario the average nitrate concentration value is decreased by 15 25 compared to first scenario furthermore during 1852 days 5 years the numbers of the days with nitrate concentration value above the allowable limitations are 628 604 575 590 and 522 days using scenario 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively it is worth noting that increasing the reservoir water level proposed in the second scenario has a minor effect on the average groundwater level water storage volume and nitrate concentration values finally the water level and nitrate concentration values at the end of the forecasted period for the proposed scenarios are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively the results shows that the patterns of groundwater level variation are almost similar incremental or decreasing in all scenarios and by moving from the northern areas to the southern areas its value decreases in addition the highest nitrate concentration is observed in the central and southern parts of the region and the lowest value is observed in the eastern part the results of fig 8 show that the local concentration at the position of absorption wells is considerably decreased by using scenarios 4 and 5 estimating the water depth and nitrate concentration values of observation wells the percentage values of the difference between the first and the other scenarios are presented in tables 6 and 7 respectively to investigate the impact of the management scenarios on groundwater level and the nitrate concentration values in these tables the positive and the negative values indicate the increasing and decreasing the parameter values respectively furthermore the percentage values of the difference between the second and the other scenarios are presented in tables 8 and 9 respectively to investigate the impact of the management scenarios on groundwater level and the nitrate concentration values by investigating the quantitative modeling for estimating the water level values using different scenarios the following results are obtained 1 investigating the results of tables 6 and 8 the obtained water level values of scenarios 4 and 5 are equal using these two scenarios the gradual reduction of water consumption of agricultural usage and developing the wastewater collection and treatment systems the amount of entrance wastewater of absorption wells reach to zero 2 investigating the results of tables 6 and 8 shows that for wells number 1 2 3 and 4 the rank of scenarios is scenario 3 scenario 4 or scenario 5 scenario 2 and scenario 1 respectively considering the water level values for wells number 5 6 7 8 and 9 the rank is scenario 2 scenario 3 scenario 4 or scenario 5 and scenario 1 respectively comparison of the results shows that only the rank of the scenario 2 changes for different wells this indicates that the scenario 2 affects the water level values in the southern half of the aquifer due to the relatively high slope of the aquifer bedrock 3 the seasonal changes of water level values are high in wells number 2 3 and 4 and they are medium in wells number 5 6 and 8 and finally they are low in wells number 1 7 and 9 it is worth noting that the location of these points for the operation wells and agricultural lands affect the water withdrawal of the aquifer in these areas 4 in all proposed scenarios the trend of water level changes increases in winter and spring and decreases in summer and fall due to recharging the aquifer from precipitation in winter and spring and high water withdrawal in summer and fall 5 investigating the average aquifer water level values at the end of the simulation period and comparing it with the obtained first scenario values presented in table 5 shows that the rank of scenarios are scenario 2 scenario 3 scenario 4 or scenario 5 and scenario 1 respectively by investigating the qualitative modeling for estimating the nitrate concentration values using different scenarios the following results are obtained 1 investigating the results of different proposed scenarios shows that the trend of nitrate concentration changes increases in fall and winter and decreases in spring and summer due to the effect of incorrect use of nitrate fertilizers in spring and summer 2 investigating the results of fig 6 shows that the highest amounts of seasonal changes of nitrate concentration are observed in the well number 12 it is worth noting that the existence of a great number of operation wells and the large area of agricultural lands around this well leads to more seasonal changes in nitrate concentration values 3 the lowest nitrate concentration value is observed in the southern half of the aquifer using the second proposed scenario and it is observed in other areas using the fifth proposed scenario 4 investigating the results of table 9 shows that in some places such as point 3 the amount of nitrate concentration value obtained by using scenarios 3 4 and 5 is more than related values of the first scenario due to the reduction of aquifer recharge from the agricultural return water 5 investigating the average values of aquifer nitrate concentration at the end of the simulation period and comparing it with the results of first scenario presented in table 6 show that the rank of the scenarios is scenario 5 scenario 3 scenario 4 scenario 2 and scenario 1 respectively 5 conclusions in recent years the integrated surface and groundwater numerical quality and quantity modeling have been improved significantly in this article considering the volume of water exchanged between the aquifer and the zayandeh roud reservoir the numerical model of the chadegan aquifer in the central of iran was developed modflow and mt3dms s w were used for modeling the quantitative qualitative interaction of the aquifer and the reservoir the model was calibrated and validated considering steady and unsteady conditions for the period of winter 2011 to the end of winter 2014 and from the beginning of spring 2014 to the end of summer 2020 respectively the results showed a significant decrease of the water level and an increase in the nitrate concentration values in addition in some places the amount of nitrate concentration was more than the allowable limitation for drinking to assess the future trends of the aquifer and to change the current pattern five possible management scenarios were proposed for numerical modeling the management scenarios included a 20 reduction of the groundwater withdrawal a 20 reduction of the fertilizers consumption and gradual improvement of urban wastewater treatment which the last two ones are the main sources of groundwater nitrate contamination the results of the numerical model for predicting the groundwater level during the coming 5 years indicate a 20 reduction of the water withdrawal for irrigation although stopping the declining trend the short terms improvement for aquifer remedial is insignificant in addition increasing the reservoir storage volume to the normal operating water level changed the hydraulic gradient of the exchange flow towards the aquifer and therefore the reservoir would recharge the aquifer this fact led to a significant increase of the water level near the wells while slightly affecting the average values due to the high slope of the aquifer bedrock furthermore the results of the numerical model indicate that a gradual reduction of the consumption of nitrate agricultural fertilizers would significantly improve the aquifer water quality on the other hand the treatment of the wastewater was not very effective for reduction of the aquifer nitrate concentration value however the nitrate concentration value near the wastewater wells significantly decreased locally in addition increasing the reservoir water level to the normal operational level the nitrate concentration value was sharply decreased near the reservoir due to the minor effect of water inflow of the reservoir to the aquifer on the average concentration value declaration of

9122,reliable crop evapotranspiration et forecasting is critical for water resource management and allocation however most estimation models cannot be directly used for et forecasting with public weather forecasting information here we propose a modified priestley taylor pt model using only solar radiation r s and air temperature t a as inputs that can be easily obtained from public weather forecasts the commonly used generalized sunshine and temperature based r s models using forecasted weather types transferred to sunshine duration and t a data as inputs were compared to identify the more suitable model for forecasting daily r s results showed that the modified pt model using measured r s and t a data provided a reasonable accuracy to estimate daily rice et across three energy flux sites the regression coefficient m correlation coefficient r root mean squared error rmse and index of agreement d ia were in the range of 0 949 1 044 0 916 0 964 0 396 0 645 mm d 1 and 0 954 0 980 respectively the generalized temperature based r s model is more suitable for forecasting daily r s for a 1 7 day lead time during the growth period of rice at present as indicated by its superior performance to sunshine based model at 70 of 30 sites the forecasted accuracy of rice et was acceptable and decreased gradually as lead time increased the mean values of m r rmse and d ia were decreased from 0 887 to 0 981 0 641 0 782 1 160 1 243 mm d 1 and 0 783 0 870 in 1 day lead time to 0 834 0 941 0 376 0 563 1 406 1 740 mm d 1 and 0 639 0 743 respectively in 7 day lead time during 2018 2020 at nanjing when r s was forecasted based on the generalized temperature based model this study provides an important approach for short term prediction of rice et using public weather forecasting information keywords generalized temperature based model maximum and minimum temperature modified priestley taylor model paddy rice solar radiation weather types data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rice is an important staple food with a global planting area of over 164 2 million ha in 2020 fao statistics 2022 rice production requires a huge amount of fresh water because of the common cultivation under flooding during most of the growing season which accounts for nearly 34 43 of the global irrigation water irri 2022 however shortage of freshwater resources for agriculture is increasing worldwide threating the sustainable production of rice since rice plants are sensitive to water stress it is important to obtain reliable information of crop water requirement to improve water use efficiency the vast majority of water in farmland is lost by crop evapotranspiration et the et is not only the key component in the water and energy balance cycle but also linked to crop production process it is also the foundational information frequently required for managing water resources and simulating impacts of climate change on crop systems allen et al 2011 therefore reliable and accurate observation and estimation of et at multiple scales receives an increasing attention accurate measurement of et is challenged by high instrument cost and restricted condition for application of each measurement method alternatively many mathematic models have been proposed for estimating et including penman monteith shuttle wallace clumping single or dual crop coefficient and priestley taylor pt models among others allen et al 1998 zhang et al 2008 qiu et al 2015 2022c zhao et al 2015 chen et al 2021 gong et al 2021 qin et al 2023 these models have been well established and successfully applied for estimating et in many plant species using multiple input parameters including measured meteorological data however the required meteorological data in these models are not always readily available on the contrary public weather forecasting information is easily accessible to public through smart phone internet or tv providing data of air temperature t a weather types and wind speed many studies have reported that public weather forecasting can provide reasonable accuracy for t a although there is less accuracy for weather types and wind speed luo et al 2014 yang et al 2019a 2019b if the mathematic estimation model coupled with public weather forecasting data can provide acceptable results then forecasting et will be easily accessible this will facilitate the improvement of water resource management and allocation however most of these mathematical models cannot be directly used for short term et forecasting because they require substantial amounts of input parameters and parameterization among these models the pt model provide a trade off between model complexity and predictive accuracy which is widely used for estimating et for many plant species such as crops pasture and forests ershadi et al 2014 qiu et al 2019 2021a gong et al 2021 the et in the pt model can be calculated by the product of equilibrium evaporation eteq and pt coefficient α pt where variation of daily eteq relies only upon the magnitude of daily net radiation r n and t a however in order to obtain accurate et estimates the α pt in the model needs modifications depending on characteristics of specific crops and management approaches the controlling factors of α pt reported in many studies include t a mulching soil water condition and leaf area index lai fisher et al 2008 ding et al 2013 yao et al 2013 the lai is the only crop related variable in the pt model affecting the partitioning of energy between soil surface and plant canopy however the seasonal variation of lai is highly dynamic for various plants perplexing forecasting on the contrary the fraction of canopy cover f c can be easily predicted with t a data qiu et al 2021a in addition r n is highly related to the global solar radiation r s which can be estimated from t a or sunshine duration can be converted from weather types data as shown elsewhere chen et al 2019 feng et al 2020 qiu et al 2022a moreover rice is submerged during most of growth stages suggesting that there is no need to account for water deficit stress therefore the required variables in the pt model can be reduced to t a and weather types that can be easily obtained from public weather forecasts although the sunshine based r s models are generally superior to the temperature based ones liu et al 2017 feng et al 2020 qiu et al 2022b the forecasted weather types are less accurate than the forecasted t a yang et al 2019a therefore it is necessary to determine the most appropriate model for forecasting r s which is in turn used in the pt model the objective of this study was to establish a modified pt model linking to r s and t a for estimating daily et of rice based on datasets collected from three paddy sites the forecasting performance of daily et of rice at nanjing site was also evaluated with the modified pt model using forecasted r s and t a based on data from 30 cities of major rice production areas in southern china during the period 2015 2016 the forecasted performance of sunshine and temperature based r s models were also compared to identify the best model to be used in the pt model for forecasting rice et 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection 2 1 1 datasets of energy fluxes over paddy rice field in order to evaluate the accuracy of the developed pt model we collected data from three flux sites for paddy rice in asia namely a nanjing site in china 2018 2020 a mase site in japan 2002 2006 and an international rice research institute irri site in the philippines 2013 2014 the datasets from the latter two sites can be freely accessed from the asiaflux website see https db cger nies go jp asiafluxdb page id 16 more information including site crop soil and management characteristics can be found elsewhere qiu et al 2021a thirty min energy fluxes from paddy rice field were determined by using the bowen ratio energy balance method at nanjing site and using the open path eddy covariance system ec at mase and irri sites table 1 summarizes the detailed measurement instruments at the three sites the information of data quality controls and gap filling procedures can be found elsewhere alberto et al 2009 ono et al 2015 qiu et al 2019 2021a the bowen ratio closure method was used to adjust the measured energy fluxes by using the ec at mase and irri sites twine et al 2000 which assumes that the bowen ratio measured by the ec is correct this measured bowen ratio is then adopted to energy closure in addition we measured the dynamic of rice f c at nanjing site during 2016 2020 fig a1 eight photographs of plant canopy were randomly taken every 7 15 days using a ixus 125 hs canon digital camera canon hongkong ltd hongkong which has resolution of 4608 3456 pixels the freeware can eye https www6 paca inrae fr can eye was then deployed for analyzing the collected photographs which can extract the canopy structure characteristics such as leaf area index f c average leaf inclination angle from true color images the f c is the proportion of vegetation pixels in the whole photograph 2 1 2 datasets on public weather forecasts the public weather forecasts data for mase and irri sites were unavailable however we have collected this type of data at nanjing site from the website of weather china http www weather com cn these data included daily maximum and minimum temperature t max and t min c and weather types with a 7 day lead time during the experimental period from 2018 to 2020 in addition we also collected this type of data during april and october covered the growth period of paddy rice from 2015 to 2016 in 30 sites of major rice production areas in southern china the detailed information of these sites were shown in supplemental materials weather types data cannot be directly applied in the proposed model however data can be converted to actual sunshine duration n h cai et al 2007 as 1 n s n where s is the relative duration of sunshine and the values of 0 9 0 7 0 5 0 3 and 0 1 were adopted corresponding to five forecasting weather types i e

datasets for r s estimation in order to derive the generalized coefficients of r s models data were collected from 96 radiation stations in china during the period 1967 2016 the detailed distribution of these radiation stations is shown elsewhere qiu et al 2022b daily meteorological data included r s t max and t min and n strictly quality controlled data were collected from the china meteorological data service centre http data cma cn we used the data of odd years in all stations to derive the generalized coefficients of estimation models for r s and the remaining data for evaluation of models 2 2 the modified pt model for estimating daily et on a daily basis the total surface soil heat flux can be neglected allen et al 1998 hence the pt model for estimating daily et can be modified as 5 λ e t α pt δ δ γ r n where λ is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 α pt is the bulk pt coefficient non dimension δ is the slope vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 which depends on t a as shown elsewhere allen et al 1998 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 which varies with atmospheric pressure and is nearly constant in a given location the et can be partitioned into crop transpiration t mm d 1 and water or soil evaporation e s mm d 1 given as 6 λ t f t α c o δ δ γ r n c 7 λ e s α s o δ δ γ r n s where r nc and r ns are the absorbed energy by the canopy and water or soil surface given as 8 r n c 1 τ r n 9 r n s τ r n where τ is the proportion of radiation transmission reaching the water or soil surface and can be determined based on f c as 10 τ 1 f c β where β is a fitting parameter 1 25 for rice qiu et al 2021a the plant temperature constraint for t non dimension f t can be determined based on a function of t a and optimum temperature for plant growth t g opt as fisher et al 2008 11 f t exp t a t g opt t g opt 2 a t g opt of 27 6 c can be used for oryza sativa sánchez et al 2014 the modified pt coefficients under energy limitation for crop canopy and water or soil α co and α so can be calculated as tanner and jury 1976 12 α s o 1 0 τ τ c α o α o 1 1 τ 1 τ c τ τ c 13 α c o α o α s o τ 1 τ where α o is the reference pt coefficient 1 26 and τ c is set to 0 55 morgan et al 2003 finally the analytical solution of a dynamic α pt can be derived as 14 α pt α s o τ f t α c o 1 τ the input variables in the modified pt model eqs 5 and 14 include r n f c and t a in order to forecast rice et using public weather forecasts mainly reporting t max t min and weather types the r n and f c should be estimated based on t a or weather types data as described hereafter 2 3 estimation of f c based on t a data the development of f c is highly related to the accumulated thermal time att c which can be accumulated based on daily thermal time dtt c d the dtt can be computed depending on daily average t a as follows qiu et al 2021a 15 k t 2 t a t g min α t g opt t g min α t a t g min 2 α t g opt t g min 2 α t g min t a t g max 0 t a t g max o r t a t g min

the wang engle non linear temperature response curve for development rate of phenology wang et al 2017 the f c can be predicted as a modified logistic function as ma and zhou 2013 16 f c a 1 1 exp a 2 a 3 att 10 3 a 4 att 10 3 2 where a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 are the empirical coefficients 1 11 2 84 3 51 and 0 67 respectively based on non linear regression using measured data at nanjing site fig a1 from eq 16 the development of f c is predictable based on measured or predicted t a 2 4 2 5 estimation of daily r n based on t a and or weather type data the daily r n can be determined as allen et al 1998 17

which is 0 25 0 17 and 0 22 respectively for nanjing mase and irri sites the relative humidity rh data are generally not reported in public weather forecasts hence the daily e a required in eq 18 was estimated based on a dynamic adjustment of daily t dew from daily t min qiu et al 2021b as 22 e a e o t dew 0 6108 exp 17 27 t min a t t min a t 237 3 23 a t a 0 ln ai b 0 where a t is the correction

since public weather forecasts provide t a and weather type data we used sunshine and temperature based r s models for forecasting daily r s to determine the most accurate values the following models using only t a or sunshine duration data were adopted considering the extensiveness of use and model accuracy feng et al 2020 qiu et al 2022a 24 r s b 1 t mean b 2 b 3 t max b 4 t min b 5 δ t 2 b 6 t

values of generalized empirical coefficients and corresponding model performance are shown in table 2 2 5 accuracy indicators here we used four statistical indicators to evaluate the goodness of fit i

averages a better performance should have m r and d ia values closer to 1 0 and rmse closer to 0 paredes and pereira 2019 gong et al 2020 3 results 3 1 estimating daily e a based on measured daily t min data in public weather forecasts the rh data are not reported hence daily e a required in eq 18 should be estimated from available t a data fig 1 shows the performance of estimated daily e a based on measured daily t min data the values of m r rmse and d ia were 0 998 0 96 0 22 kpa and 0 98 at nanjing site 0 989 0 96 0 16 kpa and 0 98 at mase site and 1 089 0 62 0 30 kpa and 0 56 respectively at irri site these indicators suggest that the daily e a can be reasonably estimated based on adjustment of daily t dew from daily t min especially for nanjing and mase sites this result agrees with the findings by qiu et al 2021b who reported that this dynamic model for estimating e a provided a reasonable accuracy for various climates from humid to hyper arid the accuracy was lower at irri site than at nanjing and mase sites as a result of continuously hot and wet environment at irri site leading to low variation of daily e a similar results were also reported in other regions in the philippines qiu et al 2021b 3 2 evaluating the modified pt model using measured r s and t a data fig 2 and table 3 show the performance of the modified pt formulation to estimate daily et of rice using measured data of r s and t a in general there is a good agreement between measured and estimated daily et of rice at all sites the values of m ranged from 0 949 to 1 044 suggesting that the daily estimates of rice et are statistically close to the measured values the values of r were 0 916 0 948 0 928 0 964 and 0 936 0 954 for nanjing mase and irri sites respectively showing a strongly linear correlation between measured and estimated daily et of rice the variance of the errors is small with rmse values ranging from 0 396 m to 0 645 mm d 1 and the mean square error is close to the potential as indicated by the higher d ia 0 95 overall the above statistical indicators show that the modified pt model using only r s and t a data is robust and can be widely adopted for predicting daily rice et the performance of predicted daily et of rice then highly depends on the accuracy of forecasted t a and r s as described in the succeeding sections 3 3 forecasting performance of t a and n air temperature is one of the essential factors in the proposed pt model which affects the calculation of δ f t f c e a r s and r nl as earlier described hence the forecasting accuracy of t max and t min is highly related to the predicted performance of et for rice fortunately there was accurate forecasting accuracy for t max and t min for 1 7 day lead time although forecasting performance of t max and t min showed a decreasing trend as lead time increased fig 3 the values of m r rmse and d ia were 0 953 0 996 0 803 0 981 1 035 2 850 c and 0 877 0 990 respectively for t max and 0 970 1 015 0 860 0 967 1 430 2 233 c 0 925 0 983 respectively for t min for the 1 7 day lead time during 2018 2020 at nanjing site in addition the forecasting performance of t a was also stable among different years which will benefit prediction of et of rice with the modified pt model using t a and r s data worldwide it is challenging to accurately forecast weather types at nanjing site the values of m r rmse and d ia to forecast n were within the range of 0 595 0 958 0 253 0 707 2 898 4 546 h and 0 512 0 814 respectively for the 1 7 day lead time during 2018 2020 fig 3 obviously the forecast accuracy of n was worse than those of t max and t min but was acceptable especially for the 1 4 day lead time moreover the forecasted performance of n in 2020 was generally better than that in 2018 and 2019 similar to t max and t min the forecasted accuracy of n also gradually decreased with increasing forecasted lead time 3 4 performance of daily r s forecasted with two types of models solar radiation is a crucial variable affecting prediction of et interestingly although the forecasting accuracy of n is worse than t a the accuracy of the sunshine based r s model is greatly improved compared with that of the temperature based model the mean values of m r rmse and d ia at 96 radiation stations were 0 977 0 936 30 39 w m 2 and 0 961 respectively for the generalized sunshine based r s model and 0 912 0 825 49 65 w m 2 and 0 878 respectively for the generalized temperature based r s model table 2 therefore it is necessary to assess the forecasting performance between generalized temperature and sunshine based r s models the forecasting accuracy of r s decreased gradually as forecasting lead time increased at nanjing site for both the generalized temperature and sunshine based r s models fig 4 the average values of m r rmse and d ia varied from 0 871 to 0 900 0 647 0 810 46 89 54 21 w m 2 and 0 773 0 851 respectively using a 1 day lead time to 0 77 0 87 0 32 0 42 70 65 76 26 w m 2 and 0 58 0 60 respectively using a 7 day lead time for the temperature based model during 2018 2020 likewise they changed from 0 955 to 0 992 0 609 0 737 52 79 57 43 w m 2 and 0 755 0 852 respectively for the 1 day lead time to 0 862 0 936 0 355 0 444 68 46 82 61 w m 2 and 0 633 0 657 respectively for the 7 day lead time for the sunshine based model similar results were also observed in other sites during 2015 and 2016 fig 5 for the different types of r s models the forecasting accuracy of the generalized sunshine based model was slightly higher than that of the generalized temperate based model for a 3 7 day lead time in 2018 2020 at the nanjing site but the opposite phenomenon was observed for a 1 2 day lead time similar results were also observed during april and october in 2015 2016 at nanjing site fig 5 however the generalized temperate based model outperformed the generalized sunshine based model for the 1 7 day lead time at 70 of sites fig 5 indicating that the temperature based model is currently more suitable for forecasting daily r s during the growth period of rice in southern china 3 5 predicting daily et of rice with the forecasted data fig 6 shows the forecasting performance of et with the modified pt model using forecasted r s and t a the forecasting accuracy of r s combined with t max and t min determined the predicted accuracy of et generally the forecasted daily et of rice was acceptable using the modified pt model when r s was predicted based on temperature or sunshine based models and the predicted accuracy decreased gradually as lead time increased the average values of m r and d ia decreased from 0 887 to 0 981 0 641 0 782 and 0 783 0 870 respectively with a 1 day lead time to 0 834 0 941 0 376 0 563 and 0 639 0 743 respectively with a 7 day lead time when r s was estimated based on generalized temperature based model at nanjing site during 2018 2020 the rmse increased correspondingly from 1 160 to 1 243 1 406 1 740 mm d 1 likewise average values of m r rmse and d ia ranged from 0 814 to 0 905 0 596 0 759 1 087 1 303 mm d 1 and 0 729 0 863 respectively with the 1 day lead time to 0 791 0 816 0 371 0 545 1 431 1 740 mm d 1 and 0 636 0 712 respectively with the 7 day lead time when daily r s was predicted based on generalized sunshine based model similar to the forecasted daily r s the forecasting accuracy of daily et of rice in the modified pt model was better when using the generalized sunshine based r s model compared with the generalized temperate based model for the 3 7 day lead time in 2018 2020 at nanjing site a pattern that reversed with the 1 2 day lead time fig 6 4 discussion and conclusions the pt model is a well known and widely adopted energy driven model which provides a trade off between model complexity and predictive ability many studies have shown that the pt model after adjusting α pt can accurately estimate et in various plant species including rice winter wheat cotton tomato maize pasture needle and broadleaf forests and savanna sumner and jacobs 2005 fisher et al 2008 ding et al 2013 yao et al 2013 ershadi et al 2014 ai and yang 2016 qiu et al 2019 gong et al 2021 in these studies a combination of bio physiological constraints such as plant and soil water constraints relative surface wetness f t and fraction of mulching was used to modify α pt based on characteristics of different crops and management methods here the plant temperature constraint was accommodated for rice which can be well expressed by functions of t a in addition the energy received by crop canopy and water or soil surface here has been successfully expressed as a function of f c where development of f c can be well captured by a function of att this makes it possible to predict et based on t a data because f c is the only crop related variable required in the pt model furthermore the daily r n can be easily estimated based on daily r s which can be estimated based on sunshine or temperature based models using only n or t a data the daily e a data used to estimate r n can be also well estimated from daily t min qiu et al 2021b therefore the input variables of the proposed pt model were reduced to only daily t a and n which is routinely reported in weather forecasts overall the results indicate that the modified pt model using only measured t a and r s data is accurate for estimating daily et of rice at multiple sites table 3 and fig 2 hence the forecasting performance is depending on the forecasted t a and r s the weather forecasts can well capture the daily t max and t min as shown in fig 3 similar results were also reported for other cities in china for instance the values of rmse and r ranged from 2 52 to 5 03 c and 0 88 0 97 for t max and from 1 24 to 4 76 c and 0 95 0 99 for t min for lead times of 1 7 days at harbin khotan yinchuan kaifeng wuhan guilin ganyu and fuzhou cities during 2012 2014 yang et al 2019a when assessing the forecasted performance for 61 cities distributed in varying climate zones of china yang et al 2019b also indicated the forecasted accuracy of t max and t min was reasonable for the 1 7 days lead time during 2012 2016 this also shows that the t a can be widely well forecasted however the accuracy of forecasted n is much lower than that of t a at present which may be attributed to the comparatively low forecasting accuracy of weather type and translating method from the weather type into n yang et al 2016 2019b this also means that it has a great potential for improvement of forecasted n the forecasting performance of t a and n therefore greatly affected daily r s predictions based on the generalized temperate and sunshine based models although many studies have shown the superiority of sunshine based model to the temperature based model for estimating daily r s liu et al 2017 fan et al 2018 feng et al 2020 as is the case here table 2 the lower forecasted accuracy of n than t a produced a large uncertainty in sunshine based model for forecasting daily r s the results here showed that under the current accuracy of weather forecasting the generalized sunshine based model produced less accuracy for the 1 7 day lead time in 2015 2016 relative to the generalized temperature based model for 70 of total sites fig 5 however since temperature based r s models are difficult to revolutionarily improve their estimation accuracy to surpass sunshine based models we recommend sunshine based r s models as a more promising method to forecast daily r s as the improved accuracy of weather forecasting in future especially for the forecasts of more refined weather types to better apply the proposed method to local farms we also recommend measuring the local meteorological conditions including r s and t a to establish the local calibrated sunshine or temperature based rs models for forecasting et which is shown providing better accuracy than the generalized sunshine or temperature based models qiu et al

9122,reliable crop evapotranspiration et forecasting is critical for water resource management and allocation however most estimation models cannot be directly used for et forecasting with public weather forecasting information here we propose a modified priestley taylor pt model using only solar radiation r s and air temperature t a as inputs that can be easily obtained from public weather forecasts the commonly used generalized sunshine and temperature based r s models using forecasted weather types transferred to sunshine duration and t a data as inputs were compared to identify the more suitable model for forecasting daily r s results showed that the modified pt model using measured r s and t a data provided a reasonable accuracy to estimate daily rice et across three energy flux sites the regression coefficient m correlation coefficient r root mean squared error rmse and index of agreement d ia were in the range of 0 949 1 044 0 916 0 964 0 396 0 645 mm d 1 and 0 954 0 980 respectively the generalized temperature based r s model is more suitable for forecasting daily r s for a 1 7 day lead time during the growth period of rice at present as indicated by its superior performance to sunshine based model at 70 of 30 sites the forecasted accuracy of rice et was acceptable and decreased gradually as lead time increased the mean values of m r rmse and d ia were decreased from 0 887 to 0 981 0 641 0 782 1 160 1 243 mm d 1 and 0 783 0 870 in 1 day lead time to 0 834 0 941 0 376 0 563 1 406 1 740 mm d 1 and 0 639 0 743 respectively in 7 day lead time during 2018 2020 at nanjing when r s was forecasted based on the generalized temperature based model this study provides an important approach for short term prediction of rice et using public weather forecasting information keywords generalized temperature based model maximum and minimum temperature modified priestley taylor model paddy rice solar radiation weather types data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rice is an important staple food with a global planting area of over 164 2 million ha in 2020 fao statistics 2022 rice production requires a huge amount of fresh water because of the common cultivation under flooding during most of the growing season which accounts for nearly 34 43 of the global irrigation water irri 2022 however shortage of freshwater resources for agriculture is increasing worldwide threating the sustainable production of rice since rice plants are sensitive to water stress it is important to obtain reliable information of crop water requirement to improve water use efficiency the vast majority of water in farmland is lost by crop evapotranspiration et the et is not only the key component in the water and energy balance cycle but also linked to crop production process it is also the foundational information frequently required for managing water resources and simulating impacts of climate change on crop systems allen et al 2011 therefore reliable and accurate observation and estimation of et at multiple scales receives an increasing attention accurate measurement of et is challenged by high instrument cost and restricted condition for application of each measurement method alternatively many mathematic models have been proposed for estimating et including penman monteith shuttle wallace clumping single or dual crop coefficient and priestley taylor pt models among others allen et al 1998 zhang et al 2008 qiu et al 2015 2022c zhao et al 2015 chen et al 2021 gong et al 2021 qin et al 2023 these models have been well established and successfully applied for estimating et in many plant species using multiple input parameters including measured meteorological data however the required meteorological data in these models are not always readily available on the contrary public weather forecasting information is easily accessible to public through smart phone internet or tv providing data of air temperature t a weather types and wind speed many studies have reported that public weather forecasting can provide reasonable accuracy for t a although there is less accuracy for weather types and wind speed luo et al 2014 yang et al 2019a 2019b if the mathematic estimation model coupled with public weather forecasting data can provide acceptable results then forecasting et will be easily accessible this will facilitate the improvement of water resource management and allocation however most of these mathematical models cannot be directly used for short term et forecasting because they require substantial amounts of input parameters and parameterization among these models the pt model provide a trade off between model complexity and predictive accuracy which is widely used for estimating et for many plant species such as crops pasture and forests ershadi et al 2014 qiu et al 2019 2021a gong et al 2021 the et in the pt model can be calculated by the product of equilibrium evaporation eteq and pt coefficient α pt where variation of daily eteq relies only upon the magnitude of daily net radiation r n and t a however in order to obtain accurate et estimates the α pt in the model needs modifications depending on characteristics of specific crops and management approaches the controlling factors of α pt reported in many studies include t a mulching soil water condition and leaf area index lai fisher et al 2008 ding et al 2013 yao et al 2013 the lai is the only crop related variable in the pt model affecting the partitioning of energy between soil surface and plant canopy however the seasonal variation of lai is highly dynamic for various plants perplexing forecasting on the contrary the fraction of canopy cover f c can be easily predicted with t a data qiu et al 2021a in addition r n is highly related to the global solar radiation r s which can be estimated from t a or sunshine duration can be converted from weather types data as shown elsewhere chen et al 2019 feng et al 2020 qiu et al 2022a moreover rice is submerged during most of growth stages suggesting that there is no need to account for water deficit stress therefore the required variables in the pt model can be reduced to t a and weather types that can be easily obtained from public weather forecasts although the sunshine based r s models are generally superior to the temperature based ones liu et al 2017 feng et al 2020 qiu et al 2022b the forecasted weather types are less accurate than the forecasted t a yang et al 2019a therefore it is necessary to determine the most appropriate model for forecasting r s which is in turn used in the pt model the objective of this study was to establish a modified pt model linking to r s and t a for estimating daily et of rice based on datasets collected from three paddy sites the forecasting performance of daily et of rice at nanjing site was also evaluated with the modified pt model using forecasted r s and t a based on data from 30 cities of major rice production areas in southern china during the period 2015 2016 the forecasted performance of sunshine and temperature based r s models were also compared to identify the best model to be used in the pt model for forecasting rice et 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection 2 1 1 datasets of energy fluxes over paddy rice field in order to evaluate the accuracy of the developed pt model we collected data from three flux sites for paddy rice in asia namely a nanjing site in china 2018 2020 a mase site in japan 2002 2006 and an international rice research institute irri site in the philippines 2013 2014 the datasets from the latter two sites can be freely accessed from the asiaflux website see https db cger nies go jp asiafluxdb page id 16 more information including site crop soil and management characteristics can be found elsewhere qiu et al 2021a thirty min energy fluxes from paddy rice field were determined by using the bowen ratio energy balance method at nanjing site and using the open path eddy covariance system ec at mase and irri sites table 1 summarizes the detailed measurement instruments at the three sites the information of data quality controls and gap filling procedures can be found elsewhere alberto et al 2009 ono et al 2015 qiu et al 2019 2021a the bowen ratio closure method was used to adjust the measured energy fluxes by using the ec at mase and irri sites twine et al 2000 which assumes that the bowen ratio measured by the ec is correct this measured bowen ratio is then adopted to energy closure in addition we measured the dynamic of rice f c at nanjing site during 2016 2020 fig a1 eight photographs of plant canopy were randomly taken every 7 15 days using a ixus 125 hs canon digital camera canon hongkong ltd hongkong which has resolution of 4608 3456 pixels the freeware can eye https www6 paca inrae fr can eye was then deployed for analyzing the collected photographs which can extract the canopy structure characteristics such as leaf area index f c average leaf inclination angle from true color images the f c is the proportion of vegetation pixels in the whole photograph 2 1 2 datasets on public weather forecasts the public weather forecasts data for mase and irri sites were unavailable however we have collected this type of data at nanjing site from the website of weather china http www weather com cn these data included daily maximum and minimum temperature t max and t min c and weather types with a 7 day lead time during the experimental period from 2018 to 2020 in addition we also collected this type of data during april and october covered the growth period of paddy rice from 2015 to 2016 in 30 sites of major rice production areas in southern china the detailed information of these sites were shown in supplemental materials weather types data cannot be directly applied in the proposed model however data can be converted to actual sunshine duration n h cai et al 2007 as 1 n s n where s is the relative duration of sunshine and the values of 0 9 0 7 0 5 0 3 and 0 1 were adopted corresponding to five forecasting weather types i e

datasets for r s estimation in order to derive the generalized coefficients of r s models data were collected from 96 radiation stations in china during the period 1967 2016 the detailed distribution of these radiation stations is shown elsewhere qiu et al 2022b daily meteorological data included r s t max and t min and n strictly quality controlled data were collected from the china meteorological data service centre http data cma cn we used the data of odd years in all stations to derive the generalized coefficients of estimation models for r s and the remaining data for evaluation of models 2 2 the modified pt model for estimating daily et on a daily basis the total surface soil heat flux can be neglected allen et al 1998 hence the pt model for estimating daily et can be modified as 5 λ e t α pt δ δ γ r n where λ is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 α pt is the bulk pt coefficient non dimension δ is the slope vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 which depends on t a as shown elsewhere allen et al 1998 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 which varies with atmospheric pressure and is nearly constant in a given location the et can be partitioned into crop transpiration t mm d 1 and water or soil evaporation e s mm d 1 given as 6 λ t f t α c o δ δ γ r n c 7 λ e s α s o δ δ γ r n s where r nc and r ns are the absorbed energy by the canopy and water or soil surface given as 8 r n c 1 τ r n 9 r n s τ r n where τ is the proportion of radiation transmission reaching the water or soil surface and can be determined based on f c as 10 τ 1 f c β where β is a fitting parameter 1 25 for rice qiu et al 2021a the plant temperature constraint for t non dimension f t can be determined based on a function of t a and optimum temperature for plant growth t g opt as fisher et al 2008 11 f t exp t a t g opt t g opt 2 a t g opt of 27 6 c can be used for oryza sativa sánchez et al 2014 the modified pt coefficients under energy limitation for crop canopy and water or soil α co and α so can be calculated as tanner and jury 1976 12 α s o 1 0 τ τ c α o α o 1 1 τ 1 τ c τ τ c 13 α c o α o α s o τ 1 τ where α o is the reference pt coefficient 1 26 and τ c is set to 0 55 morgan et al 2003 finally the analytical solution of a dynamic α pt can be derived as 14 α pt α s o τ f t α c o 1 τ the input variables in the modified pt model eqs 5 and 14 include r n f c and t a in order to forecast rice et using public weather forecasts mainly reporting t max t min and weather types the r n and f c should be estimated based on t a or weather types data as described hereafter 2 3 estimation of f c based on t a data the development of f c is highly related to the accumulated thermal time att c which can be accumulated based on daily thermal time dtt c d the dtt can be computed depending on daily average t a as follows qiu et al 2021a 15 k t 2 t a t g min α t g opt t g min α t a t g min 2 α t g opt t g min 2 α t g min t a t g max 0 t a t g max o r t a t g min

the wang engle non linear temperature response curve for development rate of phenology wang et al 2017 the f c can be predicted as a modified logistic function as ma and zhou 2013 16 f c a 1 1 exp a 2

16 the development of f c is predictable based on measured or predicted t a 2 4 2 5 estimation of daily r n based on t a and or weather type data the daily r n can be determined as allen et al 1998 17

which is 0 25 0 17 and 0 22 respectively for nanjing mase and irri sites the relative humidity rh data are generally not reported in public weather forecasts hence the daily e a required in eq 18 was estimated based on a dynamic adjustment of daily t dew from daily t min qiu et al 2021b as 22 e a e o t dew 0 6108 exp 17 27 t min a t t min a t 237 3 23 a t a 0 ln ai b 0 where a t is the correction

since public weather forecasts provide t a and weather type data we used sunshine and temperature based r s models for forecasting daily r s to determine the most accurate values the following models using only t a or sunshine duration data were adopted considering the extensiveness of use and model accuracy feng et al 2020 qiu et al 2022a 24 r s b 1 t mean b 2 b 3 t max b 4 t min b 5 δ t 2 b 6 t

values of generalized empirical coefficients and corresponding model performance are shown in table 2 2 5 accuracy indicators here we used four statistical indicators to evaluate the goodness of fit i

min data in public weather forecasts the rh data are not reported hence daily e a required in eq 18 should be estimated from available t a data fig 1 shows the performance of estimated daily e a based on measured daily t min data the values of m r rmse and d ia were 0 998 0 96 0 22 kpa and 0 98 at nanjing site 0 989 0 96 0 16 kpa and 0 98 at mase site and 1 089 0 62 0 30 kpa and 0 56 respectively at irri site these indicators suggest that the daily e a can be reasonably estimated based on adjustment of daily t dew from daily t min especially for nanjing and mase sites this result agrees with the findings by qiu et al 2021b who reported that this dynamic model for estimating e a provided a reasonable accuracy for various climates from humid to hyper arid the accuracy was lower at irri site than at nanjing and mase sites as a result of continuously hot and wet environment at irri site leading to low variation of daily e a similar results were also reported in other regions in the philippines qiu et al 2021b 3 2 evaluating the modified pt model using measured r s and t a data fig 2 and table 3 show the performance of the modified pt formulation to estimate daily et of rice using measured data of r s and t a in general there is a good agreement between measured and estimated daily et of rice at all sites the values of m ranged from 0 949 to 1 044 suggesting that the daily estimates of rice et are statistically close to the measured values the values of r were 0 916 0 948 0 928 0 964 and 0 936 0 954 for nanjing mase and irri sites respectively showing a strongly linear correlation between measured and estimated daily et of rice the variance of the errors is small with rmse values ranging from 0 396 m to 0 645 mm d 1 and the mean square error is close to the potential as indicated by the higher d ia 0 95 overall the above statistical indicators show that the modified pt model using only r s and t a data is robust and can be widely adopted for predicting daily rice et the performance of predicted daily et of rice then highly depends on the accuracy of forecasted t a and r s as described in the succeeding sections 3 3 forecasting performance of t a and n air temperature is one of the essential factors in the proposed pt model which affects the calculation of δ f t f c e a r s and r nl as earlier described hence the forecasting accuracy of t max and t min is highly related to the predicted performance of et for rice fortunately there was accurate forecasting accuracy for t max and t min for 1 7 day lead time although forecasting performance of t max and t min showed a decreasing trend as lead time increased fig 3 the values of m r rmse and d ia were 0 953 0 996 0 803 0 981 1 035 2 850 c and 0 877 0 990 respectively for t max and 0 970 1 015 0 860 0 967 1 430 2 233 c 0 925 0 983 respectively for t min for the 1 7 day lead time during 2018 2020 at nanjing site in addition the forecasting performance of t a was also stable among different years which will benefit prediction of et of rice with the modified pt model using t a and r s data worldwide it is challenging to accurately forecast weather types at nanjing site the values of m r rmse and d ia to forecast n were within the range of 0 595 0 958 0 253 0 707 2 898 4 546 h and 0 512 0 814 respectively for the 1 7 day lead time during 2018 2020 fig 3 obviously the forecast accuracy of n was worse than those of t max and t min but was acceptable especially for the 1 4 day lead time moreover the forecasted performance of n in 2020 was generally better than that in 2018 and 2019 similar to t max and t min the forecasted accuracy of n also gradually decreased with increasing forecasted lead time 3 4 performance of daily r s forecasted with two types of models solar radiation is a crucial variable affecting prediction of et interestingly although the forecasting accuracy of n is worse than t a the accuracy of the sunshine based r s model is greatly improved compared with that of the temperature based model the mean values of m r rmse and d ia at 96 radiation stations were 0 977 0 936 30 39 w m 2 and 0 961 respectively for the generalized sunshine based r s model and 0 912 0 825 49 65 w m 2 and 0 878 respectively for the generalized temperature based r s model table 2 therefore it is necessary to assess the forecasting performance between generalized temperature and sunshine based r s models the forecasting accuracy of r s decreased gradually as forecasting lead time increased at nanjing site for both the generalized temperature and sunshine based r s models fig 4 the average values of m r rmse and d ia varied from 0 871 to 0 900 0 647 0 810 46 89 54 21 w m 2 and 0 773 0 851 respectively using a 1 day lead time to 0 77 0 87 0 32 0 42 70 65 76 26 w m 2 and 0 58 0 60 respectively using a 7 day lead time for the temperature based model during 2018 2020 likewise they changed from 0 955 to 0 992 0 609 0 737 52 79 57 43 w m 2 and 0 755 0 852 respectively for the 1 day lead time to 0 862 0 936 0 355 0 444 68 46 82 61 w m 2 and 0 633 0 657 respectively for the 7 day lead time for the sunshine based model similar results were also observed in other sites during 2015 and 2016 fig 5 for the different types of r s models the forecasting accuracy of the generalized sunshine based model was slightly higher than that of the generalized temperate based model for a 3 7 day lead time in 2018 2020 at the nanjing site but the opposite phenomenon was observed for a 1 2 day lead time similar results were also observed during april and october in 2015 2016 at nanjing site fig 5 however the generalized temperate based model outperformed the generalized sunshine based model for the 1 7 day lead time at 70 of sites fig 5 indicating that the temperature based model is currently more suitable for forecasting daily r s during the growth period of rice in southern china 3 5 predicting daily et of rice with the forecasted data fig 6 shows the forecasting performance of et with the modified pt model using forecasted r s and t a the forecasting accuracy of r s combined with t max and t min determined the predicted accuracy of et generally the forecasted daily et of rice was acceptable using the modified pt model when r s was predicted based on temperature or sunshine based models and the predicted accuracy decreased gradually as lead time increased the average values of m r and d ia decreased from 0 887 to 0 981 0 641 0 782 and 0 783 0 870 respectively with a 1 day lead time to 0 834 0 941 0 376 0 563 and 0 639 0 743 respectively with a 7 day lead time when r s was estimated based on generalized temperature based model at nanjing site during 2018 2020 the rmse increased correspondingly from 1 160 to 1 243 1 406 1 740 mm d 1 likewise average values of m r rmse and d ia ranged from 0 814 to 0 905 0 596 0 759 1 087 1 303 mm d 1 and 0 729 0 863 respectively with the 1 day lead time to 0 791 0 816 0 371 0 545 1 431 1 740 mm d 1 and 0 636 0 712 respectively with the 7 day lead time when daily r s was predicted based on generalized sunshine based model similar to the forecasted daily r s the forecasting accuracy of daily et of rice in the modified pt model was better when using the generalized sunshine based r s model compared with the generalized temperate based model for the 3 7 day lead time in 2018 2020 at nanjing site a pattern that reversed with the 1 2 day lead time fig 6 4 discussion and conclusions the pt model is a well known and widely adopted energy driven model which provides a trade off between model complexity and predictive ability many studies have shown that the pt model after adjusting α pt can accurately estimate et in various plant species including rice winter wheat cotton tomato maize pasture needle and broadleaf forests and savanna sumner and jacobs 2005 fisher et al 2008 ding et al 2013 yao et al 2013 ershadi et al 2014 ai and yang 2016 qiu et al 2019 gong et al 2021 in these studies a combination of bio physiological constraints such as plant and soil water constraints relative surface wetness f t and fraction of mulching was used to modify α pt based on characteristics of different crops and management methods here the plant temperature constraint was accommodated for rice which can be well expressed by functions of t a in addition the energy received by crop canopy and water or soil surface here has been successfully expressed as a function of f c where development of f c can be well captured by a function of att this makes it possible to predict et based on t a data because f c is the only crop related variable required in the pt model furthermore the daily r n can be easily estimated based on daily r s which can be estimated based on sunshine or temperature based models using only n or t a data the daily e a data used to estimate r n can be also well estimated from daily t min qiu et al 2021b therefore the input variables of the proposed pt model were reduced to only daily t a and n which is routinely reported in weather forecasts overall the results indicate that the modified pt model using only measured t a and r s data is accurate for estimating daily et of rice at multiple sites table 3 and fig 2 hence the forecasting performance is depending on the forecasted t a and r s the weather forecasts can well capture the daily t max and t min as shown in fig 3 similar results were also reported for other cities in china for instance the values of rmse and r ranged from 2 52 to 5 03 c and 0 88 0 97 for t max and from 1 24 to 4 76 c and 0 95 0 99 for t min for lead times of 1 7 days at harbin khotan yinchuan kaifeng wuhan guilin ganyu and fuzhou cities during 2012 2014 yang et al 2019a when assessing the forecasted performance for 61 cities distributed in varying climate zones of china yang et al 2019b also indicated the forecasted accuracy of t max and t min was reasonable for the 1 7 days lead time during 2012 2016 this also shows that the t a can be widely well forecasted however the accuracy of forecasted n is much lower than that of t a at present which may be attributed to the comparatively low forecasting accuracy of weather type and translating method from the weather type into n yang et al 2016 2019b this also means that it has a great potential for improvement of forecasted n the forecasting performance of t a and n therefore greatly affected daily r s predictions based on the generalized temperate and sunshine based models although many studies have shown the superiority of sunshine based model to the temperature based model for estimating daily r s liu et al 2017 fan et al 2018 feng et al 2020 as is the case here table 2 the lower forecasted accuracy of n than t a produced a large uncertainty in sunshine based model for forecasting daily r s the results here showed that under the current accuracy of weather forecasting the generalized sunshine based model produced less accuracy for the 1 7 day lead time in 2015 2016 relative to the generalized temperature based model for 70 of total sites fig 5 however since temperature based r s models are difficult to revolutionarily improve their estimation accuracy to surpass sunshine based models we recommend sunshine based r s models as a more promising method to forecast daily r s as the improved accuracy of weather forecasting in future especially for the forecasts of more refined weather types to better apply the proposed method to local farms we also recommend measuring the local meteorological conditions including r s and t a to establish the local calibrated sunshine or temperature based rs models for forecasting et which is shown providing better accuracy than the generalized sunshine or temperature based models qiu et al

9123,limited information is available on the impact of deliberate selfing compared with open pollination and its interaction with water deficit on productivity and phytochemical constituents of essential oil in fennel foeniculum vulgare mill and also the genetic analysis of traits during this research 21 selfed s1 and 42 open pollinated op progenies of fennel developed in 2017 18 were evaluated in the field under well watered and water deficit conditions in two years 2019 and 2020 for phytochemical and productivity traits gc ms analysis revealed that among the eight different compounds in the essential oil trans anethole fenchone estragole and limonene were found to be the main constituents water deficit greatly decreased grain yield and essential oil content α pinene trans anethole and anisaldehyde while significantly increased β myrcene limonene γ terpinene fenchone and estragole in both populations compared with open pollination selfing reduced the mean performance of seed and essential oil yield β myrcene and limonene under normal and water deficit conditions and α pinene under normal condition demonstrating the effects of inbreeding on these traits the relationship between γ terpinene and anisaldehyde was positive in the s1 population while in the op population there was significant and negative association between these two constituents the genetic analysis of traits indicated that additive gene action played an important role in controlling most of the traits but that both additive and non additive gene effects played a role in the genetic control of grain yield indicating that selection based on an index may be more useful for improvement of grain yield in recurrent selection programs abbreviations aneth trans anethole anis

introduction fennel foeniculum vulgare mill a medicinal and aromatic plant belonging to the apiaceae family is an annual biennial or perennial herb pavela et al 2016 it is considered native indigenous to southern europe and the mediterranean area gross et al 2009 but has been domesticated and introduced into many regions outside that zone zoubiri et al 2014 it is grown for production of essential oil or is used as herb throughout the world the essential oil content of fennel is about 2 4 which is used as flavoring agents in food products such as beverages bread pickles pastries and cheese shahat et al 2011 the main constituents of essential oil in fennel are trans anethole estragole fenchone and limonene cosge et al 2008 the composition of essential oil is determined by different factors such as species variety and environment rebey et al 2012 however many factors such as soil conditions soil water levels nemeth zambori et al 2016 quality and intensity of light souza et al 2016 noguchi and amaki 2016 and different pollination and reproductive systems figueiredo et al 2008 could limit the production of essential oil and other compounds of medicinal plants drought is a primary abiotic constraint affecting the growth survival and productivity of plants in arid and semi arid regions of the world ciais et al 2005 and will become more frequent and severe with climate change and deficiencies of fresh water caused by population growth ipcc 2014 it leads to biochemical disorders and can change plant behavior regarding the biosynthesis of primary and secondary metabolites rebey et al 2012 in addition drought influences essential oil biosynthesis and therefore affects the composition of essential oil laribi et al 2009 therefore there is an increasing need for plant species or genotypes that can grow under water limited situations affordable and reliable selection indices such as the stress tolerance index sti and yield stability index ysi which provide a measure of stress tolerance based on performance under stress and non stress conditions have been recommended for screening drought tolerant genotypes phenotyping based on these indices along with agronomic and phytochemical traits may facilitate the identification of preferable and effective traits which accelerate the improvement of yield potential and performance under drought stress condition the reproductive system of medicinal plants has been investigated to provide a basis for the genetic improvement of essential oil and secondary metabolites richardson et al 2016 the development of self pollinated plants has an important role in the improvement of medicinal plants populations through fixing some traits the most important problem in self pollinating is inbreeding depression which commonly occurs in outcrossing species when they are enforced to be self pollinated inbreeding is defined as the mating of closely related individuals and the reduction in the fitness of inbred progenies compared with the offspring from unrelated parents is called inbreeding depression henter 2003 the magnitude and specific effects of inbreeding are dependent on the genetic structure of the species or population and the genotype environment interaction and therefore are highly variable hedrick and kalinowski 2000 however selfing does not always lead to negative effects on plants it facilitates the development of inbred lines which is important for the construction of special populations for genetic studies considering the importance of fennel as a vegetable and medicinal herb current information about the breeding of important fitness traits under selfing and open pollination is limited in this species the success of breeding programs requires information on the extent and nature of genetic variability heritability and association among different traits half sib hs mating such as open pollination and polycross is widely used to estimate genetic parameters in quantitative genetic studies araujo et al 2002 since the genetic variance among hs families is equal to one fourth of the additive genetic variance assuming there is no additive x additive types of epistatic variance estimation of heritability based on the analysis of hs families gives a good prediction of narrow sense heritability kearsey and pooni 1996 although the chemical constituents of the seed essential oil of fennel are well studied abou el nasr et al 2013 zheljazkov et al 2013 figueredo et al 2016 there is a lack of information regarding the effects of inbreeding depression compared with open pollination water deficit condition compared with normal and their interactions on the essential oil and its phytochemical constituents of fennel genotypes moreover despite the large number of studies conducted on different characteristics of fennel limited information is available on the genetic analysis of essential oil content and its phytochemical constitutes therefore this study was conducted to i determine and compare the content and constituents of seed essential oil among lines derived from two genetic populations of fennel selfed and half sib progenies under normal and water deficit conditions ii assess the inheritance and genetic basis of the mentioned traits as well as the effect of water deficit on genetic variation and inheritance of traits and iii demonstrate the first generation consequences of inbreeding and outbreeding for offspring fitness under normal and water deficit conditions and selecting superior genotypes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this research was conducted in the research farm of the isfahan university of technology isfahan iran 32 30 n 51 20 e 1630 m amsl in 2019 and 2020 this region had a typic haplargid silty clay loam soil with ph 8 3 and is characterized by annual precipitation of 140 mm and mean annual temperature of 14 5 c in this region summers are dry usually with no rain from late may to mid october therefore supplemental irrigation is needed for growing crops during this period 2 2 plant materials in this study 42 op and 21 s1 families were constructed from open and self pollination of 50 parental ecotypes of fennel during 2016 and 2017 and used as the genetic material the parental plants were mainly consisted of natural ecotypes of fennel from wide geographical areas of iran plus some foreign ecotypes which were kindly provided by the leibniz institute of plant genetics and crop plant research ipk table 1 the parental genotypes were grown in the field in a randomized complete block design with four replications in march 2015 in each plot plants were cultivated in two 4 m long rows 50 cm row spacing and a within row spacing of 40 cm and evaluated for four years from 2015 to 2018 table 1 during these four years irrigation was conducted with no limitation and applied when 50 of the soil available water was exhausted from the root zone in 2016 and 2017 50 of newly emerged umbels on each plant were isolated in paper bags before anthesis to enforce self pollination and the second half in the same plant were left uncovered to be open pollinated the bags were handmade light transparent oiled paper bags proportional to the length of inflorescences at the complete maturity stage the seeds of the plants were harvested separately from the selfed and the open pollinated panicles at the end of the summer then seeds of each family for the two harvest years were bulked to have enough seeds for the progeny field evaluation from the 50 parental ecotypes 42 ecotypes produced enough op seeds and 21 ecotypes produced enough s1 seeds consequently two populations that is 21 selfed progenies s1 and 42 open pollinated op progenies families of half sibs were developed as the genetic material for this study table 1 on first march 2018 the seeds of each s1 and op populations were grown in the field and were evaluated during 2018 2020 using a split plot experiment according to a randomized complete block design with four repetitions each plot contained four rows of 3 m length in which plants were grown with the intervals of 50 cm between rows and 40 cm between plants within row 2 3 applying water deficit and field evaluations plants were grown under normal condition during 2018 for complete establishment after establishment the families were evaluated under two moisture conditions of normal and water deficit during 2019 and 2020 under normal and water deficit conditions water was supplied when 50 and 90 of the plant available water paw was exhausted from the root zone respectively which was calculated according to allen et al 1998 as paw θfc θpwp where θfc is the soil gravimetric moisture percentage at the field capacity and θpwp is the soil gravimetric moisture percentage at the wilting point in each year of the experiment water deficit was alternatively applied during the growing season from first of may to the first of october to determine the amount of irrigation water and detect the irrigation times soil samples were taken from different sites of each moisture condition at the depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm using a hand auger and the gravimetric soil water content was measured clarke topp et al 2008 at the irrigation time the irrigation depth was determined according to the following equation i θfc θirri 100 d b where i is the irrigation depth cm θfc is the soil gravimetric moisture percentage at the field capacity θirri is the soil gravimetric moisture percentage at the irrigation time d is the root zone depth and b is the soil bulk density at root zone 1 4 g cm 3 water was delivered to the field using a drip irrigation system through a pumping station polyethylene pipes and drip tapes a volumetric counter was used to measure the water volume applied under each moisture condition during the plant establishment year 2018 no data were recorded traits were recorded during the growing seasons of 2019 and 2020 the agro morphological and phytochemical traits that were evaluated under two levels of irrigation normal and water deficit included seed yield per plant syp g plant seed essential oil content eoc and phytochemical constitutes of essential oil seed yield per plant was measured based on 10 randomly selected samples of each family and the mean value of these 10 plants was calculated and used for analyses essential oil content and phytochemical constitutes of essential oil were measured as percent using 50 g of seeds of each family inbreeding depression id for each trait was calculated using the following formula id mop ms mop 100 where mop is the mean value of the open pollinated population and ms is the mean value of the self pollinated population to differentiate the drought tolerant and susceptible families two drought tolerance and susceptibility indices were calculated separately for seed yield and essential oil yield stress tolerance index sti fernandez 1992 which can be used to identify families that produce high yields under both normal and water deficit conditions and yield stability index ysi bouslama and schapaugh 1984 which is the ratio of yield under water deficit to the yield under normal condition were calculated according to the following formulations sti ypi ysi ymp 2 ysi ysi ypi where ysi is the seed yield and essential oil yield of a given family grown under water deficit ypi designates that of a given family grown under normal condition and yms is the seed yield and essential oil yield mean over all families grown under water deficit 2 4 essential oil extraction extraction of essential oil was conducted by hydrodistillation of dried ripe seeds previously dried for 24 h at 70 c of each fennel family for 3 h zheljazkov et al 2013 using a clevenger type apparatus for this purpose dried seeds of each family were ground into fine powder using an electric grinder and then 50 g of powdered seeds were placed in a round bottom flask distillates of essential oils were subsequently collected using diethyl ether v v filtered stored in the sealed glass vials and kept in 4 c until gc ms analyses the essential oil content was determined based on the weight of the dry seeds using the following equation essential oil content eoc weight of eo recovered g weight of seed g 100 essential oil yield eoy g plant was calculated from multiplication of seed yield per plant with essential oil content for each family abou el nasr et al 2013 2 5 gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analyses gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis with the agilent technologies 7890 a gas chromatograph instrument with a fused silica hp 5 ms capillary column length 30 m inner diameter 0 25 mm film thickness 0 25 µm was used to determine the composition of essential oil the carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 1 5 ml min 1 and a split ratio of 1 10 inlet pressure of 17 7 psi injector and detector temperatures were set at 210 and 220ºc respectively the oven temperature was programmed as 70 c hold 1 min ramp 4 to 200 c hold 1 min the chromatographer was coupled to the agilent 5975 c mass spectrometer as a selective detector with ionization voltage of 70 ev ion source and mass quadrupole temperatures of 230 and 150 c and mass range of 35 500 m z the gc msd chemstation program was used as the operating software the retention indices were calculated for all of the volatile constituents by using retention times of n alkanes c9 c20 injected before essential oil analysis in the same conditions using the kovats index formula adams 2007 identification of the chemical constituents of the oil was done based on the comparison of retention indices ris with those reported in the literature as well as comparing their mass spectra and fragmentation pattern with the mass spectra characteristic features obtained from the nist 08 national institute of standards and technology wiley 275 l with minor changes adams 2007 the percentage of compounds was calculated according to the peak areas of the total oil components 2 6 statistical analyses prior to analysis of variance anova the normality distribution of data was examined the homogeneity of residual variance was tested by the bartlett test before combining the data of the two years subsequently a combined analysis of variance proposed by steel and torrie 1980 was conducted using proc mixed of sas release 9 4 sas institute cary nc usa to examine the differences between the families years moisture environments and their interaction and also to estimate the variance components steel and torrie 1980 nguyen and sleper 1983 where the f value was significant trait means were compared using the fisher s least significant difference lsd test at p 05 steel and torrie 1980 to examine the relationship among the traits pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between traits using proc corr of sas heritability was estimated according to nguyen and sleper 1983 h 2 σ g 2 σ g 2 σ ge 2 e σ gy 2 y σ gey 2 ey σ δ 2 re σ ϵ 2 rey where h 2 represents the heritability σ g 2 is the genotype σ ge 2 is the genotype environment σ gy 2 is the genotype year σ gey 2 is the genotype environment year variance σ δ 2 and σ ϵ 2 are the error variance and the residual variance respectively while g e y and r represent the number of genotypes families environments years and replications respectively data were also subjected to anova separately for normal and water deficit conditions variance components were also estimated for each moisture condition normal and water deficit conditions separately using proc mixed of sas heritability on a phenotypic mean basis averaged over replications and years was estimated according to the following formula nguyen and sleper 1983 h 2 σ g 2 σ g 2 σ gy 2 y σ gr 2 r σ e 2 ry where h 2 represents the heritability σ g 2 is the genotype σ gy 2 is the genotype year σ gr 2 is the genotype replication variance and σ e 2 is the error variance while g y and r represent the number of genotypes families years and replications respectively it should be noted that h2 in open pollinated progenies represents an estimation of narrow sense heritability h n 2 and in selfed progenies it gives an estimation of broad sense heritability h b 2 araujo and coulman 2002 to estimate the level of genetic variation the genotypic coefficient of variation gcv was calculated by using the following equation gcv σ g μ 100 where σ g is the standard deviation of the genotypic variance and µ is the phenotypic mean general combining ability gca was calculated for important traits as the deviation of each half sib family from the mean of all families wricke and weber 1986 principal component analysis pca was performed based on a correlation matrix using statgraphics software version 15 2 11 statgraphics technologies the plains va usa 3 results 3 1 analysis of variance and genetic variation eight essential oil constituents were identified among the families of both populations the main compounds were trans anethole fenchone estragole and limonene fig 1 results from the anova revealed that in the s1 and op populations there were significant differences p 0 05 between the normal and water deficit conditions for all traits the effect of family was significant for all measured traits with the exception of γ terpinene in the s1 population indicating significant variation among the selected families with a broad range for each trait family environment interaction was significant for seed yield per plant and essential oil yield in the s1 population and for seed yield per plant essential oil yield γ terpinene and anisaldehyde in op one tables 2 and 3 additionally in both populations the effects of year and family year interaction were non significant for most evaluated characteristics tables 2 and 3 genotypic coefficients of variation gcv for s1 and op populations under normal and water deficit conditions are presented in table 4 in selfed progenies higher gcv values gcv 50 in normal condition were obtained for α pinene β myrcene limonene γ terpinene estragole and anisaldehyde in water deficit condition the higher gcv values were observed for α pinene and estragole in open pollinated progenies the higher gcv values were observed for α pinene γ terpinene estragole and anisaldehyde under both moisture conditions table 4 for some traits such as seed yield per plant essential oil yield and α pinene in the s1 population and seed yield per plant essential oil yield α pinene and β myrcene in the op population the genetic variation under water deficit was higher than normal condition for the remaining traits of both populations variation was higher under normal condition table 4 based on gcv in the s1 population relatively higher range of genetic variation was observed for estragole γ terpinene and limonene and a relatively lower range of genetic variance was detected for seed yield per plant trans anethole fenchone α pinene and essential oil yield in the op population γ terpinene and anisaldehyde showed a higher range of genetic variation and estragole seed yield per plant essential oil yield limonene and β myrcene had a relatively lower range table 4 3 2 mean comparisons of traits mean comparisons of s1 and op populations for main components of essential oil are given in tables 5 and 6 respectively in the s1 population trans anethole ranged from 11 24 to 95 97 with an average of 80 11 under normal condition and from 8 48 to 92 17 with an average of 77 95 under water deficit condition under normal condition family s1 35 had the lowest value of this component and families s1 13 and s1 4 showed the higher values of it under water deficit condition s1 35 had the lowest value of this component and family s1 4 had the highest value of it table 5 estragole varied considerably and ranged from 1 30 to 75 36 with an average of 9 72 under normal condition and from 2 11 to 80 85 with an average of 11 18 under water deficit condition under both normal and water deficit conditions family s1 35 had the highest value of this component while under normal condition the lower values of this component were observed for families s1 13 s1 46 s1 33 s1 4 s1 43 s1 27 and s1 26 and under water deficit were detected for families s1 43 s1 46 s1 33 s1 4 and s1 37 respectively table 5 under normal condition the highest value of fenchone was observed for s1 35 and the lowest one was detected for s1 31 under water deficit condition s1 35 and s1 13 had higher values of this component respectively while families s1 46 s1 4 and s1 31 had the lower values of fenchone in this condition table 5 in the op population trans anethole ranged from 30 54 to 93 93 with an average of 75 79 under normal condition and from 21 55 to 90 30 with an average of 72 80 under water deficit condition table 6 under normal condition op 44 and op 49 showed the lower values of this component and families op 14 op 15 op 17 op 1 op 45 op 5 op 12 op 40 op 46 op 10 op 39 op 41 op 22 and op 42 had the higher values for this component under water deficit condition the lowest value of trans anethole was detected for op 44 other families had high and moderate values of it table 6 under normal condition the parental genotypes of families op 44 and op 49 and under water deficit parental genotype of op 44 had lower gcas for trans anethole and therefore are bad combiners while the parental genotypes of other families under normal and water deficit conditions had moderate to high gcas for this component and therefore are good combiners table 7 estragole varied considerably and ranged from 0 62 to 54 71 with an average of 12 43 under normal condition and from 1 91 to 60 50 with an average of 14 18 under water deficit condition families op 44 and op 25 had higher values of estragole under normal condition under water deficit family op 44 had the highest value of estragole table 6 under normal condition the parental genotypes of op 44 and op 25 and under water deficit parental genotype of op 44 had higher gcas respectively and therefore are good combiners for estragole table 7 under normal and water deficit conditions the highest value of fenchone was observed for op 49 table 6 the parental genotype of this family had highest value of gca and therefore is good combiner table 7 3 3 effect of water deficit and matting systems mean comparisons of all measured traits for the two moisture conditions in two separate populations are given in table 4 as expected water deficit strongly reduced seed yield per plant essential oil yield α pinene trans anethole and anisaldehyde while significantly increased β myrcene limonene γ terpinene fenchone and estragole in s1 and op populations compared with normal condition water deficit approximately reduced seed yield per plant by 61 and 58 in s1 and op populations respectively for essential oil yield these reductions were approximately 50 and 43 in the same populations relative to normal condition table 4 to assess drought tolerance of the fennel populations two selection indices of sti and ysi were calculated by using seed yield per plant sti syp and ysi syp and essential oil yield sti eoy and ysi eoy biplots of sti syp and ysi syp for s1 and op populations and distribution of selfed and open pollinated progenies are shown in fig 2a and b respectively based on the results in the s1 population the higher values of sti syp were observed for families 9 38 33 35 31 and 13 and the lower values were detected for families 43 46 37 44 49 and 5 respectively the higher values of ysi syp were obtained for families 2 13 41 33 and 27 and the lower values of this index were observed for families 4 43 5 44 and 8 respectively fig 2a in the op population the higher values of sti syp were observed for families 38 26 33 9 41 and 32 and the lower values were detected for families 15 25 17 1 24 and 10 respectively the higher values for ysi syp were obtained for families 13 38 31 7 and 30 and the lower values of this index were detected for families 25 10 17 1 and 22 respectively fig 2b compared with open pollination selfing reduced the mean performance of seed and essential oil yield α pinene β myrcene and limonene under normal condition and seed and essential oil yield β myrcene and limonene under water deficit condition demonstrating the effects of inbreeding on these traits however self pollination did not affect the remaining phytochemical components of essential oil significantly table 8 3 4 variance components and heritability the estimates of heritability and variance components were calculated for each moisture condition separately and are presented in table 9 under both moisture conditions moderate to high values of heritability were estimated for all traits in both populations except for seed yield per plant in s1 population and seed yield per plant and limonene in op one results revealed that in the s1 population heritability estimates fluctuated from 44 71 for seed yield per plant to 74 40 for limonene under normal condition and from 39 25 for seed yield per plant to 67 79 for β myrcene under water deficit condition in the op population it ranged from 47 24 for limonene to 69 27 for trans anethole in normal condition and from 31 09 for limonene to 77 81 for estragole in water deficit condition table 9 results also showed that for all traits and in both populations higher heritability estimates were observed under normal condition than water deficit moreover for some of the evaluated traits such as γ terpinene fenchone estragole and trans anethole heritability estimates were higher in the op population than in the s1 one while limonene and β myrcene had higher heritability estimates in the s1 population than in op one table 9 3 5 association among traits and biplot analysis phenotypic correlation coefficients between different traits for s1 and op populations are given in tables 10 and 11 in the s1 population seed yield per plant was positively correlated with essential oil yield β myrcene sti syp and sti eoy under normal condition while under water deficit condition had positive correlations with essential oil yield ysi syp sti syp and sti eoy table 10 in the op population under normal condition seed yield per plant had significant and positive correlations with essential oil yield β myrcene anisaldehyde sti syp and sti eoy while under water deficit condition it was positively associated with essential oil yield β myrcene limonene anisaldehyde ysi syp ysi eoy sti syp and sti eoy and negatively associated with trans anethole table 11 in the s1 population essential oil yield showed positive correlations with seed yield per plant α pinene β myrcene estragole sti syp and sti eoy under normal condition while under water deficit it was positively associated with seed yield per plant limonene fenchone ysi syp sti syp and sti eoy table 10 moreover in the op population this trait showed positive associations with seed yield per plant β myrcene γ terpinene anisaldehyde sti syp and sti eoy under normal condition and with seed yield per plant β myrcene limonene anisaldehyde ysi syp sti syp ysi eoy and sti eoy under water deficit table 11 among the phytochemical constituents of essential oil β myrcene was positively associated with seed yield per plant essential oil yield limonene fenchone sti syp and sti eoy under normal and water deficit conditions in the op population and under normal condition in s1 one under normal and water deficit conditions γ terpinene had significant and positive correlation with anisaldehyde in s1 population while in op population there was significant and negative association between these two constituents of essential oil moreover in s1 population trans anethole had significant and negative associations with fenchone estragole and anisaldehyde under normal condition and with estragole under water deficit while in the op population this constituent was negatively correlated with β myrcene fenchone estragole and anisaldehyde under normal condition and with seed yield per plant β myrcene fenchone estragole ysi syp and ysi eoy under water deficit tables 10 and 11 in both s1 and op populations principal component analysis was performed based on all measured traits under normal and water deficit conditions it was shown that in the s1 population the first two principal components explained more than 48 and 51 of the total variation incorporated in the data under the normal and water deficit conditions respectively fig 3a and b under normal condition fig 3a the first principal component pc1 was positively correlated with seed yield per plant essential oil yield β myrcene estragole sti syp and sti eoy hence this component was considered as productivity essential oil constituents and drought tolerance component principal component 2 pc2 which had positive correlations with fenchone estragole and anisaldehyde and was negatively associated with trans anethole was considered to represent the essential oil constituents selection of families with high values of pc1 and pc2 would improve productivity drought tolerance and essential oil components of this species in this respect family 35 was the superior one fig 3a under water deficit fig 3b pc1 had positive correlations with seed yield per plant essential oil yield fenchone ysi syp sti syp and sti eoy therefore it was considered to be the productivity and drought tolerance component the second component pc2 was positively correlated with limonene and trans anethole and negatively associated with estragole therefore it was named essential oil constituents selection of families with high values of pc1 and pc2 i e families 9 33 and 35 would improve productivity phytochemical constituents of essential oil and drought tolerance of studied germplasm results of pca in the op population showed that the first two components justified 27 55 and 18 57 of the total variation under normal condition and 35 90 and 16 77 under water deficit condition respectively figs 3c and 3d under normal condition fig 3c pc1 had positive correlations with seed yield essential oil yield sti syp and sti eoy and therefore was considered as the drought tolerance and essential oil productivity on the other hand pc2 had positive correlations with limonene estragole ysi syp and ysi eoy and negative correlation with trans anethole fig 3c hence it was called yield stability and essential oil constituents thus improvement in productivity yield stability essential oil components and drought tolerance of fennel can be obtained by selecting families with high in pc1 and pc2 in this respect families 1 8 13 14 and 15 were the superior ones having high productivity yield stability and essential oil components and were drought tolerant in contrast families 4 7 22 27 and 39 had low productivity yield stability and essential oil components and were identified as drought sensitive ones fig 3c under water deficit fig 3d pc1 had positive correlations with seed yield essential oil yield ysi syp sti syp ysi eoy and sti eoy and negative association with trans anethole therefore it was named productivity drought tolerance and yield stability moreover pc2 had positive correlations with β myrcene and estragole and negative associations with trans anethole anisaldehyde and sti eoy therefore it was considered to represent the drought tolerance and essential oil constituents of fennel selection based on high values of pc1 and pc2 can lead to improvement of drought tolerance and essential oil production of fennel in this respect families 8 33 and 38 were the superior ones 4 discussion devising and implementing breeding programs for each species depends on the reproductive system and information about the genetic variation and genetic control of traits this information helps scientists to find new strategies to cope with abiotic stresses especially drought in the medicinal plants here we developed two different genetic populations of selfed and open pollinated in fennel to evaluate the effects of selfing and open pollination on the productivity and essential oil components of fennel in different moisture environments screen drought tolerant families and estimate genetic parameters significant differences were observed among families and between the two moisture environments for all measured traits suggesting that there is considerable genotypic variation among these families studied at both normal and water deficit conditions due to the wide range of genotypic geographical origins the presence of a high level of variability in collected entries is expected and was in agreement with the results obtained by sengupta et al 2014 the family by moisture environment f e interaction was significant for most of the evaluated traits demonstrating that the relative performance of the families was not static and changed across the two moisture environments which was in agreement with the report of parmoon et al 2022 wide genetic variation observed for the studied traits is promising for genetic gain through selection in this germplasm moreover the gcv values for most of the evaluated traits were higher under the normal condition than water deficit indicating that water deficit reduced the genetic variation of these traits blum 2011 has reported that the rate of genetic advance through selection is usually higher under normal condition the importance of fennel as a medicinal and spice plant and its agricultural importance has arisen the need to improve the composition of commercial fennel fruits pank et al 2003 gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis revealed the presence of eight major chemicals in our germplasm results revealed that the content and chemical composition of essential oil is very variable in different families cosge et al 2008 also reported significant differences in essential oil composition between different varieties of f vulgare ssp capillaceum napoli et al 2010 reported that the fennel essential oil variation can be related to the geographical origins and ecological situations related to the climatic conditions of the growing localities moreover trans anethole estragole fenchone and limonene were found to be the main constituents of essential oil in this germplasm similar to our results in the studies of napoli et al 2010 zheljazkov et al 2013 and cosge et al 2008 trans anethole estragole limonene and fenchone were also reported as the main components of essential oil in fennel the ability of plants to tolerate water deficit condition is critical for plant productivity all over the world in the present study water deficit caused a drastic reduction in seed yield per plant in both s1 and op populations which is evidently due to inadequate photosynthesis owing to stomata closure in response to low soil moisture and consequently limited carbon dioxide uptake fahad et al 2017 khodadadi et al 2018 and parmoon et al 2022 also reported that the seed yield and quality including aromatic oil content of fennel seeds were reduced by drought stress during seed development similarly water deficit caused a large decrease in seed yield of caraway carum carvi l laribi et al 2009 and cumin cuminum cyminum l rebey et al 2012 under water deficit even though the percentage of essential oil was increased the essential oil yield was decreased significantly considering that the essential oil yield is obtained from the product of the seed yield and the percentage of essential oil it can be concluded that the decrease in essential oil yield under water deficit condition was due to the reduction of grain yield a decrease in essential oil yield with the decrease in the amount of irrigation water has also been reported in other plants i e ardakani et al 2007 bettaieb et al 2011 also reported that although moisture stress increased the percentage of cumin essential oil but due to the decrease in seed yield under water deficit the yield of essential oil was decreased significantly in this condition compared to full irrigation treatment moreover water deficit significantly decreased α pinene trans anethole and anisaldehyde while it significantly increased β myrcene limonene γ terpinene fenchone and estragole in the s1 and op populations the development of genotypes with high yield under normal condition and smaller yield reduction under water deficit is the main purpose of breeding for drought tolerance selection indices such as sti can distinguish these tolerant genotypes from others fernandez 1992 in this study several families were identified with higher values of sti from both populations families 9 13 31 33 35 and 38 in the s1 population and families 2 13 27 33 and 41 in the op population these families seem to have a higher yield potential under water deficit condition and may be further improved by crossing to families having higher values of ysi i e families 9 26 32 33 38 and 41 in the s1 population and families 7 13 30 31 and 38 in the op population that were stable under both moisture conditions the s1 progenies had lower seed productivity essential oil yield β myrcene and limonene than did the op progenies under both moisture conditions which can be related to the inbreeding depression effects inbreeding changes the mean phenotypes in a way that usually leads to a decrease in fitness this reduction in fitness is commonly thought to result from increased genetic homozygosity associated with inbreeding either through increased expression of deleterious recessive alleles or loss of overdominant allele combinations charlesworth and charlesworth 1987 however there were no significant differences between s1 and op progenies in terms of γ terpinene fenchone estragole trans anethole and anisaldehyde the lack of significant differences between s1 and op for some characters evaluated in this study suggests low heterosis for these traits estimation of heritability is an important purpose of genetic study of traits in the breeding programs because it can determine the influence of environmental and genetic factors on the traits of interest for assessing the efficiency of selection and provides early information for designing an effective breeding program to maximize genetic gain through selection hallauer et al 2010 as stated earlier the variance among half sib families primarily represents additive genetic variance incorporated in phenotypic variance therefore the heritability value of op population represents an estimation of narrow sense heritability h2 n nguyen and sleper 1983 meanwhile in the s1 population the variance among the family means represents additive and non additive genetic variance incorporated in the phenotypic variance therefore the heritability value of this population is an estimation of broad sense heritability results revealed that in the s1 progenies moderate to high values of broad sense heritability were obtained for all traits except for seed yield per plant under normal and water deficit conditions indicating that these traits were less affected by the environment and direct selection for these traits would be effective for further improvement meena et al 2019 in the op population the narrow sense heritability estimates were moderate to high for all traits under both moisture conditions with the exception of seed yield per plant and limonene indicating that a large part of the total genetic variation was additive and recurrent or mass selection would likely be successful for their improvement yadav et al 2012 also reported low heritability estimates for seed yield in fennel which is in agreement with the results of the present study however no literature was found on the heritability of phytochemical constituents of essential oil especially in the s1 and op progenies moreover for all of the studied traits the estimates of heritability were higher under normal condition than water deficit this may be due to the fact that environmental changes can induce the change of gene expression and genetic variation of these traits which can adjust the regulation of plant growth and metabolism to the new environment rumbaugh et al 1984 the correlation coefficient as an important statistical parameter is of interest to anticipate how the selection pressure exerted on one trait will affect the other traits results of correlation coefficients and pca analysis indicated that seed yield per plant and essential oil yield had significant and positive correlations with sti syp and sti eoy under normal and water deficit conditions in both populations these correlations indicate that the more drought tolerant families have also more seed productivity and essential oil yield in the s1 population seed yield per plant and essential oil yield were positively associated with β myrcene and α pinene under normal condition and with limonene and fenchone under water deficit while in the op population seed yield per plant and essential oil yield had significant and positive associations with β myrcene and anisaldehyde under normal condition and with β myrcene anisaldehyde and limonene under water deficit condition these relationships were verified by the pca method and indicated that any increase in these constituents might be associated with the increase of seed production and essential oil and vice versa these results also showed that water deficit has changed the relationships between different traits results also revealed that in the s1 population trans anethole was negatively associated with fenchone and anisaldehyde under normal condition moreover in this population trans anethole and estragole had significant and negative association under normal and water deficit conditions in the op population trans anethole was negatively correlated with β myrcene fenchone and estragole and also γ terpinene and anisaldehyde were negatively associated under both conditions under normal condition anisaldehyde had significant and negative associations with β myrcene limonene and trans anethole these negative associations between essential oil components indicate that some of these components are isomers and this relationship can limit the simultaneous selection of several components for example telci et al 2009 stated that trans anethole is an isomer of fenchone with the only position of the double bond of the propenyl chain gross et al 2009 and raal et al 2011 reported negative correlation between trans anethole and estragole which are generally in agreement with our findings and it is stated that these two components may have a common biosynthetic precursor gross et al 2009 in conclusion high genetic variation observed between and within the studied populations highlighted the fact that any change in mating system could clearly change the genetic structure of germplasm results revealed that the main constituents of fennel essential oil were trans anethole estragole fenchone and limonene most of which have significant bioactivities the results of the current study provide for the first time the data on the simultaneous effect of inbreeding and water deficit on the secondary metabolites of different fennel populations selfing led to decrease in seed productivity essential oil yield β myrcene and limonene of fennel families water deficit caused substantial reductions in seed yield essential oil yield α pinene trans anethole and anisaldehyde and therefore reduced genotypic variation of them results also showed that water deficit changed the relationships between different traits because of the moderately low heritability for seed yield both genetic and non genetic effects played a role in controlling this trait therefore selection based on an index which is a weighted linear combination of several traits may be more effective for the improvement of seed yield per plant in recurrent selection programs moreover there were significant associations between some essential oil components which can be useful for indirect selection evaluation of families through sti and ysi allowed the identification of drought tolerant and stable families in the studied germplasm based on the sti and multivariate analyses parental genotypes of families 9 13 33 and 35 from the s1 population and 8 13 33 and 38 from op one were identified as the superior genotypes they had higher seed production essential oil content yield stability and drought tolerance and therefore can be recommended to use in the future breeding programs future studies should focus on evaluating the effects of other abiotic stresses agronomic conditions and harvest time on phytochemical constituents of the essential oil of fennel moreover evaluation of essential oil composition of self pollinated genotypes of fennel in the next generations can be suggested for the future breeding programs in fennel funding this research did not receive

9123,limited information is available on the impact of deliberate selfing compared with open pollination and its interaction with water deficit on productivity and phytochemical constituents of essential oil in fennel foeniculum vulgare mill and also the genetic analysis of traits during this research 21 selfed s1 and 42 open pollinated op progenies of fennel developed in 2017 18 were evaluated in the field under well watered and water deficit conditions in two years 2019 and 2020 for phytochemical and productivity traits gc ms analysis revealed that among the eight different compounds in the essential oil trans anethole fenchone estragole and limonene were found to be the main constituents water deficit greatly decreased grain yield and essential oil content α pinene trans anethole and anisaldehyde while significantly increased β myrcene limonene γ terpinene fenchone and estragole in both populations compared with open pollination selfing reduced the mean performance of seed and essential oil yield β myrcene and limonene under normal and water deficit conditions and α pinene under normal condition demonstrating the effects of inbreeding on these traits the relationship between γ terpinene and anisaldehyde was positive in the s1 population while in the op population there was significant and negative association between these two constituents the genetic analysis of traits indicated that additive gene action played an important role in controlling most of the traits but that both additive and non additive gene effects played a role in the genetic control of grain yield indicating that selection based on an index may be more useful for improvement of grain yield in recurrent selection programs abbreviations aneth trans anethole anis

introduction fennel foeniculum vulgare mill a medicinal and aromatic plant belonging to the apiaceae family is an annual biennial or perennial herb pavela et al 2016 it is considered native indigenous to southern europe and the mediterranean area gross et al 2009 but has been domesticated and introduced into many regions outside that zone zoubiri et al 2014 it is grown for production of essential oil or is used as herb throughout the world the essential oil content of fennel is about 2 4 which is used as flavoring agents in food products such as beverages bread pickles pastries and cheese shahat et al 2011 the main constituents of essential oil in fennel are trans anethole estragole fenchone and limonene cosge et al 2008 the composition of essential oil is determined by different factors such as species variety and environment rebey et al 2012 however many factors such as soil conditions soil water levels nemeth zambori et al 2016 quality and intensity of light souza et al 2016 noguchi and amaki 2016 and different pollination and reproductive systems figueiredo et al 2008 could limit the production of essential oil and other compounds of medicinal plants drought is a primary abiotic constraint affecting the growth survival and productivity of plants in arid and semi arid regions of the world ciais et al 2005 and will become more frequent and severe with climate change and deficiencies of fresh water caused by population growth ipcc 2014 it leads to biochemical disorders and can change plant behavior regarding the biosynthesis of primary and secondary metabolites rebey et al 2012 in addition drought influences essential oil biosynthesis and therefore affects the composition of essential oil laribi et al 2009 therefore there is an increasing need for plant species or genotypes that can grow under water limited situations affordable and reliable selection indices such as the stress tolerance index sti and yield stability index ysi which provide a measure of stress tolerance based on performance under stress and non stress conditions have been recommended for screening drought tolerant genotypes phenotyping based on these indices along with agronomic and phytochemical traits may facilitate the identification of preferable and effective traits which accelerate the improvement of yield potential and performance under drought stress condition the reproductive system of medicinal plants has been investigated to provide a basis for the genetic improvement of essential oil and secondary metabolites richardson et al 2016 the development of self pollinated plants has an important role in the improvement of medicinal plants populations through fixing some traits the most important problem in self pollinating is inbreeding depression which commonly occurs in outcrossing species when they are enforced to be self pollinated inbreeding is defined as the mating of closely related individuals and the reduction in the fitness of inbred progenies compared with the offspring from unrelated parents is called inbreeding depression henter 2003 the magnitude and specific effects of inbreeding are dependent on the genetic structure of the species or population and the genotype environment interaction and therefore are highly variable hedrick and kalinowski 2000 however selfing does not always lead to negative effects on plants it facilitates the development of inbred lines which is important for the construction of special populations for genetic studies considering the importance of fennel as a vegetable and medicinal herb current information about the breeding of important fitness traits under selfing and open pollination is limited in this species the success of breeding programs requires information on the extent and nature of genetic variability heritability and association among different traits half sib hs mating such as open pollination and polycross is widely used to estimate genetic parameters in quantitative genetic studies araujo et al 2002 since the genetic variance among hs families is equal to one fourth of the additive genetic variance assuming there is no additive x additive types of epistatic variance estimation of heritability based on the analysis of hs families gives a good prediction of narrow sense heritability kearsey and pooni 1996 although the chemical constituents of the seed essential oil of fennel are well studied abou el nasr et al 2013 zheljazkov et al 2013 figueredo et al 2016 there is a lack of information regarding the effects of inbreeding depression compared with open pollination water deficit condition compared with normal and their interactions on the essential oil and its phytochemical constituents of fennel genotypes moreover despite the large number of studies conducted on different characteristics of fennel limited information is available on the genetic analysis of essential oil content and its phytochemical constitutes therefore this study was conducted to i determine and compare the content and constituents of seed essential oil among lines derived from two genetic populations of fennel selfed and half sib progenies under normal and water deficit conditions ii assess the inheritance and genetic basis of the mentioned traits as well as the effect of water deficit on genetic variation and inheritance of traits and iii demonstrate the first generation consequences of inbreeding and outbreeding for offspring fitness under normal and water deficit conditions and selecting superior genotypes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this research was conducted in the research farm of the isfahan university of technology isfahan iran 32 30 n 51 20 e 1630 m amsl in 2019 and 2020 this region had a typic haplargid silty clay loam soil with ph 8 3 and is characterized by annual precipitation of 140 mm and mean annual temperature of 14 5 c in this region summers are dry usually with no rain from late may to mid october therefore supplemental irrigation is needed for growing crops during this period 2 2 plant materials in this study 42 op and 21 s1 families were constructed from open and self pollination of 50 parental ecotypes of fennel during 2016 and 2017 and used as the genetic material the parental plants were mainly consisted of natural ecotypes of fennel from wide geographical areas of iran plus some foreign ecotypes which were kindly provided by the leibniz institute of plant genetics and crop plant research ipk table 1 the parental genotypes were grown in the field in a randomized complete block design with four replications in march 2015 in each plot plants were cultivated in two 4 m long rows 50 cm row spacing and a within row spacing of 40 cm and evaluated for four years from 2015 to 2018 table 1 during these four years irrigation was conducted with no limitation and applied when 50 of the soil available water was exhausted from the root zone in 2016 and 2017 50 of newly emerged umbels on each plant were isolated in paper bags before anthesis to enforce self pollination and the second half in the same plant were left uncovered to be open pollinated the bags were handmade light transparent oiled paper bags proportional to the length of inflorescences at the complete maturity stage the seeds of the plants were harvested separately from the selfed and the open pollinated panicles at the end of the summer then seeds of each family for the two harvest years were bulked to have enough seeds for the progeny field evaluation from the 50 parental ecotypes 42 ecotypes produced enough op seeds and 21 ecotypes produced enough s1 seeds consequently two populations that is 21 selfed progenies s1 and 42 open pollinated op progenies families of half sibs were developed as the genetic material for this study table 1 on first march 2018 the seeds of each s1 and op populations were grown in the field and were evaluated during 2018 2020 using a split plot experiment according to a randomized complete block design with four repetitions each plot contained four rows of 3 m length in which plants were grown with the intervals of 50 cm between rows and 40 cm between plants within row 2 3 applying water deficit and field evaluations plants were grown under normal condition during 2018 for complete establishment after establishment the families were evaluated under two moisture conditions of normal and water deficit during 2019 and 2020 under normal and water deficit conditions water was supplied when 50 and 90 of the plant available water paw was exhausted from the root zone respectively which was calculated according to allen et al 1998 as paw θfc θpwp where θfc is the soil gravimetric moisture percentage at the field capacity and θpwp is the soil gravimetric moisture percentage at the wilting point in each year of the experiment water deficit was alternatively applied during the growing season from first of may to the first of october to determine the amount of irrigation water and detect the irrigation times soil samples were taken from different sites of each moisture condition at the depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm using a hand auger and the gravimetric soil water content was measured clarke topp et al 2008 at the irrigation time the irrigation depth was determined according to the following equation i θfc θirri 100 d b where i is the irrigation depth cm θfc is the soil gravimetric moisture percentage at the field capacity θirri is the soil gravimetric moisture percentage at the irrigation time d is the root zone depth and b is the soil bulk density at root zone 1 4 g cm 3 water was delivered to the field using a drip irrigation system through a pumping station polyethylene pipes and drip tapes a volumetric counter was used to measure the water volume applied under each moisture condition during the plant establishment year 2018 no data were recorded traits were recorded during the growing seasons of 2019 and 2020 the agro morphological and phytochemical traits that were evaluated under two levels of irrigation normal and water deficit included seed yield per plant syp g plant seed essential oil content eoc and phytochemical constitutes of essential oil seed yield per plant was measured based on 10 randomly selected samples of each family and the mean value of these 10 plants was calculated and used for analyses essential oil content and phytochemical constitutes of essential oil were measured as percent using 50 g of seeds of each family inbreeding depression id for each trait was calculated using the following formula id mop ms mop 100 where mop is the mean value of the open pollinated population and ms is the mean value of the self pollinated population to differentiate the drought tolerant and susceptible families two drought tolerance and susceptibility indices were calculated separately for seed yield and essential oil yield stress tolerance index sti fernandez 1992 which can be used to identify families that produce high yields under both normal and water deficit conditions and yield stability index ysi bouslama and schapaugh 1984 which is the ratio of yield under water deficit to the yield under normal condition were calculated according to the following formulations sti ypi ysi ymp 2 ysi ysi ypi where ysi is the seed yield and essential oil yield of a given family grown under water deficit ypi designates that of a given family grown under normal condition and yms is the seed yield and essential oil yield mean over all families grown under water deficit 2 4 essential oil extraction extraction of essential oil was conducted by hydrodistillation of dried ripe seeds previously dried for 24 h at 70 c of each fennel family for 3 h zheljazkov et al 2013 using a clevenger type apparatus for this purpose dried seeds of each family were ground into fine powder using an electric grinder and then 50 g of powdered seeds were placed in a round bottom flask distillates of essential oils were subsequently collected using diethyl ether v v filtered stored in the sealed glass vials and kept in 4 c until gc ms analyses the essential oil content was determined based on the weight of the dry seeds using the following equation essential oil content eoc weight of eo recovered g weight of seed g 100 essential oil yield eoy g plant was calculated from multiplication of seed yield per plant with essential oil content for each family abou el nasr et al 2013 2 5 gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analyses gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis with the agilent technologies 7890 a gas chromatograph instrument with a fused silica hp 5 ms capillary column length 30 m inner diameter 0 25 mm film thickness 0 25 µm was used to determine the composition of essential oil the carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 1 5 ml min 1 and a split ratio of 1 10 inlet pressure of 17 7 psi injector and detector temperatures were set at 210 and 220ºc respectively the oven temperature was programmed as 70 c hold 1 min ramp 4 to 200 c hold 1 min the chromatographer was coupled to the agilent 5975 c mass spectrometer as a selective detector with ionization voltage of 70 ev ion source and mass quadrupole temperatures of 230 and 150 c and mass range of 35 500 m z the gc msd chemstation program was used as the operating software the retention indices were calculated for all of the volatile constituents by using retention times of n alkanes c9 c20 injected before essential oil analysis in the same conditions using the kovats index formula adams 2007 identification of the chemical constituents of the oil was done based on the comparison of retention indices ris with those reported in the literature as well as comparing their mass spectra and fragmentation pattern with the mass spectra characteristic features obtained from the nist 08 national institute of standards and technology wiley 275 l with minor changes adams 2007 the percentage of compounds was calculated according to the peak areas of the total oil components 2 6 statistical analyses prior to analysis of variance anova the normality distribution of data was examined the homogeneity of residual variance was tested by the bartlett test before combining the data of the two years subsequently a combined analysis of variance proposed by steel and torrie 1980 was conducted using proc mixed of sas release 9 4 sas institute cary nc usa to examine the differences between the families years moisture environments and their interaction and also to estimate the variance components steel and torrie 1980 nguyen and sleper 1983 where the f value was significant trait means were compared using the fisher s least significant difference lsd test at p 05 steel and torrie 1980 to examine the relationship among the traits pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between traits using proc corr of sas heritability was estimated according to nguyen and sleper 1983 h 2 σ g 2 σ g 2 σ ge 2 e σ gy 2 y σ gey 2 ey σ δ 2 re σ ϵ 2 rey where h 2 represents the heritability σ g 2 is the genotype σ ge 2 is the genotype environment σ gy 2 is the genotype year σ

years and replications respectively data were also subjected to anova separately for normal and water deficit conditions variance components were also estimated for each moisture condition normal and water deficit conditions separately using proc mixed of sas heritability on a phenotypic mean basis averaged over replications and years was estimated according to the following formula nguyen and

coefficient of variation gcv was calculated by using the following equation gcv σ g μ 100 where σ g is the standard deviation of the genotypic variance and µ is the phenotypic mean general combining ability gca was calculated for important traits as the deviation of each half sib family from the mean of all families wricke and weber 1986 principal component analysis pca was performed based on a correlation matrix using statgraphics software version 15 2 11 statgraphics technologies the plains va usa 3 results 3 1 analysis of variance and genetic variation eight essential oil constituents were identified among the families of both populations the main compounds were trans anethole fenchone estragole and limonene fig 1 results from the anova revealed that in the s1 and op populations there were significant differences p 0 05 between the normal and water deficit conditions for all traits the effect of family was significant for all measured traits with the exception of γ terpinene in the s1 population indicating significant variation among the selected families with a broad range for each trait family environment interaction was significant for seed yield per plant and essential oil yield in the s1 population and for seed yield per plant essential oil yield γ terpinene and anisaldehyde in op one tables 2 and 3 additionally in both populations the effects of year and family year interaction were non significant for most evaluated characteristics tables 2 and 3 genotypic coefficients of variation gcv for s1 and op populations under normal and water deficit conditions are presented in table 4 in selfed progenies higher gcv values gcv 50 in normal condition were obtained for α pinene β myrcene limonene γ terpinene estragole and anisaldehyde in water deficit condition the higher gcv values were observed for α pinene and estragole in open pollinated progenies the higher gcv values were observed for α pinene γ terpinene estragole and anisaldehyde under both moisture conditions table 4 for some traits such as seed yield per plant essential oil yield and α pinene in the s1 population and seed yield per plant essential oil yield α pinene and β myrcene in the op population the genetic variation under water deficit was higher than normal condition for the remaining traits of both populations variation was higher under normal condition table 4 based on gcv in the s1 population relatively higher range of genetic variation was observed for estragole γ terpinene and limonene and a relatively lower range of genetic variance was detected for seed yield per plant trans anethole fenchone α pinene and essential oil yield in the op population γ terpinene and anisaldehyde showed a higher range of genetic variation and estragole seed yield per plant essential oil yield limonene and β myrcene had a relatively lower range table 4 3 2 mean comparisons of traits mean comparisons of s1 and op populations for main components of essential oil are given in tables 5 and 6 respectively in the s1 population trans anethole ranged from 11 24 to 95 97 with an average of 80 11 under normal condition and from 8 48 to 92 17 with an average of 77 95 under water deficit condition under normal condition family s1 35 had the lowest value of this component and families s1 13 and s1 4 showed the higher values of it under water deficit condition s1 35 had the lowest value of this component and family s1 4 had the highest value of it table 5 estragole varied considerably and ranged from 1 30 to 75 36 with an average of 9 72 under normal condition and from 2 11 to 80 85 with an average of 11 18 under water deficit condition under both normal and water deficit conditions family s1 35 had the highest value of this component while under normal condition the lower values of this component were observed for families s1 13 s1 46 s1 33 s1 4 s1 43 s1 27 and s1 26 and under water deficit were detected for families s1 43 s1 46 s1 33 s1 4 and s1 37 respectively table 5 under normal condition the highest value of fenchone was observed for s1 35 and the lowest one was detected for s1 31 under water deficit condition s1 35 and s1 13 had higher values of this component respectively while families s1 46 s1 4 and s1 31 had the lower values of fenchone in this condition table 5 in the op population trans anethole ranged from 30 54 to 93 93 with an average of 75 79 under normal condition and from 21 55 to 90 30 with an average of 72 80 under water deficit condition table 6 under normal condition op 44 and op 49 showed the lower values of this component and families op 14 op 15 op 17 op 1 op 45 op 5 op 12 op 40 op 46 op 10 op 39 op 41 op 22 and op 42 had the higher values for this component under water deficit condition the lowest value of trans anethole was detected for op 44 other families had high and moderate values of it table 6 under normal condition the parental genotypes of families op 44 and op 49 and under water deficit parental genotype of op 44 had lower gcas for trans anethole and therefore are bad combiners while the parental genotypes of other families under normal and water deficit conditions had moderate to high gcas for this component and therefore are good combiners table 7 estragole varied considerably and ranged from 0 62 to 54 71 with an average of 12 43 under normal condition and from 1 91 to 60 50 with an average of 14 18 under water deficit condition families op 44 and op 25 had higher values of estragole under normal condition under water deficit family op 44 had the highest value of estragole table 6 under normal condition the parental genotypes of op 44 and op 25 and under water deficit parental genotype of op 44 had higher gcas respectively and therefore are good combiners for estragole table 7 under normal and water deficit conditions the highest value of fenchone was observed for op 49 table 6 the parental genotype of this family had highest value of gca and therefore is good combiner table 7 3 3 effect of water deficit and matting systems mean comparisons of all measured traits for the two moisture conditions in two separate populations are given in table 4 as expected water deficit strongly reduced seed yield per plant essential oil yield α pinene trans anethole and anisaldehyde while significantly increased β myrcene limonene γ terpinene fenchone and estragole in s1 and op populations compared with normal condition water deficit approximately reduced seed yield per plant by 61 and 58 in s1 and op populations respectively for essential oil yield these reductions were approximately 50 and 43 in the same populations relative to normal condition table 4 to assess drought tolerance of the fennel populations two selection indices of sti and ysi were calculated by using seed yield per plant sti syp and ysi syp and essential oil yield sti eoy and ysi eoy biplots of sti syp and ysi syp for s1 and op populations and distribution of selfed and open pollinated progenies are shown in fig 2a and b respectively based on the results in the s1 population the higher values of sti syp were observed for families 9 38 33 35 31 and 13 and the lower values were detected for families 43 46 37 44 49 and 5 respectively the higher values of ysi syp were obtained for families 2 13 41 33 and 27 and the lower values of this index were observed for families 4 43 5 44 and 8 respectively fig 2a in the op population the higher values of sti syp were observed for families 38 26 33 9 41 and 32 and the lower values were detected for families 15 25 17 1 24 and 10 respectively the higher values for ysi syp were obtained for families 13 38 31 7 and 30 and the lower values of this index were detected for families 25 10 17 1 and 22 respectively fig 2b compared with open pollination selfing reduced the mean performance of seed and essential oil yield α pinene β myrcene and limonene under normal condition and seed and essential oil yield β myrcene and limonene under water deficit condition demonstrating the effects of inbreeding on these traits however self pollination did not affect the remaining phytochemical components of essential oil significantly table 8 3 4 variance components and heritability the estimates of heritability and variance components were calculated for each moisture condition separately and are presented in table 9 under both moisture conditions moderate to high values of heritability were estimated for all traits in both populations except for seed yield per plant in s1 population and seed yield per plant and limonene in op one results revealed that in the s1 population heritability estimates fluctuated from 44 71 for seed yield per plant to 74 40 for limonene under normal condition and from 39 25 for seed yield per plant to 67 79 for β myrcene under water deficit condition in the op population it ranged from 47 24 for limonene to 69 27 for trans anethole in normal condition and from 31 09 for limonene to 77 81 for estragole in water deficit condition table 9 results also showed that for all traits and in both populations higher heritability estimates were observed under normal condition than water deficit moreover for some of the evaluated traits such as γ terpinene fenchone estragole and trans anethole heritability estimates were higher in the op population than in the s1 one while limonene and β myrcene had higher heritability estimates in the s1 population than in op one table 9 3 5 association among traits and biplot analysis phenotypic correlation coefficients between different traits for s1 and op populations are given in tables 10 and 11 in the s1 population seed yield per plant was positively correlated with essential oil yield β myrcene sti syp and sti eoy under normal condition while under water deficit condition had positive correlations with essential oil yield ysi syp sti syp and sti eoy table 10 in the op population under normal condition seed yield per plant had significant and positive correlations with essential oil yield β myrcene anisaldehyde sti syp and sti eoy while under water deficit condition it was positively associated with essential oil yield β myrcene limonene anisaldehyde ysi syp ysi eoy sti syp and sti eoy and negatively associated with trans anethole table 11 in the s1 population essential oil yield showed positive correlations with seed yield per plant α pinene β myrcene estragole sti syp and sti eoy under normal condition while under water deficit it was positively associated with seed yield per plant limonene fenchone ysi syp sti syp and sti eoy table 10 moreover in the op population this trait showed positive associations with seed yield per plant β myrcene γ terpinene anisaldehyde sti syp and sti eoy under normal condition and with seed yield per plant β myrcene limonene anisaldehyde ysi syp sti syp ysi eoy and sti eoy under water deficit table 11 among the phytochemical constituents of essential oil β myrcene was positively associated with seed yield per plant essential oil yield limonene fenchone sti syp and sti eoy under normal and water deficit conditions in the op population and under normal condition in s1 one under normal and water deficit conditions γ terpinene had significant and positive correlation with anisaldehyde in s1 population while in op population there was significant and negative association between these two constituents of essential oil moreover in s1 population trans anethole had significant and negative associations with fenchone estragole and anisaldehyde under normal condition and with estragole under water deficit while in the op population this constituent was negatively correlated with β myrcene fenchone estragole and anisaldehyde under normal condition and with seed yield per plant β myrcene fenchone estragole ysi syp and ysi eoy under water deficit tables 10 and 11 in both s1 and op populations principal component analysis was performed based on all measured traits under normal and water deficit conditions it was shown that in the s1 population the first two principal components explained more than 48 and 51 of the total variation incorporated in the data under the normal and water deficit conditions respectively fig 3a and b under normal condition fig 3a the first principal component pc1 was positively correlated with seed yield per plant essential oil yield β myrcene estragole sti syp and sti eoy hence this component was considered as productivity essential oil constituents and drought tolerance component principal component 2 pc2 which had positive correlations with fenchone estragole and anisaldehyde and was negatively associated with trans anethole was considered to represent the essential oil constituents selection of families with high values of pc1 and pc2 would improve productivity drought tolerance and essential oil components of this species in this respect family 35 was the superior one fig 3a under water deficit fig 3b pc1 had positive correlations with seed yield per plant essential oil yield fenchone ysi syp sti syp and sti eoy therefore it was considered to be the productivity and drought tolerance component the second component pc2 was positively correlated with limonene and trans anethole and negatively associated with estragole therefore it was named essential oil constituents selection of families with high values of pc1 and pc2 i e families 9 33 and 35 would improve productivity phytochemical constituents of essential oil and drought tolerance of studied germplasm results of pca in the op population showed that the first two components justified 27 55 and 18 57 of the total variation under normal condition and 35 90 and 16 77 under water deficit condition respectively figs 3c and 3d under normal condition fig 3c pc1 had positive correlations with seed yield essential oil yield sti syp and sti eoy and therefore was considered as the drought tolerance and essential oil productivity on the other hand pc2 had positive correlations with limonene estragole ysi syp and ysi eoy and negative correlation with trans anethole fig 3c hence it was called yield stability and essential oil constituents thus improvement in productivity yield stability essential oil components and drought tolerance of fennel can be obtained by selecting families with high in pc1 and pc2 in this respect families 1 8 13 14 and 15 were the superior ones having high productivity yield stability and essential oil components and were drought tolerant in contrast families 4 7 22 27 and 39 had low productivity yield stability and essential oil components and were identified as drought sensitive ones fig 3c under water deficit fig 3d pc1 had positive correlations with seed yield essential oil yield ysi syp sti syp ysi eoy and sti eoy and negative association with trans anethole therefore it was named productivity drought tolerance and yield stability moreover pc2 had positive correlations with β myrcene and estragole and negative associations with trans anethole anisaldehyde and sti eoy therefore it was considered to represent the drought tolerance and essential oil constituents of fennel selection based on high values of pc1 and pc2 can lead to improvement of drought tolerance and essential oil production of fennel in this respect families 8 33 and 38 were the superior ones 4 discussion devising and implementing breeding programs for each species depends on the reproductive system and information about the genetic variation and genetic control of traits this information helps scientists to find new strategies to cope with abiotic stresses especially drought in the medicinal plants here we developed two different genetic populations of selfed and open pollinated in fennel to evaluate the effects of selfing and open pollination on the productivity and essential oil components of fennel in different moisture environments screen drought tolerant families and estimate genetic parameters significant differences were observed among families and between the two moisture environments for all measured traits suggesting that there is considerable genotypic variation among these families studied at both normal and water deficit conditions due to the wide range of genotypic geographical origins the presence of a high level of variability in collected entries is expected and was in agreement with the results obtained by sengupta et al 2014 the family by moisture environment f e interaction was significant for most of the evaluated traits demonstrating that the relative performance of the families was not static and changed across the two moisture environments which was in agreement with the report of parmoon et al 2022 wide genetic variation observed for the studied traits is promising for genetic gain through selection in this germplasm moreover the gcv values for most of the evaluated traits were higher under the normal condition than water deficit indicating that water deficit reduced the genetic variation of these traits blum 2011 has reported that the rate of genetic advance through selection is usually higher under normal condition the importance of fennel as a medicinal and spice plant and its agricultural importance has arisen the need to improve the composition of commercial fennel fruits pank et al 2003 gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis revealed the presence of eight major chemicals in our germplasm results revealed that the content and chemical composition of essential oil is very variable in different families cosge et al 2008 also reported significant differences in essential oil composition between different varieties of f vulgare ssp capillaceum napoli et al 2010 reported that the fennel essential oil variation can be related to the geographical origins and ecological situations related to the climatic conditions of the growing localities moreover trans anethole estragole fenchone and limonene were found to be the main constituents of essential oil in this germplasm similar to our results in the studies of napoli et al 2010 zheljazkov et al 2013 and cosge et al 2008 trans anethole estragole limonene and fenchone were also reported as the main components of essential oil in fennel the ability of plants to tolerate water deficit condition is critical for plant productivity all over the world in the present study water deficit caused a drastic reduction in seed yield per plant in both s1 and op populations which is evidently due to inadequate photosynthesis owing to stomata closure in response to low soil moisture and consequently limited carbon dioxide uptake fahad et al 2017 khodadadi et al 2018 and parmoon et al 2022 also reported that the seed yield and quality including aromatic oil content of fennel seeds were reduced by drought stress during seed development similarly water deficit caused a large decrease in seed yield of caraway carum carvi l laribi et al 2009 and cumin cuminum cyminum l rebey et al 2012 under water deficit even though the percentage of essential oil was increased the essential oil yield was decreased significantly considering that the essential oil yield is obtained from the product of the seed yield and the percentage of essential oil it can be concluded that the decrease in essential oil yield under water deficit condition was due to the reduction of grain yield a decrease in essential oil yield with the decrease in the amount of irrigation water has also been reported in other plants i e ardakani et al 2007 bettaieb et al 2011 also reported that although moisture stress increased the percentage of cumin essential oil but due to the decrease in seed yield under water deficit the yield of essential oil was decreased significantly in this condition compared to full irrigation treatment moreover water deficit significantly decreased α pinene trans anethole and anisaldehyde while it significantly increased β myrcene limonene γ terpinene fenchone and estragole in the s1 and op populations the development of genotypes with high yield under normal condition and smaller yield reduction under water deficit is the main purpose of breeding for drought tolerance selection indices such as sti can distinguish these tolerant genotypes from others fernandez 1992 in this study several families were identified with higher values of sti from both populations families 9 13 31 33 35 and 38 in the s1 population and families 2 13 27 33 and 41 in the op population these families seem to have a higher yield potential under water deficit condition and may be further improved by crossing to families having higher values of ysi i e families 9 26 32 33 38 and 41 in the s1 population and families 7 13 30 31 and 38 in the op population that were stable under both moisture conditions the s1 progenies had lower seed productivity essential oil yield β myrcene and limonene than did the op progenies under both moisture conditions which can be related to the inbreeding depression effects inbreeding changes the mean phenotypes in a way that usually leads to a decrease in fitness this reduction in fitness is commonly thought to result from increased genetic homozygosity associated with inbreeding either through increased expression of deleterious recessive alleles or loss of overdominant allele combinations charlesworth and charlesworth 1987 however there were no significant differences between s1 and op progenies in terms of γ terpinene fenchone estragole trans anethole and anisaldehyde the lack of significant differences between s1 and op for some characters evaluated in this study suggests low heterosis for these traits estimation of heritability is an important purpose of genetic study of traits in the breeding programs because it can determine the influence of environmental and genetic factors on the traits of interest for assessing the efficiency of selection and provides early information for designing an effective breeding program to maximize genetic gain through selection hallauer et al 2010 as stated earlier the variance among half sib families primarily represents additive genetic variance incorporated in phenotypic variance therefore the heritability value of op population represents an estimation of narrow sense heritability h2 n nguyen and sleper 1983 meanwhile in the s1 population the variance among the family means represents additive and non additive genetic variance incorporated in the phenotypic variance therefore the heritability value of this population is an estimation of broad sense heritability results revealed that in the s1 progenies moderate to high values of broad sense heritability were obtained for all traits except for seed yield per plant under normal and water deficit conditions indicating that these traits were less affected by the environment and direct selection for these traits would be effective for further improvement meena et al 2019 in the op population the narrow sense heritability estimates were moderate to high for all traits under both moisture conditions with the exception of seed yield per plant and limonene indicating that a large part of the total genetic variation was additive and recurrent or mass selection would likely be successful for their improvement yadav et al 2012 also reported low heritability estimates for seed yield in fennel which is in agreement with the results of the present study however no literature was found on the heritability of phytochemical constituents of essential oil especially in the s1 and op progenies moreover for all of the studied traits the estimates of heritability were higher under normal condition than water deficit this may be due to the fact that environmental changes can induce the change of gene expression and genetic variation of these traits which can adjust the regulation of plant growth and metabolism to the new environment rumbaugh et al 1984 the correlation coefficient as an important statistical parameter is of interest to anticipate how the selection pressure exerted on one trait will affect the other traits results of correlation coefficients and pca analysis indicated that seed yield per plant and essential oil yield had significant and positive correlations with sti syp and sti eoy under normal and water deficit conditions in both populations these correlations indicate that the more drought tolerant families have also more seed productivity and essential oil yield in the s1 population seed yield per plant and essential oil yield were positively associated with β myrcene and α pinene under normal condition and with limonene and fenchone under water deficit while in the op population seed yield per plant and essential oil yield had significant and positive associations with β myrcene and anisaldehyde under normal condition and with β myrcene anisaldehyde and limonene under water deficit condition these relationships were verified by the pca method and indicated that any increase in these constituents might be associated with the increase of seed production and essential oil and vice versa these results also showed that water deficit has changed the relationships between different traits results also revealed that in the s1 population trans anethole was negatively associated with fenchone and anisaldehyde under normal condition moreover in this population trans anethole and estragole had significant and negative association under normal and water deficit conditions in the op population trans anethole was negatively correlated with β myrcene fenchone and estragole and also γ terpinene and anisaldehyde were negatively associated under both conditions under normal condition anisaldehyde had significant and negative associations with β myrcene limonene and trans anethole these negative associations between essential oil components indicate that some of these components are isomers and this relationship can limit the simultaneous selection of several components for example telci et al 2009 stated that trans anethole is an isomer of fenchone with the only position of the double bond of the propenyl chain gross et al 2009 and raal et al 2011 reported negative correlation between trans anethole and estragole which are generally in agreement with our findings and it is stated that these two components may have a common biosynthetic precursor gross et al 2009 in conclusion high genetic variation observed between and within the studied populations highlighted the fact that any change in mating system could clearly change the genetic structure of germplasm results revealed that the main constituents of fennel essential oil were trans anethole estragole fenchone and limonene most of which have significant bioactivities the results of the current study provide for the first time the data on the simultaneous effect of inbreeding and water deficit on the secondary metabolites of different fennel populations selfing led to decrease in seed productivity essential oil yield β myrcene and limonene of fennel families water deficit caused substantial reductions in seed yield essential oil yield α pinene trans anethole and anisaldehyde and therefore reduced genotypic variation of them results also showed that water deficit changed the relationships between different traits because of the moderately low heritability for seed yield both genetic and non genetic effects played a role in controlling this trait therefore selection based on an index which is a weighted linear combination of several traits may be more effective for the improvement of seed yield per plant in recurrent selection programs moreover there were significant associations between some essential oil components which can be useful for indirect selection evaluation of families through sti and ysi allowed the identification of drought tolerant and stable families in the studied germplasm based on the sti and multivariate analyses parental genotypes of families 9 13 33 and 35 from the s1 population and 8 13 33 and 38 from op one were identified as the superior genotypes they had higher seed production essential oil content yield stability and drought tolerance and therefore can be recommended to use in the future breeding programs future studies should focus on evaluating the effects of other abiotic stresses agronomic conditions and harvest time on phytochemical constituents of the essential oil of fennel moreover evaluation of essential oil composition of self pollinated genotypes of fennel in the next generations can be suggested for the future breeding programs in fennel funding this research did not receive

crop root systems in different soil layers hence understanding root distribution soil water and heat dynamics is essential to improve water and nutrient use efficiency a case study of tomato grown in a greenhouse with drip irrigation was conducted to test an improved two dimensional 2d model namely uzflow 2d for simulating the soil water and heat dynamics the performance of uzflow 2d model was also compared with the well known hydrus 2d model a 2d root length density rld function as a main subsidiary model of uzflow 2d was proposed by investigating the roots distribution from lateral and radial latitudes at the four main growth stages seedling flowering fruit setting and picking experimental data in 2015 was used to calibrate the parameters of uzflow 2d and hydrus 2d models and validated using the data of 2016 results showed that more than 70 of the total rld was concentrated in soil layers of 0 20 cm during the seedling 0 40 cm during the flowering and 0 60 cm during the fruit setting and picking stages the 2d rld function perform well for locations within and between two rows with determination coefficients higher than 0 77 both uzflow 2d and hydrus 2d models perform well in simulating soil water and soil temperature dynamics while uzflow 2d model produced improved accuracy in modeling the soil water and heat dynamics within and between two rows of drip irrigated tomato plants the overall root mean square error rmse was 0 008 cm3 cm 3 for soil water contents and 0 434 c for soil temperature for uzflow 2d model however the overall rmse was 0 012 cm3 cm 3 for soil water contents and 0 504 c for soil temperature for hydrus 2d model hence the uzflow 2d model can be served as an alternatively useful tool to simulate water and heat dynamics keywords drip irrigation greenhouse tomato hydrus 2d model root length density soil water and temperature uzflow 2d model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction to enhance immunity and reduce the risk of chronical diseases high quality vegetables are continually the goal that human pursue in china green and efficient production of greenhouse tomatoes provides local residents with nutritious and healthy food while also drives the development of local economy planting area of greenhouses in 2019 has exceeded 270 000 ha according to the data released by ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic irrigation is the only source of water in greenhouses as an efficient water saving irrigation technology drip irrigation is already mainstream in greenhouse water supplemental systems drip irrigation system can deliver water and fertilizer to crop root zone in a timely and appropriate amount according to water demand of crops therefore providing trade off between crop yield and quality li et al 2021 for greenhouse grown crops soil physical chemical and biological processes are influence by soil water and temperature conditions which depend greatly on crop root systems in different soil layers li et al 2015 thus understanding root distribution soil water and heat dynamics is essential to improve water and nutrient use efficiency crop roots are mainly distributed in shallower soil layers under surface drip irrigation for example shan et al 2016 indicated that more about 85 of tomato root length density rld were distributed in the top 20 cm soil layer which was the main factor affecting water distribution zotarelli et al 2009 reported that 70 75 of tomato rld was concentrated in the 0 15 cm soil layer under surface drip irrigation delgoda et al 2016 found that rld was the most suitable parameter for describing water uptake characteristics of plant roots clearly root distribution characteristics in the upper soil should be significantly considered when establishing root water uptake model of drip irrigated crops however the structure of root systems is complex and uncertain because roots usually grow beneath soil surface making root measurement more difficult and low accuracy li et al 2015 therefore analyzing rld distribution characteristics and developing a root water uptake model is of great significance for understanding soil water dynamics tomato rld from both lateral and radial latitudes were analyzed by qiu et al 2017 under furrow irrigation at the late stage and verified the reliability of this method however the 2d rld distribution function at different growth stages were not established which may lead to errors in modeling soil water dynamics furthermore the infiltration mode of drip irrigation however is different from furrow irrigation especially for different soil water distribution in the current commonly used measurement approaches direct field measurements of water and heat dynamics are laborious and time consuming phogat et al 2013 therefore the simulation models have become a valuable tool for studying the complex interaction process of water and heat in the soil profile and evaluating impact of management measures on crop yields and environment li and ma 2003 in fact models have proven to be particularly useful in describing and predicting transportation processes and simulating conditions that are economically or technically impossible to carry out in field trials many soil water and heat dynamic models have been applied in field conditions zhou et al 2007 šimůnek et al 2006 mmolawa and or 2003 elmaloglou and malamos 2003 among these models hydrus 2d is a well known software package that can realize axisymmetric water heat flow šimůnek et al 2006 and because of its graphical and easy to use interface many studies have successfully simulated soil water dynamics under drip irrigation conditions for example skaggs et al 2004 showed that predictions of soil water content distribution by hydrus 2d agreed well with measured data at different irrigation amounts and irrigation durations 20 40 and 60 l m 1 of applied water dabach 2013 and 2015 compared hydrus 2d simulations with experimental data under drip irrigation and optimized irrigation threshold to improve water use efficiency mmolawa and or 2003 compared the hydrus 2d model and analytical solution of soil water dynamics model in absence and presence of plants in the hydrus 2d model two assumptions cannot be neglected 1 soil evaporation was similar everywhere on soil surface and 2 root water uptake was calculated by introducing a non uniform distribution of potential rise rates over an arbitrarily shaped root zone vogel 1987 however for tomatoes grown in greenhouses methods for calculating plant transpiration i e root water uptake and soil evaporation are different from method by campbell and norman 1989 provided in the hydrus 2d another key point to consider is that the rld function at different growth stages may be discrepant which requires establishment of the 2d rld function and acquisition of regression parameters for each growth stages therefore the assumptions may lead to simulation errors as we considered under greenhouse with drip irrigation conditions in addition finite element method was used to divide computational grid in hydrus 2d while we believe that hybrid finite difference method may make the results more accurate when considering soil void structure and boundary division this is attributed to the fact that concept of series to discretize the continuous function is used in finite difference method while finite element method uses the interpolation principle to approximate the solution of the domain so it can only obtain the values at different points on the macro level furthermore the code of hydrus 2d was not available to the public which also limits researchers for improving the model based on this an improved soil hydrothermal dynamic model with code available to the public was developed for improving the accuracy of soil water and heat simulation in greenhouses under drip irrigation conditions the main objectives of this work were 1 to analyze the rld distribution of greenhouse grown tomato from multiple locations under drip irrigation 2 to develop a uzflow 2d model and compare with hydrus 2d in simulating soil water and heat dynamics 2 information of two numerical models 2 1 uzflow 2d model fortran package is used in uzflow 2d model to calculate the movement of unsaturated soil water flow hybrid finite difference implicit schemes of soil water potential content are employed to establish numerical equation of soil water flow to ensure convergence and stability of solution in equations iteration method is adopted to solve linear equations uzflow 2d model includes several basic modules e g unit water flow upper and lower boundary evapotranspiration irrigation observation value equation group solving and irrigation forecasting module this model can simulate soil water flux under different boundary conditions such as soil water potential water content soil evaporation crop transpiration root water uptake and potential evaporation hence uzflow 2d model can be used to simulate soil water and heat dynamics and a detailed flow chart was made for the operation of uzflow 2d model to facilitate readers to further understand the model development calibration data used results and calculation process fig a1 2 1 1 establishment of soil water heat transfer model assuming

we determined the parameters of 2d rld distribution function for the four different growth stages respectively potential water uptake rate of crop roots at different levels of soil profile can be calculated based on root distribution function and potential evapotranspiration the 2d root water uptake model is calculated by the feddes model feddes et al 1974 which includes rld distribution and soil water potential in root layer 10 s p r z t σ h l z w p 11 σ h 0 h h 4 h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 4 h h 3 1 h 3 h h 2 h 1 h h 1 h 2 h 2 h h 1 0 h h 1 where l z is normalized root water uptake distribution

values of soil matrix potential cm respectively root water uptake rate reached the maximum when h is between h 3 and h 2 linear variation of root water uptake rate with h when h is between h 4 and h 3 when soil matrix potential reached h 1 and h 4 root water uptake rate is 0 referring to the results given by feddes et al 1974 h 1 h 2 and h 3 are taken as 50 cm 400 cm 1 500 cm respectively 2 1 3 calibration of soil hydraulic and thermal properties soil hydraulic and thermal properties parameters of uzflow 2d model were calibrated using 2015 data the van genuchten functions van genuchten et al 1998 was used to describe soil hydraulic properties as 12 s e h θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h n m m 1 1 n 13 k θ k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where s e is relative saturation θ s is saturated water content cm3

presented in table 1 soil thermal conductivity was calibrated using the improved côté konrad 2005 and lu et al 2006 models the detailed calculation method can be found in su et al 2016 calibrating soil heat capacity using the calculation method proposed by de vries de vries 1958 given as follows 14 c v 1 92 1 θ s 4 18 θ where θ is volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 2 1 4 calculation of potential evaporation and transpiration potential evaporation e s and potential transpiration e p are calculated on a daily basis based on an improved dual crop coefficient method gong et al 2020 in this approach evapotranspiration is estimated using the following equation 15 et k cb k e et o 16 e p k cb et o 17 e s k e et o where et is evapotranspiration k cb is basal crop coefficient and k e is

to solve equation parameters the finite difference formula of soil water flow movement is constructed according to the continuity equation of soil water flow movement according to the continuity equation difference between inflow and outflow soil unit water content is equal to the change in unit s water content when soil water density is a constant thus continuity equation can be expressed as follows allen and murphy 1985 18 q i 1 2 j q i 1 2 j q i j 1 2 q i j 1 2 w i j δ θ i j δ t δ z i δ x j where qi 1 2 j qi 1 2 j qi j 1 2 qi j 1 2 are units flowing into or out of soil within δt i j dimension of the water is l t w i j is source sink water l t this study mainly refers to water absorption of crop roots δθ i j is change in soil volumetric water content within δt δz i and δx j are

described by the following formula 19 q i 1 2 j k i 1 2 j δ x j δ z i 1 2 h i 1 j h i j k i 1 2 j δ x j similarly calculation formula for amount of water flowing into i j from soil unit i 1 j is 20 q

i j 1 2 δ z i h i j 1 h i j δ x j 1 2 k i j 1 2 δ z i δ x j 1 2 h i j 1 h i j combining eq 18 22 can get the finite difference equation of soil water flow movement as follows 23 k i 1 2 j δ x j δ z i 1 2 h i 1 j h i j k i 1 2 j δ x j k i 1 2 j δ x j δ z i 1 2 h i 1 j h i j k i 1 2 j δ x j k i j 1 2 δ z i δ x j 1 2 h i j 1 h i j k i j 1 2 δ z i δ x j 1 2 h i j 1 h i j w i j δ θ i j δ t δ z i δ x j due to nonlinear relationship among soil water movement parameters soil matrix potential and volumetric water content convergence of difference scheme and stability of solution must be considered to solve the above equations in this study the implicit iterative format h and the θ mixed finite difference equation are used to replace the eq 23 as 24 k i 1 2 j p 1 k δ x j δ t δ z i 1 2 h i 1 j p 1 k

heat capacity c v are closely related to soil water content hence the finite difference method is used to solve eq 2 as 25 c i j 1 t i j 1 t i j δ t j δ z i λ i 1 2 j 1 2 t i 1 j 1 t i j 1 δ z u λ i 1 2 j 1 2 t i j 1 t i 1 j 1 δ z ℓ where the superscript j is time level and the subscript i is number of nodes δz u z i 1 z i and δz l z i z i 1 since k h and c v are not affected by soil temperature itself the eq 25 can be expressed as a linear equation 2 2 hydrus 2d model hydrus 2d is a computer program that simulates 2d soil water and heat dynamics šimůnek et al 2006 which is based on solving the richards equation numerically using finite element scheme with the same equations as 1 and 2 2 2 1 hydraulic parameters and thermal properties the computer program retention curve program for unsaturated soils van genuchten et al 1998 estimations from the rosetta neural network model and observed soil physical properties were used to determine soil hydraulic parameters in greenhouse soil

and picking stages these values slightly differ from results of zotarelli et al 2009 who reported that 51 78 of tomato rld under drip irrigation was concentrated in the soil layer within 15 cm during the reproductive phase while under furrow irrigation more than 81 of total rld was concentrated in the soil layer within 50 cm during the picking stage qiu et al 2017 these differences may be related to tomato planting conditions and soil water content in the root zone in terms of horizontal distribution rld decreased as horizontal distance from the origin position of plant p1 increased average rld at p1 was 7 8 88 3 20 5 83 5 7 6 88 9 and 6 7 76 1 higher than other positions at the seedling flowering fruit setting and picking stages respectively the maximum rld at different stages always appeared in 20 cm soil layer where the maximum value 1 2 cm cm 3 occurred at the fruit setting stage fig 2c2 the rld below 60 cm soil layer was relatively small and generally did not exceed 0 4 cm cm 3 this phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that water was mainly concentrated in the upper layer above 40 cm under drip irrigation while plant root system were water oriented jha et al 2017 average vertical rld for each soil layer was obtained by calculating the average values of two directions i e within and between two rows relative vertical rlds at different growth stages can be well fitted as exponential functions of relative root depth table 4 with the r 2 above 0 76 33 l r z a 1 l max e b 1 z z max where l r z is vertical rld cm cm 3 a 1 and b 1 are fitting coefficients l max is maximum rld cm cm 3 0 82 0 94 1 00 and 0 90 cm cm 3 for the seedling flowering fruit setting and picking stages z is soil depth cm z max is the maximum root growth depth cm 40 60 80 and 100 cm for seedling flowering fruit setting and picking stages respectively the function was similar to other crops such as grape vines zhou et al 2007 trees vrugt et al 2001 and tomato under furrow irrigation qiu et al 2017 the rld on x and y axes was expressed by using radial distance of relative main root p1 and relative rld fig 1 relative rld on x and y directions can also be fitted as an exponential functions of relative root depth table 4 with the r 2 of 0 63 0 89 34 l r z a 2 l max e b 2 y y max 35 l r z a 3 l max e b 3 x x max where l r z is vertical rld cm cm 3 a 2 b 2 a 3 and b 3 are fitting coefficients l max is the maximum rld cm cm 3 0 48 0 58 0 64 and 0 58 cm cm 3 for seedling flowering fruit setting and picking stages x and y is distance relative to p1 x max and y max is the middle of between and within two neighboring rows 18 and 12 cm respectively tomato rld distribution in direction of plant spacing and row spacing were similar thus 2d rld distribution changing along the vertical and horizontal radial directions can be obtained by averaging the measured data at different depths and different distances from circumference of plant besides tomato root density decayed exponentially in both vertical and radial directions referring to eqs 33 35 therefore tomato 2d rld distribution function was obtained after fitting the measured rld by the following formula 36 ρ r z ρ 0 exp δ r r m v z z m where r and z are horizontal and vertical distances from the p1 respectively cm r m and z m are the maximum horizontal length and vertical depth with values of 18 and 100 cm respectively ρ o δ ν are regression coefficients and the values at the four growth stages are shown in table 5 which was calibrated based on the data of 2015 the reliability of the 2d rld distribution function was then verified with the data of 2016 as shown in fig a3 some studies have also produced similar functions such as furrow irrigated tomato grown in greenhouse qiu et al 2017 and drip irrigated grape vines in field condition zhou et al 2007 3 2 evaluation of uzflow 2d and compared with hydrus 2d 3 2 1 performance in simulating soil water content fig 3 shows the comparison of swcs between simulated by two models uzflow 2d and hydrus 2d and measured by ech2o sensors in the soil depth of 10 20 30 40 and 60 cm the simulated values of both models are basically consistent with the measurements and uzflow 2d produced better accuracy than hydrus 2d especially at deep soil layer performance of uzflow 2d within rows was better than between rows the mean values of b 0 r 2 rmse rsr and ef within two rows in all locations were 1 00 0 90 0 006 cm3 cm 3 0 62 and 0 86 respectively likewise they were 1 01 0 83 0 009 cm3 cm 3 0 45 and 0 79 respectively between rows table 6 however hydrus 2d did not show a similar pattern in simulation swcs within and between rows at different soil layers discrepancies were greater in the upper soil layers 10 20 and 30 cm than in the deeper layers 40 and 60 cm which can be attributed to the fact that upper swcs was subject to irrigation and evaporation qiu et al 2017 skaggs et al 2004 vrugt et al 2001 our result was similar to the finding by qiu et al 2017 who simulated soil water dynamics of furrow irrigated tomato in a greenhouse by hydrus 2d skaggs et al 2004 also indicated that rmse of the simulated and measured swcs were in range of 0 02 0 04 cm3 cm 3 using hydrus 2d which was slightly worse than the performance of uzflow 2d in addition tomato root system showed an exponential function with soil depth with high rld in the upper soil layer which also influence the distribution of swcs in the upper soil layer and would likewise lead to lower simulation accuracy in the upper soil layer than in the deep soil layer vrugt et al 2001 indicated that effect of rld should be mainly considered when simulating soil water dynamics therefore fully considering the root water uptake was the key to improve the performance of uzflow 2d in simulating swcs after irrigation swcs increased quickly especially in the 0 20 cm layers to further verify the accuracy of uzflow 2d after irrigation swcs at three points p1 p2 p3 were texted within three days after irrigation and compared with hydrus 2d fig 4 results showed that the observations were uniformly distributed in vicinity of the simulated line and simulation in deeper soil layer 40 and 60 cm were better than upper layer 10 20 and 30 cm swcs above 20 cm increased rapidly after irrigation with an inflection point near 20 cm which may be due to large water lost above this soil layer before irrigation comparing the three simulation points we found that simulated accuracy in the p1 was better than p2 and p3 especially on the first day after irrigation with b 0 r 2 rmse rsr and ef of 1 00 0 95 0 003 cm3 cm 3 0 230 and 0 95 performance of uzflow 2d at the three points was also better than hydrus 2d from the first day to the third day after irrigation table 6 the above results indicate that both models perform well in simulating swc dynamic under drip irrigation but uzflow 2d is superior to hydrus 2d either after irrigation or over the whole growth stages these differences may result from the following reason 1 tomato roots under drip irrigation mainly distributed at soil layer of 0 60 cm and 2d rld were different in the soil layer at four growth stages the 2d rld functions in uzflow 2d can be set by itself according to the root growth conditions at different growth stages due to the open source which improves the simulation accuracy 2 the calculation methods of potential evaporation and potential transpiration of drip irrigated tomato are constructed according to the special environment of the greenhouse and then embedded into uzflow 2d to further improve the performance 3 under drip irrigation the swcs below 60 cm soil layer are relatively stable under a given flow rate wang et al 2009 which attribute to the fact that soil structure of the soil above 60 cm below the ground surface is too tight to penetrate the roots hence the finite difference method was used in uzflow 2d which was also the key to improve simulation accuracy therefore uzflow 2d can be used an effective tool to simulate swcs dynamic for greenhouse tomato with drip irrigation however the interactive interface of uzflow 2d has not been developed and classic cases have not been tested which is kept for a future study 3 2 2 performance in simulating soil temperature fig 5 shows the simulation results of sts at 0 5 10 and 20 cm within and between rows by uzflow 2d and hydrus 2d models the simulation values were in good agreement with the measurements at each soil depths simulation precision was also better in the upper layer 0 and 5 cm than the lower layer 10 and 20 cm and within rows than between rows the performance of uzflow 2d and hydrus 2d are comparable in simulating sts for uzflow 2d b 0 ranged from 0 98 to 1 01 r 2 was above 0 97 rmse and rsr were below 0 523 c and 0 235 and ef was higher than 0 95 average relative deviation at 0 5 10 and 20 cm soil layers were 1 0 0 37 0 21 and 0 09 within rows and 0 47 2 89 0 33 and 1 65 between two rows we believe that calibrating the thermal conductivity was the key to improve the performance of uzflow 2d in simulating sts lu et al 2007 and su et al 2016 also reported that soil thermal conductivity needs to be calibrated with swcs therefore the prerequisite to improve the accuracy of st simulation is to accurately obtain the changes of swcs 4 conclusions in this study we proposed a soil water and heat transport model namely uzflow 2d model and compared with the well known hydrus 2d model both models were tested for drip irrigated tomato grown in a greenhouse root length density function is an important parameter in uzflow 2d model we established a 2d root length density distribution function for different growth stages after analyzing the lateral and radial latitudes distribution characteristics of root length density on drip irrigation tomatoes which can be well fitted by an exponential function with r 2 0 77 for different growth stages uzflow 2d provided reasonable accuracy in simulating soil water content between and within two rows as well as after irrigation in addition uzflow 2d provided a good performance in simulating soil temperature between and within two rows with r 2 0 97 and rmse 0 53 c compared to hydrus 2d uzflow 2d slightly improved the accuracy for simulating soil water content and soil temperature therefore the developed uzflow 2d model can be used as a useful tool to simulate soil water and heat dynamics especially in greenhouses under drip irrigation our results are crucial to further study the response of crop root

crop root systems in different soil layers hence understanding root distribution soil water and heat dynamics is essential to improve water and nutrient use efficiency a case study of tomato grown in a greenhouse with drip irrigation was conducted to test an improved two dimensional 2d model namely uzflow 2d for simulating the soil water and heat dynamics the performance of uzflow 2d model was also compared with the well known hydrus 2d model a 2d root length density rld function as a main subsidiary model of uzflow 2d was proposed by investigating the roots distribution from lateral and radial latitudes at the four main growth stages seedling flowering fruit setting and picking experimental data in 2015 was used to calibrate the parameters of uzflow 2d and hydrus 2d models and validated using the data of 2016 results showed that more than 70 of the total rld was concentrated in soil layers of 0 20 cm during the seedling 0 40 cm during the flowering and 0 60 cm during the fruit setting and picking stages the 2d rld function perform well for locations within and between two rows with determination coefficients higher than 0 77 both uzflow 2d and hydrus 2d models perform well in simulating soil water and soil temperature dynamics while uzflow 2d model produced improved accuracy in modeling the soil water and heat dynamics within and between two rows of drip irrigated tomato plants the overall root mean square error rmse was 0 008 cm3 cm 3 for soil water contents and 0 434 c for soil temperature for uzflow 2d model however the overall rmse was 0 012 cm3 cm 3 for soil water contents and 0 504 c for soil temperature for hydrus 2d model hence the uzflow 2d model can be served as an alternatively useful tool to simulate water and heat dynamics keywords drip

and reduce the risk of chronical diseases high quality vegetables are continually the goal that human pursue in china green and efficient production of greenhouse tomatoes provides local residents with nutritious and healthy food while also drives the development of local economy planting area of greenhouses in 2019 has exceeded 270 000 ha according to the data released by ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic irrigation is the only source of water in greenhouses as an efficient water saving irrigation technology drip irrigation is already mainstream in greenhouse water supplemental systems drip irrigation system can deliver water and fertilizer to crop root zone in a timely and appropriate amount according to water demand of crops therefore providing trade off between crop yield and quality li et al 2021 for greenhouse grown crops soil physical chemical and biological processes are influence by soil water and temperature conditions which depend greatly on crop root systems in different soil layers li et al 2015 thus understanding root distribution soil water and heat dynamics is essential to improve water and nutrient use efficiency crop roots are mainly distributed in shallower soil layers under surface drip irrigation for example shan et al 2016 indicated that more about 85 of tomato root length density rld were distributed in the top 20 cm soil layer which was the main factor affecting water distribution zotarelli et al 2009 reported that 70 75 of tomato rld was concentrated in the 0 15 cm soil layer under surface drip irrigation delgoda et al 2016 found that rld was the most suitable parameter for describing water uptake characteristics of plant roots clearly root distribution characteristics in the upper soil should be significantly considered when establishing root water uptake model of drip irrigated crops however the structure of root systems is complex and uncertain because roots usually grow beneath soil surface making root measurement more difficult and low accuracy li et al 2015 therefore analyzing rld distribution characteristics and developing a root water uptake model is of great significance for understanding soil water dynamics tomato rld from both lateral and radial latitudes were analyzed by qiu et al 2017 under furrow irrigation at the late stage and verified the reliability of this method however the 2d rld distribution function at different growth stages were not established which may lead to errors in modeling soil water dynamics furthermore the infiltration mode of drip irrigation however is different from furrow irrigation especially for different soil water distribution in the current commonly used measurement approaches direct field measurements of water and heat dynamics are laborious and time consuming phogat et al 2013 therefore the simulation models have become a valuable tool for studying the complex interaction process of water and heat in the soil profile and evaluating impact of management measures on crop yields and environment li and ma 2003 in fact models have proven to be particularly useful in describing and predicting transportation processes and simulating conditions that are economically or technically impossible to carry out in field trials many soil water and heat dynamic models have been applied in field conditions zhou et al 2007 šimůnek et al 2006 mmolawa and or 2003 elmaloglou and malamos 2003 among these models hydrus 2d is a well known software package that can realize axisymmetric water heat flow šimůnek et al 2006 and because of its graphical and easy to use interface many studies have successfully simulated soil water dynamics under drip irrigation conditions for example skaggs et al 2004 showed that predictions of soil water content distribution by hydrus 2d agreed well with measured data at different irrigation amounts and irrigation durations 20 40 and 60 l m 1 of applied water dabach 2013 and 2015 compared hydrus 2d simulations with experimental data under drip irrigation and optimized irrigation threshold to improve water use efficiency mmolawa and or 2003 compared the hydrus 2d model and analytical solution of soil water dynamics model in absence and presence of plants in the hydrus 2d model two assumptions cannot be neglected 1 soil evaporation was similar everywhere on soil surface and 2 root water uptake was calculated by introducing a non uniform distribution of potential rise rates over an arbitrarily shaped root zone vogel 1987 however for tomatoes grown in greenhouses methods for calculating plant transpiration i e root water uptake and soil evaporation are different from method by campbell and norman 1989 provided in the hydrus 2d another key point to consider is that the rld function at different growth stages may be discrepant which requires establishment of the 2d rld function and acquisition of regression parameters for each growth stages therefore the assumptions may lead to simulation errors as we considered under greenhouse with drip irrigation conditions in addition finite element method was used to divide computational grid in hydrus 2d while we believe that hybrid finite difference method may make the results more accurate when considering soil void structure and boundary division this is attributed to the fact that concept of series to discretize the continuous function is used in finite difference method while finite element method uses the interpolation principle to approximate the solution of the domain so it can only obtain the values at different points on the macro level furthermore the code of hydrus 2d was not available to the public which also limits researchers for improving the model based on this an improved soil hydrothermal dynamic model with code available to the public was developed for improving the accuracy of soil water and heat simulation in greenhouses under drip irrigation conditions the main objectives of this work were 1 to analyze the rld distribution of greenhouse grown tomato from multiple locations under drip irrigation 2 to develop a uzflow 2d model and compare with hydrus 2d in simulating soil water and heat dynamics 2 information of two numerical models 2 1 uzflow 2d model fortran package is used in uzflow 2d model to calculate the movement of unsaturated soil water flow hybrid finite difference implicit schemes of soil water potential content are employed to establish numerical equation of soil water flow to ensure convergence and stability of solution in equations iteration method is adopted to solve linear equations uzflow 2d model includes several basic modules e g unit water flow upper and lower boundary evapotranspiration irrigation observation value equation group solving and irrigation forecasting module this model can simulate soil water flux under different boundary conditions such as soil water potential water content soil evaporation crop transpiration root water uptake and potential evaporation hence uzflow 2d model can be used to simulate soil water and heat dynamics and a detailed flow chart was made for the operation of uzflow

we determined the parameters of 2d rld distribution function for the four different growth stages respectively potential water uptake rate of crop roots at different levels of soil profile can be calculated based on root distribution function and potential evapotranspiration the 2d root water uptake model is calculated by the feddes model feddes et al 1974 which includes rld distribution and

to solve equation parameters the finite difference formula of soil water flow movement is constructed according to the continuity equation of soil water flow movement according to the continuity equation difference between inflow and outflow soil unit water content is equal to the change in unit s water content when soil water density is a constant thus continuity equation can be expressed as follows allen and murphy 1985 18 q i 1 2 j q i 1 2 j q i j 1 2 q i j 1 2 w i j δ θ i j δ t δ z i δ x j where qi 1 2 j qi 1 2 j qi j 1 2 qi j 1 2 are units flowing into or out of soil within δt i j

due to nonlinear relationship among soil water movement parameters soil matrix potential and volumetric water content convergence of difference scheme and stability of solution must be considered to solve the above equations in this study the implicit iterative format h and the θ mixed finite difference equation are used to replace the eq 23 as 24 k i 1 2 j p 1 k δ x j δ t δ z i 1 2 h i 1 j p 1 k

itself the eq 25 can be expressed as a linear equation 2 2 hydrus 2d model hydrus 2d is a computer program that simulates 2d soil water and heat dynamics šimůnek et al 2006 which is based on solving the richards equation numerically using finite element scheme with the same equations as 1 and 2 2 2 1 hydraulic parameters and thermal properties the computer program retention curve program for unsaturated soils van genuchten et al 1998 estimations from the rosetta neural network model and observed soil physical properties were used to determine soil hydraulic parameters in greenhouse soil

experimental station in xinxiang city henan province of china 35 86 n 113 68 e altitude 78 7 m the site is located in the warm temperate continental monsoon climate zone with average annual air

soil physical and chemical properties are presented in table 2 a leading local variety of tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill cv jindingxinxing was selected as the study item two rows of seedling were transplanted to the wide row 65 cm between rows and 30 cm within rows on march 8 2015 and march 9 2016 respectively the planting density was 5 7 plants m 2 irrigation water was applied using surface drip irrigation with discharge rate of 1 1 l h 1 irrigation frequency was determined based on the measurements of water evaporation using a 20 cm pan placed 30 cm above crop canopy in the center of greenhouse gong et al 2020 to ensure survival of seedlings 20 mm water was irrigated by a drip irrigation system after transplanting liu et al 2019 gong et al 2019 thereafter irrigation events were occurred when cumulative evaporation reaches to 20 2 mm agronomic managements were operated by local farmers detailed growth stage irrigation information of greenhouse tomato in 2015 and 2016 are presented in table 3 2 4 2 measurements measurements of soil water content swc and soil temperature st within and between two neighboring rows were performed simultaneously swc was monitored by ech2o sensors 5te decagon devices inc usa which consist five probes installed in the 10 20 30 40 and 60 cm soil layer respectively data were recorded on one hour interval using em50 data logger decagon devices inc usa the measurements were calibrated by oven drying method 105 c 8 h st was measured using an automatic measuring instrument jl 04 which consists four probes installed in the 0 5 10 20 cm soil layers respectively data were also recorded on one hour interval using a data logger tingmdata center v6 0 china three replications were implemented for swc and st within and between two rows respectively the vertical and horizontal distributions of plant roots were measured at the seedling flowering fruit setting and picking stages respectively soil samples with roots were collected using a soil auger with diameter of 7 5 cm at depth of 0 80 cm with an interval of 10 cm in two study years the coordinates of the four points on x axis are defined as p1 0 0 p2 7 5 0 p3 15 0 and p4 22 5 0 while the other two points on y axis are defined as p5 0 7 5 and p6 0 15 schematic diagram of soil core sampling are presented in fig 1 soil core samples were rinsed with flowing fresh water and roots were left behind plant root morphology was analyzed by root system scanner perfection 4870photo epson japan and root length was calculated by winrhizo software regent instruments inc canada jha et al 2017 potential transpiration and potential evaporation were calculated by using dual crop coefficient method allen et al 2005 detailed measurement method calculation process and daily values of potential transpiration and potential evaporation can be found elsewhere gong et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 distribution of root length density fig 2 shows the vertical distributions of tomato rld at four growth stages in 2015 and 2016 more than 75 of total rld was concentrated in the soil layer within 20 cm at the seedling 40 cm at the flowering and 60 cm at both the fruit setting and picking stages these values slightly differ from results of zotarelli et al 2009 who reported that 51 78 of tomato rld under drip irrigation was concentrated in the soil layer within 15 cm during the reproductive phase while under furrow irrigation more than 81 of total rld was concentrated in the soil layer within 50 cm during the picking stage qiu et al 2017 these differences may be related to tomato planting conditions and soil water content in the root zone in terms of horizontal distribution rld decreased as horizontal distance from the origin position of plant p1 increased average rld at p1 was 7 8 88 3 20 5 83 5 7 6 88 9 and 6 7 76 1 higher than other positions at the seedling flowering fruit setting and picking stages respectively the maximum rld at different stages always appeared in 20 cm soil layer where the maximum value 1 2 cm cm 3 occurred at the fruit setting stage fig 2c2 the rld below 60 cm soil layer was relatively small and generally did not exceed 0 4 cm cm 3 this phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that water was mainly concentrated in the upper layer above 40 cm under drip irrigation while plant root system were water oriented jha et al 2017 average vertical rld for each soil layer was obtained by calculating the average values of two directions i e within and between two rows relative vertical rlds at different growth stages can be well fitted as exponential functions of relative root depth table 4 with the r 2 above 0 76 33 l r z a 1 l max e b 1 z z max where l r z is vertical rld cm cm 3 a 1 and b 1 are fitting coefficients l max is maximum rld cm cm 3 0 82 0 94 1 00 and 0 90 cm cm 3 for the seedling flowering fruit setting and picking stages z is soil depth cm z max is the maximum root growth depth cm 40 60 80 and 100 cm for seedling flowering fruit setting and picking stages respectively the function was similar to other crops such as grape vines zhou et al 2007 trees vrugt et al 2001 and tomato under furrow irrigation qiu et al 2017 the rld on x and y axes was expressed by using radial distance of relative main root p1 and relative rld fig 1 relative rld on x and y directions can also be fitted as an exponential functions of relative root depth table 4 with the r 2 of 0 63 0 89 34 l r z a 2 l max e b 2 y y max 35 l r z a 3 l max e b 3 x x max where l r z is vertical rld cm cm 3 a 2 b 2 a 3 and b 3 are fitting coefficients l max is the maximum rld cm cm 3 0 48 0 58 0 64 and 0 58 cm cm 3 for seedling flowering fruit setting and picking stages x and y is distance relative to p1 x max and y max is the middle of between and within two neighboring rows 18 and 12 cm respectively tomato rld distribution in direction of plant spacing and row spacing were similar thus 2d rld distribution changing along the vertical and horizontal radial directions can be obtained by averaging the measured data at different depths and different distances from circumference of plant besides tomato root density decayed exponentially in both vertical and radial directions referring to eqs 33 35 therefore tomato 2d rld distribution function was obtained after fitting the measured rld by the following formula 36 ρ r z ρ 0 exp δ r r m v z z m where r and z are horizontal and vertical distances from the p1 respectively cm r m and z m are the maximum horizontal length and vertical depth with values of 18 and 100 cm respectively ρ o δ ν are regression coefficients and the values at the four growth stages are shown in table 5 which was calibrated based on the data of 2015 the reliability of the 2d rld distribution function was then verified with the data of 2016 as shown in fig a3 some studies have also produced similar functions such as furrow irrigated tomato grown in greenhouse qiu et al 2017 and drip irrigated grape vines in field condition zhou et al 2007 3 2 evaluation of uzflow 2d and compared with hydrus 2d 3 2 1 performance in simulating soil water content fig 3 shows the comparison of swcs between simulated by two models uzflow 2d and hydrus 2d and measured by ech2o sensors in the soil depth of 10 20 30 40 and 60 cm the simulated values of both models are basically consistent with the measurements and uzflow 2d produced better accuracy than hydrus 2d especially at deep soil layer performance of uzflow 2d within rows was better than between rows the mean values of b 0 r 2 rmse rsr and ef within two rows in all locations were 1 00 0 90 0 006 cm3 cm 3 0 62 and 0 86 respectively likewise they were 1 01 0 83 0 009 cm3 cm 3 0 45 and 0 79 respectively between rows table 6 however hydrus 2d did not show a similar pattern in simulation swcs within and between rows at different soil layers discrepancies were greater in the upper soil layers 10 20 and 30 cm than in the deeper layers 40 and 60 cm which can be attributed to the fact that upper swcs was subject to irrigation and evaporation qiu et al 2017 skaggs et al 2004 vrugt et al 2001 our result was similar to the finding by qiu et al 2017 who simulated soil water dynamics of furrow irrigated tomato in a greenhouse by hydrus 2d skaggs et al 2004 also indicated that rmse of the simulated and measured swcs were in range of 0 02 0 04 cm3 cm 3 using hydrus 2d which was slightly worse than the performance of uzflow 2d in addition tomato root system showed an exponential function with soil depth with high rld in the upper soil layer which also influence the distribution of swcs in the upper soil layer and would likewise lead to lower simulation accuracy in the upper soil layer than in the deep soil layer vrugt et al 2001 indicated that effect of rld should be mainly considered when simulating soil water dynamics therefore fully considering the root water uptake was the key to improve the performance of uzflow 2d in simulating swcs after irrigation swcs increased quickly especially in the 0 20 cm layers to further verify the accuracy of uzflow 2d after irrigation swcs at three points p1 p2 p3 were texted within three days after irrigation and compared with hydrus 2d fig 4 results showed that the observations were uniformly distributed in vicinity of the simulated line and simulation in deeper soil layer 40 and 60 cm were better than upper layer 10 20 and 30 cm swcs above 20 cm increased rapidly after irrigation with an inflection point near 20 cm which may be due to large water lost above this soil layer before irrigation comparing the three simulation points we found that simulated accuracy in the p1 was better than p2 and p3 especially on the first day after irrigation with b 0 r 2 rmse rsr and ef of 1 00 0 95 0 003 cm3 cm 3 0 230 and 0 95 performance of uzflow 2d at the three points was also better than hydrus 2d from the first day to the third day after irrigation table 6 the above results indicate that both models perform well in simulating swc dynamic under drip irrigation but uzflow 2d is superior to hydrus 2d either after irrigation or over the whole growth stages these differences may result from the following reason 1 tomato roots under drip irrigation mainly distributed at soil layer of 0 60 cm and 2d rld were different in the soil layer at four growth stages the 2d rld functions in uzflow 2d can be set by itself according to the root growth conditions at different growth stages due to the open source which improves the simulation accuracy 2 the calculation methods of potential evaporation and potential transpiration of drip irrigated tomato are constructed according to the special environment of the greenhouse and then embedded into uzflow 2d to further improve the performance 3 under drip irrigation the swcs below 60 cm soil layer are relatively stable under a given flow rate wang et al 2009 which attribute to the fact that soil structure of the soil above 60 cm below the ground surface is too tight to penetrate the roots hence the finite difference method was used in uzflow 2d which was also the key to improve simulation accuracy therefore uzflow 2d can be used an effective tool to simulate swcs dynamic for greenhouse tomato with drip irrigation however the interactive interface of uzflow 2d has not been developed and classic cases have not been tested which is kept for a future study 3 2 2 performance in simulating soil temperature fig 5 shows the simulation results of sts at 0 5 10 and 20 cm within and between rows by uzflow 2d and hydrus 2d models the simulation values were in good agreement with the measurements at each soil depths simulation precision was also better in the upper layer 0 and 5 cm than the lower layer 10 and 20 cm and within rows than between rows the performance of uzflow 2d and hydrus 2d are comparable in simulating sts for uzflow 2d b 0 ranged from 0 98 to 1 01 r 2 was above 0 97 rmse and rsr were below 0 523 c and 0 235 and ef was higher than 0 95 average relative deviation at 0 5 10 and 20 cm soil layers were 1 0 0 37 0 21 and 0 09 within rows and 0 47 2 89 0 33 and 1 65 between two rows we believe that calibrating the thermal conductivity was the key to improve the performance of uzflow 2d in simulating sts lu et al 2007 and su et al 2016 also reported that soil thermal conductivity needs to be calibrated with swcs therefore the prerequisite to improve the accuracy of st simulation is to accurately obtain the changes of swcs 4 conclusions in this study we proposed a soil water and heat transport model namely uzflow 2d model and compared with the well known hydrus 2d model both models were tested for drip irrigated tomato grown in a greenhouse root length density function is an important parameter in uzflow 2d model we established a 2d root length density distribution function for different growth stages after analyzing the lateral and radial latitudes distribution characteristics of root length density on drip irrigation tomatoes which can be well fitted by an exponential function with r 2 0 77 for different growth stages uzflow 2d provided reasonable accuracy in simulating soil water content between and within two rows as well as after irrigation in addition uzflow 2d provided a good performance in simulating soil temperature between and within two rows with r 2 0 97 and rmse 0 53 c compared to hydrus 2d uzflow 2d slightly improved the accuracy for simulating soil water content and soil temperature therefore the developed uzflow 2d model can be used as a useful tool to simulate soil water and heat dynamics especially in greenhouses under drip irrigation our results are crucial to further study the response of crop root water uptake to soil environment and to understand the process of soil water plant atmosphere declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
