10455,as the standard method to compute reference evapotranspiration et0 penman monteith pm method requires eight meteorological input variables which makes it difficult to apply in data scarce regions to overcome this problem a hybrid bi directional long short term memory bi lstm model was developed to forecast short term 1 7 day lead time daily et0 the model was trained validated and tested using three meteorological variables for the period of 2006 2018 at selected three meteorological stations located in the semi arid region of central ningxia china the performance of the hybrid bi lstm model to forecast short term daily et0 was evaluated against daily et0 calculated by the penman monteith method using the statistical metrics namely mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse pearson s correlation coefficient r and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the results showed that the hybrid bi lstm model with a combination of three meteorological inputs maximum temperature minimum temperature and sunshine duration provides the best forecast performance for short term daily et0 at the selected meteorological stations when averaged across stations the statistical performance at different forecast lead time were as follows 1 day lead time rmse 0 159 mm day 1 mae 0 039 mm day 1 r 0 992 nse 0 988 4 day lead time rmse 0 247 mm day 1 mae 0 075 mm day 1 r 0 972 nse 0 985 and 7 day lead time rmse 0 323 mm day 1 mae 0 089 mm day 1 r 0 943 nse 0 982 moreover the hybrid bi lstm model consistently improved the forecast performance of short term daily et0 compared to the adjusted hargreaves samani hs method and the general bi lstm model the hybrid bi lstm model developed in this study is currently integrated into the modern intelligent irrigation system of 30 ha of lycium barbarum plantation in central ningxia in china a region with limited meteorological data it is recommended however that the hybrid bi lstm should be evaluated across a wide range of climatic conditions in different regions of the world keywords artificial neural network hybrid bi lstm penman monteith pm method reference evapotranspiration et0 sunshine duration temperature 1 introduction reference evapotranspiration et0 is an essential meteorological variable to compute crop water requirements and soil water balances abdullah et al 2015 djaman and irmak 2013 therefore reasonable estimate and forecast of et0 have become crucially important in agricultural water management especially in irrigated agriculture for real time irrigation scheduling and water saving technologies hobbins et al 2016 shiri 2017 globally the penman monteith fao 56 method is used as the standard method to estimate the et0 allen et al 1998 moreover this method has been served as a criterion for comparing the forecasted values of other models pereira et al 2015 sentelhas et al 2010 shiri 2017 however calculation of et0 using penman monteith method is not feasible enough at field scale as it requires large amount of meteorological variables that are not easy and convenient to measure in individual farms almorox et al 2015 todorovic et al 2013 valiantzas 2015 meanwhile hargreaves samani hs method hargreaves and samani 1985 has been proposed as an alternative to penman monteith method to estimate et0 with limited set of variables xu and singh 2002 almorox et al 2018 zanetti et al 2019 however the hs method has been shown to underestimate et0 in many of the previous studies bautista et al 2009 mendicino and senatore 2013 ravazzani et al 2012 valipour 2015 to overcome the above constraints techniques of big data analytics machine learning and deep learning have been examined to estimate et0 at different time scales with limited meteorological variables ferreira and da cunha 2020 khoob 2008 luo et al 2015 saggi and jain 2019 tikhamarine et al 2019 traore et al 2016 some of these techniques are neuro fuzzy models gocic et al 2016 malik et al 2019 patil and deka 2016 gene expression programming shiri 2017 mattar 2018 random forest models shiri 2018 artificial neural network ferreira et al 2019 luo et al 2015 wu and fan 2019 support vector machine pour et al 2018 ashrafzadeh et al 2020 multi layer perceptron neural network malik et al 2017 and m5p regression tree granata 2019 among these techniques gene expression programming models have been proven their better performance in comparison to the empirical and semi empirical models shiri 2017 shiri et al 2019 furthermore model coupling approaches such as coupled wavelet random forest methodology has substantially improved the performance accuracy of et0 estimation compared to the single random forest models shiri 2018 although these techniques have been used to estimate daily or monthly et0 there is dearth of their application to forecast short term 1 7 days daily et0 which is critically important to determine crop water requirements and real time irrigation scheduling in the past most of the approaches applied to forecast short term daily et0 have been based on empirical and ensemble predictions and their performances highly depend on the models and forecast inputs used perera et al 2016 xiong et al 2016 hence forecast accuracy has shown sensitivity to locations forecast lead time and quality of the numerical weather forecast inputs pelosi et al 2016 on the other hand forecast skill depends on which meteorlogical variables are utilized to forecast daily et0 for example yang et al 2019 demonstrated substantial improvement in et0 forecast performance when wind speed is included into weather inputs rather using only the temperature moreover performance of different meteorological input combinations varied in different locations input combination of maximum air temperature wind speed and solar radiation was appropriate to estimate monthly et0 in the low altitude while a five input combination maximum and minimum air temperatures relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation was required in the high altitude malik et al 2019 however there is no clear understanding on minimum required meteorlogical inputs to forecast short term daily et0 in data scarce regions like northwest china to address these issues we have undertaken a deep learning approach to better forecast short term daily et0 with limited meteorological variables to this end a hybrid bi directional long short term memory bi lstm model was developed to forecast short term daily et0 and then we evaluated the effects of different available meteorological input combinations on forecast performance bi directional long short term memory bi lstm model is a recurrent neural network rnn model which has two independent rnns this structure allows the model to preserve information from both past and future therefore bi lstm has better performance than unidirectional neural network models in processing data with time series characteristics sun et al 2018 lipton et al 2015 currently bi lstm models have been applied in seizure detection traffic prediction manufacturing and also in climate and environmental forecast abdelhameed et al 2018 akbari asanjan et al 2018 hu and zhang 2018 huang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 2019 therefore this study was conducted with a hypothesis that a hybrid bi lstm model can be implemented to forecast short term 1 day to 7 day lead time daily et0 through capitalizing its advantages of processing time series data and improved forecast performance the specific objectives of this paper are as follows 1 to explore the forecast performance of the hybrid bi lstm model for short term daily maximum and minimum temperature 2 to evaluate the effects of different meteorological input combinations on short term daily et0 forecasts by the hybrid bi lstm model 3 to compare the hybrid bi lstm model and adjusted hs method with penman monteith model for the forecast performance of short term daily et0 and 4 to evaluate the effectiveness of the hybrid bi lstm model with a general bi lstm model to forecast short term daily et0 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the meteorological data used in this study were collected from three meteorological stations in the central ningxia of the northwest china fig 1 namely yanchi station yc latitude 37 28 n longitude 107 28 e and elevation 1474 m amsl tongxin station tx latitude 36 99 n longitude 105 92 e and elevation 1352 m amsl and zhongning station zn latitude 37 28 n longitude 105 69 e and elevation 1304 m amsl the mean annual precipitation is 126 225 mm and concentrated in the months of july august and september gale weather strong wind is prominent during the winter and spring months with an average duration of 20 46 days therefore the central ningxia can be classified as semi arid climatic region hai yan et al 2011 the daily meteorological data for the period of 13 years 2006 2018 were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma gov cn these daily meteorological variables include mean air temperature tmean maximum air temperature tmax minimum air temperature tmin mean relative humidity rh wind speed u2 solar radiation ra sunshine duration h precipitation and actual vapor pressure ea the 1 day 4 day and 7 day lead time forecast periods data of maximum air temperature tmax minimum air temperature tmin sunshine duration h and weather type wt were also retrieved from weather china http www weather com cn for the period of 2016 2018 at the same meteorological stations the weather type means either a day being sunny cloudy overcast rain mao et al 1995 liu et al 2017 the forecast data are used as inputs to the hybrid bi lstm model collected daily meteorological data 2006 2018 were divided into three sub datasets training dataset 2006 2011 validation dataset 2012 2015 and testing dataset 2016 2018 training data set was used to train the hybrid bi lstm model and to estimate the weights validation data set was used to validate the model with sufficient accuracy and the test data set was used to evaluate the performance of the model by calculating daily et0 using penman monteith method and hargreaves samani method furthermore training data set was used to perform the correlation analysis between daily et0 and individual meteorological variables tmax tmin h ra and u2 to determine the most important meteorological input combinations for the hybrid bi lstm model accordingly the highest significant correlations observed for tmax r2 0 7 tmin r2 0 5 and h r2 0 44 while correlations for ra and u2 were not significant hence tmax tmin and h were included into the input combinations to evaluate the short term daily et0 forecast additionally wt was included into one of the model combinations since it has been used to correct temperature based hargreaves samani method mao et al 1995 the input combinations used to evaluate the short term daily et0 forecast are given in table 1 2 2 penman monteith method the fao 56 penman monteith pm method allen et al 1998 is widely used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration in agricultural hydrological and ecological sciences the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao recognized this method as the standard method to compute reference evapotranspiration ladlani et al 2012 traore et al 2016 here the daily et0 values calculated by the pm method were used in the performance evaluation of the hybrid bi lstm model the pm equation eq 1 is expressed as follows 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is the daily reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure function kpa 1 rn is the net radiation mjm 2day 1 g is the soil heat flux density at the soil surface mj m 2day 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa 1 t is the mean air temperature u 2 is the mean wind speed at 2 m above soil surface ms 1 e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa and e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa 2 3 adjusted hargreaves samani method hargreaves samani hs method is considered as a temperature based method to estimate daily et0 hargreaves 1985 since hs method uses only temperature data and extraterrestrial radiation this method can be used to estimate daily et0 when other meteorological variables are missing the hs equation eq 2 is expressed as follows 2 e t 0 0 408 k h t m a x t m i n t m e a n k t r a where tmax tmin and tmean are the maximum minimum and mean air temperature respectively r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2day 1 while k h and k t are the coefficients the original values of these coefficients are k h 0 0023 and k t 17 8 however these coefficients require local calibration to improve the accuracy of the hs method at different locations mao et al 1995 proposed the weather type wt correction coefficient to calibrate the hs equation so it can be adjusted according to the local meteorological characteristics of different regions four weather types have been defined in their study namely sunny cloudy overcast and rain the correction coefficient of a weather type can be derived by comparing the daily et0 value calculated by the hs method with the multi year average of daily et0 for forecast period the equation for the adjusted hs method eq 3 is expressed as follows 3 e t 0 i γ i e t 0 i where e t 0 i is the ith daily et0 calculated by the hs method mm day 1 γ i is the ith weather type correction coefficient e t 0 i is the multi year average of daily et0 calculated by the hs method mm day 1 the adjusted hs method was used to compare and evaluate the performance of the hybrid bi lstm model in this study 2 4 development of hybrid bi directional long short term memory bi lstm model and its components 2 4 1 long short term memory lstm the core idea of the long short term memory lstm is to replace every hidden unit in recurrent neural network rnn with a cell of memory function hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 basically it is a variant of rnn model and can be adapted to achieve excellent performance in processing time series data graves 2013 graves et al 2013 sutskever et al 2014 in order to solve the problem of gradient disappearance gradient expansion and error hindrance in the traditional lstm an extended memory block with a memory cell is applied to the lstm gers et al 1999 the memory cell can keep the historical data in the memory and wake it up in any epoch when needed fig 2 illustrates the operating mechanism and internal memory cell of the lstm where ct 1 is the memory unit of the network at the previous time step t 1 ct is the state of memory at time t ht is the output of hidden state at time t ht 1 is a vector containing the values of the output by each memory in the hidden layer at the previous time step t 1 or at the initial hidden state xt is the input at time t forget gate input gate cell gate and output gate units are denoted by ft it c t and ot respectively the memory cell learns at the t time based on the input at the t time and the output at the t 1 time in the network the detail algorithm involved in the components of the memory cell is described as follows eqs 4 9 4 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 5 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 6 c t t a n h w c h t 1 x t b c 7 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 8 o t s o f t s i g n w o h t 1 x t b o 9 h t o t r e l u c t where wf wi wc and wo are weight matrices of the forget gate input gate cell gate and output gate units respectively bf bi bc and bo are the bias vectors of the forget gate input gate cell gate and output gate units respectively σ is the classical sigmoid activation function of the forget gate and input gate units the activation functions of the cell gate unit output gate unit and output are denoted by tanh softsign and relu respectively in comparison to the traditional method proposed by liption et al 2015 two activation functions in the lstm output gate stage were modified in this study first modification is to replace σ activation function with softsign activation function which can increase the speed of model training the other modification is the use of rectified linear unit relu activation function instead of the σ which can make the network to dynamically control the time scale and the forgetting behavior of different units 2 4 2 bi directional lstm bi lstm model bi lstm is composed of bi directional recurrent neural networks bi rnn and the long short term memory lstm which is a standard neural network byeon et al 2015 schuster and paliwal 1997 the concept of bi rnn is that each training sequence has forward and backward rnn and both of them are connected with an output layer fig 3 each point in the input sequence of the output layer is provided with the complete past and future contextual information there is no information flow between the forward and the backward implied layers which ensures that the expansion graph is non cycle however bi rnn has been exposed to the drawbacks of gradient explosion and information morphing when backpropagation is carried out therefore bi lstm is generated in this case to solve the problem of gradient explosion and information morphing abdelhameed et al 2018 besides it can efficiently process the sequential data composed of time instances graves and schmidhuber 2005 hu and zhang 2018 the structure of the bi lstm model is shown in fig 3 where w i i 1 2 6 are the six independent weight matrices as follows input to forward and backward hidden layer weights w 1 w 3 hidden layer to hidden layer weights w 2 w 5 forward and backward hidden layer to output layer weights w 4 w 6 these six weights are used repeatedly at each time step the hidden layer of the bi lstm model needs to save two values of h t in which h t involves in the forward calculation and h t involves in the backward calculation the final output value ot obtained by combining the outputs of the forward layer and the backward layer which can be expressed mathematically eqs 10 12 as follows 10 h t f w 1 x t w 2 h t 1 11 h t f w 3 x t w 5 h t 1 12 o t g w 4 h t w 6 h t 2 4 3 hybrid bi lstm model in order to improve the goodness of fit between the forecasted daily et0 from the bi lstm model and the pm method daily et0 the forecast value of the bi lstm model was processed by an artificial neural network ann shortly referred to as hybrid bi lstm model in this study in general an ann is composed of an input layer hidden layers and an output layer based on a network of artificial neurons connected by weights the ann used in this study has only one hidden layer which is also a classical neural network structure ferreira et al 2019 as demonstrated by maier et al 2010 the structure of the ann needs to be formulated according to the specific tasks therefore the input of the ann was determined by the output of the bi lstm model for this study in order to improve the accuracy of forecast the output of the bi lstm model was divided into 12 monthly sequences prior to ingest as input into the ann hence the ann has 12 input neurons and the number of neurons in the hidden layer are obtained by a trial and error procedure finally the ann network of 12 36 12 was found to be the most appropriate structure in which 12 neuron inputs are divided by 12 monthly vector groups according to the values forecasted by the bi lstm model with the length of 31 for each neuron and the default missing value is 1 fig 4 shows the architecture of the ann model and the final calculation formula of the output is expressed in eq 13 13 y i j 1 36 w j i 2 σ i 1 12 w i j 1 r i b 1 b 2 where r i and y i are the input and output vectors respectively σ is the activation function b 1 and b 2 are the bias units of the first and second layers respectively w i j 1 is the weight vector of the first layer from the neuron i to the neuron j w j i 2 is the weight vector of the second layer from the neuron j to the neuron i the weights of the ann model were initialized to a random number of gaussian distribution with the mean value of 0 and the variance of 0 01 and the bias was initialized to 1 the stochastic gradient descent via the back propagation algorithm was used to update the weights and bias between each layer of the model to avoid extremely small weighting factors and convergence problems during the training of the ann all the input and output variables were standardized according to the eq 14 14 x n i x μ σ where x n i is the normalized dimensionless variable x is the observed value μ is the mean of the sample data σ is the standard deviation of the sample data all these models were implemented in the python programming language with the tensorflow 1 2 an open source platform for machine learning and ubuntu 16 04 operating system fig 5 demonstrates the working procedure of the hybrid bi lstm model to forecast daily et0 the bi lstm model was obtained by initializing the two lstm cells by calling the tf nn bidirectional dynamic rnn function in the tensorflow when initializing the lstm cell the activation function selects the relu activation and provides the value of lstm dim parameter the lstm dim parameter represents the number of hidden layer cells and the number of notes that can remember and store generally the value of the lstm dim parameter is 100 or 150 two bi lstm models with hidden layer of 100 and 150 were trained and the experimental results showed that lstm dim 150 is the best option for this study to prevent overfitting and gradient vanishing from joining dropouts during the training and validation phases of the hybrid bi lstm model an optimization algorithm called adam was applied to update the network weight and bias considering the root mean square error rmse as the overall fitness function in the program the model training was terminated when the value of rmse function is no longer updated when the model was initialized the weight and bias values jozefowicz et al 2015 were set to 0 5 and 1 0 respectively the final hyperparameters of the hybrid bi lstm model with the three input combinations used in this study are listed in table 2 the learning rate is the learning efficiency of the network batch size is the number of samples per batch weight decay represents the l2 regularization coefficient dropout is the quantity ratio of randomly selected training samples to the total samples epochs is the number of iterations to obtain the optimal model 2 5 model performance evaluation to evaluate the performance of the models the following five statistical indicators were used gocic et al 2016 1 accuracy 15 a c c u r a c y a n 100 accuracy eq 15 was used to assess the accuracy of the temperature forecasts where a is the number of days that forecast the temperatures correctly while n is the total number of days root mean square error eq 16 mean absolute error eq 17 pearson correlation coefficient eq 18 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency eq 19 were calculated as follows 2 root mean square error rmse 16 r m s e i 1 n x i y i 2 n 3 mean absolute error mae 17 m a e i 1 n x i y i n 4 pearson correlation coefficient r 18 r i 1 n x i x i y i y i i 1 n x i x i 2 i 1 n y i x i 2 1 r 1 5 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 19 n s e 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 n s e 1 where x i and y i denote the forecasted and the observed daily et0 values at the ith time step respectively n is the sample size x i and y i represent the corresponding mean et0 values for the comparison of the temperature forecast x i and y i are the temperature forecast of the hybrid bi lstm model and temperature forecast downloaded from weather china respectively for the comparison of the daily et0 x i and y i are the et0 values forecasted by the hybrid bi lstm model and the et0 values computed by the pm method respectively pearson correlation coefficient r value closer to 1 0 indicates the greater goodness of fit between forecasted and the observed values nse value of 1 0 signifies a perfect match of forecasted values to the observed values nse values of zero indicates that the forecast values are as accurate as the mean of the observed values while nse less than zero highlight the poor performance of the forecast model moriasi et al 2007 nash and sutcliffe 1970 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance analysis of maximum temperature and minimum temperature forecasts by the hybrid bi lstm model the maximum temperature and the minimum temperature are highly correlated with et0 and two important meteorological inputs of the model therefore the accuracy of temperature forecast is the key factor to determine the accuracy of et0 forecast in the following steps antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 the model performance indicators namely accuracy mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and pearson correlation coefficient r of the forecast of the daily maximum tmax and the daily minimum temperature tmin in 1 7 days lead time are shown in fig 6 accordingly the range of the pearson correlation coefficient 0 8 0 94 signifies higher linear correlation between the forecast value and the observed value of both the tmax and the tmin over the 1 7 days forecast lead time at the three meteorological stations however the overall trend of the four statistical indicators fig 6 the forecast performance of both the tmax and the tmin are decreasing with increasing forecast lead time remarkably the rate of declining of forecast performances for both the tmax and the tmin were substantially greater in 4 day lead time than any other days this finding is common phenomenon in numerical weather forecasting regardless of forecasting tools and methodologies li et al 2018 mariotti et al 2018 xiong et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 moreover all the performance indicators for the forecast of the tmin are better than that of the tmax in all three meteorological stations for example the accuracy of the tmin was higher than the tmax by 3 2 13 3 over the 1 7 days forecast lead time the mae and rmse of the tmin were lower than the tmax by 0 9 17 9 and 5 3 23 1 respectively furthermore the best forecast performance for the tmax and the tmin were observed at yc and zn meteorological stations respectively the mae values of the forecast of both the tmax and the tmin were less than 2 over the 1 7 days forecast lead time at the three meteorological stations fig 6b 6f which satisfies the acceptable standard of the prediction bias of the temperature forecast thornes 1996 cma 2005 hence the performance of hybrid bi lstm model to forecast tmax and tmin are acceptable and can better support the forecast of et0 3 2 performance analysis of et0 forecasts with different input combinations by the hybrid bi lstm model here the three different input combinations table 1 namely x 1 t t m a x t t m i n t x 2 t t m a x t t m i n t h t w t t and x 3 t t m a x t t m i n t h t were separately ingested to the hybrid bi lstm to forecast the daily et0 over the 1 7 day lead time during the training validation and testing periods and the best input combination was selected in all the instances the short term daily et0 forecasted by the hybrid bi lstm model was compared against the daily et0 calculated by the pm method which was considered as the standard method to assess the performance of the hybrid bi lstm model table 3 presents the performance of the hybrid bi lstm model to forecast the short term daily et0 during the model training validation and testing accordingly the third input combination x 3 t that consists of tmax tmin and h showed the highest performance among the three input combinations based on the fact that this combination showed lowest mae and rmse and highest r values table 3 moreover the results indicated that the performance of the hybrid bi lstm model is greater during the model testing than that in the model training and validation which highlights the robustness of the model these results further revealed the fact that increasing the number of meteorological variables may not always improve the accuracy of the daily et0 forecast in deep learning models this was consistent with the findings of antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 ferreira and da cunha 2020 and patil and deka 2016 in all these previous studies less than four meteorological variables have been used to estimate et0 with the sufficient accuracy in contrast shiri 2018 and tikhamarine et al 2019 proposed more than four meteorological variables to estimate et0 with acceptable level of accuracy using machine learning methods these meteorological variables included maximum temperature minimum temperature dewpoint temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation these findings further prove that the air temperature is an indispensable variable to forecast the et0 using deep learning and machine learning techniques the unique outcome of this study is the applicability of the sunshine duration with the maximum and minimum temperatures to better forecast the daily et0 instead of the use of solar radiation which may not be available in the meteorological stations with the limited infrastructure moreover site specificity also plays a role in the selection of different meteorological variables as inputs to estimate the et0 for example input combination of maximum air temperature wind speed and solar radiation was appropriate to estimate monthly et0 in the low altitude while a five input combination maximum and minimum air temperatures relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation was required in the high altitude malik et al 2019 however this study showed the highest performance for the input combination of maximum temperature minimum temperature and sunshine duration across the three meteorological stations figs 7 9 show the performance of the hybrid bi lstm model to forecast the daily et0 during the model testing in different forecast lead time the daily et0 forecasts are plotted against the daily et0 calculated by the pm method under different combinations of meteorological inputs in the lead time of 1 day fig 7 4 day fig 8 and 7 day fig 9 it can be noticed that the overall trend of the daily et0 forecast by the hybrid bi lstm model was consistent with the daily et0 values calculated by the pm method which reflects the ability of the hybrid bi lstm model to represent the temporal variability of the daily et0 over the course of the year when the forecasted daily et0 values averaged across the forecast lead times the hybrid bi lstm model overestimated the daily et0 by 21 6 under the input combination of x 1 t while underestimated the daily et0 by 16 4 under the input combination of x 2 t the third input combination x 3 t underestimated the daily et0 by 8 4 but had the lowest bias among the input combinations evaluated in this study the trend of these biases becomes more and more obvious with the increase of forecast lead time as a result of decreasing forecast performance with increasing lead time li et al 2018 mariotti et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 additionaly incoporation of weather type wt did not improve the forecast accuracy this could be because the meteorological factor wt only considers four weather types sunny cloudy overcast and rain while the actual weather types are diverse and dynamic in nature which may lead to improper correction results during the complex weather types thus affects the forecast performance therefore the hybrid bi lstm model with the third input combination x 3 t was selected as the final model to forecast short term daily et0 it signifies the strong influence of both the maximum and minimum temperatures in et0 forecasting while the sunshine duration also has a non ignorable contribution to better forecast the daily et0 using deep learning methods in the following section the hybrid bi lstm model with the third input combination was used to forecast short term daily et0 for the period of 2016 2018 at the three meteorological stations and the forecast performance was compared with the short term daily et0 forecast of the adjusted hs method this is because the hs method has been identified as one of the potential methods to estimate the daily et0 when meteorological variables are limited allen et al 1998 droogers and allen 2002 hargreaves and allen 2003 xu and singh 2002 3 3 comparison of the forecasted short term daily et0 by the hybrid bi lstm model with the adjusted hs method the performance indicators of the hybrid bi lstm model and the adjusted hs method to forecast short term daily et0 in three meteorological stations compared to the daily et0 calculated by the pm method is shown in table 4 results showed higher performance for the hybrid bi lstm model than the adjusted hs method in all the meteorological stations this can be noted from both the lower mae and rmse and higher r and nse showed by the hybrid bi lstm model compared to the adjusted hs method table 4 irrespective of forecast methods increasing mae and rmse and decreasing r and nse with increasing forecast lead time once again prove the declining forecast skill with increasing lead time mariotti et al 2018 xiong et al 2016 moreover it can be noted that the nse values of the hybrid bi lstm model at the three meteorological stations yc tx and zn were consistent and the difference of the mae rmse and r across the stations were less than 8 5 nonetheless the adjusted hs method had lower nse and r values with the larger variations for mae and rmse across different meteorological stations this result showed that the hybrid bi lstm model is superior to the adjusted hs method in terms of accuracy and stability of the daily et0 forecast the relationship between short term daily et0 forecast by the hybrid bi lstm model and the adjusted hs method in comparison to the calculated daily et0 by the pm method were illustrated in figs 10 12 overall the hybrid bi lstm model showed greater performance than the adjusted hs method to forecast of short term daily et0 in all three meteorological stations this result is in agreement with shiri 2017 and yang et al 2019 where the authors argued that the performance of the deep learning methods to estimate the et0 are better than that of the hs method especially in the arid and sub arid regions furthermore the average forecast performance of the daily et0 at yanchi station was highest and followed by tongxin station and zhongning station table 4 figs 10 12 this is consistent with the performance of the temperature forecast by the hybrid bi lstm model section 3 1 when the statistical indicators are averaged across the three meteorological stations and forecast lead time the summarized performance indicators of the hybrid bi lstm model and the adjusted hs method were rmse 0 241 0 312 mm day 1 mae 0 068 0 114 mm day 1 r 0 969 0 954 and nse 0 985 0 983 respectively 3 4 evaluation of the effectiveness of the hybrid bi lstm model with a general bi lstm model in order to evaluate the effectiveness of integrating bi lstm model and ann called as hybrid bi lstm model in this study over the general bi lstm model the general bi lstm model was trained validated and tested using the same datasets table 5 shows the statistical indicators for the forecast of the daily et0 by the general bi lstm model in comparison to the daily et0 calculated by the pm method during model testing at the three meteorological stations the input combinations were kept the same which includes maximum air temperature minimum air temperature and sunshine duration the performance indicators have clearly shown the effectiveness of the hybrid bi lstm model model integration over the general bi lstm model in any lead time of the forecast horizon within 7 days tables 4 5 this can be observed from the substantially lower mae and rmse and substantially higher nse and r values obtained for the hybrid bi lstm model than the general bi lstm model tables 4 5 therefore the integration or hybridization of models is far better than using a single model to forecast meteorological variables this finding is in support of the works reported by agarap 2018 azimi et al 2016 meshram et al 2019 and zhang et al 2019 compared with the hybrid machine learning method proposed by tikhamarine et al 2019 to estimate monthly et0 this study proposes not only the integration of the general bi lstm with an artificial neural network ann but also the organic construction of the two different models to forecast short term daily et0 to optimize the irrigation for precision agriculture it is necessary to calculate the crop water demand with high accuracy reference evapotranspiration et0 serves as an important input to estimate crop water demand and plan for irrigation scheduling hunsaker et al 2003 currently biases in et0 estimation resulted by incomplete or missing meteorological data significantly affects the accuracy of the estimation of crop water demands however these constraints can be solved by developing tools with model integration and artificial intelligence as highlighted in this study these tools have greater potential to be adapted in agricultural water management ballesteros et al 2016 mattar 2018 saggi and jain 2019 sherafatpour et al 2019 especially with the curent development of internet of things iot in agriculture the hybrid bi lstm model developed in this study is currently integrated into the modern intelligent irrigation system of 30 ha of lycium barbarum plantation in central ningxia china as a solution for the lack of meteorological data 4 conclusions reference evapotranspiration et0 is an essential meteorological variable to compute crop water requirements to optimize irrigation in precision agriculture although the penman monteith method is used as the standard to estimate the et0 allen et al 1998 this method is not applicable in data scarce regions as it requires large number of meteorological variables to overcome this problem the hybrid bi lstm model was developed to forecast short term 1 7 day lead time daily et0 the hybrid bi lstm model was trained validated and tested using the meteorological variables for the period of 2006 2018 at the three meteorological stations located in the semi arid region of central ningxia china the performance of the hybrid bi lstm model to forecast short term daily et0 was evaluated against the daily et0 calculated by the penman monteith method using the statistical indicators namely mae rmse pearson correlation coefficient r and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse additionally the hybrid bi lstm model was compared with the adjusted hs method and general bi lstm model the following conclusions can be derived from this study 1 the performance of the hybrid bi lstm model with a combination of three meteorological inputs maximum temperature minimum temperature and sunshine duration was superior to the corresponding other input combinations and the adjusted hs method to forecast short term daily et0 2 sunshine duration data showed higher correlation with the et0 than that of the solar radiation in the studied locations hence adding sunshine duration as the input to the hybrid bi lstm model in addition to the maximum and minimum temperatures has improved the accuracy of the daily et0 forecast when radiation data is missing or inaccurate sunshine duration data could be used to forecast daily et0 in the arid and semi arid regions however the use of weather type as input to the hybrid bi lstm model reduces the forecast accuracy of short term daily et0 3 the hybrid bi lstm model substantially improved the performance of short term daily et0 forecast over the general bi lstm model as a result of the integration of general bi lstm model with an artificial neural network ann which enabled to account for both physical and big data characteristics of meteorological data to forecast daily et0 4 the forecast accuracy of short term daily et0 declines with increasing forecast lead time regardless of forecast models and locations since the hybrid bi lstm model was developed in the semi arid region of northwest china this model may not be directly applied to the other climatic regions in the world however the proposed methodology and data management is expected to be transferable to other regions especially with limited meteorological observations future works should focus the evaluation of the performance of the hybrid bi lstm model in comparison to other deep learning approaches across a wide range of climatic conditions to confirm the broad applicability of the model to forecast short

10455,as the standard method to compute reference evapotranspiration et0 penman monteith pm method requires eight meteorological input variables which makes it difficult to apply in data scarce regions to overcome this problem a hybrid bi directional long short term memory bi lstm model was developed to forecast short term 1 7 day lead time daily et0 the model was trained validated and tested using three meteorological variables for the period of 2006 2018 at selected three meteorological stations located in the semi arid region of central ningxia china the performance of the hybrid bi lstm model to forecast short term daily et0 was evaluated against daily et0 calculated by the penman monteith method using the statistical metrics namely mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse pearson s correlation coefficient r and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the results showed that the hybrid bi lstm model with a combination of three meteorological inputs maximum temperature minimum temperature and sunshine duration provides the best forecast performance for short term daily et0 at the selected meteorological stations when averaged across stations the statistical performance at different forecast lead time were as follows 1 day lead time rmse 0 159 mm day 1 mae 0 039 mm day 1 r 0 992 nse 0 988 4 day lead time rmse 0 247 mm day 1 mae 0 075 mm day 1 r 0 972 nse 0 985 and 7 day lead time rmse 0 323 mm day 1 mae 0 089 mm day 1 r 0 943 nse 0 982 moreover the hybrid bi lstm model consistently improved the forecast performance of short term daily et0 compared to the adjusted hargreaves samani hs method and the general bi lstm model the hybrid bi lstm model developed in this study is currently integrated into the modern intelligent irrigation system of 30 ha of lycium barbarum plantation in central ningxia in china a region with limited meteorological data it is recommended however that the hybrid bi lstm should be evaluated across a wide range of climatic conditions in different regions of the world keywords artificial neural network hybrid bi lstm penman monteith pm method reference evapotranspiration et0 sunshine duration temperature 1 introduction reference evapotranspiration et0 is an essential meteorological variable to compute crop water requirements and soil water balances abdullah et al 2015 djaman and irmak 2013 therefore reasonable estimate and forecast of et0 have become crucially important in agricultural water management especially in irrigated agriculture for real time irrigation scheduling and water saving technologies hobbins et al 2016 shiri 2017 globally the penman monteith fao 56 method is used as the standard method to estimate the et0 allen et al 1998 moreover this method has been served as a criterion for comparing the forecasted values of other models pereira et al 2015 sentelhas et al 2010 shiri 2017 however calculation of et0 using penman monteith method is not feasible enough at field scale as it requires large amount of meteorological variables that are not easy and convenient to measure in individual farms almorox et al 2015 todorovic et al 2013 valiantzas 2015 meanwhile hargreaves samani hs method hargreaves and samani 1985 has been proposed as an alternative to penman monteith method to estimate et0 with limited set of variables xu and singh 2002 almorox et al 2018 zanetti et al 2019 however the hs method has been shown to underestimate et0 in many of the previous studies bautista et al 2009 mendicino and senatore 2013 ravazzani et al 2012 valipour 2015 to overcome the above constraints techniques of big data analytics machine learning and deep learning have been examined to estimate et0 at different time scales with limited meteorological variables ferreira and da cunha 2020 khoob 2008 luo et al 2015 saggi and jain 2019 tikhamarine et al 2019 traore et al 2016 some of these techniques are neuro fuzzy models gocic et al 2016 malik et al 2019 patil and deka 2016 gene expression programming shiri 2017 mattar 2018 random forest models shiri 2018 artificial neural network ferreira et al 2019 luo et al 2015 wu and fan 2019 support vector machine pour et al 2018 ashrafzadeh et al 2020 multi layer perceptron neural network malik et al 2017 and m5p regression tree granata 2019 among these techniques gene expression programming models have been proven their better performance in comparison to the empirical and semi empirical models shiri 2017 shiri et al 2019 furthermore model coupling approaches such as coupled wavelet random forest methodology has substantially improved the performance accuracy of et0 estimation compared to the single random forest models shiri 2018 although these techniques have been used to estimate daily or monthly et0 there is dearth of their application to forecast short term 1 7 days daily et0 which is critically important to determine crop water requirements and real time irrigation scheduling in the past most of the approaches applied to forecast short term daily et0 have been based on empirical and ensemble predictions and their performances highly depend on the models and forecast inputs used perera et al 2016 xiong et al 2016 hence forecast accuracy has shown sensitivity to locations forecast lead time and quality of the numerical weather forecast inputs pelosi et al 2016 on the other hand forecast skill depends on which meteorlogical variables are utilized to forecast daily et0 for example yang et al 2019 demonstrated substantial improvement in et0 forecast performance when wind speed is included into weather inputs rather using only the temperature moreover performance of different meteorological input combinations varied in different locations input combination of maximum air temperature wind speed and solar radiation was appropriate to estimate monthly et0 in the low altitude while a five input combination maximum and minimum air temperatures relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation was required in the high altitude malik et al 2019 however there is no clear understanding on minimum required meteorlogical inputs to forecast short term daily et0 in data scarce regions like northwest china to address these issues we have undertaken a deep learning approach to better forecast short term daily et0 with limited meteorological variables to this end a hybrid bi directional long short term memory bi lstm model was developed to forecast short term daily et0 and then we evaluated the effects of different available meteorological input combinations on forecast performance bi directional long short term memory bi lstm model is a recurrent neural network rnn model which has two independent rnns this structure allows the model to preserve information from both past and future therefore bi lstm has better performance than unidirectional neural network models in processing data with time series characteristics sun et al 2018 lipton et al 2015 currently bi lstm models have been applied in seizure detection traffic prediction manufacturing and also in climate and environmental forecast abdelhameed et al 2018 akbari asanjan et al 2018 hu and zhang 2018 huang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 2019 therefore this study was conducted with a hypothesis that a hybrid bi lstm model can be implemented to forecast short term 1 day to 7 day lead time daily et0 through capitalizing its advantages of processing time series data and improved forecast performance the specific objectives of this paper are as follows 1 to explore the forecast performance of the hybrid bi lstm model for short term daily maximum and minimum temperature 2 to evaluate the effects of different meteorological input combinations on short term daily et0 forecasts by the hybrid bi lstm model 3 to compare the hybrid bi lstm model and adjusted hs method with penman monteith model for the forecast performance of short term daily et0 and 4 to evaluate the effectiveness of the hybrid bi lstm model with a general bi lstm model to forecast short term daily et0 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the meteorological data used in this study were collected from three meteorological stations in the central ningxia of the northwest china fig 1 namely yanchi station yc latitude 37 28 n longitude 107 28 e and elevation 1474 m amsl tongxin station tx latitude 36 99 n longitude 105 92 e and elevation 1352 m amsl and zhongning station zn latitude 37 28 n longitude 105 69 e and elevation 1304 m amsl the mean annual precipitation is 126 225 mm and concentrated in the months of july august and september gale weather strong wind is prominent during the winter and spring months with an average duration of 20 46 days therefore the central ningxia can be classified as semi arid climatic region hai yan et al 2011 the daily meteorological data for the period of 13 years 2006 2018 were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma gov cn these daily meteorological variables include mean air temperature tmean maximum air temperature tmax minimum air temperature tmin mean relative humidity rh wind speed u2 solar radiation ra sunshine duration h precipitation and actual vapor pressure ea the 1 day 4 day and 7 day lead time forecast periods data of maximum air temperature tmax minimum air temperature tmin sunshine duration h and weather type wt were also retrieved from weather china http www weather com cn for the period of 2016 2018 at the same meteorological stations the weather type means either a day being sunny cloudy overcast rain mao et al 1995 liu et al 2017 the forecast data are used as inputs to the hybrid bi lstm model collected daily meteorological data 2006 2018 were divided into three sub datasets training dataset 2006 2011 validation dataset 2012 2015 and testing dataset 2016 2018 training data set was used to train the hybrid bi lstm model and to estimate the weights validation data set was used to validate the model with sufficient accuracy and the test data set was used to evaluate the performance of the model by calculating daily et0 using penman monteith method and hargreaves samani method furthermore training data set was used to perform the correlation analysis between daily et0 and individual meteorological variables tmax tmin h ra and u2 to determine the most important meteorological input combinations for the hybrid bi lstm model accordingly the highest significant correlations observed for tmax r2 0 7 tmin r2 0 5 and h r2 0 44 while correlations for ra and u2 were not significant hence tmax tmin and h were included into the input combinations to evaluate the short term daily et0 forecast additionally wt was included into one of the model combinations since it has been used to correct temperature based hargreaves samani method mao et al 1995 the input combinations used to evaluate the short term daily et0 forecast are given in table 1 2 2 penman monteith method the fao 56 penman monteith pm method allen et al 1998 is widely used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration in agricultural hydrological and ecological sciences the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao recognized this method as the standard method to compute reference evapotranspiration ladlani et al 2012 traore et al 2016 here the daily et0 values calculated by the pm method were used in the performance evaluation of the hybrid bi lstm model the pm equation eq 1 is expressed as follows 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is the daily reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure function kpa 1 rn is the net radiation mjm 2day 1 g is the soil heat flux density at the soil surface mj m 2day 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa 1 t is the mean air temperature u 2 is the mean wind speed at 2 m above soil surface ms 1 e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa and e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa 2 3 adjusted hargreaves samani method hargreaves samani hs method is considered as a temperature based method to estimate daily et0 hargreaves 1985 since hs method uses only temperature data and extraterrestrial radiation this method can be used to estimate daily et0 when other meteorological variables are missing the hs equation eq 2 is expressed as follows 2 e t 0 0 408 k h t m a x t m i n t m e a n k t r a where tmax tmin and tmean are the maximum minimum and mean air temperature respectively r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2day 1 while k h and k t are the coefficients the original values of these coefficients are k h 0 0023 and k t 17 8 however these coefficients require local calibration to improve the accuracy of the hs method at different locations mao et al 1995 proposed the weather type wt correction coefficient to calibrate the hs equation so it can be adjusted according to the local meteorological characteristics of different regions four weather types have been defined in their study namely sunny cloudy overcast and rain the correction coefficient of a weather type can be derived by comparing the daily et0 value calculated by the hs method with the multi year average of daily et0 for forecast period the equation for the adjusted hs method eq 3 is expressed as follows 3 e t 0 i γ i e t 0 i where e t 0 i is the ith daily et0 calculated by the hs method mm day 1 γ i is the ith weather type correction coefficient e t 0 i is the multi year average of daily et0 calculated by the hs method mm day 1 the adjusted hs method was used to compare and evaluate the performance of the hybrid bi lstm model in this study 2 4 development of hybrid bi directional long short term memory bi lstm model and its components 2 4 1 long short term memory lstm the core idea of the long short term memory lstm is to replace every hidden unit in recurrent neural network rnn with a cell of memory function hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 basically it is a variant of rnn model and can be adapted to achieve excellent performance in processing time series data graves 2013 graves et al 2013 sutskever et al 2014 in order to solve the problem of gradient disappearance gradient expansion and error hindrance in the traditional lstm an extended memory block with a memory cell is applied to the lstm gers et al 1999 the memory cell can keep the historical data in the memory and wake it up in any epoch when needed fig 2 illustrates the operating mechanism and internal memory cell of the lstm where ct 1 is the memory unit of the network at the previous time step t 1 ct is the state of memory at time t ht is the output of hidden state at time t ht 1 is a vector containing the values of the output by each memory in the hidden layer at the previous time step t 1 or at the initial hidden state xt is the input at time t forget gate input gate cell gate and output gate units are denoted by ft it c t and ot respectively the memory cell learns at the t time based on the input at the t time and the output at the t 1 time in the network the detail algorithm involved in the components of the memory cell is described as follows eqs 4 9 4 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 5 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 6 c t t a n h w c h t 1 x t b c 7 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 8 o t s o f t s i g n w o h t 1 x t b o 9 h t o t r e l u c t where wf wi wc and wo are weight matrices of the forget gate input gate cell gate and output gate units respectively bf bi bc and bo are the bias vectors of the forget gate input gate cell gate and output gate units respectively σ is the classical sigmoid activation function of the forget gate and input gate units the activation functions of the cell gate unit output gate unit and output are denoted by tanh softsign and relu respectively in comparison to the traditional method proposed by liption et al 2015 two activation functions in the lstm output gate stage were modified in this study first modification is to replace σ activation function with softsign activation function which can increase the speed of model training the other modification is the use of rectified linear unit relu activation function instead of the σ which can make the network to dynamically control the time scale and the forgetting behavior of different units 2 4 2 bi directional lstm bi lstm model bi lstm is composed of bi directional recurrent neural networks bi rnn and the long short term memory lstm which is a standard neural network byeon et al 2015 schuster and paliwal 1997 the concept of bi rnn is that each training sequence has forward and backward rnn and both of them are connected with an output layer fig 3 each point in the input sequence of the output layer is provided with the complete past and future contextual information there is no information flow between the forward and the backward implied layers which ensures that the expansion graph is non cycle however bi rnn has been exposed to the drawbacks of gradient explosion and information morphing when backpropagation is carried out therefore bi lstm is generated in this case to solve the problem of gradient explosion and information morphing abdelhameed et al 2018 besides it can efficiently process the sequential data composed of time instances graves and schmidhuber 2005 hu and zhang 2018 the structure of the bi lstm model is shown in fig 3 where w i i 1 2 6 are the six independent weight matrices as follows input to forward and backward hidden layer weights w 1 w 3 hidden layer to hidden layer weights w 2 w 5 forward and backward hidden layer to output layer weights w 4 w 6 these six weights are used repeatedly at each time step the hidden layer of the bi lstm model needs to save two values of h t in which h t involves in the forward calculation and h t involves in the backward calculation the final output value ot obtained by combining the outputs of the forward layer and the backward layer which can be expressed mathematically eqs 10 12 as follows 10 h t f w 1 x t w 2 h t 1 11 h t f w 3 x t w 5 h t 1 12 o t g w 4 h t w 6 h t 2 4 3 hybrid bi lstm model in order to improve the goodness of fit between the forecasted daily et0 from the bi lstm model and the pm method daily et0 the forecast value of the bi lstm model was processed by an artificial neural network ann shortly referred to as hybrid bi lstm model in this study in general an ann is composed of an input layer hidden layers and an output layer based on a network of artificial neurons connected by weights the ann used in this study has only one hidden layer which is also a classical neural network structure ferreira et al 2019 as demonstrated by maier et al 2010 the structure of the ann needs to be formulated according to the specific tasks therefore the input of the ann was determined by the output of the bi lstm model for this study in order to improve the accuracy of forecast the output of the bi lstm model was divided into 12 monthly sequences prior to ingest as input into the ann hence the ann has 12 input neurons and the number of neurons in the hidden layer are obtained by a trial and error procedure finally the ann network of 12 36 12 was found to be the most appropriate structure in which 12 neuron inputs are divided by 12 monthly vector groups according to the values forecasted by the bi lstm model with the length of 31 for each neuron and the default missing value is 1 fig 4 shows the architecture of the ann model and the final calculation formula of the output is expressed in eq 13 13 y i j 1 36 w j i 2 σ i 1 12 w i j 1 r i b 1 b 2 where r i and y i are the input and output vectors respectively σ is the activation function b 1 and b 2 are the bias units of the first and second layers respectively w i j 1 is the weight vector of the first layer from the neuron i to the neuron j w j i 2 is the weight vector of the second layer from the neuron j to the neuron i the weights of the ann model were initialized to a random number of gaussian distribution with the mean value of 0 and the variance of 0 01 and the bias was initialized to 1 the stochastic gradient descent via the back propagation algorithm was used to update the weights and bias between each layer of the model to avoid extremely small weighting factors and convergence problems during the training of the ann all the input and output variables were standardized according to the eq 14 14 x n i x μ σ where x n i is the normalized dimensionless variable x is the observed value μ is the mean of the sample data σ is the standard deviation of the sample data all these models were implemented in the python programming language with the tensorflow 1 2 an open source platform for machine learning and ubuntu 16 04 operating system fig 5 demonstrates the working procedure of the hybrid bi lstm model to forecast daily et0 the bi lstm model was obtained by initializing the two lstm cells by calling the tf nn bidirectional dynamic rnn function in the tensorflow when initializing the lstm cell the activation function selects the relu activation and provides the value of lstm dim parameter the lstm dim parameter represents the number of hidden layer cells and the number of notes that can remember and store generally the value of the lstm dim parameter is 100 or 150 two bi lstm models with hidden layer of 100 and 150 were trained and the experimental results showed that lstm dim 150 is the best option for this study to prevent overfitting and gradient vanishing from joining dropouts during the training and validation phases of the hybrid bi lstm model an optimization algorithm called adam was applied to update the network weight and bias considering the root mean square error rmse as the overall fitness function in the program the model training was terminated when the value of rmse function is no longer updated when the model was initialized the weight and bias values jozefowicz et al 2015 were set to 0 5 and 1 0 respectively the final hyperparameters of the hybrid bi lstm model with the three input combinations used in this study are listed in table 2 the learning rate is the learning efficiency of the network batch size is the number of samples per batch weight decay represents the l2 regularization coefficient dropout is the quantity ratio of randomly selected training samples to the total samples epochs is the number of iterations to obtain the optimal model 2 5 model performance evaluation to evaluate the performance of the models the following five statistical indicators were used gocic et al 2016 1 accuracy 15 a c c u r a c y a n 100 accuracy eq 15 was used to assess the accuracy of the temperature forecasts where a is the number of days that forecast the temperatures correctly while n is the total number of days root mean square error eq 16 mean absolute error eq 17 pearson correlation coefficient eq 18 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency eq 19 were calculated as follows 2 root mean square error rmse 16 r m s e i 1 n x i y i 2 n 3 mean absolute error mae 17 m a e i 1 n x i y i n 4 pearson correlation coefficient r 18 r i 1 n x i x i y i y i i 1 n x i x i 2 i 1 n y i x i 2 1 r 1 5 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 19 n s e 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 n s e 1 where x i and y i denote the forecasted and the observed daily et0 values at the ith time step respectively n is the sample size x i and y i represent the corresponding mean et0 values for the comparison of the temperature forecast x i and y i are the temperature forecast of the hybrid bi lstm model and temperature forecast downloaded from weather china respectively for the comparison of the daily et0 x i and y i are the et0 values forecasted by the hybrid bi lstm model and the et0 values computed by the pm method respectively pearson correlation coefficient r value closer to 1 0 indicates the greater goodness of fit between forecasted and the observed values nse value of 1 0 signifies a perfect match of forecasted values to the observed values nse values of zero indicates that the forecast values are as accurate as the mean of the observed values while nse less than zero highlight the poor performance of the forecast model moriasi et al 2007 nash and sutcliffe 1970 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance analysis of maximum temperature and minimum temperature forecasts by the hybrid bi lstm model the maximum temperature and the minimum temperature are highly correlated with et0 and two important meteorological inputs of the model therefore the accuracy of temperature forecast is the key factor to determine the accuracy of et0 forecast in the following steps antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 the model performance indicators namely accuracy mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and pearson correlation coefficient r of the forecast of the daily maximum tmax and the daily minimum temperature tmin in 1 7 days lead time are shown in fig 6 accordingly the range of the pearson correlation coefficient 0 8 0 94 signifies higher linear correlation between the forecast value and the observed value of both the tmax and the tmin over the 1 7 days forecast lead time at the three meteorological stations however the overall trend of the four statistical indicators fig 6 the forecast performance of both the tmax and the tmin are decreasing with increasing forecast lead time remarkably the rate of declining of forecast performances for both the tmax and the tmin were substantially greater in 4 day lead time than any other days this finding is common phenomenon in numerical weather forecasting regardless of forecasting tools and methodologies li et al 2018 mariotti et al 2018 xiong et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 moreover all the performance indicators for the forecast of the tmin are better than that of the tmax in all three meteorological stations for example the accuracy of the tmin was higher than the tmax by 3 2 13 3 over the 1 7 days forecast lead time the mae and rmse of the tmin were lower than the tmax by 0 9 17 9 and 5 3 23 1 respectively furthermore the best forecast performance for the tmax and the tmin were observed at yc and zn meteorological stations respectively the mae values of the forecast of both the tmax and the tmin were less than 2 over the 1 7 days forecast lead time at the three meteorological stations fig 6b 6f which satisfies the acceptable standard of the prediction bias of the temperature forecast thornes 1996 cma 2005 hence the performance of hybrid bi lstm model to forecast tmax and tmin are acceptable and can better support the forecast of et0 3 2 performance analysis of et0 forecasts with different input combinations by the hybrid bi lstm model here the three different input combinations table 1 namely x 1 t t m a x t t m i n t x 2 t t m a x t t m i n t h t w t t and x 3 t t m a x t t m i n t h t were separately ingested to the hybrid bi lstm to forecast the daily et0 over the 1 7 day lead time during the training validation and testing periods and the best input combination was selected in all the instances the short term daily et0 forecasted by the hybrid bi lstm model was compared against the daily et0 calculated by the pm method which was considered as the standard method to assess the performance of the hybrid bi lstm model table 3 presents the performance of the hybrid bi lstm model to forecast the short term daily et0 during the model training validation and testing accordingly the third input combination x 3 t that consists of tmax tmin and h showed the highest performance among the three input combinations based on the fact that this combination showed lowest mae and rmse and highest r values table 3 moreover the results indicated that the performance of the hybrid bi lstm model is greater during the model testing than that in the model training and validation which highlights the robustness of the model these results further revealed the fact that increasing the number of meteorological variables may not always improve the accuracy of the daily et0 forecast in deep learning models this was consistent with the findings of antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 ferreira and da cunha 2020 and patil and deka 2016 in all these previous studies less than four meteorological variables have been used to estimate et0 with the sufficient accuracy in contrast shiri 2018 and tikhamarine et al 2019 proposed more than four meteorological variables to estimate et0 with acceptable level of accuracy using machine learning methods these meteorological variables included maximum temperature minimum temperature dewpoint temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation these findings further prove that the air temperature is an indispensable variable to forecast the et0 using deep learning and machine learning techniques the unique outcome of this study is the applicability of the sunshine duration with the maximum and minimum temperatures to better forecast the daily et0 instead of the use of solar radiation which may not be available in the meteorological stations with the limited infrastructure moreover site specificity also plays a role in the selection of different meteorological variables as inputs to estimate the et0 for example input combination of maximum air temperature wind speed and solar radiation was appropriate to estimate monthly et0 in the low altitude while a five input combination maximum and minimum air temperatures relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation was required in the high altitude malik et al 2019 however this study showed the highest performance for the input combination of maximum temperature minimum temperature and sunshine duration across the three meteorological stations figs 7 9 show the performance of the hybrid bi lstm model to forecast the daily et0 during the model testing in different forecast lead time the daily et0 forecasts are plotted against the daily et0 calculated by the pm method under different combinations of meteorological inputs in the lead time of 1 day fig 7 4 day fig 8 and 7 day fig 9 it can be noticed that the overall trend of the daily et0 forecast by the hybrid bi lstm model was consistent with the daily et0 values calculated by the pm method which reflects the ability of the hybrid bi lstm model to represent the temporal variability of the daily et0 over the course of the year when the forecasted daily et0 values averaged across the forecast lead times the hybrid bi lstm model overestimated the daily et0 by 21 6 under the input combination of x 1 t while underestimated the daily et0 by 16 4 under the input combination of x 2 t the third input combination x 3 t underestimated the daily et0 by 8 4 but had the lowest bias among the input combinations evaluated in this study the trend of these biases becomes more and more obvious with the increase of forecast lead time as a result of decreasing forecast performance with increasing lead time li et al 2018 mariotti et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 additionaly incoporation of weather type wt did not improve the forecast accuracy this could be because the meteorological factor wt only considers four weather types sunny cloudy overcast and rain while the actual weather types are diverse and dynamic in nature which may lead to improper correction results during the complex weather types thus affects the forecast performance therefore the hybrid bi lstm model with the third input combination x 3 t was selected as the final model to forecast short term daily et0 it signifies the strong influence of both the maximum and minimum temperatures in et0 forecasting while the sunshine duration also has a non ignorable contribution to better forecast the daily et0 using deep learning methods in the following section the hybrid bi lstm model with the third input combination was used to forecast short term daily et0 for the period of 2016 2018 at the three meteorological stations and the forecast performance was compared with the short term daily et0 forecast of the adjusted hs method this is because the hs method has been identified as one of the potential methods to estimate the daily et0 when meteorological variables are limited allen et al 1998 droogers and allen 2002 hargreaves and allen 2003 xu and singh 2002 3 3 comparison of the forecasted short term daily et0 by the hybrid bi lstm model with the adjusted hs method the performance indicators of the hybrid bi lstm model and the adjusted hs method to forecast short term daily et0 in three meteorological stations compared to the daily et0 calculated by the pm method is shown in table 4 results showed higher performance for the hybrid bi lstm model than the adjusted hs method in all the meteorological stations this can be noted from both the lower mae and rmse and higher r and nse showed by the hybrid bi lstm model compared to the adjusted hs method table 4 irrespective of forecast methods increasing mae and rmse and decreasing r and nse with increasing forecast lead time once again prove the declining forecast skill with increasing lead time mariotti et al 2018 xiong et al 2016 moreover it can be noted that the nse values of the hybrid bi lstm model at the three meteorological stations yc tx and zn were consistent and the difference of the mae rmse and r across the stations were less than 8 5 nonetheless the adjusted hs method had lower nse and r values with the larger variations for mae and rmse across different meteorological stations this result showed that the hybrid bi lstm model is superior to the adjusted hs method in terms of accuracy and stability of the daily et0 forecast the relationship between short term daily et0 forecast by the hybrid bi lstm model and the adjusted hs method in comparison to the calculated daily et0 by the pm method were illustrated in figs 10 12 overall the hybrid bi lstm model showed greater performance than the adjusted hs method to forecast of short term daily et0 in all three meteorological stations this result is in agreement with shiri 2017 and yang et al 2019 where the authors argued that the performance of the deep learning methods to estimate the et0 are better than that of the hs method especially in the arid and sub arid regions furthermore the average forecast performance of the daily et0 at yanchi station was highest and followed by tongxin station and zhongning station table 4 figs 10 12 this is consistent with the performance of the temperature forecast by the hybrid bi lstm model section 3 1 when the statistical indicators are averaged across the three meteorological stations and forecast lead time the summarized performance indicators of the hybrid bi lstm model and the adjusted hs method were rmse 0 241 0 312 mm day 1 mae 0 068 0 114 mm day 1 r 0 969 0 954 and nse 0 985 0 983 respectively 3 4 evaluation of the effectiveness of the hybrid bi lstm model with a general bi lstm model in order to evaluate the effectiveness of integrating bi lstm model and ann called as hybrid bi lstm model in this study over the general bi lstm model the general bi lstm model was trained validated and tested using the same datasets table 5 shows the statistical indicators for the forecast of the daily et0 by the general bi lstm model in comparison to the daily et0 calculated by the pm method during model testing at the three meteorological stations the input combinations were kept the same which includes maximum air temperature minimum air temperature and sunshine duration the performance indicators have clearly shown the effectiveness of the hybrid bi lstm model model integration over the general bi lstm model in any lead time of the forecast horizon within 7 days tables 4 5 this can be observed from the substantially lower mae and rmse and substantially higher nse and r values obtained for the hybrid bi lstm model than the general bi lstm model tables 4 5 therefore the integration or hybridization of models is far better than using a single model to forecast meteorological variables this finding is in support of the works reported by agarap 2018 azimi et al 2016 meshram et al 2019 and zhang et al 2019 compared with the hybrid machine learning method proposed by tikhamarine et al 2019 to estimate monthly et0 this study proposes not only the integration of the general bi lstm with an artificial neural network ann but also the organic construction of the two different models to forecast short term daily et0 to optimize the irrigation for precision agriculture it is necessary to calculate the crop water demand with high accuracy reference evapotranspiration et0 serves as an important input to estimate crop water demand and plan for irrigation scheduling hunsaker et al 2003 currently biases in et0 estimation resulted by incomplete or missing meteorological data significantly affects the accuracy of the estimation of crop water demands however these constraints can be solved by developing tools with model integration and artificial intelligence as highlighted in this study these tools have greater potential to be adapted in agricultural water management ballesteros et al 2016 mattar 2018 saggi and jain 2019 sherafatpour et al 2019 especially with the curent development of internet of things iot in agriculture the hybrid bi lstm model developed in this study is currently integrated into the modern intelligent irrigation system of 30 ha of lycium barbarum plantation in central ningxia china as a solution for the lack of meteorological data 4 conclusions reference evapotranspiration et0 is an essential meteorological variable to compute crop water requirements to optimize irrigation in precision agriculture although the penman monteith method is used as the standard to estimate the et0 allen et al 1998 this method is not applicable in data scarce regions as it requires large number of meteorological variables to overcome this problem the hybrid bi lstm model was developed to forecast short term 1 7 day lead time daily et0 the hybrid bi lstm model was trained validated and tested using the meteorological variables for the period of 2006 2018 at the three meteorological stations located in the semi arid region of central ningxia china the performance of the hybrid bi lstm model to forecast short term daily et0 was evaluated against the daily et0 calculated by the penman monteith method using the statistical indicators namely mae rmse pearson correlation coefficient r and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse additionally the hybrid bi lstm model was compared with the adjusted hs method and general bi lstm model the following conclusions can be derived from this study 1 the performance of the hybrid bi lstm model with a combination of three meteorological inputs maximum temperature minimum temperature and sunshine duration was superior to the corresponding other input combinations and the adjusted hs method to forecast short term daily et0 2 sunshine duration data showed higher correlation with the et0 than that of the solar radiation in the studied locations hence adding sunshine duration as the input to the hybrid bi lstm model in addition to the maximum and minimum temperatures has improved the accuracy of the daily et0 forecast when radiation data is missing or inaccurate sunshine duration data could be used to forecast daily et0 in the arid and semi arid regions however the use of weather type as input to the hybrid bi lstm model reduces the forecast accuracy of short term daily et0 3 the hybrid bi lstm model substantially improved the performance of short term daily et0 forecast over the general bi lstm model as a result of the integration of general bi lstm model with an artificial neural network ann which enabled to account for both physical and big data characteristics of meteorological data to forecast daily et0 4 the forecast accuracy of short term daily et0 declines with increasing forecast lead time regardless of forecast models and locations since the hybrid bi lstm model was developed in the semi arid region of northwest china this model may not be directly applied to the other climatic regions in the world however the proposed methodology and data management is expected to be transferable to other regions especially with limited meteorological observations future works should focus the evaluation of the performance of the hybrid bi lstm model in comparison to other deep learning approaches across a wide range of climatic conditions to confirm the broad applicability of the model to forecast short

10456,hybrid maize model was evaluated for its performance for simulating maize growth grain yield soil water content swc and crop evapotranspiration etc under full irrigation treatment fit limited irrigation 50 60 and 75 of fit and rainfed using long term 2005 2010 and field measured data in nebraska usa current version of the hybrid maize model was found to be unsatisfactory for estimating maize growth and water balance components or grain yield in most cases significant differences p 0 05 were observed between model estimated vs field measured variables leaf area index lai was simulated with modest accuracy for most of the irrigated treatments with a normalized root mean squared error nrmse 16 in 2009 and 30 in 2010 in which a trend of underestimation was observed the model simulated early season biomass well in 2010 but overpredicted in 2009 and underpredicted in 2010 during the late season the total seasonal biomass for both years was simulated with very high overall nrmse of 20 2 and mean prediction error mpe of 0 28 the swc estimates by the model were highly unsatisfactory in almost all treatments and years with negative ef values and high nrmses ranging from 47 to 62 this bias in swc prediction resulted in significant p 0 05 underestimation of seasonal etc by the model in all years and treatments the difference in simulated and field measured etc varied from 46 mm to as high as 167 mm corresponding to the prediction error pe range of 7 7 28 with pooled data nrmse of 16 2 these are very high etc estimation errors that can result in significant challenges if the model is used for predicting water supply demand and use analyses or in season irrigation management the final grain yield was simulated with moderate accuracy in some cases and poorly in other cases with up 1 2 mg ha of underestimation for fit 2 mg ha of overestimation for limited irrigation treatment and up to 5 7 mg ha underestimation for rainfed conditions with a pooled data r2 of 0 69 nrmse of 14 and ef value of 0 57 overall model estimates were inconsistent for the same variables treatments between the years additional improvements in the model to add additional soil layers input capability may aid in more representative accurate estimates of swc the highest discrepancies between simulated and measured data were observed for rainfed treatments indicating unsuitability of the model in rainfed dry regions and in irrigated conditions for most variables and the need for model improvements in conditions of water stress for most of the variables investigated additional model improvements using carefully measured field data are suggested keywords biomass crop model leaf area index limited irrigation model performance evapotranspiration soil water water use 1 introduction maize is one of the most widely distributed and utilized crops in the world with global production of nearly 1100 million metric tons usda fas 2019 approximately one third of the world maize is produced in the unites states the midwestern united states accounts for the highest maize production with iowa illinois and nebraska being the top three maize producing states in 2018 increasing demands for food feed and fuel due to increasing global population would require even more substantial increases in food production while protecting natural resources and using input resources water nitrogen pesticides land etc as efficiently as possible thus increasing crop yield potential with limited resources is currently a significant challenge for the scientific community policy and decision makers planners as well as producers and other agricultural professionals light temperature nitrogen and availability of water are considered as the most crucial factors determining yield cirilo and andrade 1994 proper management of input resources particularly irrigation water is necessary to maximize yields as well as profits for farmers however the growing competition for limited water resources will continue reduce its availability for irrigation additionally increasing pumping costs low crop prices and inadequate irrigation system capacities prompt growers to reduce irrigation water use to improve crop productivity craciun and craciun 1995 especially in many of the water limiting regions adoption of appropriate crop production and water management strategies such as deficit or limited irrigation can be viable means to reduce irrigation water use while maintaining the yield potential pandey et al 2000 irmak 2015a b deficit irrigation allows moderate water stress at vegetative and maturity stages and ensures appropriate moisture during water sensitive growth stages of flowering and yield formation kang et al 2000 limited irrigation allows limited amount of water to be distributed equally or unequally in each irrigation which can result in reduction in terms of the impact of water stress on crop growth and development and yield and can also improve crop water productivity especially in regions in which irrigation is practiced as a supplementary source of water to precipitation irmak 2015a b the information related to such crop production practices have been traditionally obtained by using conventional approach based on agronomic and agricultural engineering research in which crop production functions are developed from statistical analysis the qualitative observations and quantitative information obtained from the field experiments have been used to understand the underlying principles for different crop processes and aid in agricultural decision making however in addition to time and financial constraints site specific field research may limit its results applicability to other sites with varying climatic soil and crop management conditions thus widely applicable agricultural research is required to provide information to growers and managers about sustainable agricultural practices over a wide range of climatic variations in this direction the use of crop models can be a viable strategy if models are properly calibrated and validated to produce relevant accurate and robust consistent and repeatable estimates crop growth simulation models are computer programs that integrate the current knowledge about plant growth and development processes from variety of disciplines including crop science agronomy physiology soil science agricultural engineering and agrometeorology to imitate the behavior of crop s growth development yield and other variables they are applied in crop management research teaching yield forecasts policy analysis and decision making but their use is primarily in academic setting and their applications in practical applications for decision making by growers has been limited the development of crop models dates back to 1960s starting with simple water balance models for the development of plant growth simulation models in the 1980s oteng darko et al 2013 the first attempt to model photosynthetic rates of crop canopies was made in the 1960s de wit 1965 followed by development of models based on linkages between photosynthesis and respiration de wit 1978 over time advances in understanding of plant physiological processes and their relations to plant growth functions radiation use efficiency stress and environmental inputs have led to construction of numerous crop models such as sucros van laar et al 1997 wofost boogaard et al 1998 ceres ritchie 1998 epic williams et al 1984 dssat jones et al 2003 and others the extensive overview of several crop modelling approaches is given by van ittersum et al 2003 the selection of a particular crop model depends on the purpose of application ease of use availability of required input data and information accuracy and robustness although there are several models available for maize including dssat jones et al 2003 intercom kropff and van laar 1993 stics brisson et al 2003 and most of the models require highly detailed input data hybrid specific information including genetic information complicated to use or lack comprehensive user support documentation to run the model therefore a simple but reliable crop simulation model is required for estimating maize yields evaluating management options and decision making with good accuracy however knowledge in terms of model s simplicity and its accuracy must be carefully investigated validated to provide information about their suitability or unsuitability for different conditions in this research the hybrid maize model yang et al 2004 is selected as it is simple user friendly fast and requires relatively fewer input parameters as compared with other crop models the simplicity of the model is considered as an advantage as not all input variables required by the model can be measured in the field experiments moreover the hybrid maize model is based on synthesis of two major types of crop modelling approaches combining crop specific attributes related to phenology and organ growth from ceres maize jones et al 1986 with explicit photosynthesis and respiration functions from assimilate driven generic crop models such as sucros wofost and intercom kropff and van laar 1993 van diepen et al 1989 van ittersum et al 2003 the model has been used in simulating maize yield at field scale grassini et al 2009 yang et al 2004 as well as regional scale liu et al 2015 to assess yield potential and yield gaps farmaha et al 2016 van ittersum et al 2016 yield forecasting morell et al 2016 evaluate crop management options chen et al 2011 meng et al 2013 nutrient management setiyono et al 2011 water productivity grassini et al 2009 and climate change impacts cassman et al 2010 however the performance of the model has not yet been evaluated sufficiently under varying amounts of water stress over the growing season using long term data from carefully conducted field research besides the validations have been performed under either rainfed or fully irrigated conditions in the available literature most importantly the model performance relative to soil water balance components including root zone soil water content and crop evapotranspiration is lacking which are the major factors influencing grain yield moreover the recent improvements in the hybrid maize model yang et al 2017 to improve its performance under water stress conditions also require comprehensive evaluation of the model including for the conditions in which it was calibrated for as the hybrid maize model was developed for the usa corn belt and has already been calibrated for the nebraska conditions the major guiding principle of this research was to evaluate the efficacy of the model in simulating maize parameters using the calibrated parameters coefficients and only altering the management specific variables the specific objectives of this research were to evaluate the performance of the hybrid maize model relative to i crop growth parameters such as leaf area index and aboveground biomass ii water use components including crop evapotranspiration and soil water and iii grain yield under full irrigation limited irrigation and rainfed conditions in a transition zone between sub humid and semi arid climatic conditions in nebraska usa 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiments description the field experiments that generated all the input data for model runs were conducted in the irmak research laboratory s advanced irrigation engineering plant physiology climate science and evapotranspiration research facilities at the university of nebraska s unl south central agricultural laboratory scal near cay center nebraska usa irmak 2015a b scal is located at 40 34 n and 98 8 w at an elevation of 552 m above mean sea level it is in a transition zone between sub humid and semi arid climatic zones with strong winds and hot and dry summers with high vapor pressure deficit especially during july and august the site receives approximately 730 mm of annual precipitation on long term average basis with significant inter annual and inter growing season variation in magnitude and timing irmak 2015a the soil at the site is a hastings silt loam which is a well drained upland soil fine montmorillonitic mesic udic argiustoll with a 0 5 north south slope direction having field capacity of 0 34 m3 m 3 permanent wilting point of 0 14 m3 m 3 and saturation point of 0 53 m3 m 3 the particle size distribution is 15 sand 65 silt and 20 clay with a 2 5 organic matter content in the topsoil the typical effective rooting depth of maize at the site is 1 20 1 50 m irmak 2015a b the field research data collection and detailed experimental procedures were outlined in irmak 2015a b and will not be repeated here briefly the experiments were conducted from 2005 to 2010 growing seasons and the field 16 5 ha was planted to maize with the same or hybrids with very similar genetic backgrounds every year with planting population of 73 000 plants ha with a planting depth of 0 05 m the experimental design was a completely randomized design with three replications and each replication plot was 1 ha in size there were four irrigation treatments including fully irrigated treatment fit limited irrigation treatments 75 fit 60 fit and 50 fit and rainfed control treatment the field was irrigated using a four span hydraulic and continuous move center pivot irrigation system t l irrigation hastings nebraska irrigation was triggered based on the soil water content of fit same treatments were enforced in all six years except for 2005 which was the first year when the center pivot system was purchased installed and operated therefore in 2005 only fit and rainfed treatments were implemented the entire field received uniform application of fertilizers and pesticides when needed irmak 2015a b the summary information on agronomic field management practices is provided table 1 irmak 2015a b 2 2 sampling and measurements the sampling area for each treatment plot in all replications was eight rows wide and 15 2 m long with a row spacing of 0 76 m plant height was measured on a weekly basis by selecting ten plants randomly from each replication and treatment throughout the growing season from crop emergence until physiological maturity plants were sampled in 1 m2 sections from each replication randomly to quantify the biomass production over time samples were taken every one or two weeks differed among growing seasons and dried at 70 c until they reached a constant weight and were weighed to quantify dry matter production leaf area index lai was measured on a weekly or ten day period using a leaf canopy analyzer model li cor 2000 licor biosciences lincoln neb several lai readings were recorded from each treatment plot and replication during the entire growing season daily treatment mean lai was calculated from all measurements for each treatment the replication data were used to calculate standard deviation for lai grain yield was determined by hand harvesting the center two rows over 15 2 m of each plot and was adjusted to 15 5 grain moisture content irmak 2015a b the volumetric soil water content swc was measured using a troxler model 4300 neutron probe troxler electronics laboratories research triangle park nc up to soil depth of 1 80 m at increments of 0 30 m on a weekly or biweekly basis in all treatments these swc measurements were used in irrigation management and soil water balance calculations the seasonal crop evapotranspiration was calculated using the following soil water balance equation 1 etc p i u r d δsws where etc is crop evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is irrigation water applied mm u is upward soil water flux mm assumed zero because the groundwater depth is approximately 33 m below the surface r is surface run off mm d is deep percolation from the crop root zone mm and δsws is change in soil water storage in the soil profile mm from the beginning to the end of the growing season the surface run off from each treatment was calculated using the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service curve number method united states department of agriculture soil conservation service usda nrcs 1985 deep percolation was calculated using a daily water balance computer program written in microsoft visual basic as mentioned in djaman and irmak 2012 using the data of swc below 1 50 m depth inputs to the program included weather variables of air temperature solar radiation relative humidity wind speed rainfall irrigation dates and amounts initial soil water at emergence and crop and site specific information such as planting date maturity date soil parameters and maximum crop rooting depth the plant measurements including lai plant height and biomass were taken during 2009 and 2010 growing seasons while phenological stage observations yield and swc measurements were performed in all six growing seasons 2005 2010 irmak 2015a b 2 3 hybrid maize model hybrid maize is a crop simulation model that describes maize growth and development relative to weather soil properties and management factors using set of mathematical formulations it simulates maize growth under non limiting as well as water limited conditions based on daily weather data it allows for the assessment of a given site s yield potential evaluation of yield changes due to different crop management practices in season and future crop growth and yield simulations and exploration of irrigation management options the model has mostly been evaluated in rainfed and irrigated maize systems yang et al 2004 the hybrid maize model combines the strengths of two modelling approaches incorporating the crop specific attributes such as phenology and plant organ growth from ceres maize jones et al 1986 kiniry et al 1997 and explicit photosynthesis and respiration functions from generic crop models like sucros wofost and intercom van diepen et al 1989 van ittersum et al 2003 the hybrid maize model also includes modifications for several functions obtained from model calibration procedures using field experiments data conducted under minimum possible stress conditions yang et al 2004 the model is more responsive to changes in environmental conditions than ceres maize due to inclusion of gross assimilation growth and maintenance respiration functions it requires fewer hybrid specific input parameters assuming without sacrificing the prediction accuracy for instance the model uses linear relationship between growing degree days gdd to anthesis and gdd to maturity for predicting anthesis as the information about gdd to maturity is readily available for most commercial hybrids the model has a windows based user interface with full text and graphical display climate data utility to import online weather data and allows exporting simulation results it can be used for single season or long term simulations using multi year climate data for a given site the detailed descriptions of major crop processes and model components is provided by yang et al 2004 in this research the latest version of the hybrid maize model i e hm2016 was used this version has been revised from earlier 2006 version hm2006 with regards to root distribution canopy expansion and senescence in response to crop water deficit kernel setting surface runoff soil evaporation and crop transpiration estimation of soil water content at sowing based on simulation of water balance during the fallow period and new batch run function to better simulate yields in harsh rainfed environments yang et al 2017 these improvements are suggested assumed to make the revised hybrid maize model more robust in simulating maize yields over a wide range of environments and field conditions 2 4 model parameters input data the performance of hybrid maize model was evaluated using datasets measured in five treatments fit 75 fit 60 fit 50 fit and rainfed that were imposed in six research years from 2005 to 2010 with diverse variations of weather parameters within a single season as well as among different growing seasons this provided an ideal opportunity to evaluate model s performance response to different crop and irrigation management strategies in different climatic conditions moreover the availability of a wide range of crop growth and water use parameters measured in the field allows for the comprehensive evaluation of the model 2 4 1 weather soil and other measured field data the weather data including minimum and maximum air temperature minimum and maximum relative humidity wind speed solar radiation reference evapotranspiration and precipitation for the analyses were obtained from the nearby weather station that is a part of the high plains regional climate center hprcc automated weather station network which was located only about 2 km from the experimental field the weather data for the 2005 2010 years were used in the model to run simulations for simulation of different variables a single year simulation mode was selected for each growing season to estimate aforementioned variables for each year separately the soil at the site is a hastings silt loam and the maximum rooting depth of 150 cm was set which is usually recommended for the soils without any physical or chemical constraints to root growth the soil textures for the topsoil and sub soil were specified to be silt loam and clay loam respectively based on the field observations irmak 2010 the model contains default soil properties for each of these textural classes that is used for simulation of soil water balance and conversion between soil water pressure and soil water content the bulk density of topsoil usually ranges from 1 1 to 1 40 g cm3 and a value of 1 30 g cm3 was specified based on the soil texture and structure of the field under consideration irmak 2010 the model allows the users to set the soil moisture status either for the time of planting or for the start of a fallow period in this research soil moisture status was set at planting owing to considerable snowfall events in the research region during the fallow period due to significant snowfall and rainfall events before the onset of growing season the initial soil moisture in the field during planting is usually considered to be at field capacity the soil moisture in the topsoil and subsoil was adjusted for each growing season based on the field observations that ranged from 75 wet to 100 very wet of crop available water the soil surface coverage by crop residues varied between each growing season and was set accordingly that ranged from minimum of 5 to maximum of 40 this option allows for the accurate estimation of soil evaporation and surface runoff in the model finally the surface run off was calculated by the model using two user specified inputs including average field slope and soil drainage class the selected field has a field slope of 2 with good soil drainage and these parameters were selected to calculate runoff in the model 2 4 2 crop growth and development parameters in hybrid maize model all the important input parameters are transparent and accessible to users these parameters should be modified only in certain circumstances such as for testing the sensitivity of the model to changes in key parameters for simulation of maize hybrids that differ significantly from the common commercial hybrids used in model development and validation and for the situations for which model has not been developed or validated the current research was conducted in same location i e nebraska and for a similar maize hybrid for which the model has been developed and validated thus the need for re calibration of parameters as opposed to those developed by yang et al 2004 would be unnecessary therefore in this research the conservative crop growth respiration and photosynthesis parameters developed by yang et al 2004 were retained and used in the validation reported here to further evaluate the performance and robustness of the model these parameters include general physiological coefficients used in functions to describe crop growth and development more information on deriving these parameters is given in yang et al 2004 2017 while hereafter some of the modified and user specific parameters are briefly described the default sowing depth was altered in the parameter settings from 4 cm to 5 cm based on the actual planting depth during the field experiments the hybrid specific parameters are the brand specific parameters that describe the computation of starting time for growing degree days gdd minimum and maximum of relative maturity ratings and the coefficients of linear regression of total gdd to gdd to silking and the coefficients of linear regression of gdd to silking to total gdd in this research only the information about days to relative maturity was available in such scenarios where gdd to silking data is not available the generic brand coefficients can be used to estimate the gdd to silking thus the regression functions for generic brand were selected for this research the crop management information related to date of planting and planting population density were obtained from the field experiments irmak 2015a b for each growing season and is given in table 1 irrigation amounts applied to each treatment in the field and dates were entered to specify the irrigation management finally for the analysis of all cropping seasons parameters simulation of growth in a single cropping season was selected as the simulation mode 2 5 data analyses to evaluate the model performance for simulating different field measured variables the field measured lai biomass grain yield soil water content and crop evapotranspiration were compared to the outputs simulated by the hybrid maize model the goodness of fit of the model was determined using a combination of statistical indicators including percent deviation pe normalized root mean squared error nrmse mean prediction error mpe nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ef and coefficient of determination r2 pe was used to assess percent deviation between measured and simulated variables relative to the measured values pe values approaching zero indicate better model performance and is calculated as 1 p e s i m i m i 100 where m i is the field measured observed value and s i represents simulated value pe was calculated for final above ground biomass crop evapotranspiration and grain yield brisson et al 2002 suggested that if pe values do not exceed 15 the simulation results can be considered acceptable for field crop research rmse is used to measure the magnitude of difference between simulated and observed values and ranges from 0 to positive infinity with 0 indicating good and infinity indicating poor model performance jacovides and kontoyiannis 1995 rmse is expressed in units of a given variable and it can be normalized using the mean of the measured variables and is known as normalized root mean squared error nrmse which is then expressed as a percentage 2 r m s e i 1 n s i m i 2 n 3 n r m s e r m s e m 100 where m is the mean of measured values the validation is considered excellent if nrmse is 10 good if it is between 10 and 20 acceptable if it is between 20 and 30 and poor for values 30 jamieson et al 1991 the ef measures the relative magnitude of the residual variance as compared with the variance of field

and field measured values for lai biomass etc grain yield and soil water content the null hypothesis was that there are no significant differences between simulated and measured variables mentioned above 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions the long term average growing season precipitation at the research site is 437 mm but the timing and magnitude of precipitation differ significantly across years and within the growing season the monthly growing season precipitation amounts for 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 growing seasons are presented in fig 1 the total growing season precipitation from planting until maturity amounts were 280 345 355 519 377 and 485 mm for 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 growing seasons respectively in general 2005 was the driest and 2008 was the wettest growing season among all six years resulting in highest and lowest irrigation water application respectively in these years the total irrigation amounts applied to full irrigation treatments in 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 were 280 241 132 51 178 and 127 mm respectively irrigation was usually initiated in late june to mid july that corresponded to the most water intensive stages of maize and was terminated around late august early to mid september the maximum mean temperature of 21 7 c from plating to silking was observed in 2006 growing season and the minimum of 18 1 c in 2009 growing season the maximum monthly average vapor pressure deficit vpd was observed in july 2005 followed by june 2006 2007 and 2008 and august 2009 and 2010 irmak 2015a these substantial differences in climatic variables between the growing seasons provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the model performance under dry normal and wet growing seasons 3 2 leaf area index the growth dynamics of maize including leaf area index lai and aboveground biomass were evaluated using the model and compared against the field measured data collected in 2009 and 2010 growing seasons the leaf area expansion and leaf senescence processes in hybrid maize model are similar to ceres maize model such that they are solely driven by air temperature until silking with adjustment of specific leaf area limited to 400 cm2 g 1 however in hybrid maize model leaf senescence is modified such that two phases of leaf senescence first phase from start of silking to beginning of effective grain filling and second phase from grain filling to physiological maturity in ceres maize were combined into one function for the whole growth period from grain filling to physiological maturity the graphical comparisons and goodness of fit parameters between the model simulated and field measured lai from emergence to physiological maturity are presented in fig 2 for 2009 and fig 3 for 2010 the hybrid maize model simulated lai with moderate to good accuracy for most of the irrigated treatments and the simulated values were in stronger agreement with the field measured values in 2009 growing season than in 2010 growing season the nrmses ranged from 12 5 to 26 4 in 2009 and from 22 6 to 38 9 in 2010 similarly lower mpe and higher ef values were obtained in 2009 as compared with 2010 with mpe ranging from 0 14 for fit to 0 35 for rainfed treatment in 2009 and from 0 84 for fit to 1 16 for rainfed treatment in 2010 and ef values ranged from 0 61 for fit to 0 88 for rainfed in 2009 and from 0 35 for fit to 0 51 for rainfed treatment in 2010 these statistical parameters indicate that the model performance declined with increase in water stress from fit to rainfed treatment also the model simulated accelerated senescence in rainfed treatment in 2009 and predicted that the crop prematurely senesced due to frost similarly the model predicted premature crop due to drought in 50 fit and rainfed treatment in 2010 resulting in early senescence however these situations did not have a pronounced impact on crop in the field as depicted by the field measured lai large discrepancies between measured and simulated lai during mid season were observed overall a trend of underestimation of lai was observed in 2010 especially after 72 days after planting dap that was close to the start of silking stage 81 dap as compared to 2009 lesser rainfall was received in 2010 during the maize reproductive growth stages indicating more stress in the 50 fit and rainfed treatments resulting in simulation of premature crop conditions by the model due to simulated drought but the impact of these dry periods was not indicated decline in field measured lai data statistical analysis table 2 indicated that there were no significant differences p 0 05 between field measured and model simulated values of lai in both 2009 and 2010 growing seasons except for the 50 fit treatment with p 0 05 in 2009 the results obtained in this research are comparable to those reported hybrid maize model simulated lai in the literature yang et al 2004 reported that hybrid maize simulated lai with ef values in range of 0 88 to 0 93 and mpe varied from 0 22 to 0 56 during growing seasons of 1999 to 2002 under optimum water and nutrient supply conditions but under different maize planting densities they also established that the model tends to underpredict lai during mid season when simulating lai under water deficit conditions yang et al 2017 indicated that the model simulated faster leaf area senescence during the last phase of grain filling in another study by liu et al 2012 the lai was reported to be simulated fairly well with nrmses in the range of 11 08 22 06 and mpes varying from 0 29 to 0 15 under both irrigated and rainfed conditions for two growing seasons hou et al 2014 evaluated the hybrid maize model after incorporating a module of plastic film mulching and reported nrmse of 20 for simulation of lai therefore our simulation results closely match with these reports except for the high discrepancies under extreme water stress conditions such as rainfed treatment in 2010 in which the model simulated lai showed large deviation from the field measured data with very high nrmse of 38 9 3 3 biomass production temperature is one of the major factors that drives leaf area development expansion which in turn drives the leaf biomass growth the comparative evaluations were made between measured and simulated development of above ground biomass from emergence to maturity for 2009 and 2010 growing seasons under all irrigation and rainfed treatments figs 4 and 5 the statistical indicators displaying the model efficacy in simulating the aboveground biomass are also presented on the figures as well the estimates of total end of the season above ground biomass are presented in fig 6 and the statistical indicators are presented in tables 2 and 3 the seasonal pattern of aboveground biomass production was simulated well by the hybrid maize model during early growth stages in both years and all treatments however the model differed in its prediction of biomass in late season such that the biomass development was simulated greater than the measured values in 2009 growing season in all treatments except for rainfed treatment in which the greatest disagreement between simulated and measured biomass nrmse 53 7 p 0 05 was observed except for the rainfed treatment in 2009 the model simulated values of biomass development over growing seasons were statistically similar to the field measured data p 0 05 the highest model ef of 0 95 and the lowest nrmse of 12 5 was obtained for fit except for the rainfed treatments this resulted in higher field measured final aboveground biomass table 2 than that predicted by the model as indicated by overall high mpe value of 0 28 mg ha table 3 this might be due to overestimation of lai during later crop growth stages i e from 115 dap to 140 dap in general the biomass development simulation in 2009 can be considered acceptable for irrigated treatments nrmses 20 ef 0 88 but not for the rainfed treatment ef 0 02 in 2010 the hybrid maize closely predicted the biomass accumulation over the growing season for fit 75 fit and 60 fit with high ef value of 0 99 mpe values less than 0 13 mg ha and nrmses less than 11 similar to 2009 growing season results the model was capable of predicting early season biomass development but differed from the field measured values during late season in 50 fit and rainfed treatment in which it was underestimated this results from early canopy closure predicted by the model resulting in premature crop due to drought stress the highest deviation between simulated and measured biomass development ef 0 86 mpe 1 2 mg ha and nrmse 31 8 as well as final aboveground biomass pe 33 9 was observed for the rainfed treatment essentially the final aboveground biomass was highly over predicted in 2009 and highly under predicted in 2010 with high pe values of up to 31 in 2009 and 34 in 2010 besides t test analysis indicated that final above ground biomass was significantly different p 0 05 from the model simulated biomass table 2 maize is more sensitive to water stress during silking and grain filling periods than other growth stages and the high bias in the model performance during these stages can give highly inaccurate estimates of grain yield as well as crop evapotranspiration results reported in the literature indicate similar findings as observed in this research yang et al 2004 observed the trend of biomass simulation as a part of the model validation study and reported that the hybrid maize closely predicted the aboveground biomass with ef 0 97 and absolute value of mpe in the range of 0 09 0 50 mg ha under optimal conditions in lincoln nebraska and manchester iowa these values are similar to those obtained in this current research except for the rainfed treatments that had higher bias and lower prediction accuracy in an attempt to improve model simulations under harsh rainfed environments modifications were introduced in the 2006 version of the model and the improved 2016 version hm2016 of the model was reported to be better in predicting seasonal dynamics of biomass production yang et al 2017 however in the current research the model estimates of aboveground biomass using hm2016 version under rainfed conditions did not improve and had the highest bias as compared with irrigated treatments contrarily liu et al 2012 reported good agreement between simulated and measured biomass under both irrigated and rainfed conditions with nrmses less than 22 however they obtained negative mpes as high as 2 6 mg ha in all treatments indicating significant overestimation of aboveground biomass by the model and suggested that this might occur because of unavoidable competition with weeds and damage by insects and pests in the field while overall the model estimates of aboveground biomass development can be considered as satisfactory for irrigated treatments the model estimates were poor for the rainfed conditions which suggest the need for further improvements in the model for accurately simulating biomass production which is critical for physiological phenological and other crop production vs environmental interactions analyses in this research no consistent trend in over or under estimation of total aboveground biomass was observed table 3 3 4 soil water content while soil moisture plays a vital role in crop production and many other related processes robust evaluation of model accuracy in predicting swc remains challenging in crop modeling efforts due to lack of good quality and sufficient field measured datasets accurate simulation of soil water content in the root zone is also critically important modelling soil water balance dynamics has always been a major challenge in water stressed as well as non water stressed environments in this research the hybrid maize model was evaluated for its ability to simulate swc in the crop root zone of 1 5 m for six individual growing seasons from 2005 to 2010 selected results relative to simulation of swc in the top two soil layers of 0 30 cm soil layer 1 sl1 and 30 60 cm soil layer 2 sl2 as compared with the field measured data are presented in figs 7 and 8 the statistical indicators for evaluation of model accuracy are provided in tables 2 and 4 the swc estimated by a model at planting acts as a starting point for computing soil water balance throughout the entire growing season the capability of hm2016 version of the model to estimate this soil water content based on simulation of water balance during fallow period is an advantage over the earlier hm2006 version the performance of the hybrid maize model in simulating the swc varied among different growing seasons for the same treatments inter annual variation and within the treatments for the same growing season as well statistically there were significant differences p 0 05 between field measured and model simulated swc in all years and treatments in both sl1 and sl2 except for the fit 75 fit and 60 fit in 2006 for sl1 that had p value greater than 0 05 while the highest nrmses between simulated and measured swc in sl1 were obtained for the rainfed treatments in almost all years the model performance in estimating swc was unsatisfactory for most of the treatments and years with negative ef values in both sl1 and sl2 table 4 for sl1 the goodness of fit indicators suggested very high error with absolute value of mpes in the range of 0 50 15 9 and nrmses ranging from 22 6 to as high as 62 4 the error range for sl2 was slightly smaller than sl1 but still very high with mpes ranging from 2 7 to 9 3 and nrmses in the range of 10 6 to 46 7 except for the rainfed treatment in 2006 the nrmses in all years and treatments for sl2 were less than 25 indicating underestimation of swc in all treatments overall there was a consistent trend of substantial underestimation of swc in both sl1 and sl2 in all cases the highest values of r2 in sl1 were observed in the 2009 growing season this general underestimation of swc might be caused by inaccurate simulation of evaporation and transpiration processes by the model the model seemed to simulate the trend of changes in swc along the growing seasons in most of the treatments this might be indicative of simulating higher runoff and deep percolation losses by the model which are affected by the soil properties generally the crop models tend to assume that the fields are uniform while there might exist some spatial variations in terms of soil physical chemical and biological properties that might influence the relationships between simulated and field measured data also the hybrid maize model allows specifying only top two soil layers assuming similar or same soil properties for the deeper layers which can differ in the fields and may introduce errors in simulation of swc therefore an additional option to input the actual field soil properties for more than two soil layers down to crop root zone e g 1 20 1 50 m in the model may allow more precise accurate simulation of soil moisture content to the best of authors knowledge there is no evidence of simulation of soil moisture by the model during initial calibration and or validation approaches yang et al 2004 2017 using carefully measured field data as the amount of soil moisture plays a critical role in determining crop yield and other important crop production processes it is essential to validate the model relative to water balance components contrary to the results in this research liu et al 2012 indicated that the simulated swc agreed well with the measured data for both irrigated and rainfed treatments with nrmses in the range of 11 20 however they observed overestimation of simulated swc with absolute mpes ranging from 0 5 to 3 7 these findings indicate that there is need for further evaluation of the model in terms of soil water components to establish the reasons for such bias and to determine the accuracy of model performance in this regard in the current research the statistics and performance analyses of simulated vs field measured soil moisture data indicate that current simulation accuracy of the hybrid maize model for swc are poor and can cause substantial problems challenges for accurately estimating soil water dynamics crop water uptake crop water use and other hydrologic balance components on a field scale further this poor performance by the model indicates that the model s ability for simulating estimating in season irrigation practices irrigation scheduling would also be very poor unacceptable 3 5 crop evapotranspiration accurate quantification crop evapotranspiration et is critical for development of effective irrigation management practices as well as determination of final grain yield and water availability and use analyses and projections the fit treatments represent standard conditions in which crop is grown under excellent agronomic and soil water conditions while the water stress treatments including 75 fit 60 fit 50 fit and rainfed represents non standard conditions the crop et under standard and non standard conditions is usually referred as etc and etcadj respectively however in this research a commonly used terminology of etc was adopted for both standard and non standard conditions all treatments for simplicity and for consistency with those reported in the literature for comparisons the treatment for which etc is being discussed is clearly mentioned in the text to avoid any confusion and where it does not mention a particular treatment it refers to the crop et of all treatments in general to evaluate the model accuracy in this regard etc simulated by hybrid maize model was compared with the field measured etc irmak 2015a b and the results are presented graphically for each year 2005 2010 in fig 9 and pooled data for irrigated and rainfed treatments in fig 10 and tabulated in tables 2 and 5 there were significant differences p 0 05 between field measured and hybrid maize simulated crop evapotranspiration in all years and treatments table 2 the hybrid maize model significantly underestimated etc in all treatments and years figs 9 and 10 the difference in simulated and field measured etc varied from 46 mm to as high as 167 mm corresponding to pe range of 7 7 28 despite the goodness of fit parameters for the model indicating that there was good correlation r2 0 82 in fig 10 for pooled data between the simulated and measured etc estimations had substantial errors nrmse 16 2 i e nrmse 30 the model efficiency was very low and in simulating etc with ef value of 1 20 the model estimates varied among years for the same treatments and between different treatments in the same year thus the simulated values had considerable inter annual variability which was also observed in the field measured data this inter annual variability in etc as well as differences in etc between the treatments in the same year is expected as etc is driven by numerous climate variables which also varied between the years and by irrigation management i e fit limited irrigation and rainfed except for 2006 growing season the highest prediction error in simulating etc was observed for rainfed treatments in all years and no other significant patterns were observed between simulated and measured etc the reason for underestimation of etc can be attributed to under prediction of swc by the model as discussed in the previous section again to the best of our knowledge no other studies have evaluated the model performance relative to soil water dynamics most of the studies available focused solely on the crop growth parameters such as lai and biomass and grain yield estimation of etc is a complex process that requires accurate simulation of soil moisture deep percolation runoff plant water uptake and other water losses occurring in the field the extreme simplification of the model might ignore intricate soil water plant atmosphere interactions and may result in errors in prediction of the soil water components which in turn results in high errors in predicting etc on the other side some errors might also result from the errors in the field measured data while quantifying etc using water balance method more robust estimates of etc can be obtained if evaporation and transpiration is directly measured in the field which in most cases is not feasible in the field experiments due to limitations in financial resources time labor and trained personnel independently measured soil evaporation and plant transpiration data from different sites and years would aid in establishing specific reasons for the bias between simulated and measured etc when compared to other models such as aquacrop the etc estimates using aquacrop model were reported to be more accurate than those simulated by the hybrid maize model for example for the same research site sandhu and irmak 2019 reported that the aquacrop model predicted etc with good accuracy as indicated by low nrmses of 3 2 and 8 7 during calibration and validation respectively this implies that the model algorithms in hybrid maize in terms of simulation of soil water dynamics and etc need substantial improvement to improve model s prediction accuracy so that it can be a useful tool in crop simulations although it was suggested by yang et al 2017 that numerous improvements were introduced in the latest hm2016 version of the model to accurately simulate soil water dynamics the results in this research indicate that the model needs further and substantial improvements these significant underestimation of etc estimates by the hybrid maize model can cause significant issues when this model is used for determining water resources assessments especially for water resources availability vs use analyses thus the model currently does not have enough accuracy to be used for water resources planning and management including irrigation management without additional and more robust improvements calibration and additional extensive validations using carefully measured field data 3 6 grain yield final grain yield is perhaps the most important variable in terms of farm net return which impacts the entire economics of farming operations final attainable yield can vary depending on the initial swc soil water holding capacity planting date and density crop evapotranspiration and precipitation during the growing season the yield fluctuation exists more prominently for rainfed or water limited treatments as compared with the irrigated maize yields figs 11 and 12 the hybrid maize model grain yield simulation results as compared with measured grain yields are presented for each year in fig 11 and pooled data for all years in irrigated and rainfed treatments in fig 12 the statistical analysis for the grain yield in all years and treatments is given in tables 2 and 6 grain yields simulated by the hybrid maize model in this research were within range of 0 15 of the measured grain yields across irrigated treatments including fit 75 fit 60 fit and 50 fit and years similar to etc simulated grain yields had inter annual variability between the years for the same treatments as well as for different treatments in a given year the largest discrepancies between measured and simulated grain yield were observed in the rainfed treatments in which the percent deviation was as high as 56 3 3 6 mg ha in 2006 which was the driest of all six years also the lowest percent deviation between measured and simulated rainfed yield was 13 7 1 9 mg ha in the wettest 2008 growing season table 6 overall the final grain yield across all years and treatments was simulated with moderate accuracy as indicated by r2 of 0 69 mpe of 0 43 nrmse of 14 and ef value of 0 57 the higher bias between simulated and measured yields cannot be considered acceptable for rainfed treatments the reason for the higher discrepancies in rainfed yields is due to inaccuracy of the model in simulating high water stress conditions although yang et al 2017 suggested that the improved hm2016 model predicted better rainfed yields than hm2006 version with r2 of 0 94 rmse of 1 2 mg ha and mpe of 0 5 mg ha the results of the current research did not identify sufficient evidence to indicate improved grain yield simulations using long term measured grain yield data yang et al 2004 reported that the hybrid maize model simulated grain yields were in the range of 0 12 of the measured yields under full irrigation conditions likewise liu et al 2012 reported pe in the range of 2 12 using earlier version of the hybrid maize model under both irrigated and rainfed yields for a semi arid environment in china they also indicated that the model tends to overpredict the rainfed yields contrary to this the results of the current research indicate that the model only overestimated rainfed yields in 2005 and 2006 drier years while it underestimated for the rest of the years this resulted due to earlier canopy closure predicted by the model under extreme water deficit conditions resulting in premature crop due to drought 4 summary and conclusions modeling maize growth and development grain yield and water use crop evapotranspiration in water limited environments as well as in non water limiting conditions has been a significant scientific and research challenge in this research a recently modified improved hybrid maize model performance was evaluated for its efficacy in simulating maize growth soil water balance and yield components using long term six years field measured data the new and revised version of hybrid maize model hm2016 was suggested to better simulate yields in harsh rainfed environments as compared with its earlier version as a tool to identify crop management options in most cases the model estimated and field measured variables were significantly different p 0 05 the lai simulated by the hybrid maize model was in agreement with the field measured values in the irrigated treatments with moderate estimates in the rainfed treatment in 2009 however the simulated lai was highly underpredicted during mid season and late growth stages in all treatments in 2010 and the model predicting severe drought stress in 50 fit and rainfed treatments resulting in accelerated canopy senescence thus the model estimates were inconsistent providing non repeatable estimates between the years this suggests the need for revision of leaf area expansion and senescence algorithms for robust estimates under water stress environments above ground biomass development was simulated with moderate accuracy during early growth stages in both years and in all treatments however in the late season biomass was overestimated in 2009 except in rainfed treatment and underestimated in 2010 with highest discrepancies occurring in rainfed treatment nrmse 30 therefore final aboveground biomass was highly over predicted in 2009 and highly under predicted in 2010 with high pe values of up to 31 in 2009 and 34 in 2010 the model performance relative to simulation of swc was highly unsatisfactory as the simulated swc was lower than the measured data in almost all treatments and years determination of model accuracy relative to soil water balance components is essential the validations regarding the simulation of soil water content and crop evapotranspiration are rare to that end the model was evaluated for soil water content in the root zone and the results indicated that the model estimates were unsatisfactory with regards to both first and second soil layers this bias was more pronounced in the rainfed treatment to improve the swc estimates introducing the option to specify soil properties for more than the top two soil layers is suggested allowing the user to input more readily available soil properties such as field capacity permanent wilting point and saturation point also evaluation of accuracy of other soil water balance components such as runoff and deep percolation is recommended owing to substantial underestimation of swc the crop et was also significantly underestimated by the model in all treatments and years the bias in simulation of etc was demonstrated by unacceptable ef value of 1 2 high mpe of 93 5 mm and nrmse of 16 2 the nrmse value for crop et was higher in rainfed treatment than irrigated treatments final grain yield was simulated with poor to moderate accuracy for the irrigated treatments by the model with prediction error of less than 15 and the prediction error was even much higher for rainfed conditions with pe value as high as 56 3 a 15 pe value is associated with a 2 mg ha grain yield difference in this research that was carried out in a high yielding environment between simulated and field measured data and this is an unacceptable high prediction error in low yielding environments this prediction error can be even a more serious issue indicating model s inability and unsuitability for applications in low crop yields regions therefore caution must be exercised while employing the hybrid maize model for its application based on the error range presented in this research overall the model improvements relative to soil water balance components and predictions under water stress environments is suggested based on the results of this research further evaluation of the model is also recommended especially for water balance components using carefully measured field data

10456,hybrid maize model was evaluated for its performance for simulating maize growth grain yield soil water content swc and crop evapotranspiration etc under full irrigation treatment fit limited irrigation 50 60 and 75 of fit and rainfed using long term 2005 2010 and field measured data in nebraska usa current version of the hybrid maize model was found to be unsatisfactory for estimating maize growth and water balance components or grain yield in most cases significant differences p 0 05 were observed between model estimated vs field measured variables leaf area index lai was simulated with modest accuracy for most of the irrigated treatments with a normalized root mean squared error nrmse 16 in 2009 and 30 in 2010 in which a trend of underestimation was observed the model simulated early season biomass well in 2010 but overpredicted in 2009 and underpredicted in 2010 during the late season the total seasonal biomass for both years was simulated with very high overall nrmse of 20 2 and mean prediction error mpe of 0 28 the swc estimates by the model were highly unsatisfactory in almost all treatments and years with negative ef values and high nrmses ranging from 47 to 62 this bias in swc prediction resulted in significant p 0 05 underestimation of seasonal etc by the model in all years and treatments the difference in simulated and field measured etc varied from 46 mm to as high as 167 mm corresponding to the prediction error pe range of 7 7 28 with pooled data nrmse of 16 2 these are very high etc estimation errors that can result in significant challenges if the model is used for predicting water supply demand and use analyses or in season irrigation management the final grain yield was simulated with moderate accuracy in some cases and poorly in other

nrmse of 14 and ef value of 0 57 overall model estimates were inconsistent for the same variables treatments between the years additional improvements in the model to add additional soil layers input capability may aid in more representative accurate estimates of swc the highest discrepancies between simulated and measured data were observed for rainfed treatments indicating unsuitability of the

maize is one of the most widely distributed and utilized crops in the world with global production of nearly 1100 million metric tons usda fas 2019 approximately one third of the world maize is produced in the unites states the midwestern united states accounts for the highest maize production with iowa illinois and nebraska being the top three maize producing states in 2018 increasing demands for food feed and fuel due to increasing global population would require even more substantial increases in food production while protecting natural resources and using input resources water nitrogen pesticides land etc as efficiently as possible thus increasing crop yield potential with limited resources is currently a significant challenge for the scientific community policy and decision makers planners as well as producers and other agricultural professionals light temperature nitrogen and availability of water are considered as the most crucial factors determining yield cirilo and andrade 1994 proper management of input resources particularly irrigation water is necessary to maximize yields as well as profits for farmers however the growing competition for limited water resources will continue reduce its availability for irrigation additionally increasing pumping costs low crop prices and inadequate irrigation system capacities prompt growers to reduce irrigation water use to improve crop productivity craciun and craciun 1995 especially in many of the water limiting regions adoption of appropriate crop production and water management strategies such as deficit or limited irrigation can be viable means to reduce irrigation water use while maintaining the yield potential pandey et al 2000 irmak 2015a b deficit irrigation allows moderate water stress at vegetative and maturity stages and ensures appropriate moisture during water sensitive growth stages of flowering and yield formation kang et al 2000 limited irrigation allows limited amount of water to be distributed equally or unequally in each irrigation which can result in reduction in terms of the impact of water stress on crop growth and development and yield and can also improve crop water productivity especially in regions in which irrigation is practiced as a supplementary source of water to precipitation irmak 2015a b the information related to such crop production practices have been traditionally obtained by using conventional approach based on agronomic and agricultural engineering research in which crop production functions are developed from statistical analysis the qualitative observations and quantitative information obtained from the field experiments have been used to understand the underlying principles for different crop processes and aid in agricultural decision making however in addition to time and financial constraints site specific field research may limit its results applicability to other sites with varying climatic soil and crop management conditions thus widely applicable agricultural research is required to provide information to growers and managers about sustainable agricultural practices over a wide range of climatic variations in this direction the use of crop models can be a viable strategy if models are properly calibrated and validated to produce relevant accurate and robust consistent and repeatable estimates crop growth simulation models are computer programs that integrate the current knowledge about plant growth and development processes from variety of disciplines including crop science agronomy physiology soil science agricultural engineering and agrometeorology to imitate the behavior of crop s growth development yield and other variables they are applied in crop management research teaching yield forecasts policy analysis and decision making but their use is primarily in academic setting and their applications in practical applications for decision making by growers has been limited the development of crop models dates back to 1960s starting with simple water balance models for the development of plant growth simulation models in the 1980s oteng darko et al 2013 the first attempt to model photosynthetic rates of crop canopies was made in the 1960s de wit 1965 followed by development of models based on linkages between photosynthesis and respiration de wit 1978 over time advances in understanding of plant physiological processes and their relations to plant growth functions radiation use efficiency stress and environmental inputs have led to construction of numerous crop models such as sucros van laar et al 1997 wofost boogaard et al 1998 ceres ritchie 1998 epic williams et al 1984 dssat jones et al 2003 and others the extensive overview of several crop modelling approaches is given by van ittersum et al 2003 the selection of a particular crop model depends on the purpose of application ease of use availability of required input data and information accuracy and robustness although there are several models available for maize including dssat jones et al 2003 intercom kropff and van laar 1993 stics brisson et al 2003 and most of the models require highly detailed input data hybrid specific information including genetic information complicated to use or lack comprehensive user support documentation to run the model therefore a simple but reliable crop simulation model is required for estimating maize yields evaluating management options and decision making with good accuracy however knowledge in terms of model s simplicity and its accuracy must be carefully investigated validated to provide information about their suitability or unsuitability for different conditions in this research the hybrid maize model yang et al 2004 is selected as it is simple user friendly fast and requires relatively fewer input parameters as compared with other crop models the simplicity of the model is considered as an advantage as not all input variables required by the model can be measured in the field experiments moreover the hybrid maize model is based on synthesis of two major types of crop modelling approaches combining crop specific attributes related to phenology and organ growth from ceres maize jones et al 1986 with explicit photosynthesis and respiration functions from assimilate driven generic crop models such as sucros wofost and intercom kropff and van laar 1993 van diepen et al 1989 van ittersum et al 2003 the model has been used in simulating maize yield at field scale grassini et al 2009 yang et al 2004 as well as regional scale liu et al 2015 to assess yield potential and yield gaps farmaha et al 2016 van ittersum et al 2016 yield forecasting morell et al 2016 evaluate crop management options chen et al 2011 meng et al 2013 nutrient management setiyono et al 2011 water productivity grassini et al 2009 and climate change impacts cassman et al 2010 however the performance of the model has not yet been evaluated sufficiently under varying amounts of water stress over the growing season using long term data from carefully conducted field research besides the validations have been performed under either rainfed or fully irrigated conditions in the available literature most importantly the model performance relative to soil water balance components including root zone soil water content and crop evapotranspiration is lacking which are the major factors influencing grain yield moreover the recent improvements in the hybrid maize model yang et al 2017 to improve its performance under water stress conditions also require comprehensive evaluation of the model including for the conditions in which it was calibrated for as the hybrid maize model was developed for the usa corn belt and has already been calibrated for the nebraska conditions the major guiding principle of this research was to evaluate the efficacy of the model in simulating maize parameters using the calibrated parameters coefficients and only altering the management specific variables the specific objectives of this research were to evaluate the performance of the hybrid maize model relative to i crop growth parameters such as leaf area index and aboveground biomass ii water use components including crop evapotranspiration and soil water and iii grain yield under full irrigation limited irrigation and rainfed conditions in a transition zone between sub humid and semi arid climatic conditions in nebraska usa 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiments description the field experiments that generated all the input data for model runs were conducted in the irmak research laboratory s advanced irrigation engineering plant physiology climate science and evapotranspiration research facilities at the university of nebraska s unl south central agricultural laboratory scal near cay center nebraska usa irmak 2015a b scal is located at 40 34 n and 98 8 w at an elevation of 552 m above mean sea level it is in a transition zone between sub humid and semi arid climatic zones with strong winds and hot and dry summers with high vapor pressure deficit especially during july and august the site receives approximately 730 mm of annual precipitation on long term average basis with significant inter annual and inter growing season variation in magnitude and timing irmak 2015a the soil at the site is a hastings silt loam which is a well drained upland soil fine montmorillonitic mesic udic argiustoll with a 0 5 north south slope direction having field capacity of 0 34 m3 m 3 permanent wilting point of 0 14 m3 m 3 and saturation point of 0 53 m3 m 3 the particle size distribution is 15 sand 65 silt and 20 clay with a 2 5 organic matter content in the topsoil the typical effective rooting depth of maize at the site is 1 20 1 50 m irmak 2015a b the field research data collection and detailed experimental procedures were outlined in irmak 2015a b and will not be repeated here briefly the experiments were conducted from 2005 to 2010 growing seasons and the field 16 5 ha was planted to maize with the same or hybrids with very similar genetic backgrounds every year with planting population of 73 000 plants ha with a planting depth of 0 05 m the experimental design was a completely randomized design with three replications and each replication plot was 1 ha in size there were four irrigation treatments including fully irrigated treatment fit limited irrigation treatments 75 fit 60 fit and 50 fit and rainfed control treatment the field was irrigated using a four span hydraulic and continuous move center pivot irrigation system t l irrigation hastings nebraska irrigation was triggered based on the soil water content of fit same treatments were enforced in all six years except for 2005 which was the first year when the center pivot system was purchased installed and operated therefore in 2005 only fit and rainfed treatments were implemented the entire field received uniform application of fertilizers and pesticides when needed irmak 2015a b the summary information on agronomic field management practices is provided table 1 irmak 2015a b 2 2 sampling and measurements the sampling area for each treatment plot in all replications was eight rows wide and 15 2 m long with a row spacing of 0 76 m plant height was measured on a weekly basis by selecting ten plants randomly from each replication and treatment throughout the growing season from crop emergence until physiological maturity plants were sampled in 1 m2 sections from each replication randomly to quantify the biomass production over time samples were taken every one or two weeks differed among growing seasons and dried at 70 c until they reached a constant weight and were weighed to quantify dry matter production leaf area index lai was measured on a weekly or ten day period using a leaf canopy analyzer model li cor 2000 licor biosciences lincoln neb several lai readings were recorded from each treatment plot and replication during the entire growing season daily treatment mean lai was calculated from all measurements for each treatment the replication data were used to calculate standard deviation for lai grain yield was determined by hand harvesting the center two rows over 15 2 m of each plot and was adjusted to 15 5 grain moisture content irmak 2015a b the volumetric soil water content swc was measured using a troxler model 4300 neutron probe troxler electronics laboratories research triangle park nc up to soil depth of 1 80 m at increments of 0 30 m on a weekly or biweekly basis in all treatments these swc measurements were used in irrigation management and soil water balance calculations the seasonal crop evapotranspiration was calculated using the following soil water balance equation 1 etc p i u r d δsws where etc is crop evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is irrigation water applied mm u is upward soil water flux mm assumed zero because the groundwater depth is approximately 33 m below the surface r is surface run off mm d is deep percolation from the crop root zone mm and δsws is change in soil water storage in the soil profile mm from the beginning to the end of the growing season the surface run off from each treatment was calculated using the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service curve number method united states department of agriculture soil conservation service usda nrcs 1985 deep percolation was calculated using a daily water balance computer program written in microsoft visual basic as mentioned in djaman and irmak 2012 using the data of swc below 1 50 m depth inputs to the program included weather variables of air temperature solar radiation relative humidity wind speed rainfall irrigation dates and amounts initial soil water at emergence and crop and site specific information such as planting date maturity date soil parameters and maximum crop rooting depth the plant measurements including lai plant height and biomass were taken during 2009 and 2010 growing seasons while phenological stage observations yield and swc measurements were performed in all six growing seasons 2005 2010 irmak 2015a b 2 3 hybrid maize model hybrid maize is a crop simulation model that describes maize growth and development relative to weather soil properties and management factors using set of mathematical formulations it simulates maize growth under non limiting as well as water limited conditions based on daily weather data it allows for the assessment of a given site s yield potential evaluation of yield changes due to different crop management practices in season and future crop growth and yield simulations and exploration of irrigation management options the model has mostly been evaluated in rainfed and irrigated maize systems yang et al 2004 the hybrid maize model combines the strengths of two modelling approaches incorporating the crop specific attributes such as phenology and plant organ growth from ceres maize jones et al 1986 kiniry et al 1997 and explicit photosynthesis and respiration functions from generic crop models like sucros wofost and intercom van diepen et al 1989 van ittersum et al 2003 the hybrid maize model also includes modifications for several functions obtained from model calibration procedures using field experiments data conducted under minimum possible stress conditions yang et al 2004 the model is more responsive to changes in environmental conditions than ceres maize due to inclusion of gross assimilation growth and maintenance respiration functions it requires fewer hybrid specific input parameters assuming without sacrificing the prediction accuracy for instance the model uses linear relationship between growing degree days gdd to anthesis and gdd to maturity for predicting anthesis as the information about gdd to maturity is readily available for most commercial hybrids the model has a windows based user interface with full text and graphical display climate data utility to import online weather data and allows exporting simulation results it can be used for single season or long term simulations using multi year climate data for a given site the detailed descriptions of major crop processes and model components is provided by yang et al 2004 in this research the latest version of the hybrid maize model i e hm2016 was used this version has been revised from earlier 2006 version hm2006 with regards to root distribution canopy expansion and senescence in response to crop water deficit kernel setting surface runoff soil evaporation and crop transpiration estimation of soil water content at sowing based on simulation of water balance during the fallow period and new batch run function to better simulate yields in harsh rainfed environments yang et al 2017 these improvements are suggested assumed to make the revised hybrid maize model more robust in simulating maize yields over a wide range of environments and field conditions 2 4 model parameters input data the performance of hybrid maize model was evaluated using datasets measured in five treatments fit 75 fit 60 fit 50 fit and rainfed that were imposed in six research years from 2005 to 2010 with diverse variations of weather parameters within a single season as well as among different growing seasons this provided an ideal opportunity to evaluate model s performance response to different crop and irrigation management strategies in different climatic conditions moreover the availability of a wide range of crop growth and water use parameters measured in the field allows for the comprehensive evaluation of the model 2 4 1 weather soil and other measured field data the weather data including minimum and maximum air temperature minimum and maximum relative humidity wind speed solar radiation reference evapotranspiration and precipitation for the analyses were obtained from the nearby weather station that is a part of the high plains regional climate center hprcc automated weather station network which was located only about 2 km from the experimental field the weather data for the 2005 2010 years were used in the model to run simulations for simulation of different variables a single year simulation mode was selected for each growing season to estimate aforementioned variables for each year separately the soil at the site is a hastings silt loam and the maximum rooting depth of 150 cm was set which is usually recommended for the soils without any physical or chemical constraints to root growth the soil textures for the topsoil and sub soil were specified to be silt loam and clay loam respectively based on the field observations irmak 2010 the model contains default soil properties for each of these textural classes that is used for simulation of soil water balance and conversion between soil water pressure and soil water content the bulk density of topsoil usually ranges from 1 1 to 1 40 g cm3 and a value of 1 30 g cm3 was specified based on the soil texture and structure of the field under consideration irmak 2010 the model allows the users to set the soil moisture status either for the time of planting or for the start of a fallow period in this research soil moisture status was set at planting owing to considerable snowfall events in the research region during the fallow period due to significant snowfall and rainfall events before the onset of growing season the initial soil moisture in the field during planting is usually considered to be at field capacity the soil moisture in the topsoil and subsoil was adjusted for each growing season based on the field observations that ranged from 75 wet to 100 very wet of crop available water the soil surface coverage by crop residues varied between each growing season and was set accordingly that ranged from minimum of 5 to maximum of 40 this option allows for the accurate estimation of soil evaporation and surface runoff in the model finally the surface run off was calculated by the model using two user specified inputs including average field slope and soil drainage class the selected field has a field slope of 2 with good soil drainage and these parameters were selected to calculate runoff in the model 2 4 2 crop growth and development parameters in hybrid maize model all the important input parameters are transparent and accessible to users these parameters should be modified only in certain circumstances such as for testing the sensitivity of the model to changes in key parameters for simulation of maize hybrids that differ significantly from the common commercial hybrids used in model development and validation and for the situations for which model has not been developed or validated the current research was conducted in same location i e nebraska and for a similar maize hybrid for which the model has been developed and validated thus the need for re calibration of parameters as opposed to those developed by yang et al 2004 would be unnecessary therefore in this research the conservative crop growth respiration and photosynthesis parameters developed by yang et al 2004 were retained and used in the validation reported here to further evaluate the performance and robustness of the model these parameters include general physiological coefficients used in functions to describe crop growth and development more information on deriving these parameters is given in yang et al 2004 2017 while hereafter some of the modified and user specific parameters are briefly described the default sowing depth was altered in the parameter settings from 4 cm to 5 cm based on the actual planting depth during the field experiments the hybrid specific parameters are the brand specific parameters that describe the computation of starting time for growing degree days gdd minimum and maximum of relative maturity ratings and the coefficients of linear regression of total gdd to gdd to silking and the coefficients of linear regression of gdd to silking to total gdd in this research only the information about days to relative maturity was available in such scenarios where gdd to silking data is not available the generic brand coefficients can be used to estimate the gdd to silking thus the regression functions for generic brand were selected for this research the crop management information related to date of planting and planting population density were obtained from the field experiments irmak 2015a b for each growing season and is given in table 1 irrigation amounts applied to each treatment in the field and dates were entered to specify the irrigation management finally for the analysis of all cropping seasons parameters simulation of growth in a single cropping season was selected as the simulation mode 2 5 data analyses to evaluate the model performance for simulating different field measured variables the field measured lai biomass grain yield soil water content and crop evapotranspiration were compared to the outputs simulated by the hybrid maize model the goodness of fit of the model was determined using a combination of statistical indicators including percent deviation pe normalized root mean squared error nrmse mean prediction error mpe nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ef and coefficient of determination r2 pe was used to assess percent deviation between measured and simulated variables relative to the measured values pe values approaching zero indicate better model performance and is calculated as 1 p e s i m i m i 100 where m i is the field measured observed value and s i represents simulated value pe was calculated for final above ground biomass crop evapotranspiration and grain yield brisson et al 2002 suggested that if pe values do not exceed 15 the simulation results can be considered acceptable for field crop research rmse is used to measure the magnitude of difference between simulated and observed values and ranges from 0 to positive infinity with 0 indicating good and infinity indicating poor model performance jacovides and kontoyiannis 1995 rmse is expressed in units of a given variable and it can be normalized using the mean of the measured variables and is known as normalized root mean squared error nrmse which is then expressed as a percentage 2 r m s e i 1 n s i m i 2 n 3 n r m s e r m s e m 100 where m is the mean of measured values the validation is considered excellent if nrmse is 10 good if it is between 10 and 20 acceptable if it is between 20 and 30 and poor for values 30 jamieson et al 1991 the ef measures the relative magnitude of the residual variance as compared with the variance of field measured variables indicating how well the measured vs simulated data fit the 1 1 line nash and sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2007 ef ranges from minus infinity to 1 where 1 indicates perfect match between the model estimates and the observations and is calculated by the following equation 4 e f 1 i 1 n s i m i 2 i 1 n m i m 2 mpe indicates mean bias in the total difference between simulated and measured values and is used to denote under prediction mpe 0 and over prediction mpe 0 5 m p e 1 n i 1 n m i s i the r2 and ef were used to quantify the predictive power of the model while nrmse mpe were used as the indicators of the model prediction error a paired two sample t test was also conducted for alpha value of 0 05 to test if there were significant differences between model simulated and field measured values for lai biomass etc grain yield and soil water content the null hypothesis was that there are no significant differences between simulated and measured variables mentioned above 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions the long term average growing season precipitation at the research site is 437 mm but the timing and magnitude of precipitation differ significantly across years and within the growing season the monthly growing season precipitation amounts for 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 growing seasons are presented in fig 1 the total growing season precipitation from planting until maturity amounts were 280 345 355 519 377 and 485 mm for 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 growing seasons respectively in general 2005 was the driest and 2008 was the wettest growing season among all six years resulting in highest and lowest irrigation water application respectively in these years the total irrigation amounts applied to full irrigation treatments in 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 were 280 241 132 51 178 and 127 mm respectively irrigation was usually initiated in late june to mid july that corresponded to the most water intensive stages of maize and was terminated around late august early to mid september the maximum mean temperature of 21 7 c from plating to silking was observed in 2006 growing season and the minimum of 18 1 c in 2009 growing season the maximum monthly average vapor pressure deficit vpd was observed in july 2005 followed by june 2006 2007 and 2008 and august 2009 and 2010 irmak 2015a these substantial differences in climatic variables between the growing seasons provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the model performance under dry normal and wet growing seasons 3 2 leaf area index the growth dynamics of maize including leaf area index lai and aboveground biomass were evaluated using the model and compared against the field measured data collected in 2009 and 2010 growing seasons the leaf area expansion and leaf senescence processes in hybrid maize model are similar to ceres maize model such that they are solely driven by air temperature until silking with adjustment of specific leaf area limited to 400 cm2 g 1 however in hybrid maize model leaf senescence is modified such that two phases of leaf senescence first phase from start of silking to beginning of effective grain filling and second phase from grain filling to physiological maturity in ceres maize were combined into one function for the whole growth period from grain filling to physiological maturity the graphical comparisons and goodness of fit parameters between the model simulated and field measured lai from emergence to physiological maturity are presented in fig 2 for 2009 and fig 3 for 2010 the hybrid maize model simulated lai with moderate to good accuracy for most of the irrigated treatments and the simulated values were in stronger agreement with the field measured values in 2009 growing season than in 2010 growing season the nrmses ranged from 12 5 to 26 4 in 2009 and from 22 6 to 38 9 in 2010 similarly lower mpe and higher ef values were obtained in 2009 as compared with 2010 with mpe ranging from 0 14 for fit to 0 35 for rainfed treatment in 2009 and from 0 84 for fit to 1 16 for rainfed treatment in 2010 and ef values ranged from 0 61 for fit to 0 88 for rainfed in 2009 and from 0 35 for fit to 0 51 for rainfed treatment in 2010 these statistical parameters indicate that the model performance declined with increase in water stress from fit to rainfed treatment also the model simulated accelerated senescence in rainfed treatment in 2009 and predicted that the crop prematurely senesced due to frost similarly the model predicted premature crop due to drought in 50 fit and rainfed treatment in 2010 resulting in early senescence however these situations did not have a pronounced impact on crop in the field as depicted by the field measured lai large discrepancies between measured and simulated lai during mid season were observed overall a trend of underestimation of lai was observed in 2010 especially after 72 days after planting dap that was close to the start of silking stage 81 dap as compared to 2009 lesser rainfall was received in 2010 during the maize reproductive growth stages indicating more stress in the 50 fit and rainfed treatments resulting in simulation of premature crop conditions by the model due to simulated drought but the impact of these dry periods was not indicated decline in field measured lai data statistical analysis table 2 indicated that there were no significant differences p 0 05 between field measured and model simulated values of lai in both 2009 and 2010 growing seasons except for the 50 fit treatment with p 0 05 in 2009 the results obtained in this research are comparable to those reported hybrid maize model simulated lai in the literature yang et al 2004 reported that hybrid maize simulated lai with ef values in range of 0 88 to 0 93 and mpe varied from 0 22 to 0 56 during growing seasons of 1999 to 2002 under optimum water and nutrient supply conditions but under different maize planting densities they also established that the model tends to underpredict lai during mid season when simulating lai under water deficit conditions yang et al 2017 indicated that the model simulated faster leaf area senescence during the last phase of grain filling in another study by liu et al 2012 the lai was reported to be simulated fairly well with nrmses in the range of 11 08 22 06 and mpes varying from 0 29 to 0 15 under both irrigated and rainfed conditions for two growing seasons hou et al 2014 evaluated the hybrid maize model after incorporating a module of plastic film mulching and reported nrmse of 20 for simulation of lai therefore our simulation results closely match with these reports except for the high discrepancies under extreme water stress conditions such as rainfed treatment in 2010 in which the model simulated lai showed large deviation from the field measured data with very high nrmse of 38 9 3 3 biomass production temperature is one of the major factors that drives leaf area development expansion which in turn drives the leaf biomass growth the comparative evaluations were made between measured and simulated development of above ground biomass from emergence to maturity for 2009 and 2010 growing seasons under all irrigation and rainfed treatments figs 4 and 5 the statistical indicators displaying the model efficacy in simulating the aboveground biomass are also presented on the figures as well the estimates of total end of the season above ground biomass are presented in fig 6 and the statistical indicators are presented in tables 2 and 3 the seasonal pattern of aboveground biomass production was simulated well by the hybrid maize model during early growth stages in both years and all treatments however the model differed in its prediction of biomass in late season such that the biomass development was simulated greater than the measured values in 2009 growing season in all treatments except for rainfed treatment in which the greatest disagreement between simulated and measured biomass nrmse 53 7 p 0 05 was observed except for the rainfed treatment in 2009 the model simulated values of biomass development over growing seasons were statistically similar to the field measured data p 0 05 the highest model ef of 0 95 and the lowest nrmse of 12 5 was obtained for fit except for the rainfed treatments this resulted in higher field measured final aboveground biomass table 2 than that predicted by the model as indicated by overall high mpe value of 0 28 mg ha table 3 this might be due to overestimation of lai during later crop growth stages i e from 115 dap to 140 dap in general the biomass development simulation in 2009 can be considered acceptable for irrigated treatments nrmses 20 ef 0 88 but not for the rainfed treatment ef 0 02 in 2010 the hybrid maize closely predicted the biomass accumulation over the growing season for fit 75 fit and 60 fit with high ef value of 0 99 mpe values less than 0 13 mg ha and nrmses less than 11 similar to 2009 growing season results the model was capable of predicting early season biomass development but differed from the field measured values during late season in 50 fit and rainfed treatment in which it was underestimated this results from early canopy closure predicted by the model resulting in premature crop due to drought stress the highest deviation between simulated and measured biomass development ef 0 86 mpe 1 2 mg ha and nrmse 31 8 as well as final aboveground biomass pe 33 9 was observed for the rainfed treatment essentially the final aboveground biomass was highly over predicted in 2009 and highly under predicted in 2010 with high pe values of up to 31 in 2009 and 34 in 2010 besides t test analysis indicated that final above ground biomass was significantly different p 0 05 from the model simulated biomass table 2 maize is more sensitive to water stress during silking and grain filling periods than other growth stages and the high bias in the model performance during these stages can give highly inaccurate estimates of grain yield as well as crop evapotranspiration results reported in the literature indicate similar findings as observed in this research yang et al 2004 observed the trend of biomass simulation as a part of the model validation study and reported that the hybrid maize closely predicted the aboveground biomass with ef 0 97 and absolute value of mpe in the range of 0 09 0 50 mg ha under optimal conditions in lincoln nebraska and manchester iowa these values are similar to those obtained in this current research except for the rainfed treatments that had higher bias and lower prediction accuracy in an attempt to improve model simulations under harsh rainfed environments modifications were introduced in the 2006 version of the model and the improved 2016 version hm2016 of the model was reported to be better in predicting seasonal dynamics of biomass production yang et al 2017 however in the current research the model estimates of aboveground biomass using hm2016 version under rainfed conditions did not improve and had the highest bias as compared with irrigated treatments contrarily liu et al 2012 reported good agreement between simulated and measured biomass under both irrigated and rainfed conditions with nrmses less than 22 however they obtained negative mpes as high as 2 6 mg ha in all treatments indicating significant overestimation of aboveground biomass by the model and suggested that this might occur because of unavoidable competition with weeds and damage by insects and pests in the field while overall the model estimates of aboveground biomass development can be considered as satisfactory for irrigated treatments the model estimates were poor for the rainfed conditions which suggest the need for further improvements in the model for accurately simulating biomass production which is critical for physiological phenological and other crop production vs environmental interactions analyses in this research no consistent trend in over or under estimation of total aboveground biomass was observed table 3 3 4 soil water content while soil moisture plays a vital role in crop production and many other related processes robust evaluation of model accuracy in predicting swc remains challenging in crop modeling efforts due to lack of good quality and sufficient field measured datasets accurate simulation of soil water content in the root zone is also critically important modelling soil water balance dynamics has always been a major challenge in water stressed as well as non water stressed environments in this research the hybrid maize model was evaluated for its ability to simulate swc in the crop root zone of 1 5 m for six individual growing seasons from 2005 to 2010 selected results relative to simulation of swc in the top two soil layers of 0 30 cm soil layer 1 sl1 and 30 60 cm soil layer 2 sl2 as compared with the field measured data are presented in figs 7 and 8 the statistical indicators for evaluation of model accuracy are provided in tables 2 and 4 the swc estimated by a model at planting acts as a starting point for computing soil water balance throughout the entire growing season the capability of hm2016 version of the model to estimate this soil water content based on simulation of water balance during fallow period is an advantage over the earlier hm2006 version the performance of the hybrid maize model in simulating the swc varied among different growing seasons for the same treatments inter annual variation and within the treatments for the same growing season as well statistically there were significant differences p 0 05 between field measured and model simulated swc in all years and treatments in both sl1 and sl2 except for the fit 75 fit and 60 fit in 2006 for sl1 that had p value greater than 0 05 while the highest nrmses between simulated and measured swc in sl1 were obtained for the rainfed treatments in almost all years the model performance in estimating swc was unsatisfactory for most of the treatments and years with negative ef values in both sl1 and sl2 table 4 for sl1 the goodness of fit indicators suggested very high error with absolute value of mpes in the range of 0 50 15 9 and nrmses ranging from 22 6 to as high as 62 4 the error range for sl2 was slightly smaller than sl1 but still very high with mpes ranging from 2 7 to 9 3 and nrmses in the range of 10 6 to 46 7 except for the rainfed treatment in 2006 the nrmses in all years and treatments for sl2 were less than 25 indicating underestimation of swc in all treatments overall there was a consistent trend of substantial underestimation of swc in both sl1 and sl2 in all cases the highest values of r2 in sl1 were observed in the 2009 growing season this general underestimation of swc might be caused by inaccurate simulation of evaporation and transpiration processes by the model the model seemed to simulate the trend of changes in swc along the growing seasons in most of the treatments this might be indicative of simulating higher runoff and deep percolation losses by the model which are affected by the soil properties generally the crop models tend to assume that the fields are uniform while there might exist some spatial variations in terms of soil physical chemical and biological properties that might influence the relationships between simulated and field measured data also the hybrid maize model allows specifying only top two soil layers assuming similar or same soil properties for the deeper layers which can differ in the fields and may introduce errors in simulation of swc therefore an additional option to input the actual field soil properties for more than two soil layers down to crop root zone e g 1 20 1 50 m in the model may allow more precise accurate simulation of soil moisture content to the best of authors knowledge there is no evidence of simulation of soil moisture by the model during initial calibration and or validation approaches yang et al 2004 2017 using carefully measured field data as the amount of soil moisture plays a critical role in determining crop yield and other important crop production processes it is essential to validate the model relative to water balance components contrary to the results in this research liu et al 2012 indicated that the simulated swc agreed well with the measured data for both irrigated and rainfed treatments with nrmses in the range of 11 20 however they observed overestimation of simulated swc with absolute mpes ranging from 0 5 to 3 7 these findings indicate that there is need for further evaluation of the model in terms of soil water components to establish the reasons for such bias and to determine the accuracy of model performance in this regard in the current research the statistics and performance analyses of simulated vs field measured soil moisture data indicate that current simulation accuracy of the hybrid maize model for swc are poor and can cause substantial problems challenges for accurately estimating soil water dynamics crop water uptake crop water use and other hydrologic balance components on a field scale further this poor performance by the model indicates that the model s ability for simulating estimating in season irrigation practices irrigation scheduling would also be very poor unacceptable 3 5 crop evapotranspiration accurate quantification crop evapotranspiration et is critical for development of effective irrigation management practices as well as determination of final grain yield and water availability and use analyses and projections the fit treatments represent standard conditions in which crop is grown under excellent agronomic and soil water conditions while the water stress treatments including 75 fit 60 fit 50 fit and rainfed represents non standard conditions the crop et under standard and non standard conditions is usually referred as etc and etcadj respectively however in this research a commonly used terminology of etc was adopted for both standard and non standard conditions all treatments for simplicity and for consistency with those reported in the literature for comparisons the treatment for which etc is being discussed is clearly mentioned in the text to avoid any confusion and where it does not mention a particular treatment it refers to the crop et of all treatments in general to evaluate the model accuracy in this regard etc simulated by hybrid maize model was compared with the field measured etc irmak 2015a b and the results are presented graphically for each year 2005 2010 in fig 9 and pooled data for irrigated and rainfed treatments in fig 10 and tabulated in tables 2 and 5 there were significant differences p 0 05 between field measured and hybrid maize simulated crop evapotranspiration in all years and treatments table 2 the hybrid maize model significantly underestimated etc in all treatments and years figs 9 and 10 the difference in simulated and field measured etc varied from 46 mm to as high as 167 mm corresponding to pe range of 7 7 28 despite the goodness of fit parameters for the model indicating that there was good correlation r2 0 82 in fig 10 for pooled data between the simulated and measured etc estimations had substantial errors nrmse 16 2 i e nrmse 30 the model efficiency was very low and in simulating etc with ef value of 1 20 the model estimates varied among years for the same treatments and between different treatments in the same year thus the simulated values had considerable inter annual variability which was also observed in the field measured data this inter annual variability in etc as well as differences in etc between the treatments in the same year is expected as etc is driven by numerous climate variables which also varied between the years and by irrigation management i e fit limited irrigation and rainfed except for 2006 growing season the highest prediction error in simulating etc was observed for rainfed treatments in all years and no other significant patterns were observed between simulated and measured etc the reason for underestimation of etc can be attributed to under prediction of swc by the model as discussed in the previous section again to the best of our knowledge no other studies have evaluated the model performance relative to soil water dynamics most of the studies available focused solely on the crop growth parameters such as lai and biomass and grain yield estimation of etc is a complex process that requires accurate simulation of soil moisture deep percolation runoff plant water uptake and other water losses occurring in the field the extreme simplification of the model might ignore intricate soil water plant atmosphere interactions and may result in errors in prediction of the soil water components which in turn results in high errors in predicting etc on the other side some errors might also result from the errors in the field measured data while quantifying etc using water balance method more robust estimates of etc can be obtained if evaporation and transpiration is directly measured in the field which in most cases is not feasible in the field experiments due to limitations in financial resources time labor and trained personnel independently measured soil evaporation and plant transpiration data from different sites and years would aid in establishing specific reasons for the bias between simulated and measured etc when compared to other models such as aquacrop the etc estimates using aquacrop model were reported to be more accurate than those simulated by the hybrid maize model for example for the same research site sandhu and irmak 2019 reported that the aquacrop model predicted etc with good accuracy as indicated by low nrmses of 3 2 and 8 7 during calibration and validation respectively this implies that the model algorithms in hybrid maize in terms of simulation of soil water dynamics and etc need substantial improvement to improve model s prediction accuracy so that it can be a useful tool in crop simulations although it was suggested by yang et al 2017 that numerous improvements were introduced in the latest hm2016 version of the model to accurately simulate soil water dynamics the results in this research indicate that the model needs further and substantial improvements these significant underestimation of etc estimates by the hybrid maize model can cause significant issues when this model is used for determining water resources assessments especially for water resources availability vs use analyses thus the model currently does not have enough accuracy to be used for water resources planning and management including irrigation management without additional and more robust improvements calibration and additional extensive validations using carefully measured field data 3 6 grain yield final grain yield is perhaps the most important variable in terms of farm net return which impacts the entire economics of farming operations final attainable yield can vary depending on the initial swc soil water holding capacity planting date and density crop evapotranspiration and precipitation during the growing season the yield fluctuation exists more prominently for rainfed or water limited treatments as compared with the irrigated maize yields figs 11 and 12 the hybrid maize model grain yield simulation results as compared with measured grain yields are presented for each year in fig 11 and pooled data for all years in irrigated and rainfed treatments in fig 12 the statistical analysis for the grain yield in all years and treatments is given in tables 2 and 6 grain yields simulated by the hybrid maize model in this research were within range of 0 15 of the measured grain yields across irrigated treatments including fit 75 fit 60 fit and 50 fit and years similar to etc simulated grain yields had inter annual variability between the years for the same treatments as well as for different treatments in a given year the largest discrepancies between measured and simulated grain yield were observed in the rainfed treatments in which the percent deviation was as high as 56 3 3 6 mg ha in 2006 which was the driest of all six years also the lowest percent deviation between measured and simulated rainfed yield was 13 7 1 9 mg ha in the wettest 2008 growing season table 6 overall the final grain yield across all years and treatments was simulated with moderate accuracy as indicated by r2 of 0 69 mpe of 0 43 nrmse of 14 and ef value of 0 57 the higher bias between simulated and measured yields cannot be considered acceptable for rainfed treatments the reason for the higher discrepancies in rainfed yields is due to inaccuracy of the model in simulating high water stress conditions although yang et al 2017 suggested that the improved hm2016 model predicted better rainfed yields than hm2006 version with r2 of 0 94 rmse of 1 2 mg ha and mpe of 0 5 mg ha the results of the current research did not identify sufficient evidence to indicate improved grain yield simulations using long term measured grain yield data yang et al 2004 reported that the hybrid maize model simulated grain yields were in the range of 0 12 of the measured yields under full irrigation conditions likewise liu et al 2012 reported pe in the range of 2 12 using earlier version of the hybrid maize model under both irrigated and rainfed yields for a semi arid environment in china they also indicated that the model tends to overpredict the rainfed yields contrary to this the results of the current research indicate that the model only overestimated rainfed yields in 2005 and 2006 drier years while it underestimated for the rest of the years this resulted due to earlier canopy closure predicted by the model under extreme water deficit conditions resulting in premature crop due to drought 4 summary and conclusions modeling maize growth and development grain yield and water use crop evapotranspiration in water limited environments as well as in non water limiting conditions has been a significant scientific and research challenge in this research a recently modified improved hybrid maize model performance was evaluated for its efficacy in simulating maize growth soil water balance and yield components using long term six years field measured data the new and revised version of hybrid maize model hm2016 was suggested to better simulate yields in harsh rainfed environments as compared with its earlier version as a tool to identify crop management options in most cases the model estimated and field measured variables were significantly different p 0 05 the lai simulated by the hybrid maize model was in agreement with the field measured values in the irrigated treatments with moderate estimates in the rainfed treatment in 2009 however the simulated lai was highly underpredicted during mid season and late growth stages in all treatments in 2010 and the model predicting severe drought stress in 50 fit and rainfed treatments resulting in accelerated canopy senescence thus the model estimates were inconsistent providing non repeatable estimates between the years this suggests the need for revision of leaf area expansion and senescence algorithms for robust estimates under water stress environments above ground biomass development was simulated with moderate accuracy during early growth stages in both years and in all treatments however in the late season biomass was overestimated in 2009 except in rainfed treatment and underestimated in 2010 with highest discrepancies occurring in rainfed treatment nrmse 30 therefore final aboveground biomass was highly over predicted in 2009 and highly under predicted in 2010 with high pe values of up to 31 in 2009 and 34 in 2010 the model performance relative to simulation of swc was highly unsatisfactory as the simulated swc was lower than the measured data in almost all treatments and years determination of model accuracy relative to soil water balance components is essential the validations regarding the simulation of soil water content and crop evapotranspiration are rare to that end the model was evaluated for soil water content in the root zone and the results indicated that the model estimates were unsatisfactory with regards to both first and second soil layers this bias was more pronounced in the rainfed treatment to improve the swc estimates introducing the option to specify soil properties for more than the top two soil layers is suggested allowing the user to input more readily available soil properties such as field capacity permanent wilting point and saturation point also evaluation of accuracy of other soil water balance components such as runoff and deep percolation is recommended owing to substantial underestimation of swc the crop et was also significantly underestimated by the model in all treatments and years the bias in simulation of etc was demonstrated by unacceptable ef value of 1 2 high mpe of 93 5 mm and nrmse of 16 2 the nrmse value for crop et was higher in rainfed treatment than irrigated treatments final grain yield was simulated with poor to moderate accuracy for the irrigated treatments by the model with prediction error of less than 15 and the prediction error was even much higher for rainfed conditions with pe value as high as 56 3 a 15 pe value is associated with a 2 mg ha grain yield difference in this research that was carried out in a high yielding environment between simulated and field measured data and this is an unacceptable high prediction error in low yielding environments this prediction error can be even a more serious issue indicating model s inability and unsuitability for applications in low crop yields regions therefore caution must be exercised while employing the hybrid maize model for its application based on the error range presented in this research overall the model improvements relative to soil water balance components and predictions under water stress environments is suggested based on the results of this research further evaluation of the model is also recommended especially for water balance components using carefully measured field data

10457,in the eastern gangetic plain of south asia cropping systems under conventional crop management are frequently unprofitable due to the inefficient use of resources particularly irrigation water and energy across the eastern gangetic plain farmers generally produce a wet season rice crop followed by an irrigated dry season crop maize has been recently introduced as the dry season crop and is rapidly growing in popularity irrigation water is commonly applied using diesel powered pumps and fluctuating fuel prices are a major factor affecting cropping system profitability we hypothesised that the adoption of zero tillage crop establishment in a rice maize system would reduce irrigation requirements compared to a conventionally established rice maize system while maintaining comparable crop yields thus higher water use efficiency and economic profitability would be achieved under the improved crop management compared to conventional practice field experiments over two years in sabour bihar demonstrated that early sowing of maize resulted in 8 higher maize grain yields while zero tillage establishment produced 7 higher maize grain yields than conventionally established maize using the apsim cropping systems model we tested our hypothesis over 49 years from 1969 to 2018 over the longer term zero till maize grain yields were 9 higher than those of conventionally established crops under these improved management practices fuel savings of 8 15 and labor savings of 34 43 were achieved compared to conventionally managed crops leading to higher water use efficiency in all treatments under improved management overall gross margins in rice maize systems under improved management practices were 20 39 higher than rice maize systems under conventional management in rice maize cropping systems in the eastern gangetic plain improved crop management practices can improve the efficiency of water use and thus increase farming households profitability and incomes keywords agronomic water management apsim eastern gangetic plain zero tillage simulation modelling water use efficiency 1 introduction the eastern gangetic plain encompasses large parts of the indian states of uttar pradesh bihar west bengal and assam as well as the terai plains of nepal and most of bangladesh ericksen et al 2011 islam et al 2019 gathala et al 2020a b this region is home to over 450 million people who live in some of the world s poorest agricultural communities ericksen et al 2011 yield gaps have been observed across the eastern gangetic plain in major crops including in rice wheat and maize these gaps are highest in the north west region which includes bihar where farmers are severely resource constrained and have little opportunity to acquire knowledge of improved crop management techniques or how to implement these gathala et al 2020a b islam et al 2019 lopez ridaura et al 2018 carter and darbas 2014 the eastern gangetic plain is characterised by substantial under utilized

south asian food security islam et al 2019 gathala et al 2018 ifpri 2016 the eastern gangetic plain is dominated by rice based cropping with rice rice 6 51 m ha rice wheat 6 22 m ha and rice maize 1 0

annually a predominantly rainfed wet season june october rice crop followed by an irrigated dry season november april wheat crop islam et al 2019 recently maize has emerged as a more attractive option for the dry season crop than wheat as it is a more productive crop with greater tolerance for high temperatures maize plants are less affected by terminal heat stress than wheat and so the rice maize system is more water efficient productive and profitable than the rice wheat jat et al 2019 islam et al 2019 gathala et al 2020a b pandey et al 2019 the rice maize cropping system is now the second most common cropping system in the eastern gangetic plain jat et al 2018 in cereal based cropping in the egp including the area around bihar conventional management results in high production costs due to low use efficiency of resources humphreys et al 2010 saharawat et al 2010 jat et al 2014 efficient crop production is challenging in the eastern gangetic plain due to smaller field sizes land fragmentation and limited awareness of improved crop management practices it is necessary to evaluate technologies which have the potential to improve the efficiency of cropping system inputs such as water while maintaining or increasing crop yields jat et al 2014 moreover low crop yields in the eastern gangetic plain are aggravated by water stress due to limited access to irrigation water resulting from poor infrastructure and or the high cost of pumping water krupnik et al 2017 ifpri 2016 in order to maximise economic returns all cropping systems including rice maize systems must be well managed including the optimal application of inputs such as irrigation water traditional crop management practices used in any cropping system in the drier regions of the eastern gangetic plain including bihar rely heavily on diesel powered machinery both for pre sowing land preparation and to pump irrigation water the production of dry season crops relies completely on water available to the crop and is therefore driven by irrigation practice increasing use of irrigation puts stress on the groundwater system and requires ever increasing consumption of diesel to extract water from lower depths sugden et al 2014 irrigated crop production costs are strongly affected by diesel prices which are highly variable krupnik et al 2017 brown et al 2017 gathala et al 2016 apart from pumping costs farmers do not have to pay to extract water for agricultural irrigation moreover a delayed sowing of maize following a late harvested and or a longer duration wet season rice crop extends the maize grain filling and maturity window into the hot and dry may june period increasing the amount of irrigation required to fulfil crop evaporative demands and ensure grain filling these high production costs reduce farm profitability gathala et al 2016 brown et al 2017 improved crop management practices such as zero tillage zt crop establishment have been shown to improve cropping

profitability enabling them to produce a comparably sized grain yield for less water this has the potential to reduce groundwater extraction and increase farmers gross margins the potential benefits of reduced or no tillage in south asia have been demonstrated to include 79 95 reductions in tillage and crop establishment costs gathala et al 2011 50 70 fuel savings hossen et al 2018 islam et al 2013 and up to 22 savings in total water use with improved yields under zero tillage providing additional economic income to farmers compared to conventional rice maize systems jat et al 2019 maize is a relatively new cash crop in the drier regions of the eastern gangetic plain and while farmers recognise the benefit of concentrating their resources to maximise maize production there have been few studies to date on rice maize cropping systems in the region and none to examine strategies to best use irrigation water to maximise maize productivity while minimizing farmers exposure to high and variable diesel prices we have observed farmers transitioning from rice wheat to rice maize cropping systems under traditional management and in this research we seek to help farmers improve their cropping system efficiency by identifying options to improve crop management practices e g by replacing conventional tillage ct with zero tillage zt and by improving their irrigation water strategies both of which will reduce the diesel required to produce a maize crop in this paper we use the results from a two year rice maize irrigation experiment conducted over four cropping seasons between 2016 and 2018 in bihar india to parameterize and calibrate the cropping system model apsim agriculture production system simulator holzworth et al 2014 for rice maize production on a clay loam over sandy loam soil in a humid sub tropical climate we then used apsim to identify optimal irrigation management practices and to examine over the longer term the effects of irrigation and crop management practices on irrigation water use and cropping system productivity and profitability our research focuses on the use of irrigation water to produce dry season maize under traditional ct and improved zt management practices the results observed here for an experimental site in bihar are applicable throughout other lower rainfall regions of the eastern gangetic plain with similar agro ecologies to the study site e g the nepali terai and parts of the indian states of uttar pradesh and bihar and may have broader applications in other tropical to subtropical semiarid cropping systems where subsistence farmers require options for efficient agronomic water management to maximise their cropping system productivity and profitability 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was carried out in the north central eastern gangetic plain at the research farm of bihar agricultural university bau 87 2 42 e 25 15 40 n 37 m above mean sea level sabour in bihar india between 2016 and 2018 the climate of the area is tropical to subtropical with a relatively low average annual rainfall of 1250 mm most of which falls from the middle of june to the middle of october daily maximum temperatures are highest up to 45 oc between may and june and the minimum temperature is lowest around 3 oc in early january the soil of the experimental site is classified as clay loam 0 300 mm in the upper layer and sandy loam 300 1200 mm at lower soil depths table 2 groundwater depth is variable between five and ten metres in the pre and post monsoon seasons government of india 2016 existing irrigation infrastructure was used during the experiment 2 2 experimental treatments we examined the performance of rice maize systems across two different establishment methods three different irrigation treatments in maize and with two rice varieties of different growing season lengths the experiment was laid out in a factorial plot design with three replications each replication was divided into two halves representing two varieties for rice and two sowing times for maize each rice variety was sub divided into five levels comprising of four rainfall based irrigation treatments in zero till zt direct seeded rice and one puddled transplanted conventional till ct rice with conventional management practice the first experimental factor was rice varieties whose different growing season durations short or medium created different sowing windows for the maize variety the second experimental factor was tillage system zt rice was sown with retained residues from the previous crop winter maize was grown in the plot prior to the commencement of the experiment and followed by zero till zt maize while ct rice was followed by ct maize the third experimental factor was irrigation with two four or six irrigations applied in maize there were 30 experimental plots of 2m 5m the treatment factors are summarized in table 1 and described in more detail below two hybrid rice varieties were sown nk 5251 120 125 days duration and arize 6444 130 135 days duration the maize variety p 3396 160 165 days duration was sown within seven days of harvesting rice in the eastern gangetic plain farmers grow a variety of rice cultivars leading to a wide window in which rice harvesting and maize sowing occurs the three crop varieties grown in this experiment were all widely available in the eastern gangetic plain and representative of those grown in farmers fields around bau in the conventionally tilled ct system puddled transplanted rice seedlings were manually transplanted into soil which had received five pre establishment land preparation operations e g ploughing levelling etc in ct maize fields were similarly ploughed five times before maize seeds were manually sown in rows both ct crops were harvested at ground level leaving no surface residue on the soil this reflects farmer practice where crop residues are commonly either removed to use as animal feeds or fuel for cooking or burned in situ in contrast in the zero till zt cropping systems rice and maize were both mechanically directly seeded within the retained anchored residue of the previous crop with no pre establishment land preparation in zt treatments approximately 100 150 mm 1 6 2 1 t ha 1 and 200 250 mm 2 1 2 6 t ha 1 of rice and maize stubble respectively were retained in the field after each crop in all ct and zt treatments weeds pests and diseases were controlled chemically following best practice guidelines sohane 2019 spot weeding was performed manually if required we did not observe a difference in pest or disease presence between ct and zt treatments nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were applied at rates of 120 60 and 40 kg ha 1 respectively in rice and 150 75 and 50 kg ha 1 respectively in maize as urea diammonium phosphate dap and muriate of potash respectively in ct and zt rice nitrogen was applied in three equal splits while the phosphorus and potassium were applied at crop establishment the first nitrogen split was applied at sowing for zt rice or at transplanting for ct rice the second at maximum tillering and the third at panicle initiation in maize one third of nitrogen and the entire doses of phosphorus and potassium were applied at sowing the remaining nitrogen was applied in two equal splits at v6 v8 appearance of 6 8 leaves and at v10 v12 appearance of 10 12 leaves ct rice was predominantly rainfed with supplementary irrigation being used if needed to ensure timely crop establishment and growth supplementary irrigation was applied to a depth of 50 mm for the first 20 days after transplanting if there was no standing water subsequently supplementary irrigation was applied if hairline cracks appeared approximately five to seven days after standing water had disappeared this irrigation strategy reflects recommended best practice sohane 2019 in zt rice there were four different irrigation treatments which varied depending on the amount of rainfall received within a predetermined period of time plots were irrigated to a depth of 50 mm when less than either 30 mm or 60 mm of cumulative rainfall had been received within the preceding five or ten days in the dry season maize crop there were three irrigation treatments for both establishment methods 60 mm of water was applied at each treatment at different phenological stages for the i2 treatment irrigation was applied twice at six leaf stage v6 and before silking for i4 it was applied four times at four leaf stage v4 10 leaf stage v10 before silking and before milking and for i6 irrigation was applied six times at v4 8 leaf stage v8 at booting before silking before milking and at the dough stage the i6 treatment represents common farmer practice in the eastern gangetic plain region around bihar irrigation water was applied using 150 mm diameter polyvinyl chloride pipes and the amount of water applied in each plot was calculated based on the discharge rate from the pipe and the duration for which water was applied in each plot the discharge rate was measured before each irrigation to ensure the predetermined amount of water was consistently applied in each plot 2 3 climate and soil data daily meteorological data maximum and minimum temperature precipitation and solar radiation were obtained from the meteorological observatory located within the bau research farm and are summarized in fig 1 soil moisture was measured gravimetrically at 150 mm intervals up to a depth of 1200 mm from each of two replications at sowing before and after each irrigation after any moderate 2 5 64 4 mm to heavy 64 4 mm bhatla et al 2019 rainfall event and at harvesting the observed soil water storage was measured for each soil depth at 150 mm intervals from 0 1200 mm and divided into two soil depths 0 450 mm and 450 1200 mm by summing the soil water storage for the respective depths bulk density for each layer was measured in each crop establishment treatment using the soil core ring method at the beginning and end of each cropping season and calculated according to blake and hartge 1986 2 4 statistical analyses the experimental data were analysed using analysis of variance anova with jmp sas software littell et al 2006 tukey s honest significant difference hsd test was used as a post hoc means separation test p 0 05 to validate the ability of the apsim model to simulate crop yield and biomass the root mean square error rmse for each of yield and biomass was calculated using the following equation r m s e 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 where oi and pi are the observed and simulated yield or biomass values respectively and n is the number of observations in the dataset observed and simulated grain yield and biomass were also compared using linear regression and the coefficient of determination r2 was calculated to test model performance as described by gaydon et al 2017 2 5 apsim calibration and validation the agricultural production systems simulator apsim holzworth et al 2014 keating et al 2003 cropping system model has been extensively tested and validated in a range of rice based production systems across south asia e g gaydon et al 2017 balwinder singh et al 2016 apsim was parameterised and calibrated to simulate rice maize cropping systems at the bau research farm using the first year of experimental data and independently validated using the second year experimental data following the best practice cropping system modelling approach described in gaydon et al 2017 these calibration and validation data included field measurements of soil variables soil moisture during the maize growing season dates of crop phenological development and above ground biomass and crop yield the soil texture was analysed using bouyocous hydrometer method piper 1966 the volumetric water content at the drained upper limit dul and lower limit ll of each layer was determined using pressure plate apparatus at 33 and 1500 kpa respectively the volumetric water content from each layer was determined periodically from gravimetric water content of soil samples collected using an auger and bulk density for each layer under different tillage methods were measured using soil core samplers dastane 1967 the volumetric water content at saturation was estimated using the methods described by dalgliesh and foale 1998 the values used for different soil parameters in ct and zt cropping systems are presented in table 2 we used apsim version 7 5 with the apsim oryza based on oryza 2000 bouman and van laar 2006 and apsim maize crop submodules to simulation crop development and production the soilwat and surface organic matter submodules were used to assess soil water characteristics and residue management practices respectively while the soilwat submodule was used to model water infiltration and movement in the soil tillage practices do not have a direct effect on the soilwat characteristics yang et al 2018 these were captured separately soils under ct rice have a compacted layer at approximately 200 300 mm which is less permeable and has a saturated percolation rate ks half that of the ks observed at the same depth in soils under zt direct seeded rice gathala et al 2011 we assumed the different ks values at the compacted layer under ct and zt establishment influenced not only water movement through the soil but also the water extraction efficiency kl of maize as root growth is impeded through the compacted layer which was still observed in the dry season crop following rice this approach to modelling soils under ct and zt has been previously demonstrated in a tropical rice growing ecology by laing et al 2018 hydrology in rice based cropping systems was simulated using the pond submodule gaydon et al 2012 2 6 apsim rice maize scenarios following the satisfactory parameterisation calibration and validation of apsim long term simulations were derived with confidence based on the experimental treatments described above following the commonly used cropping system simulation strategy e g balwinder singh et al 2016 laing et al 2018 in the baseline ct simulation transplanted rice and manually line sown maize were established in ploughed fields with no residue retained representing farmers conventional practice in zt simulations both rice and maize were mechanically directly sown into untilled soil with 30 of residues retained from the previous crop in all simulation scenarios maize was sown in the first week of november every year and in both rice and maize crops fertilizer was applied following best practice guidelines so as to be non limiting in rice irrigation water was applied as needed on a supplementary basis to establish the crop in a timely manner and ensure a rice crop each year this reflects farmer practice in maize five irrigation treatments were simulated with between two and six irrigations increasing by one irrigation with each treatment applied to the maize crop at each irrigation event water was applied until the soil reached field capacity farmers in the eastern gangetic plain typically irrigate maize at key crop phenological stages so the timing of irrigation events followed that of the experimental trials as described in table 1 the calibrated parameterised and independently validated apsim simulations were run with 49 years meteorological data from the bau experimental farm 1960 2018 to examine over the longer term the crop productivity water use efficiency diesel use and gross margins of maize within a rice maize system 2 7 economic analyses we examined the cost of production cop i e cost of all inputs required to produce a crop product and simple gross margin gm i e value of the grain produced when sold at market minus the cop under different long term apsim scenarios to quantify the economic impact of crop establishment method and irrigation management practice on maize within a rice maize system using economic data recorded from a local agricultural market in bhagalpur bihar through the duration of the experimental field trials the prices farmers received for their maize crop were very close to i e equal or up to 5 higher than the government of india mandated minimum support price for maize variations in the cost of production in this study relate to differences in irrigation use between treatments all other production costs are held equal across treatments the costs of the cropping system inputs considered in these analyses i e seed fertilizer labor plant protection measures such as herbicides and pesticides and the diesel used for mechanised operations including land preparation irrigation harvesting and post harvest processing were recorded over the two year experiment we did not consider fixed costs including the costs of irrigation infrastructure in these analyses as they are consistent across treatments labor costs were 261 indian rupees inr day 1 with no difference between male and female field workers labor hire rates paid by bihar agricultural university were similar to within 10 of wages paid to laborers on nearby private farms the price of diesel was 75 inr l 1 and the maize grain minimum support price set by the government of india was 14 250 inr t 1 the maize variable cop was calculated by summing the costs of seed agro chemicals labour diesel fuel for tillage sowing and operation of irrigation pumps and machinery hiring costs of tillage implements zt machines and threshers we assumed the farming

cop from the marketable value of the maize i e grain yield x maize minimum support price the minimum support price is at par with the local market price that farmers achieved when selling their maize grain our economic analysis did not include the value of land costs for establishment of irrigation infrastructure or machinery depreciation economic data are reported in usd where 1 usd 72 inr to examine the economic effects of different crop management practices in the long term cop and gm were calculated each year using the present day values observed in the experiments 3 results 3 1 field trial experiments maize grain yields were consistently and significantly higher under zt than under ct by 4 11 in 2016 17 and 2 9 in 2017 18 table 3 maize irrigation treatments significantly affected not only maize biomass and grain yield but also rice grain yield the medium duration rice variety arize 6444 produced a significantly 3 4 higher grain yield than the short duration rice variety nk 5251 in both experimental years there were no clear trends in rice grain yield under the different crop establishment methods generally the two way and three way interactions between variables were not significant in terms of the performance of either maize or rice maize total biomass and grain yields were significantly higher by around 8 and 6 respectively when the crop was sown early after harvest of the short duration rice variety nk5251 than when it was sown later after harvest of the medium duration rice variety arize 6444 for all establishment methods and rice irrigation treatments maize biomass and grain yield increased significantly from two to four irrigations in maize and again from four to six irrigations in maize in rice crops both total above ground biomass and grain yield were significantly higher by around 5 and 3 5 respectively in the medium duration arize 6444 variety than the shorter duration nk5251 variety over both experimental years table 3 overall there were no clear significant differences in biomass or grain yield between rice establishment options ct or zt rice nor in the different rainfall based irrigation schedules in general zt rice irrigated when the cumulative rainfall threshold for irrigation was 60 mm in either the preceding five or ten days i e the two scenarios where more irrigation water was applied to zt rice produced grain yields comparable to those achieved in the ct rice crop zt rice irrigated when the cumulative rainfall threshold for irrigation was 30 mm in the preceding five or ten days i e the scenarios where less irrigation water was applied achieved grain yields 4 9 lower than those in the ct rice crop a residual effect of maize irrigation on subsequent rice yields was observed during the second year of the experiment when treatments receiving only two irrigations in the maize crop produced significantly lower rice grain yields than treatments receiving four or six irrigations in maize the average depth of soil water storage sws for upper 0 450 mm and lower 450 1200 mm soil layers increased with increasing irrigation at the beginning of the maize cropping season zt maize plots had higher sws than ct maize plots at the lowest irrigation treatment i2 the sws was similar across the two tillage methods at both soil layers however under i4 and i6 irrigation treatments when more water was applied higher sws in zt maize than in ct maize was observed up until crop harvest in both soil layers in the first year the difference in sws between the tillage methods particularly in the upper layer was however reduced during the second experimental year in the flowering to grain filling period due to receipt of rainfall during this time the sws in ct maize in the 0 450 mm layer ranged between 88 115 mm in the 2016 17 season and between 94 119 mm in the 2017 18 season across all irrigation treatments supplementary table 1 in zt maize the sws in the 0 450 mm layer varied between 91 125 mm in the first year and 95 123 mm in the second year across all irrigation treatments similarly we observed a consistent trend for higher sws under zt maize than under ct maize in the lower soil layer i e 450 1200 mm 3 2 apsim calibration and validation overall apsim simulations satisfactorily predicted the observed performance of rice and maize in both ct and zt tillage systems and under different irrigation moisture regimes for both rice and maize crops observed and simulated grain yield and biomass values present good agreement under both ct and zt establishment for both calibration 2016 17 and validation 2017 18 datasets and there was good agreement between rmse values for calibration and validation fig 2 and supplementary table 2 however r2 values for rice grain yield validation were lower around 0 08 0 26 than those for rice biomass validation 0 60 0 69 maize grain yield validation 0 91 0 96 or maize biomass validation 0 87 0 88 considerable lodging was observed in rice in both years of the experiment which did not affect biomass production but which did negatively affect yields lodging is not currently modelled in apsim simulations modelled biomass and for maize grain yield data were generally slightly 1 5 higher than observed data particularly in the validation dataset in both ct and zt systems apsim simulated well the observed phenology of both the rice varieties and the maize variety supplementary fig 1 both model calibration and validation showed very good agreement between the simulated and observed soil moisture fig 3 apsim captured not only the effect on soil moisture of the onset and duration of the monsoon season but also soil moisture under irrigated maize in the dry season the simulations estimated well the depth of soil water under both ct and zt management at both 0 450 mm and 450 1200 mm layers the rmse values of ct and zt systems for both the calibration and validation datasets and at both average soil layers are shown in supplementary table 1 3 3 rice maize scenarios 3 3 1 maize productivity under different tillage and water management practices over the longer term and across all five irrigation treatments average zt maize grain yields were always higher than ct maize grain yields fig 4 average maize grain yields were highest at the highest irrigation level i6 for both ct 10 6 t ha 1 and zt 11 3 t ha 1 and lowest at the lowest irrigation level i2 where ct grain yields were 6 9 t ha 1 and zt grain yields 7 6 t ha 1 under zt the average maize grain yield improved by around 11 percent in the i2 i3and i4 treatments and by 7 in the i5 and i6 treatments relative to average ct maize grain yields table 4 for i5 and i6 treatments zt and ct maize grain yields were very similar in both the best and worst years these similarities were not observed at lower irrigation treatments where zt yields clearly outperformed ct there was little variation in rice grain yields in ct and zt rice maize cropping systems however zt rice improved the lowest grain yields simulated supplementary fig 2 rice grain yields under zt ranged from 3 6 to 6 8 t ha 1 while under ct rice grain yields varied between 2 9 and 6 7 t ha 1 the average simulated long term zt rice grain yield was 3 6 higher 5 5 t ha 1 than that of ct rice 5 3 t ha 1 3 3 2 maize production costs under different tillage and water management practices the average total cost of production for ct maize was 13 16 higher than that of zt maize across all irrigation treatments table 4 the maximum difference in production cost between zt and ct maize was in the i6 treatment usd 112 ha 1 followed by the i5 and i2 treatments both usd 110 ha 1 irrigation costs were comparable across maize irrigation treatments regardless of crop establishment method the cost of each additional irrigation event generally decreased as more irrigation events were included while increasing the number of irrigation events from two i2 to three i3 increased the amount spent on irrigation by 48 50 usd ha 1 adding a fourth irrigation event i4 increased the cost of irrigation above i3 by only 17 18 usd ha 1 and increasing to six irrigations i6 from five i5 increased the cost above i5 by 13 14 usd ha 1 across all irrigation treatments the labour required to produce a zt maize crop 53 69 person days ha 1 was 34 43 less than that required to produce a ct maize crop 76 93 person days ha 1 similarly more diesel fuel was required in ct maize than in zt maize treatments and the fuel required in each treatment increased with increasing irrigation levels in zt maize the total diesel required varied between 91 174 l ha 1 while in ct maize the diesel required varied between 105 and 190 l ha 1 this was 8 15 higher under ct across the five irrigation treatments for each maize treatment the costs of crop establishment of agro chemicals i e fertilizers herbicides and pesticides and of machinery did not vary with maize irrigation in zt maize the cost of establishment 31 usd ha 1 was significantly lower than in ct maize 156 usd ha 1 this was due both to the large amount of fuel required for land preparation under ct and the higher labor required agro chemical costs were 3 3 higher under zt maize 359 usd ha 1 than under ct maize 347 usd ha 1 largely due to greater use of chemicals to control pests and diseases in zt maize the cost of machinery under zt maize was 37 usd ha 1 while under ct maize it was 58 usd ha 1 reflecting the greater use of machinery in ct systems for land preparation the number of irrigation events affected the costs of production in both ct and zt maize the total cost of crop production varied between 687 834 usd ha 1in zt maize and between 797 946 usd ha 1in ct maize with costs lowest in the i2 scenario and highest in the i6 scenario 3 3 3 maize water use efficiency maize grain yields total cost of production and gross margins all increased with increasing irrigation following an approximate logarithmic curve fig 5 the zt maize treatments performed better than ct maize treatments across agronomic productivity water use efficiency and economic metrics for every irrigation treatment maize water use efficiency was highest in the i2 treatment 54 8 kg ha mm 1 and 48 4 kg ha mm 1 for zt and ct respectively water use efficiency declined with increasing irrigation with lowest values in the i5 and i6 treatments 37 48 kg ha mm 1 and 34 35 kg ha mm 1 for zt and ct respectively 3 3 4 maize gross margin and return per dollar spent gross margins gm were lowest when least irrigation water was applied i2 and greatest for the highest irrigation levels fig 5d across all maize irrigation treatments gms were 20 39 higher under zt maize than under ct maize there was no significant difference in gm at the i5 and i6 treatments for both ct maize 1262 and 1284 usd ha 1 respectively and zt maize 1525 and 1536 usd ha 1 respectively gm variability as shown by a larger interquartile range iqr was higher at lower irrigation levels however gm variation under zt maize e g iqr of 266 usd ha 1 in i2 was considerably lower than the gm variation under ct maize e g iqr of 555 usd ha 1 in i2 for both zt and ct maize gm variability was lower at higher irrigation levels e g iqr of 144 usd ha 1 in zt i6 and 122 usd ha 1 in ct i6 the return per dollar spent to produce the maize crop increased with increasing irrigation level irrespective of crop establishment practice table 4 in ct maize the return per dollar spent was lower 0 86 1 36 at every irrigation level than it was under zt maize 1 39 1 84 for both zt and ct maize the return on dollar spent to produce the maize crop was lowest under i2 while increasing one irrigation to i3 increased the return by 29 in zt maize and 41 in ct maize the i5 treatment recorded the highest return per dollar spent this was 37 higher in zt maize 1 86 than in ct maize 1 36 the i2 irrigation in ct maize gave a return per dollar spent of less than 1 indicating that two irrigations in dry season ct maize is not a profitable option 4 discussion 4 1 experimental trials productivity and water management results from the two year experiment show that for rice maize cropping systems in bihar zt maize resulted in significantly higher yields than ct maize and that yields from early sown maize i e maize sown after a short duration rice crop were higher than maize sown later after a medium duration rice crop table 3 mechanised establishment i e direct seeding of rice facilitates the early establishment and thus early harvesting of rice contributing to the timely sowing of maize the humid climate of the bihar region of the eastern gangetic plain features generally low and infrequent rainfall during the maize growing period the median long term 49 year rainfall received during the maize growing window ranged from 0 mm in november and december 10 mm in january 5 6 mm in february and march 14 mm in april and 82 mm in may fig 1b due to the risk of damage to the maize crop resulting from the potential for high rainfall in may associated with potentially heavy pre monsoon showers farmers prefer to harvest maize at the end of april or the beginning of may jat et al 2019 and gathala et al 2020b both observed increased yields in zt maize in the eastern gangetic plains particularly when maize was grown after zt rice zero tillage practices not only retain crop residues and thus reduce soil moisture losses they also reduce compaction and improve aggregation in soil which is severely negatively affected in traditional ct crop management kumar and ladha 2011 gathala et al 2011 2013 jat et al 2019 zt direct seeded rice has been shown to improve maize productivity in south asia by improving soil physical properties which facilitate better rooting in maize jat et al 2019 overall the productivity of zt cropping systems has been shown to outperform that of ct cropping systems across the eastern gangetic plains islam et al 2019 gathala et al 2020b maize grain yields were significantly higher at higher irrigation treatments table 3 relative to current farmer practice of six irrigations in maize i6 maize grain yields under four irrigations i4 were 5 8 lower with two irrigations i2 grain yields decreased by 35 40 the additional water available in the higher irrigation treatments resulted in additional biomass production which increased actual evapotranspiration this result was also observed by irmak et al 2016 increasing maize grain yield with increased irrigation was also reported by farré and faci 2009 increasing the irrigation levels increased the evapotranspiration positively li and sun 2016 which was also positively correlated with the maize grain yield increase lenka et al 2009 both in this experiment and in the studies cited the maize grain yield increase was more prominent under dry season conditions where there is little or no in crop rainfall in zt maize for all irrigation treatments we observed reductions in bulk density of 2 3 and higher in the first year or comparable in the second year soil moisture content compared to ct maize fig 3 these results are in concordance with those observed by singh et al 2016 who observed a decrease in bulk density of 7 8 over five years in a zt rice maize system on a sandy loam soil compared to a ct baseline a zt rice maize system has a higher root mass density than a ct rice maize system singh et al 2016 and puddling increases soil compaction gathala et al 2011 thus the modest improvement in soil bulk density observed here after four crop cycles under zt is feasible previous studies have also demonstrated that retention of crop straw significantly reduces soil evaporation which also considerably increases the soil water storage perry 2011 huang et al 2005 thereby improving the crop water consumption the duration of the rice growing season which varied by variety significantly affected both rice grain yield and the productivity of the following maize crop table 3 in both experimental years heavy rainfall during rice grain filling resulted in lodging and yield losses across crop establishment methods ct and zt rice produced similar grain yields indicating that in the region of the eastern gangetic plain this zt direct seeded rice can replace ct management with no yield penalty for farmers similar comparable performances of ct and zt rice have been reported in south asia by sudhir yadav et al 2011 and bhushan et al 2007 in rice wheat systems kumar and ladha 2011 and gathala et al 2011 recorded higher grain yields in zt direct seeded rice than in ct rice in rice wheat systems in north western india they attributed discrepancies in rice yields to rainfall variability there were no significant grain yield differences between zt direct seeded rice and the ct rice baseline under any rainfall based irrigation strategy table 3 applying irrigation when less than 60 mm cumulative rainfall was received in either the preceding five or ten days produced slightly but not significantly higher yields than treatments where the irrigation threshold was 30 mm cumulative rainfall in the preceding five or ten days lodging during the rice grain filling period in both experimental years may have obscured more significant trends 4 2 apsim evaluation the apsim calibration and validation demonstrated that the model simulated well the biomass and grain yield of maize and rice crops and soil moisture in both zt and ct systems fig 2 and supplementary table 2 while acceptable agreement was achieved between observed and simulated data in both ct and zt rice observed rice grain yields were affected by lodging similar differences due to climatic factors were observed in wheat by asseng et al 2004 and bassu et al 2009 overall apsim slightly over estimated grain yield and biomass in both crops as the model does not account for the small productivity losses caused by pests weeds and disease in even well managed field trials apsim satisfactorily captured the difference in maize grain yield and biomass due to tillage differences and irrigation regimes similar model performance has been reported in south eastern australia pembleton et al 2013 and in the north china plains chen et al 2010 liu et al 2013 other studies in rice wheat systems e g peake et al 2014 mohanty et al 2012 were unable to accurately model observed production data this may have been a result of the model underestimating nitrogen uptake by the crop in this study nitrogen is non limiting apsim simulated well improved maize productivity under zt and accurately modelled improved soil water storage in the rice maize zt system as a result of altered soil physical and hydrological parameters fig 3 and supplementary tables 1 and 2 similar simulation results for maize productivity and soil water storage under different establishment methods were observed by yang et al 2018 in china the performance of apsim with a high degree of precision in rice based cropping systems when calibrated with location specific soil crop and management data has been reported by previous work laing et al 2018 gaydon et al 2012 2017 hochman et al 2017 poulton et al 2016 the good agreement between observed and simulated data in the independent second year validation dataset enables apsim to be used with confidence in long term scenario analysis gaydon et al 2017 hochman et al 2017 4 3 apsim scenarios productivity and water management simulation of the rice maize system over the longer term 49 years indicated that maize grain yields were consistently higher under zt than under ct grain yields were also higher when more irrigation was applied fig 4 there was no significant difference in zt maize grain yields between the i5 and i6 treatments zt maize with four irrigations i4 achieved similar or higher grain yields to ct maize with six irrigations i6 this suggests that irrigation frequency could be reduced by farmers in combination with zt crop establishment to reduce production costs without reducing grain yield the long term simulation results clearly indicated higher maize grain yields under zt when irrigation was limited and the crop water stressed zt leads to better crop resilience under adverse conditions than ct islam et al 2019 reported that in rice maize systems in farmers fields in the eastern gangetic plains uptake of zt crop establishment reduced irrigation water requirements by 8 27 2 compared to the water required by farmers in a ct rice maize system at higher irrigation levels i5 and i6 average zt maize grain yields were 11 2 11 3 t ha 1 this was 8 9 higher than average ct yields for the same irrigation treatments for these high irrigation treatments the maximum maize grain yields i e those achieved in less than 5 of years were slightly 0 14 0 46 t ha 1 higher under ct than under zt this is likely to be a result of well timed rainfall received during the maize growing period which provided additional water for crop evapotranspiration overall and particularly in relatively low yielding years maize grain yield under i5 and i6 was comparable variation 1 0 while under ct grain yields varied between 2 and 4 the apsim simulations demonstrated that zt improved soil water storage which resulted in higher extractable soil water esw than under ct contributing to higher maize grain yield supplementary fig 3 esw was higher in zt maize than in ct maize at each irrigation event as a result of improved soil water storage reduced soil evaporation and lower deep drainage losses for most of the predominantly rainfed rice growing season esw was higher under zt than under ct however at the end of the wet season esw was higher under ct due to poorer drainage i e lower ks values under ct rice than under zt direct seeded rice rice grain yields under zt direct seeded rice were higher than under ct rice across all years supplementary fig 2 these long term simulation data agree with longer term i e 5 year field studies in south asia which report higher rice grain yields under direct seeded rice in zt systems than in ct systems kumar et al 2018 jat et al 2014 gathala et al 2013 these results suggest that zt direct seeded rice can improve grain yields under both sufficient and deficit rainfall conditions 4 4 cost of production and gross margin analyses maize production while new to the eastern gangetic plains is attractive to farmers due to the potential for high crop productivity and reduced risk of terminal heat stress of maize compared to wheat within the eastern gangetic plains there is high and growing demand for maize for both human and animal consumption fao 2018 gathala et al 2016 pandey et al 2019 in order to maximize maize production under traditional ct practices farmers apply high inputs which is resource intensive and expensive gathala et al 2020b the cost of land preparation and sowing zt maize was five times lower than ct maize ct maize also required more labour table 4 and fig 5 the reduction in irrigation water applied under zt maize for a comparable yield to that achieved under ct maize directly decreased maize production costs the cost of agro chemicals was 3 5 higher under zt maize due to increased herbicide applied to control weeds however this increase was offset by reduction in required labor reduced by 35 40 and fuel reduced by 8 15 under zt each additional irrigation event incurred a cost over the previous irrigation event however there was little difference in total production costs or gross margins between i5 and i6 farmers baseline maize management was ct with six irrigations i6 comparable average yields could be achieved in a zt system with four irrigations i4 and higher yields in a zt system with five i5 or six i6 irrigations fig 5a consequently and accounting for higher irrigation costs zt maize with five or six irrigations i5 i6 resulted in gross margins which were significantly greater than the average gm of the baseline ct i6 system while the gm under zt maize with only three i3 or four i4 irrigations was considerably greater than the average gm of the ct i6 system fig 5d economic returns to the farmer per dollar spent on producing i e establishing growing and harvesting the maize crop were higher with increasing amount of irrigation and consistently higher under zt than under ct the greatest return per dollar spent under ct maize 1 3 for i6 was less than the least return per dollar spent under zt maize 1 39 for i2 table 4 in agreement with our findings lower fuel and labor requirements under zt than under ct in rice maize cropping systems have also been reported by other researchers in south asia e g gathala et al 2020a b 2013 jat et al 2014 saharawat et al 2010 as have lower production costs and higher gross margins under zt maize than under ct maize gathala et al 2020b 2011 singh et al 2016 laik et al 2014 jat et al 2013 this study did not consider the sensitivity of key economic variables such as labor cost or fuel price nor did it examine rice maize cropping systems under future climate variability and change further research into these areas as well as a consideration of an enabling policy environment to best support the uptake of zt technologies by risk averse smallholder farmers are recommended 5 conclusion experimental field trials in a rice maize system in bihar in the eastern gangetic plain demonstrated that comparable yields were achieved under zero tillage zt with lower irrigation than under conventional tillage ct with higher irrigation zt maize management resulted in higher plant available soil water thereby improving crop water use efficiency reducing production costs and leading to higher gross margins and a greater return per dollar spent than ct maize for all irrigation treatments examined we used the experimental field trial data to successfully calibrate and validate a rice maize cropping system in apsim our long term scenario analyses demonstrated that 1 zt maize was more productive than ct maize 2 zt direct seeded rice grain yields were comparable to or higher than ct rice grain yields and had lower yield variability 3 soils in zt systems had higher extractable soil moisture than those in ct systems and 4 a zt rice maize cropping system achieves grain maize yields with less irrigation reduced production costs and higher gross margins than in a ct rice maize system zt maize production was more water efficient and thus more fuel efficient than ct maize largely because zt crop establishment practices combined with residue retention improved the soil physical condition and increased the amount of water available to plants in the soil these increased production efficiencies lowered production costs and increased gross margins in zt maize the growing popularity in dry season maize production across the eastern gangetic plain combined with volatility in fuel prices means that zt rice maize systems will be attractive to farmers zt maize production was more advantageous than ct maize for all irrigation strategies examined and will help mitigate against fluctuating production costs the results of this research have broader applications across relatively low rainfall regions of the eastern gangetic plain including bihar more broadly parts of uttar pradesh and the nepali terai as well as globally in other low rainfall

10457,in the eastern gangetic plain of south asia cropping systems under conventional crop management are frequently unprofitable due to the inefficient use of resources particularly irrigation water and energy across the eastern gangetic plain farmers generally produce a wet season rice crop followed by an irrigated dry season crop maize has been recently introduced as the dry season crop and is rapidly growing in popularity irrigation water is commonly applied using diesel powered pumps and fluctuating fuel prices are a major factor affecting cropping system profitability we hypothesised that the adoption of zero tillage crop establishment in a rice maize system would reduce irrigation requirements compared to a conventionally established rice maize system while maintaining comparable crop yields thus higher water use efficiency and economic profitability would be achieved under the improved crop management compared to conventional practice field experiments over two years in sabour bihar demonstrated that early sowing of maize resulted in 8 higher maize grain yields while zero tillage establishment produced 7 higher maize grain yields than conventionally established maize using the apsim cropping systems model we tested our hypothesis over 49 years from 1969 to 2018 over the longer term zero till maize grain yields were 9 higher than those of conventionally established crops under these improved management practices fuel savings of 8 15 and labor savings of 34 43 were achieved compared to conventionally managed crops leading to higher water use efficiency in all treatments under improved management overall gross margins in rice maize systems under improved management practices were 20 39 higher than rice maize systems under conventional management in rice maize cropping systems in the eastern gangetic plain improved crop management practices can improve the efficiency of water use and thus increase farming households profitability and incomes keywords

uttar pradesh bihar west bengal and assam as well as the terai plains of nepal and most of bangladesh ericksen et al 2011 islam et al 2019 gathala et al 2020a b this region is home to over 450 million people who live in some of the world s poorest agricultural communities ericksen et al 2011 yield gaps have been observed across the eastern gangetic plain in major crops including in rice wheat and

south asian food security islam et al 2019 gathala et al 2018 ifpri 2016 the eastern gangetic plain is dominated by rice based cropping with rice rice 6 51 m ha rice wheat 6 22 m ha and rice maize 1 0

annually a predominantly rainfed wet season june october rice crop followed by an irrigated dry season november april wheat crop islam et al 2019 recently maize has emerged as a more attractive option for the dry season crop than wheat as it is a more productive crop with greater tolerance for high temperatures maize plants are less affected by terminal heat stress than wheat and so the rice maize system is more water efficient productive and profitable than the rice wheat jat et al 2019 islam et al 2019 gathala et al 2020a b pandey et al 2019 the rice maize cropping system is now the second most common cropping system in the eastern gangetic plain jat et al 2018 in cereal based cropping in the egp including the area around bihar conventional management results in high production costs due to low use efficiency of resources humphreys et al 2010 saharawat et al 2010 jat et al 2014 efficient crop production is challenging in the eastern gangetic plain due to smaller field sizes land fragmentation and limited awareness of improved crop management practices it is necessary to evaluate technologies which have the potential to improve the efficiency of cropping system inputs such as water while maintaining or increasing crop yields jat et al 2014 moreover low crop yields in the eastern gangetic plain are aggravated by water stress due to limited access to irrigation water resulting from poor infrastructure and or the high cost of pumping water krupnik et al 2017 ifpri 2016 in order to maximise economic returns all cropping systems including rice maize systems must be well managed including the optimal application of inputs such as irrigation water traditional crop management practices used in any cropping system in the drier regions of the eastern gangetic plain including bihar rely heavily on diesel powered machinery both for pre sowing land preparation and to pump irrigation water the production of dry season crops relies completely on water available to the crop and is therefore driven by irrigation practice increasing use of irrigation puts stress on the groundwater system and requires ever increasing consumption of diesel to extract water from lower depths sugden et al 2014 irrigated crop production costs are strongly affected by diesel prices which are highly variable krupnik et al 2017 brown et al 2017 gathala et al 2016 apart from pumping costs farmers do not have to pay to extract water for agricultural irrigation moreover a delayed sowing of maize following a late harvested and or a longer duration wet season rice crop extends the maize grain filling and maturity window into the hot and dry may june period increasing the amount of irrigation required to fulfil crop evaporative demands and ensure grain filling these high production costs reduce farm profitability gathala et al 2016 brown et al 2017 improved crop management practices such as zero tillage zt crop establishment have been shown to improve cropping system productivity resource use efficiency and gross margins in cropping systems including rice maize cropping systems in the eastern gangetic plain region of south asia islam et al 2019 gathala et al 2015 cropping systems under zero tillage are more energy efficient than conventional tillage ct systems requiring less irrigation water to produce the same amount of grain islam et al 2019 gathala

et al 2019 gathala et al 2011 2020a 2020b jat et al 2018 combining zt crop establishment with residue retention and a short rather than medium duration rice cultivar facilitates the timeliness of both

profitability enabling them to produce a comparably sized grain yield for less water this has the potential to reduce groundwater extraction and increase farmers gross margins the potential benefits of reduced or no tillage in south asia have been demonstrated to include 79 95 reductions in tillage and crop establishment costs gathala et al 2011 50 70 fuel savings hossen et al 2018 islam et al

a relatively new cash crop in the drier regions of the eastern gangetic plain and while farmers recognise the benefit of concentrating their resources to maximise maize production there have been few studies to date on rice maize cropping systems in the region and none to examine strategies to best use irrigation water to maximise maize productivity while minimizing farmers exposure to high and variable diesel prices we have observed farmers transitioning from rice wheat to rice maize cropping systems under traditional management and in this research we seek to help farmers improve their cropping system efficiency by identifying options to improve crop management practices e g by replacing conventional tillage ct with zero tillage zt and by improving their irrigation water strategies both of which will reduce the diesel required to produce a maize crop in this paper we use the results from a two year rice maize irrigation experiment conducted over four cropping seasons between 2016 and 2018 in bihar india to parameterize and calibrate the cropping system model apsim agriculture production system simulator holzworth et al 2014 for rice maize production on a clay loam over sandy loam soil in a humid sub tropical climate we then used apsim to identify optimal irrigation management practices and to examine over the longer term the effects of irrigation and crop management practices on irrigation water use and cropping system productivity and profitability our research focuses on the use of irrigation water to produce dry season maize under traditional ct and improved zt management practices the results observed here for an experimental site in bihar are applicable throughout other lower rainfall regions of the eastern gangetic plain with similar agro ecologies to the study site e g the nepali terai and parts of the indian states of uttar pradesh and bihar and may have broader applications in other tropical to subtropical semiarid cropping systems where subsistence farmers require options for efficient agronomic water management to maximise their cropping system productivity and profitability 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was carried out in the north central eastern gangetic plain at the research farm of bihar agricultural university bau 87 2 42 e 25 15 40 n 37 m above mean sea level sabour in bihar india between 2016 and 2018 the climate of the area is tropical to subtropical with a relatively low average annual rainfall of 1250 mm most of which falls from the middle of june to the middle of october daily maximum temperatures are highest up to 45 oc between may and june and the minimum temperature is lowest around 3 oc in early january the soil of the experimental site is classified as clay loam 0 300 mm in the upper layer and sandy loam 300 1200 mm at lower soil depths table 2 groundwater depth is variable between five and ten metres in the pre and post monsoon seasons government of india 2016 existing irrigation infrastructure was used during the experiment 2 2 experimental treatments we examined the performance of rice maize systems across two different establishment methods three different irrigation treatments in maize and with two rice varieties of different growing season lengths the experiment was laid out in a factorial plot design with three replications each replication was divided into two halves representing two varieties for rice and two sowing times for maize each rice variety was sub divided into five levels comprising of four rainfall based irrigation treatments in zero till zt direct seeded rice and one puddled transplanted conventional till ct rice with conventional management practice the first experimental factor was rice varieties whose different growing season durations short or medium created different sowing windows for the maize variety the second experimental factor was tillage system zt rice was sown with retained residues from the previous crop winter maize was grown in the plot prior to the commencement of the experiment and followed by zero till zt maize while ct rice was followed by ct maize the third experimental factor was irrigation with two four or six irrigations applied in maize there were 30 experimental plots of 2m 5m the treatment factors are summarized in table 1 and described in more detail below two hybrid rice varieties were sown nk 5251 120 125 days duration and arize 6444 130 135 days duration the maize variety p 3396 160 165 days duration was sown within seven days of harvesting rice in the eastern gangetic plain farmers grow a variety of rice cultivars leading to a wide window in which rice harvesting and maize sowing occurs the three crop varieties grown in this experiment were all widely available in the eastern gangetic plain and representative of those grown in farmers fields around bau in the conventionally tilled ct system puddled transplanted rice seedlings were manually transplanted into soil which had received five pre establishment land preparation operations e g ploughing levelling etc in ct maize fields were similarly ploughed five times before maize seeds were manually sown in rows both ct crops were harvested at ground level leaving no surface residue on the soil this reflects farmer practice where crop residues are commonly either removed to use as animal feeds or fuel for cooking or burned in situ in contrast in the zero till zt cropping systems rice and maize were both mechanically directly seeded within the retained anchored residue of the previous crop with no pre establishment land preparation in zt treatments approximately 100 150 mm 1 6 2 1 t ha 1 and 200 250 mm 2 1 2 6 t ha 1 of rice and maize stubble respectively were retained in the field after each crop in all ct and zt treatments weeds pests and diseases were controlled chemically following best practice guidelines sohane 2019 spot weeding was performed manually if required we did not observe a difference in pest or disease presence between ct and zt treatments nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were applied at rates of 120 60 and 40 kg ha 1 respectively in rice and 150 75 and 50 kg ha 1 respectively in maize as urea diammonium phosphate dap and muriate of potash respectively in ct and zt rice nitrogen was applied in three equal splits while the phosphorus and potassium were applied at crop establishment the first nitrogen split was applied at sowing for zt rice or at transplanting for ct rice the second at maximum tillering and the third at panicle initiation in maize one third of nitrogen and the entire doses of phosphorus and potassium were applied at sowing the remaining nitrogen was applied in two equal splits at v6 v8 appearance of 6 8 leaves and at v10 v12 appearance of 10 12 leaves ct rice was predominantly rainfed with supplementary irrigation being used if needed to ensure timely crop establishment and growth supplementary irrigation was applied to a depth of 50 mm for the first 20 days after transplanting if there was no standing water subsequently supplementary irrigation was applied if hairline cracks appeared approximately five to seven days after standing water had disappeared this irrigation strategy reflects recommended best practice sohane 2019 in zt rice there were four different irrigation treatments which varied depending on the amount of rainfall received within a predetermined period of time plots were irrigated to a depth of 50 mm when less than either 30 mm or 60 mm of cumulative rainfall had been received within the preceding five or ten days in the dry season maize crop there were three irrigation treatments for both establishment methods 60 mm of water was applied at each treatment at different phenological stages for the i2 treatment irrigation was applied twice at six leaf stage v6 and before silking for i4 it was applied four times at four leaf stage v4 10 leaf stage v10 before silking and before milking and for i6 irrigation was applied six times at v4 8 leaf stage v8 at booting before silking before milking and at the dough stage the i6 treatment represents common farmer practice in the eastern gangetic plain region around bihar irrigation water was applied using 150 mm diameter polyvinyl chloride pipes and the amount of water applied in each plot was calculated based on the discharge rate from the pipe and the duration for which water was applied in each plot the discharge rate was measured before each irrigation to ensure the predetermined amount of water was consistently applied in each plot 2 3 climate and soil data daily meteorological data maximum and minimum temperature precipitation and solar radiation were obtained from the meteorological observatory located within the bau research farm and are summarized in fig 1 soil moisture was measured gravimetrically at 150 mm intervals up to a depth of 1200 mm from each of two replications at sowing before and after each irrigation after any moderate 2 5 64 4 mm to heavy 64 4 mm bhatla et al 2019 rainfall event and at harvesting the observed soil water storage was measured for each soil depth at 150 mm intervals from 0 1200 mm and divided into two soil depths 0 450 mm and 450 1200 mm by summing the soil water storage for the respective depths bulk density for each layer was measured in each crop establishment treatment using the soil core ring method at the beginning and end of each cropping season and calculated according to blake and hartge 1986 2 4 statistical analyses the experimental data were analysed using analysis of variance anova with jmp sas software littell et al 2006 tukey s honest significant difference hsd test was used as a post hoc means separation test p 0 05 to validate the ability of the apsim model to simulate crop yield and biomass the root mean square error rmse for each of yield and biomass was calculated using the following equation r m s e 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 where oi and pi are the observed and simulated yield or biomass values respectively and n is the number of observations in the dataset observed and simulated grain yield and biomass were also compared using linear regression and the coefficient of determination r2 was calculated to test model performance as described by gaydon et al 2017 2 5 apsim calibration and validation the agricultural production systems simulator apsim holzworth et al 2014 keating et al 2003 cropping system model has been extensively tested and validated in a range of rice based production systems across south asia e g gaydon et al 2017 balwinder singh et al 2016 apsim was parameterised and calibrated to simulate rice maize cropping systems at the bau research farm using the first year of experimental data and independently validated using the second year experimental data following the best practice cropping system modelling approach described in gaydon et al 2017 these calibration and validation data included field measurements of soil variables soil moisture during the maize growing season dates of crop phenological development and above ground biomass and crop yield the soil texture was analysed using bouyocous hydrometer method piper 1966 the volumetric water content at the drained upper limit dul and lower limit ll of each layer was determined using pressure plate apparatus at 33 and 1500 kpa respectively the volumetric water content from each layer was determined periodically from gravimetric water content of soil samples collected using an auger and bulk density for each layer under different tillage methods were measured using soil core samplers dastane 1967 the volumetric water content at saturation was estimated using the methods described by dalgliesh and foale 1998 the values used for different soil parameters in ct and zt cropping systems are presented in table 2 we used apsim version 7 5 with the apsim oryza based on oryza 2000 bouman and van laar 2006 and apsim maize crop submodules to simulation crop development and production the soilwat and surface organic matter submodules were used to assess soil water characteristics and residue management practices respectively while the soilwat submodule was used to model water infiltration and movement in the soil tillage practices do not have a direct effect on the soilwat characteristics yang et al 2018 these were captured separately soils under ct rice have a compacted layer at approximately 200 300 mm which is less permeable and has a saturated percolation rate ks half that of the ks observed at the same depth in soils under zt direct seeded rice gathala et al 2011 we assumed the different ks values at the compacted layer under ct and zt establishment influenced not only water movement through the soil but also the water extraction efficiency kl of maize as root growth is impeded through the compacted layer which was still observed in the dry season crop following rice this approach to modelling soils under ct and zt has been previously demonstrated in a tropical rice growing ecology by laing et al 2018 hydrology in rice based cropping systems was simulated using the pond submodule gaydon et al 2012 2 6 apsim rice maize scenarios following the satisfactory parameterisation calibration and validation of apsim long term simulations were derived with confidence based on the experimental treatments described above following the commonly used cropping system simulation strategy e g balwinder singh et al 2016 laing et al 2018 in the baseline ct simulation transplanted rice and manually line sown maize were established in ploughed fields with no residue retained representing farmers conventional practice in zt simulations both rice and maize were mechanically directly sown into untilled soil with 30 of residues retained from the previous crop in all simulation scenarios maize was sown in the first week of november every year and in both rice and maize crops fertilizer was applied following best practice guidelines so as to be non limiting in rice irrigation water was applied as needed on a supplementary basis to establish the crop in a timely manner and ensure a rice crop each year this reflects farmer practice in maize five irrigation treatments were simulated with between two and six irrigations increasing by one irrigation with each treatment applied to the maize crop at each irrigation event water was applied until the soil reached field capacity farmers in the eastern gangetic plain typically irrigate maize at key crop phenological stages so the timing of irrigation events followed that of the experimental trials as described in table 1 the calibrated parameterised and independently validated apsim simulations were run with 49 years meteorological data from the bau experimental farm 1960 2018 to examine over the longer term the crop productivity water use efficiency diesel use and gross margins of maize within a rice maize system 2 7 economic analyses we examined the cost of production cop i e cost of all inputs required to produce a crop product and simple gross margin gm i e value of the grain produced when sold at market minus the cop under different long term apsim scenarios to quantify the economic impact of crop establishment method and irrigation management practice on maize within a rice maize system using economic data recorded from a local agricultural market in bhagalpur bihar through the duration of the experimental field trials the prices farmers received for their maize crop were very close to i e equal or up to 5 higher than the government of india mandated minimum support price for maize variations in the cost of production in this study relate to differences in irrigation use between treatments all other production costs are held equal across treatments the costs of the cropping system inputs considered in these analyses i e seed fertilizer labor plant protection measures such as herbicides and pesticides and the diesel used for mechanised operations including land preparation irrigation harvesting and post harvest processing were recorded over the two year experiment we did not consider fixed costs including the costs of irrigation infrastructure in these analyses as they are consistent across treatments labor costs were 261 indian rupees inr day 1 with no difference between male and female field workers labor hire rates paid by bihar agricultural university were similar to within 10 of wages paid to laborers on nearby private farms the price of diesel was 75 inr l 1 and the maize grain minimum support price set by the government of india was 14 250 inr t 1 the maize variable cop was calculated by summing the costs of seed agro chemicals labour diesel fuel for tillage sowing and operation of irrigation pumps and machinery hiring costs of tillage implements zt machines and threshers we assumed the farming household used its own pump and irrigated from previously established tubewells this is very common in the eastern gangetic plain region around bihar gross margin gm was calculated by subtracting the cop from the marketable value of the maize i e grain yield x maize minimum support price the minimum support price is at par with the local market price that farmers achieved when selling their maize grain our economic analysis did not include the value of land costs for establishment of irrigation infrastructure or machinery depreciation economic data are reported in usd where 1 usd 72 inr to examine the economic effects of different crop management practices in the long term cop and gm were calculated each year using the present day values observed in the experiments 3 results 3 1 field trial experiments maize grain yields were consistently and significantly higher under zt than under ct by 4 11 in 2016 17 and 2 9 in 2017 18 table 3 maize irrigation treatments significantly affected not only maize biomass and grain yield but also rice grain yield the medium duration rice variety arize 6444 produced a significantly 3 4 higher grain yield than the short duration rice variety nk 5251 in both experimental years there were no clear trends in rice grain yield under the different crop establishment methods generally the two way and three way interactions between variables were not significant in terms of the performance of either maize or rice maize total biomass and grain yields were significantly higher by around 8 and 6 respectively when the crop was sown early after harvest of the short duration rice variety nk5251 than when it was sown later after harvest of the medium duration rice variety arize 6444 for all establishment methods and rice irrigation treatments maize biomass and grain yield increased significantly from two to four irrigations in maize and again from four to six irrigations in maize in rice crops both total above ground biomass and grain yield were significantly higher by around 5 and 3 5 respectively in the medium duration arize 6444 variety than the shorter duration nk5251 variety over both experimental years table 3 overall there were no clear significant differences in biomass or grain yield between rice establishment options ct or zt rice nor in the different rainfall based irrigation schedules in general zt rice irrigated when the cumulative rainfall threshold for irrigation was 60 mm in either the preceding five or ten days i e the two scenarios where more irrigation water was applied to zt rice produced grain yields comparable to those achieved in the ct rice crop zt rice irrigated when the cumulative rainfall threshold for irrigation was 30 mm in the preceding five or ten days i e the scenarios where less irrigation water was applied achieved grain yields 4 9 lower than those in the ct rice crop a residual effect of maize irrigation on subsequent rice yields was observed during the second year of the experiment when treatments receiving only two irrigations in the maize crop produced significantly lower rice grain yields than treatments receiving four or six irrigations in maize the average depth of soil water storage sws for upper 0 450 mm and lower 450 1200 mm soil layers increased with increasing irrigation at the beginning of the maize cropping season zt maize plots had higher sws than ct maize plots at the lowest irrigation treatment i2 the sws was similar across the two tillage methods at both soil layers however under i4 and i6 irrigation treatments when more water was applied higher sws in zt maize than in ct maize was observed up until crop harvest in both soil layers in the first year the difference in sws between the tillage methods particularly in the upper layer was however reduced during the second experimental year in the flowering to grain filling period due to receipt of rainfall during this time the sws in ct maize in the 0 450 mm layer ranged between 88 115 mm in the 2016 17 season and between 94 119 mm in the 2017 18 season across all irrigation treatments supplementary table 1 in zt maize the sws in the 0 450 mm layer varied between 91 125 mm in the first year and 95 123 mm in the second year across all irrigation treatments similarly we observed a consistent trend for higher sws under zt maize than under ct maize in the lower soil layer i e 450 1200 mm 3 2 apsim calibration and validation overall apsim simulations satisfactorily predicted the observed performance of rice and maize in both ct and zt tillage systems and under different irrigation moisture regimes for both rice and maize crops observed and simulated grain yield and biomass values present good agreement under both ct and zt establishment for both calibration 2016 17 and validation 2017 18 datasets and there was good agreement between rmse values for calibration and validation fig 2 and supplementary table 2 however r2 values for rice grain yield validation were lower around 0 08 0 26 than those for rice biomass validation 0 60 0 69 maize grain yield validation 0 91 0 96 or maize biomass validation 0 87 0 88 considerable lodging was observed in rice in both years of the experiment which did not affect biomass production but which did negatively affect yields lodging is not currently modelled in apsim simulations modelled biomass and for maize grain yield data were generally slightly 1 5 higher than observed data particularly in the validation dataset in both ct and zt systems apsim simulated well the observed phenology of both the rice varieties and the maize variety supplementary fig 1 both model calibration and validation showed very good agreement between the simulated and observed soil moisture fig 3 apsim captured not only the effect on soil moisture of the onset and duration of the monsoon season but also soil moisture under irrigated maize in the dry season the simulations estimated well the depth of soil water under both ct and zt management at both 0 450 mm and 450 1200 mm layers the rmse values of ct and zt systems for both the calibration and validation datasets and at both average soil layers are shown in supplementary table 1 3 3 rice maize scenarios 3 3 1 maize productivity under different tillage and water management practices over the longer term and across all five irrigation treatments average zt maize grain yields were always higher than ct maize grain yields fig 4 average maize grain yields were highest at the highest irrigation level i6 for both ct 10 6 t ha 1 and zt 11 3 t ha 1 and lowest at the lowest irrigation level i2 where ct grain yields were 6 9 t ha 1 and zt grain yields 7 6 t ha 1 under zt the average maize grain yield improved by around 11 percent in the i2 i3and i4 treatments and by 7 in the i5 and i6 treatments relative to average ct maize grain yields table 4 for i5 and i6 treatments zt and ct maize grain yields were very similar in both the best and worst years these similarities were not observed at lower irrigation treatments where zt yields clearly outperformed ct there was little variation in rice grain yields in ct and zt rice maize cropping systems however zt rice improved the lowest grain yields simulated supplementary fig 2 rice grain yields under zt ranged from 3 6 to 6 8 t ha 1 while under ct rice grain yields varied between 2 9 and 6 7 t ha 1 the average simulated long term zt rice grain yield was 3 6 higher 5 5 t ha 1 than that of ct rice 5 3 t ha 1 3 3 2 maize production costs under different tillage and water management practices the average total cost of production for ct maize was 13 16 higher than that of zt maize across all irrigation treatments table 4 the maximum difference in production cost between zt and ct maize was in the i6 treatment usd 112 ha 1 followed by the i5 and i2 treatments both usd 110 ha 1 irrigation costs were comparable across maize irrigation treatments regardless of crop establishment method the cost of each additional irrigation event generally decreased as more irrigation events were included while increasing the number of irrigation events from two i2 to three i3 increased the amount spent on irrigation by 48 50 usd ha 1 adding a fourth irrigation event i4 increased the cost of irrigation above i3 by only 17 18 usd ha 1 and increasing to six irrigations i6 from five i5 increased the cost above i5 by 13 14 usd ha 1 across all irrigation treatments the labour required to produce a zt maize crop 53 69 person days ha 1 was 34 43 less than that required to produce a ct maize crop 76 93 person days ha 1 similarly more diesel fuel was required in ct maize than in zt maize treatments and the fuel required in each treatment increased with increasing irrigation levels in zt maize the total diesel required varied between 91 174 l ha 1 while in ct maize the diesel required varied between 105 and 190 l ha 1 this was 8 15 higher under ct across the five irrigation treatments for each maize treatment the costs of crop establishment of agro chemicals i e fertilizers herbicides and pesticides and of machinery did not vary with maize irrigation in zt maize the cost of establishment 31 usd ha 1 was significantly lower than in ct maize 156 usd ha 1 this was due both to the large amount of fuel required for land preparation under ct and the higher labor required agro chemical costs were 3 3 higher under zt maize 359 usd ha 1 than under ct maize 347 usd ha 1 largely due to greater use of chemicals to control pests and diseases in zt maize the cost of machinery under zt maize was 37 usd ha 1 while under ct maize it was 58 usd ha 1 reflecting the greater use of machinery in ct systems for land preparation the number of irrigation events affected the costs of production in both ct and zt maize the total cost of crop production varied between 687 834 usd ha 1in zt maize and between 797 946 usd ha 1in ct maize with costs lowest in the i2 scenario and highest in the i6 scenario 3 3 3 maize water use efficiency maize grain yields total cost of production and gross margins all increased with increasing irrigation following an approximate logarithmic curve fig 5 the zt maize treatments performed better than ct maize treatments across agronomic productivity water use efficiency and economic metrics for every irrigation treatment maize water use efficiency was highest in the i2 treatment 54 8 kg ha mm 1 and 48 4 kg ha mm 1 for zt and ct respectively water use efficiency declined with increasing irrigation with lowest values in the i5 and i6 treatments 37 48 kg ha mm 1 and 34 35 kg ha mm 1 for zt and ct respectively 3 3 4 maize gross margin and return per dollar spent gross margins gm were lowest when least irrigation water was applied i2 and greatest for the highest irrigation levels fig 5d across all maize irrigation treatments gms were 20 39 higher under zt maize than under ct maize there was no significant difference in gm at the i5 and i6 treatments for both ct maize 1262 and 1284 usd ha 1 respectively and zt maize 1525 and 1536 usd ha 1 respectively gm variability as shown by a larger interquartile range iqr was higher at lower irrigation levels however gm variation under zt maize e g iqr of 266 usd ha 1 in i2 was considerably lower than the gm variation under ct maize e g iqr of 555 usd ha 1 in i2 for both zt and ct maize gm variability was lower at higher irrigation levels e g iqr of 144 usd ha 1 in zt i6 and 122 usd ha 1 in ct i6 the return per dollar spent to produce the maize crop increased with increasing irrigation level irrespective of crop establishment practice table 4 in ct maize the return per dollar spent was lower 0 86 1 36 at every irrigation level than it was under zt maize 1 39 1 84 for both zt and ct maize the return on dollar spent to produce the maize crop was lowest under i2 while increasing one irrigation to i3 increased the return by 29 in zt maize and 41 in ct maize the i5 treatment recorded the highest return per dollar spent this was 37 higher in zt maize 1 86 than in ct maize 1 36 the i2 irrigation in ct maize gave a return per dollar spent of less than 1 indicating that two irrigations in dry season ct maize is not a profitable option 4 discussion 4 1 experimental trials productivity and water management results from the two year experiment show that for rice maize cropping systems in bihar zt maize resulted in significantly higher yields than ct maize and that yields from early sown maize i e maize sown after a short duration rice crop were higher than maize sown later after a medium duration rice crop table 3 mechanised establishment i e direct seeding of rice facilitates the early establishment and thus early harvesting of rice contributing to the timely sowing of maize the humid climate of the bihar region of the eastern gangetic plain features generally low and infrequent rainfall during the maize growing period the median long term 49 year rainfall received during the maize growing window ranged from 0 mm in november and december 10 mm in january 5 6 mm in february and march 14 mm in april and 82 mm in may fig 1b due to the risk of damage to the maize crop resulting from the potential for high rainfall in may associated with potentially heavy pre monsoon showers farmers prefer to harvest maize at the end of april or the beginning of may jat et al 2019 and gathala et al 2020b both observed increased yields in zt maize in the eastern gangetic plains particularly when maize was grown after zt rice zero tillage practices not only retain crop residues and thus reduce soil moisture losses they also reduce compaction and improve aggregation in soil which is severely negatively affected in traditional ct crop management kumar and ladha 2011 gathala et al 2011 2013 jat et al 2019 zt direct seeded rice has been shown to improve maize productivity in south asia by improving soil physical properties which facilitate better rooting in maize jat et al 2019 overall the productivity of zt cropping systems has been shown to outperform that of ct cropping systems across the eastern gangetic plains islam et al 2019 gathala et al 2020b maize grain yields were significantly higher at higher irrigation treatments table 3 relative to current farmer practice of six irrigations in maize i6 maize grain yields under four irrigations i4 were 5 8 lower with two irrigations i2 grain yields decreased by 35 40 the additional water available in the higher irrigation treatments resulted in additional biomass production which increased actual evapotranspiration this result was also observed by irmak et al 2016 increasing maize grain yield with increased irrigation was also reported by farré and faci 2009 increasing the irrigation levels increased the evapotranspiration positively li and sun 2016 which was also positively correlated with the maize grain yield increase lenka et al 2009 both in this experiment and in the studies cited the maize grain yield increase was more prominent under dry season conditions where there is little or no in crop rainfall in zt maize for all irrigation treatments we observed reductions in bulk density of 2 3 and higher in the first year or comparable in the second year soil moisture content compared to ct maize fig 3 these results are in concordance with those observed by singh et al 2016 who observed a decrease in bulk density of 7 8 over five years in a zt rice maize system on a sandy loam soil compared to a ct baseline a zt rice maize system has a higher root mass density than a ct rice maize system singh et al 2016 and puddling increases soil compaction gathala et al 2011 thus the modest improvement in soil bulk density observed here after four crop cycles under zt is feasible previous studies have also demonstrated that retention of crop straw significantly reduces soil evaporation which also considerably increases the soil water storage perry 2011 huang et al 2005 thereby improving the crop water consumption the duration of the rice growing season which varied by variety significantly affected both rice grain yield and the productivity of the following maize crop table 3 in both experimental years heavy rainfall during rice grain filling resulted in lodging and yield losses across crop establishment methods ct and zt rice produced similar grain yields indicating that in the region of the eastern gangetic plain this zt direct seeded rice can replace ct management with no yield penalty for farmers similar comparable performances of ct and zt rice have been reported in south asia by sudhir yadav et al 2011 and bhushan et al 2007 in rice wheat systems kumar and ladha 2011 and gathala et al 2011 recorded higher grain yields in zt direct seeded rice than in ct rice in rice wheat systems in north western india they attributed discrepancies in rice yields to rainfall variability there were no significant grain yield differences between zt direct seeded rice and the ct rice baseline under any rainfall based irrigation strategy table 3 applying irrigation when less than 60 mm cumulative rainfall was received in either the preceding five or ten days produced slightly but not significantly higher yields than treatments where the irrigation threshold was 30 mm cumulative rainfall in the preceding five or ten days lodging during the rice grain filling period in both experimental years may have obscured more significant trends 4 2 apsim evaluation the apsim calibration and validation demonstrated that the model simulated well the biomass and grain yield of maize and rice crops and soil moisture in both zt and ct systems fig 2 and supplementary table 2 while acceptable agreement was achieved between observed and simulated data in both ct and zt rice observed rice grain yields were affected by lodging similar differences due to climatic factors were observed in wheat by asseng et al 2004 and bassu et al 2009 overall apsim slightly over estimated grain yield and biomass in both crops as the model does not account for the small productivity losses caused by pests weeds and disease in even well managed field trials apsim satisfactorily captured the difference in maize grain yield and biomass due to tillage differences and irrigation regimes similar model performance has been reported in south eastern australia pembleton et al 2013 and in the north china plains chen et al 2010 liu et al 2013 other studies in rice wheat systems e g peake et al 2014 mohanty et al 2012 were unable to accurately model observed production data this may have been a result of the model underestimating nitrogen uptake by the crop in this study nitrogen is non limiting apsim simulated well improved maize productivity under zt and accurately modelled improved soil water storage in the rice maize zt system as a result of altered soil physical and hydrological parameters fig 3 and supplementary tables 1 and 2 similar simulation results for maize productivity and soil water storage under different establishment methods were observed by yang et al 2018 in china the performance of apsim with a high degree of precision in rice based cropping systems when calibrated with location specific soil crop and management data has been reported by previous work laing et al 2018 gaydon et al 2012 2017 hochman et al 2017 poulton et al 2016 the good agreement between observed and simulated data in the independent second year validation dataset enables apsim to be used with confidence in long term scenario analysis gaydon et al 2017 hochman et al 2017 4 3 apsim scenarios productivity and water management simulation of the rice maize system over the longer term 49 years indicated that maize grain yields were consistently higher under zt than under ct grain yields were also higher when more irrigation was applied fig 4 there was no significant difference in zt maize grain yields between the i5 and i6 treatments zt maize with four irrigations i4 achieved similar or higher grain yields to ct maize with six irrigations i6 this suggests that irrigation frequency could be reduced by farmers in combination with zt crop establishment to reduce production costs without reducing grain yield the long term simulation results clearly indicated higher maize grain yields under zt when irrigation was limited and the crop water stressed zt leads to better crop resilience under adverse conditions than ct islam et al 2019 reported that in rice maize systems in farmers fields in the eastern gangetic plains uptake of zt crop establishment reduced irrigation water requirements by 8 27 2 compared to the water required by farmers in a ct rice maize system at higher irrigation levels i5 and i6 average zt maize grain yields were 11 2 11 3 t ha 1 this was 8 9 higher than average ct yields for the same irrigation treatments for these high irrigation treatments the maximum maize grain yields i e those achieved in less than 5 of years were slightly 0 14 0 46 t ha 1 higher under ct than under zt this is likely to be a result of well timed rainfall received during the maize growing period which provided additional water for crop evapotranspiration overall and particularly in relatively low yielding years maize grain yield under i5 and i6 was comparable variation 1 0 while under ct grain yields varied between 2 and 4 the apsim simulations demonstrated that zt improved soil water storage which resulted in higher extractable soil water esw than under ct contributing to higher maize grain yield supplementary fig 3 esw was higher in zt maize than in ct maize at each irrigation event as a result of improved soil water storage reduced soil evaporation and lower deep drainage losses for most of the predominantly rainfed rice growing season esw was higher under zt than under ct however at the end of the wet season esw was higher under ct due to poorer drainage i e lower ks values under ct rice than under zt direct seeded rice rice grain yields under zt direct seeded rice were higher than under ct rice across all years supplementary fig 2 these long term simulation data agree with longer term i e 5 year field studies in south asia which report higher rice grain yields under direct seeded rice in zt systems than in ct systems kumar et al 2018 jat et al 2014 gathala et al 2013 these results suggest that zt direct seeded rice can improve grain yields under both sufficient and deficit rainfall conditions 4 4 cost of production and gross margin analyses maize production while new to the eastern gangetic plains is attractive to farmers due to the potential for high crop productivity and reduced risk of terminal heat stress of maize compared to wheat within the eastern gangetic plains there is high and growing demand for maize for both human and animal consumption fao 2018 gathala et al 2016 pandey et al 2019 in order to maximize maize production under traditional ct practices farmers apply high inputs which is resource intensive and expensive gathala et al 2020b the cost of land preparation and sowing zt maize was five times lower than ct maize ct maize also required more labour table 4 and fig 5 the reduction in irrigation water applied under zt maize for a comparable yield to that achieved under ct maize directly decreased maize production costs the cost of agro chemicals was 3 5 higher under zt maize due to increased herbicide applied to control weeds however this increase was offset by reduction in required labor reduced by 35 40 and fuel reduced by 8 15 under zt each additional irrigation event incurred a cost over the previous irrigation event however there was little difference in total production costs or gross margins between i5 and i6 farmers baseline maize management was ct with six irrigations i6 comparable average yields could be achieved in a zt system with four irrigations i4 and higher yields in a zt system with five i5 or six i6 irrigations fig 5a consequently and accounting for higher irrigation costs zt maize with five or six irrigations i5 i6 resulted in gross margins which were significantly greater than the average gm of the baseline ct i6 system while the gm under zt maize with only three i3 or four i4 irrigations was considerably greater than the average gm of the ct i6 system fig 5d economic returns to the farmer per dollar spent on producing i e establishing growing and harvesting the maize crop were higher with increasing amount of irrigation and consistently higher under zt than under ct the greatest return per dollar spent under ct maize 1 3 for i6 was less than the least return per dollar spent under zt maize 1 39 for i2 table 4 in agreement with our findings lower fuel and labor requirements under zt than under ct in rice maize cropping systems have also been reported by other researchers in south asia e g gathala et al 2020a b 2013 jat et al 2014 saharawat et al 2010 as have lower production costs and higher gross margins under zt maize than under ct maize gathala et al 2020b 2011 singh et al 2016 laik et al 2014 jat et al 2013 this study did not consider the sensitivity of key economic variables such as labor cost or fuel price nor did it examine rice maize cropping systems under future climate variability and change further research into these areas as well as a consideration of an enabling policy environment to best support the uptake of zt technologies by risk averse smallholder farmers are recommended 5 conclusion experimental field trials in a rice maize system in bihar in the eastern gangetic plain demonstrated that comparable yields were achieved under zero tillage zt with lower irrigation than under conventional tillage ct with higher irrigation zt maize management resulted in higher plant available soil water thereby improving crop water use efficiency reducing production costs and leading to higher gross margins and a greater return per dollar spent than ct maize for all irrigation treatments examined we used the experimental field trial data to successfully calibrate and validate a rice maize cropping system in apsim our long term scenario analyses demonstrated that 1 zt maize was more productive than ct maize 2 zt direct seeded rice grain yields were comparable to or higher than ct rice grain yields and had lower yield variability 3 soils in zt systems had higher extractable soil moisture than those in ct systems and 4 a zt rice maize cropping system achieves grain maize yields with less irrigation reduced production costs and higher gross margins than in a ct rice maize system zt maize production was more water efficient and thus more fuel efficient than ct maize largely because zt crop establishment practices combined with residue retention improved the soil physical condition and increased the amount of water available to plants in the soil these increased production efficiencies lowered production costs and increased gross margins in zt maize the growing popularity in dry season maize production across the eastern gangetic plain combined with volatility in fuel prices means that zt rice maize systems will be attractive to farmers zt maize production was more advantageous than ct maize for all irrigation strategies examined and will help mitigate against fluctuating production costs the results of this research have broader applications across relatively low rainfall regions of the eastern gangetic plain including bihar more broadly parts of uttar pradesh and the nepali terai as well as globally in other low rainfall

10458,this is a brief review about irrigation scheduling tools and water management models for efficient on farm watering of vegetable crops under open field conditions this is the first step required for reducing water losses due to drainage and for minimizing the risk of underground water contamination in addition on farm water productivity can be optimized by employing several irrigation scheduling protocols and this review mainly focuses on commercial applications based on previous scientific findings new advancements in remote sensing technologies data processing and management offer opportunities for optimizing decision making in terms of watering regime particularly under the absence of water quality restrictions for reducing deep percolation of water it is important not only to properly determine the water requirements but also to tailor the frequency of irrigation to the soil characteristics and the growth of plant roots soil sensors are appropriate tools for achieving this goal and several technologies are available and compared by considering their advantages and drawbacks current knowledge on models for computing water requirement is also considered for an integrated irrigation scheduling that combines data from different sources from the soil plant atmosphere continuum the best irrigation technologies for on farm water application should be combined with irrigation scheduling programs based on the knowledge of soil characteristics and water requirements of local crops to minimize water contamination risks keywords crop water productivity decision support systems deficit irrigation irrigation scheduling nitrate leaching wireless sensor network 1 introduction contamination of water bodies due to excess nitrates is a serious and well known environmental problem which has been exacerbated in recent years by agriculture intensification thompson et al 2020 the need to externally apply water and nitrogen based fertilizers through fertigation has aggravated the problem of aquifer contamination one alarming scenario resulting from this is the example of the mar menor saltwater lagoon in the murcia region in south eastern spain guaita garcía et al 2020 in the surrounding areas open field vegetable production was intensified resulting in the collapse of the coastal marine ecosystem due to eutrophication although agriculture is not solely responsible for this situation one of the measures that was recently approved to combat this problem has been a regional law that requires growers in the area to improve their irrigation scheduling by using science driven approaches such as the use of soil water content sensors with their use being even compulsory for large plots borm 2019 in fact among many other causes irrigation is one the main drivers of nitrate leaching quemada et al 2013 and this is in part because irrigation scheduling decision making is still often and fundamentally tied to the local grower s experience the open field vegetable farming system is particularly prone to contaminating the surrounding water bodies this is because of the shallow root system of vegetable plants the high external nitrogen applications due to the high crop value high intensity of crop rotations accompanied by low crop diversification the rare use of leguminous species and the occurrence of difficult to predict extreme rainfall events in addition most open field vegetable crops have high requirements of water and nutrients because they are grown for harvest in the vegetative phase or at the early stage of the reproductive phase within these developmental stages plant growth leaf and root and associated growth physiology are exponentially correlated to growth factors such as water and nitrogen supply feller and fink 2002 their uptake and physiological conversion are in turn influenced by environmental factors which are not easy to control in the field varying environmental conditions and the need for sufficient water and nitrogen supplies until the date of harvest bears the risk of nutrient losses and of contaminating the surrounding water bodies one viable solution for dealing with this surmounting problem is to correctly manage water supplies through different approaches and technologies on the one hand irrigation technologies such as the adoption of ultra low flow discharge emitters and high frequency of irrigation can help minimize the risk of water leaching into underground waters vázquez et al 2006 other tools such as subsurface drip irrigation or the use of mulch can help reduce field water consumption by minimizing soil evaporation visconti et al 2019 nevertheless these strategies do not reduce the risk of water and nitrate leaching per se smart irrigation scheduling needs to be carried out in order to achieve optimum yield and efficiency in the use of water and to indeed optimize crop water productivity according to the definitions by fernández et al 2020 this implies determining the amount and frequency of irrigation to match water application to the water needs of the crop and the root zone water dynamics these aspects can be assessed mainly at two levels by considering the plot scale assuming a uniform water demand for a given plot and by taking into account potential in field variations particularly due to soil characteristics within a given plot this last aspect results in the development of precision irrigation technologies where watering scheduling is adapted to the local specificities monaghan et al 2013 while the potential advantage of precision irrigation for reducing deep percolation water losses has been determined from a theoretical point of view perea et al 2017 the current implementation of variable drip irrigation rates is still hampered by insufficient irrigation technologies that are able to deliver different watering regimes to small portions of the soil plot this review focuses on the use of currently available irrigation scheduling technologies and techniques that are ready to be implemented in the field to mitigate the challenge of reducing the contamination of water bodies due to excess nitrates there have been numerous studies that have investigated the possible efficient irrigation management protocols of vegetable production and horticulture in europe over the last decade massarutto 2003 viaggi et al 2010 pardossi and incrocci 2011 monaghan et al 2013 cahn and johnson 2017 in the present work we mostly focus on sensors and procedures that are already developed and in some cases incorporated into decision support systems dss for facilitating their use highlighting the advantages and technical reasons for some of their limitations this review may help to fill in the gap in knowledge between technological advancements and the status quo in irrigation vegetable crop management the tools reviewed can be mostly employed when a leaching fraction is negligible if water salinity levels are low and the potential crop water requirements can be fulfilled when water availability is a constraint deficit irrigation may need to be applied even if a high risk of yield loss exists singh et al 2019 therefore a simultaneous optimization of water and nutrient application are required under a deficit irrigation regime in order to reduce the risk of contaminating underground water bodies for managing irrigation scheduling under variable water quality levels readers are referred to the review by yasuor et al 2020 2 technologies and models for irrigation scheduling 2 1 new technologies and potential fields of application in open field vegetable production current research and development in irrigation management mainly focus on technological enhancements or adjustments of models and methods both areas aim to optimize the determination of the crops water demand as well as the crop s water productivity also an increasing number of studies are more strongly aligned with identifying the phenological stage specific or partial site specific irrigation demand e g chattaraj et al 2013 moghadas et al 2019 mouazen et al 2014 piccinni et al 2009 vanella et al 2019 the overarching challenge is to transform potentially complex and advanced approaches into user friendly irrigation management systems thus enabling their widespread use the rapid technological development especially in the field of informatics offers great opportunities for meeting these goals new technologies such as the internet of things iot cloud computing or artificial neuronal networks ann provide the required foundation needed for the use of multi parametric geospatial and real time based big data analysis of irrigation scheduling garcía et al 2020 these technologies may also meet the need for merging information from different sources thus providing the basis for decision making processes in irrigation nawandar and satpute 2019 ann may additionally enable decision making for complex environmental systems such as the water supply status of open field vegetable crops ann approaches however in contrast to mechanistic crop models do not necessarily explain the underlying connections between the crop and its environment which are the subject of the decision making process traditional approaches based on soil moisture sensors water balance or plant signals offer the possibility of becoming technically supported by cloud computing and iot generally iot connects physical objects things to the internet using a low power network connectivity that is embedded with sensors wireless sensor networks wsn are a prominent example of the application of iot in irrigation scheduling which connects soil moisture sensors to the internet muangprathub et al 2019 iot may strongly contribute to meeting the specific requirements of wsn for precision irrigation scheduling lea cox 2012 the availability of low cost microchips with radio microcontrollers enables the construction of radio controlled actuators and sensors which may foster the development of wsn beyond soil moisture sensors for sensor based irrigation management microcontroller platforms are a cost effective alternative to data loggers open source microcontroller boards e g arduino uno r3 www arduino cc have been integrated into systems for sensor based monitoring of soil moisture and automated irrigation control ferrarezi et al 2015 hassan et al 2019 a schematic diagram of an automated irrigation system is shown in fig 1 it can be described as being comprised of four units i acquisition ii microcontroller iii monitoring and iv automatic function soil moisture sensors e g capacitance sensors output the soil moisture depending on voltage which is registered by the microcontroller the microcontroller computes this input as measurement results according to the given code a dc power source e g provided by a battery powers the board the microcontroller controls the relay module to open or close the dc solenoid valve open valves release irrigation shown here as drip irrigation to enable monitoring of the irrigation system the microcontroller transfers the soil moisture levels and the status of the solenoid valves to a display lcd automated irrigation systems using microcontroller platforms can be set up with different numbers and types of sensors and valves or water pumps depending on the microcontroller in addition simple databases for initial estimates of crop water requirements can be stored in a data logger for drip irrigated field tomato the application of a custom built microcontroller coupled with a cheap capacitance sensor installed at 20 cm depth ech2o probe decagon devices inc pullman wash resulted in distinctive water savings while maintaining yield with respect to the typical fixed irrigation schedule rates applied by commercial tomato growers muñoz carpena et al 2008 in container trails a low cost open source microcontroller platform coupled to a capacitance sensor showed promising results over a range of irrigation thresholds ferrarezi et al 2015 more experience under field conditions with a large number of sensors and different sensor types is still needed however we believe that in the future simple irrigation controllers will be preferentially employed particularly if on farm precision irrigation develops further when taking into account the variation in soil characteristics and plant water needs within a field there will be the need to operate a larger amount of small irrigation sectors requiring the use of easy to use and cheaper controllers this can allow better adaptation of the entire farm irrigation scheduling to the farm variations in soil characteristics and topography which can potentially improve irrigation efficiency and reducing the risk of water loss through deep percolation this technological development is accompanied by the development of free and open source software foss for irrigation management lopez riquelme et al 2017 goap et al 2018 olberz et al 2018 piedelobo et al 2018 tsirogiannis et al 2018 while some software programs provide open access to the model s source code aquacrop os foster et al 2017 foss can also incorporate irrigation scheduling software irma sys tsirogiannis et al 2018 gsehen olberz et al 2018 olberz and zinkernagel 2019 geographic information systems gis hidromap piedelobo et al 2018 or cloud modules fiware lopez riquelme et al 2017 freely available earth observation data with high temporal resolution such as that provided by the optical imaging satellite sentinel 2b is the main source of information for gis based software currently only a few foss are available for irrigation scheduling of open field vegetables such as gsehen based on a crop s water balance its source code and basic data are provided to the public to be integrated into offerings from farm management information systems fmis providers this foss enables the technical integration of irrigation scheduling into irrigation management such as fleet management for irrigation machines other foss such as fiware focus on the reduction of inefficient irrigation supplies in the semiarid area in southern spain the number of commercial service providers of software based irrigation dss of agricultural and horticultural crops is increasing globally a large variety of vegetable crops which are grown on a small or medium scale may not easily increase the economic attractiveness of dss for information technologies companies or service providers hence the noticeable number of irrigation scheduling software programs has been developed predominately by public research institutes these science driven approaches provide the basis for commercial dss software and may promote the future availability of advanced irrigation scheduling tools this has motivated us to present the state of the art of models technologies and tools for irrigation scheduling of open field vegetable crops furthermore we address the tools and approaches used in open field vegetable production in northern and central europe 2 2 soils sensor tools and wireless sensor networks the irrigation technique is often the deciding factor when determining the irrigation scheduling approach the technique is in turn determined by water availability amongst many other on site and farm specific factors historically in northern and central europe the relatively low evaporative demand has been accompanied by a comparably high water availability for irrigation through precipitation filled water bodies and aquifers within the cultivation period however this may vary with climate change due to a higher irrigation demand and a higher susceptibility to drought conditions during the growing season e g schmidt and zinkernagel 2017 the former situation explains the current widespread use of overhead irrigation techniques such as sprinkler based irrigation still reliable data on the percentage of irrigated areas and irrigation techniques used are largely lacking in europe the sprinkler irrigation system is the predominant irrigation technique for asparagus in germany grown on more than 23 000 ha statista 2019 sprinklers have been utilized by 50 of the growers who use irrigation followed by drip irrigation 28 zinkernagel et al 2012a in a representative german vegetable production area 85 of the irrigated area is equipped with hose reel machines 12 with linear irrigation machines and 3 with drip irrigation berthold 2009 these techniques excluding drip irrigation usually imply unequal water distribution therefore timely measurements using soil moisture sensors do not accurately represent the water supply status of the entire crop their use is intended to provide an irrigation threshold and anticipate representative measuring points and it is restricted to conditions of uniform water distribution this is best achieved by drip irrigation still the use of drip irrigation in northern and central europe is still limited to crops with wide row spacing such as asparagus zucchini and strawberries despite this limitation soil moisture sensors have been widely accepted as irrigation scheduling devices by farmers providing an objective criterion of water demand at the root zone level of vegetable crops pardossi et al 2009 zinkernagel et al 2012a cahn and johnson 2017 2 2 1 soil moisture sensors types measuring principles and characteristics no other irrigation scheduling approaches have experienced as many recent commercial innovations as soil moisture sensors sms this development has been accompanied by an ever increasing evaluation of this approach by independent scientific research ferrazeri et al 2020 and references therein soil moisture sensors use different soil physical chemical and mechanical properties to obtain different types of data including electrical electromagnetic optical radiometric mechanical acoustic pneumatic or electrochemical measurements most of these measured variables provide the threshold for irrigation scheduling the upper values to initiate irrigation and for very responsive sensors the lower ones to stop irrigation the functioning of soil moisture sensors and their characteristics are well described hanson et al 2000 pardossi et al 2009 pardossi and incrocci 2011 and their assets and drawbacks of their operation are well known de pascale et al 2018 pardossi and incrocci 2011 thompson et al 2017 a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of the most commonly used sensors in research and in commercial vegetable production was created from publications that dealt with irrigation scheduling of open field vegetables table 1 there have been few studies on the evaluation of the sensors used in europe therefore we also consider sensors used in the usa which have been evaluated and published peer reviewed journals accuracy and correct placement are also important sensor characteristics cardenas lailhacar and dukes 2010 tested time domain transmissometry tdt type soil moisture sensors sdi 12 acclima meridian idaho usa granular matrix sensor watermark irrometer company riverside california usa and resistance sensors ms 100 rain bird glendora california usa that were commercially available in the usa as regards to their precision on measuring volumetric soil water content θ under field conditions most of the tested soil moisture sensors were defined as being imprecise based on the criterion of the proportion of bypassed scheduled irrigation events according to the variance for measuring θ tdt and resistance sensors performed best soulis et al 2015 showed that sms accuracy and positioning considerably affected irrigation efficiency defined as the ratio of the depth of irrigation water that is beneficially used by the plants to the depth of irrigation water applied in drip irrigation scheduling systems their simulation showed that the effect of sensor position varied according to the soil type drip line distance and discharge rate the sensors positioned directly under the emitters were linked to lower efficiency and positions deeper than 20 cm may lower the irrigation efficiency even lower positions reduced soil evaporation but also increased deep percolation due to higher θ in the lower part of the root zone and consequently increased irrigation frequency across all the cases the most suitable position also considering the sensors representativeness was 11 cm from the drip line and 10 cm below the soil surface in addition to defining the optimum irrigation frequency the sensors placement below the root zone fulfilled the need for monitoring soil water dynamics properly sensors located below the root zone often colloquially named drainage sensors should be used to ensure that water and contaminants are not drained 2 2 2 use and fields of applications in open field vegetable production the underlying measurement principle of sms determines their suitability and the requirements for their use in irrigation scheduling of vegetable crops cahn and johnson 2017 de pascale et al 2018 pardossi and incrocci 2011 pardossi et al 2009 thompson et al 2017 sensor requirements characteristics for open field vegetable crops and their potential use in wsn are summarized in table 2 the most important decisive factors for the choice and use of soil sensors are probably the needs for i practical applicability ii accuracy and reliability due to high susceptibility to insufficient water supply particularly within the context of high nutrient demand and the risk of nitrate leaching and iii user friendliness of sms networks when a farmer has to choose a sensor type the decision making process is heavily based on socio economic factors another more objective criteria in this process include i environmental factors such as soil type need for accuracy precipitation distribution and height ii crop factors such as et demand rooting depth and cultivation duration and iii irrigation technique its homogeneity and frequency of water distribution accordingly and iv water management based on these criteria potential fields of application are shown for different sensor types table 1 cahn and johnson 2017 demonstrated that sensor quality is determined by the representativeness of the respective soil water status threshold for indicating the water demand of plants tension based thresholds as provided by tensiometer and granular matrix sensors have been considered the best at determining whether a crop requires water based on the good correlation between yield and quality and soil matric potential tensiometers are further regarded as the most suitable for i drip irrigated ii short cycled iii drought susceptible or frequently irrigated species iv irrespective of the soil type granular matrix sensors are also suitable for crops that have a short cycle and are drip irrigated and additionally for crops that tolerate dry soil conditions and are grown in a fine soil in general smp sensors offer a low obstacle for use due to their lower costs within the volumetric water content vwc sensor types tdr time domain reflectometry sensors are considered unsuitable due to cable length issues obstacles for measuring depths 30 cm de pascale et al 2018 and for being too expensive for practical use farés and polyakov 2006 however some commercial providers offer wireless solutions that are used in northern and central europe capacitance sensors are the most assessed sensors for the purpose of irrigation scheduling and numerous soil specific calibration equations have been published e g ferrarezi et al 2020 by using site specific equations capacitance sensors offer the best conditions for precise irrigation and high irrigation water use efficiency also for soil textures where other sensor types have less reliability cardenas lailhacar and dukes 2010 zotarelli et al 2009 2011 ferrarezi et al 2020 among capacitance sensors fdr frequency domain reflectometry devices have low operational requirements exclusively soil specific calibration the obstacles for the practical use of fdr and other capacitance based sensors in open field vegetable production are mainly mechanical cultivation practices these are frequently used in open field vegetable cropping systems particularly in row crops and fields with short cycled crops and high crop rotation wireless sensor systems address this shortcoming and capacitance sensors have been well evaluated for wsn 2 2 3 wireless sensor networks for irrigation scheduling of open field vegetable crops wsn are the technical keys for automated data collection from many different sensors at the soil atmosphere and plant levels lea cox 2012 and pardossi et al 2009 have performed a comprehensive identification of the opportunities and requirements for integrating sensors into wsn for precision irrigation scheduling a summary of the most relevant requirements of sensors and wsn for open field vegetables is given in table 2 a few studies have been published about designing developing and testing of wsn for irrigation scheduling and irrigation control of vegetable crops so far kumar et al 2016 lopez riquelme et al 2009 mouazen et al 2014 pardossi et al 2009 kumar et al 2016 describe a wsn operating with tensiometers for automated irrigation scheduling of open field vegetables in india the system architecture is comprised of a soil moisture sensor level sensor controller global system for mobile communication gsm receiver transmitter solenoid valve water meter and pump soil moisture data is sent to the user through a mobile handset based on a gsm network and short message service for irrigation control this wsn architecture type is similar to commercially available ones and used for the irrigation scheduling of open field vegetable crops in northern and central europe further development and adaptation of commercially available wsn hardware and software have been done to meet the monitoring and control requirements for fresh vegetables cultivated in open fields in germany sander et al 2016 the wsn system has been designed to be operated with various soil moisture sensors and thus takes into account the varying crop specific requirements for mounting and measuring the depth of the sensor as well as the number and frequency of measuring events additional features are the compatibility with magnetic valves pressure sensors water meters and climate sensors the wsn also allow for leakage detection and system monitoring these specifications may thus contribute to a reduction of water and energy loss and the avoidance of nitrate leaching for site specific irrigation scheduling using wsn mouazen et al 2014 described a multi sensor platform and data fusion approach for the delineation of management zones based on the water holding capacity of the soil with ann and multiple linear regression suitable positions and the density of moisture sensors can be defined in order to optimize the amount and frequency of irrigation water needed to this end the integration of wsn into iot based irrigation management systems using ann may be a further development for precision and partial site specific irrigation scheduling moghadas et al 2019 goap et al 2018 describe a promising iot based irrigation management system with an algorithm that relies on the dynamic prediction of soil moisture and precipitation of the upcoming days generated by using machine learning techniques this takes into consideration the irrigation scheduling requirements of vegetables farms pertaining to small and medium sized plots as well as various crops with varying cultivation durations water demand and environmental conditions new advancements in iot and ann based irrigation systems may therefore offer technically feasible solutions for spatially and temporally differentiated irrigation strategies with all the benefits of ann in automated and precise irrigation scheduling it must be clear that the model approaches based on artificial intelligence restrict the understanding of the cause effect relationships between the soil the plant and the atmosphere furthermore since they are generated with sophisticated statistical methods such as multiple linear regression bootstrapping bayesian inference and ann they may only be of limited practical use 2 2 4 effectiveness for reducing drainage and nitrate leaching while maintaining yield for open field vegetable crops particularly grown in soils with a low water holding capacity and soil organic matter content their water productivity wp and nutrient use efficiency nue can be improved by a high frequency but low volume application of water locascio 2005 zotarelli et al 2009 2011 these improvements can occur if soil water status is maintained within an upper and lower limit according to the soil texture and rooting depth the ability of sms to measure this range accurately as well in real time therefore determines the extent of the crop s wp and nue an increase in crop wp with reduced nitrate leaching while maintaining yield was observed for drip irrigated open field vegetables scheduled with vwc thresholds using capacitance sensors with factory calibration zotarelli et al 2008 2009 balendonck et al 2010 zotarelli et al 2011 compared to treatments similar to grower irrigation management the irrigation scheduling with thresholds of 10 12 vwc using rs500 sms controller acclima usa reduced nitrate leaching in green bell pepper zucchini squash and tomato crops cultivated with plastic mulch in sandy soil up to 93 zotarelli et al 2008 2009 2011 under field conditions balendonck et al 2010 demonstrated that the use of a wsn based dss integrating the capacitive wet sensors delta t devices ltd uk successfully reduced nitrate leaching and increased crop water productivity without losses in yield and quality of iceberg lettuce when irrigation deficit was applied by dutch farms a meta analysis on agricultural crops showed that adjusting water application to crop needs reduced nitrate leaching by 78 relative to excess water supply without a reduction in crop yield quemada et al 2013 deficit irrigation and improved irrigation scheduling had a smaller effect however the greatest impact was achieved by improving water management the potential of soil sensor based reduction of nitrate leaching in northern and central europe may be further constrained by the limited use of drip irrigation and the vegetables grown the effects described above are mainly based on fruiting vegetables irrigated via drip irrigation and the application of deficit irrigation leafy vegetables have limited potential for reducing water supply more studies are needed on the effect of sensor based irrigation scheduling on sprinkler irrigation and on different sensor types at the farm level within the context of the european water framework directive however the state of knowledge on sensor based irrigation scheduling combined with efficient irrigation techniques offers a good background for the reduction of nitrate leaching in vegetable growing areas 2 2 5 tools for improving irrigation scheduling based on soil moisture sensors one of the major considerations when using sms is the number and location of sensors to obtain representative measurements of soil moisture in a given plot while these aspects depend on many characteristics related with the soil crop type and the irrigation system employed previous studies have often encountered a high variability in the soil moisture levels hendrickx and wierenga 1990 schmitz and sourell 2000 therefore to optimize sensor performance and placement mapping the spatial variation in soil properties in order to characterize zones with different soil types that could require different irrigation scheduling protocols and thresholds is recommended in this sense electromagnetic em sensors which are used for mapping of apparent soil salinity can be used to map zones of soil variability mouzen et al 2014 however it should be remembered that em sensors do not measure soil moisture content directly and measurements depend on soil salinity content of organic matter organic carbon clay and bulk density the recent development in em sensor technology and decreasing costs offer an additional potential for automated wireless irrigation hanson et al 2000 soulis et al 2015 and references therein em sensors may be an interesting prospect for sprinkler irrigated crops due to their relatively large volume of measurement hanson et al 2000 2 3 evaporative demand tools evaporative demand tools are often used complementary to sensors to estimate the water consumption of vegetable crops or at least the initial irrigation amount estimating the crop water requirements by calculating the daily crop water balance cwb is a well established stand alone approach for irrigation scheduling allen et al 1998 doorenbos et al 1977 the cwb is based on estimating crop evapotranspiration as determined by a reference evapotranspiration et0 and crop coefficients kc the et0 represents the potential evapotranspiration of a model surface or crop and the kc converts it to the crop specific et etc crop coefficients are calculated experimentally for different phenological crop stages by adjusting etc measured to an et0 model there are numerous models for calculating et0 and they mainly differ in the weighing of climate parameters and aerodynamic properties et0 models can be grouped into three types olberz et al 2018 i ambient temperature based thornthwaite et al 1957 ii radiation and temperature based hargreaves and samani 1985 and iii combination models that additionally contain aerodynamic properties penman 1948 allen et al 1998 the calculation of these models differs in the amount of time and effort involved local adjustment as well as the quantity and quality of data acquisition for precise et0 estimation olberz et al 2018 with the number of input variables the potential for errors in measurement and computing increase and cause cumulative errors in the et0 calculation meyer et al 1989 rahimikhoob et al 2012 computing et0 for irrigation scheduling refers to meteorological data from farmer owned weather stations or public and private weather services e g baroni et al 2019 cahn and johnson 2017 and references therein accurate measurements involving reasonable location maintenance and calibration and continuous data transmission of the meteorological parameters determine the reliability of cwb as a consequence statistically adjusted and less data demanding et0 models have been developed droogers and allen 2002 olberz et al 2018 and references therein the penman monteith equation modified by allen et al 1998 the fao 56 et0 is the most positively assessed et0 allen et al 2006 droogers and allen 2002 gavilán et al 2007 liu et al 2009 and has become the standard input required to be used in conjunction with kc values for crop irrigation scheduling allen et al 1998 doorenbos et al 1977 this approach has been shown to be simple convenient and reproducible for many crops in different climate conditions allen and pereira 2009 this may explain its widespread international use in irrigation scheduling of vegetable crops allen et al 1998 cahn and johnson 2017 pardossi and incrocci 2011 however kc represents a relative measurement of crop et and therefore each cwb model requires specifically parametrized and evaluated kc or et0 under local conditions allen et al 1998 elia and conversa 2015 guerra et al 2016 olberz et al 2018 allen et al 1998 describes two approaches

et al 2000 olberz et al 2018 zinkernagel 2019 and validated with white cabbage under four different climate conditions in germany krumbein and germanus 2014 in addition to climate soil cultivar

vegetation indices the advantage of dynamic models over static kc models such as fao 56 allen et al 1998 is to better adapt the amount and timing of irrigation to the actual water requirements

models also allow for automatic computation of irrigation scheduling some of these model approaches are applied in the dss available for open field vegetable crops mirás avalos et al 2019 giusti and marsili libelli 2015 bonfil et al 2004 elia and conversa 2015 a comprehensive review of the current dss available for irrigation scheduling is reported in gallardo et al 2020 model algorithms for advanced applications must be able to be integrated as well free and open source software foss may be the key for this a foss that defines the interfaces and provides the algorithm of the cwb model

of our knowledge gsehen based on geisenheimer irrigation scheduling is the first foss for vegetable crop irrigation scheduling available olberz and zinkernagel 2019 recently an algorithm for separately determining soil evaporation and plant transpiration was developed and tested in lettuce and watermelon in eastern spain mirás avalos et al 2019 this algorithm enables the individual consideration of two main components for water extraction within a vegetable field and better considers specificities in soil management such as the use of mulch the commercial exploitation of the routines has been licensed to a private company hispatec almería spain https www hispatec com and has been integrated into a more general enterprise resource planning software in addition to tools based on et estimates there are also methods based on et measurements the bowen ratio energy balance is a micrometeorological method used to determine the evaporative flux from the vegetation surface it has been widely used with short natural vegetation agricultural and vegetable crops to measure eta casa et al 2000 fernández 2014 grattan et al 1998 goyal et al 2013 scott et al 2003 teixeira et al 2007 zábranský et al 2015 this wide use is due to its simplicity and relatively low cost this technique provides continuous unattended measurements and requires no information about the aerodynamic characteristics of the surface of interest and it can even integrate latent heat fluxes over large areas todd et al 2000 grattan et al 1998 used the bowen ratio energy balance in california to relate crop coefficients to the fraction of vegetation cover fc for several open field vegetable crops they concluded that kc changed as a quadratic function of percentage ground cover fernández 2014 in south eastern spain presented a new vision based computer method for estimating kc obtained from the data provided by a bowen ratio station of lettuce crops based on digital photographs of the vegetation cover casa et al 2000 indicated that the bowen ratio technique generally only worked for short periods one growing season because of the difficulties associated with instrument maintenance and missing data however it can be successfully used in studies of seasonal crop water use there have also been recent developments in small lysimeters adapted to vegetable crops that are able to determine eta fronza and folegatti 2003 the possibility of combining the lysimeter output data originally conceived for an initial application in potted plants ruiz peñalver et al 2015 with irrigation scheduling recommendations is also now under development jiménez carvajal et al 2017 this application is still only used for research applications but its incorporation into electronic components is becoming more accessible as costs become cheaper we believe that this accessibility will increase in the near future as well as the potential use of lysimeters commercially as they could be used in a similar manner with complex multi depth soil sensors the successful implementation of this type of device will not only allow us to quantitatively determine et but also to collect drainage samples this would also be helpful in improving the frequency of irrigation and to determine the actual absolute values of nitrate leaching caution needs to be taken however when extrapolating the measurements carried out within the lysimeter soil and the surrounding fields particularly soil bulk density should be restored in the lysimeter after its installation as in the original field which is a difficult task to be conducted properly 2 4 remote sensing tools perhaps the most focused upon field of research in europe is on satellite or uav unmanned aircraft vehicle based sensing of crop water requirements alvino and marino 2017 and cahn and johnson 2017 provided an overview of remote sensing methods and systems for irrigation scheduling of horticultural and vegetable crops however a drawback of these methods is the frequent cloud formation in northern and central europe which constrains the usability of satellite based models the use of uavs may therefore be a promising technique for proximity and remote sensing of irrigation requirements to counter the cloud coverage dilemma for etc determination proximity and remote sensing techniques can be categorized into two approaches based on i vegetation indices vis and ii energy balance table 3 2 4 1 vegetation indices in recent decades several spectral vegetation indices vis have been introduced the use of spectral reflectance indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi has been proposed as a fast non destructive way of estimating crop growth capacity fortes et al 2015 the estimations for the fc derived from ndvi are highly relevant for a wide range of irrigation scheduling models cahn and johnson 2017 for irrigation scheduling there are several significant vi based approaches a good example of these are i the use of vis to evaluate the vegetation parameters such as fc and leaf area index lai amongst other variables glenn et al 2011 trout et al 2008 verger et al 2009 and ii the estimation of kc for etc calculation using a satellite derived vi calera et al 2017 er raki et al 2010 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 jayanthi et al 2007 kamble et al 2013 mateos et al 2013 torres sánchez et al 2015 kamble et al 2013 identified the accurate determination of kc using satellite derived vi curves for each crop in different climatic conditions as one of the most potent solutions for surface and underground water resources as well as for the optimization of their consumption in agriculture ramírez cuesta et al 2019 developed a gis tool box for computing ndvi maps of lettuce crops adjusting the tabulated fao kc according to the vegetation index obtained from sentinel ii images this allows taking into account the effect of local conditions on crop development which in the case of vegetable crops is highly dependent on the variety grown and the temperature regime the drawback for this approach as for any other remote sensing method is its limited use in the case of utilizing cover material such crop protection blankets or simple plastic tunnels courault et al 2008 focused on assessing the potential of formosat 2 data characterized by high spatial 8 m pixel and temporal resolutions 1 3 day time revisit to improve crop modelling and spatial estimation of the main land properties the results showed that the high temporal and spatial resolutions of these new remote sensing data could provide accurate surface parameters that lead to satisfactory flux simulations when used as input data in both land surface models tested jayanthi et al 2007 successfully estimated daily etc for potato using basal and canopy reflectance based kc in addition the spatial variability of actual crop water demand was detected using high resolution multispectral aerial imagery algorithms based on a triangle approach which is itself derived from 8 day modis ts and ndvi scatterplots were evaluated by garcia et al 2014 to estimate the surface water deficit in two sites with different climatic controls on eta in andalusia spain during different growth stages of the winter crops season the analyses showed that the quality of air temperature data had the most significant influence on the accuracy of the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi to estimate the surface water deficit torres sánchez et al 2015 used the object based image analysis obia which was applied to vegetation detection in remote sensed images captured with two sensors one sensor was a conventional visible light camera and the other sensor was a multispectral camera these sensors were mounted on an uav and data was collected over three different fields of herbaceous crops these tests assessed the performance of the obia algorithm for classifying vegetation coverage and how it was affected by different automatically selected thresholds calculated in the images of two vegetation indices the excess green and the ndvi campoy et al 2019 described the integration of a time series of ndvi based on satellite remote sensing into crop growth models for the estimation of the light and water use efficiencies in biomass production for garlic in south eastern spain caparrini and manzella 2009 presented the first estimations of meteorological and vis for an integrated system developed in the central region of tuscany italy this system incorporated the cross evaluation of the standardized precipitation index spi vis from remote sensing from modis and sevirimsg outputs from the distributed hydrological model mobidic and applied them in real time for water balance evaluation and hydrological forecast the results of this work have shown that neither the spi nor the vis alone can completely depict the severity of drought conditions the drought monitoring system will serve as a very valuable tool to support decision making in the management and evaluation of water resources once it is operational and improved 2 4 2 energy balance the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 2000 is one of the most widely known algorithms for the estimation of et using satellite images rahimi et al 2015 furthermore the sebal is widely used to compute etc this approach uses satellite data as an input and quantifies the energy balance by measuring visible near infrared and thermal radiation tasumi et al 2003 in addition to satellite images the sebal model requires weather parameters such as wind speed humidity solar radiation and air temperature the sebal is capable of estimating et from the latent heat flux without previous information about the soil crop and management conditions bastiaanssen et al 2005 it uses satellite data on surface temperature from thermal infrared bands and data on reflectance from visible near infrared and shortwave infrared bands the three primary biophysical variables required for the input of landsat images into sebal are i surface brightness temperature sbt and ii multi spectral remote sensing data vis nir and tir which allow for the mapping of surface albedo and iii ndvi the latent heat flux or et is computed using the satellite acquisition time as the residual of the energy balance courault et al 2008 however this method was shown to have several drawbacks it requires thermal infrared data which is not easily available in the frequency or resolution required to schedule irrigation of fields i e it relies on the presence of extreme soil temperature hot and cold or dry and wet pixels in the imagery these methods may under scale the true potential surface temperature range without the presence of high water use crops in the imagery under these conditions sebal may provide erroneous estimations gowda et al 2008 since sebal was designed to be applied in relatively small areas with sharp contrasts in temperature and albedo it may be difficult to utilize it at the continental scale van den hurk 2001 ramos et al 2009 established eta measurements using mebes surface energy balance in spanish for the ebro basin in north eastern spain the results showed that the remote sensing algorithm could provide accurate daily eta estimations as compared with lysimeter measurements of daily et values however the sensitivity of remote sensing techniques to crop conditions and the influence of climatic and meteorological conditions limits their application gobbo et al 2019 recommended that the sebal should be coupled with crop simulation models e g dssat to overcome its limited use during long cloudy periods and that its application should be based on satellite data with higher spatial and temporal resolutions however the effectiveness of the sebal over different geographical areas is still an open question in addition it is difficult to implement the sebal or any other energy balance approach in practical applications for irrigation scheduling but we believe that in the near future with advancements in computing techniques and iot applications a commercial solution will become available this section has described the various approaches methods and systems for irrigation scheduling in non limited conditions their suitability is determined by the diverse requirements of the cropping conditions of vegetables in an open field the field of application results from weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each system table 3 the selection of an appropriate irrigation scheduling system depends on various factors such as irrigation technique irrigation frequency crop architecture e g partial or full ground cover crop plot size soil climate conditions availability of data and communication infrastructure and demands on the accuracy in water use other than selecting the best method for a specific cultivation condition it must be taken into consideration that some approaches only deal with the time of water demand and do not provide any information on the water volume needed thus promising approaches such as remote sensing or soil moisture sensors have to meet the demand of a stand alone method de pascale et al 2018 for irrigation scheduling 2 4 3 plant water status indicators determining plant water status is theoretically the most scientifically sound approach for replacing plant water needs several excellent reviews have been published jones 2004 fernández 2014 damm et al 2018 which mainly focus on tree crops where more approaches could be used due to their woody structures initial research in vegetable crops has been focused on evaluating the usefulness of stem diameter variations for detecting plant water status gallardo et al 2006a 2006b this work focused on reporting the feasibility of using stem dendrometers depending on the crop type with the phenological period and the evaporative demand limiting the practical use for this tool sap flow sensors can be employed to trace transpiration and therefore determine both plant water use and the degree of water stress however soil evaporation will remain to be quantified with complementary tools and the absolute transpiration values that could be obtained might not properly represent the actual transpiration rates because of the many assumptions required to convert heat tracer signals to water flow flo et al 2019 in open field vegetable crops a review by pardossi and incrocci 2011 summarized the current methods available at that time and the practical commercial solutions and envisioned how canopy temperature determinations were going to play an important role at present plant water status sensing applications see table 3 for a brief summary of the solutions available are preferentially based on canopy reflectance data that can be monitored at different spatial and temporal resolution scales depending on the platform used damm et al 2018 the application of this type of technology in an automatic irrigation controller is however still hampered by the difficulty in interpreting the data obtained this is because plant water status is not only determined by the soil water available to the plant but also on several endogenous factors of the environment and the plant which are difficult to integrate damm et al 2018 3 irrigation management under water quantity constraints when water availability fails to meet a crop s requirements irrigation can be scheduled by partial root zone drying strategies jensen et al 2010 where only a limited volume of the root zone is wetted by the irrigation system alternatively irrigation can be reduced during the entire crop growing period deficit irrigation or only in those phenological stages in which yield is relatively less sensitive to soil water deficits regulated deficit irrigation rdi this last option was developed in the 1980s as a strategy to reduce vegetative growth of vigorous trees and to save water behboudian and mills 1997 there are important limitations of rdi for vegetable crops because their growth stages are not clearly defined or of sufficient duration during which water restrictions could be preferentially applied additionally vegetable crops are generally shallow rooted and rapidly experience the negative effects of irrigating at less than potential etc stanley and maynard 1990 this is particularly relevant for crops such as lettuce and other leafy vegetables which are normally grown for harvesting their entire biomass for instance capra et al 2008 found a significant decrease in lettuce production as et decreased in addition other vegetable crops where fruits are harvested such as pepper are also sensitive to water restrictions in fact a recent research study concluded that deficit irrigation detrimentally affected pepper yield regardless of the period in which water was restricted concluding that this practice was not well suited for sweet pepper abdelkhalik et al 2020 for watermelon under sustained deficit irrigation yield decreased linearly in response to an increase in water stress rouphael et al 2008 when the sensitivity of watermelon plants to water restrictions was analysed erdem and yuskel 2003 concluded that flowering was the most sensitive phenological stage to water restrictions in this sense the authors found that fruit ripening was the phenological period that was better suited for the application of deficit irrigation in view of the positive effects on fruit quality therefore the possible practical implementation of any deficit irrigation program should be restricted to vegetable crops with generative organs such as melon and tomato where some water deficit applied only late in the season could help increase the fruit s soluble solids content abdelkhalik et al 2019 lu et al 2019 or specific metabolites such as lycopene and other bioactive compounds in the case of tomato fruit klunklin and savage 2017 despite the potential negative effect of rdi on vegetable crops we expect that in the near future as water scarcity and its price increase rdi could occasionally be employed as a strategy to maximize economic benefits considering not only the crop water requirements and the water use efficiency but an integrated cost benefit analysis as well fernández et al 2020 the use of rdi will also have implications for fertilization management and it is necessary to better tailor it to the water stress and its impacts on carbon partitioning on plant nutrient requirements this requires further study and a more holistic approach where both water and nitrogen use efficiency are jointly assessed this has already been investigated in field crops quemada and gabriel 2016 however there have also been attempts with potato badr et al 2012 as well as tomato du et al 2018 in general while increasing the nitrogen rate and thus the risk of nitrate leaching has positive effects on water productivity nitrogen use efficiency is optimized at intermediate nitrogen levels particularly when deficit irrigation is applied du et al 2018 4 conclusion and future perspectives this review has analysed several options for optimizing crop water productivity in open field vegetable crops while reducing water body contaminations and encompasses many recent works published in this field in terms of irrigation scheduling the focus was to analyse the advantages and limitations of existing approaches summarizing the main commercial applications already available for use in commercial situations technologies and approaches were assessed in terms of their potential to overcome water scarcity caused by climate change and the need to protect soil and groundwater while maintaining yield and product quality due to the increasing pressure on water resources from other economic activities irrigation of vegetable crops will have to be adapted to ensure an appropriate sub optimal plant water status in addition the potential applications of predicting water status beyond irrigation control have yet to be fully exploited predicting the short term and seasonal water status can be integrated into dss for managing additional irrigation practices to also determine the plant s water status more mechanistic research is needed to be able to incorporate the water status prediction models into decision support tools for drought and salinity stress monitoring new approaches in irrigation management should lead to an improvement in water management at the field level additionally the development of accurate irrigation scheduling calibrated to function under local conditions is a key component in the sustainability of irrigation the application of remote sensing technology in the last decade has led to significant advancements and improvements in irrigation management in the coming years the advancements in satellite based irrigation techniques should be utilized more extensively in a broader variety of conditions this will not only advance research in this field but will also improve the practical application of this approach coupling plant based models with remote sensing applications could be then employed to increase the spatial representation of the specific water status estimations current information technologies sebal webgis uav and smartphones support local farmers by easing the flow of information regarding the optimization of irrigation advice this is conducted in a user friendly medium allowing for the timely delivery of information the new remote sensing advancements summarized in this review should result in an easy integration of both specific measurements and model estimations on the ground to the entire field or even at the irrigation district level in the future user friendly techniques should be more extensively applied and farmers should be able to use scientific scheduling irrigation methods to be able to minimize water contamination risks due to inefficient irrigation the best irrigation technologies for water delivery off and on farm should be combined with irrigation scheduling programs based on the knowledge of soil characteristics and the water requirements of local crops the recent new developments for inexpensive and simple irrigation controllers could be used to differentially irrigated

10458,this is a brief review about irrigation scheduling tools and water management models for efficient on farm watering of vegetable crops under open field conditions this is the first step required for reducing water losses due to drainage and for minimizing the risk of underground water contamination in addition on farm water productivity can be optimized by employing several irrigation scheduling protocols and this review mainly focuses on commercial applications based on previous scientific findings new advancements in remote sensing technologies data processing and management offer opportunities for optimizing decision making in terms of watering regime particularly under the absence of water quality restrictions for reducing deep percolation of water it is important not only to properly determine the water requirements but also to tailor the frequency of irrigation to the soil characteristics and the growth of plant roots soil sensors are appropriate tools for achieving this goal and several technologies are available and compared by considering their advantages and drawbacks current knowledge on models for computing water requirement is also considered for an integrated irrigation scheduling that combines data from different sources from the soil plant atmosphere continuum the best irrigation technologies for on farm water application should be combined with irrigation scheduling programs based on the knowledge of soil characteristics and water requirements of local crops to minimize water contamination risks keywords crop water productivity decision support systems deficit irrigation irrigation scheduling nitrate leaching wireless sensor network 1 introduction contamination of water bodies due to excess nitrates is a serious and well known environmental problem which has been exacerbated in recent years by agriculture intensification thompson et al 2020 the need to externally apply water and nitrogen based fertilizers through fertigation has aggravated the problem of aquifer contamination one alarming scenario resulting from this is the example of the mar menor saltwater lagoon in the murcia region in south eastern spain guaita garcía et al 2020 in the surrounding areas open field vegetable production was intensified resulting in the collapse of the coastal marine ecosystem due to eutrophication although agriculture is not solely responsible for this situation one of the measures that was recently approved to combat this problem has been a regional law that requires growers in the area to improve their irrigation scheduling by using science driven approaches such as the use of soil water content sensors with their use being even compulsory for large plots borm 2019 in fact among many other causes irrigation is one the main drivers of nitrate leaching quemada et al 2013 and this is in part because irrigation scheduling decision making is still often and fundamentally tied to the local grower s experience the open field vegetable farming system is particularly prone to contaminating the surrounding water bodies this is because of the shallow root system of vegetable plants the high external nitrogen applications due to the high crop value high intensity of crop rotations accompanied by low crop diversification the rare use of leguminous species and the occurrence of difficult to predict extreme rainfall events in addition most open field vegetable crops have high requirements of water and nutrients because they are grown for harvest in the vegetative phase or at the early stage of the reproductive phase within these developmental stages plant growth leaf and root and associated growth physiology are exponentially correlated to growth factors such as water and nitrogen supply feller and fink 2002 their uptake and physiological conversion are in turn influenced by environmental factors which are not easy to control in the field varying environmental conditions and the need for sufficient water and nitrogen supplies until the date of harvest bears the risk of nutrient losses and of contaminating the surrounding water bodies one viable solution for dealing with this surmounting problem is to correctly manage water supplies through different approaches and technologies on the one hand irrigation technologies such as the adoption of ultra low flow discharge emitters and high frequency of irrigation can help minimize the risk of water leaching into underground waters vázquez et al 2006 other tools such as subsurface drip irrigation or the use of mulch can help reduce field water consumption by minimizing soil evaporation visconti et al 2019 nevertheless these strategies do not reduce the risk of water and nitrate leaching per se smart irrigation scheduling needs to be carried out in order to achieve optimum yield and efficiency in the use of water and to indeed optimize crop water productivity according to the definitions by fernández et al 2020 this implies determining the amount and frequency of irrigation to match water application to the water needs of the crop and the root zone water dynamics these aspects can be assessed mainly at two levels by considering the plot scale assuming a uniform water demand for a given plot and by taking into account potential in field variations particularly due to soil characteristics within a given plot this last aspect results in the development of precision irrigation technologies where watering scheduling is adapted to the local specificities monaghan et al 2013 while the potential advantage of precision irrigation for reducing deep percolation water losses has been determined from a theoretical point of view perea et al 2017 the current implementation of variable drip irrigation rates is still hampered by insufficient irrigation technologies that are able to deliver different watering regimes to small portions of the soil plot this review focuses on the use of currently available irrigation scheduling technologies and techniques that are ready to be implemented in the field to mitigate the challenge of reducing the contamination of water bodies due to excess nitrates there have been numerous studies that have investigated the possible efficient irrigation management protocols of vegetable production and horticulture in europe over the last decade massarutto 2003 viaggi et al 2010 pardossi and incrocci 2011 monaghan et al 2013 cahn and johnson 2017 in the present work we mostly focus on sensors and procedures that are already developed and in some cases incorporated into decision support systems dss for facilitating their use highlighting the advantages and technical reasons for some of their limitations this review may help to fill in the gap in knowledge between technological advancements and the status quo in irrigation vegetable crop management the tools reviewed can be mostly employed when a leaching fraction is negligible if water salinity levels are low and the potential crop water requirements can be fulfilled when water availability is a constraint deficit irrigation may need to be applied even if a high risk of yield loss exists singh et al 2019 therefore a simultaneous optimization of water and nutrient application are required under a deficit irrigation regime in order to reduce the risk of contaminating underground water bodies for managing irrigation scheduling under variable water quality levels readers are referred to the review by yasuor et al 2020 2 technologies and models for irrigation scheduling 2 1 new technologies and potential fields of application in open field vegetable production current research and development in irrigation management mainly focus on technological enhancements or adjustments of models and methods both areas aim to optimize the determination of the crops water demand as well as the crop s water productivity also an increasing number of studies are more strongly aligned with identifying the phenological stage specific or partial site specific irrigation demand e g chattaraj et al 2013 moghadas et al 2019 mouazen et al 2014 piccinni et al 2009 vanella et al 2019 the overarching challenge is to transform potentially complex and advanced approaches into user friendly irrigation management systems thus enabling their widespread use the rapid technological development especially in the field of informatics offers great opportunities for meeting these goals new technologies such as the internet of things iot cloud computing or artificial neuronal networks ann provide the required foundation needed for the use of multi parametric geospatial and real time based big data analysis of irrigation scheduling garcía et al 2020 these technologies may also meet the need for merging information from different sources thus providing the basis for decision making processes in irrigation nawandar and satpute 2019 ann may additionally enable decision making for complex environmental systems such as the water supply status of open field vegetable crops ann approaches however in contrast to mechanistic crop models do not necessarily explain the underlying connections between the crop and its environment which are the subject of the decision making process traditional approaches based on soil moisture sensors water balance or plant signals offer the possibility of becoming technically supported by cloud computing and iot generally iot connects physical objects things to the internet using a low power network connectivity that is embedded with sensors wireless sensor networks wsn are a prominent example of the application of iot in irrigation scheduling which connects soil moisture sensors to the internet muangprathub et al 2019 iot may strongly contribute to meeting the specific requirements of wsn for precision irrigation scheduling lea cox 2012 the availability of low cost microchips with radio microcontrollers enables the construction of radio controlled actuators and sensors which may foster the development of wsn beyond soil moisture sensors for sensor based irrigation management microcontroller platforms are a cost effective alternative to data loggers open source microcontroller boards e g arduino uno r3 www arduino cc have been integrated into systems for sensor based monitoring of soil moisture and automated irrigation control ferrarezi et al 2015 hassan et al 2019 a schematic diagram of an automated irrigation system is shown in fig 1 it can be described as being comprised of four units i acquisition ii microcontroller iii monitoring and iv automatic function soil moisture sensors e g capacitance sensors output the soil moisture depending on voltage which is registered by the microcontroller the microcontroller computes this input as measurement results according to the given code a dc power source e g provided by a battery powers the board the microcontroller controls the relay module to open or close the dc solenoid valve open valves release irrigation shown here as drip irrigation to enable monitoring of the irrigation system the microcontroller transfers the soil moisture levels and the status of the solenoid valves to a display lcd automated irrigation systems using microcontroller platforms can be set up with different numbers and types of sensors and valves or water pumps depending on the microcontroller in addition simple databases for initial estimates of crop water requirements can be stored in a data logger for drip irrigated field tomato the application of a custom built microcontroller coupled with a cheap capacitance sensor installed at 20 cm depth ech2o probe decagon devices inc pullman wash resulted in distinctive water savings while maintaining yield with respect to the typical fixed irrigation schedule rates applied by commercial tomato growers muñoz carpena et al 2008 in container trails a low cost open source microcontroller platform coupled to a capacitance sensor showed promising results over a range of irrigation thresholds ferrarezi et al 2015 more experience under field conditions with a large number of sensors and different sensor types is still needed however we believe that in the future simple irrigation controllers will be preferentially employed particularly if on farm precision irrigation develops further when taking into account the variation in soil characteristics and plant water needs within a field there will be the need to operate a larger amount of small irrigation sectors requiring the use of easy to use and cheaper controllers this can allow better adaptation of the entire farm irrigation scheduling to the farm variations in soil characteristics and topography which can potentially improve irrigation efficiency and reducing the risk of water loss through deep percolation this technological development is accompanied by the development of free and open source software foss for irrigation management lopez riquelme et al 2017 goap et al 2018 olberz et al 2018 piedelobo et al 2018 tsirogiannis et al 2018 while some software programs provide open access to the model s source

imaging satellite sentinel 2b is the main source of information for gis based software currently only a few foss are available for irrigation scheduling of open field vegetables such as gsehen based on a crop s water balance its source code and basic data are provided to the public to be integrated into offerings from farm management information systems fmis providers this foss enables the technical integration of irrigation scheduling into irrigation management such as fleet management for irrigation machines other foss such as fiware focus on the reduction of inefficient irrigation supplies in the semiarid area in southern spain the number of commercial service providers of software based irrigation dss of agricultural and horticultural crops is increasing globally a large variety of vegetable crops which are grown on a small or medium scale may not easily increase the economic attractiveness of dss for information technologies companies or service providers hence the noticeable number of irrigation scheduling software programs has been developed predominately by public research institutes these science driven approaches provide the basis for commercial dss software and may promote the future availability of advanced irrigation scheduling tools this has motivated us to present the state of the art of models technologies and tools for irrigation scheduling of open field vegetable crops furthermore we address the tools and approaches used in open field vegetable production in northern and central europe 2 2 soils sensor tools and wireless sensor networks the irrigation technique is often the deciding factor when determining the irrigation scheduling approach the technique is in turn determined by water availability amongst many other on site and farm specific factors historically in northern and central europe the relatively low evaporative demand has been accompanied by a comparably high water availability for irrigation through precipitation filled water bodies and aquifers within the cultivation period however this may vary with climate change due to a higher irrigation demand and a higher susceptibility to drought conditions during the growing season e g schmidt and zinkernagel 2017 the former situation explains the current widespread use of overhead irrigation techniques such as sprinkler based irrigation still reliable data on the percentage of irrigated areas and irrigation techniques used are largely lacking in europe the sprinkler irrigation system is the predominant irrigation technique for asparagus in germany grown on more than 23 000 ha statista 2019 sprinklers have been utilized by 50 of the growers who use irrigation followed by drip irrigation 28 zinkernagel et al 2012a in a representative german vegetable production area 85 of the irrigated area is equipped with hose reel machines 12 with linear irrigation machines and 3 with drip irrigation berthold 2009 these techniques excluding drip irrigation usually imply unequal water distribution therefore timely measurements using soil moisture sensors do not accurately represent the water supply status of the entire crop their use is intended to provide an irrigation threshold and anticipate representative measuring points and it is restricted to conditions of uniform water distribution this is best achieved by drip irrigation still the use of drip irrigation in northern and central europe is still limited to crops with wide row spacing such as asparagus zucchini and strawberries despite this limitation soil moisture sensors have been widely accepted as irrigation scheduling devices by farmers providing an objective criterion of water demand at the root zone level of vegetable crops pardossi et al 2009 zinkernagel et al 2012a cahn and johnson 2017 2 2 1 soil moisture sensors types measuring principles and characteristics no other irrigation scheduling approaches have experienced as many recent commercial innovations as soil moisture sensors sms this development has been accompanied by an ever increasing evaluation of this approach by independent scientific research ferrazeri et al 2020 and references therein soil moisture sensors use different soil physical chemical and mechanical properties to obtain different types of data including electrical electromagnetic optical radiometric mechanical acoustic pneumatic or electrochemical measurements most of these measured variables provide the threshold for irrigation scheduling the upper values to initiate irrigation and for very responsive sensors the lower ones to stop irrigation the functioning of soil moisture sensors and their characteristics are well described hanson et al 2000 pardossi et al 2009 pardossi and incrocci 2011 and their assets and drawbacks of their operation are well known de pascale et al 2018 pardossi and incrocci 2011 thompson et al 2017 a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of the most commonly used sensors in research and in commercial vegetable production was created from publications that dealt with irrigation scheduling of open field vegetables table 1 there have been few studies on the evaluation of the sensors used in europe therefore we also consider sensors used in the usa which have been evaluated and published peer reviewed journals accuracy and correct placement are also important sensor characteristics cardenas lailhacar and dukes 2010 tested time domain transmissometry tdt type soil moisture sensors sdi 12 acclima meridian idaho usa granular matrix sensor watermark irrometer company riverside california usa and resistance sensors ms 100 rain bird glendora california usa that were commercially available in the usa as regards to their precision on measuring volumetric soil water content θ under field conditions most of the tested soil moisture sensors were defined as being imprecise based on the criterion of the proportion of bypassed scheduled irrigation events according to the variance for measuring θ tdt and resistance sensors performed best soulis et al 2015 showed that sms accuracy and positioning considerably affected irrigation efficiency defined as the ratio of the depth of irrigation water that is beneficially used by the plants to the depth of irrigation water applied in drip irrigation scheduling systems their simulation showed that the effect of sensor position varied according to the soil type drip line distance and discharge rate the sensors positioned directly under the emitters were linked to lower efficiency and positions deeper than 20 cm may lower the irrigation efficiency even lower positions reduced soil evaporation but also increased deep percolation due to higher θ in the lower part of the root zone and consequently increased irrigation frequency across all the cases the most suitable position also considering the sensors representativeness was 11 cm from the drip line and 10 cm below the soil surface in addition to defining the optimum irrigation frequency the sensors placement below the root zone fulfilled the need for monitoring soil water dynamics properly sensors located below the root zone often colloquially named drainage sensors should be used to ensure that water and contaminants are not drained 2 2 2 use and fields of applications in open field vegetable production the underlying measurement principle of sms determines their suitability and the requirements for their use in irrigation scheduling of vegetable crops cahn and johnson 2017 de pascale et al 2018 pardossi and incrocci 2011 pardossi et al 2009 thompson et al 2017 sensor requirements characteristics for open field vegetable crops and their potential use in wsn are summarized in table 2 the most important decisive factors for the choice and use of soil sensors are probably the needs for i practical applicability ii accuracy and reliability due to high susceptibility to insufficient water supply particularly within the context of high nutrient demand and the risk of nitrate leaching and iii user friendliness of sms networks when a farmer has to choose a sensor type the decision making process is heavily based on socio economic factors another more objective criteria in this process include i environmental factors such as soil type need for accuracy precipitation distribution and height ii crop factors such as et demand rooting depth and cultivation duration and iii irrigation technique its homogeneity and frequency of water distribution accordingly and iv water management based on these criteria potential fields of application are shown for different sensor types table 1 cahn and johnson 2017 demonstrated that sensor quality is determined by the representativeness of the respective soil water status threshold for indicating the water demand of plants tension based thresholds as provided by tensiometer and granular matrix sensors have been considered the best at determining whether a crop requires water based on the good correlation between yield and quality and soil matric potential tensiometers are further regarded as the most suitable for i drip irrigated ii short cycled iii drought susceptible or frequently irrigated species iv irrespective of the soil type granular matrix sensors are also suitable for crops that have a short cycle and are drip irrigated and additionally for crops that tolerate dry soil conditions and are grown in a fine soil in general smp sensors offer a low obstacle for use due to their lower costs within the volumetric water content vwc sensor types tdr time domain reflectometry sensors are considered unsuitable due to cable length issues obstacles for measuring depths 30 cm de pascale et al 2018 and for being too expensive for practical use farés and polyakov 2006 however some commercial providers offer wireless solutions that are used in northern and central europe capacitance sensors are the most assessed sensors for the purpose of irrigation scheduling and numerous soil specific calibration equations have been published e g ferrarezi et al 2020 by using site specific equations capacitance sensors offer the best conditions for precise irrigation and high irrigation water use efficiency also for soil textures where other sensor types have less reliability cardenas lailhacar and dukes 2010 zotarelli et al 2009 2011 ferrarezi et al 2020 among capacitance sensors fdr frequency domain reflectometry devices have low operational requirements exclusively soil specific calibration the obstacles for the practical use of fdr and other capacitance based sensors in open field vegetable production are mainly mechanical cultivation practices these are frequently used in open field vegetable cropping systems particularly in row crops and fields with short cycled crops and high crop rotation wireless sensor systems address this shortcoming and capacitance sensors have been well evaluated for wsn 2 2 3 wireless sensor networks for irrigation scheduling of open field vegetable crops wsn are the technical keys for automated data collection from many different sensors at the soil atmosphere and plant levels lea cox 2012 and pardossi et al 2009 have performed a comprehensive identification of the opportunities and requirements for integrating sensors into wsn for precision irrigation scheduling a summary of the most relevant requirements of sensors and wsn for open field vegetables is given in table 2 a few studies have been published about designing developing and testing of wsn for irrigation scheduling and irrigation control of vegetable crops so far kumar et al 2016 lopez riquelme et al 2009 mouazen et al 2014 pardossi et al 2009 kumar et al 2016 describe a wsn operating with tensiometers for automated irrigation scheduling of open field vegetables in india the system architecture is comprised of a soil moisture sensor level sensor controller global system for mobile communication gsm receiver transmitter solenoid valve water meter and pump soil moisture data is sent to the user through a mobile handset based on a gsm network and short message service for irrigation control this wsn architecture type is similar to commercially available ones and used for the irrigation scheduling of open field vegetable crops in northern and central europe further development and adaptation of commercially available wsn hardware and software have been done to meet the monitoring and control requirements for fresh vegetables cultivated in open fields in germany sander et al 2016 the wsn system has been designed to be operated with various soil moisture sensors and thus takes into account the varying crop specific requirements for mounting and measuring the depth of the sensor as well as the number and frequency of measuring events additional features are the compatibility with magnetic valves pressure sensors water meters and climate sensors the wsn also allow for leakage detection and system monitoring these specifications may thus contribute to a reduction of water and energy loss and the avoidance of nitrate leaching for site specific irrigation scheduling using wsn mouazen et al 2014 described a multi sensor platform and data fusion approach for the delineation of management zones based on the water holding capacity of the soil with ann and multiple linear regression suitable positions and the density of moisture sensors can be defined in order to optimize the amount and frequency of irrigation water needed to this end the integration of wsn into iot based irrigation management systems using ann may be a further development for precision and partial site specific irrigation scheduling moghadas et al 2019 goap et al 2018 describe a promising iot based irrigation management system with an algorithm that relies on the dynamic prediction of soil moisture and precipitation of the upcoming days generated by using machine learning techniques this takes into consideration the irrigation scheduling requirements of vegetables farms pertaining to small and medium sized plots as well as various crops with varying cultivation durations water demand and environmental conditions new advancements in iot and ann based irrigation systems may therefore offer technically feasible solutions for spatially and temporally differentiated irrigation strategies with all the benefits of ann in automated and precise irrigation scheduling it must be clear that the model approaches based on artificial intelligence restrict the understanding of the cause effect relationships between the soil the plant and the atmosphere furthermore since they are generated with sophisticated statistical methods such as multiple linear regression bootstrapping bayesian inference and ann they may only be of limited practical use 2 2 4 effectiveness for reducing drainage and nitrate leaching while maintaining yield for open field vegetable crops particularly grown in soils with a low water holding capacity and soil organic matter content their water productivity wp and nutrient use efficiency nue can be improved by a high frequency but low volume application of water locascio 2005 zotarelli et al 2009 2011 these improvements can occur if soil water status is maintained within an upper and lower limit according to the soil texture and rooting depth the ability of sms to measure this range accurately as well in real time therefore determines the extent of the crop s wp and nue an increase in crop wp with reduced nitrate leaching while maintaining yield was observed for drip irrigated open field vegetables scheduled with vwc thresholds using capacitance sensors with factory calibration zotarelli et al 2008 2009 balendonck et al 2010 zotarelli et al 2011 compared to treatments similar to grower irrigation management the irrigation scheduling with thresholds of 10 12 vwc using rs500 sms controller acclima usa reduced nitrate leaching in green bell pepper zucchini squash and tomato crops cultivated with plastic mulch in sandy soil up to 93 zotarelli et al 2008 2009 2011 under field conditions balendonck et al 2010 demonstrated that the use of a wsn based dss integrating the capacitive wet sensors delta t devices ltd uk successfully reduced nitrate leaching and increased crop water productivity without losses in yield and quality of iceberg lettuce when irrigation deficit was applied by dutch farms a meta analysis on agricultural crops showed that adjusting water application to crop needs reduced nitrate leaching by 78 relative to excess water supply without a reduction in crop yield quemada et al 2013 deficit irrigation and improved irrigation scheduling had a smaller effect however the greatest impact was achieved by improving water management the potential of soil sensor based reduction of nitrate leaching in northern and central europe may be further constrained by the limited use of drip irrigation and the vegetables grown the effects described above are mainly based on fruiting vegetables irrigated via drip irrigation and the application of deficit irrigation leafy vegetables have limited potential for reducing water supply more studies are needed on the effect of sensor based irrigation scheduling on sprinkler irrigation and on different sensor types at the farm level within the context of the european water framework directive however the state of knowledge on sensor based irrigation scheduling combined with efficient irrigation techniques offers a good background for the reduction of nitrate leaching in vegetable growing areas 2 2 5 tools for improving irrigation scheduling based on soil moisture sensors one of the major considerations when using sms is the number and location of sensors to obtain representative measurements of soil moisture in a given plot while these aspects depend on many characteristics related with the soil crop type and the irrigation system employed previous studies have often encountered a high variability in the soil moisture levels hendrickx and wierenga 1990 schmitz and sourell 2000 therefore to optimize sensor performance and placement mapping the spatial variation in soil properties in order to characterize zones with different soil types that could require different irrigation scheduling protocols and thresholds is recommended in this sense electromagnetic em sensors which are used for mapping of apparent soil salinity can be used to map zones of soil variability mouzen et al 2014 however it should be remembered that em sensors do not measure soil moisture content directly and measurements depend on soil salinity content of organic matter organic carbon clay and bulk density the recent development in em sensor technology and decreasing costs offer an additional potential for automated wireless irrigation hanson et al 2000 soulis et al 2015 and references therein em sensors may be an interesting prospect for sprinkler irrigated crops due to their relatively large volume of measurement hanson et al 2000 2 3 evaporative demand tools evaporative demand tools are often used complementary to sensors to estimate the water consumption of vegetable crops or at least the initial irrigation amount estimating the crop water requirements by calculating the daily crop water balance cwb is a well established stand alone approach for irrigation scheduling allen et al 1998 doorenbos et al 1977 the cwb is based on estimating crop evapotranspiration as determined by a reference evapotranspiration et0 and crop coefficients kc the et0 represents the potential evapotranspiration of a model surface or crop and the kc converts it to the crop specific et etc crop coefficients are calculated experimentally for different phenological crop stages by adjusting etc measured to an et0 model there are numerous models for calculating et0 and they mainly differ in the weighing of climate parameters and aerodynamic properties et0 models can be grouped into three types olberz et al 2018 i ambient temperature based thornthwaite et al 1957 ii radiation and temperature based hargreaves and samani 1985 and iii combination models that additionally contain aerodynamic properties penman 1948 allen et al 1998 the calculation of these models differs in the amount of time and effort involved local adjustment as well as the quantity and quality of data acquisition for precise et0 estimation olberz et al 2018 with the number of input variables the potential for errors in measurement and computing increase and cause cumulative errors in the et0 calculation meyer et al 1989 rahimikhoob et al 2012 computing et0 for irrigation scheduling refers to meteorological data from farmer owned weather stations or public and private weather services e g baroni et al 2019 cahn and johnson 2017 and references therein accurate measurements involving reasonable location maintenance and calibration and continuous data transmission of the meteorological parameters determine the reliability of cwb as a consequence statistically adjusted and less data demanding et0 models have been developed droogers and allen 2002 olberz et al 2018 and references therein the penman monteith equation modified by allen et al 1998 the fao 56 et0 is the most positively assessed et0 allen et al 2006 droogers and allen 2002 gavilán et al 2007 liu et al 2009 and has become the standard input required to be used in conjunction with kc values for crop irrigation scheduling allen et al 1998 doorenbos et al 1977 this approach has been shown to be simple convenient and reproducible for many crops in different climate conditions allen and pereira 2009 this may explain its widespread international use in irrigation scheduling of vegetable crops allen et al 1998 cahn and johnson 2017 pardossi and incrocci 2011 however kc represents a relative measurement of crop et and therefore each cwb model requires specifically parametrized and evaluated kc or et0 under local conditions allen et al 1998 elia and conversa 2015 guerra et al 2016 olberz et al 2018 allen et al 1998 describes two approaches based on the use kc which contribute the principle of etc estimates in irrigation scheduling systems of vegetable crops cahn and johnson 2017 pardossi and incrocci 2011b since it assumes site and crop specific adjustments of et0 or kc cwb models may have a regional scope e g elia and conversa 2015 olberz et al 2018 the cwb model gescon elia and conversa 2015 has been parametrized in a mediterranean climate and validated with processing tomato under subtropical conditions in florida conversa et al 2015 the geisenheim irrigation scheduling gs has been parametrized in a temperate climate hartmann et al 2000 olberz et al 2018 zinkernagel 2019 and validated with white cabbage under four different climate conditions in germany krumbein and germanus 2014 in addition to climate soil cultivar specific characteristics and differences in cultivation practices all have an effect on etc allen et al 1998 mirás avalos et al 2019 existing etc models consider these variables by static correction factors such as the water stress coefficient ks or the percentage reduction of kc kcb for surface mulch allen et al 1998 some provide studies by phenological stage specific kc chattaraj et al 2013 hartmann et al 2000 piccinni et al 2009 there are efforts to adjust or determine kc dynamically to prevailing growing conditions of open field vegetable crops the approaches can be distinguished between i plant density based using the fraction of ground cover and crop height allen and pereira 2009 grattan et al 1998 or leaf area index lai de medeiros et al 2001 erdem et al 2010 čereković et al 2010 ii temperature based rahimikhoob 2010 kullberg et al 2017 and iii vegetation indices based e g the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi kamble et al 2013 kizil et al 2012 cf section vegetation indices the advantage of dynamic models over static kc models such as fao 56 allen et al 1998 is to better adapt the amount and timing of irrigation to the actual water requirements especially for vegetable crops this may involve ensuring product quality and quantity while reducing unproductive water supply and nitrate leaching olberz und zinkernagel unpublished data dynamic kc models also allow for automatic computation of irrigation scheduling some of these model approaches are applied in the dss available for open field vegetable crops mirás avalos et al 2019 giusti and marsili libelli 2015 bonfil et al 2004 elia and conversa 2015 a comprehensive review of the current dss available for irrigation scheduling is reported in gallardo et al 2020 model algorithms for advanced applications must be able to be integrated as well free and open source software foss may be the key for this a foss that defines the interfaces and provides the algorithm of the cwb model may enable the dss to be i reliably reproducible in model calculation ii extended by local specific parameters iii integrated into commercial systems and thus iv improved and widely used to the best of our knowledge gsehen based on geisenheimer irrigation scheduling is the first foss for vegetable crop irrigation scheduling available olberz and zinkernagel 2019 recently an algorithm for separately determining soil evaporation and plant transpiration was developed and tested in lettuce and watermelon in eastern spain mirás avalos et al 2019 this algorithm enables the individual consideration of two main components for water extraction within a vegetable field and better considers specificities in soil management such as the use of mulch the commercial exploitation of the routines has been licensed to a private company hispatec almería spain https www hispatec com and has been integrated into a more general enterprise resource planning software in addition to tools based on et estimates there are also methods based on et measurements the bowen ratio energy balance is a micrometeorological method used to determine the evaporative flux from the vegetation surface it has been widely used with short natural vegetation agricultural and vegetable crops to measure eta casa et al 2000 fernández 2014 grattan et al 1998 goyal et al 2013 scott et al 2003 teixeira et al 2007 zábranský et al 2015 this wide use is due to its simplicity and relatively low cost this technique provides continuous unattended measurements and requires no information about the aerodynamic characteristics of the surface of interest and it can even integrate latent heat fluxes over large areas todd et al 2000 grattan et al 1998 used the bowen ratio energy balance in california to relate crop coefficients to the fraction of vegetation cover fc for several open field vegetable crops they concluded that kc changed as a quadratic function of percentage ground cover fernández 2014 in south eastern spain presented a new vision based computer method for estimating kc obtained from the data provided by a bowen ratio station of lettuce crops based on digital photographs of the vegetation cover casa et al 2000 indicated that the bowen ratio technique generally only worked for short periods one growing season because of the difficulties associated with instrument maintenance and missing data however it can be successfully used in studies of seasonal crop water use there have also been recent developments in small lysimeters adapted to vegetable crops that are able to determine eta fronza and folegatti 2003 the possibility of combining the lysimeter output data originally conceived for an initial application in potted plants ruiz peñalver et al 2015 with irrigation scheduling recommendations is also now under development jiménez carvajal et al 2017 this application is still only used for research applications but its incorporation into electronic components is becoming more accessible as costs become cheaper we believe that this accessibility will increase in the near future as well as the potential use of lysimeters commercially as they could be used in a similar manner with complex multi depth soil sensors the successful implementation of this type of device will not only allow us to quantitatively determine et but also to collect drainage samples this would also be helpful in improving the frequency of irrigation and to determine the actual absolute values of nitrate leaching caution needs to be taken however when extrapolating the measurements carried out within the lysimeter soil and the surrounding fields particularly soil bulk density should be restored in the lysimeter after its installation as in the original field which is a difficult task to be conducted properly 2 4 remote sensing tools perhaps the most focused upon field of research in europe is on satellite or uav unmanned aircraft vehicle based sensing of crop water requirements alvino and marino 2017 and cahn and johnson 2017 provided an overview of remote sensing methods and systems for irrigation scheduling of horticultural and vegetable crops however a drawback of these methods is the frequent cloud formation in northern and central europe which constrains the usability of satellite based models the use of uavs may therefore be a promising technique for proximity and remote sensing of irrigation requirements to counter the cloud coverage dilemma for etc determination proximity and remote sensing techniques can be categorized into two approaches based on i vegetation indices vis and ii energy balance table 3 2 4 1 vegetation indices in recent decades several spectral vegetation indices vis have been introduced the use of spectral reflectance indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi has been proposed as a fast non destructive way of estimating crop growth capacity fortes et al 2015 the estimations for the fc derived from ndvi are highly relevant for a wide range of irrigation scheduling models cahn and johnson 2017 for irrigation scheduling there are several significant vi based approaches a good example of these are i the use of vis to evaluate the vegetation parameters such as fc and leaf area index lai amongst other variables glenn et al 2011 trout et al 2008 verger et al 2009 and ii the estimation of kc for etc calculation using a satellite derived vi calera et al 2017 er raki et al 2010 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 jayanthi et al 2007 kamble et al 2013 mateos et al 2013 torres sánchez et al 2015 kamble et al 2013 identified the accurate determination of kc using satellite derived vi curves for each crop in different climatic conditions as one of the most potent solutions for surface and underground water resources as well as for the optimization of their consumption in agriculture ramírez cuesta et al 2019 developed a gis tool box for computing ndvi maps of lettuce crops adjusting the tabulated fao kc according to the vegetation index obtained from sentinel ii images this allows taking into account the effect of local conditions on crop development which in the case of vegetable crops is highly dependent on the variety grown and the temperature regime the drawback for this approach as for any other remote sensing method is its limited use in the case of utilizing cover material such crop protection blankets or simple plastic tunnels courault et al 2008 focused on assessing the potential of formosat 2 data characterized by high spatial 8 m pixel and temporal resolutions 1 3 day time revisit to improve crop modelling and spatial estimation of the main land properties the results showed that the high temporal and spatial resolutions of these new remote sensing data could provide accurate surface parameters that lead to satisfactory flux simulations when used as input data in both land surface models tested jayanthi et al 2007 successfully estimated daily etc for potato using basal and canopy reflectance based kc in addition the spatial variability of actual crop water demand was detected using high resolution multispectral aerial imagery algorithms based on a triangle approach which is itself derived from 8 day modis ts and ndvi scatterplots were evaluated by garcia et al 2014 to estimate the surface water deficit in two sites with different climatic controls on eta in andalusia spain during different growth stages of the winter crops season the analyses showed that the quality of air temperature data had the most significant influence on the accuracy of the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi to estimate the surface water deficit torres sánchez et al 2015 used the object based image analysis obia which was applied to vegetation detection in remote sensed images captured with two sensors one sensor was a conventional visible light camera and the other sensor was a multispectral camera these sensors were mounted on an uav and data was collected over three different fields of herbaceous crops these tests assessed the performance of the obia algorithm for classifying vegetation coverage and how it was affected by different automatically selected thresholds calculated in the images of two vegetation indices the excess green and the ndvi campoy et al 2019 described the integration of a time series of ndvi based on satellite remote sensing into crop growth models for the estimation of the light and water use efficiencies in biomass production for garlic in south eastern spain caparrini and manzella 2009 presented the first estimations of meteorological and vis for an integrated system developed in the central region of tuscany italy this system incorporated the cross evaluation of the standardized precipitation index spi vis from remote sensing from modis and sevirimsg outputs from the distributed hydrological model mobidic and applied them in real time for water balance evaluation and hydrological forecast the results of this work have shown that neither the spi nor the vis alone can completely depict the severity of drought conditions the drought monitoring system will serve as a very valuable tool to support decision making in the management and evaluation of water resources once it is operational and improved 2 4 2 energy balance the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 2000 is one of the most widely known algorithms for the estimation of et using satellite images rahimi et al 2015 furthermore the sebal is widely used to compute etc this approach uses satellite data as an input and quantifies the energy balance by measuring visible near infrared and thermal radiation tasumi et al 2003 in addition to satellite images the sebal model requires weather parameters such as wind speed humidity solar radiation and air temperature the sebal is capable of estimating et from the latent heat flux without previous information about the soil crop and management conditions bastiaanssen et al 2005 it uses satellite data on surface temperature from thermal infrared bands and data on reflectance from visible near infrared and shortwave infrared bands the three primary biophysical variables required for the input of landsat images into sebal are i surface brightness temperature sbt and ii multi spectral remote sensing data vis nir and tir which allow for the mapping of surface albedo and iii ndvi the latent heat flux or et is computed using the satellite acquisition time as the residual of the energy balance courault et al 2008 however this method was shown to have several drawbacks it requires thermal infrared data which is not easily available in the frequency or resolution required to schedule irrigation of fields i e it relies on the presence of extreme soil temperature hot and cold or dry and wet pixels in the imagery these methods may under scale the true potential surface temperature range without the presence of high water use crops in the imagery under these conditions sebal may provide erroneous estimations gowda et al 2008 since sebal was designed to be applied in relatively small areas with sharp contrasts in temperature and albedo it may be difficult to utilize it at the continental scale van den hurk 2001 ramos et al 2009 established eta measurements using mebes surface energy balance in spanish for the ebro basin in north eastern spain the results showed that the remote sensing algorithm could provide accurate daily eta estimations as compared with lysimeter measurements of daily et values however the sensitivity of remote sensing techniques to crop conditions and the influence of climatic and meteorological conditions limits their application gobbo et al 2019 recommended that the sebal should be coupled with crop simulation models e g dssat to overcome its limited use during long cloudy periods and that its application should be based on satellite data with higher spatial and temporal resolutions however the effectiveness of the sebal over different geographical areas is still an open question in addition it is difficult to implement the sebal or any other energy balance approach in practical applications for irrigation scheduling but we believe that in the near future with advancements in computing techniques and iot applications a commercial solution will become available this section has described the various approaches methods and systems for irrigation scheduling in non limited conditions their suitability is determined by the diverse requirements of the cropping conditions of vegetables in an open field the field of application results from weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each system table 3 the selection of an appropriate irrigation scheduling system depends on various factors such as irrigation technique irrigation frequency crop architecture e g partial or full ground cover crop plot size soil climate conditions availability of data and communication infrastructure and demands on the accuracy in water use other than selecting the best method for a specific cultivation condition it must be taken into consideration that some approaches only deal with the time of water demand and do not provide any information on the water volume needed thus promising approaches such as remote sensing or soil moisture sensors have to meet the demand of a stand alone method de pascale et al 2018 for irrigation scheduling 2 4 3 plant water status indicators determining plant water status is theoretically the most scientifically sound approach for replacing plant water needs several excellent reviews have been published jones 2004 fernández 2014 damm et al 2018 which mainly focus on tree crops where more approaches could be used due to their woody structures initial research in vegetable crops has been focused on evaluating the usefulness of stem diameter variations for detecting plant water status gallardo et al 2006a 2006b this work focused on reporting the feasibility of using stem dendrometers depending on the crop type with the phenological period and the evaporative demand limiting the practical use for this tool sap flow sensors can be employed to trace transpiration and therefore determine both plant water use and the degree of water stress however soil evaporation will remain to be quantified with complementary tools and the absolute transpiration values that could be obtained might not properly represent the actual transpiration rates because of the many assumptions required to convert heat tracer signals to water flow flo et al 2019 in open field vegetable crops a review by pardossi and incrocci 2011 summarized the current methods available at that time and the practical commercial solutions and envisioned how canopy temperature determinations were going to play an important role at present plant water status sensing applications see table 3 for a brief summary of the solutions available are preferentially based on canopy reflectance data that can be monitored at different spatial and temporal resolution scales depending on the platform used damm et al 2018 the application of this type of technology in an automatic irrigation controller is however still hampered by the difficulty in interpreting the data obtained this is because plant water status is not only determined by the soil water available to the plant but also on several endogenous factors of the environment and the plant which are difficult to integrate damm et al 2018 3 irrigation management under water quantity constraints when water availability fails to meet a crop s requirements irrigation can be scheduled by partial root zone drying strategies jensen et al 2010 where only a limited volume of the root zone is wetted by the irrigation system alternatively irrigation can be reduced during the entire crop growing period deficit irrigation or only in those phenological stages in which yield is relatively less sensitive to soil water deficits regulated deficit irrigation rdi this last option was developed in the 1980s as a strategy to reduce vegetative growth of vigorous trees and to save water behboudian and mills 1997 there are important limitations of rdi for vegetable crops because their growth stages are not clearly defined or of sufficient duration during which water restrictions could be preferentially applied additionally vegetable crops are generally shallow rooted and rapidly experience the negative effects of irrigating at less than potential etc stanley and maynard 1990 this is particularly relevant for crops such as lettuce and other leafy vegetables which are normally grown for harvesting their entire biomass for instance capra et al 2008 found a significant decrease in lettuce production as et decreased in addition other vegetable crops where fruits are harvested such as pepper are also sensitive to water restrictions in fact a recent research study concluded that deficit irrigation detrimentally affected pepper yield regardless of the period in which water was restricted concluding that this practice was not well suited for sweet pepper abdelkhalik et al 2020 for watermelon under sustained deficit irrigation yield decreased linearly in response to an increase in water stress rouphael et al 2008 when the sensitivity of watermelon plants to water restrictions was analysed erdem and yuskel 2003 concluded that flowering was the most sensitive phenological stage to water restrictions in this sense the authors found that fruit ripening was the phenological period that was better suited for the application of deficit irrigation in view of the positive effects on fruit quality therefore the possible practical implementation of any deficit irrigation program should be restricted to vegetable crops with generative organs such as melon and tomato where some water deficit applied only late in the season could help increase the fruit s soluble solids content abdelkhalik et al 2019 lu et al 2019 or specific metabolites such as lycopene and other bioactive compounds in the case of tomato fruit klunklin and savage 2017 despite the potential negative effect of rdi on vegetable crops we expect that in the near future as water scarcity and its price increase rdi could occasionally be employed as a strategy to maximize economic benefits considering not only the crop water requirements and the water use efficiency but an integrated cost benefit analysis as well fernández et al 2020 the use of rdi will also have implications for fertilization management and it is necessary to better tailor it to the water stress and its impacts on carbon partitioning on plant nutrient requirements this requires further study and a more holistic approach where both water and nitrogen use efficiency are jointly assessed this has already been investigated in field crops quemada and gabriel 2016 however there have also been attempts with potato badr et al 2012 as well as tomato du et al 2018 in general while increasing the nitrogen rate and thus the risk of nitrate leaching has positive effects on water productivity nitrogen use efficiency is optimized at intermediate nitrogen levels particularly when deficit irrigation is applied du et al 2018 4 conclusion and future perspectives this review has analysed several options for optimizing crop water productivity in open field vegetable crops while reducing water body contaminations and encompasses many recent works published in this field in terms of irrigation scheduling the focus was to analyse the advantages and limitations of existing approaches summarizing the main commercial applications already available for use in commercial situations technologies and approaches were assessed in terms of their potential to overcome water scarcity caused by climate change and the need to protect soil and groundwater while maintaining yield and product quality due to the increasing pressure on water resources from other economic activities irrigation of vegetable crops will have to be adapted to ensure an appropriate sub optimal plant water status in addition the potential applications of predicting water status beyond irrigation control have yet to be fully exploited predicting the short term and seasonal water status can be integrated into dss for managing additional irrigation practices to also determine the plant s water status more mechanistic research is needed to be able to incorporate the water status prediction models into decision support tools for drought and salinity stress monitoring new approaches in irrigation management should lead to an improvement in water management at the field level additionally the development of accurate irrigation scheduling calibrated to function under local conditions is a key component in the sustainability of irrigation the application of remote sensing technology in the last decade has led to significant advancements and improvements in irrigation management in the coming years the advancements in satellite based irrigation techniques should be utilized more extensively in a broader variety of conditions this will not only advance research in this field but will also improve the practical application of this approach coupling plant based models with remote sensing applications could be then employed to increase the spatial representation of the specific water status estimations current information technologies sebal webgis uav and smartphones support local farmers by easing the flow of information regarding the optimization of irrigation advice this is conducted in a user friendly medium allowing for the timely delivery of information the new remote sensing advancements summarized in this review should result in an easy integration of both specific measurements and model estimations on the ground to the entire field or even at the irrigation district level in the future user friendly techniques should be more extensively applied and farmers should be able to use scientific scheduling irrigation methods to be able to minimize water contamination risks due to inefficient irrigation the best irrigation technologies for water delivery off and on farm should be combined with irrigation scheduling programs based on the knowledge of soil characteristics and the water requirements of local crops the recent new developments for inexpensive and simple irrigation controllers could be used to differentially irrigated

10459,measures that maximize in situ infiltration and utilization of rainfall are urgently needed on the loess plateau to minimize problems associated with drought and soil erosion and to improve the sustainability of arid and semi arid agricultural production in this region here we present a two year field assessment of two rainfall control systems a rainwater collection and infiltration rwci system and a semi circular basin fish scale pit fsp that could improve soil water storage sws and deep soil organic carbon soc levels in apple malus pumila mill orchards on a slope the rwci system performed better than the fsp system at conserving and utilizing rainwater resources and conserving rhizosphere soil water to meet the water demand of commercial apple orchards the rwci system decreased the soil water storage deficit wd and enhanced the soc content of the root zone due to precipitation whereas the fsp had little effect the rwci system rwci60 and rwci80 significantly increased soil water and soc contents by 73 and 81 respectively relative to the control the design depth of the rwci system should match the root distribution of adjacent crops to make rwci a recommended sustainable approach for maximizing the utilization of rainwater resources and the conservation of rhizosphere soil water in standing orchards this system should help to mitigate the effect of climate change on water scarcity in arid and semi arid regions with potential for application in other orchard crops and regions keywords soil water storage soil water deficit soc content in situ deep infiltration loess plateau 1 introduction the global water resource crisis is a critical problem for sustainable development human activities such as industry and agriculture need water to function fisher and freund 2012 water resources are severely limited in arid and semi arid areas which cover 30 of the earth s surface huang et al 2008 due to climatic factors and poor land management giorgi and bi 2005 growing demand for water coupled with poor water management has increased water stress in many parts of the world hoanh et al 2015 guterres 2018 the hilly region of the loess plateau in china has a semi arid environment fu 1989 fu et al 2004 and is one of the most erodible places in the world soil erosion has severely degraded soil quality and productivity in this area gao

one of the main perennial fruit trees planted in northern china access to soil moisture is a significant issue for rainfed apple orchards established on sloping land on the loess plateau of china where water resources are scarce the grain for green large scale ecological rehabilitation project on the loess plateau initiated by the chinese government in 1999 saw a rapid increase in the growing area of apple orchards in hilly regions of the loess plateau which has helped to conserve soil and water and improve the region s economic prospects fu et al 2004 zhao et al 2009 chen et al 2010 huang et al 2014 feng et al 2016 wang et al 2016 however the rapid development of large scale apple orchards has increased soil water consumption giorgi and bi 2005 gao et al 2014 to further deepen the soil water deficit in this region chen et al 2007 gao et al 2014 once the initial soil water supply has been exploited restored non commercial forests often become degraded due to the lack of proper soil and water management chen et al 2007 gao et al 2014 which could further reduce production and increase land degradation gao et al 2014 these problems are also prevalent in similar regions of the world garcía tejero et al 2011 consoli et al 2014 hoanh et al 2015 therefore increasing infiltration from precipitation and decreasing soil evaporation is important for the sustainability of rainfed orchards in water limited regions many field studies have shown that organic mulching e g straw mulching and branching mulching can increase soil water storage by reducing storm runoff increasing infiltration and decreasing evaporation sas paszt et al 2014 moreno ramón et al 2014 sadeghi et al 2015 li et al 2016 the cited studies were all implemented at sites with soil surfaces and all reported that organic mulching significantly increased the soil water holding capacity especially in shallow soil layers 60 cm suman and raina 2014 gao et al 2011 in many regions of china a semi circular basin or fish scale pit fsp can effectively store rainfall runoff and increase rainfall infiltration and the soil water conversion rate of precipitation li et al 2016 however during dry periods between rainstorms fsps increase soil evaporation due to the larger contact area of soil and air li et al 2016 therefore natural rainfall and soil water in the top layers do not meet the water demand of fruit trees here we introduce an in situ rainwater collection and infiltration rwci system in apple orchards on the loess plateau to improve rainwater catchment utilization by diverting rainwater and runoff to infiltrate deeper into the soil rhizosphere of trees song et al 2016 2017 2018 unlike organic mulching the storage pit of rwci is filled with agricultural organic materials e g maize straw and branches as a storage and buffer matrix without mulching the rwci directly channels rainwater collected into the crop root zone where it is stored a few studies have examined the effects of rwci on soil water and fine roots song et al 2017 2018 however it is not clear how rwci systems affect the time space distribution of soil water deficit compensation and root zone soc restoration here given the serious water shortage and lack of organic matter on the degraded slopes of the loess plateau this study assessed the effect of rwci systems on deep soil water retention and the degree of soc restoration socre for ecological restoration of sloping apple orchard ecosystems in the semi arid region of the loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site a field

treatment in a completely randomized design i ck bare soil without any water saving technique ii fsp semi circular basin iii rwci60 mini catchments using a rainwater collection and infiltration system with a soil pit depth of 60 cm and iv rwci80 mini catchments using a rainwater collection and infiltration system with a soil pit depth of 80 cm in march 2015 an apple orchard was selected based on canopy area tree architecture and canopy diameter of the apple trees the fsps and rwcis were established on a cultivated sloping orchard fig 3 where the fsps were dug into the slope and the excavated earth used to form a wall around the semi circles with 170 cm radius and 15 cm depth for collecting rainfall runoff each rwci had five components fsp soil pit 80 cm 80 cm at 60 cm or 80 cm depth base layer of impermeable material organic composite porous material 65 various plant residues crop straw weeds leaves branches or other organic waste as the main raw material mixed with 20 animal manure and 15 orchard soil pvc drain pipe 55 cm or 75 cm in length 15 cm diameter with holes 10 mm in diameter at 2 cm intervals along the tube s wall and black plastic film for the rwcis the soil pits were dug in the center of the fsp starting 90 cm directly behind the tree trunk the bottom of each pit was lined with impermeable material and the pvc drain pipe was placed vertically in the center of each pit the space around the tube was then filled with the organic composite porous material and the surface of this space was covered with plastic film song et al 2017 a photograph of this system is shown in fig 3c no irrigation was applied during the test so all water was supplied exclusively by natural rainfall 2 3 soil water measurements and soc sampling soil water content was measured at 20 cm increments to 280 cm depth using a portable time domain reflectometer tdr system trime pico iph tdr germany consisting of a trime iph probe a trime data logger and fiberglass access tubes φ 40 mm the fiberglass access tubes were installed in november 2014 using a hand auger φ 45 mm at a distance of 0 4 m 0 6 m and 0 8 m upslope from the tree trunk examined in each treatment fig 3b the space between the tube and soil was filled with diluted mud consisting of water and soil to minimize gaps and maximize the precision of the measurements soil water content was recorded dynamically at least three times each month during the growing season from may to november 2015 and march to november 2016 additional measurements were performed after rainfall events sixteen sites four for each treatment near the access tubes were used to measure soil water content gravimetrically to calibrate the system the tdr derived soil moisture values θ t d r c m 3 c m 3 for these treatments were measured using the tdr tool at 20 cm increments to 280 cm depth we also sampled soil at these sites at 20 cm increments to 280 cm depth using a hand auger φ 45 mm to measure gravimetric soil moisture content θ the holes were backfilled after sampling the dry soil bulk density ρ g cm 3 is shown in table 2 the θ values were then transformed into volumetric moisture content values θ v c m 3 c m 3 and a calibration curve was created by plotting the measured tdr derived soil moisture values θ t d r c m 3 c m 3 against the volumetric moisture contents the linear regression yielded the following equation 1 θ v 1 49 θ t d r 4 352 r 2 0 906 soil samples were collected to estimate deep soc under rcis after apple harvest in november 2016 each sample was extracted at 20 cm depth intervals to 180 cm depth using a hand auger with an internal diameter of 40 mm nine replicate samples were collected at each depth at locations close to those used for soil water measurement before taking the soil samples to the laboratory for soc determination they were transferred to plastic bags air dried and passed through a 0 25 mm sieve soc contents were measured using a modified variant of the walkley and black method fu et al 2010b 2 4 evaluating metrics soil water storage sws soil water quantity at a certain soil depth soil water storage deficit degree wd soil water storage deficit compensation ws and the degree of soil organic carbon restoration socre were computed to assess the performance of the tested rainfall regulation method for agroecological restoration of orchards the sws is a key component of the soil water balance and can be used to assess infiltration efficiency wd and ws are commonly used as indices for measuring the replenishment of soil water storage by rainfall in hydrological studies of water conservation tomas et al 2014 and were used in this study to analyze the degree of water compensation and recovery the socre was compared with control plots ck to determine the degree of soc restoration and assess its usefulness in ecological restoration the sws wd ws and socre were defined as follows ⅰ sws 2 s w s m n i m n θ i ρ i δ h i 10 100 by combining eq s 1 and 2 3 s w s m n i m n

the data were analyzed with a one way analysis of variance anova using origin pro 2016 ibm software multiple comparisons based on the least significant difference lsd with p 0 05 were performed to test for significant differences between treatments for sws wd ws socre and soil properties 3 results 3 1 temporal variation of soil water storage fig 4 shows the time series of soil water storage sws at various depth intervals during the dy 2015 and ny 2016 growing periods for different treatments the rwci and fsp systems increased sws of deep soils not only after rainfall but also over the whole apple growing season the rwci systems were better at collecting rainfall and retaining water than fsp which was probably attributed to increased rainfall infiltration and reduced soil evaporation the rwci60 had the strongest overall effect on sws in the 0 100 cm soil layer with increases of 76 in dy 2015 and 51 in ny 2016 relative to ck compared with the control the time averaged sws values for fsp rwci60 and rwci80 increased by 13 35 and 51 respectively in dy 2015 and 6 40 and 58 respectively in ny 2016 3 2 soil water storage deficit wd and its compensatory ws effects fig 5 shows the degree of wd for the studied orchards over the experimental period for all methods wd in the 0 100 cm soil layer decreased over winter november 2015 to february 2016 and after apparent rainfall events e g july 2016 and increased during drought periods e g may to july 2015 although rainfall could compensate for some soil water loss soil water deficit remained after apparent rainfall events compared with the control ck the wd in the rwci and fsp plots declined dramatically the rainfall control methods fsp rwci60 and rwci80 had significantly lower wd than ck in all soil layers 0 280 cm especially the top 100 cm fig 5 among others rwci60 and rwci80 were more effective at reducing wd in the 0 100 cm layer and rwci80 was more effective at reducing wd in the 100 280 cm layer for example rwci60 had 32 dy 2015 and 45 ny 2016 lower wd than fsp in the 0 100 cm soil layer rwci80 decreased wd over the full soil depth profile by 22 dy 2015 and 32 ny 2016 relative to fsp fig 6 shows the variation in ws with soil depth during the rainy season at the study site using different rainfall regulation methods in dy 2015 ws decreased sharply in the 0 80 cm soil layer in all treatments deeper in the soil profile ws tended to be stable for ck and fsp and decreased slightly for rwci60 and rwci80 over depth positive values for ws were observed in the 0 60 cm soil layer for ck 0 80 cm for fsp 0 120 cm for rwci60 and 0 160 cm for rwci80 which were the precipitation compensation depths pcd below which negative ws values were presented this indicates that rainfall regulation methods especially rwci systems can increase pcd however these systems produced significantly higher ws than ck in the 0 200 cm layer the soil water storage deficit value ranged from 20 to 45 in ny 2016 and 60 to 120 in dy 2015 indicating that the drought year had superior compensation and rehabilitation effects in the normal year following the rainy season however this does not mean that dy 2015 had a superior water situation to ny 2016 compared to ck and fsp the rwcis had stronger positive compensatory effects i e significantly higher and positive ws values on soil water in the 0 120 cm layer in dy 2015 and over the entire soil profile in ny 2016 this shows that the rwci systems directly diverted rainwater collected into the root zone which resulted in compensatory effects for soil water storage in deep soil layers 3 3 soil organic carbon soc and the degree of its restoration socre the soc content and socre at 0 180 cm depth under different methods of rainfall regulation are shown in fig 7 as expected by the end of the two year field experiment the rwcis had sharply increased soc content and socre the fsp rwci60 and rwci80 systems had markedly higher soc contents at 0 180 cm depth than ck and rwci60 and rwci80 had greater positive compensatory effects on deep soc than fsp on average the fsp rwci60 and rwci80 systems had 18 73 and 81 higher soc contents at 0 180 cm depth than ck respectively fig 7a b rwci60 and rwci80 had 225 and 267 higher socre at 0 180 cm depth than fsp respectively indicating that the rwcis exerted strong positive compensatory effects on soc fig 7c d 4 discussion 4 1 soil water recharge rainfall is the most valuable water resource for plants in the rainfed orchards of the hilly loess region its exploitation is an effective method for reducing water shortages and more importantly is critical to the sustainability of the orchards ling et al 2017 the cumulative precipitation in the hilly loess region was 391 7 mm and 500 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 2 yet the water demand of large scale commercial apple orchards is 676 5 mm meng 2011 therefore the perennial apple orchards suffered severe drought stress large area semi circular basins fsps have been built on the loess plateau of china to combat soil and water losses and improve the agricultural ecosystem li et al 2016 as shown in this study other studies have indicated that fsps can reduce the slopes roughness improve rainfall infiltration and ensure water supply for plants during the rainy season fu et al 2010a li et al 2016 however they do not effectively intercept sediment due to their small storage capacity wang et al 2014 in our study the fsp method captured and stored some water especially during the rainy seasons but its water storage capacity was inadequate over the two study years especially in the drought year 2015 as an alternative to the fsp method we tested in situ rainwater collection and infiltration systems rwcis which enable direct deep infiltration of water into the rhizosphere soil each rwci contains a large volume of organic composite porous material chopped organic material and absorbent composites that serves as a buffer matrix to hold standing water and provide a sustained supply of water to support crop growth water storage in the rwcis remained relatively stable across each growing season the rwcis outperformed fsps for collecting and retaining water probably because they improved rainfall infiltration and reduced soil evaporation song et al 2017 these effects were especially pronounced for the deeper rwci rwci80 figs 4 and 5 our results indicate that the rwcis significantly increased soil water storage fig 4 and decreased soil water storage deficit fig 6 and table 3 over the 2015 and 2016 apple growing seasons and appeared to be better at collecting rainfall and retaining water than fsp we found that the basal water consumption demand of apple trees in the main soil root zone 0 100 cm can be met solely via rainfall with an rwci system especially rwci60 soil water storage which persisted throughout the growing season as demonstrated under bare soil ck dramatically improved using only natural precipitation in conjunction with rainfall control methods particularly rwci60 and rwci80 the rwcis directly diverted rainwater collected into the deep soil resulting in positive compensatory effects on soil water in deep soil layers 4 2 soc restoration soil organic carbon soc is a key determinant of soil quality soil erosion and degradation the soil s ability to withstand drought plant nutrient adsorption and crop yield huang et al 2007 nieder and benbi 2008 sadikhani et al 2014 the soc contents in the main apple production regions in china located in yan an tongchuan weinan and baoji cities of shaanxi province are higher in the west and south and lower in the east and north with the highest in baoji city and lowest in yan an city zheng et al 2017 the soc content of apple orchards in yan an city range from 2 1 to 9 0 g kg 1 with 60 of orchards ranging from 2 9 to 5 8 g kg 1 zheng et al 2017 the apple orchard in this study had a low soc content being 2 27 g kg 1 in the 0 60 cm soil layer we found that fsp improved soil conditions and soc in the short term but not to satisfactory levels for soil and water conservation unlike fsp the rwci storage pit is filled with agricultural organic material e g maize straw and branches as a storage and buffer matrix which directly channels and stores rainwater in the apple tree root zone the agricultural organic material decomposed over time in the rwci pits to actively promote soc accumulation in the main soil root zone increasing by 73 and 81 in the rwci60 and rwci80 treatments respectively relative to fsp fig 7 thus the rwci method has beneficial effects on soil water content and soc and could markedly improve soil function and quality and the soil s capacity to provide regulatory ecosystem services 4 3 implications rational regulation and utilization of rainwater the main source of agricultural production and ecological restoration in hilly regions of the loess plateau may counter the main driver of soil and water losses alleviate drought and water shortages and enable efficient utilization of soil and water resources zhao and wu 2013 wang et al 2016 land engineering projects practices e g creation of level terraced fields and mini catchments such as fsp have been established to conserve soil and water on the slopes in these regions which will increase evaporation our study found that rwcis with no or few irrigation conditions are essential for the sustainable development of apple orchards in hilly regions of the loess plateau to increase soil water storage and reduce drought effects as they combine land engineering measures fsps and organic composite porous material the addition of organic composite porous material as a buffer matrix in the rwci pits was crucial for the retention and continuous supply of collected rain the economics of using organic composite porous material needs to be considered various plant residues including crop straw weeds leaves branches or other organic wastes used in this study are readily available in the region gathering and using these local materials will minimize waste and reduce transportation costs while improving in situ rainwater harvesting and utilization further strengthening the ecological benefits and economic performance of rainfed orchards in semi arid hillslopes how the rwci method affects soil water infiltration evapotranspiration soc content and soc partitioning to apple roots as well as its impact on apple yield are under investigation future studies should focus on these issues to guide the sustainable development of orchards on the loess plateau and other similar sloping landscapes of the world 5 conclusion the rwci system effectively retained runoff directly promoting deep infiltration into the rhizosphere soil the retention of organic composite porous material as a buffer matrix to hold standing water greatly reduced the driving force of rainfall runoff for soil erosion the widespread adoption of rwcis should enable deep infiltration of rainfall and satisfy the water demands of growing apple trees using only collected rainwater the rwci method significantly increased soil water storage by 51 rwci60 and 35 rwci80 and decreased soil water deficit by 40 rwci60 and 29 rwci80 in the 0 100 cm soil layer and collected and retained rainfall better than fsp the fsp treatment increased soc content by only 18 relative to ck while rwci60 and rwci80 increased soc by 73 and 81 respectively the rwci method could be the best choice in water limited areas as it appears to be a powerful and practical tool for overcoming drought improving deep soil water availability and supporting ecologically important hydrological processes by preventing evaporation increasing deep water permeation and storage and preventing water loss and

decreased the soil water storage deficit wd and enhanced the soc content of the root zone due to precipitation whereas the fsp had little effect the rwci system rwci60 and rwci80 significantly increased soil water and soc contents by 73 and 81 respectively relative to the control the design depth of the rwci system should match the root distribution of adjacent crops to make rwci a recommended sustainable approach for maximizing the utilization of rainwater resources and the conservation of rhizosphere soil water in standing orchards this system should help to mitigate the effect of climate change on water scarcity in arid and semi arid regions with potential for application in other orchard crops and regions keywords soil water storage soil water deficit soc content in situ deep infiltration loess plateau 1 introduction the global water resource crisis is a critical problem for sustainable development human activities such as industry and agriculture need water to function fisher and freund 2012 water resources are severely limited in arid and semi arid areas which cover 30 of the earth s surface huang et al 2008 due to climatic factors and poor land management giorgi and bi 2005 growing demand for water coupled with poor water management has increased water stress in many parts of the world hoanh et al 2015 guterres 2018 the hilly region of the loess plateau in china has a semi arid environment fu 1989 fu et al 2004 and is one of the most erodible places in the world soil erosion has severely degraded soil quality and productivity in this area gao et al 2018 afforestation has been shown as an effective avenue to fight land degradation facilitate land development and improve soil quality feng et al 2016 wang et al 2016 apple malus pumila mill is one of the main perennial fruit trees planted in northern china access to soil moisture is a significant issue for rainfed apple orchards established on sloping land on the loess plateau of china where water resources are scarce the grain for green large scale ecological rehabilitation project on the loess plateau initiated by the chinese government in 1999 saw a rapid increase in the growing area of apple orchards in hilly regions of the loess plateau which has helped to conserve soil and water and improve the region s economic prospects fu et al 2004 zhao et al 2009 chen et al 2010 huang et al 2014 feng et al 2016 wang et al 2016 however the rapid development of large scale apple orchards has increased soil water consumption giorgi and bi 2005 gao et al 2014 to further deepen the soil water deficit in this region chen et al 2007 gao et al 2014 once the initial soil water supply has been exploited restored non commercial forests often become degraded due to the lack of proper soil and water management chen et al 2007 gao et al 2014 which could further reduce production and increase land degradation gao et al 2014 these problems are also prevalent in similar regions of the world garcía tejero et al 2011 consoli et al 2014 hoanh et al 2015 therefore increasing infiltration from precipitation and decreasing soil evaporation is important for the sustainability of rainfed orchards in water limited regions many field studies have shown that organic mulching e g straw mulching and branching mulching can increase soil water storage by reducing storm runoff increasing infiltration and decreasing evaporation sas paszt et al 2014 moreno ramón et al 2014 sadeghi et al 2015 li et al 2016 the cited studies were all implemented at sites with soil surfaces and all reported that organic mulching significantly increased the soil water holding capacity especially in shallow soil layers 60 cm suman and raina 2014 gao et al 2011 in many regions of china a semi circular basin or fish scale pit fsp can effectively store rainfall runoff and increase rainfall infiltration and the soil water conversion rate of precipitation li et al 2016 however during dry periods between rainstorms fsps increase soil evaporation due to the larger contact area of soil and air li et al 2016 therefore natural rainfall and soil water in the top layers do not meet the water demand of fruit trees here we introduce an in situ rainwater collection and infiltration rwci system in apple orchards on the loess plateau to improve rainwater catchment utilization by diverting rainwater and runoff to infiltrate deeper into the soil rhizosphere of trees song et al 2016 2017 2018 unlike organic mulching the storage pit of rwci is filled with agricultural organic materials e g maize straw and branches as a storage and buffer matrix without mulching the rwci directly channels rainwater collected into the crop root zone where it is stored a few studies have examined the effects of rwci on soil water and fine roots song et al 2017 2018 however it is not clear how rwci systems affect the time space distribution of soil water deficit compensation and root zone soc restoration here given the serious water shortage and lack of organic matter on the degraded slopes of the loess plateau this study assessed the effect of rwci systems on deep soil water retention and the degree of soc restoration socre for ecological restoration of sloping apple orchard ecosystems in the semi arid region of the loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site a field

treatment in a completely randomized design i ck bare soil without any water saving technique ii fsp semi circular basin iii rwci60 mini catchments using a rainwater collection and infiltration system with a soil pit depth of 60 cm and iv rwci80 mini catchments using a rainwater collection and infiltration system with a soil pit depth of 80 cm in march 2015 an apple orchard was selected based on canopy area tree architecture and canopy diameter of the apple trees the fsps and rwcis were established on a cultivated sloping orchard fig 3 where the fsps were dug into the slope and the excavated earth used to form a wall around the semi circles with 170 cm radius and 15 cm depth for collecting rainfall runoff each rwci had five components fsp soil pit 80 cm 80 cm at 60 cm or 80 cm depth base layer of impermeable material organic composite porous material 65 various plant residues crop straw weeds leaves branches or other organic waste as the main raw material mixed with 20 animal manure and 15 orchard soil pvc drain pipe 55 cm or 75 cm in length 15 cm diameter with holes 10 mm in diameter at 2 cm intervals along the tube s wall and black plastic film for the rwcis the soil pits were dug in the center of the fsp starting 90 cm directly behind the tree trunk the bottom of each pit was lined with impermeable material and the pvc drain pipe was placed vertically in the center of each pit the space around the tube was then filled with the organic composite porous material and the surface of this space was covered with plastic film song et al 2017 a photograph of this system is shown in fig 3c no irrigation was applied during the test so all water was supplied exclusively by natural rainfall 2 3 soil water measurements and soc sampling soil water content was measured at 20 cm increments to 280 cm depth using a portable time domain reflectometer tdr system trime pico iph tdr germany consisting of a trime iph probe a trime data logger and fiberglass access tubes φ 40 mm the fiberglass access tubes were installed in november 2014 using a hand auger φ 45 mm at a distance of 0 4 m 0 6 m and 0 8 m upslope from the tree trunk examined in each treatment fig 3b the space between the tube and soil was filled with diluted mud consisting of water and soil to minimize gaps and maximize the precision of the measurements soil water content was recorded dynamically at least three times each month during the growing season from may to november 2015 and march to november 2016 additional measurements were performed after rainfall events sixteen sites four for each treatment near the access tubes were used to measure soil water content gravimetrically to calibrate the system the tdr derived soil moisture values θ t d r c m 3 c m 3 for these treatments were measured using the tdr tool at 20 cm increments to 280 cm depth we also sampled soil at these sites at 20 cm increments to 280 cm depth using a hand auger φ 45 mm to measure gravimetric soil moisture content θ the holes were backfilled after sampling the dry soil bulk density ρ g cm 3 is shown in table 2 the θ values were then transformed into volumetric moisture content values θ v c m 3 c m 3 and a calibration curve was created by plotting the measured tdr derived soil moisture values θ t d r c m 3 c m 3 against the volumetric moisture contents the linear regression yielded the following equation 1 θ v 1 49 θ t d r 4 352 r 2 0 906 soil samples were collected to estimate deep soc under rcis after apple harvest in november 2016 each sample was extracted at 20 cm depth intervals to 180 cm depth using a hand auger with an internal diameter of 40 mm nine replicate samples were collected at each depth at locations close to those used for soil water measurement before taking the soil samples to the laboratory for soc determination they were transferred to plastic bags air dried and passed through a 0 25 mm sieve soc contents were measured using a modified variant of the walkley and black method

soil water balance and can be used to assess infiltration efficiency wd and ws are commonly used as indices for measuring the replenishment of soil water storage by rainfall in hydrological studies of water conservation tomas et al 2014 and were used in this study to analyze the degree of water compensation and recovery the socre was compared with control plots ck to determine the degree of soc

the data were analyzed with a one way analysis of variance anova using origin pro 2016 ibm software multiple comparisons based on the least significant difference lsd with p 0 05 were performed to test for significant differences between treatments for sws wd ws socre and soil properties 3 results 3 1 temporal variation of soil water storage fig 4 shows the time series of soil water storage sws at various depth intervals during the dy 2015 and ny 2016 growing periods for different treatments the rwci and fsp systems increased sws of deep soils not only after rainfall but also over the whole apple growing season the rwci systems were better at collecting rainfall and retaining water than fsp which was probably attributed to increased rainfall infiltration and reduced soil evaporation the rwci60 had the strongest overall effect on sws in the 0 100 cm soil layer with increases of 76 in dy 2015 and 51 in ny 2016 relative to ck compared with the control the time averaged sws values for fsp rwci60 and rwci80 increased by 13 35 and 51 respectively in dy 2015 and 6 40 and 58 respectively in ny 2016 3 2 soil water storage deficit wd and its compensatory ws effects fig 5 shows the degree of wd for the studied orchards over the experimental period for all methods wd in the 0 100 cm soil layer decreased over winter november 2015 to february 2016 and after apparent rainfall events e g july 2016 and increased during drought periods e g may to july 2015 although rainfall could compensate for some soil water loss soil water deficit remained after apparent rainfall events compared with the control ck the wd in the rwci and fsp plots declined dramatically the rainfall control methods fsp rwci60 and rwci80 had significantly lower wd than ck in all soil layers 0 280 cm especially the top 100 cm fig 5 among others rwci60 and rwci80 were more effective at reducing wd in the 0 100 cm layer and rwci80 was more effective at reducing wd in the 100 280 cm layer for example rwci60 had 32 dy 2015 and 45 ny 2016 lower wd than fsp in the 0 100 cm soil layer rwci80 decreased wd over the full soil depth profile by 22 dy 2015 and 32 ny 2016 relative to fsp fig 6 shows the variation in ws with soil depth during the rainy season at the study site using different rainfall regulation methods in dy 2015 ws decreased sharply in the 0 80 cm soil layer in all treatments deeper in the soil profile ws tended to be stable for ck and fsp and decreased slightly for rwci60 and rwci80 over depth positive values for ws were observed in the 0 60 cm soil layer for ck 0 80 cm for fsp 0 120 cm for rwci60 and 0 160 cm for rwci80 which were the precipitation compensation depths pcd below which negative ws values were presented this indicates that rainfall regulation methods especially rwci systems can increase pcd however these systems produced significantly higher ws than ck in the 0 200 cm layer the soil water storage deficit value ranged from 20 to 45 in ny 2016 and 60 to 120 in dy 2015 indicating that the drought year had superior compensation and rehabilitation effects in the normal year following the rainy season however this does not mean that dy 2015 had a superior water situation to ny 2016 compared to ck and fsp the rwcis had stronger positive compensatory effects i e significantly higher and positive ws values on soil water in the 0 120 cm layer in dy 2015 and over the entire soil profile in ny 2016 this shows that the rwci systems directly diverted rainwater collected into the root zone which resulted in compensatory effects for soil water storage in deep soil layers 3 3 soil organic carbon soc and the degree of its restoration socre the soc content and socre at 0 180 cm depth under different methods of rainfall regulation are shown in fig 7 as expected by the end of the two year field experiment the rwcis had sharply increased soc content and socre the fsp rwci60 and rwci80 systems had markedly higher soc contents at 0 180 cm depth than ck and rwci60 and rwci80 had greater positive compensatory effects on deep soc than fsp on average the fsp rwci60 and rwci80 systems had 18 73 and 81 higher soc contents at 0 180 cm depth than ck respectively fig 7a b rwci60 and rwci80 had 225 and 267 higher socre at 0 180 cm depth than fsp respectively indicating that the rwcis exerted strong positive compensatory effects on soc fig 7c d 4 discussion 4 1 soil water recharge rainfall is the most valuable water resource for plants in the rainfed orchards of the hilly loess region its exploitation is an effective method for reducing water shortages and more importantly is critical to the sustainability of the orchards ling et al 2017 the cumulative precipitation in the hilly loess region was 391 7 mm and 500 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 2 yet the water demand of large scale commercial apple orchards is 676 5 mm meng 2011 therefore the perennial apple orchards suffered severe drought stress large area semi circular basins fsps have been built on the loess plateau of china to combat soil and water losses and improve the agricultural ecosystem li et al 2016 as shown in this study other studies have indicated that fsps can reduce the slopes roughness improve rainfall infiltration and ensure water supply for plants during the rainy season fu et al 2010a li et al 2016 however they do not effectively intercept sediment due to their small storage capacity wang et al 2014 in our study the fsp method captured and stored some water especially during the rainy seasons but its water storage capacity was inadequate over the two study years especially in the drought year 2015 as an alternative to the fsp method we tested in situ rainwater collection and infiltration systems rwcis which enable direct deep infiltration of water into the rhizosphere soil each rwci contains a large volume of organic composite porous material chopped organic material and absorbent composites that serves as a buffer matrix to hold standing water and provide a sustained supply of water to support crop growth water storage in the rwcis remained relatively stable across each growing season the rwcis outperformed fsps for collecting and retaining water probably because they improved rainfall infiltration and reduced soil evaporation song et al 2017 these effects were especially pronounced for the deeper rwci rwci80 figs 4 and 5 our results indicate that the rwcis significantly increased soil water storage fig 4 and decreased soil water storage deficit fig 6 and table 3 over the 2015 and 2016 apple growing seasons and appeared to be better at collecting rainfall and retaining water than fsp we found that the basal water consumption demand of apple trees in the main soil root zone 0 100 cm can be met solely via rainfall with an rwci system especially rwci60 soil water storage which persisted throughout the growing season as demonstrated under bare soil ck dramatically improved using only natural precipitation in conjunction with rainfall control methods particularly rwci60 and rwci80 the rwcis directly diverted rainwater collected into the deep soil resulting in positive compensatory effects on soil water in deep soil layers 4 2 soc restoration soil organic carbon soc is a key determinant of soil quality soil erosion and degradation the soil s ability to withstand drought plant nutrient adsorption and crop yield huang et al 2007 nieder and benbi 2008 sadikhani et al 2014 the soc contents in the main apple production regions in china located in yan an tongchuan weinan and baoji cities of shaanxi province are higher in the west and south and lower in the east and north with the highest in baoji city and lowest in yan an city zheng et al 2017 the soc content of apple orchards in yan an city range from 2 1 to 9 0 g kg 1 with 60 of orchards ranging from 2 9 to 5 8 g kg 1 zheng et al 2017 the apple orchard in this study had a low soc content being 2 27 g kg 1 in the 0 60 cm soil layer we found that fsp improved soil conditions and soc in the short term but not to satisfactory levels for soil and water conservation unlike fsp the rwci storage pit is filled with agricultural organic material e g maize straw and branches as a storage and buffer matrix which directly channels and stores rainwater in the apple tree root zone the agricultural organic material decomposed over time in the rwci pits to actively promote soc accumulation in the main soil root zone increasing by 73 and 81 in the rwci60 and rwci80 treatments respectively relative to fsp fig 7 thus the rwci method has beneficial effects on soil water content and soc and could markedly improve soil function and quality and the soil s capacity to provide regulatory ecosystem services 4 3 implications rational regulation and utilization of rainwater the main source of agricultural production and ecological restoration in hilly regions of the loess plateau may counter the main driver of soil and water losses alleviate drought and water shortages and enable efficient utilization of soil and water resources zhao and wu 2013 wang et al 2016 land engineering projects practices e g creation of level terraced fields and mini catchments such as fsp have been established to conserve soil and water on the slopes in these regions which will increase evaporation our study found that rwcis with no or few irrigation conditions are essential for the sustainable development of apple orchards in hilly regions of the loess plateau to increase soil water storage and reduce drought effects as they combine land engineering measures fsps and organic composite porous material the addition of organic composite porous material as a buffer matrix in the rwci pits was crucial for the retention and continuous supply of collected rain the economics of using organic composite porous material needs to be considered various plant residues including crop straw weeds leaves branches or other organic wastes used in this study are readily available in the region gathering and using these local materials will minimize waste and reduce transportation costs while improving in situ rainwater harvesting and utilization further strengthening the ecological benefits and economic performance of rainfed orchards in semi arid hillslopes how the rwci method affects soil water infiltration evapotranspiration soc content and soc partitioning to apple roots as well as its impact on apple yield are under investigation future studies should focus on these issues to guide the sustainable development of orchards on the loess plateau and other similar sloping landscapes of the world 5 conclusion the rwci system effectively retained runoff directly promoting deep infiltration into the rhizosphere soil the retention of organic composite porous material as a buffer matrix to hold standing water greatly reduced the driving force of rainfall runoff for soil erosion the widespread adoption of rwcis should enable deep infiltration of rainfall and satisfy the water demands of growing apple trees using only collected rainwater the rwci method significantly increased soil water storage by 51 rwci60 and 35 rwci80 and decreased soil water deficit by 40 rwci60 and 29 rwci80 in the 0 100 cm soil layer and collected and retained rainfall better than fsp the fsp treatment increased soc content by only 18 relative to ck while rwci60 and rwci80 increased soc by 73 and 81 respectively the rwci method could be the best choice in water limited areas as it appears to be a powerful and practical tool for overcoming drought improving deep soil water availability and supporting ecologically important hydrological processes by preventing evaporation increasing deep water permeation and storage and preventing water loss and
