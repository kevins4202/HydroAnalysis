18510,this study assessed the influence of substrate type on pollutants removal antibiotic resistance gene arg fate and bacterial community evolution in up flow microbial fuel cell constructed wetlands ucw mfc with graphite and mn ore electrode substrates better cod removal and higher bacterial community diversity and electricity generation performance were achieved in mn ore constructed ucw mfc mn however the lower concentration of sulfadiazine sdz and the total abundances of args were obtained in the effluent in the graphite constructed ucw mfc s which may be related to higher graphite adsorption and filter capacity notably both reactors can remove more than 97 8 of ciprofloxacin in addition significant negative correlations were observed between sdz cod concentration arg abundances and bacterial a diversity indices the lefse analysis revealed significantly different bacterial communities due to the substrate differences in the two reactors and geobacter a typical model electro active bacteria eab was greatly enriched on the anode of ucw mfc mn in contrast the relative abundance of methanogens methanosaeta was inhibited picrust analysis results further demonstrated that the abundance of extracellular electron transfer related functional genes was increased but the methanogen function genes and multiple antibiotic resistance genes in ucw mfc mn anode were reduced redundancy analyses indicated that substrate type antibiotic accumulation and bacterial community were the main factors affecting args moreover the potential arg hosts and the co occurrence of args and inti1 were revealed by network analysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords up flow microbial fuel cell constructed wetland mn ore antibiotic resistance gene bacterial community bioelectricity generation 1 introduction veterinary antibiotics are generally used to promote animal growth as nutrient replacements in developing countries and most are excreted in urine due to incomplete metabolism huang et al 2017 hence their residues often range from μg l 1 to mg l 1 in aquatic environments and the residue antibiotics may lead to further prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes args by continuous selective pressure muurinen et al 2017 tran et al 2018 therefore the frequent detection of antibiotics in aquatic environments calls for urgency in developing effective and economical treatment technologies for antibiotic removal an up flow microbial fuel cell constructed wetland ucw mfc which can generate bioelectricity and remove pollutants simultaneously has been successfully used to treat municipal and refractory wastewater qiu et al 2017 fang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a however the power and current densities of ucw mfcs presented at relatively lower levels compared with traditional mfcs due to the high internal resistances and the abundance of electrochemically active bacteria eab was very low compared with traditional mfcs oon et al 2017 hartl et al 2019 wang et al 2019a additionally the competition between eab and other bacteria such as methanogens for organic matter in a ucw mfc may also be a problem that reduces system electricity generation arends et al 2014 lu et al 2015 it has been reported that the cw for wastewater treatment has been found to be an important source of greenhouse gas methane generation due to the anaerobic degradation of organic matter by methanogens mander et al 2014 lópez et al 2019 wang et al 2019b moreover the previous study has demonstrated that the increase in the abundance of eabs such as desulfuromonas geobacter and pseudomonas in a closed circuit ucw mfc can enhance the bioelectricity generation and may inhibit methanogens effectively and further reduce greenhouse gas emissions by eab enrichment fan et al 2007 arends et al 2014 wang et al 2016b song et al 2018 it has been reported that geobacter can transfer electrons to the metal oxide surface by dissimilation metal reduction processes and thus the cod consumption can be greatly enhanced izallalen et al 2008 manganese mn ores composed of abundant manganite and ferric oxides are strong oxidants with high redox potential ding et al 2015 it has been demonstrated that manganese ore has been used as the catalytic filtration medium in cw xu et al 2009 huang et al 2011 yang et al 2019 moreover the previous study has demonstrated that manganese oxide mno2 and magnetite can be used as catalysts to remove pharmaceutical compound xu et al 2018b however the use of mn ore in ucw mfcs has not been reported it was hypothesized that mn ore can be used as a potential substrate for ucw mfc graphite has high adsorptive capacities and conductivity and thus it is widely employed as electrode material for nutrient removal from wastewater moreover a previous study has reported that physical sorption was responsible for args removal in the cw chen et al 2016 in addition more sorption sites for bacterial attachment for the biodegradation process can be obtained due to good adsorption performance of graphite thus we hypothesized that using graphite as electrodes will potentially enhance the removal of aqueous phase args by electrode adsorption wastewater chemical properties such as antibiotics and organics concentration operation conditions and substrate type can affect args fates and bacterial community composition to date the effects of influent antibiotic concentration and substrate type on bacterial communities in ucw mfcs is poorly understood in addition the args fates can be greatly affected by the bacterial community composition based on the hosting relationships the response of args to bacterial community and the wastewater parameter changes in ucw mfcs should be determined the potential correlations between args and bacterial communities should also be studied the main object of this study was to investigate the nutrient and target antibiotic sulfadiazine sdz and ciprofloxacin cip removal args evolution and electricity generation characteristics for graphite or mn ore constructed ucw mfcs whether mn ore can enhance performance of pollutants removal and electricity generation by enriching eabs was determined then the variation in dominant bacteria methanogen populations eab communities and potential arg host bacteria were studied third the contributions of environmental factors and bacterial community composition to the variations in args were revealed specifically the abundances of multiple antibiotic resistance genes methane monooxygenase and the functional gene for extracellular electron transfer eet were predicted by picrust analysis to further demonstrate the results 2 materials and methods 2 1 ucw mfcs setup as shown in fig 1 lab scale vertical ucw mfcs filled by graphite and mn ore as electrode substrates ucw mfc s and ucw mfc mn with identical dimensions and configurations were setup using cylinder containers inner diameter of 20 cm and height of 38 cm the water inlet was at the bottom of the reactor and the simulated wastewater was pumped into the reactor in a continuous upflow mode reactors were filled to a height of 18 cm with gravel 6 8 mm in diameter support at the bottom of the reactor carbon fibre felt 2 mm thickness attached to the stainless steel wire mesh was selected as the anode and cathode materials the spacing of the electrodes was 19 cm the anode and cathode were connected with an external resistor 1000ω made of titanium wire graphite particles 2 5 mm and manganese ore particles 4 8 mm were filled in the electrode layers of ucw mfc s and ucw mfc mn respectively it should be pointed out that the selected sizes of the substrates were the most widely used in wastewater treatment industry xu et al 2009 srivastava et al 2015 the anode layer and the cathode layer heights were 10 and 3 cm respectively the middle layer between the anode layer and the cathode layer was filled with gravel and the corresponding height was 7 cm the acorus calamus was planted on the cathode of the ucw mfc after culture for one month with a density of 3 plants per reactor the sampling ports of the anode and cathode were 28 cm and 38 cm respectively above the bottom of the reactor 2 2 inoculation and operation of the reactors the ucw mfc reactors wrapped with black shading membranes were placed in the laboratory both of the reactors were operated at controlled temperature of 25 30 c during the reactor start up both of the anode and cathode substrates pre treated by mixing with sludge were introduced into the ucw mfcs after that the 1 5 l mixture of anaerobic and aerobic sludge 1 1 ratio 15 g l 1 collected from municipal wastewater treatment plants nanjing china was used to inoculate the anode substrates in each reactor the operation conditions mass of substrates and volume and the mass of the inoculated sludge kept the same stimulated wastewater was pumped into the reactors at a hydraulic retention time of 2 5 days during the inoculation and operation periods the composition of the stimulated wastewater is as follows glucose 200 mg l 1 nh4cl 25 mg l 1 kh2po4 3h2o 2 mg l 1 and some trace elements as previous reported xu et al 2018a when the output voltage was stable the two operation stages of the ucw mfc were investigated 1 first 2 mg l 1 sdz and 2 mg l 1 cip were added to the influent of the two reactors and the reactors were continuously operated for 60 days with glucose concentration of 200 mg l 1 the physicochemical properties of sdz and cip are shown in table s1 2 glucose concentration levels were increased gradually from 200 to 600 mg l 1 in the influent at a rate of 100 mg l 1 every 20 days effluent samples from the anode and cathode were collected on day 20 40 60 80 100 120 and 140 and the corresponding anode and cathode substrate samples were collected on days 60 100 and 140 in triplicate the environmental conditions and the reactors were in a stable state when the reactors were in continuous flow therefore the sampling period of 20 days was selected 2 3 analytical methodology 2 3 1 water quality determination and antibiotic mass accumulation in the substrates during the operational period 50 ml effluent samples and 10 g substrate samples were collected at each sampling point the same sampling process was repeated for three times each three samples were pooled and the resulting mixing samples to analyse the concentration and mass accumulation of target pollutant the concentrations of cod and nh4 n were measured by standard methods american public health association 1995 the antibiotic concentrations in the effluents were determined using lc ms ms agilent g6410b usa based on the methods described in supplementary text s1 and the optimal mass spectrum parameters was shown in table s2 the mn2 concentration in the effluent was determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry aa6880 schimadzu japan the antibiotics in the anode substrate layers were extracted in duplicate based on the method described in a previous study with some modifications yan et al 2014 a brief description is provided in the supporting information see supplementary text 2 the target pollutant concentrations were tested in triplicate 2 3 2 dna extraction and arg quantification the anode and cathode effluent samples 100 ml and the corresponding substrate layers samples 2 g were collected on days 60 100 and 140 and the corresponding effluent samples were filtered with a 0 22 μm filter then the filter and substrate layer samples were extracted for dna after freeze drying using the fast dna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa based on the instructions of the kit 16s rrna gene the integrase gene inti and four args including suli sulii sulfonamide resistance genes qnrs and acc 6 ib cr quinolone resistance genes were quantified by quantitative pcr qpcr these genes were frequently detected in wastewater zhao et al 2017 he et al 2018 the reaction system for q pcr and reaction procedure are shown in text s3 all the primer sequences used for amplification were designed by wcgene biotechnology corporation shanghai china and the information of target gene length and the annealing temperatures are given in table s3 the q pcr amplification efficiencies of the different reactions were all between 90 and 110 and the correlation coefficients of the reaction standard curves were higher than 0 99 the melting curves were conducted to determine the product specificity the absolute copies of the selected genes were calculated based on the copy numbers per millilitre effluent or per gram freeze dried substrate the relative abundances ra of the target args were presented as the absolute copy number of target genes per copy of 16s rrna gene li et al 2018a 2 3 3 bacterial community analysis the substrates around the anode and cathode and the corresponding effluent samples were further analysed for bacterial community on days 60 100 and 140 the v4 hypervariable regions were amplified by pcr with the bacterial and archaeal universial primers 515f gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa and 806r ggactacnvgggtwtctaat de muinck and trosvik 2018 based on the greengenes database picrust analysis was performed to predict the kegg orthology and kegg pathways from the bacterial community data langille et al 2013 the 16s rdna v4 v5 variable regions of the methanogen genomic dna were used for pcr amplification with primers 5 tgycagccgccgcggtaa 3 524f and 5 yc cggcgttgavtccaatt 3 958r ma et al 2018 the pcr products were sequenced with an illumina miseq platform 2 4 electricity generation characteristics and electrode substrate morphology the voltage of each reactor was recorded with a data acquisition module dam 3057 art technology co ltd china to obtain the polarization curves the external electrical resistance of both reactors was changed from 5 to 100000 ω at the end of each stage the power density p mw m 2 and the current density j ma m 2 were then calculated by dividing the power ui mw and current i ma by the projected area of the anode electrode the size morphology and energy dispersive spectrometer eds analysis of graphite and mn ore substrates were characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem sigma hd germany 2 5 statistical analysis hemi 1 0 was used to draw the heatmap redundancy analysis rda was performed using canoco 4 5 network analysis was conducted using gephi 0 9 2 according to the spearman s correlation coefficients between the ras of the args and the bacterial taxa 16s rrna gene otus data p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality parameters and substrate chemical properties the pollutant removal efficiencies including cod nh4 n and the target antibiotics sdz and cip in the two reactors over 140 days of operation are shown in fig 2 the calculated removal efficiency for cod in ucw mfc s decreased from 94 0 to 74 7 during the sampling period and the cod removal rate decreased from 98 to 90 7 in ucw mfc mn fig 2a the corresponding cod loading of ucw mfc s increased gradually from 10 77 g cod m 2 d 1 to 25 69 g cod m 2 d 1 and the corresponding cod loading of ucw mfc s increased gradually from 11 23 g cod m 2 d 1 to 31 20 g cod m 2 d 1 these results indicated that ucw mfc mn had higher cod removal performance than ucw mfc s p 0 05 notably 90 7 of cod could be removed in ucw mfc mn even though the cod concentration was 600 mg l 1 in the influent while only 74 7 of cod was removed in ucw mfc s the results indicated that mn ore based ucw mfc mn had higher cod removal capacity than graphite constructed ucw mfc s however the graphite constructed ucw mfc s exhibited higher nh4 n and sdz removal rates than the mn ore constructed ucw mfc mn the average removal rates for nh4 n and sdz were 64 35 86 7 respectively in ucw mfc s and the corresponding removal rates were 54 52 and 60 5 respectively in ucw mfc mn fig 2b and c briefly graphite based reactors performed better than mn ore based reactors for the removal of the sdz the removal efficiency of sdz ranged from 95 9 to 84 9 in ucw mfc s for 140 days of operation while the removal efficiency of sdz declined from 62 8 to 46 6 in ucw mfc mn fig 2c it has been reported that a suitable cod concentration can enhance the antibiotic removal rate however the excess compounds may confine bacterial growth to a certain level thereby decreasing the sdz removal rate in cw liu et al 2019 in addition both of the reactors had high removal capacities for cip 97 8 fig 2d according to sem and eds analysis it was obvious that both the graphite and mn ore electrodes had rough surfaces figs s1a and b moreover eds analysis confirmed the presence of elements c 80 16 and o 19 84 on the graphite substrate and the presence of elements mn 27 44 fe 25 83 si 12 81 and o 33 93 on the mn ore substrate figs s1c and d mn ore may have an abundant sio2 and fe2o3 matrix speculated from eds results it has been reported that cip sorption can be enhanced due to the coexistence of divalent cations and organic matter tan et al 2015 the increasing antibiotic adsorption capacity of the metal oxide incorporated sio2 matrix may be due to the forming of inner sphere complexes between functional groups of cip and active sites of metal oxides brigante et al 2014 therefore this may be one reason for the high removal rate of cip in ucw mfc mn electrode substrates can adsorb contaminants and provide a site for bacterial attachment and the adsorption performance for the target pollutants can be influenced by the different physical and chemical properties of the electrode table 1 summarizes the chemical properties of anode substrates over all substrate type had a great impact on antibiotic accumulation the mass accumulation of antibiotics on the anode of ucw mfc s was much higher than that of ucw mfc mn p 0 05 during the 140 day run time a constant increase in target antibiotic mass accumulation was observed on the anode moreover higher cip accumulation compared with sdz was observed on anodes of the reactors these results can be attributed to the fact that different substrates have different adsorption capacities and higher distribution coefficients kd for cip than sdz contributed to cip accumulation huang et al 2017 li and zhang 2010 3 2 variations in args in the effluent and substrate layer during mesocosm experiments sulfanilamide and quinolone args were detected with high prevalence in aquatic environments li et al 2018b and all the target genes were detected in both systems notably the total ras in the effluent of ucw mfc mn was significantly higher than that in ucw mfc s fig 3 a this may be due to the higher antibiotic concentration leading to higher selective pressures on bacteria in the effluent of ucw mfc mn this result was opposite to their abundances on electrode substrates fig 3b the higher ras of the selected genes were detected on anodes of ucw mfc s which was consistent with the higher antibiotic mass accumulation on the anode a previous study found significant correlations between arg abundance and antibiotic mass concentration and the results demonstrated that the wetlands were risk creating reservoirs for args even when the antibiotic concentration in the effluent was low huang et al 2017 notably among the detected args suli qnrs and aac 6 ib cr were significantly enriched on the graphite anode these results may be related to different hosts characteristics similarly the total arg copies in most cases were amplified in the effluents of ucw mfc mn fig 4 a in general the capacity of ucw mfc s to filter out bacteria are conducive for enriching args on electrode substrates moreover it was observed that the graphite substrate constructed ucw mfc s was much more efficient for bacterial adherence than mn ore constructed ucw mfc mn an average of a 1 76 and 2 61 fold increase in total bacteria on the cathode and anode respectively of ucw mfc s was observed by quantifying 16s rrna gene copies on a per gram substrate basis due to the high adsorption performance of graphite fig s2 notably the average total arg copies on the anode of ucw mfc s were 5 4 higher than of ucw mfc mn therefore the target gene copies were enriched on the electrodes of ucw mfc s compared with that in ucw mfc mn in contrast the average total arg copies in the effluent decreased by 8 1 in the effluent of ucw mfc s compared with ucw mfc mn fig 4a the migration of the target args from planktonic phase to biofilm on the substrates has been observed previously and args carried by intestinal microorganisms are filled out easily by substrate engemann et al 2008 huang et al 2017 it has been reported that approximately two logarithmic units of e coli and salmonella in swine wastewater were removed by subsurface flow cws hill and sobsey 2001 when the target args were removed from the wastewater the args and their host bacteria were partially deposited in the substrates of ucw mfc s thus their abundances on the graphite electrodes were enhanced fig 4b 3 3 bacterial a diversity in effluent and electrode substrates species abundances estimated by the chao 1 observed species pd whole tree and shannon indices were always higher in the effluent and substrates of mn ore constructed ucw mfc mn suggesting that mn ore can enhance bacterial community diversity tables s4 and s5 a previous study showed that modified metal oxides on mfc anodes could contribute to bacterial adhesion and accelerate the eet process zhang et al 2016 therefore bacterial diversity was enhanced in addition the improved bacterial community structure with the addition of mn ore may contribute to the efficient removal of cod xie et al 2018 significant decreases in the bacterial diversity indices for electrodes and effluents were also observed when the cod concentration in the influent increased from 200 mg l 1 to 600 mg l 1 tables s4 and s5 indicating that high cod contributes to enrichment of some specific bacteria additionally higher cod concentrations may produce acidification and bacterial diversity may decrease because some bacteria may be destroyed spearman s correlation analysis showed that sdz concentrations in the effluent had significant negative correlations with α diversity indices suggesting that sdz accumulation can significantly reduce the bacterial community diversity table s6 the bacterial diversity indices exhibited similar trends with the anode substrate samples table s7 these results were demonstrated in another study which showed that the overall bacterial community structure did shift with the addition of sulphonamides guo et al 2017 the continuous accumulation of sdz on the anode significantly decreased the community diversity moreover significant negative observations were observed between most ras of the args and α diversity indices including chao1 observed species and shannon p 0 05 tables s6 and s7 therefore a significant increase in the target arg abundances may be relevant to the decrease in bacterial community diversity and bacteria with antibiotic resistance can survive in the system 3 4 bacterial β diversity in effluents and substrates and potential functional dominant microbes on anode substrates bacterial otu distribution among the substrate and effluent samples were revealed by principal co ordinates analysis pcoa fig s3 substrate samples and the corresponding effluent samples were all separated based on the influent cod concentration on the first axis indicating that cod concentration in the influent had significant impacts on the bacterial community composition hierarchical cluster analysis using the upgma clustering tree based on weighted unifrac distance at the phylum level was analysed fig 5 a a total of 18 main phyla were observed suggesting biodiversity was high on the anodes of the reactors it can be seen that the bacterial communities could be divided mainly into two groups and the samples from the graphite anode clustered apart from the mn ore constructed anode samples moreover the cod concentration in the influent had significant impacts on the bacterial community it was suggested that bacterial communities of the anode substrate were greatly affected by substrate type and cod concentration in the influent specifically proteobacteria armatimonadetes bacteroidetes dependentiae firmicutes kiritimatiellaeota lentisphaerae spirochaetes and verrucomicrobia were more abundant on the graphite substrate anode lefse algorithm results further revealed the dominant taxa that presented the main differences between mn ore and graphite anodes fig 6 a notably 56 biomarkers were found at an lda threshold of 2 0 judging by statistically significant differences p 0 05 fig 6b at the phylum level an obvious distinction was observed for example the average ra of proteobacteria on the mn ore anode was 68 54 while its abundance on the graphite anode was only 27 11 proteobacteria which is a well known eab phylum were significantly enriched in mn ore constructed anodes fig 5a moreover a previous study reported that the proteobacteria phylum has been found in many bioelectrochemical systems for treating antibiotics such as ofloxacin norfloxacin and cip yan et al 2019 in addition the average abundance of bacteroidetes on the graphite anode was 16 8 while its abundance on the mn ore anode was 5 8 firmicutes was also enriched on the anode of graphite notably the average ra of deltaproteobacteria another subgroup of proteobacteria showed it was another dominant eab class its abundance was significantly enriched in mn ore constructed ucw mfc mn 47 7 while its abundance was only 6 9 in graphite constructed ucw mfc s further genus level identification by lefse analysis showed that the model electro active geobacter belong to deltaproteobacteria was the most abundant eab in the presence of mn ore due to the existing dissimilation metal reduction processes and its average abundance was 25 7 compared with 0 9 on the graphite anode geobacter group which belongs to model electricigens can potentially divert respiratory electrons away from the anode electrode in ucw mfc corbella vidal et al 2017 moreover geobacter has bee reported to conserve energy by coupling the oxidation of organics to the reduction of metal oxide caccavo et al 1994 the previous study demonstrated that the relative abundances of geobacter on carbon fiber felt foamed nickel and stainless steel mesh or graphite rod anode constructed ucw mfc were all less than 1 treating municipal wastewater wang et al 2016a another study has also reported that the abundances of geobacter desulfovibrio and bacillus were all less than 1 due to the existence of completion with the fermentation bacteria xu et al 2018a these results were consistent with our study showing that dissimilatory metal reduction bacteria geobacter was hard to be enriched in ucw mfc the result also demonstrated that some other well known eabs such as desulfobulbus which has been shown to respire electrons by oxidizing pyruvate were also enriched on mn ore anode lu et al 2015 additionally eubacterium spp which can anaerobically transform various oxygen containing heterocyclic aromatic compounds was enriched on mn ore anode yan et al 2018 mn oxides have been shown to reduce to mn ii by a dissimilated metal reduction reaction and mn ii can be further oxidized to mn oxides under oxygen conditions xie et al 2018 the overall mn2 concentration in the effluent was constant and the average mn2 concentration in the anode effluent of ucw mfc mn was 2 54 mg l 1 indicating that cod degradation coupled to mn ore reduction may have occurred in addition the mn2 dropped to a minimum average 54 μg l 1 in the cathode effluent due to oxidation effects the mn ii can be formed on oxygen deficient anode and it may be further be oxidized into mno2 at cathode ra of gammaproteobacteria which is involved in manganese cycling was significantly enriched on the mn ore anode on day 140 blöthe et al 2015 fig s4 the ra of gammaproteobacteria was 45 on the mn ore anode the more abundant gammaproteobacteria provided evidence that cod degradation coupled to mn ore reduction may exist in mn ore ucw mfcs moreover these results indicated that a mn cycle existed and the mn cycle contributed to the pollutant removal 3 5 the abundances of the main methanogens in the systems there is limited information related to the systemic methanogen population research in ucw mfcs lu et al 2015 high throughput sequencing results showed that methanogen communities on the anode were observed hydrogenotrophic methanogens orders methanobacteria and methannomicrobia strictly acetotrophic methanogens family methanosaetaceae and mixotrophic methanogens family methanosarcinaceae were found on the anode the ras of methanogens were compared between the mn ore and graphite constructed anodes the identified main methanogens on both electrode substrates were methanosaeta methanosphaera methanosarcina and methanobacterium fig 5b it is well known that methanosaeta and methanosarcina species are capable of producing methane via direct interspecies electron transfer zhao et al 2016 a previous study reported that methanogens can compete with eabs for carbon sources on the anode and thus bioelectricity generation was decreased blöthe et al 2015 notably higher ra of methanosaeta 39 7 was detected on the graphite anode compared to the mn ore anode 24 7 and the detected total ra of methanogens was also high on the graphite anode these results may be because methanogens can compete with eabs for electron donors the mn ore anode can increase the growth of eabs and further inhibit the growth of methanogens picrust results also revealed the ra of methanogen gene families the ra of methane monooxygenase k08684 on the graphite anode increased from 8 28 10 5 to 4 52 10 4 and the ra value increased from 3 34 10 5 to 6 08 10 5 on the mn ore anode with the cod concentration increase fig 5c the ra of methane monooxygenase on the graphite anode was always significantly higher than on the mn ore anode on the contrary the eet funcational genes were enriched on the mn ore anode compared to the graphite anode fig 5d these results suggested that mn ore based ucw mfc mn significantly inhibited methanogens but increased the abundance of exoelectrogen and the functional genes related to eet furthermore picrust predicted metagenomes further demonstrated that the ras of multiple antibiotic resistance genes k05595 on the anode of ucw mfc s were between 0 00041 and 0 00055 notably the ra value for ucw mfc mn was between 0 00037 and 0 00043 which was lower than that for ucw mfc s 3 6 rda analysis between bacterial community wastewater properties and args prevalence in this study rda analysis was used to reveal the relationships between the ra of the args major phyla and the main environmental factors the environmental factors analysis for the effluent comprised the substrate type and antibiotic cod and nh4 n concentrations the bacterial communities included the main phyla bacteroidetes lentisphaerae chloroflexi cyanobacteria patescibacteria and proteobacteria fig 7 a notably the environmental factors sdz cip cod and nh4 n concentrations and substrate type explained 59 5 of the arg variation and the percentage of bacterial phyla explained 35 3 fig 7a the capacity of the substrate to filter out antibiotic and bacteria contributed greatly to the variation of args among the environmental factors substrate type explained 19 9 of changes in args determining that the substrate type had significant impacts on args distribution in effluent among the variables considered the sdz and cip significantly explained most changes 32 8 in the total changes of args fig 7a notably arg levels were always correlated with the abundance of related antibiotics indicating that the removal and accumulation of antibiotics and args can co occur fig 7a the higher ra of the suli and acc 6 ib cr genes were detected in the effluent this may be due to the presence of integrons based on a previous study he et al 2017 the redundancy analysis results also showed that the arg abundance was affected by changes in the bacterial community it was observed that bacteroiodetes and chloroflexi were negatively affected by all target antibiotics and args fig 7a additionally lentisphaerae had positive correlations with suli inti and acc 6 ib cr and proteobacteria and cyanobacteria were correlated with all detected target args according to the rda results fig 7a these results suggested that the evolution of arg host bacteria was a critical factor that determining the changes in args significant positive correlations between sdz mass cip mass and the ra of args on anodes were also revealed fig 7b the selected environmental factors explained 91 of the total arg change rda results also demonstrated that the antibiotic mass accumulation and substrate type had significant impacts on arg distribution and bacterial community distribution characteristics on the anodes 3 7 revealing the correlation between args and their potential hosts by network analysis network analysis further revealed the potential host bacteria at the genus level in the effluent and on the electrodes fig 8 the potential host bacteria for each arg are listed tables s8 and s9 node colours denoted args inti and the potential host bacteria a connection represented a significant positive correlation it can be found that 63 and 36 bacterial taxa at the genus level were significantly correlated with the detected args in effluent and the electrodes samples respectively p 0 05 the network comprised of four args one integron gene inti and the potential args hosts fig 8 significant positive correlations were detected between qnrs and sulii genes in the effluent fig 8a the network relationship on the substrate was relatively simpler than in the effluent significant positive correlations were observed between the ra of sulii acc 6 ib cr and qnrs on electrodes fig 8b moreover inti had significant positive correlations with suli on the electrode the co occurrence of different args was observed due to the strong positive correlations between multiple args the results further demonstrated that these args had the same host bacteria and positive correlations between their bacterial hosts were observed for example there was a significant positive correlation between acc 6 ib cr and qnrs on substrate samples and the co occurrence of these genes was detected in aeromonas desulfovibrio parcubacteria group bacterium adurb bin326 desulfomicrobium and clostridium sensu stricto 8 fig 8b the shift in the potential hosts was a major reason for the args alteration for example the more dominant potential hosts desulfobulbus resulted in a higher abundance of inti on graphite substrates moreover the higher abundances of the dominant potential hosts dysgonomonas and klebsiella for acc 6 ib cr and tolumonas desulfovibrio and wchb1 32 qnrs on electrodes resulted in higher ras of the args on graphite electrodes similarly the co occurrence of the potential hosts was observed in the effluent the dominant potential hosts for sulii and qnrs were allorhizobium neorhizobium pararhizobium rhizobium and wchb1 32 based on network analysis and spearman correlation analysis heatmap fig 8a and fig s5 in addition the potential hosts for inti and qnrs were acetobacteroides and caulobacter and the potential hosts for qnrs and acc 6 ib cr were aeromonas and desulfovibrio 3 8 bioelectricity generation characteristic in two ucw mfcs the average voltage of ucw mfc s and ucw mfc mn reactors for 140 days of operation were 311 mv and 511mv respectively fig s6 with the increase in the cod concentration in the influent the obtained voltage remained stable in ucw mfc mn while the voltage declined in ucw mfc s this may be because the high organic concentration cannot be completely oxidized in the anodic compartment and flowed into the cathode compartment which became anaerobic and deteriorated the cathode performance of the ucw mfc s wang et al 2019c notably mn ore based ucw mfc mn exhibit a higher ability for cod removal and produced high bioelectricity even though the internal resistance of ucw mfc mn was higher than that of ucw mfc s the highest power density increased first and then decreased in ucw mfc mn fig s7 however the cathode potential of ucw mfc s dropped rapidly and the highest power density continuously declined in ucw mfc s therefore these results suggest that the cod concentration in the influent must be controlled within a certain range to obtain the high electricity generation performance the average highest power density of ucw mfc mn was 9 70 mw m 2 which was 3 34 times than that of ucw mfc s 2 90 mw m 2 fig s7 moreover ucw mfc mn achieved a maximum current density of 49 25 ma m 2 which was higher than the maximum current density produced by ucw mfc s 33 09 ma m 2 fig s7 the performance of the cathode played an important role in determining the electricity generation of the system compared with the graphite cathode the mn ore cathode played a prominent role in reactor electricity generation performance the cathode potential in ucw mfc mn was 250 350 mv during the experiment a previous study demonstrated that a mno2 modified cathode can improve electricity generation performance due to cathode catalysis effects yang et al 2016 these findings suggested that the mn ore as the electrode substrate is important for enhancing electricity generation the anode potential of both reactors was not significantly affected during the reactors running and this may be related to the relatively low mass accumulation of antibiotic the deterioration of electricity generation performance of ucw mfc s was mainly due to the deterioration of cathode performance mn ore constructed ucw mfc can enhance cod removal and electricity generation performance and it is also practical when it is used to treat real wastewater not only is its cod treatment efficiency better but the mn ore has the significant price advantage compared with graphite the costs of two materials based on per cubic meter anodic compartment and per milliwatt produced was compared in table s10 it was shown that mn ore has lower price per milliwatt produced however removal rate of sdz and args in mn ore constructed ucw mfc should be intensified therefore it is necessary to explore other ways to enhance the antibiotic and args removal in ucw mfc mn for example the combination electrode with respective advantages should be developed to solve this problem in the furture 4 conclusions our results demonstrated that the abundance of eabs and the functional genes of eet were greatly enriched and the abundances of methanogens and corresponding functional genes as well as multiple antibiotic resistance genes were inhibited in mn ore constructed ucw mfc mn anode the results suggested that the methanogens may be inhibited because eabs can compete with methanogens on the anode due to the existence of dissimilation metal reduction processes higher average output voltage power and current density were obtained in ucw mfc mn during the 140 days of operation in addition cod removal was significantly enhanced in ucw mfc mn during the whole experimental process the continuous accumulation of antibiotics was observed on electrodes while the reactors were running and the stronger antibiotic and args adsorption capacities were observed in graphite constructed ucw mfc s thus low concentrations of antibiotics and low abundances of args were obtained in the effluent of ucw mfc s rda analysis showed that substrate type antibiotic accumulation and bacterial community were the main factors affecting the variations in args in addition the co occurrence of args inti and some potential antibiotic resistant bacteria revealed by network analysis indicated they can spread together to increase the environmental risk notes the authors declare that they do not have any competing

18510,this study assessed the influence of substrate type on pollutants removal antibiotic resistance gene arg fate and bacterial community evolution in up flow microbial fuel cell constructed wetlands ucw mfc with graphite and mn ore electrode substrates better cod removal and higher bacterial community diversity and electricity generation performance were achieved in mn ore constructed ucw mfc mn however the lower concentration of sulfadiazine sdz and the total abundances of args were obtained in the effluent in the graphite constructed ucw mfc s which may be related to higher graphite adsorption and filter capacity notably both reactors can remove more than 97 8 of ciprofloxacin in addition significant negative correlations were observed between sdz cod concentration arg abundances and bacterial a diversity indices the lefse analysis revealed significantly different bacterial communities due to the substrate differences in the two reactors and geobacter a typical model electro active bacteria eab was greatly enriched on the anode of ucw mfc mn in contrast the relative abundance of methanogens methanosaeta was inhibited picrust analysis results further demonstrated that the abundance of extracellular electron transfer related functional genes was increased but the methanogen function genes and multiple antibiotic resistance genes in ucw mfc mn anode were reduced redundancy analyses indicated that substrate type antibiotic accumulation and bacterial community were the main factors affecting args moreover the potential arg hosts and the co occurrence of args and inti1 were revealed by network analysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords up flow microbial fuel cell constructed wetland mn ore antibiotic resistance gene bacterial community bioelectricity generation 1 introduction veterinary antibiotics are generally used to promote animal growth as nutrient replacements in developing countries and most are excreted in urine due to incomplete metabolism huang et al 2017 hence their residues often range from μg l 1 to mg l 1 in aquatic environments and the residue antibiotics may lead to further prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes args by continuous selective pressure muurinen et al 2017 tran et al 2018 therefore the frequent detection of antibiotics in aquatic environments calls for urgency in developing effective and economical treatment technologies for antibiotic removal an up flow microbial fuel cell constructed wetland ucw mfc which can generate bioelectricity and remove pollutants simultaneously has been successfully used to treat municipal and refractory wastewater qiu et al 2017 fang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a however the power and current densities of ucw mfcs presented at relatively lower levels compared with traditional mfcs due to the high internal resistances and the abundance of electrochemically active bacteria eab was very low compared with traditional mfcs oon et al 2017 hartl et al 2019 wang et al 2019a additionally the competition between eab and other bacteria such as methanogens for organic matter in a ucw mfc may also be a problem that reduces system electricity generation arends et al 2014 lu et al 2015 it has been reported that the cw for wastewater treatment has been found to be an important source of greenhouse gas methane generation due to the anaerobic degradation of organic matter by methanogens mander et al 2014 lópez et al 2019 wang et al 2019b moreover the previous study has demonstrated that the increase in the abundance of eabs such as desulfuromonas geobacter and pseudomonas in a closed circuit ucw mfc can enhance the bioelectricity generation and may inhibit methanogens effectively and further reduce greenhouse gas emissions by eab enrichment fan et al 2007 arends et al 2014 wang et al 2016b song et al 2018 it has been reported that geobacter can transfer electrons to the metal oxide surface by dissimilation metal reduction processes and thus the cod consumption can be greatly enhanced izallalen et al 2008 manganese mn ores composed of abundant manganite and ferric oxides are strong oxidants with high redox potential ding et al 2015 it has been demonstrated that manganese ore has been used as the catalytic filtration medium in cw xu et al 2009 huang et al 2011 yang et al 2019 moreover the previous study has demonstrated that manganese oxide mno2 and magnetite can be used as catalysts to remove pharmaceutical compound xu et al 2018b however the use of mn ore in ucw mfcs has not been reported it was hypothesized that mn ore can be used as a potential substrate for ucw mfc graphite has high adsorptive capacities and conductivity and thus it is widely employed as electrode material for nutrient removal from wastewater moreover a previous study has reported that physical sorption was responsible for args removal in the cw chen et al 2016 in addition more sorption sites for bacterial attachment for the biodegradation process can be obtained due to good adsorption performance of graphite thus we hypothesized that using graphite as electrodes will potentially enhance the removal of aqueous phase args by electrode adsorption wastewater chemical properties such as antibiotics and organics concentration operation conditions and substrate type can affect args fates and bacterial community composition to date the effects of influent antibiotic concentration and substrate type on bacterial communities in ucw mfcs is poorly understood in addition the args fates can be greatly affected by the bacterial community composition based on the hosting relationships the response of args to bacterial community and the wastewater parameter changes in ucw mfcs should be determined the potential correlations between args and bacterial communities should also be studied the main object of this study was to investigate the nutrient and target antibiotic sulfadiazine sdz and ciprofloxacin cip removal args evolution and electricity generation characteristics for graphite or mn ore constructed ucw mfcs whether mn ore can enhance performance of pollutants removal and electricity generation by enriching eabs was determined then the variation in dominant bacteria methanogen populations eab communities and potential arg host bacteria were studied third the contributions of environmental factors and bacterial community composition to the variations in args were revealed specifically the abundances of multiple antibiotic resistance genes methane monooxygenase and the functional gene for extracellular electron transfer eet were predicted by picrust analysis to further demonstrate the results 2 materials and methods 2 1 ucw mfcs setup as shown in fig 1 lab scale vertical ucw mfcs filled by graphite and mn ore as electrode substrates ucw mfc s and ucw mfc mn with identical dimensions and configurations were setup using cylinder containers inner diameter of 20 cm and height of 38 cm the water inlet was at the bottom of the reactor and the simulated wastewater was pumped into the reactor in a continuous upflow mode reactors were filled to a height of 18 cm with gravel 6 8 mm in diameter support at the bottom of the reactor carbon fibre felt 2 mm thickness attached to the stainless steel wire mesh was selected as the anode and cathode materials the spacing of the electrodes was 19 cm the anode and cathode were connected with an external resistor 1000ω made of titanium wire graphite particles 2 5 mm and manganese ore particles 4 8 mm were filled in the electrode layers of ucw mfc s and ucw mfc mn respectively it should be pointed out that the selected sizes of the substrates were the most widely used in wastewater treatment industry xu et al 2009 srivastava et al 2015 the anode layer and the cathode layer heights were 10 and 3 cm respectively the middle layer between the anode layer and the cathode layer was filled with gravel and the corresponding height was 7 cm the acorus calamus was planted on the cathode of the ucw mfc after culture for one month with a density of 3 plants per reactor the sampling ports of the anode and cathode were 28 cm and 38 cm respectively above the bottom of the reactor 2 2 inoculation and operation of the reactors the ucw mfc reactors wrapped with black shading membranes were placed in the laboratory both of the reactors were operated at controlled temperature of 25 30 c during the reactor start up both of the anode and cathode substrates pre treated by mixing with sludge were introduced into the ucw mfcs after that the 1 5 l mixture of anaerobic and aerobic sludge 1 1 ratio 15 g l 1 collected from municipal wastewater treatment plants nanjing china was used to inoculate the anode substrates in each reactor the operation conditions mass of substrates and volume and the mass of the inoculated sludge kept the same stimulated wastewater was pumped into the reactors at a hydraulic retention time of 2 5 days during the inoculation and operation periods the composition of the stimulated wastewater is as follows glucose 200 mg l 1 nh4cl 25 mg l 1 kh2po4 3h2o 2 mg l 1 and some trace elements as previous reported xu et al 2018a when the output voltage was stable the two operation stages of the ucw mfc were investigated 1 first 2 mg l 1 sdz and 2 mg l 1 cip were added to the influent of the two reactors and the reactors were continuously operated for 60 days with glucose concentration of 200 mg l 1 the physicochemical properties of sdz and cip are shown in table s1 2 glucose concentration levels were increased gradually from 200 to 600 mg l 1 in the influent at a rate of 100 mg l 1 every 20 days effluent samples from the anode and cathode were collected on day 20 40 60 80 100 120 and 140 and the corresponding anode and cathode substrate samples were collected on days 60 100 and 140 in triplicate the environmental conditions and the reactors were in a stable state when the reactors were in continuous flow therefore the sampling period of 20 days was selected 2 3 analytical methodology 2 3 1 water quality determination and antibiotic mass accumulation in the substrates during the operational period 50 ml effluent samples and 10 g substrate samples were collected at each sampling point the same sampling process was repeated for three times each three samples were pooled and the resulting mixing samples to analyse the concentration and mass accumulation of target pollutant the concentrations of cod and nh4 n were measured by standard methods american public health association 1995 the antibiotic concentrations in the effluents were determined using lc ms ms agilent g6410b usa based on the methods described in supplementary text s1 and the optimal mass spectrum parameters was shown in table s2 the mn2 concentration in the effluent was determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry aa6880 schimadzu japan the antibiotics in the anode substrate layers were extracted in duplicate based on the method described in a previous study with some modifications yan et al 2014 a brief description is provided in the supporting information see supplementary text 2 the target pollutant concentrations were tested in triplicate 2 3 2 dna extraction and arg quantification the anode and cathode effluent samples 100 ml and the corresponding substrate layers samples 2 g were collected on days 60 100 and 140 and the corresponding effluent samples were filtered with a 0 22 μm filter then the filter and substrate layer samples were extracted for dna after freeze drying using the fast dna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa based on the instructions of the kit 16s rrna gene the integrase gene inti and four args including suli sulii sulfonamide resistance genes qnrs and acc 6 ib cr quinolone resistance genes were quantified by quantitative pcr qpcr these genes were frequently detected in wastewater zhao et al 2017 he et al 2018 the reaction system for q pcr and reaction procedure are shown in text s3 all the primer sequences used for amplification were designed by wcgene biotechnology corporation shanghai china and the information of target gene length and the annealing temperatures are given in table s3 the q pcr amplification efficiencies of the different reactions were all between 90 and 110 and the correlation coefficients of the reaction standard curves were higher than 0 99 the melting curves were conducted to determine the product specificity the absolute copies of the selected genes were calculated based on the copy numbers per millilitre effluent or per gram freeze dried substrate the relative abundances ra of the target args were presented as the absolute copy number of target genes per copy of 16s rrna gene li et al 2018a 2 3 3 bacterial community analysis the substrates around the anode and cathode and the corresponding effluent samples were further analysed for bacterial community on days 60 100 and 140 the v4 hypervariable regions were amplified by pcr with the bacterial and archaeal universial primers 515f gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa and 806r ggactacnvgggtwtctaat de muinck and trosvik 2018 based on the greengenes database picrust analysis was performed to predict the kegg orthology and kegg pathways from the bacterial community data langille et al 2013 the 16s rdna v4 v5 variable regions of the methanogen genomic dna were used for pcr amplification with primers 5 tgycagccgccgcggtaa 3 524f and 5 yc cggcgttgavtccaatt 3 958r ma et al 2018 the pcr products were sequenced with an illumina miseq platform 2 4 electricity generation characteristics and electrode substrate morphology the voltage of each reactor was recorded with a data acquisition module dam 3057 art technology co ltd china to obtain the polarization curves the external electrical resistance of both reactors was changed from 5 to 100000 ω at the end of each stage the power density p mw m 2 and the current density j ma m 2 were then calculated by dividing the power ui mw and current i ma by the projected area of the anode electrode the size morphology and energy dispersive spectrometer eds analysis of graphite and mn ore substrates were characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem sigma hd germany 2 5 statistical analysis hemi 1 0 was used to draw the heatmap redundancy analysis rda was performed using canoco 4 5 network analysis was conducted using gephi 0 9 2 according to the spearman s correlation coefficients between the ras of the args and the bacterial taxa 16s rrna gene otus data p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality parameters and substrate chemical properties the pollutant removal efficiencies including cod nh4 n and the target antibiotics sdz and cip in the two reactors over 140 days of operation are shown in fig 2 the calculated removal efficiency for cod in ucw mfc s decreased from 94 0 to 74 7 during the sampling period and the cod removal rate decreased from 98 to 90 7 in ucw mfc mn fig 2a the corresponding cod loading of ucw mfc s increased gradually from 10 77 g cod m 2 d 1 to 25 69 g cod m 2 d 1 and the corresponding cod loading of ucw mfc s increased gradually from 11 23 g cod m 2 d 1 to 31 20 g cod m 2 d 1 these results indicated that ucw mfc mn had higher cod removal performance than ucw mfc s p 0 05 notably 90 7 of cod could be removed in ucw mfc mn even though the cod concentration was 600 mg l 1 in the influent while only 74 7 of cod was removed in ucw mfc s the results indicated that mn ore based ucw mfc mn had higher cod removal capacity than graphite constructed ucw mfc s however the graphite constructed ucw mfc s exhibited higher nh4 n and sdz removal rates than the mn ore constructed ucw mfc mn the average removal rates for nh4 n and sdz were 64 35 86 7 respectively in ucw mfc s and the corresponding removal rates were 54 52 and 60 5 respectively in ucw mfc mn fig 2b and c briefly graphite based reactors performed better than mn ore based reactors for the removal of the sdz the removal efficiency of sdz ranged from 95 9 to 84 9 in ucw mfc s for 140 days of operation while the removal efficiency of sdz declined from 62 8 to 46 6 in ucw mfc mn fig 2c it has been reported that a suitable cod concentration can enhance the antibiotic removal rate however the excess compounds may confine bacterial growth to a certain level thereby decreasing the sdz removal rate in cw liu et al 2019 in addition both of the reactors had high removal capacities for cip 97 8 fig 2d according to sem and eds analysis it was obvious that both the graphite and mn ore electrodes had rough surfaces figs s1a and b moreover eds analysis confirmed the presence of elements c 80 16 and o 19 84 on the graphite substrate and the presence of elements mn 27 44 fe 25 83 si 12 81 and o 33 93 on the mn ore substrate figs s1c and d mn ore may have an abundant sio2 and fe2o3 matrix speculated from eds results it has been reported that cip sorption can be enhanced due to the coexistence of divalent cations and organic matter tan et al 2015 the increasing antibiotic adsorption capacity of the metal oxide incorporated sio2 matrix may be due to the forming of inner sphere complexes between functional groups of cip and active sites of metal oxides brigante et al 2014 therefore this may be one reason for the high removal rate of cip in ucw mfc mn electrode substrates can adsorb contaminants and provide a site for bacterial attachment and the adsorption performance for the target pollutants can be influenced by the different physical and chemical properties of the electrode table 1 summarizes the chemical properties of anode substrates over all substrate type had a great impact on antibiotic accumulation the mass accumulation of antibiotics on the anode of ucw mfc s was much higher than that of ucw mfc mn p 0 05 during the 140 day run time a constant increase in target antibiotic mass accumulation was observed on the anode moreover higher cip accumulation compared with sdz was observed on anodes of the reactors these results can be attributed to the fact that different substrates have different adsorption capacities and higher distribution coefficients kd for cip than sdz contributed to cip accumulation huang et al 2017 li and zhang 2010 3 2 variations in args in the effluent and substrate layer during mesocosm experiments sulfanilamide and quinolone args were detected with high prevalence in aquatic environments li et al 2018b and all the target genes were detected in both systems notably the total ras in the effluent of ucw mfc mn was significantly higher than that in ucw mfc s fig 3 a this may be due to the higher antibiotic concentration leading to higher selective pressures on bacteria in the effluent of ucw mfc mn this result was opposite to their abundances on electrode substrates fig 3b the higher ras of the selected genes were detected on anodes of ucw mfc s which was consistent with the higher antibiotic mass accumulation on the anode a previous study found significant correlations between arg abundance and antibiotic mass concentration and the results demonstrated that the wetlands were risk creating reservoirs for args even when the antibiotic concentration in the effluent was low huang et al 2017 notably among the detected args suli qnrs and aac 6 ib cr were significantly enriched on the graphite anode these results may be related to different hosts characteristics similarly the total arg copies in most cases were amplified in the effluents of ucw mfc mn fig 4 a in general the capacity of ucw mfc s to filter out bacteria are conducive for enriching args on electrode substrates moreover it was observed that the graphite substrate constructed ucw mfc s was much more efficient for bacterial adherence than mn ore constructed ucw mfc mn an average of a 1 76 and 2 61 fold increase in total bacteria on the cathode and anode respectively of ucw mfc s was observed by quantifying 16s rrna gene copies on a per gram substrate basis due to the high adsorption performance of graphite fig s2 notably the average total arg copies on the anode of ucw mfc s were 5 4 higher than of ucw mfc mn therefore the target gene copies were enriched on the electrodes of ucw mfc s compared with that in ucw mfc mn in contrast the average total arg copies in the effluent decreased by 8 1 in the effluent of ucw mfc s compared with ucw mfc mn fig 4a the migration of the target args from planktonic phase to biofilm on the substrates has been observed previously and args carried by intestinal microorganisms are filled out easily by substrate engemann et al 2008 huang et al 2017 it has been reported that approximately two logarithmic units of e coli and salmonella in swine wastewater were removed by subsurface flow cws hill and sobsey 2001 when the target args were removed from the wastewater the args and their host bacteria were partially deposited in the substrates of ucw mfc s thus their abundances on the graphite electrodes were enhanced fig 4b 3 3 bacterial a diversity in effluent and electrode substrates species abundances estimated by the chao 1 observed species pd whole tree and shannon indices were always higher in the effluent and substrates of mn ore constructed ucw mfc mn suggesting that mn ore can enhance bacterial community diversity tables s4 and s5 a previous study showed that modified metal oxides on mfc anodes could contribute to bacterial adhesion and accelerate the eet process zhang et al 2016 therefore bacterial diversity was enhanced in addition the improved bacterial community structure with the addition of mn ore may contribute to the efficient removal of cod xie et al 2018 significant decreases in the bacterial diversity indices for electrodes and effluents were also observed when the cod concentration in the influent increased from 200 mg l 1 to 600 mg l 1 tables s4 and s5 indicating that high cod contributes to enrichment of some specific bacteria additionally higher cod concentrations may produce acidification and bacterial diversity may decrease because some bacteria may be destroyed spearman s correlation analysis showed that sdz concentrations in the effluent had significant negative correlations with α diversity indices suggesting that sdz accumulation can significantly reduce the bacterial community diversity table s6 the bacterial diversity indices exhibited similar trends with the anode substrate samples table s7 these results were demonstrated in another study which showed that the overall bacterial community structure did shift with the addition of sulphonamides guo et al 2017 the continuous accumulation of sdz on the anode significantly decreased the community diversity moreover significant negative observations were observed between most ras of the args and α diversity indices including chao1 observed species and shannon p 0 05 tables s6 and s7 therefore a significant increase in the target arg abundances may be relevant to the decrease in bacterial community diversity and bacteria with antibiotic resistance can survive in the system 3 4 bacterial β diversity in effluents and substrates and potential functional dominant microbes on anode substrates bacterial otu distribution among the substrate and effluent samples were revealed by principal co ordinates analysis pcoa fig s3 substrate samples and the corresponding effluent samples were all separated based on the influent cod concentration on the first axis indicating that cod concentration in the influent had significant impacts on the bacterial community composition hierarchical cluster analysis using the upgma clustering tree based on weighted unifrac distance at the phylum level was analysed fig 5 a a total of 18 main phyla were observed suggesting biodiversity was high on the anodes of the reactors it can be seen that the bacterial communities could be divided mainly into two groups and the samples from the graphite anode clustered apart from the mn ore constructed anode samples moreover the cod concentration in the influent had significant impacts on the bacterial community it was suggested that bacterial communities of the anode substrate were greatly affected by substrate type and cod concentration in the influent specifically proteobacteria armatimonadetes bacteroidetes dependentiae firmicutes kiritimatiellaeota lentisphaerae spirochaetes and verrucomicrobia were more abundant on the graphite substrate anode lefse algorithm results further revealed the dominant taxa that presented the main differences between mn ore and graphite anodes fig 6 a notably 56 biomarkers were found at an lda threshold of 2 0 judging by statistically significant differences p 0 05 fig 6b at the phylum level an obvious distinction was observed for example the average ra of proteobacteria on the mn ore anode was 68 54 while its abundance on the graphite anode was only 27 11 proteobacteria which is a well known eab phylum were significantly enriched in mn ore constructed anodes fig 5a moreover a previous study reported that the proteobacteria phylum has been found in many bioelectrochemical systems for treating antibiotics such as ofloxacin norfloxacin and cip yan et al 2019 in addition the average abundance of bacteroidetes on the graphite anode was 16 8 while its abundance on the mn ore anode was 5 8 firmicutes was also enriched on the anode of graphite notably the average ra of deltaproteobacteria another subgroup of proteobacteria showed it was another dominant eab class its abundance was significantly enriched in mn ore constructed ucw mfc mn 47 7 while its abundance was only 6 9 in graphite constructed ucw mfc s further genus level identification by lefse analysis showed that the model electro active geobacter belong to deltaproteobacteria was the most abundant eab in the presence of mn ore due to the existing dissimilation metal reduction processes and its average abundance was 25 7 compared with 0 9 on the graphite anode geobacter group which belongs to model electricigens can potentially divert respiratory electrons away from the anode electrode in ucw mfc corbella vidal et al 2017 moreover geobacter has bee reported to conserve energy by coupling the oxidation of organics to the reduction of metal oxide caccavo et al 1994 the previous study demonstrated that the relative abundances of geobacter on carbon fiber felt foamed nickel and stainless steel mesh or graphite rod anode constructed ucw mfc were all less than 1 treating municipal wastewater wang et al 2016a another study has also reported that the abundances of geobacter desulfovibrio and bacillus were all less than 1 due to the existence of completion with the fermentation bacteria xu et al 2018a these results were consistent with our study showing that dissimilatory metal reduction bacteria geobacter was hard to be enriched in ucw mfc the result also demonstrated that some other well known eabs such as desulfobulbus which has been shown to respire electrons by oxidizing pyruvate were also enriched on mn ore anode lu et al 2015 additionally eubacterium spp which can anaerobically transform various oxygen containing heterocyclic aromatic compounds was enriched on mn ore anode yan et al 2018 mn oxides have been shown to reduce to mn ii by a dissimilated metal reduction reaction and mn ii can be further oxidized to mn oxides under oxygen conditions xie et al 2018 the overall mn2 concentration in the effluent was constant and the average mn2 concentration in the anode effluent of ucw mfc mn was 2 54 mg l 1 indicating that cod degradation coupled to mn ore reduction may have occurred in addition the mn2 dropped to a minimum average 54 μg l 1 in the cathode effluent due to oxidation effects the mn ii can be formed on oxygen deficient anode and it may be further be oxidized into mno2 at cathode ra of gammaproteobacteria which is involved in manganese cycling was significantly enriched on the mn ore anode on day 140 blöthe et al 2015 fig s4 the ra of gammaproteobacteria was 45 on the mn ore anode the more abundant gammaproteobacteria provided evidence that cod degradation coupled to mn ore reduction may exist in mn ore ucw mfcs moreover these results indicated that a mn cycle existed and the mn cycle contributed to the pollutant removal 3 5 the abundances of the main methanogens in the systems there is limited information related to the systemic methanogen population research in ucw mfcs lu et al 2015 high throughput sequencing results showed that methanogen communities on the anode were observed hydrogenotrophic methanogens orders methanobacteria and methannomicrobia strictly acetotrophic methanogens family methanosaetaceae and mixotrophic methanogens family methanosarcinaceae were found on the anode the ras of methanogens were compared between the mn ore and graphite constructed anodes the identified main methanogens on both electrode substrates were methanosaeta methanosphaera methanosarcina and methanobacterium fig 5b it is well known that methanosaeta and methanosarcina species are capable of producing methane via direct interspecies electron transfer zhao et al 2016 a previous study reported that methanogens can compete with eabs for carbon sources on the anode and thus bioelectricity generation was decreased blöthe et al 2015 notably higher ra of methanosaeta 39 7 was detected on the graphite anode compared to the mn ore anode 24 7 and the detected total ra of methanogens was also high on the graphite anode these results may be because methanogens can compete with eabs for electron donors the mn ore anode can increase the growth of eabs and further inhibit the growth of methanogens picrust results also revealed the ra of methanogen gene families the ra of methane monooxygenase k08684 on the graphite anode increased from 8 28 10 5 to 4 52 10 4 and the ra value increased from 3 34 10 5 to 6 08 10 5 on the mn ore anode with the cod concentration increase fig 5c the ra of methane monooxygenase on the graphite anode was always significantly higher than on the mn ore anode on the contrary the eet funcational genes were enriched on the mn ore anode compared to the graphite anode fig 5d these results suggested that mn ore based ucw mfc mn significantly inhibited methanogens but increased the abundance of exoelectrogen and the functional genes related to eet furthermore picrust predicted metagenomes further demonstrated that the ras of multiple antibiotic resistance genes k05595 on the anode of ucw mfc s were between 0 00041 and 0 00055 notably the ra value for ucw mfc mn was between 0 00037 and 0 00043 which was lower than that for ucw mfc s 3 6 rda analysis between bacterial community wastewater properties and args prevalence in this study rda analysis was used to reveal the relationships between the ra of the args major phyla and the main environmental factors the environmental factors analysis for the effluent comprised the substrate type and antibiotic cod and nh4 n concentrations the bacterial communities included the main phyla bacteroidetes lentisphaerae chloroflexi cyanobacteria patescibacteria and proteobacteria fig 7 a notably the environmental factors sdz cip cod and nh4 n concentrations and substrate type explained 59 5 of the arg variation and the percentage of bacterial phyla explained 35 3 fig 7a the capacity of the substrate to filter out antibiotic and bacteria contributed greatly to the variation of args among the environmental factors substrate type explained 19 9 of changes in args determining that the substrate type had significant impacts on args distribution in effluent among the variables considered the sdz and cip significantly explained most changes 32 8 in the total changes of args fig 7a notably arg levels were always correlated with the abundance of related antibiotics indicating that the removal and accumulation of antibiotics and args can co occur fig 7a the higher ra of the suli and acc 6 ib cr genes were detected in the effluent this may be due to the presence of integrons based on a previous study he et al 2017 the redundancy analysis results also showed that the arg abundance was affected by changes in the bacterial community it was observed that bacteroiodetes and chloroflexi were negatively affected by all target antibiotics and args fig 7a additionally lentisphaerae had positive correlations with suli inti and acc 6 ib cr and proteobacteria and cyanobacteria were correlated with all detected target args according to the rda results fig 7a these results suggested that the evolution of arg host bacteria was a critical factor that determining the changes in args significant positive correlations between sdz mass cip mass and the ra of args on anodes were also revealed fig 7b the selected environmental factors explained 91 of the total arg change rda results also demonstrated that the antibiotic mass accumulation and substrate type had significant impacts on arg distribution and bacterial community distribution characteristics on the anodes 3 7 revealing the correlation between args and their potential hosts by network analysis network analysis further revealed the potential host bacteria at the genus level in the effluent and on the electrodes fig 8 the potential host bacteria for each arg are listed tables s8 and s9 node colours denoted args inti and the potential host bacteria a connection represented a significant positive correlation it can be found that 63 and 36 bacterial taxa at the genus level were significantly correlated with the detected args in effluent and the electrodes samples respectively p 0 05 the network comprised of four args one integron gene inti and the potential args hosts fig 8 significant positive correlations were detected between qnrs and sulii genes in the effluent fig 8a the network relationship on the substrate was relatively simpler than in the effluent significant positive correlations were observed between the ra of sulii acc 6 ib cr and qnrs on electrodes fig 8b moreover inti had significant positive correlations with suli on the electrode the co occurrence of different args was observed due to the strong positive correlations between multiple args the results further demonstrated that these args had the same host bacteria and positive correlations between their bacterial hosts were observed for example there was a significant positive correlation between acc 6 ib cr and qnrs on substrate samples and the co occurrence of these genes was detected in aeromonas desulfovibrio parcubacteria group bacterium adurb bin326 desulfomicrobium and clostridium sensu stricto 8 fig 8b the shift in the potential hosts was a major reason for the args alteration for example the more dominant potential hosts desulfobulbus resulted in a higher abundance of inti on graphite substrates moreover the higher abundances of the dominant potential hosts dysgonomonas and klebsiella for acc 6 ib cr and tolumonas desulfovibrio and wchb1 32 qnrs on electrodes resulted in higher ras of the args on graphite electrodes similarly the co occurrence of the potential hosts was observed in the effluent the dominant potential hosts for sulii and qnrs were allorhizobium neorhizobium pararhizobium rhizobium and wchb1 32 based on network analysis and spearman correlation analysis heatmap fig 8a and fig s5 in addition the potential hosts for inti and qnrs were acetobacteroides and caulobacter and the potential hosts for qnrs and acc 6 ib cr were aeromonas and desulfovibrio 3 8 bioelectricity generation characteristic in two ucw mfcs the average voltage of ucw mfc s and ucw mfc mn reactors for 140 days of operation were 311 mv and 511mv respectively fig s6 with the increase in the cod concentration in the influent the obtained voltage remained stable in ucw mfc mn while the voltage declined in ucw mfc s this may be because the high organic concentration cannot be completely oxidized in the anodic compartment and flowed into the cathode compartment which became anaerobic and deteriorated the cathode performance of the ucw mfc s wang et al 2019c notably mn ore based ucw mfc mn exhibit a higher ability for cod removal and produced high bioelectricity even though the internal resistance of ucw mfc mn was higher than that of ucw mfc s the highest power density increased first and then decreased in ucw mfc mn fig s7 however the cathode potential of ucw mfc s dropped rapidly and the highest power density continuously declined in ucw mfc s therefore these results suggest that the cod concentration in the influent must be controlled within a certain range to obtain the high electricity generation performance the average highest power density of ucw mfc mn was 9 70 mw m 2 which was 3 34 times than that of ucw mfc s 2 90 mw m 2 fig s7 moreover ucw mfc mn achieved a maximum current density of 49 25 ma m 2 which was higher than the maximum current density produced by ucw mfc s 33 09 ma m 2 fig s7 the performance of the cathode played an important role in determining the electricity generation of the system compared with the graphite cathode the mn ore cathode played a prominent role in reactor electricity generation performance the cathode potential in ucw mfc mn was 250 350 mv during the experiment a previous study demonstrated that a mno2 modified cathode can improve electricity generation performance due to cathode catalysis effects yang et al 2016 these findings suggested that the mn ore as the electrode substrate is important for enhancing electricity generation the anode potential of both reactors was not significantly affected during the reactors running and this may be related to the relatively low mass accumulation of antibiotic the deterioration of electricity generation performance of ucw mfc s was mainly due to the deterioration of cathode performance mn ore constructed ucw mfc can enhance cod removal and electricity generation performance and it is also practical when it is used to treat real wastewater not only is its cod treatment efficiency better but the mn ore has the significant price advantage compared with graphite the costs of two materials based on per cubic meter anodic compartment and per milliwatt produced was compared in table s10 it was shown that mn ore has lower price per milliwatt produced however removal rate of sdz and args in mn ore constructed ucw mfc should be intensified therefore it is necessary to explore other ways to enhance the antibiotic and args removal in ucw mfc mn for example the combination electrode with respective advantages should be developed to solve this problem in the furture 4 conclusions our results demonstrated that the abundance of eabs and the functional genes of eet were greatly enriched and the abundances of methanogens and corresponding functional genes as well as multiple antibiotic resistance genes were inhibited in mn ore constructed ucw mfc mn anode the results suggested that the methanogens may be inhibited because eabs can compete with methanogens on the anode due to the existence of dissimilation metal reduction processes higher average output voltage power and current density were obtained in ucw mfc mn during the 140 days of operation in addition cod removal was significantly enhanced in ucw mfc mn during the whole experimental process the continuous accumulation of antibiotics was observed on electrodes while the reactors were running and the stronger antibiotic and args adsorption capacities were observed in graphite constructed ucw mfc s thus low concentrations of antibiotics and low abundances of args were obtained in the effluent of ucw mfc s rda analysis showed that substrate type antibiotic accumulation and bacterial community were the main factors affecting the variations in args in addition the co occurrence of args inti and some potential antibiotic resistant bacteria revealed by network analysis indicated they can spread together to increase the environmental risk notes the authors declare that they do not have any competing

18511,microplastics have been found to be ubiquitous in freshwater ecosystems providing a novel substrate for biofilm formation here we incubated biofilm on microplastics and two natural substrates rock and leaf under a controlled environment to investigate the differences of microbial community structure antibiotic resistance gene arg profiles and arg microbial hosts between biofilms on three types of substrates results from high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene revealed that microplastic biofilm had a distinctive community structure network analyses suggested that microplastic biofilm possessed the highest node connected community but with lower average path length network diameter and modularity compared with biofilm on two natural particles metagenomic analyses further revealed microplastic biofilm with broad spectrum and distinctive resistome specifically according to taxonomic annotation of arg microbial hosts two opportunisitic human pathogens pseudomonas monteilii pseudomonas mendocina and one plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae were detected only in the microplastic biofilm but not in biofilms formed on natural substrates our findings suggest that microplastic is a novel microbial niche and may serve as a vector for args and pathogens to new environment in river water generating freshwater environmental risk and exerting adverse impacts on human health graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic biofilm metagenomics antibiotic resistance gene pathogen 1 introduction as an environmental contaminant on the global scale microplastics are the subject of increasing scientific concern due to their elevated ecological risks and potentially adverse effects on public health defined as plastic particles with a size of less than 5 mm microplastics can be generated in one of two ways primary microplastics initially manufactured in small size for industrial purposes such as microbeads adding to personal care products as abrasives and secondary microplastics derived from the fragmentation of large plastic pieces by physical chemical and biological factors including mechanical abrasion photooxidation and biological degradation rachman 2018 oceans have long been the focus of studies into microplastics because they are considered to be the largest sink of microplastics recently however the focus of research has expanded to include freshwater ecosystems given that approximately 80 of microplastic contamination in marine environments originates from land and river rachman 2018 current evidence indicates that microplastics are ubiquitous in rivers on the global scale eerkes medrano et al 2015 klein et al 2015 mccormick et al 2014 su et al 2016 and have been discovered in freshwater biota at different trophic levels rachman 2018 on the long voyage from source to sink microplastics will be colonized by microorganisms and wrapped by biofilms after dynamic succession schluter et al 2015 colonized by diverse and metabolically complex microbial consortia the microplastic surface is proposed to be a hotspot for horizontal gene transfer hgt schluter et al 2015 sorensen et al 2005 it has been demonstrated that biofilms serve as reservoirs for pathogenic bacteria wingender and flemming 2011 and microenvironments for horizontal gene transfer hausner and wuertz 1999 horizontal gene transfer mediates the flow of antibiotic resistance genes args between the microorganisms in biofilm and environmental bacteria bengtsson palme and larsson 2015 li et al 2015 martinez et al 2015 van boeckel et al 2015 via mobile genetic elements mges such as plasmids transposons bacteriophages insertion sequences and integrons stokes and gillings 2011 given that some opportunistic pathogens such as vibrio spp have been discovered in microplastic biofilm foulon et al 2016 keswani et al 2016 kirstein et al 2016 it is possible that specific pathogens in microplastic biofilm will acquire args from environmental bacteria and travel with microplastics to reach remote environments the resistance to antibiotics of pathogens harbouring args make them hard to be killed by therapeutics which poses a potential worldwide threat to ecosystem and human health previous studies have indicated that the biofilm communities on plastic substrates were distinctive from those in water columns or sediment amaral zettler et al 2015 de tender et al 2015 mccormick et al 2014 oberbeckmann et al 2014 zettler et al 2013 however the link between the structure and function of the biofilm communities on microplastic is still not fully understood here we investigated the differences between biofilms on microplastics and two natural substrates rock and leaf by comparing the microbial community structure arg profiles and arg bacterial hosts of the biofilm associated with microplastics and two natural substrates this approach allowed us to better understand the features of the microbial community on microplastics and to provide insight into the possibility of various surfaces both anthropogenic and naturally occurring to spread antibiotic resistance genes via biofilms in the freshwater ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and water quality parameters in order to test the effects of substrate type anthropogenic or natural on the associated biofilms we used river water to culture the

sample using the illumina hiseq 2500 platform 2 250 paired ends sequence analysis was carried out using the qiime pipeline version 1 8 0 caporaso et al 2010 in brief the two pair end sequencing data were merged into one according to the overlapping relationship using flash version1 2 7 magoc and salzberg 2011 after filtering low quality and short sequences by trimmomatic version 0 33 bolger et al 2014 and chimera sequences by uchime kozich et al 2013 we subsampled the reads to obtain the same number of reads in each sample which was 73 289 clean reads the sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at 97 identity with uclust caporaso et al 2010 edgar 2010 taxonomy assignments were conducted by applying silva database as the reference caporaso et al 2010 2 6 shotgun metagenomics and data processing paired end 2 150 metagenomic sequencing was performed on an illumina hiseq 2000 platform the raw reads were dereplicated and trimmed by the quality the clean reads were assembled into scaffolds by using idba ud version 1 1 1 peng et al 2012 the open reading frames orfs in scaffolds were predicted by prodigal version 2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 and annotated using blastp by applying the args database e value 10 5 sequence identity 80 query coverage 70 alignment length 25 amino acids the abundance of args was calculated by mapping reads to the gene sequences ma et al 2016 and normalized by the abundance of 16s rrna genes relative abundance expressed as copies of args per copy of 16s rrna gene li et al 2015 consistent with the qpcr results reported in many previous studies chen et al 2017 feng et al 2018 marti et al 2018 the relative abundance of the args type or subtype were calculated using the following equation li et al 2015

no srp174395 for 16s analysis and accession no srp174465 for metagenomic analysis 2 7 data analysis statistical analyses were performed using r version 3 4 1 r found stat comput vienna and the results were visualized by origin the p value of 0 05 was regarded as statistically significant wilcoxon rank sum test to understand the inter associations among microorganisms in the whole community we used network analysis barberan et al 2012 after calculating the pairwise spearman s correlation coefficients ρ a matrix was constructed to explore the potential relationships in the microbial community the correlation between two nodes were considered as statistically significant for ρ 0 8 and p value 0 01 and the correlation network was formed the analysis result was performed using r version 3 4 1 and visualized by the gephi version 0 9 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 biomass of microplastic biofilm was more than rock biofilm but less than leaf biofilm measured by flow cytometry every two days the biomass of microplastic biofilm constantly increased and reached a peak of 3 1 108 cells g 1 on day 8 fig 1 a table s1 the planktonic cells in the surrounding water maintained a relatively steady concentration of 2 7 107 cells ml 1 the highest biomass of microplastic was 2 4 times that of the rock biofilm and 0 14 times that of leaf biofilm based on the sem micrographs the occurrence of the biofilm after a short period of time compared with the pristine surface of the materials was further demonstrated fig 1b fig s1 the outline of bacterial cells in microplastic and leaf biofilm were both evident the cell surface of microplastic biofilm was smooth while the cells of leaf biofilm were rough and small amount of filiform extracellular polymeric substance eps could be observed the observed biomass was in the order leaf biofilm microplastic biofilm rock biofilm the leaf biofilm possessed the highest biomass of the three biofilms which could be the result of the fast breakdown process of the dissolved organic matter dom in the leaf thus increasing the availability of nutrients and promoting bacterial growth gulis and suberkropp 2003 during leaf decomposition the release of a large amount of organic substances attracts colonizers to utilize the nutrients and supports the growth of the thick biofilm the nature of the microbial community in the leaf biofilm plays an important role in the leaf utilization mcarthur et al 1985 the varied responses of the bacterial species to components during leaf decomposition have been observed mcnamara and leff 2004 for example the population of burkholderia cepacia increased when dom concentrations were greatest while the population of pseudomonas putida was inhibited when total dom concentrations were greatest which indicates the complexity of microbial population dynamics microplastics and rock do not decompose and therefore after entering the aquatic environment their surfaces will absorb nutrients from water and form the conditioning film siboni et al 2007 colonizers will be attracted by the conditioning film and this initial community will be continuously shaped in contrast with the rock surface that possesses fewer nutrients and lower biofilm biomass microplastics could be used as an energy and carbon source by microorganisms producing enzymes capable of hydrolysing plastic yoshida et al 2016 in addition the variation of biofilms on the three materials could also be attributed to the discrepant consortia and microbial community structure 3 2 microplastic biofilm had distinctive microbial communities structure compared with rock and leaf biofilm the biofilms formed on the three materials could be divided into two categories biofilm on anthropogenic substrates microplastic and natural substrates rock and leaf the biofilm community structure was evaluated and compared from phylogenetic composition α diversity within sample diversity β diversity between sample diversity and differential abundance analysis of enriched depleted otus microplastic and rock biofilm shared the most dominant phyla with proteobacteria the most abundant 60 77 followed by bacteroidetes 8 15 and firmicutes 6 14 in leaf biofilm bacteroidetes 46 was the most abundant fig 2 a the relative proportions of chlorobi acidobacteria gemmatimonadetes actinobacteria fibrobacteres planctomycetes hydrogenedentes and chlamydiae were higher in biofilms formed on microplastics than in biofilms formed on natural substrates table s2 previous research has shown a lower abundance of bacteroidetes in biofilms formed on plastic surfaces compared with native cellulose and inert glass beads particles ogonowski et al 2018 in this study the abundance of bacteroidetes in biofilms formed on microplastics was lower than in biofilms formed on both of the natural substrates which is consistent with previous observations to evaluate the α diversity of the biofilm community the shannon wiener index was calculated the α diversity revealed a gradient of microplastic biofilm rock biofilm leaf biofilm the shannon index of the microplastic biofilm was significantly higher than those on natural substrates fig 2b wilcoxon rank sum test p value 0 05 indicating that microplastic biofilm was more diverse than the rock and leaf biofilm the high α diversity may suggest the resilience to perturbation girvan et al 2005 and the capacity of maintaining the activities of the biofilm members philippot et al 2013 additionally principal coordinate analysis pcoa was conducted to identify the separation pattern between biofilm communities based on a phylogenetically weighted unifrac distance matrix all microplastic biofilm samples were clearly clustered into one group and separated from the rock and leaf biofilm samples along the first principal coordinate illustrating that the largest source of variation in biofilm communities is substrate type fig 2c the pattern of separation was consistent with the gradient of α diversity from microplastic biofilm to rock biofilm to leaf biofilm microorganisms in river water preferentially colonize the substrate and the gradually matured biofilm selectively enriches specific microorganisms from river water this two way selection mutually carves the delicate architecture of biofilm by identifying the otus with differential abundances in biofilm compared to in river water i e significantly enriched depleted otus in biofilm the selection on the three substrates could be determined a total of 515 otus were identified in all three types of biofilm and in river water of these 296 284 and 178 otus were significantly enriched from river water by microplastic rock and leaf biofilm respectively fig 3 a p value 0 05 the majority of otus 282 out of 296 enriched in the microplastic biofilm also colonized rock and leaf surfaces fig 3b microplastic biofilm was found to be more similar to rock biofilm than to leaf biofilm given that microplastic biofilm shared 274 enriched otus with rock biofilm but only shared 159 enriched otus with leaf biofilm specifically 14 otus were found to be uniquely enriched in microplastic biofilm and these were distributed across 3 phyla proteobacteria gemmatimonadetes and actinobacteria fig 3c table s3 the otus uniquely enriched in the rock or leaf biofilm were distributed across 6 phyla bacteroidetes firmicutes saccharibacteria proteobacteria parcubacteria and cyanobacteria enriched or depleted otus in the microplastic biofilm revealed that colonization onto the substrates is not a passive process and that this novel niche selects the colonizers previous studies have reported differences in microbial communities between microplastic biofilms and water columns including river and ocean kettner et al 2017 mccormick et al 2014 zettler et al 2013 evidence for the differences between biofilm on plastic and natural substrates miao et al 2019 ogonowski et al 2018 has also been documented which is consistent with our results miao et al 2019 incubated biofilm on microplastic substrates polyethylene polypropylene and natural substrates cobblestone and wood in lake water under controlled conditions the sorting phenomenon of microbial communities between microplastic and natural substrates was observed ogonowski et al 2018 exposed ambient baltic seawater to plastic polyethylene polypropylene polystyrene and cellulose particles the plastic associated communities were evidently different from those formed on the non plastic substrates in accordance with previous investigations our study has contributed another example of the term plastisphere applied to freshwater ecosystems mccormick et al 2014 3 3 network structure of microplastic biofilm community was more complex and connected the biofilm community is a tightly combined network the above analyses had proved the discrepancy of taxa composition and abundance between microplastic biofilm and natural substrates the underlying interaction among taxa in complex communities should also be evaluated to better recognize the co abundance pattern of microbial consortia in order to investigate the topology of the network and the potential interactions between microbial taxa network analysis of significant taxon co occurrence patterns was used to decipher the structure of biofilm communities by calculating the pairwise spearman s correlation coefficients ρ the topology of the resulting network was calculated and otus with a correlation of 0 8 or greater to other otus were shown fig 4 nodes represent otus and edges represent the correlation between otus red for positive correlation grey for negative correlation the size of the node is proportional to the number of edges linking to it the modularity index is used to determine whether the network has a modular structure a modularity index 0 4 suggests that the network has a modular structure barberan et al 2012 newman 2006 the modularity index of 0 847 rock biofilm 0 708 microplastic biofilm and 0 719 leaf biofilm indicated that the formed networks had a modular structure newman 2006 evidently the correlation pattern of microplastic biofilm was more complex than that of rock and leaf biofilms a total of 120 110 and 35 otus were identified to have a significant correlation with each other in microplastic rock and leaf biofilm respectively table s4 the microplastic biofilm had the highest number of correlated otus which belonged to 12 phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes acidobacteria epsilonbacteraeota verrucomicrobia gemmatimonadetes patescibacteria tenericutes planctomycetes chlamydiae and nitrospirae shown by the co occurring patterns between otus with significant correlations the co occurrence network depicts potential interacting or niche overlapping relationships in which the microorganisms in biofilm could be involved zhou et al 2010 the complexity of connections of the different biofilms was explored and the topological properties of the resulting networks was calculated as can be seen from fig 4 the microplastic biofilm network visually possessed the highest level of complexity whereas the rock and leaf biofilms presented a less complex network in terms of the topology properties the microplastic biofilm network presented the highest number of connections per node average degree 13 835 indicating a highly connected community table s5 however the average path length 2 062 and network diameter 6 for the microplastic biofilm were both lower than for the other two types of biofilms the average path length is defined as the average number of steps along the shortest paths between each node being a measure of efficiency on a network zhou et al 2010 while the network diameter is defined as the longest distance between nodes in the network meanwhile the microplastic biofilm network presented a less modular structure modularity 0 708 than rock 0 847 and leaf biofilm 0 719 which is characterized by the presence of different groups of nodes containing high numbers of interconnections with some degree of independency between groups newman 2006 in short the topology properties suggested that the microplastic biofilm was the community with the highest connection of nodes but with lower average path length network diameter and modularity the relatively higher modularity of the leaf biofilm combined with the shortest average path length may imply a more prompt response of the microbial community to environmental perturbations faust and raes 2012 by allowing the perturbations to reach the whole network immediately so that the network structure as well as the functions could be altered zhou et al 2010 it would appear that the microbial community attached to the leaf was not just loosely gathering around it but could thrive and respond to environmental disturbances as a whole 3 4 broad spectrum and distinctive resistome profile of args were detected in the microplastic biofilm it is essential to evaluate the args profiles in the three types of biofilm and in river water given that information regarding of args profiles in microplastic biofilm is limited compared with other environments which have been thoroughly investigated and recorded allen et al 2010 the arg profiles in all biofilm and river water samples were determined 267 arg subtypes belonging to 26 arg types were identified in all samples the diversity of arg number of arg subtype decreased in the order of leaf biofilm 207 microplastic biofilm 188 rock biofilm 185 and river water 67 table s6 table s7 the arg abundance of biofilm was approximately 3 fold higher than that of river water fig 5 a indicating that args were enriched by biofilm the dominant arg types included multidrug args 22 03 mls 18 06 bacitracin 9 59 polymyxin 9 44 acriflavine 6 31 beta lactam 6 08 and aminoglycoside 5 81 fig 5b statistically 40 6 of the total 267 args were shared by all samples such as mls macb multidrug mdtb and acriflavine acrb fig 5c our sampling site haihe river is located in a high economically developed region and is a direct recipient of urban agricultural and industrial waste zhao et al 2010 the high antibiotic emissions in the haihe river region were verified in previous studies luo et al 2010 2011 the emission of antibiotics into the water ecosystem would contribute to the antibiotic resistance selection andersson and hughes 2011 which could explain the high diversity of args in biofilms cultured with water sampled from the haihe river many arg subtypes found in the microplastic biofilm were also previously detected using pcr methods such as ampc in wastewater volkmann et al 2004 teto tetq in lagoons smith et al 2004 sul1 sul2 blatem in

biofilm belonged to the multidrug resistance type which was also found to be dominant in other specific environments forsberg et al 2012 li et al 2015 zhu et al 2013 consistent with the results of previous studies reporting the presence of pseudomonas in hospital wastewater treatment plants and in drinking water carrying multidrug resistant genes ma et al 2016 we also found a high proportion of mdr genes in the microplastic biofilm the microplastic biofilm possessed arg subtypes not detected in the rock or leaf biofilms indicating that these args could not be loaded by natural particles specific types of args may be selectively enriched by the microplastic biofilm the extracellular substances in biofilms could be shared and the function of the cooperative interaction of biofilms would transport args between the cells via the biofilm matrix ostrowski et al 2011 direct leaf litter is one of the major sources of organic matter in the freshwater system and is rapidly colonized by microorganisms when entering the river environment most of the leaf leachate is composed of simple carbohydrates and may provide nutrients and carbon to the bacteria on the surface much of the microbial biomass in the river is located in biofilms lock et al 1984 as the first to encounter leachate from leaf mcarthur and colleagues showed that leaf biofilm influences the utilization of leaf leachate mcarthur et al 1985 the highest diversity of arg number of arg subtype in the leaf biofilm reminded us that leaves may be a natural source of args in the river environment in addition to microplastics we should also focus on the potential to transfer args inside the freshwater system a previous study based on a metagenomics analysis showed the exchange of args between clinical pathogens and environmental bacteria forsberg et al 2012 after verifying that the microplastic biofilm loads args it is essential to trace back the origin of the args and to identify which args were carried by which bacteria 3 5 microplastic biofilm selectively enriched opportunisitic human pathogens which carried args biofilms equip the microbial community with novel functions including increased resistance to antibiotics stewart and costerton 2001 after verifying that the bacteria in the microplastic biofilm indeed possessed genes with resistance to antibiotics questions remain about which bacteria possess these args and whether they pose a threat to human health to answer that question taxonomic annotation of arg bacterial hosts was conducted at the genus level we found that with the exception of the unclassified pluralibacter 18 97 pseudomonas 17 78 leclercia 11 71 and pantoea 11 06 are relatively abundant in all of the samples fig 7 a table s8 the proportions of the four genera in biofilm on three types of substrates are shown in fig 7b in both microplastic and rock biofilms the dominant host was pseudomonas with a proportion of 34 7 and 26 7 respectively while the largest proportion 20 9 in leaf biofilm was pantoea most of the hosts possessed multidrug resistance genes and aminoglycoside resistance genes fig 7c the multidrug resistance genes were carried by 50 9 50 2 46 8 of the host pseudomonas in the microplastic biofilm rock biofilm and leaf biofilm respectively table s9 the presence of pseudomonas in the microplastic biofilm was further verified by quantitative real time pcr of samples from three independent bioreactors see supplementary material for detailed data table s10 table s11 next host tracking analysis of the four major hosts pluralibacter pseudomonas leclercia and pantoea was conducted at the species level a number of the scaffolds carrying args were annotated to plant pathogens and human pathogens it should be noted that several pathogenic bacteria were only detected in microplastic biofilm but not in the rock or leaf biofilms fig 8 these pathogenic bacteria included pseudomonas monteilii an opportunistic pathogen more frequently detected in clinical environments and the major microbial species behind the disease of hypersensitivity pneumonitis and exacerbating bronchiectasis aditi et al 2017 bogaerts et al 2011 ocampo sosa et al 2015 pseudomonas mendocina an environmental bacterium causing opportunistic nosocomial infections such as infective endocarditis and spondylodiscitis chi et al 2005 mert et al 2007 and pseudomonas syringae an agriculturally important plant pathogen hirano and upper 2000 the microplastic biofilm selectively enriched these pathogens but no enrichment was observed in either rock or leaf biofilms as one of the most common plant pathogens p syringae has more than 60 pathovars and infects almost all economically important crop species xin et al 2018 in a previous study the outbreak of harmful alexandrium taylori algae bloom was shown to result from the attachment of a taylori cells to plastic debris maso et al 2003 the plant pathogens carried by microplastics may lead to pecuniary loss the existence of pathogens with args will increase the risk of antibiotic ineffectiveness because of the difficulty in treating the infection organic aggregates in water are islands for microbial assemblages and sometimes for pathogens lyons et al 2010 similarly microplastics could be considered as a much more durable island with high residence time under natural conditions microplastics in the river water environment may become the preferred surface for specific pathogens with other alternative natural particles existing in the same environment at the same time microplastics not only serve as a novel microhabitat for biofilm colonization but they also increase the likelihood of pathogens propagating the pathogens may have contact with humans along the river via direct exposure to the water area a number of questions remain to be addressed by future research including whether the architecture of the biofilm will remain complete after longer migration distances and greater geographic spread whether the microbial community structure will be continuously shaped because of environmental factors deviation in varied water environments and whether the pathogens in the biofilm remain hazardous and have an impact on local microbial communities 4 conclusions microplastics provide a unique microhabitat that supports the growth of specific bacterial consortia microplastic biofilms have a distinctive microbial community structure compared with biofilms formed on natural substrates as verified by taxon composition community separation pattern pcoa analysis otus with significantly different abundance and network relationships specific arg subtypes and several pathogenic bacterial hosts were also selectively enriched by microplastic biofilm microplastics could be viewed as a novel functionally important microhabitat in rivers and the dispersal of the microorganisms present within microplastic biofilms especially pathogenic microorganisms may enhance the risks to human health further studies are therefore required to establish the mechanism of horizontal gene transfer of args via microplastic biofilms this could pave the way for a more thorough understanding of the environmental behaviour and function of these anthropogenic particles in the freshwater ecosystem differences among the microplastic and biofilm and the natural particles have the potential to affect river environments in at least two ways first by introducing species into places where rock and leaf particles cannot reach and change the local community structure and second by transporting species including specific pathogens with tolerance to antibiotics downstream declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18511,microplastics have been found to be ubiquitous in freshwater ecosystems providing a novel substrate for biofilm formation here we incubated biofilm on microplastics and two natural substrates rock and leaf under a controlled environment to investigate the differences of microbial community structure antibiotic resistance gene arg profiles and arg microbial hosts between biofilms on three types of substrates results from high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene revealed that microplastic biofilm had a distinctive community structure network analyses suggested that microplastic biofilm possessed the highest node connected community but with lower average path length network diameter and modularity compared with biofilm on two natural particles metagenomic analyses further revealed microplastic biofilm with broad spectrum and distinctive resistome specifically according to taxonomic annotation of arg microbial hosts two opportunisitic human pathogens pseudomonas monteilii pseudomonas mendocina and one plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae were detected only in the microplastic biofilm but not in biofilms formed on natural substrates our findings suggest that microplastic is a novel microbial niche and may serve as a vector for args and pathogens to new environment in river water generating freshwater environmental risk and exerting adverse impacts on human health graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic biofilm metagenomics antibiotic resistance gene pathogen 1 introduction as an environmental contaminant on the global scale microplastics are the subject of increasing scientific concern due to their elevated ecological risks and potentially adverse effects on public health defined as plastic particles with a size of less than 5 mm microplastics can be generated in one of two ways primary microplastics initially manufactured in small size for industrial purposes such as microbeads adding to personal care products as abrasives and secondary microplastics derived from the fragmentation of large plastic pieces by physical chemical and biological factors including mechanical abrasion photooxidation and biological degradation rachman 2018 oceans have long been the focus of studies into microplastics because they are considered to be the largest sink of microplastics recently however the focus of research has expanded to include freshwater ecosystems given that approximately 80 of microplastic contamination in marine environments originates from land and river rachman 2018 current evidence indicates that microplastics are ubiquitous in rivers on the global scale eerkes medrano et al 2015 klein et al 2015 mccormick et al 2014 su et al 2016 and have been discovered in freshwater biota at different trophic levels rachman 2018 on the long voyage from source to sink microplastics will be colonized by microorganisms and wrapped by biofilms after dynamic succession schluter et al 2015 colonized by diverse and metabolically complex microbial consortia the microplastic surface is proposed to be a hotspot for horizontal gene transfer hgt schluter et al 2015 sorensen et al 2005 it has been demonstrated that biofilms serve as reservoirs for pathogenic bacteria wingender and flemming 2011 and microenvironments for horizontal gene transfer hausner and wuertz 1999 horizontal gene transfer mediates the flow of antibiotic resistance genes args between the microorganisms in biofilm and environmental bacteria bengtsson palme and larsson 2015 li et al 2015 martinez et al 2015 van boeckel et al 2015 via mobile genetic elements mges such as plasmids transposons bacteriophages insertion sequences and integrons stokes and gillings 2011 given that some opportunistic pathogens such as vibrio spp have been discovered in microplastic biofilm foulon et al 2016 keswani et al 2016 kirstein et al 2016 it is possible that specific pathogens in microplastic biofilm will acquire args from environmental bacteria and travel with microplastics to reach remote environments the resistance to antibiotics of pathogens harbouring args make them hard to be killed by therapeutics which poses a potential worldwide threat to ecosystem and human health previous studies have indicated that the biofilm communities on plastic substrates were distinctive from those in water columns or sediment amaral zettler et al 2015 de tender et al 2015 mccormick et al 2014 oberbeckmann et al 2014 zettler et al 2013 however the link between the structure and function of the biofilm communities on microplastic is still not fully understood here we investigated the differences between biofilms on microplastics and two natural substrates rock and leaf by comparing the microbial community structure arg profiles and arg bacterial hosts of the biofilm associated with microplastics and two natural substrates this approach allowed us to better understand the features of the microbial community on microplastics and to provide insight into the possibility of various surfaces both anthropogenic and naturally occurring to spread antibiotic resistance genes via biofilms in the freshwater ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and water quality parameters in order to test the effects of substrate type anthropogenic or natural on the associated biofilms we used river water to culture the

sample using the illumina hiseq 2500 platform 2 250 paired ends sequence analysis was carried out using the qiime pipeline version 1 8 0 caporaso et al 2010 in brief the two pair end sequencing data were merged into one according to the overlapping relationship using flash version1 2 7 magoc and salzberg 2011 after filtering low quality and short sequences by trimmomatic version 0 33 bolger et al 2014 and chimera sequences by uchime kozich et al 2013 we subsampled the reads to obtain the same number of reads in each sample which was 73 289 clean reads the sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at 97 identity with uclust caporaso et al 2010 edgar 2010 taxonomy assignments were conducted by applying silva database as the reference caporaso et al 2010 2 6 shotgun metagenomics and data processing paired end 2 150 metagenomic sequencing was performed on an illumina hiseq 2000 platform the raw reads were dereplicated and trimmed by the quality the clean reads were assembled into scaffolds by using idba ud version 1 1 1 peng et al 2012 the open reading frames orfs in scaffolds were predicted by prodigal version 2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 and annotated using blastp by applying the args database e value 10 5 sequence identity 80 query coverage 70 alignment length 25 amino acids the abundance of args was calculated by mapping reads to the gene sequences ma et al 2016 and normalized by the abundance of 16s rrna genes relative abundance expressed as copies of args per copy of 16s rrna gene li et al 2015 consistent with the qpcr results reported in many previous studies chen et al 2017 feng et al 2018 marti et al 2018 the relative abundance of the args type or subtype were calculated using the following equation li et al 2015

were visualized by origin the p value of 0 05 was regarded as statistically significant wilcoxon rank sum test to understand the inter associations among microorganisms in the whole community we used network analysis barberan et al 2012 after calculating the pairwise spearman s correlation coefficients ρ a matrix was constructed to explore the potential relationships in the microbial community the correlation between two nodes were considered as statistically significant for ρ 0 8 and p value 0 01 and the correlation network was formed the analysis result was performed using r version 3 4 1 and visualized by the gephi version 0 9 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 biomass of microplastic biofilm was more than rock biofilm but less than leaf biofilm measured by flow cytometry every two days the biomass of microplastic biofilm constantly increased and reached a peak of 3 1 108 cells g 1 on day 8 fig 1 a table s1 the planktonic cells in the surrounding water maintained a relatively steady concentration of 2 7 107 cells ml 1 the highest biomass of microplastic was 2 4 times that of the rock biofilm and 0 14 times that of leaf biofilm based on the sem micrographs the occurrence of the biofilm after a short period of time compared with the pristine surface of the materials was further demonstrated fig 1b fig s1 the outline of bacterial cells in microplastic and leaf biofilm were both evident the cell surface of microplastic biofilm was smooth while the cells of leaf biofilm were rough and small amount of filiform extracellular polymeric substance eps could be observed the observed biomass was in the order leaf biofilm microplastic biofilm rock biofilm the leaf biofilm possessed the highest biomass of the three biofilms which could be the result of the fast breakdown process of the dissolved organic matter dom in the leaf thus increasing the availability of nutrients and promoting bacterial growth gulis and suberkropp 2003 during leaf decomposition the release of a large amount of organic substances attracts colonizers to utilize the nutrients and supports the growth of the thick biofilm the nature of the microbial community in the leaf biofilm plays an important role in the leaf utilization mcarthur et al 1985 the varied responses of the bacterial species to components during leaf decomposition have been observed mcnamara and leff 2004 for example the population of burkholderia cepacia increased when dom concentrations were greatest while the population of pseudomonas putida was inhibited when total dom concentrations were greatest which indicates the complexity of microbial population dynamics microplastics and rock do not decompose and therefore after entering the aquatic environment their surfaces will absorb nutrients from water and form the conditioning film siboni et al 2007 colonizers will be attracted by the conditioning film and this initial community will be continuously shaped in contrast with the rock surface that possesses fewer nutrients and lower biofilm biomass microplastics could be used as an energy and carbon source by microorganisms producing enzymes capable of hydrolysing plastic yoshida et al 2016 in addition the variation of biofilms on the three materials could also be attributed to the discrepant consortia and microbial community structure 3 2 microplastic biofilm had distinctive microbial communities structure compared with rock and leaf biofilm the biofilms formed on the three materials could be divided into two categories biofilm on anthropogenic substrates microplastic and natural substrates rock and leaf the biofilm community structure was evaluated and compared from phylogenetic composition α diversity within sample diversity β diversity between sample diversity and differential abundance analysis of enriched depleted otus microplastic and rock biofilm shared the most dominant phyla with proteobacteria the most abundant 60 77 followed by bacteroidetes 8 15 and firmicutes 6 14 in leaf biofilm bacteroidetes 46 was the most abundant fig 2 a the relative proportions of chlorobi acidobacteria gemmatimonadetes actinobacteria fibrobacteres planctomycetes hydrogenedentes and chlamydiae were higher in biofilms formed on microplastics than in biofilms formed on natural substrates table s2 previous research has shown a lower abundance of bacteroidetes in biofilms formed on plastic surfaces compared with native cellulose and inert glass beads particles ogonowski et al 2018 in this study the abundance of bacteroidetes in biofilms formed on microplastics was lower than in biofilms formed on both of the natural substrates which is consistent with previous observations to evaluate the α diversity of the biofilm community the shannon wiener index was calculated the α diversity revealed a gradient of microplastic biofilm rock biofilm leaf biofilm the shannon index of the microplastic biofilm was significantly higher than those on natural substrates fig 2b wilcoxon rank sum test p value 0 05 indicating that microplastic biofilm was more diverse than the rock and leaf biofilm the high α diversity may suggest the resilience to perturbation girvan et al 2005 and the capacity of maintaining the activities of the biofilm members philippot et al 2013 additionally principal coordinate analysis pcoa was conducted to identify the separation pattern between biofilm communities based on a phylogenetically weighted unifrac distance matrix all microplastic biofilm samples were clearly clustered into one group and separated from the rock and leaf biofilm samples along the first principal coordinate illustrating that the largest source of variation in biofilm communities is substrate type fig 2c the pattern of separation was consistent with the gradient of α diversity from microplastic biofilm to rock biofilm to leaf biofilm microorganisms in river water preferentially colonize the substrate and the gradually matured biofilm selectively enriches specific microorganisms from river water this two way selection mutually carves the delicate architecture of biofilm by identifying the otus with differential abundances in biofilm compared to in river water i e significantly enriched depleted otus in biofilm the selection on the three substrates could be determined a total of 515 otus were identified in all three types of biofilm and in river water of these 296 284 and 178 otus were significantly enriched from river water by microplastic rock and leaf biofilm respectively fig 3 a p value 0 05 the majority of otus 282 out of 296 enriched in the microplastic biofilm also colonized rock and leaf surfaces fig 3b microplastic biofilm was found to be more similar to rock biofilm than to leaf biofilm given that microplastic biofilm shared 274 enriched otus with rock biofilm but only shared 159 enriched otus with leaf biofilm specifically 14 otus were found to be uniquely enriched in microplastic biofilm and these were distributed across 3 phyla proteobacteria gemmatimonadetes and actinobacteria fig 3c table s3 the otus uniquely enriched in the rock or leaf biofilm were distributed across 6 phyla bacteroidetes firmicutes saccharibacteria proteobacteria parcubacteria and cyanobacteria enriched or depleted otus in the microplastic biofilm revealed that colonization onto the substrates is not a passive process and that this novel niche selects the colonizers previous studies have reported differences in microbial communities between microplastic biofilms and water columns including river and ocean kettner et al 2017 mccormick et al 2014 zettler et al 2013 evidence for the differences between biofilm on plastic and natural substrates miao et al 2019 ogonowski et al 2018 has also been documented which is consistent with our results miao et al 2019 incubated biofilm on microplastic substrates polyethylene polypropylene and natural substrates cobblestone and wood in lake water under controlled conditions the sorting phenomenon of microbial communities between microplastic and natural substrates was observed ogonowski et al 2018 exposed ambient baltic seawater to plastic polyethylene polypropylene polystyrene and cellulose particles the plastic associated communities were evidently different from those formed on the non plastic substrates in accordance with previous investigations our study has contributed another example of the term plastisphere applied to freshwater ecosystems mccormick et al 2014 3 3 network structure of microplastic biofilm community was more complex and connected the biofilm community is a tightly combined network the above analyses had proved the discrepancy of taxa composition and abundance between microplastic biofilm and natural substrates the underlying interaction among taxa in complex communities should also be evaluated to better recognize the co abundance pattern of microbial consortia in order to investigate the topology of the network and the potential interactions between microbial taxa network analysis of significant taxon co occurrence patterns was used to decipher the structure of biofilm communities by calculating the pairwise spearman s correlation coefficients ρ the topology of the resulting network was calculated and otus with a correlation of 0 8 or greater to other otus were shown fig 4 nodes represent otus and edges represent the correlation between otus red for positive correlation grey for negative correlation the size of the node is proportional to the number of edges linking to it the modularity index is used to determine whether the network has a modular structure a modularity index 0 4 suggests that the network has a modular structure barberan et al 2012 newman 2006 the modularity index of 0 847 rock biofilm 0 708 microplastic biofilm and 0 719 leaf biofilm indicated that the formed networks had a modular structure newman 2006 evidently the correlation pattern of microplastic biofilm was more complex than that of rock and leaf biofilms a total of 120 110 and 35 otus were identified to have a significant correlation with each other in microplastic rock and leaf biofilm respectively table s4 the microplastic biofilm had the highest number of correlated otus which belonged to 12 phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes acidobacteria epsilonbacteraeota verrucomicrobia gemmatimonadetes patescibacteria tenericutes planctomycetes chlamydiae and nitrospirae shown by the co occurring patterns between otus with significant correlations the co occurrence network depicts potential interacting or niche overlapping relationships in which the microorganisms in biofilm could be involved zhou et al 2010 the complexity of connections of the different biofilms was explored and the topological properties of the resulting networks was calculated as can be seen from fig 4 the microplastic biofilm network visually possessed the highest level of complexity whereas the rock and leaf biofilms presented a less complex network in terms of the topology properties the microplastic biofilm network presented the highest number of connections per node average degree 13 835 indicating a highly connected community table s5 however the average path length 2 062 and network diameter 6 for the microplastic biofilm were both lower than for the other two types of biofilms the average path length is defined as the average number of steps along the shortest paths between each node being a measure of efficiency on a network zhou et al 2010 while the network diameter is defined as the longest distance between nodes in the network meanwhile the microplastic biofilm network presented a less modular structure modularity 0 708 than rock 0 847 and leaf biofilm 0 719 which is characterized by the presence of different groups of nodes containing high numbers of interconnections with some degree of independency between groups newman 2006 in short the topology properties suggested that the microplastic biofilm was the community with the highest connection of nodes but with lower average path length network diameter and modularity the relatively higher modularity of the leaf biofilm combined with the shortest average path length may imply a more prompt response of the microbial community to environmental perturbations faust and raes 2012 by allowing the perturbations to reach the whole network immediately so that the network structure as well as the functions could be altered zhou et al 2010 it would appear that the microbial community attached to the leaf was not just loosely gathering around it but could thrive and respond to environmental disturbances as a whole 3 4 broad spectrum and distinctive resistome profile of args were detected in the microplastic biofilm it is essential to evaluate the args profiles in the three types of biofilm and in river water given that information regarding of args profiles in microplastic biofilm is limited compared with other environments which have been thoroughly investigated and recorded allen et al 2010 the arg profiles in all biofilm and river water samples were determined 267 arg subtypes belonging to 26 arg types were identified in all samples the diversity of arg number of arg subtype decreased in the order of leaf biofilm 207 microplastic biofilm 188 rock biofilm 185 and river water 67 table s6 table s7 the arg abundance of biofilm was approximately 3 fold higher than that of river water fig 5 a indicating that args were enriched by biofilm the dominant arg types included multidrug args 22 03 mls 18 06 bacitracin 9 59 polymyxin 9 44 acriflavine 6 31 beta lactam 6 08 and aminoglycoside 5 81 fig 5b statistically 40 6 of the total 267 args were shared by all samples such as mls macb multidrug mdtb and acriflavine acrb fig 5c our sampling site haihe river is located in a high economically developed region and is a direct recipient of urban agricultural and industrial waste zhao et al 2010 the high antibiotic emissions in the haihe river region were verified in previous studies luo et al 2010 2011 the emission of antibiotics into the water ecosystem would contribute to the antibiotic resistance selection andersson and hughes 2011 which could explain the high diversity of args in biofilms cultured with water sampled from the haihe river many arg subtypes found in the microplastic biofilm were also previously detected using pcr methods such as ampc in wastewater volkmann et al 2004 teto tetq in lagoons smith et al 2004 sul1 sul2 blatem in

biofilm belonged to the multidrug resistance type which was also found to be dominant in other specific environments forsberg et al 2012 li et al 2015 zhu et al 2013 consistent with the results of previous studies reporting the presence of pseudomonas in hospital wastewater treatment plants and in drinking water carrying multidrug resistant genes ma et al 2016 we also found a high proportion of mdr genes in the microplastic biofilm the microplastic biofilm possessed arg subtypes not detected in the rock or leaf biofilms indicating that these args could not be loaded by natural particles specific types of args may be selectively enriched by the microplastic biofilm the extracellular substances in biofilms could be shared and the function of the cooperative interaction of biofilms would transport args between the cells via the biofilm matrix ostrowski et al 2011 direct leaf litter is one of the major sources of organic matter in the freshwater system and is rapidly colonized by microorganisms when entering the river environment most of the leaf leachate is composed of simple carbohydrates and may provide nutrients and carbon to the bacteria on the surface much of the microbial biomass in the river is located in biofilms lock et al 1984 as the first to encounter leachate from leaf mcarthur and colleagues showed that leaf biofilm influences the utilization of leaf leachate mcarthur et al 1985 the highest diversity of arg number of arg subtype in the leaf biofilm reminded us that leaves may be a natural source of args in the river environment in addition to microplastics we should also focus on the potential to transfer args inside the freshwater system a previous study based on a metagenomics analysis showed the exchange of args between clinical pathogens and environmental bacteria forsberg et al 2012 after verifying that the microplastic biofilm loads args it is essential to trace back the origin of the args and to identify which args were carried by which bacteria 3 5 microplastic biofilm selectively enriched opportunisitic human pathogens which carried args biofilms equip the microbial community with novel functions including increased resistance to antibiotics stewart and costerton 2001 after verifying that the bacteria in the microplastic biofilm indeed possessed genes with resistance to antibiotics questions remain about which bacteria possess these args and whether they pose a threat to human health to answer that question taxonomic annotation of arg bacterial hosts was conducted at the genus level we found that with the exception of the unclassified pluralibacter 18 97 pseudomonas 17 78 leclercia 11 71 and pantoea 11 06 are relatively abundant in all of the samples fig 7 a table s8 the proportions of the four genera in biofilm on three types of substrates are shown in fig 7b in both microplastic and rock biofilms the dominant host was pseudomonas with a proportion of 34 7 and 26 7 respectively while the largest proportion 20 9 in leaf biofilm was pantoea most of the hosts possessed multidrug resistance genes and aminoglycoside resistance genes fig 7c the multidrug resistance genes were carried by 50 9 50 2 46 8 of the host pseudomonas in the microplastic biofilm rock biofilm and leaf biofilm respectively table s9 the presence of pseudomonas in the microplastic biofilm was further verified by quantitative real time pcr of samples from three independent bioreactors see supplementary material for detailed data table s10 table s11 next host tracking analysis of the four major hosts pluralibacter pseudomonas leclercia and pantoea was conducted at the species level a number of the scaffolds carrying args were annotated to plant pathogens and human pathogens it should be noted that several pathogenic bacteria were only detected in microplastic biofilm but not in the rock or leaf biofilms fig 8 these pathogenic bacteria included pseudomonas monteilii an opportunistic pathogen more frequently detected in clinical environments and the major microbial species behind the disease of hypersensitivity pneumonitis and exacerbating bronchiectasis aditi et al 2017 bogaerts et al 2011 ocampo sosa et al 2015 pseudomonas mendocina an environmental bacterium causing opportunistic nosocomial infections such as infective endocarditis and spondylodiscitis chi et al 2005 mert et al 2007 and pseudomonas syringae an agriculturally important plant pathogen hirano and upper 2000 the microplastic biofilm selectively enriched these pathogens but no enrichment was observed in either rock or leaf biofilms as one of the most common plant pathogens p syringae has more than 60 pathovars and infects almost all economically important crop species xin et al 2018 in a previous study the outbreak of harmful alexandrium taylori algae bloom was shown to result from the attachment of a taylori cells to plastic debris maso et al 2003 the plant pathogens carried by microplastics may lead to pecuniary loss the existence of pathogens with args will increase the risk of antibiotic ineffectiveness because of the difficulty in treating the infection organic aggregates in water are islands for microbial assemblages and sometimes for pathogens lyons et al 2010 similarly microplastics could be considered as a much more durable island with high residence time under natural conditions microplastics in the river water environment may become the preferred surface for specific pathogens with other alternative natural particles existing in the same environment at the same time microplastics not only serve as a novel microhabitat for biofilm colonization but they also increase the likelihood of pathogens propagating the pathogens may have contact with humans along the river via direct exposure to the water area a number of questions remain to be addressed by future research including whether the architecture of the biofilm will remain complete after longer migration distances and greater geographic spread whether the microbial community structure will be continuously shaped because of environmental factors deviation in varied water environments and whether the pathogens in the biofilm remain hazardous and have an impact on local microbial communities 4 conclusions microplastics provide a unique microhabitat that supports the growth of specific bacterial consortia microplastic biofilms have a distinctive microbial community structure compared with biofilms formed on natural substrates as verified by taxon composition community separation pattern pcoa analysis otus with significantly different abundance and network relationships specific arg subtypes and several pathogenic bacterial hosts were also selectively enriched by microplastic biofilm microplastics could be viewed as a novel functionally important microhabitat in rivers and the dispersal of the microorganisms present within microplastic biofilms especially pathogenic microorganisms may enhance the risks to human health further studies are therefore required to establish the mechanism of horizontal gene transfer of args via microplastic biofilms this could pave the way for a more thorough understanding of the environmental behaviour and function of these anthropogenic particles in the freshwater ecosystem differences among the microplastic and biofilm and the natural particles have the potential to affect river environments in at least two ways first by introducing species into places where rock and leaf particles cannot reach and change the local community structure and second by transporting species including specific pathogens with tolerance to antibiotics downstream declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18512,disinfection is a key step in drinking water treatment process to prevent water borne infections however reactions between chlorine one of the most common disinfectants and natural organic matter nom often lead to the formation of hazardous disinfection byproducts dbps however the cytotoxicity of some dbps is still poorly understood such knowledge is critical for proper selection of disinfection processes we investigated the effects of dbps on mouse acute liver injury the exacerbation of liver damage increased with the dbps concentrations likely due to the increased hepatic macrophages haloacetonitriles hans and haloketones hks are more toxic to human hepatocellular hep3b cells than trihalomethanes thms cytotoxicity of dbps were governed by the halogen type brominated dbps chlorinated dbps and the numbers of halogen atoms per molecule then we used the pilot scale wds to study the best conditions for reducing the formation of dbps the result showed that the formation of dbps followed the order stainless steel ss ductile iron di polyethylene pe pipe higher flowrate promoted the formation of dbps in all three pipes the results suggest that the formation of dbps in chlorine disinfection can be reduced by using pe pipes and low flow rate in water distribution systems wds graphical abstract image 1 keywords water distribution system disinfection byproducts liver injury cytotoxicity hep3b cells 1 introduction drinking water disinfection has significantly reduced lethal diseases in humans from waterborne pathogens during the last century cutler and miller 2005 krasner et al 2009 however disinfection byproducts dbps were unintentionally formed when disinfectants reacted with natural organic matter nom and or bromide precursors in the source water krasner et al 2006 2009 over 600 dbps have been identified richardson et al 2007 however the u s environmental protection agency u s epa only regulate and monitor less than 20 dbps in water distribution systems wds boorman 1999 trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are the two most prevalent dbps formed in chlorination accounting for more than 25 of the total dbps the maximum concentration of thms and haas are regulated as 40 μg l and 30 μg l respectively in the united states usepa 2006 in previous study of dbps occurrence in european drinking water directive dwd thms was set as 100 μg l eu 1998 besides thms and haas many other dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans haloketones hks and halonitromethanes thnm were detected bond et al 2015 huang et al 2017 szczuka et al 2017 hiwate health impacts of long term exposure to dbps in drinking water was established in the european union eu in 2006 to evaluate the potential long term health risks of dbps nieuwenhuijsen et al 2009 thms exerted genotoxicity to chinese hamster ovary cho cells at 5 mm dong et al 2016 wagner and plewa 2017 besides haas were also showed to induce dna damage in cho cells and be mutagenic in salmonella typhimurium pfau et al 1999 plewa et al 2007 recently n dbps have attracted more interests because in vitro geno and cytotoxicity assays suggested that hans and thnm are significantly more toxic than the regulated thms muellner et al 2007 hans were showed to be carcinogenic and the lifetime risk of hans was calculated to be three times more potent than that of thms bull et al 2011 even though the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of most regular dbps to mammalian cells have been investigated bull et al 1985 muellner et al 2007 the knowledge is limited regarding the effects of dbp mixtures on acute liver injury besides the cytotoxicity of hans and hks to hepatocytes will be studied and compared with the toxicity of regulated thms and haas to gain more insights into their effects on liver injury ductile iron di polyethylene pe and stainless steel ss are widely used in the drinking water distribution systems wds throughout the world due to the required residual of free chlorine in wds dissolved organic matter dom microorganisms and inorganic substances in the water react with dissolved oxygen and disinfectants to promote the dbps formation in wds usher et al 2014 wang et al 2017 the mean concentration of thms ranged from zero in raw water samples to 950 μg l in treated water samples in nigeria benson et al 2017 in the united states up to 18 μg l of dbps were detected in finished water and up to 22 μg l dbps in distribution systems krasner et al 2006 in china the median concentrations of thms haas and hks over the entire period of treatment were 19 9 μg l 3 4 μg l and 1 4 μg l respectively huang et al 2017 therefore the concentrations of thms and haas in the wds are spatially variable li et al 2008 dong et al found that the flow rate could affect the chlorination reaction kinetics and the pipe materials could affect the decay of free chlorine dong et al 2017 wang et al found that pipe materials appeared to affect the formation potentials of the bacteria derived dbps wang et al 2013 because of the hazardous effects on human beings it is essential to explore more options to reduce the dbps formation potential in water treatment and distribution systems postigo et al 2018 the objectives of this study were to evaluate the formation and the toxicity of individual and mixed dbps in a pilot scale water distribution system and investigate factors affecting the formation of these dbps specifically this study aims to 1 develop and validate an analytical method to determine dbps in drinking water and wds 2 analyze the effects

results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of dbps in tap water and wds water of huzhou drinking water treatment plant to guide our investigation on the toxicity of dbp mixtures we first analyzed the dbps formation in the effluent of the huzhou drinking water treatment plant and the tap water from houses 5 km and 15 km downstream of the wds of the plant the location of different sampling points is showed in fig s3 the source water of the treatment plant was the taihu lake huzhou china the concentrations of free chlorine total organic carbon toc and bromide in water from different sampling points are showed in table s5 and table s6 thms and haas were the primary dbps detected in tap water and wds water accounting for 40 and 50 of the total dbps respectively fig 1 this was consistent with previous research that thms and haas were dominant dbps with chlorination xue et al 2014 due to the high concentration of br 150 10 μg l in source water bromide dbps such as dibromochloromethane dbcm bromodichloromethane bdcm bromochloroacetic bcaa and monobromoacetic acid mbaa were also detected compared with the concentrations of dbps in summer 30 2 c the dbps formation in winter 12 2 c was lower both in the treated water from the plant and the water sampled along the wds table s7 shows the characterization of source water in taihu lake during summer and winter the toc value in the summer and winter were 6 7 1 0 mg l and 4 5 1 0 mg l respectively lower toc in the winter was likely the reason for the low formation of dbps moreover the algae cells in the water samples during the summer and winter ranged from 2 0 107 to 3 0 107 cells l and from 0 5 107 to 0 8 107 cells l respectively the water samples in the summer contained more algae cells and nom which are important precursors of dbps therefore summer is the season requiring greater control of dbps especially in cyanobacterial blooms wert and rosario ortiz 2013 in addition the formation of dbps increased with the travelling distance in wds the dbps in samples taken at 5 km and 15 km along the wds were 1 5 1 8 times and 2 1 2 3 times higher than treated water from the treatment plant suggesting that the free chlorine residues in wds were still reactive these results agree with previous findings postigo et al 2018 and highlight the importance to control dbps formation in wds 3 2 the cytotoxicity of dbps con a as a protein targeting the liver was used for conventional animal immune hepatitis models since dbps were reported to have negative impact on metabolism and neuromechanism deng et al 2014 the effects of mixed dbps on con a induced liver injury and the cytotoxicity of mono dbps on hep 3b cells were performed 3 2 1 mixed dbps on con a induced liver injury in mice fig 2 a shows that the serum levels of alt and ast were both increased in con a induced liver injury test with dbps dosages increasing alt and ast represented the severity of liver damage released when liver cells were damaged at the dbps dosage of 500 ng 20g the concentrations of alt and ast markedly increased to about 15000 and 10000 u l fig 2b was the histological examination of liver injury in mice which shows the area of liver damage increased with the dbps concentrations increasing in which the dark red part was the area of liver damage histological examination showed diffuse and massive degenerative liver alterations at the dbps dosage of 200 ng 20g and 500 ng 20g compared with the mild necrosis and lymphocyte infiltration without dbps suggesting that mixed dbps could exacerbate the liver injury to investigate the effects of immune cells on liver injury aggravations the apoptosis of the total liver tissue and hepatic mononuclear cells was both analyzed fig 3 a represents the apoptosis of liver cell the blue region shows the total cells and the green region shows tunnel positive which represented the apoptotic cells generally the apoptosis rate tunnel positive of the whole liver increased with the increase of the concentration of dbps which was consistent with the histological examination results we further examined the distribution of liver mononuclear cells fig 3b generally early apoptosis only shows annexin v while late apoptosis often shows double positive of annexin v and pi necrosis often caused cell death directly which shows pi single positive however the survival rates of the total liver mononuclear cells were almost unchanged when the dbps increased from 0 to 500 ng 20g as shown in fig 3c the percentages of macrophages were 10 9 17 3 and 24 4 at the dbps dosages of 0 200 and 500 ng 20g respectively fig 3d and fig s4 showed the percentages of hepatic t cells and natural killer nk cells in mice with con a induced liver damage the sum of f4 80 nk 1 1 tcr beta were close to 80 of the lymphocytes in the liver which can more comprehensively reflect the impact of dbps on liver immunity the proportions of t cells and nk cells weren t markedly changed in addition phosphate buffer saline pbs as a negative control for con a was also investigated in fig s5 the result shows that dbps did not directly damage the liver and macrophages did not change significantly therefore higher mixed dbps solutions could exacerbate con a induced liver injury in mice most likely through increased hepatic macrophages 3 2 2 the cytotoxicity of mixed dbps solution against hep3b as dbps exacerbated con a induced liver injury in mice a human hepatocyte cell line hep3b was used to further analyze the cytotoxicity of mixed dbps fig 4 shows the cytotoxicity of mixed dbps solutions at different dosages against hep3b cells the survival rate of hep3b cells was 91 2 without dbps q4 in fig 4a when hep3b cells were cultured at only 10 ng ml mixed dbps solution the survival rate was stable at 89 6 q4 in fig 4b suggesting that the low concentration of dbps had little effect on the survival of hep3b cells at the mixed dbps dose of 50 and 250 ng ml the survival rate of hep3b cells dropped to 79 9 and 71 6 respectively q4 in fig 4 when the mixed dbps increased to 500 ng ml the survival rate of hep3b cells significantly decreased to 40 7 indicating that the cytotoxicity of mixed dbps solutions to hep3b is dose dependent 3 2 3 the cytotoxicity of mono dbps fig 4 shows that the apoptosis rate of hep3b cells in q3 region increased from 3 9 to 52 5 with the concentration increased from 0 to 500 ng ml however the necrosis rate fluctuated with concentration it is still unknown whether the reduction of hep3b survival rate was mainly caused by apoptosis or necrosis previous studies have proved the liver toxicity and carcinogenicity of thms however limited research is available in the literature on the cytotoxicity of hans hks and tca on hep3b cells fig 5 a d depicts the response curves of hep3b to hans hks tca haas and thms in the concentration range of 0 2000 ng ml the results illustrate a well defined dose dependent effect of individual dbps on the survival of hep3b cells after 72 h of exposure for the five individual hans the survival rate of hep3b cells from exposure to 2000 ng ml of can dcan tcan ban and bcan were 81 5 74 7 65 1 60 8 and 43 2 respectively the apoptosis of the hep3b cell under the same concentration of mono hans followed the order of chronic cytotoxicity as bcan ban tcan dcan can the cytotoxicity of dcp tcp and tca is showed in fig 5b all of them were detected in the water samples in this study dcp and tca showed similar cytotoxicity against hep3b cells when the concentrations were below 500 ng ml while hep3b cells seemed to be more sensitive to dcp when the concentrations were above 500 ng ml compared with dcp tcp displayed higher cytotoxicity to hep3b cells fig 5c and d shows the cytotoxicity of five haas mcaa mbaa dcaa bcaa and tcaa and four thms tbm tcm dbcm and bdcm to hep3b cells the hep3b cells were most sensitive to tbm extracts at the exposure concentration from 0 to 2000 ng ml when concentrations were below 1000 ng ml tcm dbcm and bdcm had similar cytotoxicity to hep3b cells the cytotoxicity of thms 2000 ng ml to hep3b cells follows the order of tbm tcm bdcm dbcm consistent with the results of chronic cho cell cytotoxicity karanfil et al 2008 among haas tcaa had the strongest cytotoxicity to hep3b cells based on the survival rate the cytotoxicity of five haas follows the order of tcaa bcaa dcaa mbaa mcaa in general the selected dbps showed different cytotoxicity against hep3b cells compared with thms hans led to higher death rate of hep3b cells hks displayed similar cytotoxicity as hans at high exposure concentrations but hks were more toxic than hans at low exposure concentrations besides haas exhibited the highest cytotoxic potency among target dbps putting together the cytotoxicity of all targeted dbps against the hep3b follows the rank of tcaa bcan tcp bcaa dcaa mbaa dcp ban mcaa tcan tbm tcm bdcm tca dbcm dcan can these results provide essential information for evaluating in vivo cytotoxicity of dbps and their related compounds 3 2 4 structure toxicity relationships affecting the toxicity of dbps four haas mcaa dcaa mbaa and bcaa were selected to investigate the structure toxicity relationships str between dbps and hep3b cells as shown in fig 6 at lower concentration 10 ng ml the death rate of hep3b caused by mbaa and bcaa was higher than mcaa and dcaa fig 6a brominated dbps are more hazardous to hep3b cells than chlorinated dbps fig 6a c illustrates the death distribution of hep3b cells due to apoptosis and necrosis respectively at low medium and high concentration fig s6 shows flow cytometric images depicting the state of cells after exposure to haas the cell death was primarily due to apoptosis for mbaa and bcaa while necrosis was the main reason of death caused by mcaa and dcaa when the concentration increased to 100 ng ml the death rates increased for all dbps fig 6b mbaa and bcaa caused higher death rate than mcaa and dcaa interestingly while mbaa and bcaa caused both apoptosis and necrosis to a similar extent the death caused by mcaa and dcaa was predominantly from apoptosis at even higher exposure concentration 500 ng ml mcaa and dcaa exhibited similar toxicity as mbaa and bcaa fig 6c indicating that the toxicological advantage of brominated dbps to chlorinated dbps gradually disappeared although the death rate of brominated dbp was unchanged between 100 and 500 ng ml the necrosis rate obviously increased indicating stronger lethality at higher concentration however the increased death induced by chlorinated dbps was mainly apoptosis clearly the halogenation patterns had a strong effect on dbps cytotoxicity to hep3b cells at all tested concentrations the brominated dbps were more toxic than chlorinated dbps moreover the toxicity increased when the number of halogen atoms increased per molecule richardson et al 2007 brominated dbps were also more mutagenic than the chlorinated dbps which is consistent with a previous study about the cytotoxicity of haas to cho cells plewa et al 2002 in vitro systematic and comparative toxicity of dbps could provide more information for choosing chlorine disinfection in our drinking water 3 3 factors affecting the formation of dbps in wds due to the occurrence of dbps in actual wds and the high toxicity of hans haas and hks on hep 3b cells two primary factors the pipe materials including bacteria structure and the flowrate in the wds were investigated for their effects on dbps formation 3 3 1 effect of pipe materials on dbps formation fig 7 shows the formation of dbps in different pipe materials of wds di pe and ss pipe at a flowrate of 1 0 m s and temperature of 25 c the initial concentration of free chlorine was 0 75 mg l and no additional nom was added in wds fig 7a and b shows the increase of four thms and four haas with migration time in all three pipes which indicated that thms and haas could be stable in the presence of free chlorines as the final dbps thms were mostly formed in the di pipe and their formation was similar in the ss and pe pipes haas formation was unaffected by the pipe materials in addition to thms and haas there were some undesirable nitrogenous dbps such as tcnm dcan and tcan fig 7c although the concentration of individual dbps were all less than 2 μg l it could not be ignored interestingly dcan dcp and tcp increased first and then decreased with the reaction time as shown in fig 7c besides bromide dbps tbm bdcm dbcm and bcaa were formed more than chlorine dbps tcm mcaa bcaa and tcaa in all three pipes fig s7 shows the formation of dbps during chlorination in batch test thms and haas both increased with the reaction time increasing compared with the dbps formation in wds the batch test resulted in a much lower amount of dbps than in the wds because there was no entry of other nom according to the total yield dbps fig s7d the main reaction happened at the first 6 h and the yield of dbps in di pe ss pipe and batch test increased from 13 8 11 7 12 5 and 11 1 μg l to 31 7 23 1 26 6 and 15 6 μg l respectively moreover the concentration of dbps after 24 h followed the order di 31 8 μg l ss 28 2 μg l pe 24 5 μg l batch test 16 7 μg l compared with the batch test chlorine containing water can produce more dbps in all three pipe materials the ductile iron pipe was the easiest to produce a large amount of dbps during the water transportation and the safest material was the pe pipe the formation of dbps in wds was influenced by a variety of factors such as nom biofilms bromide and iron higher nom in pipe would result in greater formation of dbps due to their reactions with more free chlorine the toc measurements in ss 3 02 mg l pe 2 54 mg l and di 4 76 mg l pipe was consistent with the decay of free chlorine and dbps formation in fig s8 compared with the initial dbps concentrations 0 h dbps increased by 30 8 and 25 in di pe and ss pipes respectively at 24 h due to the high concentration of br in three pipes table s2 free chlorine could be quickly oxidized with br to form hypo bromous acid hobr k 1550 1 m s deborde and von gunten 2008 the presence of both hobr hocl may further react with nom to generate numerous chlorinated and brominated dbps richardson and postigo 2011 it has been reported that hobr is more reactive with olefins carboxylic acids alcohols ketones and aldehydes heeb et al 2014 moreover the hydrolysis rate constant of dcan dcp and tcp is 1 37 1 55 and 4 22 10 6 s 1 respctively suggesting that these dbps could be decomposed over time reckhow et al 1990 therefore dcp could be oxidized to tcp when the free chlorine was available and tcp could be hydrolyzed to tcaa and tcm previous study has reported the growth of biofilms in wds was greatly affected by pipe materials dong et al 2018 we investigated the bacterial community and diversity in three different pipes to further investigate the effect of pipe materials on the dbps formation based on the diversity index of shannon and otu numbers detected in different pipe materials table s7 pe pipe had the highest otu richness in addition pe pipe had the highest bacterial diversity as expressed by shannon index of 9 29 while ss pipe showed the lowest level of bacterial diversity with a shannon index of 8 98 pe pipe could promote bacterial growth through releasing biodegradable organic compounds yu et al 2010 fig 7d shows the dehalogenation related bacteria in different pipe materials previous studies had confirmed that methylobacterium hyphomicrobium pseudomonas mycobacterium and xanthobacter could promote the reduction of dbps in suitable conditions jang et al 2012 mcrae et al 2004 wang et al 2017 the dominant bacteria were methylobacterium and mycobacterium in all three pipes the total relative abundance of the dehalogenation related bacteria followed the order pe 9 38 ss 5 03 di 3 59 the dehalogenation related bacteria in pipe walls may degrade dbps our results showed lowest dbps formation in pe pipe among the three pipe materials suggesting that the differences in microbial community composition in different pipes contribute to the observed differences in dbps in these pipes 3 3 2 effect of flowrates in wds on dbps formation to estimate the influence of hydraulic conditions on the formation of dbps in wds the flowrates in wds were 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m s respectively the reactions were carried out at di pe and ss pipes with 0 75 mg l of free chlorine concentration 25 c of temperature and 7 4 0 2 of ph at different flow rates fig 8 a c shows the formation of dbps increased with the flowrates in all three types of pipes when the flowrate increased from 0 5 m s to 1 5 m s the concentration of dbps increased 38 6 36 7 and 42 5 in di pe and ss pipes respectively fig 8d shows the decay of free chlorine at three different flowrates suggesting that the high flow rate could promote the consumption of free chlorine the convective mass transfer coefficient was used to compare the impact of mass transfer caused by different flowrates in wds in this study the transfer coefficient was calculated based on the formula proposed by soninet al sonin and probstein 1968 and supported by experimental studies cong et al 2012 the reynolds number re sherwood number sh and schmidt number sc were described as follows and the results were displayed in table s8 1 r e ρ u d μ 2 s c μ ρ d l 3 s h k f d d l 3 3 l d r e s c 1 3 where k f was the mass transfer coefficient m s d was the length of the wds hydrodynamic characteristic length of the reactor 80 m d l was the molecular diffusivity of chlorine in water 4 17 10 6 m2 h at 20 c u was the fluid velocity m s ρ was the fluid density kg m3 and μ was the fluid dynamic viscosity 1 01 10 3 pa s the mass transfer coefficient k f increased from 0 013 m s to 0 018 m s when the flowrates increased from 0 5 m s to 1 5 m s table s8 the results suggest that higher flowrate promoted mass transfer high flowrate also enhanced the reaction efficiency between free chlorine and nom in pipe therefore the increasing flowrate promoted the formation of dbps in three different pipes 4 conclusions this study reported the occurrence and comparative toxicity of individual dbps as well as their mixtures in the water distribution system major findings of the study include 1 increased hepatic macrophages was the predominant reason for the exacerbated con a induced liver injury when mice were exposed to the mixture of dbps solutions hans hks tca thms and haas 2 hans and hks resulted in greater death rate of hep3b cells than thms and tca and the toxicity was affected by the halogen types and halogen atoms per molecule bromine containing dbps are generally more toxic than chlorine containing dbps and higher halogen atoms per molecules leads to greater toxicity 3 pipe materials played a significant role in dbps formation the dbp formation was highest in stainless steel pipes ss followed by ductile iron di and then polyethylene pe pipes for the water used in this study 4 higher flowrate promoted the formation of dbps in three types of pipes in summary we confirmed the toxicity of dbps investigated the underlying mechanisms of toxicity for different dbps and associated their toxicity to their molecular structures for a practical point of view the dbp formation is a greater concern in the hot weather than cold weather proper selection of pipe materials and flow rate can lower the formation of dbps declaration of competing interest the authors

18512,disinfection is a key step in drinking water treatment process to prevent water borne infections however reactions between chlorine one of the most common disinfectants and natural organic matter nom often lead to the formation of hazardous disinfection byproducts dbps however the cytotoxicity of some dbps is still poorly understood such knowledge is critical for proper selection of disinfection processes we investigated the effects of dbps on mouse acute liver injury the exacerbation of liver damage increased with the dbps concentrations likely due to the increased hepatic macrophages haloacetonitriles hans and haloketones hks are more toxic to human hepatocellular hep3b cells than trihalomethanes thms cytotoxicity of dbps were governed by the halogen type brominated dbps chlorinated dbps and the numbers of halogen atoms per molecule then we used the pilot scale wds to study the best conditions for reducing the formation of dbps the result showed that the formation of dbps followed the order stainless steel ss ductile iron di polyethylene pe pipe higher flowrate promoted the formation of dbps in all three pipes the results suggest that the formation of dbps in chlorine disinfection can be reduced by using pe pipes and low flow rate in water distribution systems wds graphical abstract image 1 keywords water distribution system disinfection byproducts liver injury cytotoxicity hep3b cells 1 introduction drinking water disinfection has significantly reduced lethal diseases in humans from waterborne pathogens during the last century cutler and miller 2005 krasner et al 2009 however disinfection byproducts dbps were unintentionally formed when disinfectants reacted with natural organic matter nom and or bromide precursors in the source water krasner et al 2006 2009 over 600 dbps have been identified richardson et al 2007 however the u s environmental protection agency u s epa only regulate and monitor less than 20 dbps in water distribution systems wds boorman 1999 trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are the two most prevalent dbps formed in chlorination accounting for more than 25 of the total dbps the maximum concentration of thms and haas are regulated as 40 μg l and 30 μg l respectively in the united states usepa 2006 in previous study of dbps occurrence in european drinking water directive dwd thms was set as 100 μg l eu 1998 besides thms and haas many other dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans haloketones hks and halonitromethanes thnm were detected bond et al 2015 huang et al 2017 szczuka et al 2017 hiwate health impacts of long term exposure to dbps in drinking water was established in the european union eu in 2006 to evaluate the potential long term health risks of dbps nieuwenhuijsen et al 2009 thms exerted genotoxicity to chinese hamster ovary cho cells at 5 mm dong et al 2016 wagner and plewa 2017 besides haas were also showed to induce dna damage in cho cells and be mutagenic in salmonella typhimurium pfau et al 1999 plewa et al 2007 recently n dbps have attracted more interests because in vitro geno and cytotoxicity assays suggested that hans and thnm are significantly more toxic than the regulated thms muellner et al 2007 hans were showed to be carcinogenic and the lifetime risk of hans was calculated to be three times more potent than that of thms bull et al 2011 even though the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of most regular dbps to mammalian cells have been investigated bull et al 1985 muellner et al 2007 the knowledge is limited regarding the effects of dbp mixtures on acute liver injury besides the cytotoxicity of hans and hks to hepatocytes will be studied and compared with the toxicity of regulated thms and haas to gain more insights into their effects on liver injury ductile iron di polyethylene pe and stainless steel ss are widely used in the drinking water distribution systems wds throughout the world due to the required residual of free chlorine in wds dissolved organic matter dom microorganisms and inorganic substances in the water react with dissolved oxygen and disinfectants to promote the dbps formation in wds usher et al 2014 wang et al 2017 the mean concentration of thms ranged from zero in raw water samples to 950 μg l in treated water samples in nigeria benson et al 2017 in the united states up to 18 μg l of dbps were detected in finished water and up to 22 μg l dbps in distribution systems krasner et al 2006 in china the median concentrations of thms haas and hks over the entire period of treatment were 19 9 μg l 3 4 μg l and 1 4 μg l respectively huang et al 2017 therefore the concentrations of thms and haas in the wds are spatially variable li et al 2008 dong et al found that the flow rate could affect the chlorination reaction kinetics and the pipe materials could affect the decay of free chlorine dong et al 2017 wang et al found that pipe materials appeared to affect the formation potentials of the bacteria derived dbps wang et al 2013 because of the hazardous effects on human beings it is essential to explore more options to reduce the dbps formation potential in water treatment and distribution systems postigo et al 2018 the objectives of this study were to evaluate the formation and the toxicity of individual and mixed dbps in a pilot scale water distribution system and investigate factors affecting the formation of these dbps specifically this study aims to 1 develop and validate an analytical method to determine dbps in drinking water and wds 2 analyze the effects of mixed dbps on acute liver injury 3 analyze and compare the in vitro cytotoxicity of hans hks haas and thms against human hepatic cell hep3b cells and 4 investigate the effect of pipe materials and

conducted using a pilot scale wds in zhejiang university this system contained three types of pipe materials ductile iron di polyethylene pe and stainless steel ss fig s1 the wds water was from

analyzed every two days and typical values of the water are tabulated in table s2 the simulate dbps formation experiments were divided into two parts in the wds tests the initial concentration of free chlorine was 0 75 mg l flow velocities 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m s were adjusted by the automatic controls in the system to investigate the influence of flow rate on dbps formation samples were collected at

results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of dbps in tap water and wds water of huzhou drinking water treatment plant to guide our investigation on the toxicity of dbp mixtures we first analyzed the dbps formation in the effluent of the huzhou drinking water treatment plant and the tap water from houses 5 km and 15 km downstream of the wds of the plant the location of different sampling points is showed in fig s3 the source water of the treatment plant was the taihu lake huzhou china the concentrations of free chlorine total organic carbon toc and bromide in water from different sampling points are showed in table s5 and table s6 thms and haas were the primary dbps detected in tap water and wds water accounting for 40 and 50 of the total dbps respectively fig 1 this was consistent with previous research that thms and haas were dominant dbps with chlorination xue et al 2014 due to the high concentration of br 150 10 μg l in source water bromide dbps such as dibromochloromethane dbcm bromodichloromethane bdcm bromochloroacetic bcaa and monobromoacetic acid mbaa were also detected compared with the concentrations of dbps in summer 30 2 c the dbps formation in winter 12 2 c was lower both in the treated water from the plant and the water sampled along the wds table s7 shows the characterization of source water in taihu lake during summer and winter the toc value in the summer and winter were 6 7 1 0 mg l and 4 5 1 0 mg l respectively lower toc in the winter was likely the reason for the low formation of dbps moreover the algae cells in the water samples during the summer and winter ranged from 2 0 107 to 3 0 107 cells l and from 0 5 107 to 0 8 107 cells l respectively the water samples in the summer contained more algae cells and nom which are important precursors of dbps therefore summer is the season requiring greater control of dbps especially in cyanobacterial blooms wert and rosario ortiz 2013 in addition the formation of dbps increased with the travelling distance in wds the dbps in samples taken at 5 km and 15 km along the wds were 1 5 1 8 times and 2 1 2 3 times higher than treated water from the treatment plant suggesting that the free chlorine residues in wds were still reactive these results agree with previous findings postigo et al 2018 and highlight the importance to control dbps formation in wds 3 2 the cytotoxicity of dbps con a as a protein targeting the liver was used for conventional animal immune hepatitis models since dbps were reported to have negative impact on metabolism and neuromechanism deng et al 2014 the effects of mixed dbps on con a induced liver injury and the cytotoxicity of mono dbps on hep 3b cells were performed 3 2 1 mixed dbps on con a induced liver injury in mice fig 2 a shows that the serum levels of alt and ast were both increased in con a induced liver injury test with dbps dosages increasing alt and ast represented the severity of liver damage released when liver cells were damaged at the dbps dosage of 500 ng 20g the concentrations of alt and ast markedly increased to about 15000 and 10000 u l fig 2b was the histological examination of liver injury in mice which shows the area of liver damage increased with the dbps concentrations increasing in which the dark red part was the area of liver damage histological examination showed diffuse and massive degenerative liver alterations at the dbps dosage of 200 ng 20g and 500 ng 20g compared with the mild necrosis and lymphocyte infiltration without dbps suggesting that mixed dbps could exacerbate the liver injury to investigate the effects of immune cells on liver injury aggravations the apoptosis of the total liver tissue and hepatic mononuclear cells was both analyzed fig 3 a represents the apoptosis of liver cell the blue region shows the total cells and the green region shows tunnel positive which represented the apoptotic cells generally the apoptosis rate tunnel positive of the whole liver increased with the increase of the concentration of dbps which was consistent with the histological examination results we further examined the distribution of liver mononuclear cells fig 3b generally early apoptosis only shows annexin v while late apoptosis often shows double positive of annexin v and pi necrosis often caused cell death directly which shows pi single positive however the survival rates of the total liver mononuclear cells were almost unchanged when the dbps increased from 0 to 500 ng 20g as shown in fig 3c the percentages of macrophages were 10 9 17 3 and 24 4 at the dbps dosages of 0 200 and 500 ng 20g respectively fig 3d and fig s4 showed the percentages of hepatic t cells and natural killer nk cells in mice with con a induced liver damage the sum of f4 80 nk 1 1 tcr beta were close to 80 of the lymphocytes in the liver which can more comprehensively reflect the impact of dbps on liver immunity the proportions of t cells and nk cells weren t markedly changed in addition phosphate buffer saline pbs as a negative control for con a was also investigated in fig s5 the result shows that dbps did not directly damage the liver and macrophages did not change significantly therefore higher mixed dbps solutions could exacerbate con a induced liver injury in mice most likely through increased hepatic macrophages 3 2 2 the cytotoxicity of mixed dbps solution against hep3b as dbps exacerbated con a induced liver injury in mice a human hepatocyte cell line hep3b was used to further analyze the cytotoxicity of mixed dbps fig 4 shows the cytotoxicity of mixed dbps solutions at different dosages against hep3b cells the survival rate of hep3b cells was 91 2 without dbps q4 in fig 4a when hep3b cells were cultured at only 10 ng ml mixed dbps solution the survival rate was stable at 89 6 q4 in fig 4b suggesting that the low concentration of dbps had little effect on the survival of hep3b cells at the mixed dbps dose of 50 and 250 ng ml the survival rate of hep3b cells dropped to 79 9 and 71 6 respectively q4 in fig 4 when the mixed dbps increased to 500 ng ml the survival rate of hep3b cells significantly decreased to 40 7 indicating that the cytotoxicity of mixed dbps solutions to hep3b is dose dependent 3 2 3 the cytotoxicity of mono dbps fig 4 shows that the apoptosis rate of hep3b cells in q3 region increased from 3 9 to 52 5 with the concentration increased from 0 to 500 ng ml however the necrosis rate fluctuated with concentration it is still unknown whether the reduction of hep3b survival rate was mainly caused by apoptosis or necrosis previous studies have proved the liver toxicity and carcinogenicity of thms however limited research is available in the literature on the cytotoxicity of hans hks and tca on hep3b cells fig 5 a d depicts the response curves of hep3b to hans hks tca haas and thms in the concentration range of 0 2000 ng ml the results illustrate a well defined dose dependent effect of individual dbps on the survival of hep3b cells after 72 h of exposure for the five individual hans the survival rate of hep3b cells from exposure to 2000 ng ml of can dcan tcan ban and bcan were 81 5 74 7 65 1 60 8 and 43 2 respectively the apoptosis of the hep3b cell under the same concentration of mono hans followed the order of chronic cytotoxicity as bcan ban tcan dcan can the cytotoxicity of dcp tcp and tca is showed in fig 5b all of them were detected in the water samples in this study dcp and tca showed similar cytotoxicity against hep3b cells when the concentrations were below 500 ng ml while hep3b cells seemed to be more sensitive to dcp when the concentrations were above 500 ng ml compared with dcp tcp displayed higher cytotoxicity to hep3b cells fig 5c and d shows the cytotoxicity of five haas mcaa mbaa dcaa bcaa and tcaa and four thms tbm tcm dbcm and bdcm to hep3b cells the hep3b cells were most sensitive to tbm extracts at the exposure concentration from 0 to 2000 ng ml when concentrations were below 1000 ng ml tcm dbcm and bdcm had similar cytotoxicity to hep3b cells the cytotoxicity of thms 2000 ng ml to hep3b cells follows the order of tbm tcm bdcm dbcm consistent with the results of chronic cho cell cytotoxicity karanfil et al 2008 among haas tcaa had the strongest cytotoxicity to hep3b cells based on the survival rate the cytotoxicity of five haas follows the order of tcaa bcaa dcaa mbaa mcaa in general the selected dbps showed different cytotoxicity against hep3b cells compared with thms hans led to higher death rate of hep3b cells hks displayed similar cytotoxicity as hans at high exposure concentrations but hks were more toxic than hans at low exposure concentrations besides haas exhibited the highest cytotoxic potency among target dbps putting together the cytotoxicity of all targeted dbps against the hep3b follows the rank of tcaa bcan tcp bcaa dcaa mbaa dcp ban mcaa tcan tbm tcm bdcm tca dbcm dcan can these results provide essential information for evaluating in vivo cytotoxicity of dbps and their related compounds 3 2 4 structure toxicity relationships affecting the toxicity of dbps four haas mcaa dcaa mbaa and bcaa were selected to investigate the structure toxicity relationships str between dbps and hep3b cells as shown in fig 6 at lower concentration 10 ng ml the death rate of hep3b caused by mbaa and bcaa was higher than mcaa and dcaa fig 6a brominated dbps are more hazardous to hep3b cells than chlorinated dbps fig 6a c illustrates the death distribution of hep3b cells due to apoptosis and necrosis respectively at low medium and high concentration fig s6 shows flow cytometric images depicting the state of cells after exposure to haas the cell death was primarily due to apoptosis for mbaa and bcaa while necrosis was the main reason of death caused by mcaa and dcaa when the concentration increased to 100 ng ml the death rates increased for all dbps fig 6b mbaa and bcaa caused higher death rate than mcaa and dcaa interestingly while mbaa and bcaa caused both apoptosis and necrosis to a similar extent the death caused by mcaa and dcaa was predominantly from apoptosis at even higher exposure concentration 500 ng ml mcaa and dcaa exhibited similar toxicity as mbaa and bcaa fig 6c indicating that the toxicological advantage of brominated dbps to chlorinated dbps gradually disappeared although the death rate of brominated dbp was unchanged between 100 and 500 ng ml the necrosis rate obviously increased indicating stronger lethality at higher concentration however the increased death induced by chlorinated dbps was mainly apoptosis clearly the halogenation patterns had a strong effect on dbps cytotoxicity to hep3b cells at all tested concentrations the brominated dbps were more toxic than chlorinated dbps moreover the toxicity increased when the number of halogen atoms increased per molecule richardson et al 2007 brominated dbps were also more mutagenic than the chlorinated dbps which is consistent with a previous study about the cytotoxicity of haas to cho cells plewa et al 2002 in vitro systematic and comparative toxicity of dbps could provide more information for choosing chlorine disinfection in our drinking water 3 3 factors affecting the formation of dbps in wds due to the occurrence of dbps in actual wds and the high toxicity of hans haas and hks on hep 3b cells two primary factors the pipe materials including bacteria structure and the flowrate in the wds were investigated for their effects on dbps formation 3 3 1 effect of pipe materials on dbps formation fig 7 shows the formation of dbps in different pipe materials of wds di pe and ss pipe at a flowrate of 1 0 m s and temperature of 25 c the initial concentration of free chlorine was 0 75 mg l and no additional nom was added in wds fig 7a and b shows the increase of four thms and four haas with migration time in all three pipes which indicated that thms and haas could be stable in the presence of free chlorines as the final dbps thms were mostly formed in the di pipe and their formation was similar in the ss and pe pipes haas formation was unaffected by the pipe materials in addition to thms and haas there were some undesirable nitrogenous dbps such as tcnm dcan and tcan fig 7c although the concentration of individual dbps were all less than 2 μg l it could not be ignored interestingly dcan dcp and tcp increased first and then decreased with the reaction time as shown in fig 7c besides bromide dbps tbm bdcm dbcm and bcaa were formed more than chlorine dbps tcm mcaa bcaa and tcaa in all three pipes fig s7 shows the formation of dbps during chlorination in batch test thms and haas both increased with the reaction time increasing compared with the dbps formation in wds the batch test resulted in a much lower amount of dbps than in the wds because there was no entry of other nom according to the total yield dbps fig s7d the main reaction happened at the first 6 h and the yield of dbps in di pe ss pipe and batch test increased from 13 8 11 7 12 5 and 11 1 μg l to 31 7 23 1 26 6 and 15 6 μg l respectively moreover the concentration of dbps after 24 h followed the order di 31 8 μg l ss 28 2 μg l pe 24 5 μg l batch test 16 7 μg l compared with the batch test chlorine containing water can produce more dbps in all three pipe materials the ductile iron pipe was the easiest to produce a large amount of dbps during the water transportation and the safest material was the pe pipe the formation of dbps in wds was influenced by a variety of factors such as nom biofilms bromide and iron higher nom in pipe would result in greater formation of dbps due to their reactions with more free chlorine the toc measurements in ss 3 02 mg l pe 2 54 mg l and di 4 76 mg l pipe was consistent with the decay of free chlorine and dbps formation in fig s8 compared with the initial dbps concentrations 0 h dbps increased by 30 8 and 25 in di pe and ss pipes respectively at 24 h due to the high concentration of br in three pipes table s2 free chlorine could be quickly oxidized with br to form hypo bromous acid hobr k 1550 1 m s deborde and von gunten 2008 the presence of both hobr hocl may further react with nom to generate numerous chlorinated and brominated dbps richardson and postigo 2011 it has been reported that hobr is more reactive with olefins carboxylic acids alcohols ketones and aldehydes heeb et al 2014 moreover the hydrolysis rate constant of dcan dcp and tcp is 1 37 1 55 and 4 22 10 6 s 1 respctively suggesting that these dbps could be decomposed over time reckhow et al 1990 therefore dcp could be oxidized to tcp when the free chlorine was available and tcp could be hydrolyzed to tcaa and tcm previous study has reported the growth of biofilms in wds was greatly affected by pipe materials dong et al 2018 we investigated the bacterial community and diversity in three different pipes to further investigate the effect of pipe materials on the dbps formation based on the diversity index of shannon and otu numbers detected in different pipe materials table s7 pe pipe had the highest otu richness in addition pe pipe had the highest bacterial diversity as expressed by shannon index of 9 29 while ss pipe showed the lowest level of bacterial diversity with a shannon index of 8 98 pe pipe could promote bacterial growth through releasing biodegradable organic compounds yu et al 2010 fig 7d shows the dehalogenation related bacteria in different pipe materials previous studies had confirmed that methylobacterium hyphomicrobium pseudomonas mycobacterium and xanthobacter could promote the reduction of dbps in suitable conditions jang et al 2012 mcrae et al 2004 wang et al 2017 the dominant bacteria were methylobacterium and mycobacterium in all three pipes the total relative abundance of the dehalogenation related bacteria followed the order pe 9 38 ss 5 03 di 3 59 the dehalogenation related bacteria in pipe walls may degrade dbps our results showed lowest dbps formation in pe pipe among the three pipe materials suggesting that the differences in microbial community composition in different pipes contribute to the observed differences in dbps in these pipes 3 3 2 effect of flowrates in wds on dbps formation to estimate the influence of hydraulic conditions on the formation of dbps in wds the flowrates in wds were 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m s respectively the reactions were carried out at di pe and ss pipes with 0 75 mg l of free chlorine concentration 25 c of temperature and 7 4 0 2 of ph at different flow rates fig 8 a c shows the formation of dbps increased with the flowrates in all three types of pipes when the flowrate increased from 0 5 m s to 1 5 m s the concentration of dbps increased 38 6 36 7 and 42 5 in di pe and ss pipes respectively fig 8d shows the decay of free chlorine at three different flowrates suggesting that the high flow rate could promote the consumption of free chlorine the convective mass transfer coefficient was used to compare the impact of mass transfer caused by different flowrates in wds in this study the transfer coefficient was calculated based on the formula proposed by soninet al sonin and probstein 1968 and supported by experimental studies cong et al 2012 the reynolds number re sherwood number sh and schmidt number sc were described as follows and the results were displayed in table s8 1 r e ρ u d μ 2 s c μ ρ d l 3 s h k f d d l 3 3 l d r e s c 1 3 where k f was the mass transfer coefficient m s d was the length of the wds hydrodynamic characteristic length of the reactor 80 m d l was the molecular diffusivity of chlorine in water 4 17 10 6 m2 h at 20 c u was the fluid velocity m s ρ was the fluid density kg m3 and μ was the fluid dynamic viscosity 1 01 10 3 pa s the mass transfer coefficient k f increased from 0 013 m s to 0 018 m s when the flowrates increased from 0 5 m s to 1 5 m s table s8 the results suggest that higher flowrate promoted mass transfer high flowrate also enhanced the reaction efficiency between free chlorine and nom in pipe therefore the increasing flowrate promoted the formation of dbps in three different pipes 4 conclusions this study reported the occurrence and comparative toxicity of individual dbps as well as their mixtures in the water distribution system major findings of the study include 1 increased hepatic macrophages was the predominant reason for the exacerbated con a induced liver injury when mice were exposed to the mixture of dbps solutions hans hks tca thms and haas 2 hans and hks resulted in greater death rate of hep3b cells than thms and tca and the toxicity was affected by the halogen types and halogen atoms per molecule bromine containing dbps are generally more toxic than chlorine containing dbps and higher halogen atoms per molecules leads to greater toxicity 3 pipe materials played a significant role in dbps formation the dbp formation was highest in stainless steel pipes ss followed by ductile iron di and then polyethylene pe pipes for the water used in this study 4 higher flowrate promoted the formation of dbps in three types of pipes in summary we confirmed the toxicity of dbps investigated the underlying mechanisms of toxicity for different dbps and associated their toxicity to their molecular structures for a practical point of view the dbp formation is a greater concern in the hot weather than cold weather proper selection of pipe materials and flow rate can lower the formation of dbps declaration of competing interest the authors

18513,mass transfer from nonaqueous phase liquid napl to entrapped air induced by a fluctuating water table commonly occurs in residual napl zones in aquifers gas bubble expansion and vertical migration due to interphase mass transfer could facilitate the upward transport of volatile organic compounds vocs in the aquifer and result in higher mass fluxes into a building relative to those of diffusion limited d l voc transport however the current vapor intrusion models have not considered bubble migration in this study an analytical solution of bubble facilitated b f voc transport in the unsaturated saturated zone was developed the analytical solution was tested by a numerical solution using the finite difference method sensitivity analyses of model parameters were implemented to understand the voc transport behaviors the effects of bubble migration on vapor intrusion pathway completion time t c and the attenuation factor af were investigated by comparison with the d l voc transport model the results indicate that the d l model significantly overestimates the t c and underestimates the af because the model neglects the impacts of bubble migration therefore one may make an inappropriate decision and set up an inappropriate response action schedule if using the d l model to assess the risk of bubble facilitated vapor intrusion the analytical solution was applied to a laboratory experiment the analytical model managed to interpret the laboratory experiment data showing that the mass flux of b f voc transport is two orders of magnitude higher than that of d l voc

contaminated soil or groundwater through the soil and into the indoor air of a building usepa 2015 see fig 1 vapor intrusion could pose unacceptable human health risks such as raising the lifetime risks of cancer or chronic disease tillman and weaver 2007 and inducing adverse birth outcomes forand et al 2012 recent studies suggest that there are over 100 000 contaminated sites in the u s with the potential for vapor intrusion to occur collier et al 2011 suitable mathematical models can provide an acceptable line of evidence supporting risk management decisions concerning vapor intrusion usepa 2015 studies concerning modeling gas flow in the unsaturated zone you et al 2011a 2011b provide a good basis for modeling vapor intrusion early vapor intrusion models were built based on pesticide transport and radon intrusion models yao et al 2013a johnson and ettinger 1991 presented the first major modeling effort of vapor intrusion and developed the johnson and ettinger j e model in 1991 in the j e model the diffusion mechanism in soil was assumed to dominate the volatile organic compound voc transport in the vadose zone and the effective diffusion coefficient was estimated by the millinton quirk equation millington and quirk 1960 jury et al 1983 the advection caused by the indoor outdoor air pressure difference affected only a small area beneath the building foundation yao et al 2013a and the entry air flow rate was estimated by the nazaroff equation nazaroff 1988 which was first presented in the radon intrusion model currently the j e model is widely employed to predict the vapor intrusion exposure risks at hazardous waste sites as a screening tool since the j e model a number of analytical and numerical models have been proposed based on the former model by taking into account biogeochemical processes to investigate vapor intrusion these developed mathematical models are commonly used to investigate the impact factors of vapor intrusion including source concentration abreu et al 2009 vertical abreu et al 2009 picone et al 2012 and horizontal distances lowell and eklund 2004 yu et al 2009 water content tillman and weaver 2007 shen et al 2012 2013a b bekele et al 2018 yao et al 2019 atteia and hohener 2010 soil heterogeneity yu et al 2009 bozkurt et al 2009 yao et al 2017a soil texture yao et al 2017b 2018 biodegradation abreu et al 2009 abreu and johnson 2006 devaull et al 2002 2007 foundation type mills et al 2007 wind shirazi and pennell 2017 indoor air pressure and indoor outdoor air exchange rate shen and suuberg 2016 picone et al 2012 conducted the numerical simulations with contaminant sources below or above the water table the results indicated that the subslab voc concentration when the source located below the water table is lower than that when source located above the water table shen et al 2012 investigated the effects of rainfall on the vapor intrusion they found that a clean water lens accumulated above the napl source after the rainfall event and led to a capping effect which can reduce diffusion rates of voc from the source yao et al 2017b 2018 2019 investigated the effects of soil texture on the vapor intrusion they found that the texture of the soil in the top of the unsaturated zone has the significant impacts on the indoor voc concentration while the texture of the soil in the bottom of the unsaturated zone has negligible impacts the capillary fringe offered a main resistance to the voc transport a clean water lens is commonly regarded as an extra diffusion barrier to voc transport in the subsurface environment shen et al 2012 mchugh et al 2017 a water table rise induced by a precipitation event would establish a clean water lens atop a nonaqueous phase liquid napl source illangasekare et al 2014 shen et al 2012 that exists in the aquifer a significant concentration gradient in the saturated zone atop the napl source was observed at field sites guo 2015 in laboratory experiments illangasekare et al 2014 yao et al 2013b and in mathematical models picone et al 2012 shen et al 2012 yao et al 2013b because of the small diffusion coefficients of vocs in saturated soil approximately 10 6 cm2 s a portion of the napl in the aquifer would be trapped with air due to water table wt fluctuations in the smear zone johnson 1993 hack et al 2015 vocs from trapped napl and air will form bubbles below the wt see fig 1 mass transfers from trapped and dissolved napl to the bubbles cause the air pressure in the bubbles to increase the bubbles begin to expand when the inner gas pressure overcomes the sum of the water and capillary entry pressures the continued expansion of bubbles results in fragmentation and mobilization of the bubbles when the buoyancy force exceeds the sum of the capillary and viscous forces as observed in laboratory experiments roy and smith 2007 mumford et al 2009a b 2010 bubbles are continually produced from the smear zone induced by this mode the bubbles migrate upward forced by the buoyancy force in the saturated zone until they arrive at the wt which can be regarded as a special case of particle transport in porous media wan et al 2001 this process may be completed within a very short time since the bubble rise velocity could be up to 25 cm s haberman and morton 1953 roosevelt and corapcioglu 1998 corapcioglu et al 2004 in the aquifer the bubbles will burst immediately and vocs inside will spread into the above vadose zone when the bubbles cross the wt the latter results in a much higher vapor concentration above the wt relative to the dissolved voc diffusion concentration in the saturated zone soucy and mumford 2017 recently studied the potential effects of this bubble facilitated b f voc transport on vapor intrusion by laboratory experiments a roughly two orders of magnitude higher mass flux was observed in their experiments relative to that of diffusion limited d l voc transport in addition voc transport is much quicker under b f conditions relative to d l voc transport the vapor attenuation factors afs and screening levels of vocs are important parameters in the risk assessment of vapor intrusion the recommended values of these parameters in the risk assessment guidance issued by the usepa are commonly calculated using the d l voc transport model usepa 2015 on the findings of soucy and mumford 2017 however the recommended afs and screening levels calculated by the d l model may be inappropriate since the model neglects the b f mechanism this approach may result in underestimations of the exposure concentration and time and cause health risk threats to the occupants in a building to the best of our knowledge b f voc transport has not been considered in current mathematical models in this study we developed an analytical solution of voc transport in the unsaturated saturated zone by considering bubble migration in the saturated zone the analytical solution was tested using a finite difference numerical solution sensitivity analysis of the parameters was implemented the effects of bubble migration on the af and vapor intrusion pathway completion time t c were investigated the analytical solution was applied to the laboratory experiments of soucy and mumford 2017 2 methods 2 1 mathematical model fig 1 illustrates the b f voc transport in the unsaturated saturated zone the napl source with trapped air is located under the wt at a constant distance z l 1 after expansion fragmentation and migration the air bubbles fill with vocs the bubbles will be transported into the clean saturated zone l 1 z 0 induced by the buoyancy force the bubble transport behaviors are analogous to particle advection dispersions in the saturated zone the bubbles will burst immediately and vocs inside will spread into the above vadose zone when the bubbles cross the wt z 0 vocs will migrate upward in the unsaturated zone by diffusion after reaching the subslab zone z l 2 vocs then leak into the building through cracks in the foundation due to the advection mechanism induced by the indoor outdoor pressure difference the bubble transport in the saturated zone can be treated as a special case of colloid transport in porous media wan et al 2001 therefore the governing equations of the bubble transport in the saturated zone can be written as follows 1a θ b t u b θ b z d b 2 θ b z 2 l 1 z 0 1b θ b z 0 0 1c θ b l 1 t θ b 0 1d θ b z z 0 0 where θ b is the volume fraction of bubbles to porous media l 3 l 3 u b is the bubble advection velocity l t and d b is the bubble dispersion coefficient l 2 t bubble migration is controlled by the interplay of buoyancy viscous and capillary forces and not affected by the above unsaturated zone hence the nonflux boundary condition eq 1d was used on the wt in this study we assume that the interphase mass transfer between the dissolved vocs in the smear zone and the voc vapor in the bubbles attains the equilibrium state therefore the voc concentration in each bubble equals a constant value c b m l 3 that is determined by the dissolved voc concentration c 0 m l 3 in the smear zone the relationship between c b and c 0 satisfies c b h c 0 where h is henry s constant the gas phase concentrations are influenced by the concentrations of other dissolved gases when the main source of the gas in bubbles is dissolved gas in water cirpka and kitanidis 2001 geistlinger et al 2005 however voc in bubbles mainly comes from napl ganglia rather than dissolved voc in the smear zone the concentration of dissolved voc is determined by the napl ganglia as well the impacts of other dissolved gases in the aqueous and gas phases should be limited because the mass transfers of aqueous gas phase are not important relative to the mass transfers of napl gas and napl water in addition according to the observations of gas expansion and mobilization experiments mumford et al 2009a b 2010 the speed of gas expansion or bubble formation is slow therefore it is reasonable to assume that the aqueous and gas phase voc concentrations are in equilibrium during the gas expansion the average voc concentration c b in an arbitrary cross section of the saturated zone above the smear zone is represented by c b θ b c b mass transfer of voc between bubbles and water during the bubble upward migration is neglected with the assumption that the bubble mobilization is much faster than gas dissolution mumford et al 2010 in addition the aqueous diffusion of voc in the saturated zone is neglected and only voc in bubbles is considered in the b f model this is because the diffusive mass flux is very small relative to the voc transport by bubble migration according to the experimental results soucy and mumford 2017 in the unsaturated zone diffusion is usually the main mechanism determining the voc transport the advection caused by the indoor outdoor air pressure difference only affects a small area beneath the building foundation yao et al 2013a there are three common building foundation types basement crawl space and slab on grade this work only concerns slab on grade situations the voc concentration and mass flux across the cracks are assumed to equal those in the subslab soil this assumption is employed in the definition of the upper boundary condition z l 2 hence the governing equation of the voc transport in the unsaturated zone can be written as the following diffusion equation 2a c g t d e 2 c g z 2 0 z l 2 2b c g z 0 0 2c c g 0 t θ b 0 t θ g c b 2d a b d e c g z q c k c g z l 2 0 where c g is the soil gas concentration m l 3 d e is the effective porous medium diffusion coefficient of vocs in the unsaturated zone l 2 t θ g is the air filled porosity l 3 l 3 a b is the cross sectional area of the building foundation l 2 and q c k is the soil gas volumetric entry flow rate l 3 t it should be noted that mass continuity is assumed at the wt and described by eq 2c the effective diffusion coefficient can be estimated by the millinton quirk equation millington and quirk 1960 jury et al 1983 as follows 3 d e d g θ g 10 3 θ t 2 d w θ w 10 3 h θ t 2 where d g is the diffusion coefficient of vocs in air l 2 t d w is the diffusion coefficient of vocs in water l 2 t θ w is the water filled porosity l 3 l 3 and θ t is the total porosity l 3 l 3 the air flow rate into cracks can be estimated by the nazaroff equation nazaroff 1988 as follows 4 q c k 2 π k δ p l c k μ g l n 2 d f w c k where q c k is the soil gas entry flow rate l 3 t k is the soil permeability l 2 δ p is the soil indoor air pressure difference m l t 2 l c k is the length of a perimeter crack l μ g is the viscosity of the soil gas m l t d f is the depth of the foundation l and w c k is the width of the crack l for simplification of the equations we represent the bubble concentration with the average voc concentration c b the voc concentration in the saturated zone is c b hereinafter for consistency we also define the following variables c g θ g c g and c 0 θ t c 0 therefore eqs 1 and 2 can be rearranged as follows below for the saturated zone 5a c b t u b c b z d b 2 c b z 2 l 1 z 0 5b c b z 0 0 5c c b l 1 t c b 0 5d c b z z 0 0 where c b 0 θ b 0 c b s b 0 h c 0 and s b 0 θ b 0 θ t is the bubble saturation that is the fraction of the bubble volume to the porosity to avoid confusion c b 0 is referred to as the gas phase boundary concentration and c 0 is referred to as the aqueous phase boundary concentration hereinafter we only consider the voc transport with the bubble migration in equation 5a therefore the voc concentration in the bottom boundary is assigned as c b 0 rather than c 0 for the unsaturated zone 6a c g t d e 2 c g z 2 0 z l 2 6b c g z 0 0 6c c g 0 t c b 0 t 6d d e c g z q c g z l 2 0 where d e d e θ g and q q c k a b θ g representing the soil gas entry flux l t a b is the cross sectional area of the building foundation l2 2 2 analytical solution the laplace domain solutions of eqs 5a and 6a subject to initial conditions 5b and 6b and boundary conditions 5c 5d 6c and 6d are given as follows 7a c 1 d z d s a exp α β z d b exp α β z d 7b c 2 d z s m exp γ z d n exp γ z d where the subscript d denotes the dimensionless terms hereinafter the definitions of all dimensionless variables are included in the supporting information s1 s is the laplace transform parameter with respect to the dimensionless time a b m n α β and γ are z d independent variables and their definitions can be found in the supporting information s1 the overbar denotes a variable in the laplace domain hereinafter the details of the derivation of the laplace domain solutions 7a and 7b are presented in s1 it is difficult to obtain closed form solutions by analytically inverting the laplace transforms of these solutions the numerical inverse laplace method is commonly used such as the zakian method zakian 1969 stehfest method stehfest et al 1970 talbot algorithm talbot 1979 fourier series method dubner and abate 1968 crump technique crump 1976 and the de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 a suitable performance of the de hoog algorithm was found for the unsaturated and saturated flow problems in the literature liang et al 2017 2018 therefore the de hoog algorithm was employed to invert the laplace solutions into time domain solutions in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison with the numerical solution to test the validity of the fundamental solution 7 it was compared with numerical solutions of eqs 5 and 6 that were solved by the finite difference method the details are shown in the supporting information s3 a dimensionless parameter set was chosen for the test as follows p 10 d d 0 1 q d 1 a n d l d 0 5 where p is the dimensionless bubble advection velocity and is defined as p u b l 2 d e d d is the dimensionless dispersion coefficient and is defined as d d d b d e q d is the dimensionless soil gas entry flux and is defined as q d q l 2 d e and l d is the dimensionless saturated zone thickness and is defined as l d l 1 l 2 this case with the parameter set was also employed as the reference scenario for the sensitivity analysis in the next section the studied space and time ranges are 0 5 z d 1 and 10 3 t d 10 the number of grid nodes is 601 and the space step is 0 0025 the number of time steps is 1000000 and the time step is 10 5 fig 2 displays the comparison of the analytical and numerical solutions the analytical results show a suitable qualitative agreement with the numerical results the above comparison indicates that the solutions of this study appear to be sufficiently accurate and robust to predict the voc transport in the unsaturated saturated zone fig 2a presents the temporal evolution of the voc concentrations at the middle positions of the saturated z d 0 25 and unsaturated zones z d 0 5 as mentioned previously the rising of bubbles is driven by the buoyancy force and is independent of the vapor transport in the above saturated zone therefore the gas phase voc concentration in the entire saturated zone will increase up to the source concentration in contrast vocs are transported by diffusion in the unsaturated zone hence the voc concentration cannot reach the source concentration in addition the gas phase voc concentration in the saturated zone reaches a maximum value within a very short time relative to that in the unsaturated zone this result is because the bubble migration is faster than the voc diffusion in the unsaturated zone the contaminant concentration profiles at different moments are shown in fig 2b at t d 0 02 bubbles have not arrived at the wt and therefore no vocs are observed in the unsaturated zone the gas phase voc concentration in the whole saturated zone gradually increases up to the source concentration with time the voc concentration in the unsaturated zone also increases with time the voc transport will attain a steady state at t d 2 at this point the voc concentration in the unsaturated zone becomes linear with the distance from the wt 3 2 sensitivity analysis of the model parameters to investigate the impacts of the voc transport parameters and the saturated zone thickness a sensitivity analysis of the dimensionless parameters p d d q d and l d is conducted in this section a sensitivity analysis is also recommended by the usepa before using a mathematical model to investigate vapor intrusion usepa 2015 fig 3 displays the effects of p d d q d and l d on the voc breakthrough curves and concentration profiles where the other parameter values are constant and the same as in fig 2 with increasing p vocs break through at the monitoring points faster in both the saturated and unsaturated zone at early time fig 3a the voc concentrations for different p values finally reach constant values 1 0 for the saturated zone and 0 75 for the unsaturated zone this result means that the voc concentration is independent of the p when the voc transport reaches its steady state this phenomenon is also observed in the concentration profiles fig 3b with the d d increasing we can find that vocs arrive at the two monitoring points earlier however it takes longer to reach the maximum concentration fig 3c similar to the p the d d does not change the maximum concentrations at the two monitoring points 1 0 for the saturated zone and 0 75 for the unsaturated zone and steady state vertical profiles fig 3c and d the effect is different from the impacts of p and d d while the q d does not affect the voc concentration of the saturated zone fig 3e and f the reason is that the variation in q d has no impact on bubble migration in the saturated zone however the q d affects the voc concentrations in the unsaturated zone at later times and the plateau concentration increases with decreasing q d fig 3e and f in fig 3g we can find that vocs can be detected earlier at the two monitoring points for a smaller l d and it takes less time to reach the maximum concentration the maximum concentration did not vary with the l d 1 0 for the saturated zone and 0 75 for the unsaturated zone in general the p and d d determine the transport capacity and the l d is the transport distance in the saturated zone therefore the parameters have impacts on the voc travel time according to the mass flux continuity supporting information s5 the relative concentration in the unsaturated zone at the steady state can be written as follows 8 c 2 d z d 1 1 z d q d 1 q d z d 0 where c 2 d is the relative concentration in the unsaturated zone eq 8 indicates that c 2 d is dependent on q d and z d and independent of p d d and l d at the steady state that is observed in fig 2 as well 3 3 application to the laboratory experiments soucy and mumford 2017 conducted a series of column experiments to study the potential effects of b f voc transport on vapor intrusion the column was composed of four sections including a smear zone z 10 cm a saturated zone 10 cm z 0 an unsaturated zone 0 z 10 cm and a section without a porous medium that acts as a pathway for air flow across the unsaturated zone the thicknesses of both the saturated and unsaturated zones equal 10 cm l 1 l 2 10 c m a column that contained air napl and water in the smear zone was employed in the b f voc transport experiments in addition for comparison the d l voc transport experiments were conducted in a column that contained only napl and water in the smear zone the air flows across the unsaturated zone were equal to 60 and 11 ml min for the b f and d l voc transport experiments respectively a horizontal water flow was applied in the source zone to simulate the groundwater flow in the b f experiment while there was no horizontal water flow in the d l experiment the dissolved voc concentration in the source zone in the b f experiment would be expected to be much lower than that in the d l experiment due to the dilution effect of waterflow pentane was used as voc in the experiments and its physical chemical properties are presented in table s1 of the supporting information s4 the observed mass fluxes of this experiment are presented in the supporting information s4 the details of the experiment can be found in the paper of soucy and mumford 2017 and soucy s master dissertation 2016 the analytical model proposed in this work was applied to the experiments fig 4 shows the breakthrough curves at the column outlet and the vertical voc concentration profiles in the column predicted by the analytical solutions as well as the comparison of the experiment data and analytical solutions of the mass fluxes at the column outlet to compare with the b f voc transport the analytical solution of the d l voc transport was derived by the laplace method which is presented in appendix it should be noted that for the d l model the voc only transported in water in the saturated zone therefore the aqueous phase boundary concentration c 0 is used as the boundary condition that is different from the b f model the boundary concentrations of the b f and d l voc transport experiments are estimated by fitting the observed breakthrough curves with the analytical solutions the estimated gas phase boundary concentration c b 0 for the b f experiment is 1 9 mg l the estimated aqueous phase boundary concentration c 0 for the d l experiment is 11 6 mg l that approaches the solubility limit of voc 12 9 mg l fig 4a indicates that the voc migrates rapidly in the column under the b f condition the effluent concentration reaches its maximum value 0 47 mg l within 0 1 day in contrast the voc transport under the d l condition is considerably slower relative to the b f voc transport the effluent concentration reaches its maximum value 0 025 mg l within 15 days the much higher effluent concentration was obtained in the b f model with a boundary concentration of 1 9 mg l the d l model cannot produce such a high effluent concentration unless the aqueous phase boundary concentration exceeds the solubility limit of voc that is not reasonable in addition the much less voc breakthrough time of the b f model displayed in fig 4a indicates that the transport time scale of the bubble migration is considerably smaller than that of voc diffusion in water this phenomenon was also observed in the gas expansion and mobilization experiment in soucy and mumford 2017 these results suggested that the analytical model is suitable to interpret the observed physical phenomena the significantly shorter transport time of the b f voc transport is ascribed to the relatively high u b of 0 0022 cm s that is estimated according to the description of the bubble transport soucy and mumford 2017 the transport time of the bubble migration can be estimated by t u b l 1 u b equal to 0 053 day in contrast the diffusion of the dissolved pentane in the saturated zone is very slow with a diffusion coefficient of 8 07 10 6 cm2 s in water the transport time of the dissolved voc diffusion can be estimated by t d w l 1 2 d w equal to 11 97 days where d w represents the effective diffusion coefficient in saturated porous media fig 4b shows the concentration profiles in the columns of the b f and d l voc transport experiments the b f voc transport has a much higher effluent concentration owing to the absence of a decrease in concentration in the saturated zone as for the d l voc transport the concentration drops dramatically in the saturated zone since the diffusion coefficient in water is very small similar concentration profiles were found in the capillary fringes by previous studies yao et al 2019 atteia and hohener 2010 shen et al 2012 2013a in contrast the decrease in concentration in the unsaturated zone is nearly negligible for the d l voc transport in general a high concentration at the outlet of the column can be observed within a very short time for the b f voc transport experiment in contrast to the experiment under d l conditions the results of the column experiments demonstrate the importance of bubble migration on the voc transport in the subsurface and the b f voc transport may increase the vapor intrusion risks at sites 3 4 vapor intrusion pathway completion time and attenuation factor the usepa states that cleanup actions should be undertaken when the vapor exposure pathway is complete and the human health risks are above certain risk levels usepa 2015 the usepa proposed five conditions to identify whether the vapor intrusion pathway can be referred to as complete for a building one of the conditions is expressed as one or more vapor forming chemicals comprising the subsurface vapor source s is or are present in the indoor environment hence two parameters that are independent from the source concentration the characteristic time t c and the a f are employed to characterize the vapor intrusion scenarios in this work picone et al 2012 the characteristic time gives an indication of the time of vapor intrusion completion and the urgency of remedial actions and t c is calculated as the time at which the subslab soil gas concentration equals half of the maximum concentration c t c 0 5 c s s where c s s is the contaminant subslab concentration at the steady state the af is defined as the ratio of the subslab voc concentration to the source concentration a f c s s c 0 the monitored a f in a site investigation is a very important factor in the multiple lines of evidence mle for vapor intrusion assessment in practice usepa 2015 the above results indicate that bubble migration can considerably enhance the voc transport in the subsurface to further investigate the impacts of bubble migration on vapor intrusion the a f and t c are calculated using the b f and d l voc transport models respectively the value ranges of the parameters employed in the simulations are displayed in table 1 which are determined according to the previous literature roosevelt and corapcioglu 1998 measured the u b in a saturated column filled with 4 mm glass beads the researchers measurements showed that u b increased from 5 2 to 25 cm s with the bubble size which is similar to the experimental findings of bubbles rising in water haberman and morton 1953 very slow bubble migrations were observed in the spontaneous gas expansion experiments roy and smith 2007 mumford et al 2009a 2010 haberman and morton 1953 the lowest u b is approximately 2 10 5 cm s estimated by experimental images at different times mumford et al 2010 in the experiments of roosevelt and corapcioglu 1998 the upper bound of bubble velocity is 25 cm s owing to the bubbles produced by the air injection in gravel sized media in this study the bubbles in the napl source zone are produced by gas expansion and mobilization and the velocity cannot attain such a large value therefore the upper bound of bubble velocity is set as 10 cm s it should be noted that the bound of the bubble velocity has little impacts on estimations of vapor intrusion pathway completion time for the b f model this is because the bubble migration time in the saturated zone is very small relative to the voc migration time in the unsaturated zone when the bubble velocity approaches the upper bound hence u b varying from 2 10 5 to 10 cm s is adopted by this study the d b can be calculated by the equation d b α b u b where α b is the bubble dispersivity l the value of α b is set to 0 1 1 cm in this study according to the literature concerning particle transport in saturated porous media chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 bradford et al 2002 ahfir et al 2016 hence the d b varies from 2 10 6 to 10 cm2 s for the d e because this study focuses on the comparison of two modes of voc transport in the saturated zone the influence of the soil moisture is not considered here hence the value of d e is set to 0 01 0 1 cm2 s according to the d g values of common vocs d w is the diffusion coefficient of vocs in saturated porous media and is defined as d w d w θ t 1 3 it should be noted that a six orders of magnitude variation in the bubble rise velocity in the saturated zone was observed in the previous literature the voc travel time in the aquifer under b f conditions is mainly dependent on the u b the soil texture has a significant impact on the bubble velocity for gas flow in saturated porous media the flow rate is determined by the particle size distribution psd gas flow has two patterns in porous media continuous channel flow and discontinuous cluster or bubble flow a critical flow rate exists as q c r i t π δ ρ g r c 4 8 μ g geistlinger et al 2006 where q c r i t is the critical gas flow rate l 3 t δ ρ is the density difference between air and water m l 3 g is the gravity acceleration constant l t 2 r c is the gas channel radius l and μ g is the gas dynamic viscosity stable gas channels form as the flow rate is superior to the critical rate otherwise gas migrates in the form of clusters or bubbles the r c is highly dependent on the particle size hence the soil texture is an important factor for the gas flow pattern on the other hand for bubble flow the height of a bubble can be estimated by h b b o 1 d p stöhr and khalili 2006 where b o is the bond number and d p is the particle diameter l this equation means that the soil psd determines the bubble size distribution the bubble rise velocity in a porous medium was observed to be a function of the bubble size in the literature roosevelt and corapcioglu 1998 haberman and morton 1953 tsuchiya et al 1997 this relationship was further confirmed by corapcioglu et al 2004 using an analytical solution as a consequence the soil psd determines the bubble size distribution and therefore the velocity distributions u b and d b simulations with different u b d b d w and l 1 values were conducted to compare the t c values predicted by the two models we fixed l 2 2 m d e 0 02 c m 2 s and q 0 005 c m s in these simulations since the b f and d l voc transports have similar vapor migration processes in the unsaturated zone the t c of the simulations with the b f model t c b varies from 3 39 to 61 66 days while the t c of the simulations with the d l model t c d varies from 29 51 to 16218 1 days this result indicates that the variation range of t c d is much wider than that of t c b and t c d is much larger than t c b generally therefore it is inappropriate to use the d l model to predict whether the vapor intrusion pathway is complete to investigate the effects of the transport parameters on the difference of the t c values predicted by the two models a dimensionless variable φ 8 d w u b l 1 is introduced here where φ represents the ratio of the travel time of bubble advection t u b l 1 u b to that of voc diffusion in the saturated zone t d w l 1 2 8 d w it should be noted that advection dominates the bubble migration in the saturated zone due to p e u b l 1 d b 10 therefore bubble dispersion is not considered when calculating the travel time fig 5 a shows that t c b t c d increases with φ this finding implies that the difference between t c b and t c d increases with decreasing d w and increasing u b and l 1 usually the d w values of vocs vary within one order of magnitude gharagheizi 2012 therefore the voc travel time in the saturated zone under d l conditions is mainly determined by the thickness of the aquifer above the smear zone l 1 as mentioned above a f is defined as the ratio of the voc subslab concentration to the source concentration in a vapor intrusion site the dissolved voc concentration c 0 in the groundwater can be measured directly which can be regarded as the source concentration usepa 2015 therefore we used c 0 as the source concentration when calculating the af of the b f and d l models the af values of the b f and d l voc transports can be calculated according to the continuity of the mass flux s6 as follows 9 a f b s b 0 h d e l 2 q d e and 10 a f d h 1 q d w l 1 h q d e l 2 where d w is the diffusion coefficient in a saturated porous medium which is defined as millington and quirk 1960 jury et al 1983 d w d w θ t 1 3 usually q d w l 1 h q d e l 2 1 because the d w is very small therefore the a f d can be approximated by a f d d w q l 1 and the impacts of h and d e on the a f d are neglected the ratio of a f b to a f d can be written as follows based on eqs 9 and 10 11 a f b a f d s b 0 d w d e d e h l 1 q d w l 2 q d w l 2 q d e a f b varies from 8 45 10 4 to 9 71 10 2 while a f d varies from 1 97 10 6 to 1 6 10 2 a f b is much larger than a f d generally to investigate the effects of the transport parameters on the difference of the a f values predicted by the two models a dimensionless variable ω s b 0 h d e d w l 1 l 2 is introduced here fig 5b shows that the a f b a f d ratio rises linearly with the increase in ω the difference between a f b and a f d becomes larger with increasing s b 0 h d e and l 1 and decreasing d w and l 2 the a f b will be four orders of magnitude larger than the a f d when ω reaches its maximum value this result means that the neglection of bubble migration would probably result in underestimation of the vapor intrusion concentration the ratio of d e d w is very high and varies from 2 5 103 to 2 5 105 this finding reflects that the voc transport in the unsaturated zone is much faster than that in the saturated zone by diffusion therefore the clean water lens atop the contaminant source is considered to act as a diffusive barrier shen et al 2012 mchugh et al 2017 however this study indicates that the damping effects of the water lens will become much weaker in the presence of bubble migration in addition a f b a f d increases with the l 1 which means that a deep contaminant source under the wt may induce a large deviation between the predicted concentration by the d l model and the actual concentration 3 5 implications the aboveesults indicate that the d l voc transport model will underestimate the af and overestimate the t c due to neglecting bubble migration this kind of inaccurate estimation of the two parameters could mislead the site manager to make a wrong decision in practice the usepa vapor intrusion guidance states that at properties where the subsurface concentrations of vocs fall below the vapor intrusion screening levels visls no further action or study is warranted usepa 2015 however the use of recommended a f s and visls calculated by the d l model are inappropriate for risk assessment in the presence of bubble migration in the saturated zone on the other hand significant overestimation of the t c would induce incorrect predictions of the pathway completion time and urgency of the response action as a consequence the project team may set up an inappropriate schedule of response actions e g remediation of the source this situation would increase the exposure times to the contaminant vapor of the building occupants e g residents and workers according to the guidance for soil screening of the usepa in 2001 usepa 2002 2004 the cancer risk is estimated as the following relationship 12 c r u r f e f e d c i n d o o r a t where cr is the increased lifetime cancer risk urf is the inhalation unit risk factor m l 3 ef is the exposure frequency t t ed is the exposure duration t c i n d o o r is the indoor air concentration m l3 and at is the averaging time t neglecting bubble migration would induce significant underestimations of c i n d o o r and extra ed fig 5 therefore predictions using the d l model would increase the threats to the health of occupants in a building however the b f voc transport model developed in this study supplies an efficient mathematical tool to investigate the potential effects of bubble migration on vapor intrusion 3 6 limitations of the analytical model there are several limitations that should be addressed for better application of this study first we assumed the effective diffusion coefficient of the analytical models was a constant which is dependent on the soil moisture the soil moisture varies with space and time in practice resulting in that the effective diffusion coefficient is varying in space and time as well shen et al 2013a investigated the effects of the variation of soil moisture on the concentration profile of voc in the soil the results indicated that the variation in soil moisture has nonnegligible impacts on the concentration profile especially for sand however it is a significant challenge to solve the diffusion equation with a spatiotemporally dependent diffusion coefficient analytically which will be investigated in future second in this study the gas phase boundary concentration c b 0 is obtained by fitting experimental data rather than by the measurements because it is difficult to directly measure the saturation of the bubble formed by the gas expansion s b 0 mumford et al 2010 conducted a numerical simulation of the gas expansion and mobilization above a napl pool using macroscopic invasion percolation techniques it is analogous to the bubble formation in the source zone of this study the work of mumford et al inspires us to develop a practical method to calculate s b 0 in future third the mass transfer of voc between bubbles and water during the bubble migration is neglected in this study based on an assumption that the voc dissolution is much slower than the bubble mobilization mumford et al 2010 however holocher et al 2003 observed that a trapped bubble with a radius of 0 35 mm would be completely dissolved in 3 7 days indicating that the mass transfer of voc between bubbles and water is nonnegligible when the bubbles migration is slow therefore to more accurately describe the voc transport in the saturated zone the mass transfer of voc between bubbles and water needs to be considered in a case of low bubble velocity in future finally a rapid rise of bubbles would result in the gas advection in the vicinity of the water table to consider this advective mechanism the diffusion model adopted by this study to describe the voc transport in the unsaturated zone should be replaced with an advection diffusion model however this advection diffusion model is difficult to solve analytically because the advection velocity arising from the high gas pressure in the water table is varied with time and space therefore this process has not been considered in our analytical model such a limitation exists in most studies with analytical approach 4 conclusions in this study an analytical model of the bubble facilitated b f vapor intrusion was developed to investigate the effects of upward bubble migration in the saturated zone on the vapor intrusion in contrast to the diffusion limited d l model the b f model takes into account the bubble migration in the aquifer first the analytical solution was tested by a numerical solution the sensitivity analysis of the model parameters was carried out to understand the voc transport under b f conditions then the b f model was applied to a laboratory experiment finally the effects of the bubble migration on attenuation factor af and characteristic time t c were investigated by comparing the results predicted by the b f model and the d l model in a variety of scenarios the conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 according to the sensitivity analyses of the model parameters the bubble advection velocity dispersion coefficient and the thickness of the saturated zone have impacts on the voc travel time under b f conditions however the final concentration at the steady state only depends on the soil gas entry flux into the building 2 the b f model managed to reproduce the results of the two order of magnitude higher mass flux at the column outlet relative to that of the d l voc transport the boundary concentrations in the b f and d l models are estimated by fitting the measured mass flux at the outlet with the analytical models 3 for the b f voc transport no concentration decrease occurred in the saturated zone at the steady state by contrast a four order of magnitude decrease of concentration in the aquifer was observed under d l conditions therefore the bubble upward migration can considerably enhance the voc transport in the subsurface environment 4 the t c predicted by the b f model t c b varies from 3 39 to 61 66 days while the t c predicted by the d l model t c d varies from 29 51 to 16218 1 days the a f predicted by the b f model a f b varies from 8 45 10 4 to 9 71 10 2 while the a f predicted by the d l model a f d varies from 1 97 10 6 to 1 6 10 2 therefore the d l model would significantly overestimate t c and underestimate af in the presence of the bubble migration in the saturated zone consequently the site manager in charge of a vapor intrusion site may make an inappropriate decision since the current vapor intrusion screen levels in the guides are calculated under d l conditions acknowledgments this study was partially supported by research grants from the national natural science foundation of china 41830861 41330314 the national key project water pollution

18513,mass transfer from nonaqueous phase liquid napl to entrapped air induced by a fluctuating water table commonly occurs in residual napl zones in aquifers gas bubble expansion and vertical migration due to interphase mass transfer could facilitate the upward transport of volatile organic compounds vocs in the aquifer and result in higher mass fluxes into a building relative to those of diffusion limited d l voc transport however the current vapor intrusion models have not considered bubble migration in this study an analytical solution of bubble facilitated b f voc transport in the unsaturated saturated zone was developed the analytical solution was tested by a numerical solution using the finite difference method sensitivity analyses of model parameters were implemented to understand the voc transport behaviors the effects of bubble migration on vapor intrusion pathway completion time t c and the attenuation factor af were investigated by comparison with the d l voc transport model the results indicate that the d l model significantly overestimates the t c and underestimates the af because the model neglects the impacts of bubble migration therefore one may make an inappropriate decision and set up an inappropriate response action schedule if using the d l model to assess the risk of bubble facilitated vapor intrusion the analytical solution was applied to a laboratory experiment the analytical model managed to interpret the laboratory experiment data showing that the mass flux of b f voc transport is two orders of magnitude higher than that of d l voc

contaminated soil or groundwater through the soil and into the indoor air of a building usepa 2015 see fig 1 vapor intrusion could pose unacceptable human health risks such as raising the lifetime risks of cancer or chronic disease tillman and weaver 2007 and inducing adverse birth outcomes forand et al 2012 recent studies suggest that there are over 100 000 contaminated sites in the u s with the potential for vapor intrusion to occur collier et al 2011 suitable mathematical models can provide an acceptable line of evidence supporting risk management decisions concerning vapor intrusion usepa 2015 studies concerning modeling gas flow in the unsaturated zone you et al 2011a 2011b provide a good basis for modeling vapor intrusion early vapor intrusion models were built based on pesticide transport and radon intrusion models yao et al 2013a johnson and ettinger 1991 presented the first major modeling effort of vapor intrusion and developed the johnson and ettinger j e model in 1991 in the j e model the diffusion mechanism in soil was assumed to dominate the volatile organic compound voc transport in the vadose zone and the effective diffusion coefficient was estimated by the millinton quirk equation millington and quirk 1960 jury et al 1983 the advection caused by the indoor outdoor air pressure difference affected only a small area beneath the building foundation yao et al 2013a and the entry air flow rate was estimated by the nazaroff equation nazaroff 1988 which was first presented in the radon intrusion model currently the j e model is widely employed to predict the vapor intrusion exposure risks at hazardous waste sites as a screening tool since the j e model a number of analytical and numerical models have been proposed based on the former model by taking into account biogeochemical processes to investigate vapor intrusion these developed mathematical models are commonly used to investigate the impact factors of vapor intrusion including source concentration abreu et al 2009 vertical abreu et al 2009 picone et al 2012 and horizontal distances lowell and eklund 2004 yu et al 2009 water content tillman and weaver 2007 shen et al 2012 2013a b

conducted the numerical simulations with contaminant sources below or above the water table the results indicated that the subslab voc concentration when the source located below the water table is lower than that when source located above the water table shen et al 2012 investigated the effects of rainfall on the vapor intrusion they found that a clean water lens accumulated above the napl source after the rainfall event and led to a capping effect which can reduce diffusion rates of voc from the source yao et al 2017b 2018 2019 investigated the effects of soil texture on the vapor intrusion they found that the texture of the soil in the top of the unsaturated zone has the significant impacts on the indoor voc concentration while the texture of the soil in the bottom of the unsaturated zone has negligible impacts the capillary fringe offered a main resistance to the voc transport a clean water lens is commonly regarded as an extra diffusion barrier to voc transport in the subsurface environment shen et al 2012 mchugh et al 2017 a water table rise induced by a precipitation event would establish a clean water lens atop a nonaqueous phase liquid napl source illangasekare et al 2014 shen et al 2012 that exists in the aquifer a significant concentration gradient in the saturated zone atop the napl source was observed at field sites guo 2015 in laboratory experiments illangasekare et al 2014 yao et al 2013b and in mathematical models picone et al 2012 shen et al 2012 yao et al 2013b because of the small diffusion coefficients of vocs in saturated soil approximately 10 6 cm2 s a portion of the napl in the aquifer would be trapped with air due to water table wt fluctuations in the smear zone johnson 1993 hack et al 2015 vocs from trapped napl and air will form bubbles below the wt see fig 1 mass transfers from trapped and dissolved napl to the bubbles cause the air pressure in the bubbles to increase the bubbles begin to expand when the inner gas pressure overcomes the sum of the water and capillary entry pressures the continued expansion of bubbles results in fragmentation and mobilization of the bubbles when the buoyancy force exceeds the sum of the capillary and viscous forces as observed in laboratory experiments roy and smith 2007 mumford et al 2009a b 2010 bubbles are continually produced from the smear zone induced by this mode the bubbles migrate upward forced by the buoyancy force in the saturated zone until they arrive at the wt which can be regarded as a special case of particle transport in porous media wan et al 2001 this process may be completed within a very short time since the bubble rise velocity could be up to 25 cm s haberman and morton 1953 roosevelt and corapcioglu 1998 corapcioglu et al 2004 in the aquifer the bubbles will burst immediately and vocs inside will spread into the above vadose zone when the bubbles cross the wt the latter results in a much higher vapor concentration above the wt relative to the dissolved voc diffusion concentration in the saturated zone soucy and mumford 2017 recently studied the potential effects of this bubble facilitated b f voc transport on vapor intrusion by laboratory experiments a roughly two orders of magnitude higher mass flux was observed in their experiments relative to that of diffusion limited d l voc transport in addition voc transport is much quicker under b f conditions relative to d l voc transport the vapor attenuation factors afs and screening levels of vocs are important parameters in the risk assessment of vapor intrusion the recommended values of these parameters in the risk assessment guidance issued by the usepa are commonly calculated using the d l voc transport model usepa 2015 on the findings of soucy and mumford 2017 however the recommended afs and screening levels calculated by the d l model may be inappropriate since the model neglects the b f mechanism this approach may result in underestimations of the exposure concentration and time and cause health risk threats to the occupants in a building to the best of our knowledge b f voc transport has not been considered in current mathematical models in this study we developed an analytical solution of voc transport in the unsaturated saturated zone by considering bubble migration in the saturated zone the analytical solution was tested using a finite difference numerical solution sensitivity analysis of the parameters was implemented the effects of bubble migration on the af and vapor intrusion pathway completion time t c were investigated the analytical solution was applied to the laboratory experiments of soucy and mumford 2017 2 methods 2 1 mathematical model fig 1 illustrates the b f voc transport in the unsaturated saturated zone the napl source with trapped air is located under the wt at a constant distance z l 1 after expansion fragmentation and migration the air bubbles fill with vocs the bubbles will be transported into the clean saturated zone l 1 z 0 induced by the buoyancy force the bubble transport behaviors are analogous to particle advection dispersions in the saturated zone the bubbles will burst immediately and vocs inside will spread into the above vadose zone when the bubbles cross the wt z 0 vocs will migrate upward in the unsaturated zone by diffusion after reaching the subslab zone z l 2 vocs then leak into the building through cracks in the foundation due to the advection mechanism induced by the indoor outdoor pressure difference the bubble transport in the saturated zone can be treated as a special case of colloid transport in porous media wan et al 2001 therefore the governing equations of the bubble transport in the saturated zone can be written as follows 1a θ b t u b θ b z d b 2 θ b z 2 l 1 z 0 1b θ b z 0 0 1c θ b l 1 t θ b 0 1d θ b z z 0 0 where θ b is the volume fraction of bubbles to porous media l 3 l 3 u b is the bubble advection velocity l t and d b is the bubble dispersion coefficient l 2 t bubble migration is controlled by the interplay of buoyancy viscous and capillary forces and not affected by the above unsaturated zone hence the nonflux boundary condition eq 1d was used on the wt in this study we assume that the interphase mass transfer between the dissolved vocs in the smear zone and the voc vapor in the bubbles attains the equilibrium state therefore the voc concentration in each bubble equals a constant value c b m l 3 that is determined by the dissolved voc concentration c 0 m l 3 in the smear zone the relationship between c b and c 0 satisfies c b h c 0 where h is henry s constant the gas phase concentrations are influenced by the concentrations of other dissolved gases when the main source of the gas in bubbles is dissolved gas in water cirpka and kitanidis 2001 geistlinger et al 2005 however voc in bubbles mainly comes from napl ganglia rather than dissolved voc in the smear zone the concentration of dissolved voc is determined by the napl ganglia as well the impacts of other dissolved gases in the aqueous and gas phases should be limited because the mass transfers of aqueous gas phase are not important relative to the mass transfers of napl gas and napl water in addition according to the observations of gas expansion and mobilization experiments mumford et al 2009a b 2010 the speed of gas expansion or bubble formation is slow therefore it is reasonable to assume that the aqueous and gas phase voc concentrations are in equilibrium during the gas expansion the average voc concentration c b in an arbitrary cross section of the saturated zone above the smear zone is represented by c b θ b c b mass transfer of voc between bubbles and water during the bubble upward migration is neglected with the assumption that the bubble mobilization is much faster than gas dissolution mumford et al 2010 in addition the aqueous diffusion of voc in the saturated zone is neglected and only voc in bubbles is considered in the b f model this is because the diffusive mass flux is very small relative to the voc transport by bubble migration according to the experimental results soucy and mumford 2017 in the unsaturated zone diffusion is usually the main mechanism determining the voc transport the advection caused by the indoor outdoor air pressure difference only affects a small area beneath the building foundation yao et al 2013a there are three common building foundation types basement crawl space and slab on grade this work only concerns slab on grade situations the voc concentration and mass flux across the cracks are assumed to equal those in the subslab soil this assumption is employed in the definition of the upper boundary condition z l 2 hence the governing equation of the voc transport in the unsaturated zone can be written as the following diffusion equation 2a c g t d e 2 c g z 2 0 z l 2 2b c g z 0 0 2c c g 0 t θ b 0 t θ g c b 2d a b d e c g z q c k c g z l 2 0 where c g is the soil gas concentration m l 3 d e is the effective porous medium diffusion coefficient of vocs in the unsaturated zone l 2 t θ g is the air filled porosity l 3 l 3 a b is the cross sectional area of the building foundation l 2 and q c k is the soil gas volumetric entry flow rate l 3 t it should be noted that mass continuity is assumed at the wt and described by eq 2c the effective diffusion coefficient can be estimated by the millinton quirk equation millington and quirk 1960 jury et al 1983 as follows 3 d e d g θ g 10 3 θ t 2 d w θ w 10 3 h θ t 2 where d g is the diffusion coefficient of vocs in air l 2 t d w is the diffusion coefficient of vocs in water l 2 t θ w is the water filled porosity l 3 l 3 and θ t is the total porosity l 3 l 3 the air flow rate into cracks can be estimated by the nazaroff equation nazaroff 1988 as follows 4 q c k 2 π k δ p l c k μ g l n 2 d f w c k where q c k is the soil gas entry flow rate l 3 t k is the soil permeability l 2 δ p is the soil indoor air pressure difference m l t 2 l c k is the length of a perimeter crack l μ g is the viscosity of the soil gas m l t d f is the depth of the foundation l and w c k is the width of the crack l for simplification of the equations we represent the bubble concentration with the average voc concentration c b the voc concentration in the saturated zone is c b hereinafter for consistency we also define the following variables c g θ g c g and c 0 θ t c 0 therefore eqs 1 and 2 can be rearranged as follows below for the saturated zone 5a c b t u b c b z d b 2 c b z 2 l 1 z 0 5b c b z 0 0 5c c b l 1 t c b 0 5d c b z z 0 0 where c b 0 θ b 0 c b s b 0 h c 0 and s b 0 θ b 0 θ t is the bubble saturation that is the fraction of the bubble volume to the porosity to avoid confusion c b 0 is referred to as the gas phase boundary concentration and c 0 is referred to as the aqueous phase boundary concentration hereinafter we only consider the voc transport with the bubble migration in equation 5a therefore the voc concentration in the bottom boundary is assigned as c b 0 rather than c 0 for the unsaturated zone 6a c g t d e 2 c g z 2 0 z l 2 6b c g z 0 0 6c c g 0 t c b 0 t 6d d e c

domain solutions of eqs 5a and 6a subject to initial conditions 5b and 6b and boundary conditions 5c 5d 6c and 6d are given as follows 7a c 1 d z d s a exp α β z d b exp α β z d 7b c 2 d z s m exp γ z d n exp γ z d where the subscript d denotes the dimensionless terms hereinafter the definitions of all dimensionless variables are included in the supporting information s1 s is the laplace transform parameter with respect to the dimensionless time a b m n α β and γ are z d independent variables and their definitions can be found in the supporting information s1 the overbar denotes a variable in the laplace domain hereinafter the details of the derivation of the laplace domain solutions 7a and 7b are presented in s1 it is difficult to obtain closed form solutions by analytically inverting the laplace transforms of these solutions the numerical inverse laplace method is commonly used such as the zakian method zakian 1969 stehfest method stehfest et al 1970 talbot algorithm talbot 1979 fourier series method dubner and abate 1968 crump technique crump 1976 and the de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 a suitable performance of the de hoog algorithm was found for the unsaturated and saturated flow problems in the literature liang et al 2017 2018 therefore the de hoog algorithm was employed to invert the laplace solutions into time domain solutions in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison with the numerical solution to test the validity of the fundamental solution 7 it was compared with numerical solutions of eqs 5 and 6 that were solved by the finite difference method the details are shown in the supporting information s3 a dimensionless parameter set was chosen for the test as follows p 10 d d 0 1 q d 1 a n d l d 0 5 where p is the dimensionless bubble advection velocity and is defined as p u b l 2 d e d d is the dimensionless dispersion coefficient and is defined as d d d b d e q d is the dimensionless soil gas entry flux and is defined as q d q l 2 d e and l d is the dimensionless saturated zone thickness and is defined as l d l 1 l 2 this case with the parameter set was also employed as the reference scenario for the sensitivity analysis in the next section the studied space and time ranges are 0 5 z d 1 and 10 3 t d 10 the number of grid nodes is 601 and the space step is 0 0025 the number of time steps is 1000000 and the time step is 10 5 fig 2 displays the comparison of the analytical and numerical solutions the analytical results show a suitable qualitative agreement with the numerical results the above comparison indicates that the solutions of this study appear to be sufficiently accurate and robust to predict the voc transport in the unsaturated saturated zone fig 2a presents the temporal evolution of the voc concentrations at the middle positions of the saturated z d 0 25 and unsaturated zones z d 0 5 as mentioned previously the rising of bubbles is driven by the buoyancy force and is independent of the vapor transport in the above saturated zone therefore the gas phase voc concentration in the entire saturated zone will increase up to the source concentration in contrast vocs are transported by diffusion in the unsaturated zone hence the voc concentration cannot reach the source concentration in addition the gas phase voc concentration in the saturated zone reaches a maximum value within a very short time relative to that in the unsaturated zone this result is because the bubble migration is faster than the voc diffusion in the unsaturated zone the contaminant concentration profiles at different moments are shown in fig 2b at t d 0 02 bubbles have not arrived at the wt and therefore no vocs are observed in the unsaturated zone the gas phase voc concentration in the whole saturated zone gradually increases up to the source concentration with time the voc concentration in the unsaturated zone also increases with time the voc transport will attain a steady state at t d 2 at this point the voc concentration in the unsaturated zone becomes linear with the distance from the wt 3 2 sensitivity analysis of the model parameters to investigate the impacts of the voc transport parameters and the saturated zone thickness a sensitivity analysis of the dimensionless parameters p d d q d and l d is conducted in this section a sensitivity analysis is also recommended by the usepa before using a mathematical model to investigate vapor intrusion usepa 2015 fig 3 displays the effects of p d d q d and l d on the voc breakthrough curves and concentration profiles where the other parameter values are constant and the same as in fig 2 with increasing p vocs break through at the monitoring points faster in both the saturated and unsaturated zone at early time fig 3a the voc concentrations for different p values finally reach constant values 1 0 for the saturated zone and 0 75 for the unsaturated zone this result means that the voc concentration is independent of the p when the voc transport reaches its steady state this phenomenon is also observed in the concentration profiles fig 3b with the d d increasing we can find that vocs arrive at the two monitoring points earlier however it takes longer to reach the maximum concentration fig 3c similar to the p the d d does not change the maximum concentrations at the two monitoring points 1 0 for the saturated zone and 0 75 for the unsaturated zone and steady state vertical profiles fig 3c and d the effect is different from the impacts of p and d d while the q d does not affect the voc concentration of the saturated zone fig 3e and f the reason is that the variation in q d has no impact on bubble migration in the saturated zone however the q d affects the voc concentrations in the unsaturated zone at later times and the plateau concentration increases with decreasing q d fig 3e and f in fig 3g we can find that vocs can be detected earlier at the two monitoring points for a smaller l d and it takes less time to reach the maximum concentration the maximum concentration did not vary with the l d 1 0 for the saturated zone and 0 75 for the unsaturated zone in general the p and d d determine the transport capacity and the l d is the transport distance in the saturated zone therefore the parameters have impacts on the voc travel time according to the mass flux continuity supporting information s5 the relative concentration in the unsaturated zone at the steady state can be written as follows 8 c 2 d z d 1 1 z d q d 1 q d z d 0 where c 2 d is the relative concentration in the unsaturated zone eq 8 indicates that c 2 d is dependent on q d and z d and independent of p d d and l d at the steady state that is observed in fig 2 as well 3 3 application to the laboratory experiments soucy and mumford 2017 conducted a series of column experiments to study the potential effects of b f voc transport on vapor intrusion the column was composed of four sections including a smear zone z 10 cm a saturated zone 10 cm z 0 an unsaturated zone 0 z 10 cm and a section without a porous medium that acts as a pathway for air flow across the unsaturated zone the thicknesses of both the saturated and unsaturated zones equal 10 cm l 1 l 2 10 c m a column that contained air napl and water in the smear zone was employed in the b f voc transport experiments in addition for comparison the d l voc transport experiments were conducted in a column that contained only napl and water in the smear zone the air flows across the unsaturated zone were equal to 60 and 11 ml min for the b f and d l voc transport experiments respectively a horizontal water flow was applied in the source zone to simulate the groundwater flow in the b f experiment while there was no horizontal water flow in the d l experiment the dissolved voc concentration in the source zone in the b f experiment would be expected to be much lower than that in the d l experiment due to the dilution effect of waterflow pentane was used as voc in the experiments and its physical chemical properties are presented in table s1 of the supporting information s4 the observed mass fluxes of this experiment are presented in the supporting information s4 the details of the experiment can be found in the paper of soucy and mumford 2017 and soucy s master dissertation 2016 the analytical model proposed in this work was applied to the experiments fig 4 shows the breakthrough curves at the column outlet and the vertical voc concentration profiles in the column predicted by the analytical solutions as well as the comparison of the experiment data and analytical solutions of the mass fluxes at the column outlet to compare with the b f voc transport the analytical solution of the d l voc transport was derived by the laplace method which is presented in appendix it should be noted that for the d l model the voc only transported in water in the saturated zone therefore the aqueous phase boundary concentration c 0 is used as the boundary condition that is different from the b f model the boundary concentrations of the b f and d l voc transport experiments are estimated by fitting the observed breakthrough curves with the analytical solutions the estimated gas phase boundary concentration c b 0 for the b f experiment is 1 9 mg l the estimated aqueous phase boundary concentration c 0 for the d l experiment is 11 6 mg l that approaches the solubility limit of voc 12 9 mg l fig 4a indicates that the voc migrates rapidly in the column under the b f condition the effluent concentration reaches its maximum value 0 47 mg l within 0 1 day in contrast the voc transport under the d l condition is considerably slower relative to the b f voc transport the effluent concentration reaches its maximum value 0 025 mg l within 15 days the much higher effluent concentration was obtained in the b f model with a boundary concentration of 1 9 mg l the d l model cannot produce such a high effluent concentration unless the aqueous phase boundary concentration exceeds the solubility limit of voc that is not reasonable in addition the much less voc breakthrough time of the b f model displayed in fig 4a indicates that the transport time scale of the bubble migration is considerably smaller than that of voc diffusion in water this phenomenon was also observed in the gas expansion and mobilization experiment in soucy and mumford 2017 these results suggested that the analytical model is suitable to interpret the observed physical phenomena the significantly shorter transport time of the b f voc transport is ascribed to the relatively high u b of 0 0022 cm s that is estimated according to the description of the bubble transport soucy and mumford 2017 the transport time of the bubble migration can be estimated by t u b l 1 u b equal to 0 053 day in contrast the diffusion of the dissolved pentane in the saturated zone is very slow with a diffusion coefficient of 8 07 10 6 cm2 s in water the transport time of the dissolved voc diffusion can be estimated by t d w l 1 2 d w equal to 11 97 days where d w represents the effective diffusion coefficient in saturated porous media fig 4b shows the concentration profiles in the columns of the b f and d l voc transport experiments the b f voc transport has a much higher effluent concentration owing to the absence of a decrease in concentration in the saturated zone as for the d l voc transport the concentration drops dramatically in the saturated zone since the diffusion coefficient in water is very small similar concentration profiles were found in the capillary fringes by previous studies yao et al 2019 atteia and hohener 2010 shen et al 2012 2013a in contrast the decrease in concentration in the unsaturated zone is nearly negligible for the d l voc transport in general a high concentration at the outlet of the column can be observed within a very short time for the b f voc transport experiment in contrast to the experiment under d l conditions the results of the column experiments demonstrate the importance of bubble migration on the voc transport in the subsurface and the b f voc transport may increase the vapor intrusion risks at sites 3 4 vapor intrusion pathway completion time and attenuation factor the usepa states that cleanup actions should be undertaken when the vapor exposure pathway is complete and the human health risks are above certain risk levels usepa 2015 the usepa proposed five conditions to identify whether the vapor intrusion pathway can be referred to as complete for a building one of the conditions is expressed as one or more vapor forming chemicals comprising the subsurface vapor source s is or are present in the indoor environment hence two parameters that are independent from the source concentration the characteristic time t c and the a f are employed to characterize the vapor intrusion scenarios in this work picone et al 2012 the characteristic time gives an indication of the time of vapor intrusion completion and the urgency of remedial actions and t c is calculated as the time at which the subslab soil gas concentration equals half of the maximum concentration c t c 0 5 c s s where c s s is the contaminant subslab concentration at the steady state the af is defined as the ratio of the subslab voc concentration to the source concentration a f c s s c 0 the monitored a f in a site investigation is a very important factor in the multiple lines of evidence mle for vapor intrusion assessment in practice usepa 2015 the above results indicate that bubble migration can considerably enhance the voc transport in the subsurface to further investigate the impacts of bubble migration on vapor intrusion the a f and t c are calculated using the b f and d l voc transport models respectively the value ranges of the parameters employed in the simulations are displayed in table 1 which are determined according to the previous literature roosevelt and corapcioglu 1998 measured the u b in a saturated column filled with 4 mm glass beads the researchers measurements showed that u b increased from 5 2 to 25 cm s with the bubble size which is similar to the experimental findings of bubbles rising in water haberman and morton 1953 very slow bubble migrations were observed in the spontaneous gas expansion experiments roy and smith 2007 mumford et al 2009a 2010 haberman and morton 1953 the lowest u b is approximately 2 10 5 cm s estimated by experimental images at different times mumford et al 2010 in the experiments of roosevelt and corapcioglu 1998 the upper bound of bubble velocity is 25 cm s owing to the bubbles produced by the air injection in gravel sized media in this study the bubbles in the napl source zone are produced by gas expansion and mobilization and the velocity cannot attain such a large value therefore the upper bound of bubble velocity is set as 10 cm s it should be noted that the bound of the bubble velocity has little impacts on estimations of vapor intrusion pathway completion time for the b f model this is because the bubble migration time in the saturated zone is very small relative to the voc migration time in the unsaturated zone when the bubble velocity approaches the upper bound hence u b varying from 2 10 5 to 10 cm s is adopted by this study the d b can be calculated by the equation d b α b u b where α b is the bubble dispersivity l the value of α b is set to 0 1 1 cm in this study according to the literature concerning particle transport in saturated porous media chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 bradford et al 2002 ahfir et al 2016 hence the d b varies from 2 10 6 to 10 cm2 s for the d e because this study focuses on the comparison of two modes of voc transport in the saturated zone the influence of the soil moisture is not considered here hence the value of d e is set to 0 01 0 1 cm2 s according to the d g values of common vocs d w is the diffusion coefficient of vocs in saturated porous media and is defined as d w d w θ t 1 3 it should be noted that a six orders of magnitude variation in the bubble rise velocity in the saturated zone was observed in the previous literature the voc travel time in the aquifer under b f conditions is mainly dependent on the u b the soil texture has a significant impact on the bubble velocity for gas flow in saturated porous media the flow rate is determined by the particle size distribution psd gas flow has two patterns in porous media continuous channel flow and discontinuous cluster or bubble flow a critical flow rate exists as q c r i t π δ ρ g r c 4 8 μ g geistlinger et al 2006 where q c r i t is the critical gas flow rate l 3 t δ ρ is the density difference between air and water m l 3 g is the gravity acceleration constant l t 2 r c is the gas channel radius l and μ g is the gas dynamic viscosity stable gas channels form as the flow rate is superior to the critical rate otherwise gas migrates in the form of clusters or bubbles the r c is highly dependent on the particle size hence the soil texture is an important factor for the gas flow pattern on the other hand for bubble flow the height of a bubble can be estimated by h b b o 1 d p stöhr and khalili 2006 where b o is the bond number and d p is the particle diameter l this equation means that the soil psd determines the bubble size distribution the bubble rise velocity in a porous medium was observed to be a function of the bubble size in the literature roosevelt and corapcioglu 1998 haberman and morton 1953 tsuchiya et al 1997 this relationship was further confirmed by corapcioglu et al 2004 using an analytical solution as a consequence the soil psd determines the bubble size distribution and therefore the velocity distributions u b and d b simulations with different u b d b d w and l 1 values were conducted to compare the t c values predicted by the two models we fixed l 2 2 m d e 0 02 c m 2 s and q 0 005 c m s in these simulations since the b f and d l voc transports have similar vapor migration processes in the unsaturated zone the t c of the simulations with the b f model t c b varies from 3 39 to 61 66 days while the t c of the simulations with the d l model t c d varies from 29 51 to 16218 1 days this result indicates that the variation range of t c d is much wider than that of t c b and t c d is much larger than t c b generally therefore it is inappropriate to use the d l model to predict whether the vapor intrusion pathway is complete to investigate the effects of the transport parameters on the difference of the t c values predicted by the two models a dimensionless variable φ 8 d w u b l 1 is introduced here where φ represents the ratio of the travel time of bubble advection t u b l 1 u b to that of voc diffusion in the saturated zone t d w l 1 2 8 d w it should be noted that advection dominates the bubble migration in the saturated zone due to p e u b l 1 d b 10 therefore bubble dispersion is not considered when calculating the travel time fig 5 a shows that t c b t c d increases with φ this finding implies that the difference between t c b and t c d increases with decreasing d w and increasing u b and l 1 usually the d w values of vocs vary within one order of magnitude gharagheizi 2012 therefore the voc travel time in the saturated zone under d l conditions is mainly determined by the thickness of the aquifer above the smear zone l 1 as mentioned above a f is defined as the ratio of the voc subslab concentration to the source concentration in a vapor intrusion site the dissolved voc concentration c 0 in the groundwater can be measured directly which can be regarded as the source concentration usepa 2015 therefore we used c 0 as the source concentration when calculating the af of the b f and d l models the af values of the b f and d l voc transports can be calculated according to the continuity of the mass flux s6 as follows 9 a f b s b 0 h d e l 2 q d e and 10 a f d h 1 q d w l 1 h q d e l 2 where d w is the diffusion coefficient in a saturated porous medium which is defined as millington and quirk 1960 jury et al 1983 d w d w θ t 1 3 usually q d w l 1 h q d e l 2 1 because the d w is very small therefore the a f d can be approximated by a f d d w q l 1 and the impacts of h and d e on the a f d are neglected the ratio of a f b to a f d can be written as follows based on eqs 9 and 10 11 a f b a f d s b 0 d w d e d e h l 1 q d w l 2 q d w l 2 q d e a f b varies from 8 45 10 4 to 9 71 10 2 while a f d varies from 1 97 10 6 to 1 6 10 2 a f b is much larger than a f d generally to investigate the effects of the transport parameters on the difference of the a f values predicted by the two models a dimensionless variable ω s b 0 h d e d w l 1 l 2 is introduced here fig 5b shows that the a f b a f d ratio rises linearly with the increase in ω the difference between a f b and a f d becomes larger with increasing s b 0 h d e and l 1 and decreasing d w and l 2 the a f b will be four orders of magnitude larger than the a f d when ω reaches its maximum value this result means that the neglection of bubble migration would probably result in underestimation of the vapor intrusion concentration the ratio of d e d w is very high and varies from 2 5 103 to 2 5 105 this finding reflects that the voc transport in the unsaturated zone is much faster than that in the saturated zone by diffusion therefore the clean water lens atop the contaminant source is considered to act as a diffusive barrier shen et al 2012 mchugh et al 2017 however this study indicates that the damping effects of the water lens will become much weaker in the presence of bubble migration in addition a f b a f d increases with the l 1 which means that a deep contaminant source under the wt may induce a large deviation between the predicted concentration by the d l model and the actual concentration 3 5 implications the aboveesults indicate that the d l voc transport model will underestimate the af and overestimate the t c due to neglecting bubble migration this kind of inaccurate estimation of the two parameters could mislead the site manager to make a wrong decision in practice the usepa vapor intrusion guidance states that at properties where the subsurface concentrations of vocs fall below the vapor intrusion screening levels visls no further action or study is warranted usepa 2015 however the use of recommended a f s and visls calculated by the d l model are inappropriate for risk assessment in the presence of bubble migration in the saturated zone on the other hand significant overestimation of the t c would induce incorrect predictions of the pathway completion time and urgency of the response action as a consequence the project team may set up an inappropriate schedule of response actions e g remediation of the source this situation would increase the exposure times to the contaminant vapor of the building occupants e g residents and workers according to the guidance for soil screening of the usepa in 2001 usepa 2002 2004 the cancer risk is estimated as the following relationship 12 c r u r f e f e d c i n d o o r a t where cr is the increased lifetime cancer risk urf is the inhalation unit risk factor m l 3 ef is the exposure frequency t t ed is the exposure duration t c i n d o o r is the indoor air concentration m l3 and at is the averaging time t neglecting bubble migration would induce significant underestimations of c i n d o o r and extra ed fig 5 therefore predictions using the d l model would increase the threats to the health of occupants in a building however the b f voc transport model developed in this study supplies an efficient mathematical tool to investigate the potential effects of bubble migration on vapor intrusion 3 6 limitations of the analytical model there are several limitations that should be addressed for better application of this study first we assumed the effective diffusion coefficient of the analytical models was a constant which is dependent on the soil moisture the soil moisture varies with space and time in practice resulting in that the effective diffusion coefficient is varying in space and time as well shen et al 2013a investigated the effects of the variation of soil moisture on the concentration profile of voc in the soil the results indicated that the variation in soil moisture has nonnegligible impacts on the concentration profile especially for sand however it is a significant challenge to solve the diffusion equation with a spatiotemporally dependent diffusion coefficient analytically which will be investigated in future second in this study the gas phase boundary concentration c b 0 is obtained by fitting experimental data rather than by the measurements because it is difficult to directly measure the saturation of the bubble formed by the gas expansion s b 0 mumford et al 2010 conducted a numerical simulation of the gas expansion and mobilization above a napl pool using macroscopic invasion percolation techniques it is analogous to the bubble formation in the source zone of this study the work of mumford et al inspires us to develop a practical method to calculate s b 0 in future third the mass transfer of voc between bubbles and water during the bubble migration is neglected in this study based on an assumption that the voc dissolution is much slower than the bubble mobilization mumford et al 2010 however holocher et al 2003 observed that a trapped bubble with a radius of 0 35 mm would be completely dissolved in 3 7 days indicating that the mass transfer of voc between bubbles and water is nonnegligible when the bubbles migration is slow therefore to more accurately describe the voc transport in the saturated zone the mass transfer of voc between bubbles and water needs to be considered in a case of low bubble velocity in future finally a rapid rise of bubbles would result in the gas advection in the vicinity of the water table to consider this advective mechanism the diffusion model adopted by this study to describe the voc transport in the unsaturated zone should be replaced with an advection diffusion model however this advection diffusion model is difficult to solve analytically because the advection velocity arising from the high gas pressure in the water table is varied with time and space therefore this process has not been considered in our analytical model such a limitation exists in most studies with analytical approach 4 conclusions in this study an analytical model of the bubble facilitated b f vapor intrusion was developed to investigate the effects of upward bubble migration in the saturated zone on the vapor intrusion in contrast to the diffusion limited d l model the b f model takes into account the bubble migration in the aquifer first the analytical solution was tested by a numerical solution the sensitivity analysis of the model parameters was carried out to understand the voc transport under b f conditions then the b f model was applied to a laboratory experiment finally the effects of the bubble migration on attenuation factor af and characteristic time t c were investigated by comparing the results predicted by the b f model and the d l model in a variety of scenarios the conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 according to the sensitivity analyses of the model parameters the bubble advection velocity dispersion coefficient and the thickness of the saturated zone have impacts on the voc travel time under b f conditions however the final concentration at the steady state only depends on the soil gas entry flux into the building 2 the b f model managed to reproduce the results of the two order of magnitude higher mass flux at the column outlet relative to that of the d l voc transport the boundary concentrations in the b f and d l models are estimated by fitting the measured mass flux at the outlet with the analytical models 3 for the b f voc transport no concentration decrease occurred in the saturated zone at the steady state by contrast a four order of magnitude decrease of concentration in the aquifer was observed under d l conditions therefore the bubble upward migration can considerably enhance the voc transport in the subsurface environment 4 the t c predicted by the b f model t c b varies from 3 39 to 61 66 days while the t c predicted by the d l model t c d varies from 29 51 to 16218 1 days the a f predicted by the b f model a f b varies from 8 45 10 4 to 9 71 10 2 while the a f predicted by the d l model a f d varies from 1 97 10 6 to 1 6 10 2 therefore the d l model would significantly overestimate t c and underestimate af in the presence of the bubble migration in the saturated zone consequently the site manager in charge of a vapor intrusion site may make an inappropriate decision since the current vapor intrusion screen levels in the guides are calculated under d

18514,deionization devices that use intercalation reactions to reversibly store and release cations from solution show promise for energy efficient desalination of alternative water resources intercalation materials often display low electronic conductivity that results in increased energy consumption during desalination accordingly we performed experiments to quantify the impact of the size and mass fraction of conductive additives and insulative active particles on the effective electronic conductivity ionic conductivity and hydraulic permeability of porous electrodes we find that ketjen black conductive additives with nodules 50 nm in diameter produce superior electronic conductivity at lower mass fractions than the larger carbon blacks commonly used in capacitive deionization hydraulic permeability and effective ionic conductivity depend weakly on carbon black content and size though smaller active particles decrease hydraulic permeability based on these results we analyzed the energy consumption and salt removal rate of different electrode formulations by constructing an electrochemical ashby plot predicting the variation of desalination performance with electrode transport properties optimized electrodes containing insulative prussian blue analogue pba particles were then fabricated and used in an experimental cation intercalation desalination cid cell with symmetric electrodes for 100 mm nacl influent energy consumption varied from 7 to 33 kj mol when current density increased from 1 to 8 ma cm2 approaching ten fold increased salt removal rate at similar energy consumption levels to past cid demonstrations complementary numerical and analytical modeling indicates that further improvements in energy consumption and salt removal rate are

that further improvements can be achieved but mechanistic understanding of rate and capacity limiting processes shrivastava and smith 2018 is needed to make cid competitive with reverse osmosis qin et al 2019 in this work we investigate the influence of conductive additives on the electronic conductivity ionic conductivity and hydraulic permeability of porous electrodes incorporating insulative particles after using theory to guide the selection of a particular electrode formulation on the basis of desalination energy consumption and rate we demonstrate cid cycling performance using optimized electrodes containing nickel hexacyanoferrate pba in a flow through cid cell while intercalation materials possess high capacity in comparison with the activated carbons typically used in conventional capacitive deionization cdi suss et al 2015 suss and presser 2018 intercalation materials often suffer from low electronic conductivity causing high energy consumption and slow charge

carbon blacks of various average radii to assess the tradeoffs in their transport properties with loading including effective electronic conductivity σ e f f recent modeling of coupled transport phenomena in fdi cells has shown that the flow of solution through electrodes rather than the flow of solution past electrodes can enhance desalination performance liu and smith 2018 the development of flow through electrode fte cdi cells with fluid flow and current density aligned in the same direction has also shown increased charging rates through the use of hierarchical suss et al 2012 and laser perforated guyes et al 2017 electrodes large volumes of electrolyte must permeate porous electrodes in fte configurations to facilitate operation at high rate accordingly pumping power and pressure which are functions of hydraulic permeability k h and cell design cannot be ignored when analyzing energy consumption tian et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 in the related field of redox flow batteries wherein electrolytes are often flowed through porous electrodes few studies have measured k h as a function of electrode composition despite its influence on pressure drop when using different flow channel configurations such as interdigitated parallel spiral and serpentine al yasiri and park 2018 2017 dennison et al 2015 for the electrodes that we fabricate in this work we measure k h and quantify its influence on energy consumption in desalination the finite ionic conductivity of porous electrodes in fdi cells leads to ohmic polarization and consequently irreversible energy consumption the macmullin number m c the ratio between the bulk ionic conductivity of the electrolyte κ 0 and its effective value κ e f f is determined by the size distribution and topology of electrode pores previous research has found macmullin number to depend on electrode porosity ε and particle shape as these factors determine the number and length of paths available for ions to travel through the electrode habte and jiang 2018 landesfeind et al 2016 the scaling of m c with ε is generally nonlinear due to the combined effects of the decreased throat size of pores and the increasingly tortuous path along which ions travel when porosity decreases these effects are captured by the bruggeman relation m c 1 ε 1 5 chung et al 2013 thorat et al 2009 which is valid only for certain microstructures with spherical particles electrodes composed of non spherical particles can have macmullin number and porosity related by the function m c 1 ε α where α is the bruggeman exponent landesfeind et al 2016 to circumvent this scaling we recently milled macroscopic pores into microporous cdi electrodes to enhance ionic conduction and reduce charging times reale and smith 2018 and such electrodes showed lower impedance higher adsorption rate and higher adsorption capacity than unmilled electrodes bhat et al 2019 thus in the present work we measure the tradeoffs between m c σ e f f and k h for various electrode processing conditions to maximize salt removal rate in fdi in capacitive deionization using edls performance has been quantified by relating specific energy consumption sec defined as the energy required to remove 1 mole of salt to the average salt adsorption rate asar defined as the average rate of salt removal per unit area of the electrode due to the decreasing ionic conductivity of effluent and the re salination time between adsorption and desorption steps the faster salt is removed in cdi the more energy is required hawks et al 2018 wang and lin 2018 thus cdi research has been motivated to increase asar without increasing sec another method of quantifying performance is the kim yoon or cdi ragone plot which compares deionization capacity to salt removal rate kim and yoon 2014 in contrast to these approaches wherein tradeoffs in performance metrics are quantified for a discrete set of materials the inverse problem can be posed wherein a space of material properties is defined with corresponding performance contours while such analyses have typically been relegated to mechanical problems using ashby diagrams ashby 2011 electrochemical materials selection maps have been constructed for redox flow batteries to minimize power losses due to ohmic resistance dmello et al 2016 wei et al 2015 and electrolyte cost dmello et al 2016 here we pose a materials selection problem for flow through fdi electrodes in the three dimensional σ e f f κ e f f k h space to maximize asar for fixed sec a brief outline of this work follows here to study the effects of electrode composition and particle size transport properties were measured for porous electrodes consisting of insulative powders of different particle size and carbon blacks with different specific surface areas alumina was selected as a pseudo active surrogate material for insulative active particles because of its low conductivity and abundance the use of which was ultimately validated by creating porous electrodes containing nihcf pba with an optimized electrode formulation the varying sizes of particles are shown to influence how ions and fluid move through the electrode microstructure we also introduce a framework for the selection of electrode materials based on these properties by modeling the energy losses arising from viscous flow through electrodes and ionic electronic ohmic polarization within electrodes at finite salt removal rate by targeting a high electronic conductivity using ketjen black with certain mass fraction pba electrodes were fabricated and tested in a cid cell 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrode preparation alumina al2o3 particles were used as a pseudo active material in place of insulative intercalation particles with two different diameters 1 μm advalue technology and 40 nm skyspring nanomaterials inc two different types of carbon black were combined with alumina to assess the impact of size and morphology on transport properties c45 mti xtl and ketjen black ec 600jd kb akzo nobel these two carbons show order of magnitude difference in specific surface area and particle radii 960 nm 45 m2 g particles for c45 compared to 34 nm 1270 m2 g for kb the various electrode slurries were prepared by mixing alumina and carbon black cb with alumina cb mass ratios from 95 0 to 87 5 7 5 each with 5 wt pvdf binder in all cases we note that previous cdi studies have used activated carbon electrodes with binder loading levels of approximately 10 wt abbas and pajak 2014 hassanvand et al 2017 lim et al 2009 the mass loading of binder was reduced here to produce a similar volume fraction to previous cdi experiments by accounting for alumina s two fold higher density than carbon 3 95 g cm3 versus 2 g cm3 powder mixtures were dispersed in nmp solvent and mixed in a thinky are 310 planetary mixer for 25 min followed by 5 min of deaeration to remove air bubbles due to electrode slurries containing nanoparticles being more viscous than slurries of microparticles a larger amount of nmp was used during mixing to cast such slurries for 1 μm diameter alumina particles only 1 ml of solvent was needed for each gram of the solid powder mixture while 1 5 ml g was needed to produce a castable slurry for 40 nm particles after thorough mixing slurries were cast using an elcometer film applicator onto either conducting graphite foil ceramaterials or non conducting ptfe ast industries inc substrates experiments measuring electronic and ionic conductivity used ptfe substrates to prevent the substrate from interfering with the measurements because ptfe has a conductivity of 10 14 s m measurements of hydraulic permeability were performed on electrodes supported on graphite foil to stabilize samples and to enable their precise arrangement in the testing apparatus once cast at a desired thickness level the electrode and substrate were immersed in deionized water to remove nmp solvent by a wet phase inversion process lim et al 2009 solidified electrodes were then air dried at room temperature to remove residual nmp electrodes were re immersed in either deionized water or 100 mm aqueous nacl for 12 h prior to testing to enable thorough wetting and to remove air bubbles 2 2 electronic and ionic conductivity electronic conductivity of the electrodes was measured using an inhouse built four point probe with gold coated 0 5 mm diameter pins spaced 2 mm apart to contact electrodes the small thickness of samples 100 μm compared to the probe spacing 2 mm makes the thin film approximation of four point probe theory valid once dried the electrodes were wetted in 100 mm aqueous nacl for 12 h to remove any air bubbles a four point probe method was used to measure effective electronic and ionic conductivity the details of which are described in the electronic supplementary material esm measured current between source probes i t a was fitted to a stretched exponential function with stretching factor β as in a previous study of edl formation and dissipation li et al 2017 1 i t i i e t τ β i e fits showed an average error of 5 at most and 1 in the best cases when compared to experimental data in the context of these experiments the initial i i and final i f currents are most important because ionic and electronic conductivity can be determined directly using their values as charge builds up in the edl on source probe tips ionic current declines until current can only move through the solid matrix the slope of the lower envelope of current versus potential in fig s2b esm is proportional to the sum of effective electronic σ e f f s m and ionic κ e f f s m conductivity while the slope of the upper envelope of current versus potential is proportional to effective ionic conductivity κ e f f kang et al 2017 2 σ f i n a l ln 2 π i e w v σ e f f 3 σ i n i t i a l ln 2 π i i i e w v σ e f f κ e f f here w m is the thickness of a given electrode and v v is the potential difference between the inner leads of the apparatus macmullin number m c was subsequently calculated as 4 m c κ 0 κ e f f where κ 0 is the ionic conductivity of 100 mm aqueous nacl at 298 k 1 067 s m chambers et al 1956 2 3 hydraulic permeability to measure the hydraulic permeability of porous electrodes 1 25 1 25 cm2 samples were cut from electrodes cast onto graphite foil and placed into a 0 5 mm deep channel through which deionized water was driven by a small hydraulic head δ p pa fig s3 esm the samples were wrapped in ptfe tape to seal them and to force solution flow exclusively through the porous electrode hydraulic head was supplied by a reservoir to ensure a consistent water level water flowed through the electrode over a period of 1 h after which the average fluid flow was calculated from the collected water mass to account for the no slip condition at the edges of our porous electrodes as in other work on redox flow batteries ke et al 2015 we solved the darcy brinkman equation analytically for the flow rate v m3 s through a rectangular cross section of thickness w depth d m and flow path length l m due to the 1 25 cm distance d being two orders larger than the electrode thickness lateral edge effects were ignored the effective viscosity term in the darcy brinkman equation has been shown by simulation to increase as porosity decreases martys et al 1994 starov and zhdanov 2001 here we assume that effective viscosity is inversely proportional to porosity μ e f f μ ε pa s in eq 5 as porosity decreases the flow rate approaches zero 5 v δ p k h μ w d l 1 4 k h w 2 ε tanh w 2 ε 4 k h permeability k h m2 was calculated by solving eq 5 numerically with measured flow rate and porosity using matlab porosity ε is dependent on the loading of each solid and it was calculated as ε 1 ρ t o t a l ρ s o l i d where ρ t o t a l g cm3 is the average dry electrode density and ρ s o l i d is the mass averaged density of the electrode constituents carbon black pseudo actives and pvdf 2 4 desalination experiments based on the result of conductivity measurements faradaic electrodes containing nickel hexacyanoferrate pba as an active material were fabricated for desalination experiments these electrodes used nanoscopic ketjen black particles as a conductive additive rather than the large c45 carbon black particles pba particles were prepared using the process developed previously shrivastava and smith 2018 electrodes contained 80 active material 10 ketjen black and 10 pvdf binder by mass and slurries were prepared using 3 ml of nmp per gram of powder mixture these slurries were cast solidified and dried using the same process as the alumina electrodes on a graphite foil substrate the desalination cell fig s4 esm used a pair of machined graphite sheets as current collectors and a flow field 3d printed using a polyjet eden 350 printer clamped together by a pair of laser cut delrin plates the area of both anode and cathode was 2 5 cm2 with approximately 150 μm thickness separated by an anion exchange membrane neosepta amx influent was supplied to the cell from a single large reservoir with 100 mm nacl concentration effluent concentration was measured using a pair of 17 μl flow through conductivity probes edaq flow was driven by a peristaltic pump masterflex l s to supply a flow rate of 0 25 ml min desalination tests were conducted by applying constant currents of 1 2 4 6 and 8 ma cm2 to the electrodes using a vmp 3 potentiostat while simultaneously measuring the effluent conductivity of the two channels values for equivalent conductance were used to calibrate the conductivity sensors for 100 mm influent chambers et al 1956 and the differences in measured conductivity were proportional to differences in concentration the difference in salt concentration between the influent and effluent was used to calculate charge efficiency which is the ratio between the number of charges from salt absorption and the applied current and the average salt absorption rate the energy consumed per mole of removed salt or specific energy consumption was found from the average power measured for that rate of salt removal 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrode transport property measurements measurements of electronic conductivity ionic conductivity and hydraulic permeability were performed on electrodes combining different loading levels of carbon black and alumina powders with 5 wt pvdf content producing cb alumina mass ratios equal to 0 0 95 0 2 5 92 5 5 0 90 0 and 7 5 87 5 electrodes containing greater quantities of carbon black were prone to cracking even when cast at low thicknesses we present results in terms of volume fraction rather than mass fraction to generalize our results to electrodes using active compounds with arbitrary mass density fig 1a shows effective electronic conductivity for the electrode samples tested in addition to the error caused by variations in electrode thickness measurements the possibility of hydrogen evolution in the electrolyte required an additional 10 error in the measurement of conductivity this error estimate is especially conservative at higher conductivities because the current produced by electrolysis would become less significant compared to electronic current as electrode conductivity increases the increasing volume fractions of carbon black in the case of electrodes using micro scale pseudo active and c45 particles show that additives do not significantly improve electronic conductivity until a certain threshold additive loading is reached this effect is attributed to the percolation of conductive additive networks that is required for electrons to access the high conductivity of carbon black at the macro scale in contrast for electrodes comprised primarily of nano scale pseudo active and ketjen black particles a volume fraction of less than 0 5 ketjen black caused an immediate increase in conductivity by an order of magnitude relative to an electrode without carbon black these findings suggest that ketjen black percolates more easily than c45 especially when nano scale pseudo active particles are mixed together with them electrodes with nano scale pseudo actives and ketjen black consistently showed higher conductivity for similar carbon black loading and ketjen black proved superior to c45 at improving conductivity though higher electronic conductivity can be achieved at lower mass or volume fractions by using smaller pseudo active particles at higher loadings electronic conductivity saturates to 1 2 s m furthermore testing electrodes with higher carbon black loading was limited by electrode cracking we also note that the porosities of the nanoparticulate electrodes were generally 10 higher than the electrodes made with microparticles resulting in a wider range of carbon black volume fractions despite identical mass fractions in the power mixture electrode macmullin number which is an inverse measure of effective ionic conductivity normalized by bulk ionic conductivity decreased with increasing volume fraction of carbon black except when compared with the electrodes only containing pseudo active particles fig 1 b thus we observe that adding carbon black to increase electronic conductivity also increases effective ionic conductivity this trend contrasts with previous measurements of tortuosity for li ion battery electrodes with varying levels of conductive additives this difference may be attributed to the fact that the pseudo active particles used in the present work are less than 1 μm in diameter compared to previous works using spheroids and flakes with dimensions exceeding 5 μm forouzan et al 2017 such large anisometric particles are likely to block more paths within pores and to impede ion transport than the smaller isometric ones used here in addition to the electronic and ionic conductivities of electrodes the hydraulic permeabilities of different electrode compositions are of interest for flow through electrodes we observe from fig 1c that electrodes using c45 and ketjen black with micro scale pseudo active particles possess different k h in contrast for electrodes using nano scale pseudo active particles hydraulic permeability shows a much less varied range of values remaining within 5 of each other we attribute the lower permeability in the case of electrodes using nano scale pseudo active particles relative to micron scale particles to the smaller pores produced by smaller particles this effect is also noticeable when comparing electrodes made with ketjen black and c45 when electrode particles pack together larger particles produce larger pores and higher permeability electrodes made using micro scale pseudo active particles showed greater variation in permeability with carbon black content than electrodes made with nano scale particles because pseudo active nanoparticles and carbon black particles were similar in size both being 50 nm the addition of ketjen black to those electrodes affected their average pore diameter to a minimal extent this conclusion is consistent with our data showing smaller permeability for electrodes made with ketjen black particles relative to those made with the larger c45 particles to validate our use of alumina as an insulative pseudo active compound we also measured the transport properties of an electrode containing prussian blue analogue pba nanoparticles carbon black and pvdf the results are directly compared to those for electrodes using pseudo active particles in table 1 when pba particles were combined with ketjen black the electronic conductivity of pba electrodes was fifty fold larger than when combined with c45 while only a three fold increase was observed in the case of the alumina permeability for the pba and alumina electrodes was on the same order of magnitude though the pba electrodes were more resistant to flow the macmullin number of pba ketjen black electrodes was 31 smaller than pba c45 electrodes while hydraulic permeability was 12 lower for pba ketjen black sem images of the two pba electrodes in fig 2 reveal that the electrode with ketjen black appears significantly rougher than with c45 the c45 electrode has larger agglomerates and thus binder is spread over less area and obscures solid particles while ketjen black particles are visible and appear more distributed through the microstructure 3 2 analysis of energy consumption in porous electrodes the electronic conductivity σ e f f ionic conductivity κ e f f and hydraulic permeability k h of porous electrodes will influence how an fdi device using them performs in terms of energy consumption specifically energy losses arise from electronic resistance ionic resistance and pumping power in addition to baseline energy consumption due to the gibbs free energy of separation specific energy consumption sec or the amount of energy needed to remove 1 mole of salt from feedwater is a commonly used metric to quantify these effects in cdi furthermore sec is inherently a function of the average salt adsorption rate asar defined as the average salt absorbed for a unit electrode area over one minute wang and lin 2018 to put the transport properties that we have measured in context for fdi applications we presently construct an ashby diagram to project their impact on asar for a specified sec level each point in this materials selection map is defined by a transport property triplet σ e f f κ e f f k h we use analytical modeling to construct contours of constant sec and asar so as to define guidelines for materials selection for certain σ e f f κ e f f k h we select an operating flow rate in terms of applied current density by using a balance of charges when salt concentration is reduced from a feed stream with concentration c e i n mm by a desired amount δ c e l c e i n c e o u t where the mean effluent concentration is c e o u t and the subscript l denotes a longitudinal concentration difference after assuming a simple series resistance model for electronic and ionic resistances an analytical expression for sec kj mol can be derived in terms of asar μmol cm2 min σ e f f and κ e f f see esm 6 s e c a s a r z f λ 2 w κ e f f w σ e f f μ k h l 2 w 1 δ c e l 2 where z λ μ f w and l are cation valence charge efficiency viscosity faraday s constant electrode thickness and flow path length using this result we construct contours of asar for a given sec with varying κ e f f σ e f f and k h to show the combinations of electrode properties that are necessary to reach a desired asar as shown in fig 3 concave surfaces comprise these contours because increasing one of the three transport properties reduces a portion of energy consumption enough that only the other two contributions remain significant the further out a point is along all three axes the higher an asar that is attainable fig 3 shows that electronic conductivity ionic conductivity and permeability can all be increased to reduce the overall sec of an electrode if a particular asar is required however the energy demands of the three transport properties are each independent of the others and even if one could be increased by orders of magnitude the energy demands would become dominated by the others ionic conductivity is particularly difficult to control which has motivated research aiming to reduce macmullin number for the purpose of making cdi a viable technology nemani et al 2015 reale and smith 2018 bhat et al 2019 permeability has also been the subject of efforts to improve the performance of cdi via the addition of macroscopic pores to reduce flow resistance guyes et al 2017 numerous examples of work with various carbon black additives have attempted to improve electronic conductivity liu et al 2007 nadakatti et al 2011 shetzline and creager 2014 the materials tested show permeability an order of magnitude above what is necessary however the varying macmullin numbers and order of magnitude variations in electronic conductivity limit the possible asar 3 3 desalination experiments after completing experiments varying the carbon black content of the electrodes pba electrodes were fabricated using 10wt ketjen black rather than c45 due to the former carbon black s demonstrated superiority as a conductive additive electrode samples with 2 5 cm2 area were then used in a symmetric cid cell with the flow of electrolyte through electrodes galvanostatic cycling of the electrodes was performed at current densities of 1 8 ma cm2 with a flow rate of 0 25 ml min and 100 mm nacl influent the desalinating electrode intercalated sodium ions from influent while chloride passed through the aem into the counter electrode resulting in the inlet to outlet concentration differences and voltage variations shown in fig 4 a for a current density of 6 ma cm2 the change in concentration is approximately linearly dependent on current density as increasing the current at a certain flow rate ideally removes a proportional amount of salt fig 4b at 1 ma cm2 the pba particles showed a specific capacity of 50 55 mah g for one electrode mass per battery convention and a salt absorption capacity of 54 5 60 mg g for two electrode masses per cdi convention capacity decreased with increasing current though the values at each current density remained stable across the ten cycles performed subsequent tests showed capacity at 1 ma cm2 returned to over 50 mah g and the average over ten cycles was 1 2 greater than the average for the initial ten cycles fig 4c charge efficiency ce was highest at low current densities and the decline of ce caused a drop in the measured concentration difference fig 4d at 8 ma cm2 the performance of the cell declined significantly likely an effect due to poor flow efficiency and short residence times in the cell hawks et al 2018 a certain volume of effluent must flow out of the electrode during each cycling period while also reaching the conductivity meter to be measure salinity however reduced capacity at high current caused a given half cycle to complete too quickly for example at 8 ma cm2 half cycle time was less than 60 s with an electrode volume of approximately 36 μl the volume of fluid in the electrode flowed less than seven times during each half cycle reliable conductivity measurement also becomes more difficult due to the time that the fluid exiting the electrode needs to reach the conductivity sensor being similar to the half cycle time in sec 3 2 our theoretical estimation of power consumption for a given salt removal level assumes an infinite charge capacity and constant effluent salt concentrations however our experimental data here shows that charging time limits reliable measurement and calculation of salt removal to confirm the superiority of ketjen black over c45 shown in tests with alumina electrodes pba electrodes containing 10wt c45 were also prepared and tested in the fdi cell under identical conditions direct property comparisons between the different electrodes are shown in table 1 of sec 3 1 at a current density of 1 ma cm2 their capacity was less than 5 of that measured for the pba ketjen black electrodes with a maximum concentration change of less than 2 mm at current densities of 2 ma cm2 and above pba c45 electrodes did not function reliably and could not produce useable experimental data analysis of net electrical energy input showed relatively low sec for the asar values observed showing substantial improvements in specific energy consumption and current density previous cid cells using multiple intervening ion exchanges membranes reported values of 14 7 kj mol for 50 mm influent and 0 57 ma cm2 kim et al 2017 while the present experiments using optimized electrodes produce lower sec for current densities as high as 4 ma cm2 our initial demonstration of cid using flow behind pba electrodes decreased salt concentration from 20 mm nacl influent by only 0 5 mm at 0 14 ma cm2 while consuming 15 kj mol porada et al 2017 other work using dissimilar pbas in a cid configuration reported an sec of 5 0 kj mol for 500 mm initial concentration at 0 5 ma cm2 lee et al 2017a symmetric anion selective electrodes separated by a cation exchange membrane desalinated 20 mm saltwater with both lower current density and lower asar with an sec of 3 6 kj mol and a concentration change of 3 mm at current densities of 0 75 ma cm2 or less arulrajan et al 2019 it must be noted that differing influent concentrations used in these experiments will impact the expected correlation between sec and asar compared to this work we also simulated desalination performance using our two dimensional time dependent model presented previously smith 2017 that assumes thin ideally permselective membranes and equal isotropic effective transport properties the increased sec relative to simulations shown in our experiments fig 5 a can thus be attributed to ohmic polarization agglomerate scale transport and transport anisotropy within porous electrodes in addition to these factors our simulations suggest that the transport of ions transverse to the flow direction has a significant impact on energy consumption we note in particular that substantially lower asar was achieved in experiments at the highest current density tested 8 ma cm2 top most point in fig 5a we attribute this discrepancy primarily to electron transport limitations in pba agglomerates as the present experiments produced approximately 30 charge capacity utilization relative to theoretical consistent with our previous work characterizing and modeling agglomerate scale transport at similar c rates shrivastava and smith 2018 fig 5b shows the simulated distribution of salt concentration within the cid flow cell at the end of one half cycle with transverse coordinate y and streamwise coordinate x near the outlet of the cell salt concentration variations transverse to the flow direction are evident resulting in a minimum concentration within the desalinating electrode c e m i n o u t that is substantially smaller than the mean effluent concentration c e o u t in that electrode further this transverse concentration difference δ c e t c e o u t c e m i n o u t increases as the applied current density increases our previous modeling hand et al 2019 liu and smith 2018 smith 2017 smith and dmello 2016 revealed similar effects that result from the cation transference number t in aqueous nacl t e 0 39 exceeding that of anion exchange membranes t m 0 by solving the salt transport equation see esm we find a closed form expression for the transverse concentration difference δ c e t δ c e t c e o u t c e x l y w i t w 3 d e f f f where d e f f m2 s is the effective chemical diffusion coefficient of salt among the current densities tested we find that this expression predicts δ c e t within 10 of our higher fidelity numerical simulations enabling its use in identifying conditions that prevent local salt depletion i e when δ c e t 0 when flow through cation intercalation electrodes are used 4 conclusions electrodes having different active particle and conductive additive size and mass fraction were fabricated here using a wet phase inversion process with polymer binder the effective transport properties of these electrodes were characterized using the four point probe method and a gravity driven apparatus to measure hydraulic permeability the different electrode formulations showed a complex interplay of effects that determine effective electronic conductivity porosity the macmullin number for ion conduction diffusion and hydraulic permeability smaller active particles showed better electronic and ionic conductivity with less carbon black loading but such electrodes were also less permeable than those made with larger active particles making electrodes more electronically conductive thus comes at the cost of lower permeability a tradeoff that will affect the relative contributions of electrical and pumping power requirements to total energy consumption in desalination we used a simplified analytical model of cell polarization to quantify the contributions to specific energy consumption through electronic conduction ionic conduction and feedwater pumping in so doing we constructed an electrochemical ashby diagram in which different electrode formulations are represented by their corresponding transport property triplet σ e f f κ e f f k h and contours in that space quantify salt removal rate asar at fixed specific energy consumption sec we found that increasing any one of these properties electronic conductivity ionic conductivity and permeability increases asar at fixed sec but for the electrode formulations tested electronic conductivity had the most significant influence on asar such methods can be used in the optimization of electrode formulations for other faradaic and capacitive deionization systems we note however that in addition to energy consumption material selection should also consider the constraints imposed by the limited pressure that can be sustained by seals within a given desalination flow cell using the results for electrodes fabricated with pseudo active particles high conductivity nickel hexacyanoferrate pba electrodes were fabricated using ketjen black conductive additive and were tested in a symmetric cation intercalation desalination cid device at varying current densities with 100 mm nacl feedwater these electrodes were able to reduce salt concentration over 25 mm at current densities several times higher up to 8 ma cm2 and at higher salt absorption rates up to 2 7 μmol cm2 min than previous cid studies thus understanding the interplay between transport properties and their variation with conductive additive loading can lead to superior performance in porous electrodes used for faradaic and capacitive deionization comparison of numerical modeling results with this experimental data suggests that solution phase mass transfer transverse to the flow direction could be enhanced to increase rate capability and decrease energy consumption in addition to electron transport within active particle agglomerates while the present experiments demonstrate substantial salt removal engineering of desalination cells and systems is needed to produce effluent salt concentrations to the levels needed for practical application e g drinking water production the present experiments showed that the electrodes fabricated are robust over the cycles tested but targeted investigation of capacity fade and electrode degradation processes are needed together with analysis of the impact of potential degradation products on water quality we also note that improvements can be made to the materials selection analysis to incorporate the effects of the finite charge capacity and local ion transport effects furthermore understanding the impact of electrode properties on selective electrochemical separations deserves

18514,deionization devices that use intercalation reactions to reversibly store and release cations from solution show promise for energy efficient desalination of alternative water resources intercalation materials often display low electronic conductivity that results in increased energy consumption during desalination accordingly we performed experiments to quantify the impact of the size and mass fraction of conductive additives and insulative active particles on the effective electronic conductivity ionic conductivity and hydraulic permeability of porous electrodes we find that ketjen black conductive additives with nodules 50 nm in diameter produce superior electronic conductivity at lower mass fractions than the larger carbon blacks commonly used in capacitive deionization hydraulic permeability and effective ionic conductivity depend weakly on carbon black content and size though smaller active particles decrease hydraulic permeability based on these results we analyzed the energy consumption and salt removal rate of different electrode formulations by constructing an electrochemical ashby plot predicting the variation of desalination performance with

that further improvements can be achieved but mechanistic understanding of rate and capacity limiting processes shrivastava and smith 2018 is needed to make cid competitive with reverse osmosis qin et al 2019 in this work we investigate the influence of conductive additives on the electronic conductivity ionic conductivity and hydraulic permeability of porous electrodes incorporating insulative particles after using theory to guide the selection of a particular electrode formulation on the basis of desalination energy consumption and rate we demonstrate cid cycling performance using optimized electrodes containing nickel hexacyanoferrate pba in a flow through cid cell while intercalation materials possess high capacity in comparison with the activated carbons typically used in conventional capacitive deionization cdi suss et al 2015 suss and presser 2018 intercalation materials often suffer from low electronic conductivity causing high energy consumption and slow charge

carbon blacks of various average radii to assess the tradeoffs in their transport properties with loading including effective electronic conductivity σ e f f recent modeling of coupled transport phenomena in fdi cells has shown that the flow of solution through electrodes rather than the flow of solution past electrodes can enhance desalination performance liu and smith 2018 the development of flow through electrode fte cdi cells with fluid flow and current density aligned in the same direction has also shown increased charging rates through the use of hierarchical suss et al 2012 and laser perforated guyes et al 2017 electrodes large volumes of electrolyte must permeate porous electrodes in fte configurations to facilitate operation at high rate accordingly pumping power and pressure which are functions of hydraulic permeability k h and cell design cannot be ignored when analyzing energy consumption tian et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 in the related field of redox flow batteries wherein electrolytes are often flowed through porous electrodes few studies have measured k h as a function of electrode composition despite its influence on pressure drop when using different flow channel configurations such as interdigitated parallel spiral and serpentine al yasiri and park 2018 2017 dennison et al 2015 for the electrodes that we fabricate in this work we measure k h and quantify its influence on energy consumption in desalination the finite ionic conductivity of porous electrodes in fdi cells leads to ohmic polarization and consequently irreversible energy consumption the macmullin number m c the ratio between the bulk ionic conductivity of the electrolyte κ 0 and its effective value κ e f f is determined by the size distribution and topology of electrode pores previous research has found macmullin number to depend on electrode porosity ε and particle shape as these factors determine the number and length of paths available for ions to travel through the electrode habte and jiang 2018 landesfeind et al 2016 the scaling of m c with ε is generally nonlinear due to the combined effects of the decreased throat size of pores and the increasingly tortuous path along which ions travel when porosity decreases these effects are captured by the bruggeman relation m c 1 ε 1 5 chung et al 2013 thorat et al 2009 which is valid only for certain microstructures with spherical particles electrodes composed of non spherical particles can have macmullin number and porosity related by the function m c 1 ε α where α is the bruggeman exponent landesfeind et al 2016 to circumvent this scaling we recently milled macroscopic pores into microporous cdi electrodes to enhance ionic conduction and reduce charging times reale and smith 2018 and such electrodes showed lower impedance higher adsorption rate and higher adsorption capacity than unmilled electrodes bhat et al 2019 thus in the present work we measure the tradeoffs between m c σ e f f and k h for various electrode processing conditions to maximize salt removal rate in fdi in capacitive deionization using edls performance has been quantified by relating specific energy consumption sec defined as the energy required to remove 1 mole of salt to the average salt adsorption rate asar defined as the average rate of salt removal per unit area of the electrode due to the decreasing ionic conductivity of effluent and the re salination time between adsorption and desorption steps the faster salt is removed in cdi the more energy is required hawks et al 2018 wang and lin 2018 thus cdi research has been motivated to increase asar without increasing sec another method of quantifying performance is the kim yoon or cdi ragone plot which compares deionization capacity to salt removal rate kim and yoon 2014 in contrast to these approaches wherein tradeoffs in performance metrics are quantified for a discrete set of materials the inverse problem can be posed wherein a space of material properties is defined with corresponding performance contours while such analyses have typically been relegated to mechanical problems using ashby diagrams ashby 2011 electrochemical materials selection maps have been constructed for redox flow batteries to minimize power losses due to ohmic resistance dmello et al 2016 wei et al 2015 and electrolyte cost dmello et al 2016 here we pose a materials selection problem for flow through fdi electrodes in the three dimensional σ e f f κ e f f k h space to maximize asar for fixed sec a brief outline of this work follows here to study the effects of electrode composition and particle size transport properties were measured for porous electrodes consisting of insulative powders of different particle size and carbon blacks with different specific surface areas alumina was selected as a pseudo active surrogate material for insulative active particles because of its low conductivity and abundance the use of which was ultimately validated by creating porous electrodes containing nihcf pba with an optimized electrode formulation the varying sizes of particles are shown to influence how ions and fluid move through the electrode microstructure we also introduce a framework for the selection of electrode materials based on these properties by modeling the energy losses arising from viscous flow through electrodes and ionic electronic ohmic polarization within electrodes at finite salt removal rate by targeting a high electronic conductivity using ketjen black with certain mass fraction pba electrodes were fabricated and tested in a cid cell 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrode preparation alumina al2o3 particles were used as a pseudo active material in place of insulative intercalation particles with two different diameters 1 μm advalue technology and 40 nm skyspring nanomaterials inc two different types of carbon black were combined with alumina to assess the impact of size and morphology on transport properties c45 mti xtl and ketjen black ec 600jd kb akzo nobel these two carbons show order of magnitude difference in specific surface area and particle radii 960 nm 45 m2 g particles for c45 compared to 34 nm 1270 m2 g for kb the various electrode slurries were prepared by mixing alumina and carbon black cb with alumina cb mass ratios from 95 0 to 87 5 7 5 each with 5 wt pvdf binder in all cases we note that previous cdi studies have used activated carbon electrodes with binder loading levels of approximately 10 wt abbas and pajak 2014 hassanvand et al 2017 lim et al 2009 the mass loading of binder was reduced here to produce a similar volume fraction to previous cdi experiments by accounting for alumina s two fold higher density than carbon 3 95 g cm3 versus 2 g cm3 powder mixtures were dispersed in nmp solvent and mixed in a thinky are 310 planetary mixer for 25 min followed by 5 min of deaeration to remove air bubbles due to electrode slurries containing nanoparticles being more viscous than slurries of microparticles a larger amount of nmp was used during mixing to cast such slurries for 1 μm diameter alumina particles only 1 ml of solvent was needed for each gram of the solid powder mixture while 1 5 ml g was needed to produce a castable slurry for 40 nm particles after thorough mixing slurries were cast using an elcometer film applicator onto either conducting graphite foil ceramaterials or non conducting ptfe ast industries inc substrates experiments measuring electronic and ionic conductivity used ptfe substrates to prevent the substrate from interfering with the measurements because ptfe has a conductivity of 10 14 s m measurements of hydraulic permeability were performed on electrodes supported on graphite foil to stabilize samples and to enable their precise arrangement in the testing apparatus once cast at a desired thickness level the electrode and substrate were immersed in deionized water to remove nmp solvent by a wet phase inversion process lim et al 2009 solidified electrodes were then air dried at room temperature to remove residual nmp electrodes were re immersed in either deionized water or 100 mm aqueous nacl for 12 h prior to testing to enable thorough wetting and to remove air bubbles 2 2 electronic and ionic conductivity electronic conductivity of the electrodes was measured using an inhouse built four point probe with gold coated 0 5 mm diameter pins spaced 2 mm apart to contact electrodes the small thickness of samples 100 μm compared to the probe spacing 2 mm makes the thin film approximation of four point probe theory valid once dried the electrodes were wetted in 100 mm aqueous nacl for 12 h to remove any air bubbles a four point probe method was used to measure effective electronic and ionic conductivity the details of which are described in the electronic supplementary material esm measured current between source probes i t a was fitted to a stretched exponential function with stretching factor β as in a previous study of edl formation and dissipation li et al 2017 1 i t i i e t τ β i e fits showed an average error of 5 at most and 1 in the best cases when compared to experimental data in the context of these experiments the initial i i and final i f currents are most important because ionic and electronic conductivity can be determined directly using their values as charge builds up in the edl on source probe tips ionic current declines until current can only move through the solid matrix the slope of the lower envelope of current versus potential in fig s2b esm is proportional to the sum of effective electronic σ e f f s m and ionic κ e f f s m conductivity while the slope of the upper envelope of current versus potential is proportional to effective ionic conductivity κ e f f kang et al 2017 2 σ f i n a l ln 2 π i e w v σ e f f 3 σ i n i t i a l ln 2 π i i i e w v σ e f f κ e f f here w m is the thickness of a given electrode and v v is the potential difference between the inner leads of the apparatus macmullin number m c was subsequently calculated as 4 m c κ 0 κ e f f where κ 0 is the ionic conductivity of 100 mm aqueous nacl at 298 k 1 067 s m chambers et al 1956 2 3 hydraulic permeability to measure the hydraulic permeability of porous electrodes 1 25 1 25 cm2 samples were cut from electrodes cast onto graphite foil and placed into a 0 5 mm deep channel through which deionized water was driven by a small hydraulic head δ p pa fig s3 esm the samples were wrapped in ptfe tape to seal them and to force solution flow exclusively through the porous electrode hydraulic head was supplied by a reservoir to ensure a consistent water level water flowed through the electrode over a period of 1 h after which the average fluid flow was calculated from the collected water mass to account for the no slip condition at the edges of our porous electrodes as in other work on redox flow batteries ke et al 2015 we solved the darcy brinkman equation analytically for the flow rate v m3 s through a rectangular cross section of thickness w depth d m and flow path length l m due to the 1 25 cm distance d being two orders larger than the electrode thickness lateral edge effects were ignored the effective viscosity term in the darcy brinkman equation has been shown by simulation to increase as porosity decreases martys et al 1994 starov and zhdanov 2001 here we assume that effective viscosity is inversely proportional to porosity μ e f f μ ε pa s in eq 5 as porosity decreases the flow rate approaches zero 5 v δ p k h μ w d l 1 4 k h w 2 ε tanh w 2 ε 4 k h permeability k h m2 was calculated by solving eq 5 numerically with measured flow rate and porosity using matlab porosity ε is dependent on the loading of each solid and it was calculated as ε 1 ρ t o t a l ρ s o l i d where ρ t o t a l g cm3 is the average dry electrode density and ρ s o l i d is the mass averaged density of the electrode constituents carbon black pseudo actives and pvdf 2 4 desalination experiments based on the result of conductivity measurements faradaic electrodes containing nickel hexacyanoferrate pba as an active material were fabricated for desalination experiments these electrodes used nanoscopic ketjen black particles as a conductive additive rather than the large c45 carbon black particles pba particles were prepared using the process developed previously shrivastava and smith 2018 electrodes contained 80 active material 10 ketjen black and 10 pvdf binder by mass and slurries were prepared using 3 ml of nmp per gram of powder mixture these slurries were cast solidified and dried using the same process as the alumina electrodes on a graphite foil substrate the desalination cell fig s4 esm used a pair of machined graphite sheets as current collectors and a flow field 3d printed using a polyjet eden 350 printer clamped together by a pair of laser cut delrin plates the area of both anode and cathode was 2 5 cm2 with approximately 150 μm thickness separated by an anion exchange membrane neosepta amx influent was supplied to the cell from a single large reservoir with 100 mm nacl concentration effluent concentration was measured using a pair of 17 μl flow through conductivity probes edaq flow was driven by a peristaltic pump masterflex l s to supply a flow rate of 0 25 ml min desalination tests were conducted by applying constant currents of 1 2 4 6 and 8 ma cm2 to the electrodes using a vmp 3 potentiostat while simultaneously measuring the effluent conductivity of the two channels values for equivalent conductance were used to calibrate the conductivity sensors for 100 mm influent chambers et al 1956 and the differences in measured conductivity were proportional to differences in concentration the difference in salt concentration between the influent and effluent was used to calculate charge efficiency which is the ratio between the number of charges from salt absorption and the applied current and the average salt absorption rate the energy consumed per mole of removed salt or specific energy consumption was found from the average power measured for that rate of salt removal 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrode transport property measurements measurements of electronic conductivity ionic conductivity and hydraulic permeability were performed on electrodes combining different loading levels of carbon black and alumina powders with 5 wt pvdf content producing cb alumina mass ratios equal to 0 0 95 0 2 5 92 5 5 0 90 0 and 7 5 87 5 electrodes containing greater quantities of carbon black were prone to cracking even when cast at low thicknesses we present results in terms of volume fraction rather than mass fraction to generalize our results to electrodes using active compounds with arbitrary mass density fig 1a shows effective electronic conductivity for the electrode samples tested in addition to the error caused by variations in electrode thickness measurements the possibility of hydrogen evolution in the electrolyte required an additional 10 error in the measurement of conductivity this error estimate is especially conservative at higher conductivities because the current produced by electrolysis would become less significant compared to electronic current as electrode conductivity increases the increasing volume fractions of carbon black in the case of electrodes using micro scale pseudo active and c45 particles show that additives do not significantly improve electronic conductivity until a certain threshold additive loading is reached this effect is attributed to the percolation of conductive additive networks that is required for electrons to access the high conductivity of carbon black at the macro scale in contrast for electrodes comprised primarily of nano scale pseudo active and ketjen black particles a volume fraction of less than 0 5 ketjen black caused an immediate increase in conductivity by an order of magnitude relative to an electrode without carbon black these findings suggest that ketjen black percolates more easily than c45 especially when nano scale pseudo active particles are mixed together with them electrodes with nano scale pseudo actives and ketjen black consistently showed higher conductivity for similar carbon black loading and ketjen black proved superior to c45 at improving conductivity though higher electronic conductivity can be achieved at lower mass or volume fractions by using smaller pseudo active particles at higher loadings electronic conductivity saturates to 1 2 s m furthermore testing electrodes with higher carbon black loading was limited by electrode cracking we also note that the porosities of the nanoparticulate electrodes were generally 10 higher than the electrodes made with microparticles resulting in a wider range of carbon black volume fractions despite identical mass fractions in the power mixture electrode macmullin number which is an inverse measure of effective ionic conductivity normalized by bulk ionic conductivity decreased with increasing volume fraction of carbon black except when compared with the electrodes only containing pseudo active particles fig 1 b thus we observe that adding carbon black to increase electronic conductivity also increases effective ionic conductivity this trend contrasts with previous measurements of tortuosity for li ion battery electrodes with varying levels of conductive additives this difference may be attributed to the fact that the pseudo active particles used in the present work are less than 1 μm in diameter compared to previous works using spheroids and flakes with dimensions exceeding 5 μm forouzan et al 2017 such large anisometric particles are likely to block more paths within pores and to impede ion transport than the smaller isometric ones used here in addition to the electronic and ionic conductivities of electrodes the hydraulic permeabilities of different electrode compositions are of interest for flow through electrodes we observe from fig 1c that electrodes using c45 and ketjen black with micro scale pseudo active particles possess different k h in contrast for electrodes using nano scale pseudo active particles hydraulic permeability shows a much less varied range of values remaining within 5 of each other we attribute the lower permeability in the case of electrodes using nano scale pseudo active particles relative to micron scale particles to the smaller pores produced by smaller particles this effect is also noticeable when comparing electrodes made with ketjen black and c45 when electrode particles pack together larger particles produce larger pores and higher permeability electrodes made using micro scale pseudo active particles showed greater variation in permeability with carbon black content than electrodes made with nano scale particles because pseudo active nanoparticles and carbon black particles were similar in size both being 50 nm the addition of ketjen black to those electrodes affected their average pore diameter to a minimal extent this conclusion is consistent with our data showing smaller permeability for electrodes made with ketjen black particles relative to those made with the larger c45 particles to validate our use of alumina as an insulative pseudo active compound we also measured the transport properties of an electrode containing prussian blue analogue pba nanoparticles carbon black and pvdf the results are directly compared to those for electrodes using pseudo active particles in table 1 when pba particles were combined with ketjen black the electronic conductivity of pba electrodes was fifty fold larger than when combined with c45 while only a three fold increase was observed in the case of the alumina permeability for the pba and alumina electrodes was on the same order of magnitude though the pba electrodes were more resistant to flow the macmullin number of pba ketjen black electrodes was 31 smaller than pba c45 electrodes while hydraulic permeability was 12 lower for pba ketjen black sem images of the two pba electrodes in fig 2 reveal that the electrode with ketjen black appears significantly rougher than with c45 the c45 electrode has larger agglomerates and thus binder is spread over less area and obscures solid particles while ketjen black particles are visible and appear more distributed through the microstructure 3 2 analysis of energy consumption in porous electrodes the electronic conductivity σ e f f ionic conductivity κ e f f and hydraulic permeability k h of porous electrodes will influence how an fdi device using them performs in terms of energy consumption specifically energy losses arise from electronic resistance ionic resistance and pumping power in addition to baseline energy consumption due to the gibbs free energy of separation specific energy consumption sec or the amount of energy needed to remove 1 mole of salt from feedwater is a commonly used metric to quantify these effects in cdi furthermore sec is inherently a function of the average salt adsorption rate asar defined as the average salt absorbed for a unit electrode area over one minute wang and lin 2018 to put the transport properties that we have measured in context for fdi applications we presently construct an ashby diagram to project their impact on asar for a specified sec level each point in this materials selection map is defined by a transport property triplet σ e f f κ e f f k h we use analytical modeling to construct contours of constant sec and asar so as to define guidelines for materials selection for certain σ e f f κ e f f k h we select an operating flow rate in terms of applied current density by using a balance of charges when salt concentration is reduced from a feed stream with concentration c e i n mm by a desired amount δ c e l c e i n c e o u t where the mean effluent concentration is c e o u t and the subscript l denotes a longitudinal concentration difference after assuming a simple series resistance model for electronic and ionic resistances an analytical expression for sec kj mol can be derived in terms of asar μmol cm2 min σ e f f and κ e f f see esm 6 s e c a s a r z f λ 2 w κ e f f w σ e f f μ k h l 2 w 1 δ c e l 2 where z λ μ f w and l are cation valence charge efficiency viscosity faraday s constant electrode thickness and flow path length using this result we construct contours of asar for a given sec with varying κ e f f σ e f f and k h to show the combinations of electrode properties that are necessary to reach a desired asar as shown in fig 3 concave surfaces comprise these contours because increasing one of the three transport properties reduces a portion of energy consumption enough that only the other two contributions remain significant the further out a point is along all three axes the higher an asar that is attainable fig 3 shows that electronic conductivity ionic conductivity and permeability can all be increased to reduce the overall sec of an electrode if a particular asar is required however the energy demands of the three transport properties are each independent of the others and even if one could be increased by orders of magnitude the energy demands would become dominated by the others ionic conductivity is particularly difficult to control which has motivated research aiming to reduce macmullin number for the purpose of making cdi a viable technology nemani et al 2015 reale and smith 2018 bhat et al 2019 permeability has also been the subject of efforts to improve the performance of cdi via the addition of macroscopic pores to reduce flow resistance guyes et al 2017 numerous examples of work with various carbon black additives have attempted to improve electronic conductivity liu et al 2007 nadakatti et al 2011 shetzline and creager 2014 the materials tested show permeability an order of magnitude above what is necessary however the varying macmullin numbers and order of magnitude variations in electronic conductivity limit the possible asar 3 3 desalination experiments after completing experiments varying the carbon black content of the electrodes pba electrodes were fabricated using 10wt ketjen black rather than c45 due to the former carbon black s demonstrated superiority as a conductive additive electrode samples with 2 5 cm2 area were then used in a symmetric cid cell with the flow of electrolyte through electrodes galvanostatic cycling of the electrodes was performed at current densities of 1 8 ma cm2 with a flow rate of 0 25 ml min and 100 mm nacl influent the desalinating electrode intercalated sodium ions from influent while chloride passed through the aem into the counter electrode resulting in the inlet to outlet concentration differences and voltage variations shown in fig 4 a for a current density of 6 ma cm2 the change in concentration is approximately linearly dependent on current density as increasing the current at a certain flow rate ideally removes a proportional amount of salt fig 4b at 1 ma cm2 the pba particles showed a specific capacity of 50 55 mah g for one electrode mass per battery convention and a salt absorption capacity of 54 5 60 mg g for two electrode masses per cdi convention capacity decreased with increasing current though the values at each current density remained stable across the ten cycles performed subsequent tests showed capacity at 1 ma cm2 returned to over 50 mah g and the average over ten cycles was 1 2 greater than the average for the initial ten cycles fig 4c charge efficiency ce was highest at low current densities and the decline of ce caused a drop in the measured concentration difference fig 4d at 8 ma cm2 the performance of the cell declined significantly likely an effect due to poor flow efficiency and short residence times in the cell hawks et al 2018 a certain volume of effluent must flow out of the electrode during each cycling period while also reaching the conductivity meter to be measure salinity however reduced capacity at high current caused a given half cycle to complete too quickly for example at 8 ma cm2 half cycle time was less than 60 s with an electrode volume of approximately 36 μl the volume of fluid in the electrode flowed less than seven times during each half cycle reliable conductivity measurement also becomes more difficult due to the time that the fluid exiting the electrode needs to reach the conductivity sensor being similar to the half cycle time in sec 3 2 our theoretical estimation of power consumption for a given salt removal level assumes an infinite charge capacity and constant effluent salt concentrations however our experimental data here shows that charging time limits reliable measurement and calculation of salt removal to confirm the superiority of ketjen black over c45 shown in tests with alumina electrodes pba electrodes containing 10wt c45 were also prepared and tested in the fdi cell under identical conditions direct property comparisons between the different electrodes are shown in table 1 of sec 3 1 at a current density of 1 ma cm2 their capacity was less than 5 of that measured for the pba ketjen black electrodes with a maximum concentration change of less than 2 mm at current densities of 2 ma cm2 and above pba c45 electrodes did not function reliably and could not produce useable experimental data analysis of net electrical energy input showed relatively low sec for the asar values observed showing substantial improvements in specific energy consumption and current density previous cid cells using multiple intervening ion exchanges membranes reported values of 14 7 kj mol for 50 mm influent and 0 57 ma cm2 kim et al 2017 while the present experiments using optimized electrodes produce lower sec for current densities as high as 4 ma cm2 our initial demonstration of cid using flow behind pba electrodes decreased salt concentration from 20 mm nacl influent by only 0 5 mm at 0 14 ma cm2 while consuming 15 kj mol porada et al 2017 other work using dissimilar pbas in a cid configuration reported an sec of 5 0 kj mol for 500 mm initial concentration at 0 5 ma cm2 lee et al 2017a symmetric anion selective electrodes separated by a cation exchange membrane desalinated 20 mm saltwater with both lower current density and lower asar with an sec of 3 6 kj mol and a concentration change of 3 mm at current densities of 0 75 ma cm2 or less arulrajan et al 2019 it must be noted that differing influent concentrations used in these experiments will impact the expected correlation between sec and asar compared to this work we also simulated desalination performance using our two dimensional time dependent model presented previously smith 2017 that assumes thin ideally permselective membranes and equal isotropic effective transport properties the increased sec relative to simulations shown in our experiments fig 5 a can thus be attributed to ohmic polarization agglomerate scale transport and transport anisotropy within porous electrodes in addition to these factors our simulations suggest that the transport of ions transverse to the flow direction has a significant impact on energy consumption we note in particular that substantially lower asar was achieved in experiments at the highest current density tested 8 ma cm2 top most point in fig 5a we attribute this discrepancy primarily to electron transport limitations in pba agglomerates as the present experiments produced approximately 30 charge capacity utilization relative to theoretical consistent with our previous work characterizing and modeling agglomerate scale transport at similar c rates shrivastava and smith 2018 fig 5b shows the simulated distribution of salt concentration within the cid flow cell at the end of one half cycle with transverse coordinate y and streamwise coordinate x near the outlet of the cell salt concentration variations transverse to the flow direction are evident resulting in a minimum concentration within the desalinating electrode c e m i n o u t that is substantially smaller than the mean effluent concentration c e o u t in that electrode further this transverse concentration difference δ c e t c e o u t c e m i n o u t increases as the applied current density increases our previous modeling hand et al 2019 liu and smith 2018 smith 2017 smith and dmello 2016 revealed similar effects that result from the cation transference number t in aqueous nacl t e 0 39 exceeding that of anion exchange membranes t m 0 by solving the salt transport equation see esm we find a closed form expression for the transverse concentration difference δ c e t δ c e t c e o u t c e x l y w i t w 3 d e f f f where d e f f m2 s is the effective chemical diffusion coefficient of salt among the current densities tested we find that this expression predicts δ c e t within 10 of our higher fidelity numerical simulations enabling its use in identifying conditions that prevent local salt depletion i e when δ c e t 0 when flow through cation intercalation electrodes are used 4 conclusions electrodes having different active particle and conductive additive size and mass fraction were fabricated here using a wet phase inversion process with polymer binder the effective transport properties of these electrodes were characterized using the four point probe method and a gravity driven apparatus to measure hydraulic permeability the different electrode formulations showed a complex interplay of effects that determine effective electronic conductivity porosity the macmullin number for ion conduction diffusion and hydraulic permeability smaller active particles showed better electronic and ionic conductivity with less carbon black loading but such electrodes were also less permeable than those made with larger active particles making electrodes more electronically conductive thus comes at the cost of lower permeability a tradeoff that will affect the relative contributions of electrical and pumping power requirements to total energy consumption in desalination we used a simplified analytical model of cell polarization to quantify the contributions to specific energy consumption through electronic conduction ionic conduction and feedwater pumping in so doing we constructed an electrochemical ashby diagram in which different electrode formulations are represented by their corresponding transport property triplet σ e f f κ e f f k h and contours in that space quantify salt removal rate asar at fixed specific energy consumption sec we found that increasing any one of these properties electronic conductivity ionic conductivity and permeability increases asar at fixed sec but for the electrode formulations tested electronic conductivity had the most significant influence on asar such methods can be used in the optimization of electrode formulations for other faradaic and capacitive deionization systems we note however that in addition to energy consumption material selection should also consider the constraints imposed by the limited pressure that can be sustained by seals within a given desalination flow cell using the results for electrodes fabricated with pseudo active particles high conductivity nickel hexacyanoferrate pba electrodes were fabricated using ketjen black conductive additive and were tested in a symmetric cation intercalation desalination cid device at varying current densities with 100 mm nacl feedwater these electrodes were able to reduce salt concentration over 25 mm at current densities several times higher up to 8 ma cm2 and at higher salt absorption rates up to 2 7 μmol cm2 min than previous cid studies thus understanding the interplay between transport properties and their variation with conductive additive loading can lead to superior performance in porous electrodes used for faradaic and capacitive deionization comparison of numerical modeling results with this experimental data suggests that solution phase mass transfer transverse to the flow direction could be enhanced to increase rate capability and decrease energy consumption in addition to electron transport within active particle agglomerates while the present experiments demonstrate substantial salt removal engineering of desalination cells and systems is needed to produce effluent salt concentrations to the levels needed for practical application e g drinking water production the present experiments showed that the electrodes fabricated are robust over the cycles tested but targeted investigation of capacity fade and electrode degradation processes are needed together with analysis of the impact of potential degradation products on water quality we also note that improvements can be made to the materials selection analysis to incorporate the effects of the finite charge capacity and local ion transport effects furthermore understanding the impact of electrode properties on selective electrochemical separations deserves attention in addition to their impact on the treatment of feedwaters containing mixtures of different cations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
