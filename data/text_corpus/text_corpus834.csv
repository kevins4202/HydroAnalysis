4170,groundwater contaminant source identification gcsi can provide support for the confirmation of responsibility and the remediation of pollution this study has developed an innovative combination algorithm to recognize source properties and model parameters in groundwater contamination simultaneously the research idea is based on bayes theory and combines an ensemble smoother es algorithm differential evolutionary markov chain demc algorithm and adaptive kriging surrogate model aksm poor selection of initial estimates for unknown variables will slow down the convergence rate therefore the initial points are not generated completely randomly but are partially obtained by the es algorithm after the initial points have been determined the demc algorithm is used to recognize source properties and model parameters in groundwater contamination to improve the efficiency of the demc algorithm the updating formula was adjusted by introducing information about the optimal chain into the iteration however the inversion process is time consuming because both the es and demc algorithms need to run the original simulation model frequently to solve this problem an aksm was established for the original simulation model which greatly accelerated the inversion process different hypothetical cases with different complexities were used to illustrate the validity of the combination algorithm the identification results implied that the combination algorithm had not only faster convergence but also higher accuracy these improvements were more evident in the second case and third case this implies that the proposed method will play a greater role with increasing problem complexity keywords inverse modeling bayes theory ensemble smoother algorithm differential evolutionary markov chain algorithm adaptive kriging surrogate model 1 introduction in the continuous human pursuit of development we have a great impact on nature pollution is one of these impacts which is receiving increasing attention groundwater pollution is a special kind of pollution because it occurs below the surface we cannot easily observe it moreover often when pollution is found the pollution source has been discharging for an extended period of time which poses great challenges for confirmation of responsibility and pollution remediation pan et al 2021 wang et al 2020 groundwater contaminant source identification gcsi as a research topic has been proposed to address this challenge and received great attention gcsi uses the limited actual observed data on groundwater including groundwater levels and contaminant concentrations and a priori information to obtain information on groundwater contaminant sources this information mainly includes the number of contaminant sources their spatial locations and release history at present commonly used gcsi techniques are divided into the following classifications the first is the simulation optimization so method this approach takes the deviation between the observed data and the calculated value of the simulation model as the objective function and finds a set of parameter values to make the objective function minimized and thus to obtain the parameters vrugt et al 2008 genetic algorithms ayvaz 2016 singh and datta 2006 simulated annealing algorithms prakash and datta 2015 yeh et al 2007 and particle swarm optimization algorithms guneshwor et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 are algorithms that are often used in gcsi however for cases with fewer observed data points and more unknown parameters the uncertainty of the problem is greatly augmented and the so method may be inefficient zhang et al 2015a the second approach is the simulation random statistics srs method which can deal with the uncertainty of gcsi problems and improve the reliability of identification results wei et al 2016 zeng et al 2012 the bayesian inversion method which is a kind of stochastic method that requires much computation is commonly used to improve efficiency it is often combined with surrogate models chang et al 2020 however when the dimensionality is too high the search efficiency of the method is still low and it has difficulty converging to the posterior distribution another approach is the kalman filter kf method which is derived from a data assimilation method and was later developed for gcsi problems two methods are commonly used today the ensemble kalman filter enkf chen et al 2018a chen et al 2018b xu and gomez hernandez 2016 and the ensemble smoother es ju et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 however the limitation of this kind of method is that it requires the unknown variables to obey the gaussian hypothesis although the data can be transformed the transformation and restoration will also consume much computing time the various methods each have their own advantages and disadvantages previous studies have generally used only one kind of method for gcsi but each method has its own limitations if researchers learn from each other and take advantage of different methods inversion efficiency can be greatly improved in this study the es was combined with the bayesian method to identify contaminant source characteristics the results of the former were used as the initial points of the latter to improve inversion efficiency the monte carlo markov chain mcmc algorithms are used in the sampling of the posterior distribution constructed by bayes formula the first algorithms that appeared were single chain algorithms such as the m h hastings 1970 ap haario et al 1999 am haario et al 2001 and dram algorithms haario et al 2006 the disadvantage of these single chain algorithms is that it is difficult to judge whether they have converged to a posteriori distribution moreover single chain algorithms fall easily into local optima and it is difficult to fully explore the whole parameter space vrugt 2016 later researchers tried to combine the mcmc algorithm with a population optimization algorithm to obtain multi chain algorithms such as the scem ua vrugt et al 2003 demc ter braak 2006 and dream algorithms vrugt et al 2009 these multi chain algorithms have been proved to have good results for complex target function however when dealing with high dimensional problems the search efficiency still needs to be improved therefore to improve the efficiency of the demc algorithm the authors adjusted the updating formula by iteratively introducing information about the optimal chain the selection of initial points or initial estimates is an important factor in determining the efficiency of an algorithm although it has been proved mathematically that mcmc can converge to a posteriori distribution if it is run long enough a poor selection of initial position will slow down the convergence rate serfozo 2009 there has been little previous research on the selection of initial value points li et al 2021 tried to combine the homotopy algorithm ha with an optimization algorithm to prove that a good initial point selection can improve the accuracy of inversion identification results however the ha needs to solve multiple optimization problems which takes a huge amount of time therefore this study has attempted to use the es algorithm to select the initial point because the es algorithm has been proved to have strong robustness in many studies emerick and reynolds 2013 mo et al 2019 the objective was to enrich the method of initial point selection so that later researchers have more choices whether using the so srs or kf method simulation models must be called thousands of times in the iterative process which will consume much computing time and generate a huge computing load li et al 2019 yan et al 2019 surrogate models are an effective way to solve this problem which can greatly save computing time especially in complex physical models chen et al 2017 chen et al 2018a chen et al 2018b and have been widely used in the groundwater field asher et al 2015 among the studies using surrogate models the precision of the surrogate models is a hot issue on the one hand some researchers have explored new surrogate modeling theories and strategies hou and lu 2018 mo et al 2019 wang and lu 2020 on the other hand other researchers have started from the training samples of surrogate models to obtain more valuable training samples ju et al 2018 mo et al 2017 inspired by previous studies zhang et al 2016 an adaptive surrogate model was developed by combining es and kriging to update training samples iteratively in previous studies the selection of an initial point was rarely addressed however a good beginning brings one halfway to success because good initial points can improve search efficiency in this study the es and demc algorithms were combined to identify groundwater pollution source characteristics and model parameters simultaneously the es algorithm was used to select the initial points the identification results from the es algorithm were used as the initial points of the demc algorithm to improve inversion efficiency an iterative updating strategy was used to build an adaptive kriging surrogate model aksm the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides necessary details about the methodology used in this paper three hypothetical cases and implementation steps are described in section 3 in section 4 some analysis and discussion of the results are presented finally conclusions are provided in section 5 2 theoretical framework 2 1 simulation model the first step in solving the inversion problem is to set up the simulation models including the groundwater flow simulation model and solute transport simulation model the governing equation describing the two dimensional steady flow in a confined aquifer can be expressed as 1 x i t ij h x j w i j 1 2 where x i x j are the coordinates along the axis h is the groundwater head t ij is the element of the transmissivity tensor t w is the volume of water flowing in or out in the vertical direction per unit time and area the governing equation describing the transport of a nonreactive pollutant can be expressed as singh and datta 2006 2 θ c t x i θ d ij c x j x i θ c v i c s w b i j 1 2 where θ the effective porosity c is the pollutant concentration d ij the element of the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor d c s the pollutant concentration in a source or sink b the thickness of the aquifer and v i the average velocity in direction x i 2 2 source identification 2 2 1 homotopy algorithm the ha is a method of solving nonlinear equations that originated from algebraic topology zhang et al 2015b the basic idea of the ha is to construct a system of equations that is easy to solve starting from the solution of the newly constructed system of equations the solution of the original system can be obtained through path tracking osborne et al 2000 in gcsi problems the homotopy parameter λ is introduced to construct a family of homotopy functions h x λ when λ 0 the solution of the equation h x λ 0 is the properties of the assumed groundwater pollution sources and when λ 1 the solution of the equation h x λ 0 is the properties of the real groundwater pollution sources the linear homotopy equations are constructed as follows 3 h x λ i λ i m x 1 λ i n x 0 i 1 p m x f x y f x y t n x f x y 0 f x y 0 t where m x and n x are artificial nonlinear functions f x is the output of the original model with given parameters x y is the observed value and y 0 is the original model output with the given assumed parameters due to the ill posed nature of gcsi problems the solutions of these equations may not exist therefore the equations must be transformed into minimum optimization problems and an optimization algorithm used to solve them because the path tracking process is gradually evolving during the solution process the solutions are also very close in two adjacent problems the solution of the previous problem is used as the initial value of the next problem to avoid premature convergence in the optimization process hou et al 2021 2 2 2 ensemble smoother besides the so and srs methods another class of methods that are widely used in source identification are methods based on linear estimation theory such as the enkf and the es li et al 2018 these methods are based on the cross correlation between unknown parameters and states and update the unknown parameters and states using the observed values because inversion using enkf or es is based on the cross correlation between model parameters and states the process does not need to call the system model and therefore its calculation cost is often very low to enhance the performance of the es algorithm the data of all periods were directly used and an iterative convergence criterion was added the specific operating procedures of the adjusted es are as follows 1 obtain ne parameter vectors from prior probability distribution as the initial parameter ensemble x 0 x 1 0 x ne 0 where the superscript represents the current iteration index and the subscript represents the sequence number of the sample in the ensemble 2 update the parameter ensemble of the previous iteration x j 1 x 1 j 1 x ne j 1 with the observed values y 4 x k j x k j 1 c xy c yy r 1 y k f x k j 1 k 1 n e where y k is the observed value with random error y k y ε k ε k is the random samples of the observed error f x k j 1 is the output of the original model with given parameters x k j 1 c yy is the auto covariance matrix of y j 1 c xy is the cross covariance matrix of x j 1 and y j 1 f x 1 j 1 f x ne j and r is the covariance matrix of observation error 3 repeat the second step until one of the convergence conditions is met 1 s x j 1 s x j s x j ξ 2 the current number of iterations j is greater than the maximum number of iterations i max where ξ is a predetermined parameter that can be set according to demand and s x j is the matching degree of the data defined as follows 5 s x j k 1 ne y k f x k j r 1 y k f x k j t 2 2 3 the bayes theory the bayes theory is an important theory in statistics which is often used in inversion the core of the bayes theory can be described as 6 p x y p x p y x p y p y x d x where x represents the parameters y is the observed data p x y is the posterior distribution of parameters p x is the prior distribution of parameters and p y x is the likelihood function the denominator is an integration constant that ensures that the posterior distribution is normalized jiang et al 2021 when applying bayes theory to inversion the difficulty is that the likelihood function has no explicit analytical form in most numerical models therefore the integration constant is difficult to calculate wu et al 2011 monte carlo markov chain mcmc is developed to avoid the calculation of integral constant the product of the prior distribution and the likelihood function can be regarded as an un normalized posterior distribution π x which can be expressed as 7 π x p y x p x sampling from π x is mathematically equivalent to directly sampling from a posterior distribution there are several mcmc algorithms that are widely investigated vrugt 2016 in this study the multi chain mcmc algorithm demc was adopted to solve the gcsi problems 2 2 4 differential evolutionary markov chain demc algorithm the demc algorithm that integrates the essential ideas of de and mcmc is a multiple chains algorithm ter braak 2006 compared with single chain algorithms multiple chains algorithms have more advantages in dealing with complex posterior distributions vrugt 2016 demc uses de algorithm as a candidate point generation algorithm with a metropolis criterion to decide whether to accept the candidate point or not in the demc algorithm n different chains are operated in parallel x t 1 i denotes the parameter vector of the i th chain at generation t 1 the candidate point x p i is generated as 8 x p i x t 1 i γ d x t 1 a x t 1 b ζ d the candidate point x p i is accepted with probability 9 α x t 1 i x p i min 1 π x p i π x t 1 i where γ d 2 38 2 d is the jumping rate a and b are integers generated from a set 1 i 1 i 1 n ζ d ñ 0 b d is drawn from a normal distribution with a small standard deviation b 10 6 and π is the density function of the target distribution a random number u is obtained from a uniform distribution u 0 1 if u α x t 1 i x p i then accept the candidate point that is x t i x p i otherwise x t i x t 1 i to speed up algorithm convergence the best chain information available is introduced into the formula for generating candidate points the new formula is 10 x p i x t 1 i γ d x t 1 a x t 1 best x t 1 b x t 1 c ζ d where x t 1 best is the parameter values of the best chain at generation t 1 and c is an integer value drawn from 1 i 1 i 1 n 2 3 adaptive kriging surrogate model aksm iteratively adding new training data over the posterior probability distribution is a significant strategy to refine the surrogate ju et al 2018 therefore the adaptive strategy was used to combine the kriging surrogate model ksm and the es algorithm the ksm was improved adaptively by iteratively adding more training data close to the posterior confidence intervals the adaptive scheme is effective at solving gcsi problems chang et al 2020 the construction of an aksm with an es process is presented in fig 1 and can be expressed as follows step 1 obtain ne parameter vectors from prior probability distribution as the initial parameter ensemble x 0 x 1 0 x ne 0 and run the original simulation model to get the corresponding outputs y 0 f x 1 0 f x ne 0 x 0 and y 0 constitute the initial training ensemble then randomly choose m m ne samples from the primary training ensemble to build a primary ksm step 2 obtain ne parameter vectors by applying the es algorithm with the observed data and the updated ksm the parameter ensemble can be updated with the es formula step 3 verify the precision of the ksm using m test samples randomly select m parameter vectors from the updated parameter ensemble x j the corresponding model outputs are then obtained by running the original simulation model the test data consists of m parameter vectors and corresponding model outputs are used to verify the precision of the ksm step 4 if the precision satisfies demands the iteration is terminated if the precision demands are not satisfied the test data are added to the training data to improve the ksm and steps 2 3 are repeated 3 case studies 3 1 basic introduction to the cases several different cases were used to illustrate the effectiveness of the combination algorithm in this section basic information about the cases is introduced in all cases it was presumed that the discharged pollutant was typically nonreactive the first case had one pollution source and nine unknown parameters whereas the second case had two pollution sources and twenty unknown parameters it is obvious that the latter case is more complex in addition a more complex example is set up which is three dimensional and takes into account the gaussian conductivity field it is based on a three dimensional groundwater model zhang et al 2020 on which the boundary conditions are adjusted and a pollution source is added the purpose of the different cases is to prove that the demc with es initial point selection is effective by applying the algorithm to cases with different complexity in this paper hypothetical examples were used for case studies the advantage being that the identification results can be easily compared with the true values and therefore the effectiveness of the proposed combination algorithm can be verified yan et al 2019 3 1 1 case 1 fig 2 a shows a plan view of case 1 this case has an irregular range with a length of 2500 m and a width of 1500 m and there is a confined aquifer which is generalized as two dimensional heterogeneous and isotropic the ad and bc boundaries are impermeable and the ab and cd boundaries have a constant pressure head 100 m and 80 m there are three parameter zones with hydraulic conductivities k of 28 50 27 64 and 18 51 m d respectively table 1a provides the aquifer parameters the total simulation time was taken as 30 months and was divided into five periods on average it was assumed that the pollution source discharged contaminant in the first three periods during the process of inversion it was assumed that the unknown gcsi parameters were the hydraulic conductivities k1 k2 and k3 the longitudinal dispersity α l the coordinates of the contamination source lx and ly and the discharge intensities of the contamination source s1 s2 and s3 the prior information of parameters shown in table 2a and the observed data in fig 3 a were available the objective was to recognize the nine unknown gcsi parameters 3 1 2 case 2 in case 2 there were two pollution sources in this aquifer as shown in fig 2 b the boundary conditions were the same as in case 1 however the aquifer parameters were partly different shown in table 1b the total simulation time was set to be 36 months and was equally divided into 12 periods the two contamination sources were assumed to discharge contaminant during the first six periods the hydraulic conductivities k1 k2 and k3 the longitudinal dispersity α l the coordinates of the two contamination sources lx1 ly1 lx2 and ly2 and the discharge intensities of the two contamination sources in the first six periods were presumed to be unknown during the process of inversion in this case prior information was used as shown in table 2b as well as observed data in fig 3 b to identify the twenty unknown gcsi parameters 3 1 3 case 3 the third case study considers three dimensional simulation model of steady state groundwater flow and contaminant transport this model refers to a three dimensional groundwater flow model proposed by zhang et al 2020 the model is divided into three layers in vertical direction with thickness of 1 8 m 1 4 m and 1 8 m respectively each layer is equidistant divided into 35 columns and 40 rows with a grid of 2 m in the direction of columns and 1 5 m in the direction of rows on the left and right sides of the flow region there are constant head boundaries of h 60 03 m and h 59 97 m respectively and the others are non flow boundaries an artificial well is located at row 18 and column 17 which pumps water from each horizontal layer at a constant rate of 0 01 l min furthermore the pollution source is located in the first layer of row 18 and column 6 and its release intensities in the first three pressure periods is 3183 3290 and 1198 g d respectively the total simulation time was set to be 12 months and was equally divided into 12 periods to characterize the heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity field k x y is adopted logarithmic transformation of hydraulic conductivity κ log k x y obeys gaussian distribution here mean and variance of the log conductivity fields are μ κ 3 and σ κ 0 231 and the correlation lengths are 30 m and 35 m respectively for the three layers to reduce parametric dimensionality we use a kl decomposition of the conductivity field of each layer zhang and lu 2004 about 40 kl terms are deemed sufficient to represent the log conductivity field of each layer and preserve about 90 of the field variance in addition the hydraulic conductivity not only has high heterogeneity but also has anisotropy contaminant concentration measurements at the three layers from 81 wells located every four rows from row 3 to row 35 every three columns from column 5 to column 29 are generated from the reference true fields depicted in the left column of fig 13 table 1c provides the rest of aquifer parameters in this case the unknown gcsi parameters are 120 kl terms ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 120 and the release intensities of the contamination source in first three stress periods s 1 s 2 s 3 where the prior distribution of ξ i is independent standard normal distribution and s i is uniform distribution from 1000 to 4000 3 2 construction of the aksm an adaptive strategy can obtain more valuable data meaning that a more accurate model can be built with fewer data points ju et al 2018 in a previous study the authors integrated scam and ksm to construct an adaptive surrogate model chang et al 2020 in this study a faster method which required fewer original model calls and therefore was faster was used to combine es and ksm this section explains how to construct an aksm firstly sufficient initial training data should be obtained the capacity of training ensemble for the ksm must be greater than n 1 n 2 2 where n is the dimension of the input data jin 2005 therefore the capacity of initial training ensemble was set to 200 in case 1 and 500 in case 2 the training ensemble consist of input and output data the input data were generated by the latin hypercube sampling from the prior distributions of unknown parameters as shown in tables 2a and 2b the output data were obtained by operating the original models then randomly choose a certain number of samples from the initial training ensemble to build a primary ksm a new parameter ensemble with the same number of initial training data was produced by the es formula test samples were randomly selected from the new parameter ensemble to evaluate the precision of the ksm new training samples are added iteratively until the precision requirements are met the capacity of final training ensemble was 300 in case 1 and 800 in case 2 the correlation coefficient r 2 and the relative error re were selected to evaluate the precision of the aksm 1 correlation coefficient r 2 11 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n is the total number of outputs in the test sample y i is the simulation model output y i is the aksm output and y is the average of y i the closer r 2 is to 1 the more precise the aksm is 2 relative error re 12 re y i y i y i i 1 n 3 3 source identification process after the aksm has been constructed it can be used for subsequent inversion work first the es algorithm is used to determine the initial point in the study cases ξ was set to 0 01 and i max was set to 100 to further illustrate the efficiency of the es algorithm it was compared with ha the ha process needs to solve a series of optimization problems in this paper the most widely used genetic algorithm ga was used to solve each optimization problem table 3 gives the parameter settings for the ga the initial point obtained by the es algorithm was used in the demc algorithm demc is a kind of multi chain mcmc algorithm that can sample the posterior distribution constructed by the bayes formula the posterior probability function p x y is proportional to the product of the likelihood function p y x and the prior probability function p x the prior probability function can be obtained by summarizing the prior information about the unknown parameters as shown in tables 2a and 2b and the likelihood function can be calculated by the following formula 13 p y x 1 2 π n 2 r 1 2 exp 1 2 y f x r 1 y f x t where y is a vector containing the observed data x is a vector containing the unknown gcsi parameters r is the covariance matrix of the observation error r is the determinant of r f is an operator that implies the calculated value solved by the original simulation model in this case it refers to the surrogate model although the analytic expression of posterior probability function cannot be obtained mcmc algorithm can be used to extract samples directly from posterior distribution when the chains converge in this paper the potential scale reduction factor psrf gelman and rubin 1992 and the multivariate psrf mpsrf brooks et al 2003 were used to judge whether convergence had been achieved statistical analysis of the samples was carried out after mcmc chain convergence 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance of the surrogate model the effectiveness of the aksm in the two cases is presented in fig 4 the figure shows the re of five observation wells at each moment for test samples in the first two cases evidently the maximum re of case 1 was less than 7 and that of case 2 was less than 15 the overall re was low indicating that the aksm has high accuracy and can replace the original model in addition by comparing the precision of the aksm in case 1 where the average re and r2 were 0 975 and 0 9995 respectively with that in case 2 where the average re and r2 were 2 014 and 0 9911 respectively it is obvious that the former case obtained more accurate results than the latter this occurred mainly because case 2 had higher dimensionality and more complexity than case 1 fig 5 shows the accuracy of the aksm model in case 3 the average re and r 2 were 0 397 and 0 9994 this result is surprising because in case 3 we have more dimensional inputs and more dimensional outputs but the accuracy of the surrogate model is higher than that in case 1 and case 2 this may be because in case 1 and case 2 although the dimension is low the nonlinearity of the model is higher so the accuracy of the surrogate model is lower than that of case 3 however further discussion is beyond the scope of this paper and will not be described in detail here although it is very convenient to use a surrogate model in inversion it is very time consuming to develop a globally accurate surrogate model when the original model has high dimensionality and strong nonlinearity gong and duan 2017 if too much time is spent on building a surrogate model the original intention is defeated therefore many studies have investigated how to obtain more valuable samples so that less time and cost are needed to develop a more accurate surrogate model in this paper an adaptive method proposed in earlier studies was introduced zhang et al 2016 ksm and es were combined to build an aksm in the adaptive framework and good results were achieved however the ksm as a shallow learning method does not perform well for strongly nonlinear problems it will therefore be necessary in future research to combine deep learning theory with an adaptive framework to build an adaptive deep learning surrogate model that can perform well on problems with strong nonlinearity 4 2 evaluation of the initial point selection fig 6 shows a comparison of identification accuracy between the es and ha the re between the identification results and the true values was used to express the accuracy in the case 1 and case 2 the re of the es was lower in case 1 the average re and maximum re of the es were 2 38 and 13 64 respectively which were much less than the 14 64 and 42 23 obtained by the ha in case 2 the contrast is more obvious these results show that the es can provide an initial point closer to the real value in addition the running time of the es in the first two cases was 4 6 s and 7 1 s respectively while that of the ha was 12297 6 s and 77132 6 s on a workstation with an intel r xeon r cpu e5 2630 v3 2 40 ghz dual processor and 64 gb ram this shows that the running time of the es is much less than that of the ha comprehensive analysis of these data shows that compared with the ha the es can provide a better initial point in a shorter time and improve inversion efficiency in previous studies the initial point was often chosen randomly but when the initial point is too far from the true value the search process will waste much time in regions of no interest therefore it is very important to select a good initial point in this study the es was used to determine the initial point compared with the ha it needs less running time and can provide a better initial point however research on initial point selection is still insufficient this paper is intended to arouse interest in studying the initial point selection in the hope that more interesting research will be carried out on related aspects 4 3 analysis of source identification results fig 7 presents iterative trace plots of the convergence index the psrf for the nine parameters in case 1 using the demc fig 7 a and the demc with es initial point selection fig 7 b different parameters are represented by different colors each graph uses red dotted lines to define a threshold value at 1 2 when the psrf of all parameters is lower than the threshold the markov chains can be considered to have converged to a stable distribution the demc required about 1 800 iterations to meet the threshold the demc with es initial point selection needed substantially fewer iterations about 1000 these results imply an improvement in convergence rate these initial findings are inspiring but they would be meaningless if they were just an accident to generalize these findings the simulations with the demc and the demc with es initial point selection were repeated five times randomly the simulation results are shown in fig 8 which shows traces of the convergence index mpsrf for the repetitions using the demc blue lines and the demc with es initial point selection red lines the results in fig 8 are consistent with the earlier findings of this study indeed the demc with es initial point selection always needed fewer iterations to converge to the posterior distribution the search capabilities of the two algorithms are shown in fig 9 this figure presents the logarithmic values of the likelihood function sampled by both the demc blue dots and the demc with es initial point selection red dots in case 2 the likelihood function can be used to express the degree of closeness between the observed and calculated values the larger the likelihood function the closer are the observed and calculated values when using multi chain mcmc the likelihood function of each generation has more than one value and therefore the mean value is calculated and used to represent the whole fig 9 shows that the likelihood function of the demc with es initial point selection is not only higher than that of the demc at the beginning but is also generally higher in the later stages of iteration this indicates that the search efficiency of the whole iterative process can be improved by selecting the initial point through the es algorithm the previous results show that the proposed combination algorithm has faster convergence rate and higher search efficiency however these improvements are meaningless if the demc with es initial point selection does not approximate the target distribution correctly fig 10 and fig 11 show plots of the posterior probability distributions of the unknown parameters obtained from the demc blue dashed lines and the demc with es initial point selection red lines in the first two cases the true values of the unknown parameters are separately indicated by a black vertical solid line the approximate posterior probability distributions of both algorithms are very similar and are well concentrated near the true values this implies that the demc with es initial point selection successfully approximates the target distribution in addition the posterior distribution peak estimated by the proposed method is closer to the true value which is less obvious in case 1 but more obvious in case 2 in practice the true values of the unknown parameters cannot be known it is impossible to verify the accuracy of inversion by comparing the true values with the identification results therefore additional observed data were provided to solve this problem these data were the observed concentrations of the five observation wells during the test period the identification results were brought into the original model and the simulation data were compared with the additional observed data as shown in fig 12 the closer the simulation data are to the additional observed data the more accurate the identification results fig 12 shows a fitted graph of the observed and simulation data the red square represents the demc and the blue diamond represents the demc with es initial point selection the closer the marker is to the line y x the closer the simulation data are to the observed data fig 12 clearly shows that the blue mark is closer to the line y x which indicates that the identification results of the demc with es initial point selection are better this is even more obvious in fig 12 b the correlation coefficient and the relative errors of the observed and simulation data were also calculated in case 1 the difference between the two algorithms was not obvious with values of 0 9959 1 70 and 0 9982 1 40 respectively in case 2 the difference is more obvious with values of 0 9552 6 73 and 0 9901 3 07 respectively it can be concluded that the proposed method can improve the accuracy more significantly in case 2 this implies that the proposed method will play a greater role at higher problem dimension moreover it significantly reduced computing time to apply the aksm for the gsci problem in the demc algorithm 4000 iterations were demanded in case 1 and every iteration required 20 calls of the original model to calculate the outputs the original model for case 1 needed about 67 h of cpu time to finish 80 000 simulations on the workstation mentioned earlier whereas the aksm took about two hours to construct and run the model the time savings are obvious and more so in case 2 the times taken were 1111 h in the original model and 5 h including the running time and building time of the model in the surrogate respectively however although the fidelity of the surrogate model output was close to that of the simulation model the error between the aksm and the original models may have a slight impact on the results this is also a worthwhile problem but it is not within the scope of this paper and will be studied in future research to better illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed combination algorithm case 3 which is a case with higher dimension is established fig 13 show plots of the posterior probability distributions of release intensity in the first three stress periods obtained from the demc blue dashed lines and the demc with es initial point selection red lines in case 3 the results show that there is no significant difference between the posterior distributions obtained by the two algorithms the peak of a posteriori probability distribution indicates that the probability of the parameters falling near it is the largest it can be seen from the figure that the peak of the posterior probability distribution obtained by the combination algorithm is closer to the true value and the corresponding peak is more prominent this implies that the combination algorithm accumulates more samples near the true value and made more exploration around here fig 14 and fig 15 shows that the posterior mean and variances of conductivity field is obtained from different algorithms it can be seen from the fig 14 that the conductivity fields obtained by the two algorithms are very close to the real conductivity fields through the correlation coefficient r2 it can be further seen that the posterior mean conductivity obtained by the combination algorithm is closer to the real one the variance diagram obtained by the two algorithms can be seen from fig 15 the variance distribution of the two algorithms is similar indicating that the posterior distribution of the two algorithms is similar moreover the variance of both algorithms is at a low level and the variance of the combination algorithm is relatively small it shows that the two algorithms are convergent and the ensemble obtained by the combination algorithm is more concentrated these results are very encouraging which shows that the combination algorithm has higher accuracy but these cannot explain the efficiency of the algorithm so we launched a further study fig 16 shows the iterative trace of rmse between the observed and calculated values the smaller the rmse is the smaller the error between the observed value and the calculated value is the better the fitting effect is it can be seen from the figure that the rmse of the combination algorithm decreases sharply at the beginning of the iteration and decreases to below 0 90 at about 900 iterations while the rmse of the demc algorithm needs 18 000 iterations to reach about 0 90 in the later stage of iteration the rmse of demc algorithm is about 0 87 while the rmse of combination algorithm is about 0 46 therefore it can be seen that the combined algorithm has higher efficiency than the demc algorithm fig 17 show the logarithmic values of the likelihood function sampled by both the demc blue dots and the demc with es initial point selection red dots in case 3 in fig 17 we can observe the same situation as fig 9 it can be seen that the likelihood function value of the combined algorithm is always higher than that of the demc algorithm moreover this situation is more obvious in fig 17 than in fig 9 it also shows that the proposed combination algorithm will play a more significant role with the increase of dimension the three common methods used for gcsi are the so srs and kf methods in past research one of these methods was often used however each method has its own limitations recently researchers have used some new approaches to break through these limitations for example in the so method the uncertainty was assumed and the inversion was carried out li et al 2020 the mcmc algorithm has been improved to accelerate its convergence speed on high dimensional problems zhang et al 2020 in the kf method the normal score has been used to transform a non gaussian distribution into a gaussian distribution xu and jaime gomez hernandez 2018 this study attempts to overcome the limitations of the methods themselves from another point of view through the joint use of different methods therefore the es and demc algorithms were combined in this study to identify groundwater pollution sources and good results were obtained hopefully more researchers will try to combine different methods in the future to produce more valuable combinations in this paper es algorithm and demc algorithm are combined to get a new algorithm and the proposed algorithm is applied in different cases which has achieved good results it proves that the proposed method has good applicability and can be used in many cases however the combination of this paper only takes the identification results of es algorithm as the initial points of the demc algorithm and the connection between the algorithms is not close enough if we can make the algorithms more closely combined we may achieve better results and hope that we can continue to make efforts in this aspect in the future research 5 conclusions this study combined the es and demc algorithms to simultaneously recognize source properties and simulation model parameters in groundwater contamination the es algorithm was used to select the initial point to better illustrate the advantages of the es algorithm it was compared with the ha then the identification results of the es algorithm were used as the initial point of the demc algorithm the updating formula was adjusted by introducing information about the optimal chain to improve the efficiency of the demc algorithm this gave the algorithm faster convergence and higher identification accuracy to improve overall computational efficiency an iterative updating strategy was used to develop an adaptive kriging surrogate model different hypothetical cases were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed combination algorithm these cases represented different levels of complexity case 2 had more complexity and higher dimensionality than case 1 the comparison of the es and ha shows that the es can provide better initial points in a shorter time thus improving inversion efficiency the identification results show that the proposed combination algorithm has not only faster convergence but also higher accuracy these improvements are more evident in case 2 and case 3 this implies that the proposed method will play a greater role with increasing problem complexity the selection of initial points the initial estimation of parameters has an important influence on the efficiency of the algorithm in the previous research hou et al 2021 li et al 2021 homotopy algorithm and optimization algorithm are combined to improve the initial point gradually but it is very time consuming to solve the optimization model many times therefore the es algorithm is proposed to select the initial point which not only greatly reduces the calculation time but also provides the initial point closer to the true value and es is not limited by its gaussian distribution because it only serves as the initial value mcmc algorithm has low search efficiency in high dimension problems zhang et al 2020 therefore this paper improves the multi chain mcmc algorithm demc which can improve the updating formula by using the information of the optimal chain and improve the search

4170,groundwater contaminant source identification gcsi can provide support for the confirmation of responsibility and the remediation of pollution this study has developed an innovative combination algorithm to recognize source properties and model parameters in groundwater contamination simultaneously the research idea is based on bayes theory and combines an ensemble smoother es algorithm differential evolutionary markov chain demc algorithm and adaptive kriging surrogate model aksm poor selection of initial estimates for unknown variables will slow down the convergence rate therefore the initial points are not generated completely randomly but are partially obtained by the es algorithm after the initial points have been determined the demc algorithm is used to recognize source properties and model parameters in groundwater contamination to improve the efficiency of the demc algorithm the updating formula was adjusted by introducing information about the optimal chain into the iteration however the inversion process is time consuming because both the es and demc algorithms need to run the original simulation model frequently to solve this problem an aksm was established for the original simulation model which greatly accelerated the inversion process different hypothetical cases with different complexities were used to illustrate the validity of the combination algorithm the identification results implied that the combination algorithm had not only faster convergence but also higher accuracy these improvements were more evident in the second case and third case this implies that the proposed method will play a greater role with increasing problem complexity keywords inverse modeling bayes theory ensemble smoother algorithm differential evolutionary markov chain algorithm adaptive kriging surrogate model 1 introduction in the continuous human pursuit of development we have a great impact on nature pollution is one of these impacts which is receiving increasing attention groundwater pollution is a special kind of pollution because it occurs below the surface we cannot easily observe it moreover often when pollution is found the pollution source has been discharging for an extended period of time which poses great challenges for confirmation of responsibility and pollution remediation pan et al 2021 wang et al 2020 groundwater contaminant source identification gcsi as a research topic has been proposed to address this challenge and received great attention gcsi uses the limited actual observed data on groundwater including groundwater levels and contaminant concentrations and a priori information to obtain information on groundwater contaminant sources this information mainly includes the number of contaminant sources their spatial locations and release history at present commonly used gcsi techniques are divided into the following classifications the first is the simulation optimization so method this approach takes the deviation between the observed data and the calculated value of the simulation model as the objective function and finds a set of parameter values to make the objective function minimized and thus to obtain the parameters vrugt et al 2008 genetic algorithms ayvaz 2016 singh and datta 2006 simulated annealing algorithms prakash and datta 2015 yeh et al 2007 and particle swarm optimization algorithms guneshwor et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 are algorithms that are often used in gcsi however for cases with fewer observed data points and more unknown parameters the uncertainty of the problem is greatly augmented and the so method may be inefficient zhang et al 2015a the second approach is the simulation random statistics srs method which can deal with the uncertainty of gcsi problems and improve the reliability of identification results wei et al 2016 zeng et al 2012 the bayesian inversion method which is a kind of stochastic method that requires much computation is commonly used to improve efficiency it is often combined with surrogate models chang et al 2020 however when the dimensionality is too high the search efficiency of the method is still low and it has difficulty converging to the posterior distribution another approach is the kalman filter kf method which is derived from a data assimilation method and was later developed for gcsi problems two methods are commonly used today the ensemble kalman filter enkf chen et al 2018a chen et al 2018b xu and gomez hernandez 2016 and the ensemble smoother es ju et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 however the limitation of this kind of method is that it requires the unknown variables to obey the gaussian hypothesis although the data can be transformed the transformation and restoration will also consume much computing time the various methods each have their own advantages and disadvantages previous studies have generally used only one kind of method for gcsi but each method has its own limitations if researchers learn from each other and take advantage of different methods inversion efficiency can be greatly improved in this study the es was combined with the bayesian method to identify contaminant source characteristics the results of the former were used as the initial points of the latter to improve inversion efficiency the monte carlo markov chain mcmc algorithms are used in the sampling of the posterior distribution constructed by bayes formula the first algorithms that appeared were single chain algorithms such as the m h hastings 1970 ap haario et al 1999 am haario et al 2001 and dram algorithms haario et al 2006 the disadvantage of these single chain algorithms is that it is difficult to judge whether they have converged to a posteriori distribution moreover single chain algorithms fall easily into local optima and it is difficult to fully explore the whole parameter space vrugt 2016 later researchers tried to combine the mcmc algorithm with a population optimization algorithm to obtain multi chain algorithms such as the scem ua vrugt et al 2003 demc ter braak 2006 and dream algorithms vrugt et al 2009 these multi chain algorithms have been proved to have good results for complex target function however when dealing with high dimensional problems the search efficiency still needs to be improved therefore to improve the efficiency of the demc algorithm the authors adjusted the updating formula by iteratively introducing information about the optimal chain the selection of initial points or initial estimates is an important factor in determining the efficiency of an algorithm although it has been proved mathematically that mcmc can converge to a posteriori distribution if it is run long enough a poor selection of initial position will slow down the convergence rate serfozo 2009 there has been little previous research on the selection of initial value points li et al 2021 tried to combine the homotopy algorithm ha with an optimization algorithm to prove that a good initial point selection can improve the accuracy of inversion identification results however the ha needs to solve multiple optimization problems which takes a huge amount of time therefore this study has attempted to use the es algorithm to select the initial point because the es algorithm has been proved to have strong robustness in many studies emerick and reynolds 2013 mo et al 2019 the objective was to enrich the method of initial point selection so that later researchers have more choices whether using the so srs or kf method simulation models must be called thousands of times in the iterative process which will consume much computing time and generate a huge computing load li et al 2019 yan et al 2019 surrogate models are an effective way to solve this problem which can greatly save computing time especially in complex physical models chen et al 2017 chen et al 2018a chen et al 2018b and have been widely used in the groundwater field asher et al 2015 among the studies using surrogate models the precision of the surrogate models is a hot issue on the one hand some researchers have explored new surrogate modeling theories and strategies hou and lu 2018 mo et al 2019 wang and lu 2020 on the other hand other researchers have started from the training samples of surrogate models to obtain more valuable training samples ju et al 2018 mo et al 2017 inspired by previous studies zhang et al 2016 an adaptive surrogate model was developed by combining es and kriging to update training samples iteratively in previous studies the selection of an initial point was rarely addressed however a good beginning brings one halfway to success because good initial points can improve search efficiency in this study the es and demc algorithms were combined to identify groundwater pollution source characteristics and model parameters simultaneously the es algorithm was used to select the initial points the identification results from the es algorithm were used as the initial points of the demc algorithm to improve inversion efficiency an iterative updating strategy was used to build an adaptive kriging surrogate model aksm the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides necessary details about the methodology used in this paper three hypothetical cases and implementation steps are described in section 3 in section 4 some analysis and discussion of the results are presented finally conclusions are provided in section 5 2 theoretical framework 2 1 simulation model the first step in solving the inversion problem is to set up the simulation models including the groundwater flow simulation model and solute transport simulation model the governing equation describing the two dimensional steady flow in a confined aquifer can be expressed as 1 x i t ij h x j w i j 1 2 where x i x j are the coordinates along the axis h is the groundwater head t ij is the element of the transmissivity tensor t w is the volume of water flowing in or out in the vertical direction per unit time and area the governing equation describing the transport of a nonreactive pollutant can be expressed as singh and datta 2006 2 θ c t x i θ d ij c x j x i θ c v i c s w b i j 1 2 where θ the effective porosity c is the pollutant concentration d ij the element of the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor d c s the pollutant concentration in a source or sink b the thickness of the aquifer and v i the average velocity in direction x i 2 2 source identification 2 2 1 homotopy algorithm the ha is a method of solving nonlinear equations that originated from algebraic topology zhang et al 2015b the basic idea of the ha is to construct a system of equations that is easy to solve starting from the solution of the newly constructed system of equations the solution of the original system can be obtained through path tracking osborne et al 2000 in gcsi problems the homotopy parameter λ is introduced to construct a family of homotopy functions h x λ when λ 0 the solution of the equation h x λ 0 is the properties of the assumed groundwater pollution sources and when λ 1 the solution of the equation h x λ 0 is the properties of the real groundwater pollution sources the linear homotopy equations are constructed as follows 3 h x λ i λ i m x 1 λ i n x 0 i 1 p m x f x y f x y t n x f x y 0 f x y 0 t where m x and n x are artificial nonlinear functions f x is the output of the original model with given parameters x y is the observed value and y 0 is the original model output with the given assumed parameters due to the ill posed nature of gcsi problems the solutions of these equations may not exist therefore the equations must be transformed into minimum optimization problems and an optimization algorithm used to solve them because the path tracking process is gradually evolving during the solution process the solutions are also very close in two adjacent problems the solution of the previous problem is used as the initial value of the next problem to avoid premature convergence in the optimization process hou et al 2021 2 2 2 ensemble smoother besides the so and srs methods another class of methods that are widely used in source identification are methods based on linear estimation theory such as the enkf and the es li et al 2018 these methods are based on the cross correlation between unknown parameters and states and update the unknown parameters and states using the observed values because inversion using enkf or es is based on the cross correlation between model parameters and states the process does not need to call the system model and therefore its calculation cost is often very low to enhance the performance of the es algorithm the data of all periods were directly used and an iterative convergence criterion was added the specific operating procedures of the adjusted es are as follows 1 obtain ne parameter vectors from prior probability distribution as the initial parameter ensemble x 0 x 1 0 x ne 0 where the superscript represents the current iteration index and the subscript represents the sequence number of the sample in the ensemble 2 update the parameter ensemble of the previous iteration x j 1 x 1 j 1 x ne j 1 with the observed values y 4 x k j x k j 1 c xy c yy r 1 y k f x k j 1 k 1 n e where y k is the observed value with random error y k y ε k ε k is the random samples of the observed error f x k j 1 is the output of the original model with given parameters x k j 1 c yy is the auto covariance matrix of y j 1 c xy is the cross covariance matrix of x j 1 and y j 1 f x 1 j 1 f x ne j and r is the covariance matrix of observation error 3 repeat the second step until one of the convergence conditions is met 1 s x j 1 s x j s x j ξ 2 the current number of iterations j is greater than the maximum number of iterations i max where ξ is a predetermined parameter that can be set according to demand and s x j is the matching degree of the data defined as follows 5 s x j k 1 ne y k f x k j r 1 y k f x k j t 2 2 3 the bayes theory the bayes theory is an important theory in statistics which is often used in inversion the core of the bayes theory can be described as 6 p x y p x p y x p y p y x d x where x represents the parameters y is the observed data p x y is the posterior distribution of parameters p x is the prior distribution of parameters and p y x is the likelihood function the denominator is an integration constant that ensures that the posterior distribution is normalized jiang et al 2021 when applying bayes theory to inversion the difficulty is that the likelihood function has no explicit analytical form in most numerical models therefore the integration constant is difficult to calculate wu et al 2011 monte carlo markov chain mcmc is developed to avoid the calculation of integral constant the product of the prior distribution and the likelihood function can be regarded as an un normalized posterior distribution π x which can be expressed as 7 π x p y x p x sampling from π x is mathematically equivalent to directly sampling from a posterior distribution there are several mcmc algorithms that are widely investigated vrugt 2016 in this study the multi chain mcmc algorithm demc was adopted to solve the gcsi problems 2 2 4 differential evolutionary markov chain demc algorithm the demc algorithm that integrates the essential ideas of de and mcmc is a multiple chains algorithm ter braak 2006 compared with single chain algorithms multiple chains algorithms have more advantages in dealing with complex posterior distributions vrugt 2016 demc uses de algorithm as a candidate point generation algorithm with a metropolis criterion to decide whether to accept the candidate point or not in the demc algorithm n different chains are operated in parallel x t 1 i denotes the parameter vector of the i th chain at generation t 1 the candidate point x p i is generated as 8 x p i x t 1 i γ d x t 1 a x t 1 b ζ d the candidate point x p i is accepted with probability 9 α x t 1 i x p i min 1 π x p i π x t 1 i where γ d 2 38 2 d is the jumping rate a and b are integers generated from a set 1 i 1 i 1 n ζ d ñ 0 b d is drawn from a normal distribution with a small standard deviation b 10 6 and π is the density function of the target distribution a random number u is obtained from a uniform distribution u 0 1 if u α x t 1 i x p i then accept the candidate point that is x t i x p i otherwise x t i x t 1 i to speed up algorithm convergence the best chain information available is introduced into the formula for generating candidate points the new formula is 10 x p i x t 1 i γ d x t 1 a x t 1 best x t 1 b x t 1 c ζ d where x t 1 best is the parameter values of the best chain at generation t 1 and c is an integer value drawn from 1 i 1 i 1 n 2 3 adaptive kriging surrogate model aksm iteratively adding new training data over the posterior probability distribution is a significant strategy to refine the surrogate ju et al 2018 therefore the adaptive strategy was used to combine the kriging surrogate model ksm and the es algorithm the ksm was improved adaptively by iteratively adding more training data close to the posterior confidence intervals the adaptive scheme is effective at solving gcsi problems chang et al 2020 the construction of an aksm with an es process is presented in fig 1 and can be expressed as follows step 1 obtain ne parameter vectors from prior probability distribution as the initial parameter ensemble x 0 x 1 0 x ne 0 and run the original simulation model to get the corresponding outputs y 0 f x 1 0 f x ne 0 x 0 and y 0 constitute the initial training ensemble then randomly choose m m ne samples from the primary training ensemble to build a primary ksm step 2 obtain ne parameter vectors by applying the es algorithm with the observed data and the updated ksm the parameter ensemble can be updated with the es formula step 3 verify the precision of the ksm using m test samples randomly select m parameter vectors from the updated parameter ensemble x j the corresponding model outputs are then obtained by running the original simulation model the test data consists of m parameter vectors and corresponding model outputs are used to verify the precision of the ksm step 4 if the precision satisfies demands the iteration is terminated if the precision demands are not satisfied the test data are added to the training data to improve the ksm and steps 2 3 are repeated 3 case studies 3 1 basic introduction to the cases several different cases were used to illustrate the effectiveness of the combination algorithm in this section basic information about the cases is introduced in all cases it was presumed that the discharged pollutant was typically nonreactive the first case had one pollution source and nine unknown parameters whereas the second case had two pollution sources and twenty unknown parameters it is obvious that the latter case is more complex in addition a more complex example is set up which is three dimensional and takes into account the gaussian conductivity field it is based on a three dimensional groundwater model zhang et al 2020 on which the boundary conditions are adjusted and a pollution source is added the purpose of the different cases is to prove that the demc with es initial point selection is effective by applying the algorithm to cases with different complexity in this paper hypothetical examples were used for case studies the advantage being that the identification results can be easily compared with the true values and therefore the effectiveness of the proposed combination algorithm can be verified yan et al 2019 3 1 1 case 1 fig 2 a shows a plan view of case 1 this case has an irregular range with a length of 2500 m and a width of 1500 m and there is a confined aquifer which is generalized as two dimensional heterogeneous and isotropic the ad and bc boundaries are impermeable and the ab and cd boundaries have a constant pressure head 100 m and 80 m there are three parameter zones with hydraulic conductivities k of 28 50 27 64 and 18 51 m d respectively table 1a provides the aquifer parameters the total simulation time was taken as 30 months and was divided into five periods on average it was assumed that the pollution source discharged contaminant in the first three periods during the process of inversion it was assumed that the unknown gcsi parameters were the hydraulic conductivities k1 k2 and k3 the longitudinal dispersity α l the coordinates of the contamination source lx and ly and the discharge intensities of the contamination source s1 s2 and s3 the prior information of parameters shown in table 2a and the observed data in fig 3 a were available the objective was to recognize the nine unknown gcsi parameters 3 1 2 case 2 in case 2 there were two pollution sources in this aquifer as shown in fig 2 b the boundary conditions were the same as in case 1 however the aquifer parameters were partly different shown in table 1b the total simulation time was set to be 36 months and was equally divided into 12 periods the two contamination sources were assumed to discharge contaminant during the first six periods the hydraulic conductivities k1 k2 and k3 the longitudinal dispersity α l the coordinates of the two contamination sources lx1 ly1 lx2 and ly2 and the discharge intensities of the two contamination sources in the first six periods were presumed to be unknown during the process of inversion in this case prior information was used as shown in table 2b as well as observed data in fig 3 b to identify the twenty unknown gcsi parameters 3 1 3 case 3 the third case study considers three dimensional simulation model of steady state groundwater flow and contaminant transport this model refers to a three dimensional groundwater flow model proposed by zhang et al 2020 the model is divided into three layers in vertical direction with thickness of 1 8 m 1 4 m and 1 8 m respectively each layer is equidistant divided into 35 columns and 40 rows with a grid of 2 m in the direction of columns and 1 5 m in the direction of rows on the left and right sides of the flow region there are constant head boundaries of h 60 03 m and h 59 97 m respectively and the others are non flow boundaries an artificial well is located at row 18 and column 17 which pumps water from each horizontal layer at a constant rate of 0 01 l min furthermore the pollution source is located in the first layer of row 18 and column 6 and its release intensities in the first three pressure periods is 3183 3290 and 1198 g d respectively the total simulation time was set to be 12 months and was equally divided into 12 periods to characterize the heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity field k x y is adopted logarithmic transformation of hydraulic conductivity κ log k x y obeys gaussian distribution here mean and variance of the log conductivity fields are μ κ 3 and σ κ 0 231 and the correlation lengths are 30 m and 35 m respectively for the three layers to reduce parametric dimensionality we use a kl decomposition of the conductivity field of each layer zhang and lu 2004 about 40 kl terms are deemed sufficient to represent the log conductivity field of each layer and preserve about 90 of the field variance in addition the hydraulic conductivity not only has high heterogeneity but also has anisotropy contaminant concentration measurements at the three layers from 81 wells located every four rows from row 3 to row 35 every three columns from column 5 to column 29 are generated from the reference true fields depicted in the left column of fig 13 table 1c provides the rest of aquifer parameters in this case the unknown gcsi parameters are 120 kl terms ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 120 and the release intensities of the contamination source in first three stress periods s 1 s 2 s 3 where the prior distribution of ξ i is independent standard normal distribution and s i is uniform distribution from 1000 to 4000 3 2 construction of the aksm an adaptive strategy can obtain more valuable data meaning that a more accurate model can be built with fewer data points ju et al 2018 in a previous study the authors integrated scam and ksm to construct an adaptive surrogate model chang et al 2020 in this study a faster method which required fewer original model calls and therefore was faster was used to combine es and ksm this section explains how to construct an aksm firstly sufficient initial training data should be obtained the capacity of training ensemble for the ksm must be greater than n 1 n 2 2 where n is the dimension of the input data jin 2005 therefore the capacity of initial training ensemble was set to 200 in case 1 and 500 in case 2 the training ensemble consist of input and output data the input data were generated by the latin hypercube sampling from the prior distributions of unknown parameters as shown in tables 2a and 2b the output data were obtained by operating the original models then randomly choose a certain number of samples from the initial training ensemble to build a primary ksm a new parameter ensemble with the same number of initial training data was produced by the es formula test samples were randomly selected from the new parameter ensemble to evaluate the precision of the ksm new training samples are added iteratively until the precision requirements are met the capacity of final training ensemble was 300 in case 1 and 800 in case 2 the correlation coefficient r 2 and the relative error re were selected to evaluate the precision of the aksm 1 correlation coefficient r 2 11 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n is the total number of outputs in the test sample y i is the simulation model output y i is the aksm output and y is the average of y i the closer r 2 is to 1 the more precise the aksm is 2 relative error re 12 re y i y i y i i 1 n 3 3 source identification process after the aksm has been constructed it can be used for subsequent inversion work first the es algorithm is used to determine the initial point in the study cases ξ was set to 0 01 and i max was set to 100 to further illustrate the efficiency of the es algorithm it was compared with ha the ha process needs to solve a series of optimization problems in this paper the most widely used genetic algorithm ga was used to solve each optimization problem table 3 gives the parameter settings for the ga the initial point obtained by the es algorithm was used in the demc algorithm demc is a kind of multi chain mcmc algorithm that can sample the posterior distribution constructed by the bayes formula the posterior probability function p x y is proportional to the product of the likelihood function p y x and the prior probability function p x the prior probability function can be obtained by summarizing the prior information about the unknown parameters as shown in tables 2a and 2b and the likelihood function can be calculated by the following formula 13 p y x 1 2 π n 2 r 1 2 exp 1 2 y f x r 1 y f x t where y is a vector containing the observed data x is a vector containing the unknown gcsi parameters r is the covariance matrix of the observation error r is the determinant of r f is an operator that implies the calculated value solved by the original simulation model in this case it refers to the surrogate model although the analytic expression of posterior probability function cannot be obtained mcmc algorithm can be used to extract samples directly from posterior distribution when the chains converge in this paper the potential scale reduction factor psrf gelman and rubin 1992 and the multivariate psrf mpsrf brooks et al 2003 were used to judge whether convergence had been achieved statistical analysis of the samples was carried out after mcmc chain convergence 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance of the surrogate model the effectiveness of the aksm in the two cases is presented in fig 4 the figure shows the re of five observation wells at each moment for test samples in the first two cases evidently the maximum re of case 1 was less than 7 and that of case 2 was less than 15 the overall re was low indicating that the aksm has high accuracy and can replace the original model in addition by comparing the precision of the aksm in case 1 where the average re and r2 were 0 975 and 0 9995 respectively with that in case 2 where the average re and r2 were 2 014 and 0 9911 respectively it is obvious that the former case obtained more accurate results than the latter this occurred mainly because case 2 had higher dimensionality and more complexity than case 1 fig 5 shows the accuracy of the aksm model in case 3 the average re and r 2 were 0 397 and 0 9994 this result is surprising because in case 3 we have more dimensional inputs and more dimensional outputs but the accuracy of the surrogate model is higher than that in case 1 and case 2 this may be because in case 1 and case 2 although the dimension is low the nonlinearity of the model is higher so the accuracy of the surrogate model is lower than that of case 3 however further discussion is beyond the scope of this paper and will not be described in detail here although it is very convenient to use a surrogate model in inversion it is very time consuming to develop a globally accurate surrogate model when the original model has high dimensionality and strong nonlinearity gong and duan 2017 if too much time is spent on building a surrogate model the original intention is defeated therefore many studies have investigated how to obtain more valuable samples so that less time and cost are needed to develop a more accurate surrogate model in this paper an adaptive method proposed in earlier studies was introduced zhang et al 2016 ksm and es were combined to build an aksm in the adaptive framework and good results were achieved however the ksm as a shallow learning method does not perform well for strongly nonlinear problems it will therefore be necessary in future research to combine deep learning theory with an adaptive framework to build an adaptive deep learning surrogate model that can perform well on problems with strong nonlinearity 4 2 evaluation of the initial point selection fig 6 shows a comparison of identification accuracy between the es and ha the re between the identification results and the true values was used to express the accuracy in the case 1 and case 2 the re of the es was lower in case 1 the average re and maximum re of the es were 2 38 and 13 64 respectively which were much less than the 14 64 and 42 23 obtained by the ha in case 2 the contrast is more obvious these results show that the es can provide an initial point closer to the real value in addition the running time of the es in the first two cases was 4 6 s and 7 1 s respectively while that of the ha was 12297 6 s and 77132 6 s on a workstation with an intel r xeon r cpu e5 2630 v3 2 40 ghz dual processor and 64 gb ram this shows that the running time of the es is much less than that of the ha comprehensive analysis of these data shows that compared with the ha the es can provide a better initial point in a shorter time and improve inversion efficiency in previous studies the initial point was often chosen randomly but when the initial point is too far from the true value the search process will waste much time in regions of no interest therefore it is very important to select a good initial point in this study the es was used to determine the initial point compared with the ha it needs less running time and can provide a better initial point however research on initial point selection is still insufficient this paper is intended to arouse interest in studying the initial point selection in the hope that more interesting research will be carried out on related aspects 4 3 analysis of source identification results fig 7 presents iterative trace plots of the convergence index the psrf for the nine parameters in case 1 using the demc fig 7 a and the demc with es initial point selection fig 7 b different parameters are represented by different colors each graph uses red dotted lines to define a threshold value at 1 2 when the psrf of all parameters is lower than the threshold the markov chains can be considered to have converged to a stable distribution the demc required about 1 800 iterations to meet the threshold the demc with es initial point selection needed substantially fewer iterations about 1000 these results imply an improvement in convergence rate these initial findings are inspiring but they would be meaningless if they were just an accident to generalize these findings the simulations with the demc and the demc with es initial point selection were repeated five times randomly the simulation results are shown in fig 8 which shows traces of the convergence index mpsrf for the repetitions using the demc blue lines and the demc with es initial point selection red lines the results in fig 8 are consistent with the earlier findings of this study indeed the demc with es initial point selection always needed fewer iterations to converge to the posterior distribution the search capabilities of the two algorithms are shown in fig 9 this figure presents the logarithmic values of the likelihood function sampled by both the demc blue dots and the demc with es initial point selection red dots in case 2 the likelihood function can be used to express the degree of closeness between the observed and calculated values the larger the likelihood function the closer are the observed and calculated values when using multi chain mcmc the likelihood function of each generation has more than one value and therefore the mean value is calculated and used to represent the whole fig 9 shows that the likelihood function of the demc with es initial point selection is not only higher than that of the demc at the beginning but is also generally higher in the later stages of iteration this indicates that the search efficiency of the whole iterative process can be improved by selecting the initial point through the es algorithm the previous results show that the proposed combination algorithm has faster convergence rate and higher search efficiency however these improvements are meaningless if the demc with es initial point selection does not approximate the target distribution correctly fig 10 and fig 11 show plots of the posterior probability distributions of the unknown parameters obtained from the demc blue dashed lines and the demc with es initial point selection red lines in the first two cases the true values of the unknown parameters are separately indicated by a black vertical solid line the approximate posterior probability distributions of both algorithms are very similar and are well concentrated near the true values this implies that the demc with es initial point selection successfully approximates the target distribution in addition the posterior distribution peak estimated by the proposed method is closer to the true value which is less obvious in case 1 but more obvious in case 2 in practice the true values of the unknown parameters cannot be known it is impossible to verify the accuracy of inversion by comparing the true values with the identification results therefore additional observed data were provided to solve this problem these data were the observed concentrations of the five observation wells during the test period the identification results were brought into the original model and the simulation data were compared with the additional observed data as shown in fig 12 the closer the simulation data are to the additional observed data the more accurate the identification results fig 12 shows a fitted graph of the observed and simulation data the red square represents the demc and the blue diamond represents the demc with es initial point selection the closer the marker is to the line y x the closer the simulation data are to the observed data fig 12 clearly shows that the blue mark is closer to the line y x which indicates that the identification results of the demc with es initial point selection are better this is even more obvious in fig 12 b the correlation coefficient and the relative errors of the observed and simulation data were also calculated in case 1 the difference between the two algorithms was not obvious with values of 0 9959 1 70 and 0 9982 1 40 respectively in case 2 the difference is more obvious with values of 0 9552 6 73 and 0 9901 3 07 respectively it can be concluded that the proposed method can improve the accuracy more significantly in case 2 this implies that the proposed method will play a greater role at higher problem dimension moreover it significantly reduced computing time to apply the aksm for the gsci problem in the demc algorithm 4000 iterations were demanded in case 1 and every iteration required 20 calls of the original model to calculate the outputs the original model for case 1 needed about 67 h of cpu time to finish 80 000 simulations on the workstation mentioned earlier whereas the aksm took about two hours to construct and run the model the time savings are obvious and more so in case 2 the times taken were 1111 h in the original model and 5 h including the running time and building time of the model in the surrogate respectively however although the fidelity of the surrogate model output was close to that of the simulation model the error between the aksm and the original models may have a slight impact on the results this is also a worthwhile problem but it is not within the scope of this paper and will be studied in future research to better illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed combination algorithm case 3 which is a case with higher dimension is established fig 13 show plots of the posterior probability distributions of release intensity in the first three stress periods obtained from the demc blue dashed lines and the demc with es initial point selection red lines in case 3 the results show that there is no significant difference between the posterior distributions obtained by the two algorithms the peak of a posteriori probability distribution indicates that the probability of the parameters falling near it is the largest it can be seen from the figure that the peak of the posterior probability distribution obtained by the combination algorithm is closer to the true value and the corresponding peak is more prominent this implies that the combination algorithm accumulates more samples near the true value and made more exploration around here fig 14 and fig 15 shows that the posterior mean and variances of conductivity field is obtained from different algorithms it can be seen from the fig 14 that the conductivity fields obtained by the two algorithms are very close to the real conductivity fields through the correlation coefficient r2 it can be further seen that the posterior mean conductivity obtained by the combination algorithm is closer to the real one the variance diagram obtained by the two algorithms can be seen from fig 15 the variance distribution of the two algorithms is similar indicating that the posterior distribution of the two algorithms is similar moreover the variance of both algorithms is at a low level and the variance of the combination algorithm is relatively small it shows that the two algorithms are convergent and the ensemble obtained by the combination algorithm is more concentrated these results are very encouraging which shows that the combination algorithm has higher accuracy but these cannot explain the efficiency of the algorithm so we launched a further study fig 16 shows the iterative trace of rmse between the observed and calculated values the smaller the rmse is the smaller the error between the observed value and the calculated value is the better the fitting effect is it can be seen from the figure that the rmse of the combination algorithm decreases sharply at the beginning of the iteration and decreases to below 0 90 at about 900 iterations while the rmse of the demc algorithm needs 18 000 iterations to reach about 0 90 in the later stage of iteration the rmse of demc algorithm is about 0 87 while the rmse of combination algorithm is about 0 46 therefore it can be seen that the combined algorithm has higher efficiency than the demc algorithm fig 17 show the logarithmic values of the likelihood function sampled by both the demc blue dots and the demc with es initial point selection red dots in case 3 in fig 17 we can observe the same situation as fig 9 it can be seen that the likelihood function value of the combined algorithm is always higher than that of the demc algorithm moreover this situation is more obvious in fig 17 than in fig 9 it also shows that the proposed combination algorithm will play a more significant role with the increase of dimension the three common methods used for gcsi are the so srs and kf methods in past research one of these methods was often used however each method has its own limitations recently researchers have used some new approaches to break through these limitations for example in the so method the uncertainty was assumed and the inversion was carried out li et al 2020 the mcmc algorithm has been improved to accelerate its convergence speed on high dimensional problems zhang et al 2020 in the kf method the normal score has been used to transform a non gaussian distribution into a gaussian distribution xu and jaime gomez hernandez 2018 this study attempts to overcome the limitations of the methods themselves from another point of view through the joint use of different methods therefore the es and demc algorithms were combined in this study to identify groundwater pollution sources and good results were obtained hopefully more researchers will try to combine different methods in the future to produce more valuable combinations in this paper es algorithm and demc algorithm are combined to get a new algorithm and the proposed algorithm is applied in different cases which has achieved good results it proves that the proposed method has good applicability and can be used in many cases however the combination of this paper only takes the identification results of es algorithm as the initial points of the demc algorithm and the connection between the algorithms is not close enough if we can make the algorithms more closely combined we may achieve better results and hope that we can continue to make efforts in this aspect in the future research 5 conclusions this study combined the es and demc algorithms to simultaneously recognize source properties and simulation model parameters in groundwater contamination the es algorithm was used to select the initial point to better illustrate the advantages of the es algorithm it was compared with the ha then the identification results of the es algorithm were used as the initial point of the demc algorithm the updating formula was adjusted by introducing information about the optimal chain to improve the efficiency of the demc algorithm this gave the algorithm faster convergence and higher identification accuracy to improve overall computational efficiency an iterative updating strategy was used to develop an adaptive kriging surrogate model different hypothetical cases were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed combination algorithm these cases represented different levels of complexity case 2 had more complexity and higher dimensionality than case 1 the comparison of the es and ha shows that the es can provide better initial points in a shorter time thus improving inversion efficiency the identification results show that the proposed combination algorithm has not only faster convergence but also higher accuracy these improvements are more evident in case 2 and case 3 this implies that the proposed method will play a greater role with increasing problem complexity the selection of initial points the initial estimation of parameters has an important influence on the efficiency of the algorithm in the previous research hou et al 2021 li et al 2021 homotopy algorithm and optimization algorithm are combined to improve the initial point gradually but it is very time consuming to solve the optimization model many times therefore the es algorithm is proposed to select the initial point which not only greatly reduces the calculation time but also provides the initial point closer to the true value and es is not limited by its gaussian distribution because it only serves as the initial value mcmc algorithm has low search efficiency in high dimension problems zhang et al 2020 therefore this paper improves the multi chain mcmc algorithm demc which can improve the updating formula by using the information of the optimal chain and improve the search

4171,detecting the hydrological responses of overburden aquifers to mining disturbance is significant in groundwater resource protection and mining safety thus an effective and economical method of tracking such responses is necessary this paper uses time series analysis and groundwater tidal response analysis to identify and quantify the hydrological responses associated with longwall mining including changes in water level specific storage ss and the barometric effect before mining disturbance these factors remains stable however under mining disturbance the water level declines by 2 5 40 m ss decreases by 1 2 orders of magnitude and the barometric effect declines one possibility is that the production of horizontal or vertical fractures by mining disturbance leads to hydrological responses in overburden aquifers another possible mechanism is the redistribution of particles in the aquifer by waves from mining induced seismicity which changes the water level ss and barometric effect after mining disturbance the recoveries in water level ss and the barometric effect are influenced by the degree of mining disturbance water inflow or runoff recharge the effective identification and interpretation of hydrological responses to mining disturbance improve our understanding of the impact that mining has on aquifer systems keywords hydrological response time series analysis groundwater tidal response mining disturbance 1 introduction longwall mining is a widely used coal extraction method around the world because of its efficiency safety and high extraction rate however it often leads to deformation movement and destruction in overburden aquifers zhang et al 2016 ju et al 2017 the most common concern is the hydrological response of overburden aquifers to mining activity which may involve water loss water inrush disasters and environmental damage izadi et al 2011 adhikary and guo 2014 wang et al 2016 zhu et al 2020 the hydrological response indicates the groundwater in aquifer respond to natural or human activity e g mining activities including changes of groundwater level aquifer parameter hydraulic connection and hydrochemistry shi et al 2021 qu et al 2020c xu et al 2021 in addition groundwater microdynamics such as the groundwater barometric effect which is an important indicator of the hydrological responses of an aquifer wang et al 1988 doan et al 2006 generally the hydrological characteristics of overburden aquifers change according to the mining process mayne and poulos 1999 clayton and heymann 2001 sui et al 2015 meng et al 2016 therefore researchers often divide an overburden aquifer into three zones in the vertical direction a constrained zone fractured zone and caved zone fig 1 karacan and goodman 2009 david et al 2017 on this basis mining disturbance lead to a hydrological response in the overburden aquifer which complicates the quantitative study of water resources and the prevention of coalfield water disasters however there are few effective methods for detecting the hydrological responses of overburden aquifers to longwall mining disturbance institute of material minerals and mining immm 2005 mcnally and evans 2007 feng et al 2007 accordingly an alternative method is needed in hydrology time series analysis and groundwater tidal response monitoring are economical passive tools for investigating the hydrological changes of aquifer systems since the 20th century time series analyses have been widely used to provide valuable information on hydrological changes in complex fractured and karstic aquifers larocque et al 1998 zhang and lόpez 2019 qu et al 2020c in the field of earthquake hydrology tidal responses have been reported to reflect continuous changes in aquifer parameters igarashi and wakita 1991 cutillo and bredehoeft 2011 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 although time series analysis and groundwater tidal response monitoring have used in coal mine hydrogeology in previous studies qu et al 2020b qu et al 2020c zhang and lόpez 2019 these studies focused on proposal of methodology and only one panel as an example to investigate a type of hydrological response by contrast this study pay attention to the mechanism study of different hydrological responses groundwater level aquifer parameter and barometric effect using multiple methods tidal method and time series analysis this paper focused on two boreholes j6 and j7 located above two panels in ningtiaota coalfield northwest china based on time series analysis and groundwater tidal responses the aims were to 1 detect the hydrological response caused by longwall mining and 2 investigate its regularity and controlling mechanism the findings provide a better understanding of the impacts that mining has on aquifer systems they can be used to inform further groundwater management in the study area as well as in most other coalfields in northwest china 2 geological setting and mining activity the ningtiaota coalfield is located in yulin city shaanxi province china fig 2 the study area has a semi arid continental climate with an annual average temperature of 8 6 c according to observational data from the weather station the annual average precipitation is 434 1 mm fig 5 while annual average evaporation is 1712 0 mm there are no large faults or magmatic rocks in the area yao and xia 2007 the four main aquifers corresponding to different strata in the coalfield are the jurassic yan an group j2y sandstone fractured aquifer the zhiluo group j2z sandstone fractured aquifer the quaternary pleistocene salawusu group q3s alluvial aquifers and the holocene eolian sand q4 eol pore aquifer li et al 2008 yang et al 2015 according to the pumping and draining tests conducted in the coalfield the hydraulic conductivity and specific capacity of the jurassic zhiluo group j2z sandstone aquifer is 0 05 2 11 m d and 0 02 0 03 l s m but hydraulic conductivity and specific storage of the jurassic yan an group j2y sandstone aquifer is just 0 00027 0 0003 m d and 0 000065 0 00058 l s m indicating poor permeability and water yield the main mined coal seam is 2 2 which is in the j2y group aquitards are present consisting of the baode group n2b red clay aquitard and the lishi group q2l loess aquitard qu et al 2020b the locations of the j2z sandstone aquifer at boreholes j6 and j7 were about 55 100 m and 35 85 m higher respectively than those of the main coal seam fig 2 the ningtiaota coalfield is 71 2 km2 in area and underground coal mines have been operating there for 10 years there are many long term monitoring boreholes in the coalfield boreholes j6 screened in the j2z aquifer j7 screened in the j2z aquifer and sk8 screened in the j2y aquifer were used in this study borehole j6 is located directly above panel s12003 which has a mining height of 4 2 m fig 3 this was undermined from 2017 to 2018 in a south to north direction and the working face passed borehole j6 on 10th may 2018 in addition borehole j6 neighbors panel s12002 which was undermined from 2019 to 2020 in a south to north direction fig 3 and the working face passed the eastern side of j6 on 20th february 2020 the phase and schedule of mining activity in different panels are shown in fig 4 borehole j7 is located directly above panel s1229 which has a mining height of 8 9 m and was undermined from 2016 to 2017 in an east to west direction and the working face passed j7 on 10th august 2017 borehole sk8 was used for comparison and is located at the southern boundary of the study area far from any panels or mining activity 3 methodology 3 1 borehole observations data on groundwater level and barometric pressure were obtained from pressure transducers installed in three observation wells hereafter called boreholes that were drilled in 2012 j6 j7 and sk8 in fig 2 boreholes j6 and j7 had a well radius of 70 mm and open hole depths of 215 m and 203 28 m respectively and penetrated to the j2y aquifer fig 2 boreholes j6 and j7 were screened in the j2z aquifer with casing pipe depths including screened sections of 151 4 m and 147 88 m respectively hence the water levels in the boreholes mainly represented that of j2z aquifer boreholes j6 j7 and sk8 were equipped with absolute pressure gauges solinst levellogger solinst canada ltd to observe dynamic variations in groundwater level borehole sk8 was also equipped with a solinst barologger to observe barometric pressures fig 2 both the sampling interval for water level and barometric pressure data are hour values we obtained a time series of barometric pressure covering the whole study period and water levels in borehole j6 from 2017 to 2020 and borehole sk8 from 2016 to 2020 however we could only obtain a water level time series from borehole j7 for the period 2016 october 2017 because mining activity in panel s1229 led to movement and cracking of the formation fig 5 a and b and deformation of the borehole fig 5c in addition j7 had missing data from 7 to 20 april 2017 due to equipment malfunction 3 2 time series analysis in general there are two types of time series analysis univariate and multivariate modeling which are selected according to the number of variables sahu et al 2009 in this study autocorrelation analysis univariate modeling angelini 1997 and coherence analysis multivariate modeling chatfield 2000 were used to detect the hydrological responses of the overburden aquifer to mining disturbance 3 2 1 autocorrelation analysis a correlogram c k is a plot of autocorrelation versus a lag time k lee and lee 2000 all the autocorrelations must lie within the range of 1 1 the autocorrelation coefficient r k is calculated by equation 1 chatfield 1980 1 r k c k c 0 c k 1 n t 1 n k x t x x t k x here n is the number of sample points x is a single event and x is the mean in autocorrelation analysis different autocorrelation functions r k are associated with different lag times k to give useful information about memory effects in the system i e the duration of the influence of an event angelini 1997 and the response time tr the lag time when r k decreases from 1 to 0 sahu 2004 3 2 2 coherence analysis the coherence function coxy f represents the relationship between two time series in terms of frequency jenkins and watts 1968 and can indicate whether changes in the output series correspond to the same type of changes in the input series it is defined as larocque et al 1998 2 c o x y f s x y f s x f s y f here sx f sy f and sxy f are spectral density functions and f is frequency cycles per day cpd the value of coxy f varies between 0 and 1 where 0 indicates two independent time series and 1 indicates two dependent series zhang and lόpez 2019 3 3 estimation of specific storage an artesian well may respond to earth tide and barometric pressure fluctuations at different time scales bredehoeft 1967 and the aquifer properties could be inferred by coupling the tidal and barometric pressure fluctuations and groundwater flow caused by the deformation on this basis the temporal variation of the properties of an aquifer could be inferred from the long term monitoring of the level of the well water elkhoury et al 2006 xue et al 2013 the in situ and temporal variation of aquifer properties such as the porosity φ compressibility β and specific storage ss could be inferred by combing the barometric pressure and tidal response igarashi and wakita 1991 3 β l e 1 l e 3 2 ρ g a s 1 ν β s 4 φ β β s 1 b b β f β s 5 s s ρ g α β 1 2 α 1 2 ν 3 1 ν ρ g φ β f β s here le is loading efficiency and b is skempton coefficient as is areal strain sensitivity ρ is the density of water ν is poisson s ratio βs is the solids compressibility van der kamp and gale 1983 and βf is the water compressibility cutillo and bredehoeft 2011 in this study the ss was estimated by eq 3 5 using the estimated process of qu et al 2020a 4 results 4 1 changes in water level in this study the locations of boreholes j6 or j7 were set as the original points as shown in fig 6 a negative value of mining distance along the mining direction represents the distance between the working face and the borehole before the face has passed the borehole while a positive value represents the distance after the working face has passed the borehole as fig 6a shows a gradual decline in water level was observed before april 2018 after april 2018 the water level in j6 began to show an abnormal change with the mining distance about 227 m indicating that the influential scope of s12003 panel is around 227 m when the mining distance of s12003 reached 0 m i e subjacent to the location of j6 decline of water level reached 20 m then the water level began to recover after the working face of s12003 passed j6 taking 80 days to recover to the original level afterward another panel s12002 located near s12003 began to be worked from 2019 and passed the eastern side of j6 on february 24th 2020 fig 3 when the mining distance of s12002 reached 0 m i e lateral to j6 and about 150 m far away from j6 fig 6b the water level decreased by 2 5 m indicating that the influential scope of s12002 panel is around 150 m and then water level remained stable without recovering as shown in fig 6c the water level in borehole j7 showed a gradual change before june 2017 after june 2017 the water level in j7 began to show a sharp change with the mining distance about 401 m indicating that the influential scope of s1229 panel is around 401 m when the mining distance of s1229 reached 0 m i e subjacent to j7 decline of water level reached 40 m then the water level began to recover after the working face passed j7 in contrast the water level in borehole sk8 which was more than 2 km away from the three panels remained stable without any large fluctuations throughout the study period indicating that j6 and j7 were disturbed by mining activity based on in situ observation data the changes in water level induced by different panels were qualitatively analyzed to explore and quantify the changes in water level time series analysis was conducted in this study the water level time series was divided into three stages pre during and post disturbance fig 6 the lengths of time and amounts of data were the same for each stage which was helpful in identifying the hydrological response of the overburden aquifer to identify the changes in water level in boreholes j6 and j7 induced by mining disturbance from panels s12003 s12002 and s1229 the water level time series of j6 and j7 were used in autocorrelation analysis at the pre disturbance stage the auto correlogram of water levels in j6 and j7 displays slow decays along with an increased lag time fig 7 this represents a strong linear inter relationship and repetitive behavior of the variable lee and lee 2000 indicating an influence of periodic factors e g barometric pressure at the stage of in disturbance the three auto correlograms quickly decrease to 0 fig 7 this indicates that the influence of the periodic factors declined in other words the response of water level to barometric pressure i e barometric effect doan et al 2006 may have been influenced by mining disturbance thus autocorrelation analysis could effectively identify the hydrological responses to disturbance at the post disturbance stage the auto correlogram indicated that there was a recovery in the water level in borehole j6 indicating a recovery in the linear inter relationship and repetition behavior of the groundwater according to the autocorrelation analysis the barometric effect on groundwater may be influenced by mining disturbance fig 7 in fact other periodic force such as earth tide shares similar frequency band in the semi diurnal and diurnal band but we just discuss the barometric effect in this study the reason is that the barometric effect is widespread and general by contrast the groundwater level in some boreholes sometimes have little or no response to earth tides qu et al 2020c in conclusion the discussion of barometric effect is of universality and applicability thus we employed coherence analysis between water level and barometric pressure on this basis coherence analysis was used to directly quantify and explore the changes in the barometric effect under mining disturbance as shown in fig 8 the changes in the coherence function cb between water level and barometric pressure for pre in and post disturbance stages were determined in hydrology frequencies of 1 cpd and 2 cpd i e frequencies of the k1 and s2 constituents doan et al 2006 are the main frequencies of barometric pressure loading xue et al 2016 qu et al 2020b so the changes in the coherence function at these two frequencies were focused on at the pre disturbance stage high cb values were observed in boreholes j6 and j7 at frequencies of 1 cpd and 2 cpd cb 0 7 indicating a strong barometric effect on the groundwater in contrast the cb value in j6 and j7 showed obvious decreases at the in disturbance stage indicating that the barometric effect declined fig 8 at the post disturbance stage the cb in j6 recovered indicating a recovery of the barometric effect these findings are consistent with the results of the autocorrelation analysis described above 4 2 changes in specific storage ss in addition to water levels and barometric effects change in the ss is another important indicator however the continuous in situ measurement of ss is difficult and challenging booth 2002 sui et al 2015 in this case monitoring of the groundwater tidal response is an effective and passive way to achieve the continuous in situ measurement of ss qu et al 2020a and quantify the hydrological responses of overburden aquifers to mining activities as fig 9 shows the ss values in boreholes j6 j7 and sk8 had an order of magnitude of 10 5 m 1 before mining disturbance however the ss of j6 began to decrease after april 2018 when the mining distance of s12003 reached 0 m i e subjacent to j6 the ss of j6 ranged from approximately 2 10 5 to 2 10 7 m 1 with a two order of magnitude decrease then ss began to recover after the working face of s12003 passed j6 recovering to its previous level in about 80 days afterward the ss of j6 began to show an obvious decrease after february 2020 fig 9b when the mining distance of s12002 reached 0 m i e lateral to j6 the values of ss ranged from 2 10 5 to 4 10 6 m 1 a decrease of less than one order of magnitude then ss recovered to its previous level fig 9b as shown in fig 9c the ss of borehole j7 began to decrease after june 2017 when the mining distance of s1229 reached 0 m i e subjacent to j7 ss did not decrease to a minimum but continued to decrease to 2 10 7 m 1 a decrease of more than two orders of magnitude 5 discussion the above results indicate that time series analysis and groundwater tidal response analysis can effectively identify the hydrological responses of overburden aquifers to mining disturbance on this basis the mechanisms of hydrological responses are discussed which is beneficial in understanding how overburden aquifers are affected by mining disturbance 5 1 mechanism of change in water level the time series of water level data from boreholes j6 j7 and sk8 were analyzed from 2016 to 2020 stable water levels or slow declines were observed in j6 j7 and sk8 at the pre disturbance stage fig 6 after april 2018 the water level in j6 began to show an obvious decline indicating an abnormal disturbance mining of panel s12003 after mining disturbance the water level in j6 recovered to its previous level in about 80 days however we found that the water level of j6 showed rapid rise above its initial level before returning to its initial level the possible reason is that the fractures at the bottom of borehole is caused by instantaneous extrusion closure associated with the recovery of aquifer property qian and xu 2019 in contrast as the working face of s12002 gradually approached the location lateral to j6 the water level did not show any decrease before the working face passed it fig 6b the water level in borehole j6 began to decrease by 2 5 m on the other hand the decline of water level induced by panel s12002 was 17 5 m less than that induced by s12003 an approximate difference of 87 5 fig 6a and b indicating that s12002 caused less disturbance to j6 at the post disturbance stage the water level and ss in borehole j6 after disturbance by panel s12003 both recovered to their initial levels however the water level in j6 after disturbance by s12002 remained stable without recovery while ss recovered to its initial level fig 9b this indicates that there was another factor influencing the water level after disturbance by s12002 besides changes of aquifer parameters the water in overburden aquifer also could be removed by the pumping of mine drainage pump house in tunnel during mining process qu et al 2020c according to water inflow data from panels s12002 and s12003 table 1 s12003 had near zero water inflow over the whole period therefore the decline of water level in j6 induced by s12003 was mainly determined by the ss in contrast the water inflow in s12002 was obviously greater than that in s12003 so the decline of water level in s12002 was not only influenced by the aquifer parameter but also by mine drainage qu et al 2020c thus at the post disturbance stage panel s12002 ss recovered but the water level did not indicating that the water level in j6 was constantly affected by mine drainage from panel s12002 the water level in borehole j7 began to show an instantaneous decline after july 2017 fig 6c indicative of abnormal disturbance mining disturbance from panel s1229 additionally the greatest the decline of water level in j7 induced by panel s1229 was 40 m which was double that induced in j6 by panel s12003 this indicates that the disturbance from s1229 was so strong that the decline of water level in j7 was much larger than that in j6 however when the working face of s1229 passed j7 the water level began to recover but ss did not this indicates that recovery of the water level in borehole j7 was not only decided by ss but possibly also by recharge from other areas according to the water table contour and groundwater flow direction fig 2 borehole j7 was located in a discharge area and received runoff recharge from a recharge area west of the study area furthermore the greater decline of water level induced by mining disturbance could lead to a lower water table contour around j7 so it could receive recharge and recover its water level during this period based on the in situ water level observations described above autocorrelations of hourly water levels in boreholes j6 and j7 were calculated to compare the hydrological characteristics of the pre in and post disturbance stages the memory effect and response time tr are two common indicators used to interpret the autocorrelation of signals firstly if an event has a long term memory effect such as barometric pressure loading the slope of the autocorrelation function decreases slowly while in the case of an event with a short memory effect the slope decreases very rapidly with increasing lag time lee and lee 2000 secondly if an event has a long tr the system has a high storage capacity sahu et al 2009 in this study the memory effect was quantified by fitting the rate of decrease of the autocorrelation function fig 10 it is a logarithmic law of the form r k a ln k b where a represents the speed at which information is lost and b is a parameter related to the amplitude of the correlation for a unit lag time k 1 day massei et al 2006 parameter a is a key parameter controlling the rate of decrease of the autocorrelation function and the memory effect the results of a at different stages of mining disturbance are summarized in table 2 at the pre disturbance stage of the three panels the auto correlograms of water levels influenced by panels s12003 s12002 and s1229 show slow rates of decrease a 0 014 0 032 and 0 004 respectively along with an increased lag time fig 7 these show long memory effects and tr values indicating a strong barometric effect and high storage capacity however at the in disturbance stage the auto correlograms displayed rapid rates of decrease a 0 29 0 268 and 0 216 respectively along with increased lag times fig 7 these show a decreased memory effect and tr value indicating a weaker barometric effect and lower storage capacity this is consistent with the decreases of ss in boreholes j6 and j7 fig 9 a possible reason is that mining disturbance influenced the barometric effect which is discussed in the coherence analysis below at the post disturbance stage the auto correlograms of water levels under the influence of panels s12003 and s12002 recovered fig 7 including the values of a and tr indicating recoveries in the barometric effect and storage capacity the recovery of storage capacity derived from the autocorrelation is consistent with the temporal evolution in ss described above fig 9 to investigate whether mining disturbance affects the barometric effect coherence analyses between water level and barometric pressure were conducted for the pre in and post disturbance periods above all we can find that the coherence function between groundwater level and barometric pressure in j6 and j7 are different the possible reason is that the confinement of every borehole is different because of different borehole construction zhang et al 2021 and the barometric effect is related to confinement thus different borehole construction fig 3 between j6 and j7 will lead to this difference which is a common phenomenon on this basis at the pre disturbance stage of the three panels high cb values at frequencies of 1 cpd and 2 cpd were observed between barometric pressure and water level fig 8 however the cb decreased at the in disturbance stage indicating a weaker barometric effect fig 8 the possible reason is that a large decline in water level induced by mining disturbance affected the pore pressure booth 2007 david et al 2017 which may have disturbed the transmission of strain induced by barometric pressure consequently the barometric effect on groundwater may decline at the post disturbance stage the cb value in borehole j6 recovered fig 8a and b which may be caused by recovery in ss fig 9a and b 5 2 mechanism of change in the specific storage in this study we determined the temporal changes in specific storage ss during mining periods fig 9 variation in ss values can play an important role in understanding the hydrological responses of aquifer systems to mining activities our study showed that parameter ss was affected by mining disturbance with more significant disturbance associated with the approaching of a working face as shown in fig 9 the changes of ss values in boreholes j6 and j7 showed obvious differences during mining disturbance from panels s12003 s12002 and s1229 after april 2018 the ss values in j6 approximately ranged from 2 10 5 to 2 10 7 m 1 with a two order of magnitude decrease during disturbance from panel s12003 after february 2020 the ss values in j6 approximately ranged from 2 10 5 to 4 10 6 m 1 with a less than one order of magnitude decrease during disturbance from s12002 in contrast the ss values in j7 approximately ranged from 2 5 10 5 to 1 10 7 m 1 with a greater than two orders of magnitude decrease during disturbance from s1229 it is obvious that the impacts of the panel working faces on the ss values in boreholes j6 and j7 followed the order of s1229 s12003 s12002 and were possibly influenced by the degree of disturbance of the different panels additionally the values of ss began to increase after the working faces of panels s12003 and s12002 passed borehole j6 and recovered to their initial values fig 9a and b in contrast the ss values in j7 still decreased without recovery even after the s1229 working face was about 40 m past the borehole fig 9c meanwhile strong disturbance by panel s1229 led to crack formation and borehole deformation fig 5 thus we deduced that the differences in the recovery processes were also influenced by the degree of disturbance caused by the different panels based on the empirical formula for the height of the water flow fractured zone including the fractured zone and caved zone li 2016 6 h l 100 m 1 6 m 3 6 5 6 here hl is the height of the water flow fractured zone and σm is the thickness of the coal seam which was 4 2 m for panel s12003 and 8 9 m for panel s1229 it has been calculated that the hl of s12003 was 46 30 m and that of s1229 was 55 49 m as mentioned above the groundwater levels in boreholes j6 and j7 represented those of the jurassic zhiluo group j2z sandstone aquifer so the disturbance by panel s1229 was greater than that of s12003 and at the locations above these panels the j2z aquifer was in fractured and constrained zones respectively in the constrained zone the decreases in water level and ss in borehole j6 were expected to be the result of stress changes compression of strata which can easily produce horizontal fractures but not vertical ones fig 1 mills 2012 matetic and trevits 1991 the groundwater flow in the constrained zone above panel s12003 was horizontal and had difficulty entering into mining tunnels fig 1 so the water inflow of panel s12003 was close to zero table 1 however the fractured zone contained connected vertical fractures fig 1 booth 2002 so the decline in water level was greatest in borehole j7 according to cheng et al 2017 and zhao et al 2018 in the process of mining the strata of the constrained zone undergo a process of elastic plastic deformation while the fractured zone undergoes deformation yielding and cracking thus there is less destruction of the strata in the constrained zone than that in the fractured zone elastic deformation may occur and the maximum effective stress will not reach the yield point qu et al 2020a thus the aquifer parameter in the constrained zone can recover in response to stress changes relaxation of strata in contrast the formation cracking and deformation of borehole j7 prove that there was damage in the fractured zone so that the overburden properties in the fractured zone had difficulty in completely recovering liu and elsworth 1997 as for panel s12002 which neighbored s12003 and passed the location lateral to borehole j6 fig 3 the overburden aquifers were neither in fractured nor constrained zones this makes it difficult to produce horizontal or vertical fractures such that the aquifer parameter could easily recover and the disturbance from panel s12002 was the least from the above it can be seen that the degree of disturbance caused by different panels followed the order of s1229 s12003 s12002 which is consistent with the changes in water level and ss according to the above results the changes in water level and ss showed a strong relationship in boreholes j6 and j7 under disturbance from panels s12003 and s1229 respectively according to principle of effective stress terzaghi 1943 7 σ σ ρ here σ is applied stress σ is effective stress and p is pore pressure when the pore pressure decreases fig 6a c and the applied barometric pressure is relatively constant fig 6d the effective stress will increase and the overburden strata will compress leading to a decrease in ss in contrast when the working face of panel s12002 approached borehole j6 the value of ss showed a gradual decrease fig 9b however the water level did not fig 6b when the working face of s12002 passed j6 and the ss value was the lowest the water level in the borehole began to decrease the process was different from those occurring in boreholes j6 and j7 under disturbance from panels s12003 and s1229 as discussed above the disturbance from s12002 was the smallest so it did not have much potential to produce horizontal or vertical fractures however the waves associated with mining induced seismicity from panel s12002 may have led to a redistribution of some of the particles in the aquifer liu and manga 2009 and a small decrease in ss however it did not induce an obvious decline in water level only when ss continues to decrease to a certain value due to disturbance will the water level show a decline thus there was a time lag between the variations in ss and water level because of the lower degree of mining disturbance caused by panel s12002 in conclusion the process of disturbance by panel s12002 was different from those of s12003 and s1229 the degree of disturbance caused by the three panels followed the order of s1229 s12003 s12002 on this basis the changes in water level and ss induced by s12003 and s1229 were synchronous and followed the principle of effective stress in contrast the change in water level induced by panel s12002 lagged behind the change in ss due to the redistribution of partial particles 5 3 relationships between hydrological responses the hydrological responses identified above being the decline in water level h response time of autocorrelation tr coherence between water level and barometric pressure cb and specific storage ss showed certain relationships associated with mining the quantitative relationships between these variables are important in revealing the possible mechanisms controlling the hydrological responses for this purpose the correlation coefficients r between these factors were calculated by spss 19 0 table 3 factors tr and ss were positively correlated r 0 794 indicating that both tr and ss reflect the storage capacity of aquifers which is consistent with the results above in addition cb and ss were positively correlated r 0 821 indicating that the barometric effect was influenced by the storage capacity of the aquifers the reason is that h was negatively correlated with ss r 0 706 indicating that a decrease in ss may lead to increased h meanwhile an increase in h could induce a decrease in pore pressure causing the transmission of strain induced by barometric pressure to be disturbed which may be reflected by the negative correlation between h and cb r 0 86 consequently cb was positively correlated with ss although all the correlations discussed above are significant at the 0 05 or 0 1 levels the correlation coefficient between h and ss was lowest r 0 706 table 3 the reason is that h was not only controlled by ss but was also influenced by mine drainage or recharge the quantitative relationships found between different hydrological responses are consistent with the results above 6 conclusions in this paper we used the method of the time series analysis and groundwater tidal responses to identify changes in water level specific storage ss and the barometric effect in boreholes j6 and j7 in relation to the longwall mining of panels s12003 s12002 and s1229 the main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 when boreholes j6 and j7 under mining disturbance of panels 12003 s12002 and s1229 the water level declined by 2 5 40 m ss decreased by 1 2 orders of magnitude and the barometric effect declined 2 the degree of disturbance caused by the three panels followed the order of s1229 s12003 s12002 on this basis the changes in water level and ss induced by s12003 and s1229 were synchronous due to the production of horizontal or vertical fractures by mining disturbance in contrast the change in water level induced by panel s12002 lagged behind the change in ss due to the redistribution of partial particles by waves associated with mining induced seismicity 3 after mining disturbance the water level ss and the barometric effect in j6 and j7 showed different recovery process we found that the degree of mining disturbance water inflow or runoff recharge were controlling factors influencing recovery process the results of this study could enhance our understanding of the mining induced hydrological responses in an overburden aquifer and could have

4171,detecting the hydrological responses of overburden aquifers to mining disturbance is significant in groundwater resource protection and mining safety thus an effective and economical method of tracking such responses is necessary this paper uses time series analysis and groundwater tidal response analysis to identify and quantify the hydrological responses associated with longwall mining including changes in water level specific storage ss and the barometric effect before mining disturbance these factors remains stable however under mining disturbance the water level declines by 2 5 40 m ss decreases by 1 2 orders of magnitude and the barometric effect declines one possibility is that the production of horizontal or vertical fractures by mining disturbance leads to hydrological responses in overburden aquifers another possible mechanism is the redistribution of particles in the aquifer by waves from mining induced seismicity which changes the water level ss and barometric effect after mining disturbance the recoveries in water level ss and the barometric effect are influenced by the degree of mining disturbance water inflow or runoff recharge the effective identification and interpretation of hydrological responses to mining disturbance improve our understanding of the impact that mining has on aquifer systems keywords hydrological response time series analysis groundwater tidal response mining disturbance 1 introduction longwall mining is a widely used coal extraction method around the world because of its efficiency safety and high extraction rate however it often leads to deformation movement and destruction in overburden aquifers zhang et al 2016 ju et al 2017 the most common concern is the hydrological response of overburden aquifers to mining activity which may involve water loss water inrush disasters and environmental damage izadi et al 2011 adhikary and guo 2014 wang et al 2016 zhu et al 2020 the hydrological response indicates the groundwater in aquifer respond to natural or human activity e g mining activities including changes of groundwater level aquifer parameter hydraulic connection and hydrochemistry shi et al 2021 qu et al 2020c xu et al 2021 in addition groundwater microdynamics such as the groundwater barometric effect which is an important indicator of the hydrological responses of an aquifer wang et al 1988 doan et al 2006 generally the hydrological characteristics of overburden aquifers change according to the mining process mayne and poulos 1999 clayton and heymann 2001 sui et al 2015 meng et al 2016 therefore researchers often divide an overburden aquifer into three zones in the vertical direction a constrained zone fractured zone and caved zone fig 1 karacan and goodman 2009 david et al 2017 on this basis mining disturbance lead to a hydrological response in the overburden aquifer which complicates the quantitative study of water resources and the prevention of coalfield water disasters however there are few effective methods for detecting the hydrological responses of overburden aquifers to longwall mining disturbance institute of material minerals and mining immm 2005 mcnally and evans 2007 feng et al 2007 accordingly an alternative method is needed in hydrology time series analysis and groundwater tidal response monitoring are economical passive tools for investigating the hydrological changes of aquifer systems since the 20th century time series analyses have been widely used to provide valuable information on hydrological changes in complex fractured and karstic aquifers larocque et al 1998 zhang and lόpez 2019 qu et al 2020c in the field of earthquake hydrology tidal responses have been reported to reflect continuous changes in aquifer parameters igarashi and wakita 1991 cutillo and bredehoeft 2011 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 although time series analysis and groundwater tidal response monitoring have used in coal mine hydrogeology in previous studies qu et al 2020b qu et al 2020c zhang and lόpez 2019 these studies focused on proposal of methodology and only one panel as an example to investigate a type of hydrological response by contrast this study pay attention to the mechanism study of different hydrological responses groundwater level aquifer parameter and barometric effect using multiple methods tidal method and time series analysis this paper focused on two boreholes j6 and j7 located above two panels in ningtiaota coalfield northwest china based on time series analysis and groundwater tidal responses the aims were to 1 detect the hydrological response caused by longwall mining and 2 investigate its regularity and controlling mechanism the findings provide a better understanding of the impacts that mining has on aquifer systems they can be used to inform further groundwater management in the study area as well as in most other coalfields in northwest china 2 geological setting and mining activity the ningtiaota coalfield is located in yulin city shaanxi province china fig 2 the study area has a semi arid continental climate with an annual average temperature of 8 6 c according to observational data from the weather station the annual average precipitation is 434 1 mm fig 5 while annual average evaporation is 1712 0 mm there are no large faults or magmatic rocks in the area yao and xia 2007 the four main aquifers corresponding to different strata in the coalfield are the jurassic yan an group j2y sandstone fractured aquifer the zhiluo group j2z sandstone fractured aquifer the quaternary pleistocene salawusu group q3s alluvial aquifers and the holocene eolian sand q4 eol pore aquifer li et al 2008 yang et al 2015 according to the pumping and draining tests conducted in the coalfield the hydraulic conductivity and specific capacity of the jurassic zhiluo group j2z sandstone aquifer is 0 05 2 11 m d and 0 02 0 03 l s m but hydraulic conductivity and specific storage of the jurassic yan an group j2y sandstone aquifer is just 0 00027 0 0003 m d and 0 000065 0 00058 l s m indicating poor permeability and water yield the main mined coal seam is 2 2 which is in the j2y group aquitards are present consisting of the baode group n2b red clay aquitard and the lishi group q2l loess aquitard qu et al 2020b the locations of the j2z sandstone aquifer at boreholes j6 and j7 were about 55 100 m and 35 85 m higher respectively than those of the main coal seam fig 2 the ningtiaota coalfield is 71 2 km2 in area and underground coal mines have been operating there for 10 years there are many long term monitoring boreholes in the coalfield boreholes j6 screened in the j2z aquifer j7 screened in the j2z aquifer and sk8 screened in the j2y aquifer were used in this study borehole j6 is located directly above panel s12003 which has a mining height of 4 2 m fig 3 this was undermined from 2017 to 2018 in a south to north direction and the working face passed borehole j6 on 10th may 2018 in addition borehole j6 neighbors panel s12002 which was undermined from 2019 to 2020 in a south to north direction fig 3 and the working face passed the eastern side of j6 on 20th february 2020 the phase and schedule of mining activity in different panels are shown in fig 4 borehole j7 is located directly above panel s1229 which has a mining height of 8 9 m and was undermined from 2016 to 2017 in an east to west direction and the working face passed j7 on 10th august 2017 borehole sk8 was used for comparison and is located at the southern boundary of the study area far from any panels or mining activity 3 methodology 3 1 borehole observations data on groundwater level and barometric pressure were obtained from pressure transducers installed in three observation wells hereafter called boreholes that were drilled in 2012 j6 j7 and sk8 in fig 2 boreholes j6 and j7 had a well radius of 70 mm and open hole depths of 215 m and 203 28 m respectively and penetrated to the j2y aquifer fig 2 boreholes j6 and j7 were screened in the j2z aquifer with casing pipe depths including screened sections of 151 4 m and 147 88 m respectively hence the water levels in the boreholes mainly represented that of j2z aquifer boreholes j6 j7 and sk8 were equipped with absolute pressure gauges solinst levellogger solinst canada ltd to observe dynamic variations in groundwater level borehole sk8 was also equipped with a solinst barologger to observe barometric pressures fig 2 both the sampling interval for water level and barometric pressure data are hour values we obtained a time series of barometric pressure covering the whole study period and water levels in borehole j6 from 2017 to 2020 and borehole sk8 from 2016 to 2020 however we could only obtain a water level time series from borehole j7 for the period 2016 october 2017 because mining activity in panel s1229 led to movement and cracking of the formation fig 5 a and b and deformation of the borehole fig 5c in addition j7 had missing data from 7 to 20 april 2017 due to equipment malfunction 3 2 time series analysis in general there are two types of time series analysis univariate and multivariate modeling which are selected according to the number of variables sahu et al 2009 in this study autocorrelation analysis univariate modeling angelini 1997 and coherence analysis multivariate modeling chatfield 2000 were used to detect the hydrological responses of the overburden aquifer to mining disturbance 3 2 1 autocorrelation analysis a correlogram c k is a plot of autocorrelation versus a lag time k lee and lee 2000 all the autocorrelations must lie within the range of 1 1 the autocorrelation coefficient r k is calculated by equation 1 chatfield 1980 1 r k c k c 0 c k 1 n t 1 n k x t x x t k x here n is the number of sample points x is a single event and x is the mean in autocorrelation analysis different autocorrelation functions r k are associated with different lag times k to give useful information about memory effects in the system i e the duration of the influence of an event angelini 1997 and the response time tr the lag time when r k decreases from 1 to 0 sahu 2004 3 2 2 coherence analysis the coherence function coxy f represents the relationship between two time series in terms of frequency jenkins and watts 1968 and can indicate whether changes in the output series correspond to the same type of changes in the input series it is defined as larocque et al 1998 2 c o x y f s x y f s x f s y f here sx f sy f and sxy f are spectral density functions and f is frequency cycles per day cpd the value of coxy f varies between 0 and 1 where 0 indicates two independent time series and 1 indicates two dependent series zhang and lόpez 2019 3 3 estimation of specific storage an artesian well may respond to earth tide and barometric pressure fluctuations at different time scales bredehoeft 1967 and the aquifer properties could be inferred by coupling the tidal and barometric pressure fluctuations and groundwater flow caused by the deformation on this basis the temporal variation of the properties of an aquifer could be inferred from the long term monitoring of the level of the well water elkhoury et al 2006 xue et al 2013 the in situ and temporal variation of aquifer properties such as the porosity φ compressibility β and specific storage ss could be inferred by combing the barometric pressure and tidal response igarashi and wakita 1991 3 β l e 1 l e 3 2 ρ g a s 1 ν β s 4 φ β β s 1 b b β f β s 5 s s ρ g α β 1 2 α 1 2 ν 3 1 ν ρ g φ β f β s

and βf is the water compressibility cutillo and bredehoeft 2011 in this study the ss was estimated by eq 3 5 using the estimated process of qu et al 2020a 4 results 4 1 changes in water level in this study the locations of boreholes j6 or j7 were set as the original points as shown in fig 6 a negative value of mining distance along the mining direction represents the distance between the working face and the borehole before the face has passed the borehole while a positive value represents the distance after the working face has passed the borehole as fig 6a shows a gradual decline in water level was observed before april 2018 after april 2018 the water level in j6 began to show an abnormal change with the mining distance about 227 m indicating that the influential scope of s12003 panel is around 227 m when the mining distance of s12003 reached 0 m i e subjacent to the location of j6 decline of water level reached 20 m then the water level began to recover after the working face of s12003 passed j6 taking 80 days to recover to the original level afterward another panel s12002 located near s12003 began to be worked from 2019 and passed the eastern side of j6 on february 24th 2020 fig 3 when the mining distance of s12002 reached 0 m i e lateral to j6 and about 150 m far away from j6 fig 6b the water level decreased by 2 5 m indicating that the influential scope of s12002 panel is around 150 m and then water level remained stable without recovering as shown in fig 6c the water level in borehole j7 showed a gradual change before june 2017 after june 2017 the water level in j7 began to show a sharp change with the mining distance about 401 m indicating that the influential scope of s1229 panel is around 401 m when the mining distance of s1229 reached 0 m i e subjacent to j7 decline of water level reached 40 m then the water level began to recover after the working face passed j7 in contrast the water level in borehole sk8 which was more than 2 km away from the three panels remained stable without any large fluctuations throughout the study period indicating that j6 and j7 were disturbed by mining activity based on in situ observation data the changes in water level induced by different panels were qualitatively analyzed to explore and quantify the changes in water level time series analysis was conducted in this study the water level time series was divided into three stages pre during and post disturbance fig 6 the lengths of time and amounts of data were the same for each stage which was helpful in identifying the hydrological response of the overburden aquifer to identify the changes in water level in boreholes j6 and j7 induced by mining disturbance from panels s12003 s12002 and s1229 the water level time series of j6 and j7 were used in autocorrelation analysis at the pre disturbance stage the auto correlogram of water levels in j6 and j7 displays slow decays along with an increased lag time fig 7 this represents a strong linear inter relationship and repetitive behavior of the variable lee and lee 2000 indicating an influence of periodic factors e g barometric pressure at the stage of in disturbance the three auto correlograms quickly decrease to 0 fig 7 this indicates that the influence of the periodic factors declined in other words the response of water level to barometric pressure i e barometric effect doan et al 2006 may have been influenced by mining disturbance thus autocorrelation analysis could effectively identify the hydrological responses to disturbance at the post disturbance stage the auto correlogram indicated that there was a recovery in the water level in borehole j6 indicating a recovery in the linear inter relationship and repetition behavior of the groundwater according to the autocorrelation analysis the barometric effect on groundwater may be influenced by mining disturbance fig 7 in fact other periodic force such as earth tide shares similar frequency band in the semi diurnal and diurnal band but we just discuss the barometric effect in this study the reason is that the barometric effect is widespread and general by contrast the groundwater level in some boreholes sometimes have little or no response to earth tides qu et al 2020c in conclusion the discussion of barometric effect is of universality and applicability thus we employed coherence analysis between water level and barometric pressure on this basis coherence analysis was used to directly quantify and explore the changes in the barometric effect under mining disturbance as shown in fig 8 the changes in the coherence function cb between water level and barometric pressure for pre in and post disturbance stages were determined in hydrology frequencies of 1 cpd and 2 cpd i e frequencies of the k1 and s2 constituents doan et al 2006 are the main frequencies of barometric pressure loading xue et al 2016 qu et al 2020b so the changes in the coherence function at these two frequencies were focused on at the pre disturbance stage high cb values were observed in boreholes j6 and j7 at frequencies of 1 cpd and 2 cpd cb 0 7 indicating a strong barometric effect on the groundwater in contrast the cb value in j6 and j7 showed obvious decreases at the in disturbance stage indicating that the barometric effect declined fig 8 at the post disturbance stage the cb in j6 recovered indicating a recovery of the barometric effect these findings are consistent with the results of the autocorrelation analysis described above 4 2 changes in specific storage ss in addition to water levels and barometric effects change in the ss is another important indicator however the continuous in situ measurement of ss is difficult and challenging booth 2002 sui et al 2015 in this case monitoring of the groundwater tidal response is an effective and passive way to achieve the continuous in situ measurement of ss qu et al 2020a and quantify the hydrological responses of overburden aquifers to mining activities as fig 9 shows the ss values in boreholes j6 j7 and sk8 had an order of magnitude of 10 5 m 1 before mining disturbance however the ss of j6 began to decrease after april 2018 when the mining distance of s12003 reached 0 m i e subjacent to j6 the ss of j6 ranged from approximately 2 10 5 to 2 10 7 m 1 with a two order of magnitude decrease then ss began to recover after the working face of s12003 passed j6 recovering to its previous level in about 80 days afterward the ss of j6 began to show an obvious decrease after february 2020 fig 9b when the mining distance of s12002 reached 0 m i e lateral to j6 the values of ss ranged from 2 10 5 to 4 10 6 m 1 a decrease of less than one order of magnitude then ss recovered to its previous level fig 9b as shown in fig 9c the ss of borehole j7 began to decrease after june 2017 when the mining distance of s1229 reached 0 m i e subjacent to j7 ss did not decrease to a minimum but continued to decrease to 2 10 7 m 1 a decrease of more than two orders of magnitude 5 discussion the above results indicate that time series analysis and groundwater tidal response analysis can effectively identify the hydrological responses of overburden aquifers to mining disturbance on this basis the mechanisms of hydrological responses are discussed which is beneficial in understanding how overburden aquifers are affected by mining disturbance 5 1 mechanism of change in water level the time series of water level data from boreholes j6 j7 and sk8 were analyzed from 2016 to 2020 stable water levels or slow declines were observed in j6 j7 and sk8 at the pre disturbance stage fig 6 after april 2018 the water level in j6 began to show an obvious decline indicating an abnormal disturbance mining of panel s12003 after mining disturbance the water level in j6 recovered to its previous level in about 80 days however we found that the water level of j6 showed rapid rise above its initial level before returning to its initial level the possible reason is that the fractures at the bottom of borehole is caused by instantaneous extrusion closure associated with the recovery of aquifer property qian and xu 2019 in contrast as the working face of s12002 gradually approached the location lateral to j6 the water level did not show any decrease before the working face passed it fig 6b the water level in borehole j6 began to decrease by 2 5 m on the other hand the decline of water level induced by panel s12002 was 17 5 m less than that induced by s12003 an approximate difference of 87 5 fig 6a and b indicating that s12002 caused less disturbance to j6 at the post disturbance stage the water level and ss in borehole j6 after disturbance by panel s12003 both recovered to their initial levels however the water level in j6 after disturbance by s12002 remained stable without recovery while ss recovered to its initial level fig 9b this indicates that there was another factor influencing the water level after disturbance by s12002 besides changes of aquifer parameters the water in overburden aquifer also could be removed by the pumping of mine drainage pump house in tunnel during mining process qu et al 2020c according to water inflow data from panels s12002 and s12003 table 1 s12003 had near zero water inflow over the whole period therefore the decline of water level in j6 induced by s12003 was mainly determined by the ss in contrast the water inflow in s12002 was obviously greater than that in s12003 so the decline of water level in s12002 was not only influenced by the aquifer parameter but also by mine drainage qu et al 2020c thus at the post disturbance stage panel s12002 ss recovered but the water level did not indicating that the water level in j6 was constantly affected by mine drainage from panel s12002 the water level in borehole j7 began to show an instantaneous decline after july 2017 fig 6c indicative of abnormal disturbance mining disturbance from panel s1229 additionally the greatest the decline of water level in j7 induced by panel s1229 was 40 m which was double that induced in j6 by panel s12003 this indicates that the disturbance from s1229 was so strong that the decline of water level in j7 was much larger than that in j6 however when the working face of s1229 passed j7 the water level began to recover but ss did not this indicates that recovery of the water level in borehole j7 was not only decided by ss but possibly also by recharge from other areas according to the water table contour and groundwater flow direction fig 2 borehole j7 was located in a discharge area and received runoff recharge from a recharge area west of the study area furthermore the greater decline of water level induced by mining disturbance could lead to a lower water table contour around j7 so it could receive recharge and recover its water level during this period based on the in situ water level observations described above autocorrelations of hourly water levels in boreholes j6 and j7 were calculated to compare the hydrological characteristics of the pre in and post disturbance stages the memory effect and response time tr are two common indicators used to interpret the autocorrelation of signals firstly if an event has a long term memory effect such as barometric pressure loading the slope of the autocorrelation function decreases slowly while in the case of an event with a short memory effect the slope decreases very rapidly with increasing lag time lee and lee 2000 secondly if an event has a long tr the system has a high storage capacity sahu et al 2009 in this study the memory effect was quantified by fitting the rate of decrease of the autocorrelation function fig 10 it is a logarithmic law of the form r k a ln k b where a represents the speed at which information is lost and b is a parameter related to the amplitude of the correlation for a unit lag time k 1 day massei et al 2006 parameter a is a key parameter controlling the rate of decrease of the autocorrelation function and the memory effect the results of a at different stages of mining disturbance are summarized in table 2 at the pre disturbance stage of the three panels the auto correlograms of water levels influenced by panels s12003 s12002 and s1229 show slow rates of decrease a 0 014 0 032 and 0 004 respectively along with an increased lag time fig 7 these show long memory effects and tr values indicating a strong barometric effect and high storage capacity however at the in disturbance stage the auto correlograms displayed rapid rates of decrease a 0 29 0 268 and 0 216 respectively along with increased lag times fig 7 these show a decreased memory effect and tr value indicating a weaker barometric effect and lower storage capacity this is consistent with the decreases of ss in boreholes j6 and j7 fig 9 a possible reason is that mining disturbance influenced the barometric effect which is discussed in the coherence analysis below at the post disturbance stage the auto correlograms of water levels under the influence of panels s12003 and s12002 recovered fig 7 including the values of a and tr indicating recoveries in the barometric effect and storage capacity the recovery of storage capacity derived from the autocorrelation is consistent with the temporal evolution in ss described above fig 9 to investigate whether mining disturbance affects the barometric effect coherence analyses between water level and barometric pressure were conducted for the pre in and post disturbance periods above all we can find that the coherence function between groundwater level and barometric pressure in j6 and j7 are different the possible reason is that the confinement of every borehole is different because of different borehole construction zhang et al 2021 and the barometric effect is related to confinement thus different borehole construction fig 3 between j6 and j7 will lead to this difference which is a common phenomenon on this basis at the pre disturbance stage of the three panels high cb values at frequencies of 1 cpd and 2 cpd were observed between barometric pressure and water level fig 8 however the cb decreased at the in disturbance stage indicating a weaker barometric effect fig 8 the possible reason is that a large decline in water level induced by mining disturbance affected the pore pressure booth 2007 david et al 2017 which may have disturbed the transmission of strain induced by barometric pressure consequently the barometric effect on groundwater may decline at the post disturbance stage the cb value in borehole j6 recovered fig 8a and b which may be caused by recovery in ss fig 9a and b 5 2 mechanism of change in the specific storage in this study we determined the temporal changes in specific storage ss during mining periods fig 9 variation in ss values can play an important role in understanding the hydrological responses of aquifer systems to mining activities our study showed that parameter ss was affected by mining disturbance with more significant disturbance associated with the approaching of a working face as shown in fig 9 the changes of ss values in boreholes j6 and j7 showed obvious differences during mining disturbance from panels s12003 s12002 and s1229 after april 2018 the ss values in j6 approximately ranged from 2 10 5 to 2 10 7 m 1 with a two order of magnitude decrease during disturbance from panel s12003 after february 2020 the ss values in j6 approximately ranged from 2 10 5 to 4 10 6 m 1 with a less than one order of magnitude decrease during disturbance from s12002 in contrast the ss values in j7 approximately ranged from 2 5 10 5 to 1 10 7 m 1 with a greater than two orders of magnitude decrease during disturbance from s1229 it is obvious that the impacts of the panel working faces on the ss values in boreholes j6 and j7 followed the order of s1229 s12003 s12002 and were possibly influenced by the degree of disturbance of the different panels additionally the values of ss began to increase after the working faces of panels s12003 and s12002 passed borehole j6 and recovered to their initial values fig 9a and b in contrast the ss values in j7 still decreased without recovery even after the s1229 working face was about 40 m past the borehole fig 9c meanwhile strong disturbance by panel s1229 led to crack formation and borehole deformation fig 5 thus we deduced that the differences in the recovery processes were also influenced by the degree of disturbance caused by the different panels based on the empirical formula for the height of the water flow fractured zone including the fractured zone and caved zone li 2016 6 h l 100 m 1 6 m 3 6 5 6 here hl is the height of the water flow fractured zone and σm is the thickness of the coal seam which was 4 2 m for panel s12003 and 8 9 m for panel s1229 it has been calculated that the hl of s12003 was 46 30 m and that of s1229 was 55 49 m as mentioned above the groundwater levels in boreholes j6 and j7 represented those of the jurassic zhiluo group j2z sandstone aquifer so the disturbance by panel s1229 was greater than that of s12003 and at the locations above these panels the j2z aquifer was in fractured and constrained zones respectively in the constrained zone the decreases in water level and ss in borehole j6 were expected to be the result of stress changes compression of strata which can easily produce horizontal fractures but not vertical ones fig 1 mills 2012 matetic and trevits 1991 the groundwater flow in the constrained zone above panel s12003 was horizontal and had difficulty entering into mining tunnels fig 1 so the water inflow of panel s12003 was close to zero table 1 however the fractured zone contained connected vertical fractures fig 1 booth 2002 so the decline in water level was greatest in borehole j7 according to cheng et al 2017 and zhao et al 2018 in the process of mining the strata of the constrained zone undergo a process of elastic plastic deformation while the fractured zone undergoes deformation yielding and cracking thus there is less destruction of the strata in the constrained zone than that in the fractured zone elastic deformation may occur and the maximum effective stress will not reach the yield point qu et al 2020a thus the aquifer parameter in the constrained zone can recover in response to stress changes relaxation of strata in contrast the formation cracking and deformation of borehole j7 prove that there was damage in the fractured zone so that the overburden properties in the fractured zone had difficulty in completely recovering liu and elsworth 1997 as for panel s12002 which neighbored s12003 and passed the location lateral to borehole j6 fig 3 the overburden aquifers were neither in fractured nor constrained zones this makes it difficult to produce horizontal or vertical fractures such that the aquifer parameter could easily recover and the disturbance from panel s12002 was the least from the above it can be seen that the degree of disturbance caused by different panels followed the order of s1229 s12003 s12002 which is consistent with the changes in water level and ss according to the above results the changes in water level and ss showed a strong relationship in boreholes j6 and j7 under disturbance from panels s12003 and s1229 respectively according to principle of effective stress terzaghi 1943 7 σ σ ρ here σ is applied stress σ is effective stress and p is pore pressure when the pore pressure decreases fig 6a c and the applied barometric pressure is relatively constant fig 6d the effective stress will increase and the overburden strata will compress leading to a decrease in ss in contrast when the working face of panel s12002 approached borehole j6 the value of ss showed a gradual decrease fig 9b however the water level did not fig 6b when the working face of s12002 passed j6 and the ss value was the lowest the water level in the borehole began to decrease the process was different from those occurring in boreholes j6 and j7 under disturbance from panels s12003 and s1229 as discussed above the disturbance from s12002 was the smallest so it did not have much potential to produce horizontal or vertical fractures however the waves associated with mining induced seismicity from panel s12002 may have led to a redistribution of some of the particles in the aquifer liu and manga 2009 and a small decrease in ss however it did not induce an obvious decline in water level only when ss continues to decrease to a certain value due to disturbance will the water level show a decline thus there was a time lag between the variations in ss and water level because of the lower degree of mining disturbance caused by panel s12002 in conclusion the process of disturbance by panel s12002 was different from those of s12003 and s1229 the degree of disturbance caused by the three panels followed the order of s1229 s12003 s12002 on this basis the changes in water level and ss induced by s12003 and s1229 were synchronous and followed the principle of effective stress in contrast the change in water level induced by panel s12002 lagged behind the change in ss due to the redistribution of partial particles 5 3 relationships between hydrological responses the hydrological responses identified above being the decline in water level h response time of autocorrelation tr coherence between water level and barometric pressure cb and specific storage ss showed certain relationships associated with mining the quantitative relationships between these variables are important in revealing the possible mechanisms controlling the hydrological responses for this purpose the correlation coefficients r between these factors were calculated by spss 19 0 table 3 factors tr and ss were positively correlated r 0 794 indicating that both tr and ss reflect the storage capacity of aquifers which is consistent with the results above in addition cb and ss were positively correlated r 0 821 indicating that the barometric effect was influenced by the storage capacity of the aquifers the reason is that h was negatively correlated with ss r 0 706 indicating that a decrease in ss may lead to increased h meanwhile an increase in h could induce a decrease in pore pressure causing the transmission of strain induced by barometric pressure to be disturbed which may be reflected by the negative correlation between h and cb r 0 86 consequently cb was positively correlated with ss although all the correlations discussed above are significant at the 0 05 or 0 1 levels the correlation coefficient between h and ss was lowest r 0 706 table 3 the reason is that h was not only controlled by ss but was also influenced by mine drainage or recharge the quantitative relationships found between different hydrological responses are consistent with the results above 6 conclusions in this paper we used the method of the time series analysis and groundwater tidal responses to identify changes in water level specific storage ss and the barometric effect in boreholes j6 and j7 in relation to the longwall mining of panels s12003 s12002 and s1229 the main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 when boreholes j6 and j7 under mining disturbance of panels 12003 s12002 and s1229 the water level declined by 2 5 40 m ss decreased by 1 2 orders of magnitude and the barometric effect declined 2 the degree of disturbance caused by the three panels followed the order of s1229 s12003 s12002 on this basis the changes in water level and ss induced by s12003 and s1229 were synchronous due to the production of horizontal or vertical fractures by mining disturbance in contrast the change in water level induced by panel s12002 lagged behind the change in ss due to the redistribution of partial particles by waves associated with mining induced seismicity 3 after mining disturbance the water level ss and the barometric effect in j6 and j7 showed different recovery process we found that the degree of mining disturbance water inflow or runoff recharge were controlling factors influencing recovery process the results of this study could enhance our understanding of the mining induced hydrological responses in an overburden aquifer and could have

4172,excess nutrients in aquatic ecosystems is a major water quality problem globally worsening eutrophication issues are notable in cold temperate areas with pervasive problems in many agriculturally dominated catchments predicting nutrient export to rivers and lakes is particularly difficult in cold agricultural environments because of challenges in modelling snow soil frozen ground climate and anthropogenic controls previous research has shown that the use of many popular small basin nutrient models can be problematic in cold regions due to poor representation of cold region hydrology in this study the cold regions hydrological modelling platform crhm a modular modelling system which has been widely deployed across canada and cold regions worldwide was used to address this problem crhm was extended to simulate biogeochemical and transport processes for nitrogen and phosphorus through a complex of new process based modules that represent physicochemical processes in snow soil and freshwater agricultural practices such as tillage and fertilizer application which strongly impact the availability and release of soil nutrients can be explicitly represented in the model a test case in an agricultural basin draining towards lake winnipeg shows that the model can capture the extreme hydrology and nutrient load variability of small agricultural basins at hourly time steps it was demonstrated that fine temporal resolutions are an essential modelling requisite to capture strong concentration changes in agricultural tributaries in cold agricultural environments within these ephemeral and intermittent streams on average 30 31 20 and 16 of the total annual load of nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 soluble reactive phosphorus srp and particulate phosphorous partp no3 nh4 srp and partp occurred during the episodic snowmelt freshet 9 days accounting for 21 of the annual flow but shows extreme temporal variation the new nutrient modules are critical tools for predicting nutrient export from small agricultural drainage basins in cold climates via better representation of key hydrological processes and a temporal resolution more suited to capture dynamics of ephemeral and intermittent streams keywords catchment nutrients hydrology cold regions simulation management 1 introduction reducing nutrient losses from agricultural fields has been a major priority worldwide for many years due to increasing concerns with enhanced aquatic productivity and algal blooms water quality models for both basin and in stream studies have been widely used to support nutrient management but have often been problematic in seasonally cold regions such as canada and the northern united states due to deficiencies in the representation of key processes specific to these regions cold regions hydrology cannot be represented by the classical concepts of rainfall runoff models due to water storage by the seasonal snowcover snow redistribution by wind radiation driven snowmelt infiltration to and runoff over seasonally frozen ground poorly defined drainage due to glacial geomorphology and highly episodic runoff events pomeroy et al 2007 regional biogeochemistry in soils and runoff is challenging to model due to cold temperatures and seasonal soil freezing that influence nutrient release from soil plant systems plant uptake and microbial activity which in combination with management practices including fertilizer applications tillage practices and wetland drainage affect the hydrochemistry of soils and runoff baulch et al 2019 costa et al 2020a irvine et al 2019 van esbroeck et al 2017 macrae et al 2007 the dynamics of nutrient storage and release in cold climates are strongly affected by various cold regions hydrological processes and conditions deelstra et al 2009 snowpacks collect and transform chemicals during winter and rapidly release them during snowmelt pomeroy et al 2005 with a significant portion of the nutrients contained in runoff being transformed and retained in topographical depressions neely and baker 1989 crumpton and isenhart 1993 birgand et al 2007 spring snowmelt is the largest runoff event of the year in cold regions such as the northern great plains of north america gray et al 1970 and accounts for most of the annual nutrient export baulch et al 2019 the magnitude of peak flows furing spring freshet depends not only on overwinter snow accumulation but also on the antecedent soil moisture and basal snowpack and ground ice conditions gray et al 1986 pomeroy et al 2007 except for runoff from intensive convective rainfall events summer flows are often small gray et al 1970 pomeroy et al 2007 nitrogen n and phosphorus p transported via cold regions agricultural runoff originate in soil vegetation or to a lesser extent the snowpack the soil n pool is highly dynamic with weathering of soil parent material and decomposition of soil organic matter providing sources of mineral n no3 n and nh4 n at rates depending on soil type and climate additional n enters the landscape through fertilizer application plant residues and atmospheric deposition transformations between labile and recalcitrant forms of n are generally biologically driven with n lost to the atmosphere through denitrification and volatilization or to depth as soils drain baulch et al 2011 madramootoo et al 2007 p exists in soils in both organic and inorganic forms the latter derived from weathering of apatite like n p enters the landscape through fertilizers plant residues and atmospheric deposition but is generally regarded to be less available due to soil sorption processes that are dependent on factors such as ph temperature and organic carbon content holtan et al 1988 phosphorus can be lost in runoff water especially when concentrations exceed the sorption capacity of the soil or when particulate p is transported along with soil through erosion processes soil frost can increase nutrient export by decreasing infiltration hence increasing soil water interactions at the surface where soil p concentrations are often the highest cade menun et al 2013 additionally freeze thaw cycles disrupt plant cells and increase nutrient leaching from residues and other vegetation white 1973 liu et al 2013a costa et al 2019a liu et al 2019 which can become an important additional source of nutrients during snowmelt particularly in the presence of young and actively growing plants cober et al 2018 elliott 2013 the impact of tillage practices on nutrient export is complex conservation tillage can cause the accumulation of plant residue on farm fields which can release nutrients to snowmelt runoff timmons et al 1970 miller et al 1994 ulén 1997 in addition by decreasing the mixing of the applied fertilizer reduced tillage increases nutrient soil stratification and can lead to higher nutrient concentrations in surficial soils which can be readily mobilized by runoff more reliable predictions of nutrient transport in cold agricultural basins have long been seen as a crucial to support nutrient management in canada costa et al 2020a baulch et al 2019 costa et al 2019b mekonnen 2016 identified 74 models of water quality worldwide but it has been noted that application of many of these models can be problematic in cold climates due to inadequate representation of many cold regions processes han et al 2010 costa et al 2020a reviewed the suitability of five prominent catchment nutrient models for application in cold climates swat arnold et al 1998 inca whitehead et al 1998 wade et al 2002 hype lindström et al 2010 arheimer et al 2012 hspf bicknell et al 1997 bicknell et al 2005 duda et al 2012 and annagnps bosch et al 1998 they identified inadequate representation of cold climate hydrology and daily time steps to be some of the features most commonly limiting the utility of these models in cold regions they noted that most of these models have rarely been applied to cold regions with the exception of swat and hype they also found that some models allowed limited soil vertical resolution i e maximum number of soil layers that could reduce their performance in heavily stratified soils erosion remains a major challenge and meaningful model structures based on observable and transferable parameters were recommended to reduce the often high number of parameters for controlling biogeochemical transformations leading to parameter identifiability it was also highlighted that representations of accumulation of immobile nitrogen and phosphorus organic pools were often limited in their ability to represent legacy n and p for long term simulations the meteorological data typically used to force hydrological models e g solar radiation air temperature precipitation and wind speed are often measured on a daily basis this may limit the temporal resolution of model simulations and compromise their ability to capture hydrological and transport biogeochemical processes that may be subject to significant diurnal variations e g wind redistribution of snow and radiation driven snowmelt and episodic oscillations e g sediment erosion and soil nutrient release unfortunately in cold regions hydro biogeochemical processes activated during spring snowmelt and convective storms are often responsible for most of the annual nutrient export baulch et al 2019 kokulan et al 2019 thus long term simulations must also capture short term runoff events meaning that daily timestep models are insufficient for example the hspf model is one of the few nutrient models identified that are often run at default hourly time intervals for long term simulations however like many other models hspf does not explicitly account for some critical cold regions processes such as blowing snow and infiltration to and runoff over frozen soils and uses the daily time step empirical degree day method to estimate snowmelt a method that has long been found to be inadequate in many cold regions walter et al 2005 gray and landine 1988 there is a need to investigate alternative modelling approaches that are more applicable to cold agricultural basins better reflecting cold regions hydrological and biogeochemical processes which have a crucial impact on timing concentration and load of nutrients for this purpose a complex of new hydro biogeochemical modules was developed for the flexible modular cold regions hydrological modelling platform crhm crhm has been created specifically to improve the simulation of cold regions hydrology pomeroy et al 2007 and has been applied successfully to agricultural basins with minimal or no calibration fang and pomeroy 2008 fang et al 2010 mahmood et al 2017 cordeiro et al 2017 costa et al 2017 kokulan et al 2019 its merit as a flexible and fundamentally physically based cold regions hydrological model renders it an ideal model for incorporating nutrient processes and hence to offer a more suitable modelling framework to support nutrient management in agricultural cold regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 the cold regions hydrological model the cold regions hydrological model crhm has been developed from more than 55 years of research on canadian hydrology pomeroy et al 2007 it is a modular platform that discretizes the basin into hydrologically distinct landscape elements called hydrological response units hrus it provides a range of predictive methods embedded in various modules that can be selected depending on dominant climatic and regional settings i e mountains and prairie environments and are applied to calculate energy and mass budgets and fluxes on the hrus which are then aggregated through surface and subsurface routing to provide basin scale streamflow predictions crhm s focus on cold regions its ability to deal with prairie hydrology and the depressional storage relationship with contributing area i e only a fraction of the basin contributes to streamflow due to lack of hydrological connectivity that is common in post glacial river basins give it important capabilities that are neglected in most hydrological models pomeroy et al 2007 shook et al 2015 costa et al 2020b makes it attractive for hydro biogeochemical applications in these regions the model includes processes such as snow redistribution by wind and vegetation e g pomeroy and schmidt 1993 pomeroy et al 1998 snowmelt e g male and gray 1981 infiltration to unsaturated frozen soils including cracked soils e g granger et al 1984 evaporation from unsaturated surfaces e g granger and gray 1989 and hillslope water redistribution over frozen ground e g quinton and marsh 1999 crhm is typically run at hourly or sub hourly time steps which is another relevant aspect for capturing nutrient export during the short but critical spring snowmelt period baulch et al 2019 costa et al 2017 kokulan et al 2019 2 2 existing modules extending for nutrient transport fig 2 2 shows a simplified conceptual model of crhm to illustrate how existing hydrological modules were expanded to nutrient transport in other words all existing water mass balance and flux computations were extended to the transport of n and p considering different mineral and organic species see section 2 3 ahead within and across different hydrological compartments this includes a snow layer depressional storage e g that can be used for the representation of wetlands a subsurface flow layer two main soil layers and groundwater an additional surficial soil layer shown in red was introduced to describe the effect of soil mixing e g tillage practices and nutrient leaching the new mass balance transport equations for all n and p pools m new model state variables take the general

development of nutrient modelling capabilities for crhm is based upon developments in the process based wintra module costa et al 2019b costa et al 2017 roste 2015 this module constituted an important step in incorporating cold region processes in the computation of nutrient transport wintra targeted edge of the field eof simulations and explicitly focused on the development and incorporation of algorithms for the description of 1 the effect of snowcover depletion on the release of soil nutrients to runoff and 2 snow ion exclusion which is a process that causes snow ions to be eluted preferentially throughout the snowmelt process davies et al 1987 pomeroy et al 2005 costa et al 2019c costa et al 2018 these wintra algorithms were incorporated into the new modules shown here the reader is referred to costa et al 2019b and costa et al 2017 for more details about wintra snowpack module the snow module extended to water quality was pbsm and pbsmsnobal prairie blowing snow module these modules calculate blowing snow transport and sublimation fluxes between hrus see fig 2 2a based on precipitation snow availability wind speed air temperature and relative humidity pomeroy and li 2000 calculations of point transport and sublimation fluxes are performed using standard meteorological and landcover data or simple interfaces with atmospheric models by describing vertical humidity temperature and wind speed profiles in columns blowing snow thresholds for different wind speeds the effect of exposed vegetation on saltation and upwind fetch impacts on blowing snow flow development are considered the reader is referred to pomeroy and li 2000 and macdonald et al 2009 for more details about these modules soil module the soil module extended to water quality was soil pomeroy et al 2007 pomeroy et al 2016a this module divides the soil into 4 main compartments see fig 2 2a 1 a shallow subsurface detention flow layer 2 an upper soil compartment called the recharge layer 3 a lower soil compartment representing the remaining soil column to the bedrock or impermeable layer and 4 a groundwater compartment evaporation can occur from both soil compartments and surface infiltration recharges the upper soil compartment until field capacity before it percolates down to the lower compartment this is performed based on infiltration excess and storage excess infiltration concepts pomeroy et al 2007 dornes et al 2008 the excess water from both soil layers can be distributed to groundwater depressional storage and sub surface flow pomeroy et al 2016b water retained in the landscape via depressional storage can contribute to both surface flow and groundwater fang et al 2010 routing module the routing module extended to water quality is that calculates surface runoff subsurface runoff groundwater fluxes between hrus using the lag and route method developed by clark 1945 as described by fang et al 2010 the output flow of a given hru is redistributed into another or multiple hru s and it can recharge the groundwater depression storage the different soil layers or contribute directly to streamflow see fig 2 2b likewise groundwater flow from an hru can take similar or different hydrological pathways and flow directions the reader is referred to pomeroy et al 2007 for more information about this module 2 3 new modules biogeochemistry sources and sinks conceptual model fig 2 shows the conceptual model used for the representation of biogeochemical cycling of n panel a1 and p panel a2 species with panel b providing more details about the different sources sinks and transformation pathways it is adapted from the general approach used in the hype model lindström et al 2010 arheimer et al 2012 with modifications to emphasize important processes for canada and other cold regions highlighted below and for integration within crhm s model architecture the mobile i e moving with water chemical species simulated are nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n dissolved organic nitrogen don soluble reactive phosphorus srp dissolved organic phosphorus dop and particulate phosphorus partp four additional soil immobile organic pools are considered namely labile n and p and refractory n and p these pools represent the collective behaviour of the soil organic nutrient species that are either more reactive labile n and p with rapid turnover of nh4 and srp respectively or more stable refractory n and p with a slow turnover of nh4 and srp respectively the model time step is flexible but was primarily developed for and tested at hourly or sub hourly temporal resolutions this is an important capability to capture rapid snowmelt and convective storm driven rainfall runoff events a brief explanation of the logic used for the representation of the different biogeochemical processes sources and sinks is provided below but the reader is referred to supplementary material for a complete description of the theoretical and mathematical basis of these modules biogeochemical cycling the conceptual model of fig 2 was implemented using a process based approach that implies that the mass of a chemical species is produced for every other nutrient species consumed this mass balance is performed in terms of the n and p mass content of each chemical species the conversion rates f between species are described based on first order reaction kinetics that depends on the maximum reaction rate at the reference temperature of 20 c k reaction and is affected by temperature f temp soil moisture f θ w and half saturation concentration f cons this calculation takes the general form of eq 3 that is similar for all biogeochemical transformations described in fig 2b 3 f β f temp f θ w f cons k reaction c β where β is the chemical species consumed and c β is its concentration nitrification and denitrification are a source and sink of no3 respectively the organic labile n and labile p pools are subject to mineralization producing nh4 and srp respectively in turn refractory n and refractory p can degrade into labile n and labile p respectively dissolution of all soil organic pools labile n labile p refractory n and refractory p can produce dissolved organic nutrients don and dop the maximum mineralization degradation and dissolution rates at 20 are used as model inputs but the concentration of the respective source organic pool as well as temperature and soil moisture modulate the actual reaction rates throughout the simulation the adsorption of p onto soil particles is computed from a dynamic equilibrium calculation between srp and partp that is based on freundlich adsorption isotherm freundlich 1926 solved based on the interactive newton raphson method an approach also used in other models such as hype and hspf nutrient sources and sinks atmospheric deposition wet and dry atmospheric deposition can be added for all mobile species contemplated in the model no3 n nh4 n don srp dop parp for wet deposition the inputs are associated with precipitation and the users need to associate the corresponding nutrient concentrations to the precipitation flux for dry deposition deposition rates are defined via constants m t or dynamically as time series via input files the atmospheric deposition of nutrients is added to the snow or soil depending on the presence of snow and can include dust deposition on snow from windblown soils pomeroy and male 1987 blowing snow transport and sublimation the wind transport of mineral no3 n nh4 n srp and organic labile n and labile p nutrients is computed between hrus but also in and out of the basin depending on the blowing snow calculations performed by the wq pbsmsnobal module this allows to adequately account for snowdrifts and their effect on the spatial redistribution of snow nutrients the transformation of concentrations during blowing snow transport and sublimation is not currently not considered but will be addressed in future research fertilizer manure application plant residue and tillage practices nutrients from fertilizer fert and manure man applications can be added as mineral no3 n nh4 n srp and organic labile n and labile p inputs future research will consider enabling a fraction of manure to be treated as refratory p and n the timing duration and magnitude of fertilizer and manure applications for each hru are added via time series that can be loaded as input files it is possible to include the effect of tillage practices and the fertilizer application method e g broadcasted with seeding incorporated by splitting the fractions of fertilizer manure inputs that go into the surficial surfsoil and upper soil rechr soils layers the user can also define the fraction of mineral and organic n and p in manure similar to atmospheric deposition fertilizer and manure are added to the snowpack when present at the time of application while adding manure to the snow before snowmelt is strongly discouraged it is sometimes observed liu et al 2018 the infiltration rates computed by crhm are currently used to estimate nutrient leaching in the soils based on a scaling parameter snowpack soil runoff interactions for nutrient release the release of nutrients from snow and soil to runoff is based on the approach developed for the wintra module see section 2 2 and costa et al 2017 the effect of heterogeneous snowcovered area depletion and infiltration to partially frozen soils on the interaction between runoff and the soil is computed using snowcover depletion curves essery and pomeroy 2004 these curves are computed using coefficients of variation of maximum swe for each hru obtained through local measurements or literature values pomeroy et al 1998 areal infiltration to frozen soils is then calculated as per gray et al 2001 plant nutrient uptake plants are treated as both sources and sinks in the model plants are sinks of soil mineral n and p no3 nh4 and srp and are sources as plant litter of organic p and p labile n and p and refractory n and p the calculation of plant uptake rates of soil no3 nh4 and srp by plants is based on a variation of eq 3 this is a dynamic calculation that depends on the 1 plant crop type and its maximum uptake rate at a reference air temperature that is usually 20 o c and 2 concentration of the mineral nutrient being uptaken 3 soil moisture and 4 wilting point erosion of sediments and partp the calculation of the sediment and part p eroded fractions are based on the methodology used in hype lindström et al 2010 arheimer et al 2012 which relies on a parametric function for estimation of the potential energy of mobilization of falling hydrometeors and surface runoff the energy of falling hydrometeors is calculated using an empirical logarithmic curve that depends on precipitation rates and the time of the year the ability of falling hydrometeors to set soil particles into motion depends on the erodibility of the soil and crop cover erodibility is currently characterized by a parameter g j thus the fraction of soil particles mobilized by runoff is calculated empirically as a function of a soil cohesion coefficient kpa and the average hru slope once the maximum potential mobilizable partp is calculated additional parametric expressions are used to account for the average soil grain size i e finer particles are more likely to be eroded and contain more p the transport capacity of the field and the filtering capacity of river and buffer vegetation strips there are already ongoing efforts to further enhance this erosion model 2 4 model application the model was applied to the small steppler basin within the south tobacco creek basin manitoba which has a drainage area of 205 ha and contributes to lake winnipeg via the red river fig 3 a the steppler basin is of particular interest to the study of nutrient export to major canadian lakes because it is intensively farmed and contributes to lake winnipeg which is becoming increasingly eutrophic schindler et al 2012 the setup of the model benefited widely from the intense monitoring program established in this basin since 2005 as well as previous modelling work in the region e g roste 2015 mahmood et al 2017 and costa et al 2017 2019b the basin has been divided into 42 fields for research and monitoring purposes this division was used to define the hrus of the model fig 3b to maximize the direct use of the field data collected such as that related to agricultural practices hru numbering results from field numbering used throughout the stc research basin the results from previous research on hydrological connectivity and runoff pathways of this basin were used to characterize hru routing in crhm costa et al 2020b basin soils are dominantly the dezwood series moderately well to well drained orthic dark gray chernozem soils developed on calcareous deposits with a solum depth between 25 and 80 cm divided into 4 horizons ap at 0 12 cm bt at 12 40 cm bc at 40 50 cm and ck at 50 80 cm soil type was defined as 7 on a scale of 1 11 scale used in the soil modules of crhm with 1 corresponding to sand and 12 to clay based on geomorphological and soil quality assessments performed for the small experimental twin basin adjacent to the steppler basin michalyna 1994 the thickness of the till over the bedrock varies between 1 and 10 m michalyna 1994 and an average of 5 m was considered in combination with an estimated saturation water content of 0 42 to allowed to calculate a maximum soil moisture of 840 mm for use in the model crop rotations in the simulation period 2005 and 2011 the simulation period included mainly canola and wheat but also sporadically barley oat fall rye and pasture based on these crops a 1 m thick upper soil layer subject to evapotranspiration withdrawals was established there were no significant changes in drainage and forested area during this period and there is no tile drainage the surface water storage potential in wetlands holding ponds and weirs was represented by a maximum depressional storage defined for each hru the data available for model forcing and validation are summarized in table 1 the hydrological component was forced with meteorological data including precipitation air temperature relative humidity wind speed and incident short wave radiation these data were collected from a weather station near the northern border of steppler basin the weather station collects air temperature and rainfall data 5 min tipping bucket data but is not operational between late fall and early winter extrapolation of observations from four nearby weather stations was needed to complete data gaps during the winter months hourly air temperature relative humidity and wind speed data from the deerwood station 5 5 km distance from the basin were used for this purpose with occasional missing data being filled with data from the carman station located 45 km away from the basin the hydrological model results were validated using snow water equivalent swe and streamflow observations streamflow was estimated at five gauges distributed throughout the basin see fig 3 the recordings were performed at 15 to 30 min intervals they were upscaled to hourly averages to match the temporal resolution of the model the water quality component was forced with recorded fertilizer and manure application loads and validated for eof stream no3 n nh4 n srp and partp concentrations information about the amount location type timing and application method of fertilizer and manure in each field was collected by agriculture and agri food canada aafc and environment and climate change canada eccc and was used to force the model with n and p loading explicitly it was assumed that fertilizer application 1 with seeding was evenly split between the surfsoil and soil rechr layers to account for varying seeding depths 2 with broadcasting it mostly sits at the surfsoil layer but some degree of incorporation can be realized by high disturbance seeding implements 90 goes to surfsoil and the remaining to soil rechr and 3 with banding the placement of fertilizer is often below the surfsoil layer 80 goes to the soil rechr layer and the remaining to surfsoil see the hydrological compartments of the model in fig 1 future work should focus on refining and evaluating this splitting approach as well as improving the characterization of soil stratification soils are often measured at 0 5 cm 5 15 cm and 15 cm depths and frequently show considerable differences in nutrient concentrations additional information used to setup and parameterize the model included 1 average nutrient concentrations in catlle swine and chicken manure based on table 11 of larney et al 2006 2 plant nutrient update obtained from ipni 2020 3 plant residue assumed to correspond to 10 of the total n and p content of the plant in september that is left behind after harvest reich and oleksyn 2004 4 average mineralization rates at 20 oc for the canadian prairies was estimates as 0 065 week 1 campbell et al 1984 3 results 3 1 hydrology fig 4 compares observed and simulated swe in fields f3 and f4 locations are shown in fig 3 the observations correspond to the average snow accumulation peaks measured at the onset of spring snowmelt the results show that the model can capture both the interannual and spatial variabilities in swe distribution substantial heterogeneity in annual snow accumulation can be noticed within each field note the standard deviation error bars for each year as a measure of the spatial variation in the swe values but the model was able to predict these average patterns successfully observed and simulated streamflow are compared for the different hrus stream gauge stations fig 5 table 3 shows the model performance for both swe and streamflow as well as peak nutrient concentrations see section 3 2 the model can capture the strong spatiotemporal patterns of hydrological response within the basin it can generally predict well both the timing and magnitude of flows at different locations within the basin this is challenging as it can be noticed by the complex conceptual model needed for this basin see fig 3b and the wide range of flow values observed between hrus with hru 28 showing the highest peak values above 40 l s and hru 39 showing the lowest below 0 04 l s this basin is characterized by ephemeral streams and extreme events that include snowmelt and convective rainfall runoff storms a key aspect of these simulations is that they were performed at hourly time intervals this proved essential for capturing the highly non linear streamflow production patterns timing and magnitude in this basin more detailed analysis on the importance of hourly simulations is provided in section 4 2 the nse values obtained for hydrology and water quality may differ substantially depending on the number of observation points available as well as the amplitude of the observation values see table 2 for example in the case of hru 28 the nse obtained for hydrology is clearly penalizing some mismatch between observed and simulated flow peak magnitudes in some years see fig 5 flow rates increase and decrease many orders of magnitude 0 to 50 l s in a very short period of time such as during snowmelt e g days hours however the amplitude of the concentrations associated with these hydrological events is more modest for srp 0 to 1 mg l see ahead fig 8 as well as the other nutrients this benefits the nse performance metric 3 2 water quality nitrogen figs 6 and 7 compare observed and simulated streamflow no3 and nh4 concentrations respectively the model processes affecting the no3 and nh4 budgets are atmospheric deposition fertilizer manure plant uptake nitrification nh4 to no3 denitrification no3 loss to n2 and mineralization labilen to nh4 see fig 2 and section 2 3 the model can adequately capture both the timing and magnitude of concentration peaks of no3 and nh4 the concentrations are highly dynamic in part due to the transient nature of the streams within the steppler basin that often only transport flow during higher runoff events however there are some events and locations where the model performed poorly for no3 that should be highlighted such as in 2010 and particularly for hrus 17 29 and 38 a closer look into the results and model forcing in 2009 and 2010 shows no records of fertilizer application or tillage that could have caused the exceptionally high peak concentrations observed since there was nothing else documented about the farmers practices in this particular year we suspect that there was an issue with the reporting of 1 fertilizer manure application or 2 additional local source s e g feces from grazing livestock recall that the fields represented in hrus 17 and 29 are small about 17 and 6 hectares respectively therefore they have lower dilution capacity to buffer major new nutrient inputs phorphorus figs 8 and 9 compare observed and simulated srp and partp concentrations results suggest that the model can predict well the overall spatiotemporal concentration dynamics however similar to no3 fig 6 and nh4 fig 6 the model fails to simulate the magnitude of some high concentration peaks particularly in hru 34 although it is hard to identify the reasons for this mismatch it may be related to the same local effects described above for n that were not included in the model due to lack of information future model enhancements on the simulation of erosion and sediment sorption desorption mechanisms may also help to improve the prediction capacity of the model see section 4 3 for further discussion on possible sources of model uncertainty 4 discussion 4 1 critical management of timing of fertilizer use relative to major runoff events spring snowmelt is frequently the major annual nutrient export event in the canadian prairies but fertilizer and manure applications in the growing season can also be mobilized via summer and spring rainfall runoff events nicholaichuk 1967 hansen et al 2002 glozier et al 2006 liu et al 2013b this model and model application show that the timing of nutrient applications plays a key role in the amount of nutrients exported via runoff in southern manitoba fig 10 highlights that by showing the temporal impact of fertilizer application on surficial soil no3 n mass and eof streamflow concentrations while no3 nh4 srp are removed through plant uptake and biogeochemical processes e g nitrification denitrification dynamic equilibrium with partp excess fertilizer use can lead to nutrient accumulation in soils that can be mobilized with runoff fig 11 shows that snowmelt accounted for 30 31 20 and 16 of the total annual load of no3 nh4 srp and partp this is a disproportionate amount that was rapidely delivered during average 9 day freshet events annually that accounted for 21 of the annual flow field studies have also highlighted the importance of the amount type placement and timing of fertilizer application e g grant et al 2019 duncan et al 2017 plach et al 2018 the location relative to runoff pathways the depth relative to runoff water penetration brunet and westbrook 2012 king et al 2015 and the timing relative to major runoff events are all critical control factors in fertilizer use that impact nutrient export little et al 2007 baulch et al 2019 other determinants such as tillage practices and perennial vegetation can similarly affect the rate of nutrient uptake and contact time with runoff that can affect downstream transport of nutrients elliott and efetha 1999 tiessen and elliott 2010 renton et al 2015 liu et al 2014 4 2 the importance of hourly model temporal resolution fig 12 compares the predicted no3 left panel and nh4 right panel concentrations when using hourly black dotted line and daily gray line model resolutions results show that daily model simulations can capture the timing of concentration peaks but tend to underestimate their magnitude that s because they represent an average daily concentration that is intrinsically related to the temporal resolution of the hydrological simulations that average streamflow values to daily averages this can be problematic since such daily averages fail to capture the instantaneous severity i e intensity and rate of nutrient loads concentrations that are often observed by conventional water quality monitoring based on instant grab point sampling piniewski et al 2019 which has implications for overall load estimation williams et al 2015 4 3 importance of local effects lessons learned the model failed to capture the magnitude of specific high concentration peaks while it is hard to know with certainty the reason s for this mismatch model uncertainty propagation from the hydrological simulations to the water quality predictions can be substancial unrepresented local effects may also be an important source of error many of the fields within the steppler basin were used to grow forage that depending on amount and quality at freeze up could lead to additional loads e g white 1973 elliott 2013 costa et al 2019a similarly deficiencies in the reporting of fertilizer and manure use by farmers may also lead to the underrepresentation of the nutrient inputs in the model depending on the pathways of runoff surface wetland or tile drainage arrangements these additional local sources of nutrients can be mobilized with runoff brunet and westbrook 2012 king et al 2015 since crhm wq is process based see the conceptual model in figs 1 and 2 and was run at hourly timesteps it tracks the nutrients budgets in the soil soil pore water and surface water at fine temporal resolutions and so such misrepresentations of boundary conditions may have a substantial effect on the results for example while surface flow quickly interacts with surficial soil layers and can transport nutrients located mainly in these regions infiltration and subsurface flow mix with nutrients that may have leached through the soil profile through a more prolonged process while the model considers these hydrological pathways it requires the nutrient sources to be well understood and characterized in the model in order to predict hydrochemical fluxes well 4 4 contribution to the current modelling capacity a major challenge for the transient simulation of nutrient dynamics in cold agricultural environments is the adequate prediction of flowpath evolution despite evidence that this is a key factor in determining the origin of nutrients in runoff baulch et al 2019 costa et al 2020a 2017 however considerable progress has been made in recent decades in the simulation of hydrological processes in open cold regions with models such as crhm pomeroy et al 2007 mesh pietroniro et al 2007 and chm marsh et al 2020 these improvements allow for better predictions of blowing snow redistribution and sublimation pomeroy and schmidt 1993 snow densification and spatial variation in snow water equivalent swe pomeroy and gray 1995 pomeroy et al 1998 snow covered area depletion shook and gray 1996 snowmelt energetics gray and landine 1988 ground heat flux male 1980 turbulent fluxes male 1979 and runoff over frozen and partially frozen soils gray et al 2001 however despite the importance of these advances for adequate hydrological simulations they have not yet been fully integrated into nutrient models costa et al 2020a for instance wind redistribution of snow and sublimation can dramatically change the spatial distribution of snow in prairie environments pomeroy and schmidt 1993 and can transform chemical concentrations in snow pomeroy et al 1991 pomeroy and jones 1996 but are neglected in all process based nutrient models examined by costa et al 2020a that include swat inca hspf annagnps and hype some recent advances should be noted such as developments in swat to 1 account for the regulation of a snow nitrate pool by snow snowpack dynamics and snowmelt zhang et al 2016 and 2 the introduction of seasonally varying erodibility parameters to enable variations in soil erosion between frozen thawing and unfrozen soils mekonnen et al 2017 the new crhm wq model proposed in this study contributes to improving the physical hydrological and chemical basis of cold region water quality modelling this is important to support nutrient management in the cold agricultural regions of canada that face nutrient pollution in essence this was accomplished by 1 using chrm to provide the necessary hydrological simulations specialized in cold climates and 2 developing process based biogeochemical modules to represent n and p cycling this allows to examine the hydrology of these regions more accurately and study it s impact on nutrient concentrations across the different hydrological compartment fig 13 uncertainty analysis were not performed in this study due to its primary focus being on the development of the new nutrient modules for simulation of nutrient dynamics in cold agricultural regions however it is acknowledged that this as an important next step for future research 5 conclusions a series of process based transport and biogeochemical modules have been developed for the cold regions hydrological model crhm to simulate nitrogen n and phosphorus p in cold agricultural basins the new model aims to address critical issues with existing nutrient models for simulation of these environments the new modules calculate nutrient fluxes throughout the basins hydrological system that includes the snowpack soil streams and depressional storage e g potholes and wetlands this is possible through full coupling with the hydrology internally computed by crhm conceptual models for representation of the n and p biogeochemical cycles were implemented and include the explicit computation of transformation processes within and between different mineral and organic species no3 nh4 don organic labilen and organic refractoryn in the case of n and srp partp dop organic labilep and organic refractoryp in the case of p the model was applied to the agricultural steppler basin in manitoba and was generally able to capture the spatiotemporal patterns both timing and magnitude of swe streamflow and no3 nh4 srp and parp concentrations in streamflow the results highlight the importance of critical management in fertilizer application timing relative to major runoff events to avoid excessive nutrient export the model failed to capture some specific high magnitude nutrient concentration peaks potentially due to local effects such as animal grazing and feces which were not included due to lack of information or due to errors in simulation of peak flow events 6 data availability statement

4172,excess nutrients in aquatic ecosystems is a major water quality problem globally worsening eutrophication issues are notable in cold temperate areas with pervasive problems in many agriculturally dominated catchments predicting nutrient export to rivers and lakes is particularly difficult in cold agricultural environments because of challenges in modelling snow soil frozen ground climate and anthropogenic controls previous research has shown that the use of many popular small basin nutrient models can be problematic in cold regions due to poor representation of cold region hydrology in this study the cold regions hydrological modelling platform crhm a modular modelling system which has been widely deployed across canada and cold regions worldwide was used to address this problem crhm was extended to simulate biogeochemical and transport processes for nitrogen and phosphorus through a complex of new process based modules that represent physicochemical processes in snow soil and freshwater agricultural practices such as tillage and fertilizer application which strongly impact the availability and release of soil nutrients can be explicitly represented in the model a test case in an agricultural basin draining towards lake winnipeg shows that the model can capture the extreme hydrology and nutrient load variability of small agricultural basins at hourly time steps it was demonstrated that fine temporal resolutions are an essential modelling requisite to capture strong concentration changes in agricultural tributaries in cold agricultural environments within these ephemeral and intermittent streams on average 30 31 20 and 16 of the total annual load of nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 soluble reactive phosphorus srp and particulate phosphorous partp no3 nh4 srp and partp occurred during the episodic snowmelt freshet 9 days accounting for 21 of the annual flow but shows extreme temporal variation the new nutrient modules are critical tools for predicting nutrient export from small agricultural drainage basins in cold climates via better representation of key hydrological processes and a temporal resolution more suited to capture dynamics of ephemeral and intermittent streams keywords catchment nutrients hydrology cold regions simulation management 1 introduction reducing nutrient losses from agricultural fields has been a major priority worldwide for many years due to increasing concerns with enhanced aquatic productivity and algal blooms water quality models for both basin and in stream studies have been widely used to support nutrient management but have often been problematic in seasonally cold regions such as canada and the northern united states due to deficiencies in the representation of key processes specific to these regions cold regions hydrology cannot be represented by the classical concepts of rainfall runoff models due to water storage by the seasonal snowcover snow redistribution by wind radiation driven snowmelt infiltration to and runoff over seasonally frozen ground poorly defined drainage due to glacial geomorphology and highly episodic runoff events pomeroy et al 2007 regional biogeochemistry in soils and runoff is challenging to model due to cold temperatures and seasonal soil freezing that influence nutrient release from soil plant systems plant uptake and microbial activity which in combination with management practices including fertilizer applications tillage practices and wetland drainage affect the hydrochemistry of soils and runoff baulch et al 2019 costa et al 2020a irvine et al 2019 van esbroeck et al 2017 macrae et al 2007 the dynamics of nutrient storage and release in cold climates are strongly affected by various cold regions hydrological processes and conditions deelstra et al 2009 snowpacks collect and transform chemicals during winter and rapidly release them during snowmelt pomeroy et al 2005 with a significant portion of the nutrients contained in runoff being transformed and retained in topographical depressions neely and baker 1989 crumpton and isenhart 1993 birgand et al 2007 spring snowmelt is the largest runoff event of the year in cold regions such as the northern great plains of north america gray et al 1970 and accounts for most of the annual nutrient export baulch et al 2019 the magnitude of peak flows furing spring freshet depends not only on overwinter snow accumulation but also on the antecedent soil moisture and basal snowpack and ground ice conditions gray et al 1986 pomeroy et al 2007 except for runoff from intensive convective rainfall events summer flows are often small gray et al 1970 pomeroy et al 2007 nitrogen n and phosphorus p transported via cold regions agricultural runoff originate in soil vegetation or to a lesser extent the snowpack the soil n pool is highly dynamic with weathering of soil parent material and decomposition of soil organic matter providing sources of mineral n no3 n and nh4 n at rates depending on soil type and climate additional n enters the landscape through fertilizer application plant residues and atmospheric deposition transformations between labile and recalcitrant forms of n are generally biologically driven with n lost to the atmosphere through denitrification and volatilization or to depth as soils drain baulch et al 2011 madramootoo et al 2007 p exists in soils in both organic and inorganic forms the latter derived from weathering of apatite like n p enters the landscape through fertilizers plant residues and atmospheric deposition but is generally regarded to be less available due to soil sorption processes that are dependent on factors such as ph temperature and organic carbon content holtan et al 1988 phosphorus can be lost in runoff water especially when concentrations exceed the sorption capacity of the soil or when particulate p is transported along with soil through erosion processes soil frost can increase nutrient export by decreasing infiltration hence increasing soil water interactions at the surface where soil p concentrations are often the highest cade menun et al 2013 additionally freeze thaw cycles disrupt plant cells and increase nutrient leaching from residues and other vegetation white 1973 liu et al 2013a costa et al 2019a liu et al 2019 which can become an important additional source of nutrients during snowmelt particularly in the presence of young and actively growing plants cober et al 2018 elliott 2013 the impact of tillage practices on nutrient export is complex conservation tillage can cause the accumulation of plant residue on farm fields which can release nutrients to snowmelt runoff timmons et al 1970 miller et al 1994 ulén 1997 in addition by decreasing the mixing of the applied fertilizer reduced tillage increases nutrient soil stratification and can lead to higher nutrient concentrations in surficial soils which can be readily mobilized by runoff more reliable predictions of nutrient transport in cold agricultural basins have long been seen as a crucial to support nutrient management in canada costa et al 2020a baulch et al 2019 costa et al 2019b mekonnen 2016 identified 74 models of water quality worldwide but it has been noted that application of many of these models can be problematic in cold climates due to inadequate representation of many cold regions processes han et al 2010 costa et al 2020a reviewed the suitability of five prominent catchment nutrient models for application in cold climates swat arnold et al 1998 inca whitehead et al 1998 wade et al 2002 hype lindström et al 2010 arheimer et al 2012 hspf bicknell et al 1997 bicknell et al 2005 duda et al 2012 and annagnps bosch et al 1998 they identified inadequate representation of cold climate hydrology and daily time steps to be some of the features most commonly limiting the utility of these models in cold regions they noted that most of these models have rarely been applied to cold regions with the exception of swat and hype they also found that some models allowed limited soil vertical resolution i e maximum number of soil layers that could reduce their performance in heavily stratified soils erosion remains a major challenge and meaningful model structures based on observable and transferable parameters were recommended to reduce the often high number of parameters for controlling biogeochemical transformations leading to parameter identifiability it was also highlighted that representations of accumulation of immobile nitrogen and phosphorus organic pools were often limited in their ability to represent legacy n and p for long term simulations the meteorological data typically used to force hydrological models e g solar radiation air temperature precipitation and wind speed are often measured on a daily basis this may limit the temporal resolution of model simulations and compromise their ability to capture hydrological and transport biogeochemical processes that may be subject to significant diurnal variations e g wind redistribution of snow and radiation driven snowmelt and episodic oscillations e g sediment erosion and soil nutrient release unfortunately in cold regions hydro biogeochemical processes activated during spring snowmelt and convective storms are often responsible for most of the annual nutrient export baulch et al 2019 kokulan et al 2019 thus long term simulations must also capture short term runoff events meaning that daily timestep models are insufficient for example the hspf model is one of the few nutrient models identified that are often run at default hourly time intervals for long term simulations however like many other models hspf does not explicitly account for some critical cold regions processes such as blowing snow and infiltration to and runoff over frozen soils and uses the daily time step empirical degree day method to estimate snowmelt a method that has long been found to be inadequate in many cold regions walter et al 2005 gray and landine 1988 there is a need to investigate alternative modelling approaches that are more applicable to cold agricultural basins better reflecting cold regions hydrological and biogeochemical processes which have a crucial impact on timing concentration and load of nutrients for this purpose a complex of new hydro biogeochemical modules was developed for the flexible modular cold regions hydrological modelling platform crhm crhm has been created specifically to improve the simulation of cold regions hydrology pomeroy et al 2007 and has been applied successfully to agricultural basins with minimal or no calibration fang and pomeroy 2008 fang et al 2010 mahmood et al 2017 cordeiro et al 2017 costa et al 2017 kokulan et al 2019 its merit as a flexible and fundamentally physically based cold regions hydrological model renders it an ideal model for incorporating nutrient processes and hence to offer a more suitable modelling framework to support nutrient management in agricultural cold regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 the cold regions hydrological model the cold regions hydrological model crhm has been developed from more than 55 years of research on canadian hydrology pomeroy et al 2007 it is a modular platform that discretizes the basin into hydrologically distinct landscape elements called hydrological response units hrus it provides a range of predictive methods embedded in various modules that can be selected depending on dominant climatic and regional settings i e mountains and prairie environments and are applied to calculate energy and mass budgets and fluxes on the hrus which are then aggregated through surface and subsurface routing to provide basin scale streamflow predictions crhm s focus on cold regions its ability to deal with prairie hydrology and the depressional storage relationship with contributing area i e only a fraction of the basin contributes to streamflow due to lack of hydrological connectivity that is common in post glacial river basins give it important capabilities that are neglected in most hydrological models pomeroy et al 2007 shook

capturing nutrient export during the short but critical spring snowmelt period baulch et al 2019 costa et al 2017 kokulan et al 2019 2 2 existing modules extending for nutrient transport fig 2 2 shows a simplified conceptual model of crhm to illustrate how existing hydrological modules were expanded to nutrient transport in other words all existing water mass balance and flux computations were extended to the transport of n and p considering different mineral and organic species see section 2 3 ahead within and across different hydrological compartments this includes a snow layer depressional storage e g that can be used for the representation of wetlands a subsurface flow layer two main soil layers and groundwater an additional surficial soil layer shown in red was introduced to describe the effect of soil mixing e g tillage practices and nutrient leaching the new mass balance transport equations for all n and p pools m new model state variables take the general

development of nutrient modelling capabilities for crhm is based upon developments in the process based wintra module costa et al 2019b costa et al 2017 roste 2015 this module constituted an important step in incorporating cold region processes in the computation of nutrient transport wintra targeted edge of the field eof simulations and explicitly focused on the development and incorporation of algorithms for the description of 1 the effect of snowcover depletion on the release of soil nutrients to runoff and 2 snow ion exclusion which is a process that causes snow ions to be eluted preferentially throughout the snowmelt process davies et al 1987 pomeroy et al 2005 costa et al 2019c costa et al 2018 these wintra algorithms were incorporated into the new modules shown here the reader is referred to costa et al 2019b and costa et al 2017 for more details about wintra snowpack module the snow module extended to water quality was pbsm and pbsmsnobal prairie blowing snow module these modules calculate blowing snow transport and sublimation fluxes between hrus see fig 2 2a based on precipitation snow availability wind speed air temperature and relative humidity pomeroy and li 2000 calculations of point transport and sublimation fluxes are performed using standard meteorological and landcover data or simple interfaces with atmospheric models by describing vertical humidity temperature and wind speed profiles in columns blowing snow thresholds for different wind speeds the effect of exposed vegetation on saltation and upwind fetch impacts on blowing snow flow development are considered the reader is referred to pomeroy and li 2000 and macdonald et al 2009 for more details about these modules soil module the soil module extended to water quality was soil pomeroy et al 2007 pomeroy et al 2016a this module divides the soil into 4 main compartments see fig 2 2a 1 a shallow subsurface detention flow layer 2 an upper soil compartment called the recharge layer 3 a lower soil compartment representing the remaining soil column to the bedrock or impermeable layer and 4 a groundwater compartment evaporation can occur from both soil compartments and surface infiltration recharges the upper soil compartment until field capacity before it percolates down to the lower compartment this is performed based on infiltration excess and storage excess infiltration concepts pomeroy et al 2007 dornes et al 2008 the excess water from both soil layers can be distributed to groundwater depressional storage and sub surface flow pomeroy et al 2016b water retained in the landscape via depressional storage can contribute to both surface flow and groundwater fang et al 2010 routing module the routing module extended to water quality is that calculates surface runoff subsurface runoff groundwater fluxes between hrus using the lag and route method developed by clark 1945 as described by fang et al 2010 the output flow of a given hru is redistributed into another or multiple hru s and it can recharge the groundwater depression storage the different soil layers or contribute directly to streamflow see fig 2 2b likewise groundwater flow from an hru can take similar or different hydrological pathways and flow directions the reader is referred to pomeroy et al 2007 for more information about this module 2 3 new modules biogeochemistry sources and sinks conceptual model fig 2 shows the conceptual model used for the representation of biogeochemical cycling of n panel a1 and p panel a2 species with panel b providing more details about the different sources sinks and transformation pathways it is adapted from the general approach used in the hype model lindström et al 2010 arheimer et al 2012 with modifications to emphasize important processes for canada and other cold regions highlighted below and for integration within crhm s model architecture the mobile i e moving with water chemical species simulated are nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n dissolved organic nitrogen don soluble reactive phosphorus srp dissolved organic phosphorus dop and particulate phosphorus partp four additional soil immobile organic pools are considered namely labile n and p and refractory n and p these pools represent the collective behaviour of the soil organic nutrient species that are either more reactive labile n and p with rapid turnover of nh4 and srp respectively or more stable refractory n and p with a slow turnover of nh4 and srp respectively the model time step is flexible but was primarily developed for and tested at hourly or sub hourly temporal resolutions this is an important capability to capture rapid snowmelt and convective storm driven rainfall runoff events a brief explanation of the logic used for the representation of the different biogeochemical processes sources and sinks is provided below but the reader is referred to supplementary material for a complete description of the theoretical and mathematical basis of these modules biogeochemical cycling the conceptual model of fig 2 was implemented using a process based approach that implies that the mass of a chemical species is produced for every other nutrient species consumed this mass balance is performed in terms of the n and p mass content of each chemical species the conversion rates f between species are described based on first order reaction kinetics that depends on the maximum reaction rate at the reference temperature of 20 c k reaction and is affected by temperature f temp soil moisture f θ w and half saturation concentration f cons this calculation takes the general form of eq 3 that is similar for all biogeochemical transformations described in fig 2b 3 f β f temp f θ w f cons k reaction c β where β is the chemical species consumed and c β is its concentration nitrification and denitrification are a source and sink of no3 respectively the organic labile n and labile p pools are subject to mineralization producing nh4 and srp respectively in turn refractory n and refractory p can degrade into labile n and labile p respectively dissolution of all soil organic pools labile n labile p refractory n and refractory p can produce dissolved organic nutrients don and dop the maximum mineralization degradation and dissolution rates at 20 are used as model inputs but the concentration of the respective source organic pool as well as temperature and soil moisture modulate the actual reaction rates throughout the simulation the adsorption of p onto soil particles is computed from a dynamic equilibrium calculation between srp and partp that is based on freundlich adsorption isotherm freundlich 1926 solved based on the interactive newton raphson method an approach also used in other models such as hype and hspf nutrient sources and sinks atmospheric deposition wet and dry atmospheric deposition can be added for all mobile species contemplated in the model no3 n nh4 n don srp dop parp for wet deposition the inputs are associated with precipitation and the users need to associate the corresponding nutrient concentrations to the precipitation flux for dry deposition deposition rates are defined via constants m t or dynamically as time series via input files the atmospheric deposition of nutrients is added to the snow or soil depending on the presence of snow and can include dust deposition on snow from windblown soils pomeroy and male 1987 blowing snow transport and sublimation the wind transport of mineral no3 n nh4 n srp and organic labile n and labile p nutrients is computed between hrus but also in and out of the basin depending on the blowing snow calculations performed by the wq pbsmsnobal module this allows to adequately account for snowdrifts and their effect on the spatial redistribution of snow nutrients the transformation of concentrations during blowing snow transport and sublimation is not currently not considered but will be addressed in future research fertilizer manure application plant residue and tillage practices nutrients from fertilizer fert and manure man applications can be added as mineral no3 n nh4 n srp and organic labile n and labile p inputs future research will consider enabling a fraction of manure to be treated as refratory p and n the timing duration and magnitude of fertilizer and manure applications for each hru are added via time series that can be loaded as input files it is possible to include the effect of tillage practices and the fertilizer application method e g broadcasted with seeding incorporated by splitting the fractions of fertilizer manure inputs that go into the surficial surfsoil and upper soil rechr soils layers the user can also define the fraction of mineral and organic n and p in manure similar to atmospheric deposition fertilizer and manure are added to the snowpack when present at the time of application while adding manure to the snow before snowmelt is strongly discouraged it is sometimes observed liu et al 2018 the infiltration rates computed by crhm are currently used to estimate nutrient leaching in the soils based on a scaling parameter snowpack soil runoff interactions for nutrient release the release of nutrients from snow and soil to runoff is based on the approach developed for the wintra module see section 2 2 and costa et al 2017 the effect of heterogeneous snowcovered area depletion and infiltration to partially frozen soils on the interaction between runoff and the soil is computed using snowcover depletion curves essery and pomeroy 2004 these curves are computed using coefficients of variation of maximum swe for each hru obtained through local measurements or literature values pomeroy et al 1998 areal infiltration to frozen soils is then calculated as per gray et al 2001 plant nutrient uptake plants are treated as both sources and sinks in the model plants are sinks of soil mineral n and p no3 nh4 and srp and are sources as plant litter of organic p and p labile n and p and refractory n and p the calculation of plant uptake rates of soil no3 nh4 and srp by plants is based on a variation of eq 3 this is a dynamic calculation that depends on the 1 plant crop type and its maximum uptake rate at a reference air temperature that is usually 20 o c and 2 concentration of the mineral nutrient being uptaken 3 soil moisture and 4 wilting point erosion of sediments and partp the calculation of the sediment and part p eroded fractions are based on the methodology used in hype lindström et al 2010 arheimer et al 2012 which relies on a parametric function for estimation of the potential energy of mobilization of falling hydrometeors and surface runoff the energy of falling hydrometeors is calculated using an empirical logarithmic curve that depends on precipitation rates and the time of the year the ability of falling hydrometeors to set soil particles into motion depends on the erodibility of the soil and crop cover erodibility is currently characterized by a parameter g j thus the fraction of soil particles mobilized by runoff is calculated empirically as a function of a soil cohesion coefficient kpa and the average hru slope once the maximum potential mobilizable partp is calculated additional parametric expressions are used to account for the average soil grain size i e finer particles are more likely to be eroded and contain more p the transport capacity of the field and the filtering capacity of river and buffer vegetation strips there are already ongoing efforts to further enhance this erosion model 2 4 model application the model was applied to the small steppler basin within the south tobacco creek basin manitoba which has a drainage area of 205 ha and contributes to lake winnipeg via the red river fig 3 a the steppler basin is of particular interest to the study of nutrient export to major canadian lakes because it is intensively farmed and contributes to lake winnipeg which is becoming increasingly eutrophic schindler et al 2012 the setup of the model benefited widely from the intense monitoring program established in this basin since 2005 as well as previous modelling work in the region e g roste 2015 mahmood et al 2017 and costa et al 2017 2019b the basin has been divided into 42 fields for research and monitoring purposes this division was used to define the hrus of the model fig 3b to maximize the direct use of the field data collected such as that related to agricultural practices hru numbering results from field numbering used throughout the stc research basin the results from previous research on hydrological connectivity and runoff pathways of this basin were used to characterize hru routing in crhm costa et al 2020b basin soils are dominantly the dezwood series moderately well to well drained orthic dark gray chernozem soils developed on calcareous deposits with a solum depth between 25 and 80 cm divided into 4 horizons ap at 0 12 cm bt at 12 40 cm bc at 40 50 cm and ck at 50 80 cm soil type was defined as 7 on a scale of 1 11 scale used in the soil modules of crhm with 1 corresponding to sand and 12 to clay based on geomorphological and soil quality assessments performed for the small experimental twin basin adjacent to the steppler basin michalyna 1994 the thickness of the till over the bedrock varies between 1 and 10 m michalyna 1994 and an average of 5 m was considered in combination with an estimated saturation water content of 0 42 to allowed to calculate a maximum soil moisture of 840 mm for use in the model crop rotations in the simulation period 2005 and 2011 the simulation period included mainly canola and wheat but also sporadically barley oat fall rye and pasture based on these crops a 1 m thick upper soil layer subject to evapotranspiration withdrawals was established there were no significant changes in drainage and forested area during this period and there is no tile drainage the surface water storage potential in wetlands holding ponds and weirs was represented by a maximum depressional storage defined for each hru the data available for model forcing and validation are summarized in table 1 the hydrological component was forced with meteorological data including precipitation air temperature relative humidity wind speed and incident short wave radiation these data were collected from a weather station near the northern border of steppler basin the weather station collects air temperature and rainfall data 5 min tipping bucket data but is not operational between late fall and early winter extrapolation of observations from four nearby weather stations was needed to complete data gaps during the winter months hourly air temperature relative humidity and wind speed data from the deerwood station 5 5 km distance from the basin were used for this purpose with occasional missing data being filled with data from the carman station located 45 km away from the basin the hydrological model results were validated using snow water equivalent swe and streamflow observations streamflow was estimated at five gauges distributed throughout the basin see fig 3 the recordings were performed at 15 to 30 min intervals they were upscaled to hourly averages to match the temporal resolution of the model the water quality component was forced with recorded fertilizer and manure application loads and validated for eof stream no3 n nh4 n srp and partp concentrations information about the amount location type timing and application method of fertilizer and manure in each field was collected by agriculture and agri food canada aafc and environment and climate change canada eccc and was used to force the model with n and p loading explicitly it was assumed that fertilizer application 1 with seeding was evenly split between the surfsoil and soil rechr layers to account for varying seeding depths 2 with broadcasting it mostly sits at the surfsoil layer but some degree of incorporation can be realized by high disturbance seeding implements 90 goes to surfsoil and the remaining to soil rechr and 3 with banding the placement of fertilizer is often below the surfsoil layer 80 goes to the soil rechr layer and the remaining to surfsoil see the hydrological compartments of the model in fig 1 future work should focus on refining and evaluating this splitting approach as well as improving the characterization of soil stratification soils are often measured at 0 5 cm 5 15 cm and 15 cm depths and frequently show considerable differences in nutrient concentrations additional information used to setup and parameterize the model included 1 average nutrient concentrations in catlle swine and chicken manure based on table 11 of larney et al 2006 2 plant nutrient update obtained from ipni 2020 3 plant residue assumed to correspond to 10 of the total n and p content of the plant in september that is left behind after harvest reich and oleksyn 2004 4 average mineralization rates at 20 oc for the canadian prairies was estimates as 0 065 week 1 campbell et al 1984 3 results 3 1 hydrology fig 4 compares observed and simulated swe in fields f3 and f4 locations are shown in fig 3 the observations correspond to the average snow accumulation peaks measured at the onset of spring snowmelt the results show that the model can capture both the interannual and spatial variabilities in swe distribution substantial heterogeneity in annual snow accumulation can be noticed within each field note the standard deviation error bars for each year as a measure of the spatial variation in the swe values but the model was able to predict these average patterns successfully observed and simulated streamflow are compared for the different hrus stream gauge stations fig 5 table 3 shows the model performance for both swe and streamflow as well as peak nutrient concentrations see section 3 2 the model can capture the strong spatiotemporal patterns of hydrological response within the basin it can generally predict well both the timing and magnitude of flows at different locations within the basin this is challenging as it can be noticed by the complex conceptual model needed for this basin see fig 3b and the wide range of flow values observed between hrus with hru 28 showing the highest peak values above 40 l s and hru 39 showing the lowest below 0 04 l s this basin is characterized by ephemeral streams and extreme events that include snowmelt and convective rainfall runoff storms a key aspect of these simulations is that they were performed at hourly time intervals this proved essential for capturing the highly non linear streamflow production patterns timing and magnitude in this basin more detailed analysis on the importance of hourly simulations is provided in section 4 2 the nse values obtained for hydrology and water quality may differ substantially depending on the number of observation points available as well as the amplitude of the observation values see table 2 for example in the case of hru 28 the nse obtained for hydrology is clearly penalizing some mismatch between observed and simulated flow peak magnitudes in some years see fig 5 flow rates increase and decrease many orders of magnitude 0 to 50 l s in a very short period of time such as during snowmelt e g days hours however the amplitude of the concentrations associated with these hydrological events is more modest for srp 0 to 1 mg l see ahead fig 8 as well as the other nutrients this benefits the nse performance metric 3 2 water quality nitrogen figs 6 and 7 compare observed and simulated streamflow no3 and nh4 concentrations respectively the model processes affecting the no3 and nh4 budgets are atmospheric deposition fertilizer manure plant uptake nitrification nh4 to no3 denitrification no3 loss to n2 and mineralization labilen to nh4 see fig 2 and section 2 3 the model can adequately capture both the timing and magnitude of concentration peaks of no3 and nh4 the concentrations are highly dynamic in part due to the transient nature of the streams within the steppler basin that often only transport flow during higher runoff events however there are some events and locations where the model performed poorly for no3 that should be highlighted such as in 2010 and particularly for hrus 17 29 and 38 a closer look into the results and model forcing in 2009 and 2010 shows no records of fertilizer application or tillage that could have caused the exceptionally high peak concentrations observed since there was nothing else documented about the farmers practices in this particular year we suspect that there was an issue with the reporting of 1 fertilizer manure application or 2 additional local source s e g feces from grazing livestock recall that the fields represented in hrus 17 and 29 are small about 17 and 6 hectares respectively therefore they have lower dilution capacity to buffer major new nutrient inputs phorphorus figs 8 and 9 compare observed and simulated srp and partp concentrations results suggest that the model can predict well the overall spatiotemporal concentration dynamics however similar to no3 fig 6 and nh4 fig 6 the model fails to simulate the magnitude of some high concentration peaks particularly in hru 34 although it is hard to identify the reasons for this mismatch it may be related to the same local effects described above for n that were not included in the model due to lack of information future model enhancements on the simulation of erosion and sediment sorption desorption mechanisms may also help to improve the prediction capacity of the model see section 4 3 for further discussion on possible sources of model uncertainty 4 discussion 4 1 critical management of timing of fertilizer use relative to major runoff events spring snowmelt is frequently the major annual nutrient export event in the canadian prairies but fertilizer and manure applications in the growing season can also be mobilized via summer and spring rainfall runoff events nicholaichuk 1967 hansen et al 2002 glozier et al 2006 liu et al 2013b this model and model application show that the timing of nutrient applications plays a key role in the amount of nutrients exported via runoff in southern manitoba fig 10 highlights that by showing the temporal impact of fertilizer application on surficial soil no3 n mass and eof streamflow concentrations while no3 nh4 srp are removed through plant uptake and biogeochemical processes e g nitrification denitrification dynamic equilibrium with partp excess fertilizer use can lead to nutrient accumulation in soils that can be mobilized with runoff fig 11 shows that snowmelt accounted for 30 31 20 and 16 of the total annual load of no3 nh4 srp and partp this is a disproportionate amount that was rapidely delivered during average 9 day freshet events annually that accounted for 21 of the annual flow field studies have also highlighted the importance of the amount type placement and timing of fertilizer application e g grant et al 2019 duncan et al 2017 plach et al 2018 the location relative to runoff pathways the depth relative to runoff water penetration brunet and westbrook 2012 king et al 2015 and the timing relative to major runoff events are all critical control factors in fertilizer use that impact nutrient export little et al 2007 baulch et al 2019 other determinants such as tillage practices and perennial vegetation can similarly affect the rate of nutrient uptake and contact time with runoff that can affect downstream transport of nutrients elliott and efetha 1999 tiessen and elliott 2010 renton et al 2015 liu et al 2014 4 2 the importance of hourly model temporal resolution fig 12 compares the predicted no3 left panel and nh4 right panel concentrations when using hourly black dotted line and daily gray line model resolutions results show that daily model simulations can capture the timing of concentration peaks but tend to underestimate their magnitude that s because they represent an average daily concentration that is intrinsically related to the temporal resolution of the hydrological simulations that average streamflow values to daily averages this can be problematic since such daily averages fail to capture the instantaneous severity i e intensity and rate of nutrient loads concentrations that are often observed by conventional water quality monitoring based on instant grab point sampling piniewski et al 2019 which has implications for overall load estimation williams et al 2015 4 3 importance of local effects lessons learned the model failed to capture the magnitude of specific high concentration peaks while it is hard to know with certainty the reason s for this mismatch model uncertainty propagation from the hydrological simulations to the water quality predictions can be substancial unrepresented local effects may also be an important source of error many of the fields within the steppler basin were used to grow forage that depending on amount and quality at freeze up could lead to additional loads e g white 1973 elliott 2013 costa et al 2019a similarly deficiencies in the reporting of fertilizer and manure use by farmers may also lead to the underrepresentation of the nutrient inputs in the model depending on the pathways of runoff surface wetland or tile drainage arrangements these additional local sources of nutrients can be mobilized with runoff brunet and westbrook 2012 king et al 2015 since crhm wq is process based see the conceptual model in figs 1 and 2 and was run at hourly timesteps it tracks the nutrients budgets in the soil soil pore water and surface water at fine temporal resolutions and so such misrepresentations of boundary conditions may have a substantial effect on the results for example while surface flow quickly interacts with surficial soil layers and can transport nutrients located mainly in these regions infiltration and subsurface flow mix with nutrients that may have leached through the soil profile through a more prolonged process while the model considers these hydrological pathways it requires the nutrient sources to be well understood and characterized in the model in order to predict hydrochemical fluxes well 4 4 contribution to the current modelling capacity a major challenge for the transient simulation of nutrient dynamics in cold agricultural environments is the adequate prediction of flowpath evolution despite evidence that this is a key factor in determining the origin of nutrients in runoff baulch et al 2019 costa et al 2020a 2017 however considerable progress has been made in recent decades in the simulation of hydrological processes in open cold regions with models such as crhm pomeroy et al 2007 mesh pietroniro et al 2007 and chm marsh et al 2020 these improvements allow for better predictions of blowing snow redistribution and sublimation pomeroy and schmidt 1993 snow densification and spatial variation in snow water equivalent swe pomeroy and gray 1995 pomeroy et al 1998 snow covered area depletion shook and gray 1996 snowmelt energetics gray and landine 1988 ground heat flux male 1980 turbulent fluxes male 1979 and runoff over frozen and partially frozen soils gray et al 2001 however despite the importance of these advances for adequate hydrological simulations they have not yet been fully integrated into nutrient models costa et al 2020a for instance wind redistribution of snow and sublimation can dramatically change the spatial distribution of snow in prairie environments pomeroy and schmidt 1993 and can transform chemical concentrations in snow pomeroy et al 1991 pomeroy and jones 1996 but are neglected in all process based nutrient models examined by costa et al 2020a that include swat inca hspf annagnps and hype some recent advances should be noted such as developments in swat to 1 account for the regulation of a snow nitrate pool by snow snowpack dynamics and snowmelt zhang et al 2016 and 2 the introduction of seasonally varying erodibility parameters to enable variations in soil erosion between frozen thawing and unfrozen soils mekonnen et al 2017 the new crhm wq model proposed in this study contributes to improving the physical hydrological and chemical basis of cold region water quality modelling this is important to support nutrient management in the cold agricultural regions of canada that face nutrient pollution in essence this was accomplished by 1 using chrm to provide the necessary hydrological simulations specialized in cold climates and 2 developing process based biogeochemical modules to represent n and p cycling this allows to examine the hydrology of these regions more accurately and study it s impact on nutrient concentrations across the different hydrological compartment fig 13 uncertainty analysis were not performed in this study due to its primary focus being on the development of the new nutrient modules for simulation of nutrient dynamics in cold agricultural regions however it is acknowledged that this as an important next step for future research 5 conclusions a series of process based transport and biogeochemical modules have been developed for the cold regions hydrological model crhm to simulate nitrogen n and phosphorus p in cold agricultural basins the new model aims to address critical issues with existing nutrient models for simulation of these environments the new modules calculate nutrient fluxes throughout the basins hydrological system that includes the snowpack soil streams and depressional storage e g potholes and wetlands this is possible through full coupling with the hydrology internally computed by crhm conceptual models for representation of the n and p biogeochemical cycles were implemented and include the explicit computation of transformation processes within and between different mineral and organic species no3 nh4 don organic labilen and organic refractoryn in the case of n and srp partp dop organic labilep and organic refractoryp in the case of p the model was applied to the agricultural steppler basin in manitoba and was generally able to capture the spatiotemporal patterns both timing and magnitude of swe streamflow and no3 nh4 srp and parp concentrations in streamflow the results highlight the importance of critical management in fertilizer application timing relative to major runoff events to avoid excessive nutrient export the model failed to capture some specific high magnitude nutrient concentration peaks potentially due to local effects such as animal grazing and feces which were not included due to lack of information or due to errors in simulation of peak flow events 6 data availability statement

4173,drought may affect more people than any other climate extremes worldwide especially in semi arid climates such as iran in this paper the empirical multivariate standardized drought index msdi that incorporates the meteorological and agricultural drought conditions is first computed the wavelet analysis is then used to identify teleconnections between ocean atmosphere oscillations from atlantic amo ao and nao and pacific enso pdo and pna oceans and iran s drought at a highly dense network of regularly gridded points 2485 during 1979 2016 it is found that among the droughts of 1980 1985 86 1990 91 1998 99 2000 2007 08 and 2010 11 both the 2007 08 and 2000 are the broadest and strongest across the country overall those droughts that occurred in the 2000 2016 period average msdi 1 14 were on the whole stronger than those happened over the latest 20 years of the 20th century average msdi 0 77 reflecting the strengthening of the influence that enso has on the middle east climate in the most recent decades according to the wavelet coherence results unlike the atlantic based oscillations that almost have an anti correlation with droughts there is a positive correlation between pacific based oscillations and iran s drought it is also identified that the severe historical droughts across the country were usually associated with a strong la niña coupled with cold pdo and positive nao phases in the latest 30 years overall droughts in iran tend to be substantially controlled by multiple interacting of climate indices since three coupled indices have stronger coherence with drought than either two coupled indices or single ones a combination of the three indices of enso pdo and nao has the strongest coherence with iran s drought compared to all the other three and two coupled and all single indices indicating that integrated impact of climate indices can better capture hydroclimate teleconnections these multiple interacting impacts from the different large scale climate circulation patterns mark a significant step towards an improved prediction of severe droughts across iran and can also be used for other parts of the world keywords iran s drought atlantic and pacific atmospheric oscillations integrated indices multivariate standardized drought index meteorological and agricultural drought 1 introduction drought as a climate extreme occurring over large spatiotemporal scales is the most costly natural disaster that can cause widespread impacts on water and food crises e g hao et al 2014 it affects more people than any other climate extremes worldwide wilhite 2005 particularly in the semi arid climates for iran as a highly water stressed semi arid country severe drought can have complex consequences from direct impacts on water resources crops food desertification and livestock to indirect impacts associated with sanitation nutrition loss of livelihood migration and international disputes the nation s agriculture industry is highly sensitive to droughts since each 1 mm deficit in precipitation relative to the historical norm is approximated to lead to 90 million in losses madani et al 2016 as an example mousavi 2005 reported that around 7 8 billion worth of damage occurred mainly in the agriculture sectoracross the country over the 1999 2001 droughts iran is prone to severe and sustained droughts owing in part to its geographic and climatological characteristics and semi arid climate fathian et al 2015 rezaei and mohammadi 2017 furthermore droughts are of crucial importance for risk assessment hazard preparedness sustainable development and better plan for future drought disasters and water resources management hao and aghakouchak 2013 2014 jiang et al 2019 this has prompted a concern to characterize the phenomena controlling droughts across the country drought is categorized into meteorological focused on precipitation agricultural focused on soil moisture hydrological focused on surface and groundwater and socio economical focused on drought impacts on supply and demand of some economic goods several types of research have examined the teleconnections between ocean atmospheric oscillations and meteorological drought across iran nazemosadat and ghasemi 2004 and nazemosadat et al 2015 reported that during the la niña el niño phase much of the nation tends to be drier wetter than the normal condition salahi et al 2005 found that north atlantic oscillation nao has a weak negative correlation with meteorological drought across northwestern iran raziei et al 2009 indicated however that although dry wet periods occasionally correspond to the la niña el niño phase of el niño southern oscillation enso a stringent correlation exists between the phenomena nikzad et al 2013 studied the teleconnections of enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo pacific north american pna and nao indices with meteorological drought i e standardized precipitation index spi at the abadan station in southwest iran dezfuli et al 2010 examined the link between enso and nao indices and meteorological droughts they reported that the statistical correlation coefficients between the wet season drought and southern oscillation index i e enso and nao equal to 0 5 and 0 30 respectively darand 2014 classified the country into four regions based on the palmer drought index and then examined the region s droughts correlation with several climate indices during 1950 2005 he found that iran s drought generally has a positive correlation with enso pna and pdo and a negative correlation with nao recently mohammadrezaei et al 2020 rather concluded that amo has the highest coherence with meteorological iran s drought using cross correlation analysis nouri and homaee 2020 pointed out that the la niña has a significant impact on droughts across the country through computing the correlation coefficient between enso and the drought indicators of spi and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei in addition to the drought it has been however reported that the ocean atmospheric oscillations partially can influence precipitation temperature runoff and spring flowrate across the nation e g nazemosadat and ghasemi 2004 nazemosadat et al 2015 abbasi and maleki 2017 alizadeh choobari and najafi 2018 ahmadi et al 2019 alizadeh choobari and adibi 2019 dehghani et al 2020 rezaei 2021 rezaei and gurdak 2020 these works on teleconnections between climate indices and hydro climate variables not specifically drought across the country suggest on the whole that 1 iran s precipitation tends to be commonly higher during el niño and lower during la niña phases of enso 2 the negative positive phase of nao can result in the above normal below normal precipitation over iran and 3 the above below normal precipitation are overall coincided with the positive negative phase of pdo particularly in winter recently rezaei and gurdak 2020 reported that pacific based oscillations have a more powerful influence than atlantic based circulations on the variability in precipitation water level and soil moisture in the lake urmia watershed there are some shortcomings in the above mentioned works on iran s drought including 1 they only studied the meteorological droughts without considering either the agricultural or integrated droughts 2 they often used a limited number of irregular points stations across the country while this study uses a highly dense network of grid points regularly distributed overs the whole country 3 none of them investigated specifically the severe historical droughts teleconnection with different climate indices across the country 4 there is no clear consensus on the multiple interacting impacts from different climate indices on iran s drought while the integrated effects are usually more important compared to a single climate index notaro et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 and finally 5 they mostly used the simple correlation coefficient calculations without further analyses drought definition based on a single variable index e g precipitation soil moisture or runoff may not be adequate for reliable risk assessment and decision making hao and aghakouchak 2013 to my best knowledge no prior research has computed the integrated meteorological and agricultural drought index across iran this study attempts to use the multivariate standardized drought index msdi which probabilistically incorporates the spi and standardized soil moisture index ssi for drought characterization hao and aghakouchak 2013 2014 demonstrated that msdi is a reasonable model for incorporating multiple drought indices probabilistically here the possible links between the large scale climate indices originated from atlantic amo ao and nao and pacific enso pdo and pna oceans and msdi across iran are explored to better understanding of the driving forces of weather related disasters this paper specifically attempts 1 to determine the historical droughts from the 2485 grid points over the latest 38 years dating back to 1979 and to investigate their strengths and spatial broadness 2 to compare the multiple interacting controls of climate indices on droughts in comparison to the single index using the multiple coherence wavelet calculation between the two and three coupled indices and the msdi cluster series and 3 to use the continuous wavelet transform and both the local and global wavelet coherence for identifying the synchrony and coupling between the monthly times series of mdsi and ocean atmosphere oscillations if the relations between droughts and natural oscillations are completely assessed the prediction of future drought is therefore possible jiang et al 2019 understanding the nature of variability and coupling of both precipitation and soil moisture with climate indices aids to identify how droughts may respond to climate variability and their potential susceptibility to change wavelet analysis can serve as a tool to examine these localized patterns and transient features of hydroclimate cycles grinsted et al 2004 rezaei 2021 rezaei and gurdak 2020 while the wavelet transform enables examination of broad features such as drought at long time scales and fine features at short ones it is well suited for time series with temporal variations that are nonstationary have short lived transient components and features at different scales or have singularities carey et al 2013 however the novelty of this study is to show that 1 the integrated drought indices such as msdi can be successfully used in the regions with highly variable climatic and geomorphological conditions such as iran to identify the spatiotemporal severity and broadness of the historical droughts and 2 the drought teleconnections with ocean atmosphere circulations is a complicated phenomenon that would be better unraveled by multiple interacting of climate indices than single ones 2 iran s climate iran as the second largest country in the middle east has 82 million inhabitants and covers an area of 1 648 195 km2 the country has different climate conditions and annual precipitation rates fig s1 in supplementary information si in terms of the complex topography the mountain ranges alborz and zagros that border two extremely arid deserts of dasht e kavir and dasht e lut in central eastern iran the geographical position of sea gulf and land in the continent the atmospheric dynamics occurring on multiple spatial temporal scales and the broad deserts in iraq and saudi arabia to the southwest of iran raziei 2018 barlow et al 2020 the climate varies from mild and humid humidity of 83 on the southern coast of the caspian sea to warm and arid humidity of 31 in central eastern iran alizadeh choobari and najafi 2018 the highest amount of mean annual precipitation 1400 mm occurs on the south coast of the caspian sea i e caspian region while southeastern iran is a region that receives the lowest rain 75 mm in the country fig s1 the minimum annual temperature varies from 2 8 across northwestern iran zagros mountains and some parts of kerman province to 33 8 on the northern coasts of the persian gulf and the oman sea hadi pour et al 2019 given high spatial and temporal variability in precipitation the five climate regions of the country determined by raziei 2018 are used as a basis for the k shape clustering approach as explained in section 3 based on different precipitation time variability raziei 2018 classified the country into five distinct climate regions including western central northeastern central eastern northwestern and caspian fig s2 where each one has its own specific monthly precipitation variability although both western and central northeastern regions have the rainy season that usually commences in october and terminates in june the western receives higher annual precipitation rates than the central northeastern the central eastern region has a longer dry season and much smaller annual precipitation than the western region the northwestern region in terms of a relatively even distribution of precipitation year round has a much shorter dry season compared to the western region the caspian region covering the southern coast of the caspian sea is characterized by a relatively uniform rainfall distribution all over the year peaking in octobers raziei 2018 3 methodology fig 1 shows the simple flowwork of the methodology first the gpcc precipitation global precipitation climatology centre dataset monthly product version 2018 with 0 25degree spatial resolution was acquired for a highly dense network of regularly distributed grid points 2485 across iran fig 2 spanning from january 1979 to december 2016 this product version was prepared through monthly land surface precipitation from a maximum of 50 000 rain gauges per month built on gts based and historical data which is considered as the most accurate gpcc precipitation dataset schneider et al 2018 it is important to emphasize that the data from the 2485 points have uncertainties inherent in the data interpolation process although to circumvent interpolation artefacts the gpcc interpolation approach has been accompanied by a climatological infilling for areas where an entire 5 degrees grid has no any rain gages however spatiotemporal assessments of four gridded precipitation datasets of climatic research unit cru global precipitation climatology centre gpcc persiann climate data record pcdr and university of delaware udel against 85 synoptic stations for the period 1984 2013 by hosseini moghari et al 2018 indicated that gpcc is the most proper dataset to be used over iran and it can correctly recognize regimes of precipitation the combined product of daily soil moisture data from 1 november 1978 to 31 december 2019 were also downloaded from the esa cci sm i e european space agency climate change institute soil moisture product version 4 7 with 0 25degree spatial resolution dorigo et al 2017 the combined product is a blended product based on both scatterometer and radiometer products dorigo et al 2017 then the daily soil moistures were aggregated to obtain monthly values given the precipitation and soil moisture overlapped from january 1979 to december 2016 one can compute the drought index at each point second the msdi approach proposed by hao and aghakouchak 2014 that uses the empirical distribution function of the two variables was applied for the drought index estimate msdi incorporates the meteorological i e spi and agricultural i e ssi drought conditions for the overall characterization of drought the spi a single variable drought index proposed by mckee et al 1993 computes the probability of precipitation lack occurrence at a particular monthly time scale for spi computation a probability distribution function is first fitted to precipitation time series and the probability values are then rescaled through the inverse distribution function to finally obtain spi values cunha et al 2019 the ssi can be defined in a similar way to spi except that it uses the soil moisture data instead the precipitation a single variable index drought could not be sufficient for reliable risk assessment and decision making hao and aghakouchak 2013 cunha et al 2019 assuming the precipitation and soil moisture respectively as random variables x and y one can define the nonparametric joint distribution as follows hao and aghakouchak 2014 1 p x x y y p where p is the joint probability of precipitation and soil moisture here a nonparametric joint distribution is computed to avoid assumptions for the distribution family and to alleviate the computational burden for fitting parametric distributions hao and aghakouchak 2014 the empirical joint probability can be calculated by gringorten 1963 2 p x k y k m k 0 44 n 0 12 where n denotes the number of observations and m k is the number of occurrences of the pair x i y i for x i x k and y i y k given the empirical joint probability p msdi for each point is then computed as follows hao and aghakouchak 2013 3 msdi ϕ 1 p where ϕ is the standard normal distribution function msdi can characterize the drought condition at different time scales e g 3 6 12 and 24 months as an example the monthly soil moisture precipitation and msdi times series from an arbitrary point are shown in fig s3 here an integrated drought index i e msdi is used rather than one single variable i e index of either meteorological or agricultural because for the same drought event the meteorological drought may onset rapidly and terminate abruptly while the agricultural drought usually manifests with some time lag and persists longer heim 2002 mo 2011 hao and aghakouchak 2014 therefore pointed out that the meteorological drought is a better index for capturing the drought event beginning while the agricultural variable is more appropriate to detect the drought persistence one of the primary restrictions in drought monitoring is to apply a single index for identifying the diversity and complexity of drought situations wilhite 2005 while there are differences in the physical bases of different drought related variables such as precipitation and soil moisture hao and aghakouchak 2014 as one of the alternative tools the multi index approach is able to capture the higher aspects of the drought hao and aghakouchak 2013 cunha et al 2019 here the integrated drought index of msdi is therefore used it is computed using a matlab script http amir eng uci edu msdi php developed by hao and aghakouchak 2014 msdi incorporates the drought onset and termination in accordance with a joint impact of spi and ssi where onset being controlled by spi and drought persistence being more similar to ssi behavior the reliability of the msdi approach in characterizing drought conditions has been previously verified across the world hao et al 2014 as well as the us hao and aghakouchak 2014 further the msdi performance against both the single spi and ssi indices in detecting droughts over the nation is tested in fig s4 where msdi correctly mapped both the 1990 91 and 1998 99 drought patterns across iran of high climate and geomorphological variability the concurrent correlation estimates also show that the msdi time series is strongly correlated with both spi 0 87 on average ranging from 0 80 for cl16 to 0 92 for cl5 and ssi 0 79 on average ranging from 0 59 for cl4 to 0 89 for cl13 for all the 17 clusters fig s5 further shows the three spi ssi and msdi series from some clusters as an example consistent with hao and aghakouchak 2014 although the drought identified by msdi is more severe than those obtained from both ssi and spi for each cluster fig s5 the msdi by integrating the properties of both the spi and ssi can correctly capture the drought onset as an example 2007 08 drought in clusters cl7 cl10 and cl15 consistent with the spi and drought persistence corresponds to the ssi these observations show that the msdi can successfully monitor spatiotemporal drought conditions in iran so that it is used here to assess the teleconnections between drought and ocean atmospheric circulations similar to spi the five drought categories correspond to these thresholds of the msdi 0 5 to 0 7 abnormally dry 0 8 to 1 2 moderate drought 1 3 to 1 5 severe drought 1 6 to 1 9 extreme drought and 2 0 or less exceptional drought hao and aghakouchak 2014 subsequently the original msdi time series from 2485 grid points are used to extract the historical droughts as well as to provide the spatial shaded maps for droughts across iran as discussed in section 4 2 since the interpretation of wavelet analysis for a large number of time series is complicated the centroid msdi series of the 17 clusters cl1 to cl17 in table 1 and fig 2 is therefore used instead of the original monthly msdi from the 2485 points in addition to monthly msdi the accumulated 3 6 12 and 24 month time series is also computed for both climate indices and the msdi from each cluster to be used for the wavelet coherence analysis fig s6 as an example shows the 1 3 6 12 and 24 month time series for enso and the centroid msdi from cl1 note that here niño3 4 is used as a representative of the enso index for clustering all the 2485 msdi series are first classified into five clusters fig s2 in accordance with the classification presented by raziei 2018 that obtained from multivariate analysis on precipitation from a dense network of 155 synoptic stations to obtain a denser and more precise clustering each of the above five clusters are then categorized into 2 4 sub clusters using the domain independent highly accurate and highly efficient k shape clustering algorithm presented by paparrizos and gravano 2015 in addition to minimizing the sum of squared distances and generating homogeneous and well separated clusters k shape uses an iterative refinement procedure that is scaled linearly with the number of time series similar to k means k shape is the only scalable method that significantly outperforms k means owing to its distance measure i e shape based distance and centroid computation approach paparrizos and gravano 2015 k shape conducts two steps in each iteration assignment and refinement in the first stage the algorithm updates the cluster memberships by comparing each time series with all calculated centroids and allocating each time series to the cluster with the closest centroid the second stage updates the cluster centroids to justify the changes in cluster memberships made in the first step these two stages are repeated until either no change in cluster membership happens or the maximum number hear 100 of iterations allocated is reached the distortion function is used to select the appropriate number of clusters fig s7 shows the curves for distortion versus the number of clusters for all the climate region the optimal cluster number is a point of the elbow of the curve black flashes one can refer to paparrizos and gravano 2015 for more details of the k shape clustering approach third given the monthly centroid msdi series for each cluster and the monthly indices series during the 1979 2016 period the wavelet analysis was used to provide an indication of times and the period for which climate indices are teleconnected with integrated meteorological and agricultural droughts across the country the correlation coefficients were only calculated for the monthly series while the wavelet analysis is performed on all the accumulated 1 3 6 12 and 24 month series the wavelet analysis was carried out in two stages continuous wavelet transform and wavelet coherence the multiple wavelet coherence was further used to quantify the two and three coupled index s effect on drought the local continuous wavelet transform lcwt for a time series x n n 1 n with uniform time steps δ t that is defined as the convolution of x n with the scaled and normalized wavelet grinsted et al 2004 4 w n x s δ t s n 1 n x n ψ 0 n n δ t s ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e 0 5 η 2 where ψ 0 is the morlet wavelet the complex conjugate s the wavelet scale ω 0 dimensionless frequency and η dimensionless time in this approach 1000 randomly constructed synthetic series were generated by monte carlo methods to test the significance of the lcwt grinsted et al 2004 furthermore the global power spectrum gps as a function of time for each time series was also computed using a matlab script written by schulte 2019 the cumulative arcwise significant test 95 confidence bound was performed to assess the degree to which the power spectrum exceeds the background noise the local wavelet coherence lwtc r n 2 s for each pair of time series is calculated as follows grinsted et al 2004 5 r n 2 s s s 1 w n xy s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 s w s scale s time w n s where s w is a smoothing operator s scale smoothing along the wavelet scale axis and s time smoothing in time the cross wavelet transform w n xy s for each pair of time series i e x n and y n is defined as w x w y where is complex conjugation the global wavelet coherence gwtc is used to identify timescales reported in this paper periods of maximum time averaged power are characterized as the dominant timescale of variability the global wavelet coherence gwtc also referred to as time averaged wtc is defined as follows elsayed 2006 6 g c s w xy s 2 n 1 n w n x 2 n 1 n w n y 2 this equation computes the coherence between two time series in the entire study period at a scale s statistical significance of g c s is calculated using monte carlo methods first red noise time series of the same lengths and autocorrelation coefficients as the two input time series are generated and then g c s is calculated for each pair of red noise series the g c s distribution obtained for each scale is then employed to compute the significance of the global coherence schulte et al 2016 the multiple wavelet coherence is computed using the modified version of grinsted et al 2004 s code by hu and si 2016 first the matrix of smoothed cross wavelet power spectra between response variable y and multiple predictor variables x is defined as follows koopmans 1974 hu and si 2016 7 w y x s τ w y x 1 s τ w y x 2 s τ w y x q s τ where w y x i s τ signifies the smoothed cross wavelet power spectra between y and x i for scale s and temporal or spatial step τ then the multiple wavelet coherence ρ m 2 s τ is calculated by koopmans 1974 hu and si 2016 8 ρ m 2 s τ w y x s τ w x x s τ 1 w y x s τ w y y s τ where w y x s τ defines the smoothed cross wavelet power spectra between y and x i and w y x s τ is a complex conjugate of w y x s τ the monte carlo method is used to calculate multiple wavelet coherence at a 95 confidence level grinsted et al 2004 the red noise of all variables is generated 1000 times for each scale and time step by a monte carlo simulation hu and si 2016 here the integrated drought index is used for teleconnections rather than individual meteorological and agricultural droughts indicators as the integrated indices can better identify the variety and complexity of drought situations wilhite 2005 fig s8 further presents a comparison of the wtcs for the enso index and spi ssi and msdi series for the clusters cl7 cl8 covering the zagros mountains with the smallest thickness of soil calcareous lithosol across the country there are strong coherence patterns between enso and precipitation spi at two distinct periods of 2 7 and 8 year while the soil moisture ssi does not show strong coherence with enso at 8 year period and only has some narrow strong coherence patterns at 2 7 year period compared to both spi and msdi notably the presence of moderate to strong coherence between enso and precipitation karstic spring discharge and groundwater isotopic contents have been recently reported for the zagros mountains rezaei 2021 rezaei and saatsaz 2021 the ssi index cannot completely detect the teleconnections across zagros may rely on that the zagros mountains composed of hard limestone rocks with thin soil coverage in the karstic highlands with small soil coverage the surface bare land quickly dries in hours to several days after each rainfall events depending on its intensity and duration and air temperature it therefore seems that the soil moisture variable is not a proper indicator of drought to be solely used for teleconnection assessment across bare highlands in semiarid climates so that this paper uses the integrated drought index rather than a single indicator 4 results 4 1 msdi time series clustering as explained in the methodology the original msdi series from the 2485 points were classified into 17 clusters as listed in table 1 since the climate across iran is of high spatial variability however each cluster that is automatically obtained from unsupervised k shape clustering for each climate region includes those grid points that not only have approximately a similar climate but also adjacent to each other fig 2 reflecting the goodness of the clustering approach as an example the western caspian coast i e cl4 with very humid climate are successfully separated from the eastern caspian coast i e cl5 of sub humid climate consistent with the results from alizadeh choobari and najafi 2018 furthermore the high zagros i e cl8 with cool and sub humid climate are well separated from the low zagros i e cl7 of semiarid climate fig 3 illustrates that the 17 clusters correctly highlight the severe droughts of 1980 1985 86 1990 91 1998 99 2000 2007 08 and 2010 11 that occurred across iran from 1979 to 2016 these severe droughts the spikes highlighted by dashed boxes almost have large negative msdi values while the wet periods of 1983 1992 1997 98 2003 and 2015 16 the peaks highlighted by red boxes are of a relatively large positive msdi values over all the country on the other hand the historical enso time series show that 1998 99 1999 2000 2007 08 and 2010 11 are the years of strong la niña while the years of 1982 83 1991 92 1997 98 2002 03 2015 16 coincided with strong and very strong el niño furthermore fig 3 demonstrates that both enso i e niño and pdo were at large negative phases and nao was at its relatively large positive phase during droughts 2007 08 and 2000 this evidence hypothesizes that severe droughts may modulate by the large scale ocean atmosphere circulations this hypothesis is further analyzed in the following sections 4 2 spatiotemporal droughts and their link to climate indices unlike most climate variability studies that have examined the impacts of ocean atmosphere circulations on iran s drought overlooking the severe historical droughts possible multiple interacting impacts in terms of ocean atmosphere oscillations behind the severe droughts are explored for a better understanding of the driving forces of weather related disasters to further analyze and quantify teleconnections between climate indices and droughts the average values of msdi and climate indices are extracted and compared for each severe drought as shown in fig 4 a and 4b following a decreasing order of severity the historical droughts are 2007 08 2000 1990 91 1985 86 1998 99 2010 11 and 1980 based on the average msdis from 17 clusters fig 4a fig 4b further shows that both niño and pdo were in their relatively large negative phase during the four latest droughts 1998 99 1999 2000 2007 08 and 2010 11 pdo also was at its large negative phase during the 1990 91 drought while niño was at a relatively neutral phase i e close to zero over the two early historical droughts dating back to 1980 and 1985 86 both niño and pdo were at a neutral phase nao rather was at its relatively large positive phase during the droughts 2007 08 and 2000 which were extreme i e msdi of less than 1 3 across a broad portion of the country to visualize the distribution of the severe historical droughts across iran maps of drought severity i e msdi values for 1980 1985 86 1990 91 1998 99 2000 2007 08 and 2010 11 are exhibited in fig 5 interpolation is performed by the triangulation based linear approach defined in the griddata function of matlab the 2007 08 and 2000 droughts besides the largest negative msdis on average also had the broadest spread across the nation except for southeastern iran with a warm and arid climate and some parts of northern iran the whole country was at extreme drought msdi 1 5 over 2007 08 on the contrary the 1980 drought had less extensive spread across the nation fig 5 consistent with the weakest average msdi values in fig 4a 4 3 correlation between droughts and climate indices here the concurrent zero lag correlation coefficients between the climate indices and the wet season msdi series are computed from all 2485 grid points fig 6 a to 6f the wet season msdi values are only considered for correlation analysis because 1 precipitation over iran almost falls during the wet season containing october to december of the previous year and january to may of the next year as shown in fig s9 of each hydrological year 2 much of the country has no significant precipitation during the dry season and 3 the anthropogenic effects on soil moisture are at its minimum level during the wet season anthropogenic activities affect soil moisture commonly by converting natural vegetation coverage to agriculture and settlement coverage sterling et al 2013 irrigation that usually enhances soil moisture in the farmlands is at its highest rate during dry seasons in semi arid areas such as iran however the correlation coefficient between amo and msdi ranges from 0 49 in southwest iran and the northern coasts of the persian gulf and oman sea to 0 60 in the upper latitudes fig 6a particularly the northeast portion both ao and nao have approximately similar patterns of negative correlation with iran s drought fig 6b and 6c consistent with the results from the wavelet analysis in sections 4 4 and 4 5 the coefficients vary from 0 44 in northern iran to 0 35 at eastern borders for ao fig 6b and from 0 54 in northern iran to 0 27 in the central parts of the country for nao fig 6c overall nao has a larger correlation with the drought across the northern parts consistent with results from dehghani et al 2020 the nao drought correlation coefficient value obtained for the southwestern corner of the country from 0 25 to 0 35 is roughly equal to that value 0 30 computed by dezfuli et al 2010 for the khuzestan plain compared to other indices niño is a climate index that has the highest correlation with iran s drought consistent with the results for autumn and winter mostly wet season by dehghani et al 2020 niño correlation with iran s droughts is almost positive ranges from 0 10 to 0 65 0 32 on average and 0 4 blue colors over much of the country fig 6d particularly southwestern and northeastern iran and the persian gulf coast although in terms of the difference in methodology and spatial and temporal resolution of the used dataset the correlation map in fig 6d is not well consistent with that obtained by nazemosadat et al 2015 they both show that the highest correlation between enso and drought is related to southwestern and northeastern iran dehghani et al 2020 likewise concluded that enso modulates iran s precipitation in winter and springtime as a historical case extreme floods have occurred across southwestern iran during the strong el niño phase in the winter and spring of 2019 fig 6e shows that the correlation coefficient between pdo and msdi clusters ranges from 0 39 in the eastern potions to 0 54 in western parts there appears that the pdo influence on drought for western region is different from eastern one both niño and pdo have a relatively stronger influence on the persian gulf s coast and the southwestern parts of the nation the correlation coefficient between pna and droughts varies from 0 25 in the southeastern parts to 0 50 in central northern iran fig 6f pna has a positive correlation with drought across most parts of the country except for central southeastern iran overall the correlation coefficients between the pacific based indices and iran s drought tend to be mostly positive blue color in the maps of fig 6 4 4 continuous wavelet cwt figs s10 shows the lcwts and gpss for all the climate indices during 1979 2016 the atlantic based indices amo ao and nao have significant power regions at 8 year band this significant power region for amo is at two bands of 8 year and 16 year while for nao and ao it occurs at 10 15 year bands besides the three indices of amo ao and nao have other significant power regions around 1 year and 3 year bands both 8 year and 1 year power bands seem to be more important as they satisfied the cumulative arcwise significant test 95 confidence bound the pacific ocean oscillations especially niño and pdo show a higher power spectrum than other indices niño has three dominant power regions at 1 3 7 and 8 14 year bands that the first and second bands are more substantial in 1983 1990 1995 2000 and 2007 2016 and are coincided with severe droughts of 1985 86 1998 2000 2007 08 and 2010 11 over iran pdo is of two dominant power regions at 1 and 8 14 year bands the second power band that is more apparent after 1985 roughly coincides with the third mode of niño pna has a significant power region at the 4 8 year band particularly during 1980 1995 given the above evidence there are two common dominant periodicities in all considered indices 1 and 8 year the atlantic based indices further have a similar dominant mode around 3 year both niño and pna from the pacific ocean also have a similar dominant mode at 3 8 year compared to all modes the 8 14 year mode from pdo and niño is the most dominant one as it has the largest power spectrum value in fig s10 the second most dominant is the 3 7 year mode of niño however if iran s droughts connect to these indices msdi series could have similar dominant modes fig 7 reveals the lcwts and gpss for all 17 clusters over the 1979 2016 period the gps curves demonstrate that the two dominant periodicities of the droughts in northwestern iran i e cl1 cl2 and cl3 have occurred at two 1 and 4 14 year bands fig 7 approximately in the range of the dominant periodicities i e from 1 to 8 year of the indices the 4 14 year periodicity is more apparent over a time span from 1982 to 2010 the periodicities of cl4 and cl5 clusters in the caspian region not only are different from those of northwestern iran but also different from each other may owing to more complex teleconnections in addition to dominant periodicity at 16 year bands cl4 cluster western caspian sea coast also has three other dominant periodicities at 2 5 and 10 year consistent with the niño and pna indices the 4 8 year band is the dominant mode for the cl5 cluster eastern caspian sea coast the dominant mode for drought in western iran cl6 to cl9 is related to 10 14 year for cl6 and cl9 and 16 year for cl7 and cl8 consistent with interdecadal dominant mode i e 8 14 year of both nino and pdo the clusters cl10 to cl13 of central northeastern iran have a dominant mode of 3 8 year mostly over 1985 2012 that are more consistent with 3 7 year mode of niño and pna as well as with 3 year mode of the atlantic based indices notably fig 6 also shows that the highest correlation between niño and iran s drought is related to central northeastern iran dark blue color central southeastern iran with a drier climate cl14 to cl17 shows a dominant power region at 12 year band across the whole transect 1979 2016 corresponding to the longer dominant periodicity of most indices the cl16 and cl17 clusters southeastern iran have two other dominant signals at 2 year and 4 8 year bands based on the gps curves notably there are some significant patterns in yellow in most lwtcs for clusters at 1 3 year bands around 2007 2008 that is the most severe drought that occurred in iran as explained in section 5 4 5 wavelet coherence wtc this section first presents iran s drought teleconnections with atlantic based indices and then with pacific based ones in the lwtcs the less intense colors specify the cone of influence light line that is influenced by edge effects of the wavelet spectra colors indicate the strength of the coherence where yellow and orange areas within the thick black lines are significant at the 95 level against red noise black arrows are the phase angle identifying the phase relation between two series for which right and left directed arrows representing in phase and anti phase relations respectively holman et al 2009 note that on the right hand side of each lwtc its corresponding gwtc is also shown here the linkage between indices and all the accumulated 1 3 6 12 and 24 month msdi series is analyzed across iran although the obtained coherence patterns from all 1 to 24 month msdi series closely resemble each other the coherence patterns in the wcts from the 12 and 24 month series droughts are relatively more apparent than those from 1 and 3 month series the rest of the paper therefore focuses on the results from the 24 month msdi series for brevity as an example the results from the monthly msdi series are presented through figs s11 to s16 in si fig s17 shows the lwtcs and gwtcs between amo and msdi of the 17 clusters from the accumulated 24 month msdi the wtcs generally reveal that the highest coherence between amo and droughts at each specific cluster mostly occurs at the interannual bands of 8 year the coherence tends to be positive roughly left directed arrows particularly at the northern parts cl1 to cl3 and cl5 consistent with the dominant periodicity i e 8 year of the amo s cwts as well as the wet season correlation coefficient map in fig 6a northwestern iran cl1 to cl3 with mean significant coherence of 0 44 table 2 is a region that has the broadest at the lwtc and highest at the gwtc coherence with amo at the 5 9 year band during 1980 2016 this possibly results from the influence that amo has on temperature across northwestern iran abbasi and maleki 2017 rezaei and gurdak 2020 beyond the 8 year band another pattern with moderate to strong coherence between amo and droughts exists at the 2 4 year band in lwtcs of all clusters except for cl4 i e the western caspian sea coast compared to amo with mean significant coherence of 0 36 in table 2 ao with mean significant coherence of 0 37 shows a little stronger coherence with droughts across iran at two periodicity bands fig s18 4 8 year and 10 year at the 4 8 year periodicities the coherence tends to be negative while at 10 year periods there is a lag time down pointing arrows particularly at 10 year bands between ao and drought over most parts of the country overall ao has negative coherence with drought over iran ao generally has moderate to strong coherence with droughts for the majority of clusters in two dominant modes of 4 8 and 10 year at the gcwts although the significant coherence pattern at the 4 8 year band approximately exists at all clusters it is more significant at upper latitudes i e cl1 cl2 cl5 cl6 cl10 and cl12 with mean significant coherence of 0 40 in table 2 the lowest coherence between ao and drought is related to the western caspian sea coast cl4 with a small mean coherence of 0 30 and central eastern iran cl14 to cl17 with a small mean coherence of 0 29 0 33 the 10 year band coherence is distributed over the whole transect for all clusters except for the western caspian sea coast cl4 with the small mean significant coherence of 0 30 in table 2 and the high zagros cl8 with a small mean significant coherence of 0 38 in table 2 note that the 10 year band coherence is more evident in the wtcs from the monthly msdi series fig s12 with longer lengths compared to the accumulated ones such as the 12 and 24 month series nao and droughts across iran are almost correlated negatively consistent with the correlation coefficient map in fig 6c similar to ao fig 8 reveals that the lowest coherence between nao and droughts has occurred in the western caspian sea coast cl4 with mean significant coherence of 0 33 and central eastern iran cl16 and cl14 with mean significant coherence of 0 30 and 0 35 respectively furthermore there are also two regions of moderate to strong coherence at 5 significant level between nao and drought at 3 8 year and 10 year bands in most clusters the second significant coherence band corresponds to the 10 15 year mode of nao while the first coherence band is partially consistent with the 3 year mode of nao in section 4 4 the 4 8 year coherence band is more significant in western iran cl6 to cl9 with the highest mean coherence of 0 46 0 49 in table 2 and the upper latitudes such as cl1 cl12 and cl13 with mean significant coherence of 0 50 and cl12 with a large mean significant coherence of 0 48 roughly consistent with the wtcs results for ao the 10 year band coherence is distributed over the whole transect for all the country except for the caspian sea coast cl4 and cl5 overall ao and nao have roughly similar but relatively weaker impacts on iran s drought since in addition to their interconnection ao is the hemispheric equivalent of nao fig s19 this similarity is also demonstrated by correlation analysis in section 4 3 tabari and willems 2018 further reported that extreme precipitation over europe is modulated similarly by both ao and nao given these very similar impacts on iran s drought hereafter the rest of the paper only discusses nao ignoring ao after analyzing the atlantic based indices the teleconnections between the pacific based climate indices and iran s drought are then explored there appears that the droughts over iran are modulated by enso more than other indices since in addition to that the broadest coherence zones are observed in fig 9 compared to the wtcs from all the other indices niño among the single indices has the highest mean significant coherence of 0 57 on average table 2 the wtcs for niño demonstrate that the highest coherence exists in two bands of 4 7 year and 8 year is in well agreement with the dominant periodicities i e 3 7 and 8 14 year of niño there exist strong and broad coherence patterns for niño across the whole nation similar to the correlation map in fig 6d the strongest coherence is related to the northeastern parts cl13 with the largest mean significant coherence of 0 71 in table 2 and some parts of southeastern iran whereas the weakest coherence is attributed to the caspian sea coast cl4 and cl5 with mean significant coherence of 0 44 and 0 48 respectively and southeastern iran cl16 and cl17 with mean significant coherence of 0 46 compared to all the other indices results the 4 7 year mode between niño and iran s drought is the strongest coherence patterns reflecting that enso is the primary index affecting iran s drought notably the correlation coefficient between niño and iran s drought is mostly positive consistent with the correlation coefficient map in fig 6d comparing figs 9 and 10 demonstrates that the coherence patterns for pdo tend to be roughly similar to those from niño but with substantially smaller magnitude and lesser extent pdo has the strongest and broadest positive coherence with western half iran cl1 to cl4 and cl6 with mean significant coherence of 0 51 0 66 in table 2 compared to the rest country consistent with the correlation coefficient map in fig 6 consistent with enso patterns the coherence pattern is more evident in both the 4 7 and 8 year bands in all clusters although it is weaker for southeastern iran cl14 and cl16 with mean significant coherence of 0 30 furthermore the pdo and droughts coherence at 4 7 year bands tends to be positive different from the correlation coefficient obtained for eastern half iran may due to that the correlation coefficient is obtained from the annual values while the positive coherence here is attributed to the 4 7 year periodicity overall beyond the 4 7 year bands there are strong coherence patterns at the 8 year bands in all the wtcs i e both lwtcs and gwtcs from the 17 clusters that are consistent with the dominant periodicity of pdo explained in section 4 4 reflecting the relative effect that pdo has on iran s drought the coherence patterns for pna fig s20 are also roughly similar to those from both the niño fig 9 and pdo fig 10 where pna has strong coherence with droughts at both bands of 4 7 year at all clusters and 8 year the former coherence band is consistent with its dominant periodicity i e 4 7 year that is explained in section 4 4 while the second band is more consistent with the dominant mode of 8 14 year for niño and pdo indices the 4 7 year band s coherence at all clusters except for cl7 cl8 and cl9 tends to be stronger than the 8 year band s coherence where the former has moderate to strong coherence patterns at all clusters particularly before 2005 the moderate to strong coherence between pna and droughts at 8 year bands are broadly spread over all the country except for central iran cl10 and cl11 the coherence tends to be positive at 4 7 year bands consistent with niño and pdo indices 5 discussion among the obtained droughts of 1980 1985 86 1990 91 1998 99 2000 2007 08 and 2010 11 there appear the 2007 08 and 2000 droughts that occurred in the first decade of the current century to be the most intensive during the latest 38 years since they respectively have the largest negative msdis values fig 4a and the widest spread across the nation fig 5 likewise darand 2014 reported that the 2000 year was the most intensive meteorological drought across the country from 1950 to 2000 barlow et al 2016 also demonstrated that the 1999 2001 and 2007 08 were the most severe droughts that occurred over the middle east during the last 50 years recently using drought indicators of spi and spei nouri and homaee 2020 likewise observed that the 1998 2001 and 2007 08 droughts was the most severe droughts over the 1966 2012 period the extreme 2007 08 drought across iran was largely characterized by anomalous subsidence at 500 hpa over autumn winter and anomalous northerlies at 850 hpa over autumn spring coupled with anomalous high pressure around the caspian sea restricting the passage of midlatitude cyclones notaro et al 2015 overall msdi values fig 4a demonstrate that the droughts during the 2000 2016 period average msdi 1 14 were stronger compared to those over the latest 20 years of the 20th century average msdi 0 77 this issue highlights the fact that the influence of enso on middle eastern precipitation has become remarkably stronger in the most recent decades in part due to variations in the frequency and intensity of enso occurrences since the mid 1970 s rajagopalan et al 1997 comparing those severe droughts highlighted in fig 3 and the historical enso time series shows that 1998 99 1999 2000 2007 08 and 2010 11 were the years of strong la niña while the years of 1982 83 1991 92 1997 98 2002 03 and 2015 16 were coincided with strong and very strong el niño furthermore as an example during 2007 08 and 2000 droughts both niño i e enso and pdo were at large negative phases and nao was at its relatively large positive phase fig 3 on the other hand as explained in section 4 4 there are two dominant modes on the interannual 3 and 8 year for the atlantic based indices and 3 8 year for the pacific based ones and interdecadal 8 year scales in all considered climate indices similarly most msdi clusters have at least a dominant periodicity at 3 7 year over the period from 1982 to 1993 which is consistent with the interannual dominant modes of the indices particularly the 3 7 year mode of niño that is highly large compared to that of other indices fig s10 the second dominant mode in most msdi clusters also corresponds to the interdecadal dominant mode of the indices the above mentioned evidence hypothesizes that the severe droughts may highly modulate by multiple interacting indices rather than a single climate index such as enso as an example the severe 1980 and 1985 86 droughts across the country are not consistent with the la niña phase fig 4 is prepared to further analyze this hypothesis looking carefully at fig 4b niño pdo and nao seem to have relatively higher controls on the droughts compared to the other indices of pna and ao since both niño and pdo were in their relatively large negative phase over the four latest severe droughts 1998 99 1999 2000 2007 08 and 2010 11 very larger than the other indices further there is a footprint of nao over iran droughts but to a smaller magnitude compared to niño and pdo as nao was at its relatively large positive phase during the 2007 08 and 2000 droughts that were extreme across a broad portion of country however it also was at its negative phase over the 1990 91 drought fig 4a and 4b do not show a clear relationship between the droughts and other climate indices these results are further supported by the r squared values of the regression lines that are fitted to the average msdi based on 17 clusters from the severe droughts and the different climate indices r squared results reveal that nao r2 0 52 niño r2 0 42 and pdo r2 0 32 have the highest controls on droughts across iran respectively fig s21 the fitted lines are of a positive slope for niño and pdo and it is of a negative slope for nao this agrees well with various observational and modeling studies that have confirmed that la niña el niño events usually correspond to a positive negative nao like atmospheric anomaly pattern particularly over the late winter season e g brönnimann 2007 dehghani et al 2020 likewise pointed out that enso nao and pdo respectively have the most impact on seasonal precipitation not droughts over iran furthermore the significant correlations between enso and nao indices and hydroclimate variables across iran have been also reported in the literature alizadeh choobari and najafi 2018 ahmadi et al 2019 alizadeh choobari and adibi 2019 rezaei 2021 rezaei and gurdak 2020 our results are in contrast to those by mohammadrezaei et al 2020 who stated that amo is the primary climate index affecting drought across iran this discrepancy may result from that mohammadrezaei et al 2020 simply used the correlation coefficient at only 37 synoptic stations while in addition to the correlation coefficient for 2485 grid points the wavelet analysis is also used the wavelet analysis is more robust as it computes the coherence at different periodicities from monthly to multidecadal the r squared values for climate indices of amo ao and pna are less than 0 10 reflecting their lower modulation role in iran s drought the concurrent correlation results corroborate those achieved from the above since first the pacific based indices niño 0 57 on average in table 2 pdo 0 49 and pna 0 48 on the whole have a larger absolute correlation with droughts over iran compared to the atlantic based ones amo 0 36 ao 0 37 and nao 0 43 second droughts are generally correlated positively yellow color with pacific based indices and negatively blue color with atlantic based indices although amo has a positive coloration with drought across a broad portion of the country the wtc between the centroid msdi series from the 17 clusters and atlantic and pacific based climate indices also roughly confirm the above findings the wtc results from the atlantic based climate indices indicate that they particularly ao and nao mostly have negative correlations with iran s drought as the black arrows in the lwtcs are almost left directed tabari and willems 2018 likewise found that a negative correlation exists between both the ao and nao indices and extreme precipitation over turkey a northwestern neighbor of iran furthermore salahi et al 2005 and darand 2014 also suggested that nao has a negative weak correlation with iran s meteorological drought results also suggest that the influence of the atlantic based indices on iran s drought is generally higher in northwestern iran cl1 cl2 and cl6 the most upper latitudes the possible reason is that ao during its negative phase allows easier southward penetration of colder arctic airmasses and increased storminess into the mid latitudes noaa 2020 the other notable point is that both the nao and ao have the lowest influence on droughts over coasts of the caspian sea and the oman sea pacific based climate indices on the whole have a positive correlation with iran s drought right directed arrows in the lwtcs consistent with those reported by darand 2014 and rezaei and gurdak 2020 results also suggest that the influence of the pacific based indices particularly enso and pdo on iran s drought is higher compared to the atlantic based indices in terms of that in addition to the largest absolute correlation coefficients table 2 among the single indices niño and pdo to lesser extent pna show the broadest significant coherence patterns at the lwtcs figs 9 and 10 however it is observed that the niño and pdo have a relatively lowest impacts on southeastern iran cl16 and cl17 and the caspian sea coast cl4 and cl5 alizadeh choobari and najafi 2018 also reported that enso has the lowest correlation with precipitation in southeastern iran notably the wtcs between drought and niño fig 9 and to a lesser extent pdo fig 10 and pna fig s20 confirm the strong influence of the pacific based oscillations on the extreme 2007 08 drought over much the country since there is a strong coherence zone at 2 3 year bands of the lwtcs of the most clusters during 2007 08 the other notable point is that significant coherence between pacific based indices especially enso and pdo and iran s drought has mostly occurred at two bands of 4 7 and 8 year consistent with the dominant periodicities obtained from the cwt results fig 7 the 4 7 year mode lies in the enso s periodicity range 2 7 year and the 10 year mode lies in the pdo s periodicity range 10 25 year reflecting that the droughts across iran particularly the most intensive droughts emerge due to synergy between enso and pdo this is consistent with the second dominant band of 8 year at the lcwt of niño since fig s22 shows they both have strong coherence at the 5 significant level nazemosadat et al 2015 also found that during 1951 2005 the drier wetter periods occurred in iran when la niña el niño coincided with the negative positive phase of pdo notaro et al 2015 likewise argued that the combined la niña and negative pdo resulted in the drier soil moisture and higher dust across the fertile crescent largely containing iraq syria jordan israel and western iran wang et al 2014 also reported that the severe droughts across the fertile crescent are influenced by la niña coupled with cold pdo in terms of anomalous ridging across eastern europe and northern asia and subsidence over the fertile crescent itself furthermore both enso and pdo have strong positive coherence at 2 to 12 year and 18 year bands in the lwtc over the long term period from 1950 to 2020 fig s22 interestingly comparing the original msdi and niño times series also shows that the strong droughts in iran mostly occurred when strong la niña coupled with the largely negative pdo fig 3 notaro et al 2015 also hinted that the onset of the la niña phase may have triggered the later establishment of a cold pdo state particularly over 2001 2013 the mechanistic connection between enso and pdo is explained by newman et al 2003 and he et al 2004 overall the lowest teleconnections between climate indices and iran s drought are observed in southeastern iran cl14 cl16 and cl17 and the caspian sea coast cl4 and cl5 consistent with the results by nazemosadat and ghasemi 2003 and 2004 this possibly relates to the contribution of smaller scale climate regimes triggered by the indian ocean and the caspian sea for southeastern iran this may result from the high dry condition of this area with the lowest annual precipitation and the contribution of the indian ocean to the climate condition of the region nazemosadat 1996 on the contrary in the caspian sea coast with the warm temperate climate raziei 2017 the caspian sea along with the siberian high which is situated near the northern parts of the caspian sea modulates the weather condition of its southern coast nazemosadat and ghasemi 2004 reported that the strength of the siberian high changes the intensity of easterly oversea winds heading to the southwestern coasts cl4 during late autumn and winter zhang et al 1996 further claimed that the surface pressure of the siberian high and its corresponding 500 hpa trough and 200 hpa jet stream are weaker during el niño compared to the normal phase given this evidence the rainfall across the caspian region is highly affected by the siberian high enso phases and the sea surface temperature nazemosadat and ghasemi 2003 all the above evidence suggests that three coupled indices have stronger coherence with iran s drought than either two coupled or single indices to quantify this issue the multiple coherence is computed between the centroid msdi series from the 17 clusters and three coupled indices of niño pdo pna 0 87 on average in table 2 amo ao nao 0 87 on average and niño pdo nao 0 89 on average and two coupled indices of niño pdo 0 76 on average and niño nao 0 76 on average and single indices of amo 0 36 ao 0 37 nao 0 43 niño 0 57 pdo 0 49 and pna 0 48 furthermore the multiple interacting from the three coupled indices on the whole have a larger influence than both the two coupled niño pdo and niño nao or single climate indices of niño pna nao amo and pdo on iran s droughts as an example see fig s23 furthermore the three coupled niño pdo and nao has the greatest influence on iran s droughts the two coupled indices have higher coherence with droughts than single climate indices in all the 17 clusters among single indices niño has the highest effect on drought at most of the clusters except for the caspian sea coast cl3 and cl4 and southeastern iran cl16 and cl17 in which niño is the second important index table 2 and fig s24 the multiple interacting impacts from the three coupled niño pdo and nao are due to that the ocean atmosphere circulations usually arise from physically interconnected mechanisms according to the recent review by newman et al 2016 pdo is not a single independent phenomenon but rather results from a combination of physical processes through which the enso cycle interacts with extratropical variability to generate a red noise spectrum of enso like variability enso on the whole forces the pdo throughout the year as an example during boreal winter when el niño events peak the aleutian low deepens and the variations in the surface heat fluxes wind driven mixing and ekman transport in the upper ocean all interact to produce a positive pdo phase alexander 1990 on the other hand various observations and models have revealed that el niño la niña phases usually correspond to negative positive nao like atmospheric anomaly patterns particularly in winter e g mathieu et al 2004 brönnimann 2007 possibly because the north pacific s atmosphere acts as a pathway for enso related diabatic heating in the tropical pacific to modulate the atmospheric circulation patterns across the north atlantic e g graf and zanchettin 2012 zhang et al 2019 to physically understand how iran s droughts are partially modulated by niño pdo and nao indices it is to be noted that the sea surface temperature sst in the three particular regions of the equatorial pacific north atlantic and equatorial indian ocean can affect precipitation over the middle east and iran niranjan kumar et al 2016 notably the equatorial and atlantic ssts have a strong connection through the extension of the pacific enso signal into the atlantic e g li and lau 2012 lee et al 2013 the remote impact of enso on the middle east and iran precipitation is argued to be through the rossby wave trains from the equatorial pacific ssts niranjan kumar et al 2016 the phases positive or negative of the rossby wave pattern vary during el niño and la niña phases which further leads to a shift in the position of the jet stream over the middle east in the la niña el niño phase the middle east jet stream shifts northward southward resulting in weakening strengthening of the jet stream that could bring weaker stronger winter storms from the mediterranean region to iran niranjan kumar et al 2016 notably a negative positive pdo tends to enhance counteract and counteract enhance the la niña and el niño remote influences respectively in practice both jet stream and storm track i e moist air tend to shift poleward equatorward during negative positive pdo particularly in winters sung et al 2014 wang et al 2014 contributing to drier wetter conditions in lower latitudes such as iran wang et al 2014 further noticed that the la niña el niño coupled with positive pdo weakened deepened trough of low pressure that impedes accelerates the middle east jet stream resulting in a precipitation decrease increase in iran although nao s impacts on iran s precipitation is weak salahi et al 2005 during its positive phase the atlantic storm track tends to be northward and reaching western and northwestern europe resulting in a drier climate in the middle east cullen et al 2002 donat et al 2014 therefore the severe historical droughts across the country usually occurred when a strong la niña coupled with cold pdo and positive nao phases 6 conclusions droughts over iran have complex negative consequences both directly and indirectly particularly on water resources agriculture and food since so that 1 mm lack in precipitation relative to historical norm can lead to 90 million in losses this study provides evidence for the influence that large scale pacific and atlantic based oscillations have on the integrated meteorological and agricultural drought across iran the results are especially important for the severe historical droughts for which their teleconnections with large scale climate indices have been less known specifically 2007 08 and 2000 are distinguished to be the broadest and strongest droughts that have occurred across the country during 1979 2016 it is further observed that the severe droughts during the latest 21 years 1979 1999 of the 20th century are weaker compared to those over the early 17 years of the 21st century reflecting the strengthening impact that enso has on middle eastern climate in the most recent decades importantly findings here demonstrate that these severe droughts coincided with the strong la niña coupled with highly cold pdo and positive nao in fact multiple interacting impacts from the climate indices modulate severe integrated meteorological and agricultural droughts from computed msdi series over the 1979 2016 period it is distinguished that the severe historical droughts mostly correspond to strong la niña phases while the wet periods are likely associated with either very strong or strong el niño beyond enso the footprint of highly cold pdo and to lower magnitude positive nao are also seen in the severe droughts across the country overall the concurrent correlation results corroborate those results obtained from other analyses since first the oceanic atmospheric circulations of the pacific ocean have a larger correlation with iran s drought compared to the atlantic ocean second droughts are generally correlated positively with pacific ocean oscillations and negatively with atlantic ocean oscillations particularly ao and nao in the cwts the primary dominant periodicity of the droughts is occurred at 4 8 year bands for the northern parts cl1 to cl3 cl5 and cl10 to cl13 from west to east and at 10 year bands for the rest country from the wtc observations coherence between the pacific based indices and iran s drought is relatively stronger and more extensive compared to the atlantic based indices it is observed that amo shows a low coherence with droughts over iran at wtcs although in the concurrent correlation map it is moderately correlated with droughts across northern iran the coherence patterns between both ao and nao and droughts are relatively similar and stronger than those for amo nonetheless all the atlantic based indices show mostly anti correlation with iran s drought overall the atlantic ocean impacts tend to be higher at the upper latitudes of the northwestern and northeastern parts of iran the three indices of enso pdo and pna that originated from the pacific ocean on the whole are positively correlated with droughts over iran droughts have the highest positive correlation with niño since in addition to its highest mean coherence with iran s drought 0 57 among the single indices its wtcs also show the widest coherence patterns compared to other indices the coherence patterns for both pdo and pna are roughly similar to those from niño i e enso but to a smaller magnitude and lesser extent furthermore according to the wtc results and the correlation coefficient maps a substantial enso and pdo imprint is not seen in droughts across the southeastern portions and the caspian sea coast due to the contribution of surface water bodies of the caspian sea and the indian ocean on local climate conditions finally the three coupled indices have been identified as more important than two coupled or single indices for modulating iran s drought the enhanced understanding of the multiple interacting ocean atmospheric phenomena influencing the occurrence of severe droughts found here would be immensely helpful for improving drought prediction adaptation planning and disaster preparedness therefore this study suggests that considering the integrated impacts from the ocean atmospheric rather than two coupled or single indices is crucial for better understanding their teleconnections with hydro climate events and better predicting

4173,drought may affect more people than any other climate extremes worldwide especially in semi arid climates such as iran in this paper the empirical multivariate standardized drought index msdi that incorporates the meteorological and agricultural drought conditions is first computed the wavelet analysis is then used to identify teleconnections between ocean atmosphere oscillations from atlantic amo ao and nao and pacific enso pdo and pna oceans and iran s drought at a highly dense network of regularly gridded points 2485 during 1979 2016 it is found that among the droughts of 1980 1985 86 1990 91 1998 99 2000 2007 08 and 2010 11 both the 2007 08 and 2000 are the broadest and strongest across the country overall those droughts that occurred in the 2000 2016 period average msdi 1 14 were on the whole stronger than those happened over the latest 20 years of the 20th century average msdi 0 77 reflecting the strengthening of the influence that enso has on the middle east climate in the most recent decades according to the wavelet coherence results unlike the atlantic based oscillations that almost have an anti correlation with droughts there is a positive correlation between pacific based oscillations and iran s drought it is also identified that the severe historical droughts across the country were usually associated with a strong la niña coupled with cold pdo and positive nao phases in the latest 30 years overall droughts in iran tend to be substantially controlled by multiple interacting of climate indices since three coupled indices have stronger coherence with drought than either two coupled indices or single ones a combination of the three indices of enso pdo and nao has the strongest coherence with iran s drought compared to all the other three and two coupled and all single indices indicating that integrated impact of climate indices can better capture hydroclimate teleconnections these multiple interacting impacts from the different large scale climate circulation patterns mark a significant step towards an improved prediction of severe droughts across iran and can also be used for other parts of the world keywords iran s drought atlantic and pacific atmospheric oscillations integrated indices multivariate standardized drought index meteorological and agricultural drought 1 introduction drought as a climate extreme occurring over large spatiotemporal scales is the most costly natural disaster that can cause widespread impacts on water and food crises e g hao et al 2014 it affects more people than any other climate extremes worldwide wilhite 2005 particularly in the semi arid climates for iran as a highly water stressed semi arid country severe drought can have complex consequences from direct impacts on water resources crops food desertification and livestock to indirect impacts associated with sanitation nutrition loss of livelihood migration and international disputes the nation s agriculture industry is highly sensitive to droughts since each 1 mm deficit in precipitation relative to the historical norm is approximated to lead to 90 million in losses madani et al 2016 as an example mousavi 2005 reported that around 7 8 billion worth of damage occurred mainly in the agriculture sectoracross the country over the 1999 2001 droughts iran is prone to severe and sustained droughts owing in part to its geographic and climatological characteristics and semi arid climate fathian et al 2015 rezaei and mohammadi 2017 furthermore droughts are of crucial importance for risk assessment hazard preparedness sustainable development and better plan for future drought disasters and water resources management hao and aghakouchak 2013 2014 jiang et al 2019 this has prompted a concern to characterize the phenomena controlling droughts across the country drought is categorized into meteorological focused on precipitation agricultural focused on soil moisture hydrological focused on surface and groundwater and socio economical focused on drought impacts on supply and demand of some economic goods several types of research have examined the teleconnections between ocean atmospheric oscillations and meteorological drought across iran nazemosadat and ghasemi 2004 and nazemosadat et al 2015 reported that during the la niña el niño phase much of the nation tends to be drier wetter than the normal condition salahi et al 2005 found that north atlantic oscillation nao has a weak negative correlation with meteorological drought across northwestern iran raziei et al 2009 indicated however that although dry wet periods occasionally correspond to the la niña el niño phase of el niño southern oscillation enso a stringent correlation exists between the phenomena nikzad et al 2013 studied the teleconnections of enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo pacific north american pna and nao indices with meteorological drought i e standardized precipitation index spi at the abadan station in southwest iran dezfuli et al 2010 examined the link between enso and nao indices and meteorological droughts they reported that the statistical correlation coefficients between the wet season drought and southern oscillation index i e enso and nao equal to 0 5 and 0 30 respectively darand 2014 classified the country into four regions based on the palmer drought index and then examined the region s droughts correlation with several climate indices during 1950 2005 he found that iran s drought generally has a positive correlation with enso pna and pdo and a negative correlation with nao recently mohammadrezaei et al 2020 rather concluded that amo has the highest coherence with meteorological iran s drought using cross correlation analysis nouri and homaee 2020 pointed out that the la niña has a significant impact on droughts across the country through computing the correlation coefficient between enso and the drought indicators of spi and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei in addition to the drought it has been however reported that the ocean atmospheric oscillations partially can influence precipitation temperature runoff and spring flowrate across the nation e g nazemosadat and ghasemi 2004 nazemosadat et al 2015 abbasi and maleki 2017 alizadeh choobari and najafi 2018 ahmadi et al 2019 alizadeh choobari and adibi 2019 dehghani et al 2020 rezaei 2021 rezaei and gurdak 2020 these works on teleconnections between climate indices and hydro climate variables not specifically drought across the country suggest on the whole that 1 iran s precipitation tends to be commonly higher during el niño and lower during la niña phases of enso 2 the negative positive phase of nao can result in the above normal below normal precipitation over iran and 3 the above below normal precipitation are overall coincided with the positive negative phase of pdo particularly in winter recently rezaei and gurdak 2020 reported that pacific based oscillations have a more powerful influence than atlantic based circulations on the variability in precipitation water level and soil moisture in the lake urmia watershed there are some shortcomings in the above mentioned works on iran s drought including 1 they only studied the meteorological droughts without considering either the agricultural or integrated droughts 2 they often used a limited number of irregular points stations across the country while this study uses a highly dense network of grid points regularly distributed overs the whole country 3 none of them investigated specifically the severe historical droughts teleconnection with different climate indices across the country 4 there is no clear consensus on the multiple interacting impacts from different climate indices on iran s drought while the integrated effects are usually more important compared to a single climate index notaro et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 and finally 5 they mostly used the simple correlation coefficient calculations without further analyses drought definition based on a single variable index e g precipitation soil moisture or runoff may not be adequate for reliable risk assessment and decision making hao and aghakouchak 2013 to my best knowledge no prior research has computed the integrated meteorological and agricultural drought index across iran this study attempts to use the multivariate standardized drought index msdi which probabilistically incorporates the spi and standardized soil moisture index ssi for drought characterization hao and aghakouchak 2013 2014 demonstrated that msdi is a reasonable model for incorporating multiple drought indices probabilistically here the possible links between the large scale climate indices originated from atlantic amo ao and nao and pacific enso pdo and pna oceans and msdi across iran are explored to better understanding of the driving forces of weather related disasters this paper specifically attempts 1 to determine the historical droughts from the 2485 grid points over the latest 38 years dating back to 1979 and to investigate their strengths and spatial broadness 2 to compare the multiple interacting controls of climate indices on droughts in comparison to the single index using the multiple coherence wavelet calculation between the two and three coupled indices and the msdi cluster series and 3 to use the continuous wavelet transform and both the local and global wavelet coherence for identifying the synchrony and coupling between the monthly times series of mdsi and ocean atmosphere oscillations if the relations between droughts and natural oscillations are completely assessed the prediction of future drought is therefore possible jiang et al 2019 understanding the nature of variability and coupling of both precipitation and soil moisture with climate indices aids to identify how droughts may respond to climate variability and their potential susceptibility to change wavelet analysis can serve as a tool to examine these localized patterns and transient features of hydroclimate cycles grinsted et al 2004 rezaei 2021 rezaei and gurdak 2020 while the wavelet transform enables examination of broad features such as drought at long time scales and fine features at short ones it is well suited for time series with temporal variations that are nonstationary have short lived transient components and features at different scales or have singularities carey et al 2013 however the novelty of this study is to show that 1 the integrated drought indices such as msdi can be successfully used in the regions with highly variable climatic and geomorphological conditions such as iran to identify the spatiotemporal severity and broadness of the historical droughts and 2 the drought teleconnections with ocean atmosphere circulations is a complicated phenomenon that would be better unraveled by multiple interacting of climate indices than single ones 2 iran s climate iran as the second largest country in the middle east has 82 million inhabitants and covers an area of 1 648 195 km2 the country has different climate conditions and annual precipitation rates fig s1 in supplementary information si in terms of the complex topography the mountain ranges alborz and zagros that border two extremely arid deserts of dasht e kavir and dasht e lut in central eastern iran the geographical position of sea gulf and land in the continent the atmospheric dynamics occurring on multiple spatial temporal scales and the broad deserts in iraq and saudi arabia to the southwest of iran raziei 2018 barlow et al 2020 the climate varies from mild and humid humidity of 83 on the southern coast of the caspian sea to warm and arid humidity of 31 in central eastern iran alizadeh choobari and najafi 2018 the highest amount of mean annual precipitation 1400 mm occurs on the south coast of the caspian sea i e caspian region while southeastern iran is a region that receives the lowest rain 75 mm in the country fig s1 the minimum annual temperature varies from 2 8 across northwestern iran zagros mountains and some parts of kerman province to 33 8 on the northern coasts of the persian gulf and the oman sea hadi pour et al 2019 given high spatial and temporal variability in precipitation the five climate regions of the country determined by raziei 2018 are used as a basis for the k shape clustering approach as explained in section 3 based on different precipitation time variability raziei 2018 classified the country into five distinct climate regions including western central northeastern central eastern northwestern and caspian fig s2 where each one has its own specific monthly precipitation variability although both western and central northeastern regions have the rainy season that usually commences in october and terminates in june the western receives higher annual precipitation rates than the central northeastern the central eastern region has a longer dry season and much smaller annual precipitation than the western region the northwestern region in terms of a relatively even distribution of precipitation year round has a much shorter dry season compared to the western region the caspian region covering the southern coast of the caspian sea is characterized by a relatively uniform rainfall distribution all over the year peaking in octobers raziei 2018 3 methodology fig 1 shows the simple flowwork of the methodology first the gpcc precipitation global precipitation climatology centre dataset monthly product version 2018 with 0 25degree spatial resolution was acquired for a highly dense network of regularly distributed grid points 2485 across iran fig 2 spanning from january 1979 to december 2016 this product version was prepared through monthly land surface precipitation from a maximum of 50 000 rain gauges per month built on gts based and historical data which is considered as the most accurate gpcc precipitation dataset schneider et al 2018 it is important to emphasize that the data from the 2485 points have uncertainties inherent in the data interpolation process although to circumvent interpolation artefacts the gpcc interpolation approach has been accompanied by a climatological infilling for areas where an entire 5 degrees grid has no any rain gages however spatiotemporal assessments of four gridded precipitation datasets of climatic research unit cru global precipitation climatology centre gpcc persiann climate data record pcdr and university of delaware udel against 85 synoptic stations for the period 1984 2013 by hosseini moghari et al 2018 indicated that gpcc is the most proper dataset to be used over iran and it can correctly recognize regimes of precipitation the combined product of daily soil moisture data from 1 november 1978 to 31 december 2019 were also downloaded from the esa cci sm i e european space agency climate change institute soil moisture product version 4 7 with 0 25degree spatial resolution dorigo et al 2017 the combined product is a blended product based on both scatterometer and radiometer products dorigo et al 2017 then the daily soil moistures were aggregated to obtain monthly values given the precipitation and soil moisture overlapped from january 1979 to december 2016 one can compute the drought index at each point second the msdi approach proposed by hao and aghakouchak 2014 that uses the empirical distribution function of the two variables was applied for the drought index estimate msdi incorporates the meteorological i e spi and agricultural i e ssi drought conditions for the overall characterization of drought the spi a single variable drought index proposed by mckee et al 1993 computes the probability of precipitation lack occurrence at a particular monthly time scale for spi computation a probability distribution function is first fitted to precipitation time series and the probability values are then rescaled through the inverse distribution function to finally obtain spi values cunha et al 2019 the ssi can be defined in a similar way to spi except that it uses the soil moisture data instead the precipitation a single variable index drought could not be sufficient for reliable risk assessment and decision making hao and aghakouchak 2013 cunha et al 2019 assuming the precipitation and soil moisture respectively as random variables x and y one can define the nonparametric joint distribution as follows hao and aghakouchak 2014 1 p x x y y p where p is the joint probability of precipitation and soil moisture here a nonparametric joint distribution is computed to avoid assumptions for the distribution family and to alleviate the computational burden for fitting parametric distributions hao and aghakouchak 2014 the empirical joint probability can be calculated by gringorten 1963 2 p x k y k m k 0 44 n 0 12 where n denotes the number of observations and m k is the number of occurrences of the pair x i y i for x i x k and y i y k given the empirical joint probability p msdi for each point is then computed as follows hao and aghakouchak 2013 3 msdi ϕ 1 p where ϕ is the standard normal distribution function msdi can characterize the drought condition at different time scales e g 3 6 12 and 24 months as an example the monthly soil moisture precipitation and msdi times series from an arbitrary point are shown in fig s3 here an integrated drought index i e msdi is used rather than one single variable i e index of either meteorological or agricultural because for the same drought event the meteorological drought may onset rapidly and terminate abruptly while the agricultural drought usually manifests with some time lag and persists longer heim 2002 mo 2011 hao and aghakouchak 2014 therefore pointed out that the meteorological drought is a better index for capturing the drought event beginning while the agricultural variable is more appropriate to detect the drought persistence one of the primary restrictions in drought monitoring is to apply a single index for identifying the diversity and complexity of drought situations wilhite 2005 while there are differences in the physical bases of different drought related variables such as precipitation and soil moisture hao and aghakouchak 2014 as one of the alternative tools the multi index approach is able to capture the higher aspects of the drought hao and aghakouchak 2013 cunha et al 2019 here the integrated drought index of msdi is therefore used it is computed using a matlab script http amir eng uci edu msdi php developed by hao and aghakouchak 2014 msdi incorporates the drought onset and termination in accordance with a joint impact of spi and ssi where onset being controlled by spi and drought persistence being more similar to ssi behavior the reliability of the msdi approach in characterizing drought conditions has been previously verified across the world hao et al 2014 as well as the us hao and aghakouchak 2014 further the msdi performance against both the single spi and ssi indices in detecting droughts over the nation is tested in fig s4 where msdi correctly mapped both the 1990 91 and 1998 99 drought patterns across iran of high climate and geomorphological variability the concurrent correlation estimates also show that the msdi time series is strongly correlated with both spi 0 87 on average ranging from 0 80 for cl16 to 0 92 for cl5 and ssi 0 79 on average ranging from 0 59 for cl4 to 0 89 for cl13 for all the 17 clusters fig s5 further shows the three spi ssi and msdi series from some clusters as an example consistent with hao and aghakouchak 2014 although the drought identified by msdi is more severe than those obtained from both ssi and spi for each cluster fig s5 the msdi by integrating the properties of both the spi and ssi can correctly capture the drought onset as an example 2007 08 drought in clusters cl7 cl10 and cl15 consistent with the spi and drought persistence corresponds to the ssi these observations show that the msdi can successfully monitor spatiotemporal drought conditions in iran so that it is used here to assess the teleconnections between drought and ocean atmospheric circulations similar to spi the five drought categories correspond to these thresholds of the msdi 0 5 to 0 7 abnormally dry 0 8 to 1 2 moderate drought 1 3 to 1 5 severe drought 1 6 to 1 9 extreme drought and 2 0 or less exceptional drought hao and aghakouchak 2014 subsequently the original msdi time series from 2485 grid points are used to extract the historical droughts as well as to provide the spatial shaded maps for droughts across iran as discussed in section 4 2 since the interpretation of wavelet analysis for a large number of time series is complicated the centroid msdi series of the 17 clusters cl1 to cl17 in table 1 and fig 2 is therefore used instead of the original monthly msdi from the 2485 points in addition to monthly msdi the accumulated 3 6 12 and 24 month time series is also computed for both climate indices and the msdi from each cluster to be used for the wavelet coherence analysis fig s6 as an example shows the 1 3 6 12 and 24 month time series for enso and the centroid msdi from cl1 note that here niño3 4 is used as a representative of the enso index for clustering all the 2485 msdi series are first classified into five clusters fig s2 in accordance with the classification presented by raziei 2018 that obtained from multivariate analysis on precipitation from a dense network of 155 synoptic stations to obtain a denser and more precise clustering each of the above five clusters are then categorized into 2 4 sub clusters using the domain independent highly accurate and highly efficient k shape clustering algorithm presented by paparrizos and gravano 2015 in addition to minimizing the sum of squared distances and generating homogeneous and well separated clusters k shape uses an iterative refinement procedure that is scaled linearly with the number of time series similar to k means k shape is the only scalable method that significantly outperforms k means owing to its distance measure i e shape based distance and centroid computation approach paparrizos and gravano 2015 k shape conducts two steps in each iteration assignment and refinement in the first stage the algorithm updates the cluster memberships by comparing each time series with all calculated centroids and allocating each time series to the cluster with the closest centroid the second stage updates the cluster centroids to justify the changes in cluster memberships made in the first step these two stages are repeated until either no change in cluster membership happens or the maximum number hear 100 of iterations allocated is reached the distortion function is used to select the appropriate number of clusters fig s7 shows the curves for distortion versus the number of clusters for all the climate region the optimal cluster number is a point of the elbow of the curve black flashes one can refer to paparrizos and gravano 2015 for more details of the k shape clustering approach third given the monthly centroid msdi series for each cluster and the monthly indices series during the 1979 2016 period the wavelet analysis was used to provide an indication of times and the period for which climate indices are teleconnected with integrated meteorological and agricultural droughts across the country the correlation coefficients were only calculated for the monthly series while the wavelet analysis is performed on all the accumulated 1 3 6 12 and 24 month series the wavelet analysis was carried out in two stages continuous wavelet transform and wavelet coherence the multiple wavelet coherence was further used to quantify the two and three coupled index s effect on drought the local continuous wavelet transform lcwt for a time series x n n 1 n with uniform time steps δ t that is defined as the convolution of x n with the scaled and normalized wavelet grinsted et al 2004 4 w n x s δ t s n 1 n x n ψ 0 n n δ t s ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e 0 5 η 2 where ψ 0 is the morlet wavelet the complex conjugate s the wavelet scale ω 0 dimensionless frequency and η dimensionless time in this approach 1000 randomly constructed synthetic series were generated by monte carlo methods to test the significance of the lcwt grinsted et al 2004 furthermore the global power spectrum gps as a function of time for each time series was also computed using a matlab script written by schulte 2019 the cumulative arcwise significant test 95 confidence bound was performed to assess the degree to which the power spectrum exceeds the background noise the local wavelet coherence lwtc r n 2 s for each pair of time series is calculated as follows grinsted et al 2004 5 r n 2 s s s 1 w n xy s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 s w s scale s time w n s where s w is a smoothing operator s scale smoothing along the wavelet scale axis and s time smoothing in time the cross wavelet transform w n xy s for each pair of time series i e x n and y n is defined as w x w y where is complex conjugation the global wavelet coherence gwtc is used to identify timescales reported in this paper periods of maximum time averaged power are characterized as the dominant timescale of variability the global wavelet coherence gwtc also referred to as time averaged wtc is defined as follows elsayed 2006 6 g c s w xy s 2 n 1 n w n x 2 n 1 n w n y 2 this equation computes the coherence between two time series in the entire study period at a scale s statistical significance of g c s is calculated using monte carlo methods first red noise time series of the same lengths and autocorrelation coefficients as the two input time series are generated and then g c s is calculated for each pair of red noise series the g c s distribution obtained for each scale is then employed to compute the significance of the global coherence schulte et al 2016 the multiple wavelet coherence is computed using the modified version of grinsted et al 2004 s code by hu and si 2016 first the matrix of smoothed cross wavelet power spectra between response variable y and multiple predictor variables x is defined as follows koopmans 1974 hu and si 2016 7 w y x s τ w y x 1 s τ w y x 2 s τ w y x q s τ where w y x i s τ signifies the smoothed cross wavelet power spectra between y and x i for scale s and temporal or spatial step τ then the multiple wavelet coherence ρ m 2 s τ is calculated by koopmans 1974 hu and si 2016 8 ρ m 2 s τ w y x s τ w x x s τ 1 w y x s τ w y y s τ where w y x s τ defines the smoothed cross wavelet power spectra between y and x i and w y x s τ is a complex conjugate of w y x s τ the monte carlo method is used to calculate multiple wavelet coherence at a 95 confidence level grinsted et al 2004 the red noise of all variables is generated 1000 times for each scale and time step by a monte carlo simulation hu and si 2016 here the integrated drought index is used for teleconnections rather than individual meteorological and agricultural droughts indicators as the integrated indices can better identify the variety and complexity of drought situations wilhite 2005 fig s8 further presents a comparison of the wtcs for the enso index and spi ssi and msdi series for the clusters cl7 cl8 covering the zagros mountains with the smallest thickness of soil calcareous lithosol across the country there are strong coherence patterns between enso and precipitation spi at two distinct periods of 2 7 and 8 year while the soil moisture ssi does not show strong coherence with enso at 8 year period and only has some narrow strong coherence patterns at 2 7 year period compared to both spi and msdi notably the presence of moderate to strong coherence between enso and precipitation karstic spring discharge and groundwater isotopic contents have been recently reported for the zagros mountains rezaei 2021 rezaei and saatsaz 2021 the ssi index cannot completely detect the teleconnections across zagros may rely on that the zagros mountains composed of hard limestone rocks with thin soil coverage in the karstic highlands with small soil coverage the surface bare land quickly dries in hours to several days after each rainfall events depending on its intensity and duration and air temperature it therefore seems that the soil moisture variable is not a proper indicator of drought to be solely used for teleconnection assessment across bare highlands in semiarid climates so that this paper uses the integrated drought index rather than a single indicator 4 results 4 1 msdi time series clustering as explained in the methodology the original msdi series from the 2485 points were classified into 17 clusters as listed in table 1 since the climate across iran is of high spatial variability however each cluster that is automatically obtained from unsupervised k shape clustering for each climate region includes those grid points that not only have approximately a similar climate but also adjacent to each other fig 2 reflecting the goodness of the clustering approach as an example the western caspian coast i e cl4 with very humid climate are successfully separated from the eastern caspian coast i e cl5 of sub humid climate consistent with the results from alizadeh choobari and najafi 2018 furthermore the high zagros i e cl8 with cool and sub humid climate are well separated from the low zagros i e cl7 of semiarid climate fig 3 illustrates that the 17 clusters correctly highlight the severe droughts of 1980 1985 86 1990 91 1998 99 2000 2007 08 and 2010 11 that occurred across iran from 1979 to 2016 these severe droughts the spikes highlighted by dashed boxes almost have large negative msdi values while the wet periods of 1983 1992 1997 98 2003 and 2015 16 the peaks highlighted by red boxes are of a relatively large positive msdi values over all the country on the other hand the historical enso time series show that 1998 99 1999 2000 2007 08 and 2010 11 are the years of strong la niña while the years of 1982 83 1991 92 1997 98 2002 03 2015 16 coincided with strong and very strong el niño furthermore fig 3 demonstrates that both enso i e niño and pdo were at large negative phases and nao was at its relatively large positive phase during droughts 2007 08 and 2000 this evidence hypothesizes that severe droughts may modulate by the large scale ocean atmosphere circulations this hypothesis is further analyzed in the following sections 4 2 spatiotemporal droughts and their link to climate indices unlike most climate variability studies that have examined the impacts of ocean atmosphere circulations on iran s drought overlooking the severe historical droughts possible multiple interacting impacts in terms of ocean atmosphere oscillations behind the severe droughts are explored for a better understanding of the driving forces of weather related disasters to further analyze and quantify teleconnections between climate indices and droughts the average values of msdi and climate indices are extracted and compared for each severe drought as shown in fig 4 a and 4b following a decreasing order of severity the historical droughts are 2007 08 2000 1990 91 1985 86 1998 99 2010 11 and 1980 based on the average msdis from 17 clusters fig 4a fig 4b further shows that both niño and pdo were in their relatively large negative phase during the four latest droughts 1998 99 1999 2000 2007 08 and 2010 11 pdo also was at its large negative phase during the 1990 91 drought while niño was at a relatively neutral phase i e close to zero over the two early historical droughts dating back to 1980 and 1985 86 both niño and pdo were at a neutral phase nao rather was at its relatively large positive phase during the droughts 2007 08 and 2000 which were extreme i e msdi of less than 1 3 across a broad portion of the country to visualize the distribution of the severe historical droughts across iran maps of drought severity i e msdi values for 1980 1985 86 1990 91 1998 99 2000 2007 08 and 2010 11 are exhibited in fig 5 interpolation is performed by the triangulation based linear approach defined in the griddata function of matlab the 2007 08 and 2000 droughts besides the largest negative msdis on average also had the broadest spread across the nation except for southeastern iran with a warm and arid climate and some parts of northern iran the whole country was at extreme drought msdi 1 5 over 2007 08 on the contrary the 1980 drought had less extensive spread across the nation fig 5 consistent with the weakest average msdi values in fig 4a 4 3 correlation between droughts and climate indices here the concurrent zero lag correlation coefficients between the climate indices and the wet season msdi series are computed from all 2485 grid points fig 6 a to 6f the wet season msdi values are only considered for correlation analysis because 1 precipitation over iran almost falls during the wet season containing october to december of the previous year and january to may of the next year as shown in fig s9 of each hydrological year 2 much of the country has no significant precipitation during the dry season and 3 the anthropogenic effects on soil moisture are at its minimum level during the wet season anthropogenic activities affect soil moisture commonly by converting natural vegetation coverage to agriculture and settlement coverage sterling et al 2013 irrigation that usually enhances soil moisture in the farmlands is at its highest rate during dry seasons in semi arid areas such as iran however the correlation coefficient between amo and msdi ranges from 0 49 in southwest iran and the northern coasts of the persian gulf and oman sea to 0 60 in the upper latitudes fig 6a particularly the northeast portion both ao and nao have approximately similar patterns of negative correlation with iran s drought fig 6b and 6c consistent with the results from the wavelet analysis in sections 4 4 and 4 5 the coefficients vary from 0 44 in northern iran to 0 35 at eastern borders for ao fig 6b and from 0 54 in northern iran to 0 27 in the central parts of the country for nao fig 6c overall nao has a larger correlation with the drought across the northern parts consistent with results from dehghani et al 2020 the nao drought correlation coefficient value obtained for the southwestern corner of the country from 0 25 to 0 35 is roughly equal to that value 0 30 computed by dezfuli et al 2010 for the khuzestan plain compared to other indices niño is a climate index that has the highest correlation with iran s drought consistent with the results for autumn and winter mostly wet season by dehghani et al 2020 niño correlation with iran s droughts is almost positive ranges from 0 10 to 0 65 0 32 on average and 0 4 blue colors over much of the country fig 6d particularly southwestern and northeastern iran and the persian gulf coast although in terms of the difference in methodology and spatial and temporal resolution of the used dataset the correlation map in fig 6d is not well consistent with that obtained by nazemosadat et al 2015 they both show that the highest correlation between enso and drought is related to southwestern and northeastern iran dehghani et al 2020 likewise concluded that enso modulates iran s precipitation in winter and springtime as a historical case extreme floods have occurred across southwestern iran during the strong el niño phase in the winter and spring of 2019 fig 6e shows that the correlation coefficient between pdo and msdi clusters ranges from 0 39 in the eastern potions to 0 54 in western parts there appears that the pdo influence on drought for western region is different from eastern one both niño and pdo have a relatively stronger influence on the persian gulf s coast and the southwestern parts of the nation the correlation coefficient between pna and droughts varies from 0 25 in the southeastern parts to 0 50 in central northern iran fig 6f pna has a positive correlation with drought across most parts of the country except for central southeastern iran overall the correlation coefficients between the pacific based indices and iran s drought tend to be mostly positive blue color in the maps of fig 6 4 4 continuous wavelet cwt figs s10 shows the lcwts and gpss for all the climate indices during 1979 2016 the atlantic based indices amo ao and nao have significant power regions at 8 year band this significant power region for amo is at two bands of 8 year and 16 year while for nao and ao it occurs at 10 15 year bands besides the three indices of amo ao and nao have other significant power regions around 1 year and 3 year bands both 8 year and 1 year power bands seem to be more important as they satisfied the cumulative arcwise significant test 95 confidence bound the pacific ocean oscillations especially niño and pdo show a higher power spectrum than other indices niño has three dominant power regions at 1 3 7 and 8 14 year bands that the first and second bands are more substantial in 1983 1990 1995 2000 and 2007 2016 and are coincided with severe droughts of 1985 86 1998 2000 2007 08 and 2010 11 over iran pdo is of two dominant power regions at 1 and 8 14 year bands the second power band that is more apparent after 1985 roughly coincides with the third mode of niño pna has a significant power region at the 4 8 year band particularly during 1980 1995 given the above evidence there are two common dominant periodicities in all considered indices 1 and 8 year the atlantic based indices further have a similar dominant mode around 3 year both niño and pna from the pacific ocean also have a similar dominant mode at 3 8 year compared to all modes the 8 14 year mode from pdo and niño is the most dominant one as it has the largest power spectrum value in fig s10 the second most dominant is the 3 7 year mode of niño however if iran s droughts connect to these indices msdi series could have similar dominant modes fig 7 reveals the lcwts and gpss for all 17 clusters over the 1979 2016 period the gps curves demonstrate that the two dominant periodicities of the droughts in northwestern iran i e cl1 cl2 and cl3 have occurred at two 1 and 4 14 year bands fig 7 approximately in the range of the dominant periodicities i e from 1 to 8 year of the indices the 4 14 year periodicity is more apparent over a time span from 1982 to 2010 the periodicities of cl4 and cl5 clusters in the caspian region not only are different from those of northwestern iran but also different from each other may owing to more complex teleconnections in addition to dominant periodicity at 16 year bands cl4 cluster western caspian sea coast also has three other dominant periodicities at 2 5 and 10 year consistent with the niño and pna indices the 4 8 year band is the dominant mode for the cl5 cluster eastern caspian sea coast the dominant mode for drought in western iran cl6 to cl9 is related to 10 14 year for cl6 and cl9 and 16 year for cl7 and cl8 consistent with interdecadal dominant mode i e 8 14 year of both nino and pdo the clusters cl10 to cl13 of central northeastern iran have a dominant mode of 3 8 year mostly over 1985 2012 that are more consistent with 3 7 year mode of niño and pna as well as with 3 year mode of the atlantic based indices notably fig 6 also shows that the highest correlation between niño and iran s drought is related to central northeastern iran dark blue color central southeastern iran with a drier climate cl14 to cl17 shows a dominant power region at 12 year band across the whole transect 1979 2016 corresponding to the longer dominant periodicity of most indices the cl16 and cl17 clusters southeastern iran have two other dominant signals at 2 year and 4 8 year bands based on the gps curves notably there are some significant patterns in yellow in most lwtcs for clusters at 1 3 year bands around 2007 2008 that is the most severe drought that occurred in iran as explained in section 5 4 5 wavelet coherence wtc this section first presents iran s drought teleconnections with atlantic based indices and then with pacific based ones in the lwtcs the less intense colors specify the cone of influence light line that is influenced by edge effects of the wavelet spectra colors indicate the strength of the coherence where yellow and orange areas within the thick black lines are significant at the 95 level against red noise black arrows are the phase angle identifying the phase relation between two series for which right and left directed arrows representing in phase and anti phase relations respectively holman et al 2009 note that on the right hand side of each lwtc its corresponding gwtc is also shown here the linkage between indices and all the accumulated 1 3 6 12 and 24 month msdi series is analyzed across iran although the obtained coherence patterns from all 1 to 24 month msdi series closely resemble each other the coherence patterns in the wcts from the 12 and 24 month series droughts are relatively more apparent than those from 1 and 3 month series the rest of the paper therefore focuses on the results from the 24 month msdi series for brevity as an example the results from the monthly msdi series are presented through figs s11 to s16 in si fig s17 shows the lwtcs and gwtcs between amo and msdi of the 17 clusters from the accumulated 24 month msdi the wtcs generally reveal that the highest coherence between amo and droughts at each specific cluster mostly occurs at the interannual bands of 8 year the coherence tends to be positive roughly left directed arrows particularly at the northern parts cl1 to cl3 and cl5 consistent with the dominant periodicity i e 8 year of the amo s cwts as well as the wet season correlation coefficient map in fig 6a northwestern iran cl1 to cl3 with mean significant coherence of 0 44 table 2 is a region that has the broadest at the lwtc and highest at the gwtc coherence with amo at the 5 9 year band during 1980 2016 this possibly results from the influence that amo has on temperature across northwestern iran abbasi and maleki 2017 rezaei and gurdak 2020 beyond the 8 year band another pattern with moderate to strong coherence between amo and droughts exists at the 2 4 year band in lwtcs of all clusters except for cl4 i e the western caspian sea coast compared to amo with mean significant coherence of 0 36 in table 2 ao with mean significant coherence of 0 37 shows a little stronger coherence with droughts across iran at two periodicity bands fig s18 4 8 year and 10 year at the 4 8 year periodicities the coherence tends to be negative while at 10 year periods there is a lag time down pointing arrows particularly at 10 year bands between ao and drought over most parts of the country overall ao has negative coherence with drought over iran ao generally has moderate to strong coherence with droughts for the majority of clusters in two dominant modes of 4 8 and 10 year at the gcwts although the significant coherence pattern at the 4 8 year band approximately exists at all clusters it is more significant at upper latitudes i e cl1 cl2 cl5 cl6 cl10 and cl12 with mean significant coherence of 0 40 in table 2 the lowest coherence between ao and drought is related to the western caspian sea coast cl4 with a small mean coherence of 0 30 and central eastern iran cl14 to cl17 with a small mean coherence of 0 29 0 33 the 10 year band coherence is distributed over the whole transect for all clusters except for the western caspian sea coast cl4 with the small mean significant coherence of 0 30 in table 2 and the high zagros cl8 with a small mean significant coherence of 0 38 in table 2 note that the 10 year band coherence is more evident in the wtcs from the monthly msdi series fig s12 with longer lengths compared to the accumulated ones such as the 12 and 24 month series nao and droughts across iran are almost correlated negatively consistent with the correlation coefficient map in fig 6c similar to ao fig 8 reveals that the lowest coherence between nao and droughts has occurred in the western caspian sea coast cl4 with mean significant coherence of 0 33 and central eastern iran cl16 and cl14 with mean significant coherence of 0 30 and 0 35 respectively furthermore there are also two regions of moderate to strong coherence at 5 significant level between nao and drought at 3 8 year and 10 year bands in most clusters the second significant coherence band corresponds to the 10 15 year mode of nao while the first coherence band is partially consistent with the 3 year mode of nao in section 4 4 the 4 8 year coherence band is more significant in western iran cl6 to cl9 with the highest mean coherence of 0 46 0 49 in table 2 and the upper latitudes such as cl1 cl12 and cl13 with mean significant coherence of 0 50 and cl12 with a large mean significant coherence of 0 48 roughly consistent with the wtcs results for ao the 10 year band coherence is distributed over the whole transect for all the country except for the caspian sea coast cl4 and cl5 overall ao and nao have roughly similar but relatively weaker impacts on iran s drought since in addition to their interconnection ao is the hemispheric equivalent of nao fig s19 this similarity is also demonstrated by correlation analysis in section 4 3 tabari and willems 2018 further reported that extreme precipitation over europe is modulated similarly by both ao and nao given these very similar impacts on iran s drought hereafter the rest of the paper only discusses nao ignoring ao after analyzing the atlantic based indices the teleconnections between the pacific based climate indices and iran s drought are then explored there appears that the droughts over iran are modulated by enso more than other indices since in addition to that the broadest coherence zones are observed in fig 9 compared to the wtcs from all the other indices niño among the single indices has the highest mean significant coherence of 0 57 on average table 2 the wtcs for niño demonstrate that the highest coherence exists in two bands of 4 7 year and 8 year is in well agreement with the dominant periodicities i e 3 7 and 8 14 year of niño there exist strong and broad coherence patterns for niño across the whole nation similar to the correlation map in fig 6d the strongest coherence is related to the northeastern parts cl13 with the largest mean significant coherence of 0 71 in table 2 and some parts of southeastern iran whereas the weakest coherence is attributed to the caspian sea coast cl4 and cl5 with mean significant coherence of 0 44 and 0 48 respectively and southeastern iran cl16 and cl17 with mean significant coherence of 0 46 compared to all the other indices results the 4 7 year mode between niño and iran s drought is the strongest coherence patterns reflecting that enso is the primary index affecting iran s drought notably the correlation coefficient between niño and iran s drought is mostly positive consistent with the correlation coefficient map in fig 6d comparing figs 9 and 10 demonstrates that the coherence patterns for pdo tend to be roughly similar to those from niño but with substantially smaller magnitude and lesser extent pdo has the strongest and broadest positive coherence with western half iran cl1 to cl4 and cl6 with mean significant coherence of 0 51 0 66 in table 2 compared to the rest country consistent with the correlation coefficient map in fig 6 consistent with enso patterns the coherence pattern is more evident in both the 4 7 and 8 year bands in all clusters although it is weaker for southeastern iran cl14 and cl16 with mean significant coherence of 0 30 furthermore the pdo and droughts coherence at 4 7 year bands tends to be positive different from the correlation coefficient obtained for eastern half iran may due to that the correlation coefficient is obtained from the annual values while the positive coherence here is attributed to the 4 7 year periodicity overall beyond the 4 7 year bands there are strong coherence patterns at the 8 year bands in all the wtcs i e both lwtcs and gwtcs from the 17 clusters that are consistent with the dominant periodicity of pdo explained in section 4 4 reflecting the relative effect that pdo has on iran s drought the coherence patterns for pna fig s20 are also roughly similar to those from both the niño fig 9 and pdo fig 10 where pna has strong coherence with droughts at both bands of 4 7 year at all clusters and 8 year the former coherence band is consistent with its dominant periodicity i e 4 7 year that is explained in section 4 4 while the second band is more consistent with the dominant mode of 8 14 year for niño and pdo indices the 4 7 year band s coherence at all clusters except for cl7 cl8 and cl9 tends to be stronger than the 8 year band s coherence where the former has moderate to strong coherence patterns at all clusters particularly before 2005 the moderate to strong coherence between pna and droughts at 8 year bands are broadly spread over all the country except for central iran cl10 and cl11 the coherence tends to be positive at 4 7 year bands consistent with niño and pdo indices 5 discussion among the obtained droughts of 1980 1985 86 1990 91 1998 99 2000 2007 08 and 2010 11 there appear the 2007 08 and 2000 droughts that occurred in the first decade of the current century to be the most intensive during the latest 38 years since they respectively have the largest negative msdis values fig 4a and the widest spread across the nation fig 5 likewise darand 2014 reported that the 2000 year was the most intensive meteorological drought across the country from 1950 to 2000 barlow et al 2016 also demonstrated that the 1999 2001 and 2007 08 were the most severe droughts that occurred over the middle east during the last 50 years recently using drought indicators of spi and spei nouri and homaee 2020 likewise observed that the 1998 2001 and 2007 08 droughts was the most severe droughts over the 1966 2012 period the extreme 2007 08 drought across iran was largely characterized by anomalous subsidence at 500 hpa over autumn winter and anomalous northerlies at 850 hpa over autumn spring coupled with anomalous high pressure around the caspian sea restricting the passage of midlatitude cyclones notaro et al 2015 overall msdi values fig 4a demonstrate that the droughts during the 2000 2016 period average msdi 1 14 were stronger compared to those over the latest 20 years of the 20th century average msdi 0 77 this issue highlights the fact that the influence of enso on middle eastern precipitation has become remarkably stronger in the most recent decades in part due to variations in the frequency and intensity of enso occurrences since the mid 1970 s rajagopalan et al 1997 comparing those severe droughts highlighted in fig 3 and the historical enso time series shows that 1998 99 1999 2000 2007 08 and 2010 11 were the years of strong la niña while the years of 1982 83 1991 92 1997 98 2002 03 and 2015 16 were coincided with strong and very strong el niño furthermore as an example during 2007 08 and 2000 droughts both niño i e enso and pdo were at large negative phases and nao was at its relatively large positive phase fig 3 on the other hand as explained in section 4 4 there are two dominant modes on the interannual 3 and 8 year for the atlantic based indices and 3 8 year for the pacific based ones and interdecadal 8 year scales in all considered climate indices similarly most msdi clusters have at least a dominant periodicity at 3 7 year over the period from 1982 to 1993 which is consistent with the interannual dominant modes of the indices particularly the 3 7 year mode of niño that is highly large compared to that of other indices fig s10 the second dominant mode in most msdi clusters also corresponds to the interdecadal dominant mode of the indices the above mentioned evidence hypothesizes that the severe droughts may highly modulate by multiple interacting indices rather than a single climate index such as enso as an example the severe 1980 and 1985 86 droughts across the country are not consistent with the la niña phase fig 4 is prepared to further analyze this hypothesis looking carefully at fig 4b niño pdo and nao seem to have relatively higher controls on the droughts compared to the other indices of pna and ao since both niño and pdo were in their relatively large negative phase over the four latest severe droughts 1998 99 1999 2000 2007 08 and 2010 11 very larger than the other indices further there is a footprint of nao over iran droughts but to a smaller magnitude compared to niño and pdo as nao was at its relatively large positive phase during the 2007 08 and 2000 droughts that were extreme across a broad portion of country however it also was at its negative phase over the 1990 91 drought fig 4a and 4b do not show a clear relationship between the droughts and other climate indices these results are further supported by the r squared values of the regression lines that are fitted to the average msdi based on 17 clusters from the severe droughts and the different climate indices r squared results reveal that nao r2 0 52 niño r2 0 42 and pdo r2 0 32 have the highest controls on droughts across iran respectively fig s21 the fitted lines are of a positive slope for niño and pdo and it is of a negative slope for nao this agrees well with various observational and modeling studies that have confirmed that la niña el niño events usually correspond to a positive negative nao like atmospheric anomaly pattern particularly over the late winter season e g brönnimann 2007 dehghani et al 2020 likewise pointed out that enso nao and pdo respectively have the most impact on seasonal precipitation not droughts over iran furthermore the significant correlations between enso and nao indices and hydroclimate variables across iran have been also reported in the literature alizadeh choobari and najafi 2018 ahmadi et al 2019 alizadeh choobari and adibi 2019 rezaei 2021 rezaei and gurdak 2020 our results are in contrast to those by mohammadrezaei et al 2020 who stated that amo is the primary climate index affecting drought across iran this discrepancy may result from that mohammadrezaei et al 2020 simply used the correlation coefficient at only 37 synoptic stations while in addition to the correlation coefficient for 2485 grid points the wavelet analysis is also used the wavelet analysis is more robust as it computes the coherence at different periodicities from monthly to multidecadal the r squared values for climate indices of amo ao and pna are less than 0 10 reflecting their lower modulation role in iran s drought the concurrent correlation results corroborate those achieved from the above since first the pacific based indices niño 0 57 on average in table 2 pdo 0 49 and pna 0 48 on the whole have a larger absolute correlation with droughts over iran compared to the atlantic based ones amo 0 36 ao 0 37 and nao 0 43 second droughts are generally correlated positively yellow color with pacific based indices and negatively blue color with atlantic based indices although amo has a positive coloration with drought across a broad portion of the country the wtc between the centroid msdi series from the 17 clusters and atlantic and pacific based climate indices also roughly confirm the above findings the wtc results from the atlantic based climate indices indicate that they particularly ao and nao mostly have negative correlations with iran s drought as the black arrows in the lwtcs are almost left directed tabari and willems 2018 likewise found that a negative correlation exists between both the ao and nao indices and extreme precipitation over turkey a northwestern neighbor of iran furthermore salahi et al 2005 and darand 2014 also suggested that nao has a negative weak correlation with iran s meteorological drought results also suggest that the influence of the atlantic based indices on iran s drought is generally higher in northwestern iran cl1 cl2 and cl6 the most upper latitudes the possible reason is that ao during its negative phase allows easier southward penetration of colder arctic airmasses and increased storminess into the mid latitudes noaa 2020 the other notable point is that both the nao and ao have the lowest influence on droughts over coasts of the caspian sea and the oman sea pacific based climate indices on the whole have a positive correlation with iran s drought right directed arrows in the lwtcs consistent with those reported by darand 2014 and rezaei and gurdak 2020 results also suggest that the influence of the pacific based indices particularly enso and pdo on iran s drought is higher compared to the atlantic based indices in terms of that in addition to the largest absolute correlation coefficients table 2 among the single indices niño and pdo to lesser extent pna show the broadest significant coherence patterns at the lwtcs figs 9 and 10 however it is observed that the niño and pdo have a relatively lowest impacts on southeastern iran cl16 and cl17 and the caspian sea coast cl4 and cl5 alizadeh choobari and najafi 2018 also reported that enso has the lowest correlation with precipitation in southeastern iran notably the wtcs between drought and niño fig 9 and to a lesser extent pdo fig 10 and pna fig s20 confirm the strong influence of the pacific based oscillations on the extreme 2007 08 drought over much the country since there is a strong coherence zone at 2 3 year bands of the lwtcs of the most clusters during 2007 08 the other notable point is that significant coherence between pacific based indices especially enso and pdo and iran s drought has mostly occurred at two bands of 4 7 and 8 year consistent with the dominant periodicities obtained from the cwt results fig 7 the 4 7 year mode lies in the enso s periodicity range 2 7 year and the 10 year mode lies in the pdo s periodicity range 10 25 year reflecting that the droughts across iran particularly the most intensive droughts emerge due to synergy between enso and pdo this is consistent with the second dominant band of 8 year at the lcwt of niño since fig s22 shows they both have strong coherence at the 5 significant level nazemosadat et al 2015 also found that during 1951 2005 the drier wetter periods occurred in iran when la niña el niño coincided with the negative positive phase of pdo notaro et al 2015 likewise argued that the combined la niña and negative pdo resulted in the drier soil moisture and higher dust across the fertile crescent largely containing iraq syria jordan israel and western iran wang et al 2014 also reported that the severe droughts across the fertile crescent are influenced by la niña coupled with cold pdo in terms of anomalous ridging across eastern europe and northern asia and subsidence over the fertile crescent itself furthermore both enso and pdo have strong positive coherence at 2 to 12 year and 18 year bands in the lwtc over the long term period from 1950 to 2020 fig s22 interestingly comparing the original msdi and niño times series also shows that the strong droughts in iran mostly occurred when strong la niña coupled with the largely negative pdo fig 3 notaro et al 2015 also hinted that the onset of the la niña phase may have triggered the later establishment of a cold pdo state particularly over 2001 2013 the mechanistic connection between enso and pdo is explained by newman et al 2003 and he et al 2004 overall the lowest teleconnections between climate indices and iran s drought are observed in southeastern iran cl14 cl16 and cl17 and the caspian sea coast cl4 and cl5 consistent with the results by nazemosadat and ghasemi 2003 and 2004 this possibly relates to the contribution of smaller scale climate regimes triggered by the indian ocean and the caspian sea for southeastern iran this may result from the high dry condition of this area with the lowest annual precipitation and the contribution of the indian ocean to the climate condition of the region nazemosadat 1996 on the contrary in the caspian sea coast with the warm temperate climate raziei 2017 the caspian sea along with the siberian high which is situated near the northern parts of the caspian sea modulates the weather condition of its southern coast nazemosadat and ghasemi 2004 reported that the strength of the siberian high changes the intensity of easterly oversea winds heading to the southwestern coasts cl4 during late autumn and winter zhang et al 1996 further claimed that the surface pressure of the siberian high and its corresponding 500 hpa trough and 200 hpa jet stream are weaker during el niño compared to the normal phase given this evidence the rainfall across the caspian region is highly affected by the siberian high enso phases and the sea surface temperature nazemosadat and ghasemi 2003 all the above evidence suggests that three coupled indices have stronger coherence with iran s drought than either two coupled or single indices to quantify this issue the multiple coherence is computed between the centroid msdi series from the 17 clusters and three coupled indices of niño pdo pna 0 87 on average in table 2 amo ao nao 0 87 on average and niño pdo nao 0 89 on average and two coupled indices of niño pdo 0 76 on average and niño nao 0 76 on average and single indices of amo 0 36 ao 0 37 nao 0 43 niño 0 57 pdo 0 49 and pna 0 48 furthermore the multiple interacting from the three coupled indices on the whole have a larger influence than both the two coupled niño pdo and niño nao or single climate indices of niño pna nao amo and pdo on iran s droughts as an example see fig s23 furthermore the three coupled niño pdo and nao has the greatest influence on iran s droughts the two coupled indices have higher coherence with droughts than single climate indices in all the 17 clusters among single indices niño has the highest effect on drought at most of the clusters except for the caspian sea coast cl3 and cl4 and southeastern iran cl16 and cl17 in which niño is the second important index table 2 and fig s24 the multiple interacting impacts from the three coupled niño pdo and nao are due to that the ocean atmosphere circulations usually arise from physically interconnected mechanisms according to the recent review by newman et al 2016 pdo is not a single independent phenomenon but rather results from a combination of physical processes through which the enso cycle interacts with extratropical variability to generate a red noise spectrum of enso like variability enso on the whole forces the pdo throughout the year as an example during boreal winter when el niño events peak the aleutian low deepens and the variations in the surface heat fluxes wind driven mixing and ekman transport in the upper ocean all interact to produce a positive pdo phase alexander 1990 on the other hand various observations and models have revealed that el niño la niña phases usually correspond to negative positive nao like atmospheric anomaly patterns particularly in winter e g mathieu et al 2004 brönnimann 2007 possibly because the north pacific s atmosphere acts as a pathway for enso related diabatic heating in the tropical pacific to modulate the atmospheric circulation patterns across the north atlantic e g graf and zanchettin 2012 zhang et al 2019 to physically understand how iran s droughts are partially modulated by niño pdo and nao indices it is to be noted that the sea surface temperature sst in the three particular regions of the equatorial pacific north atlantic and equatorial indian ocean can affect precipitation over the middle east and iran niranjan kumar et al 2016 notably the equatorial and atlantic ssts have a strong connection through the extension of the pacific enso signal into the atlantic e g li and lau 2012 lee et al 2013 the remote impact of enso on the middle east and iran precipitation is argued to be through the rossby wave trains from the equatorial pacific ssts niranjan kumar et al 2016 the phases positive or negative of the rossby wave pattern vary during el niño and la niña phases which further leads to a shift in the position of the jet stream over the middle east in the la niña el niño phase the middle east jet stream shifts northward southward resulting in weakening strengthening of the jet stream that could bring weaker stronger winter storms from the mediterranean region to iran niranjan kumar et al 2016 notably a negative positive pdo tends to enhance counteract and counteract enhance the la niña and el niño remote influences respectively in practice both jet stream and storm track i e moist air tend to shift poleward equatorward during negative positive pdo particularly in winters sung et al 2014 wang et al 2014 contributing to drier wetter conditions in lower latitudes such as iran wang et al 2014 further noticed that the la niña el niño coupled with positive pdo weakened deepened trough of low pressure that impedes accelerates the middle east jet stream resulting in a precipitation decrease increase in iran although nao s impacts on iran s precipitation is weak salahi et al 2005 during its positive phase the atlantic storm track tends to be northward and reaching western and northwestern europe resulting in a drier climate in the middle east cullen et al 2002 donat et al 2014 therefore the severe historical droughts across the country usually occurred when a strong la niña coupled with cold pdo and positive nao phases 6 conclusions droughts over iran have complex negative consequences both directly and indirectly particularly on water resources agriculture and food since so that 1 mm lack in precipitation relative to historical norm can lead to 90 million in losses this study provides evidence for the influence that large scale pacific and atlantic based oscillations have on the integrated meteorological and agricultural drought across iran the results are especially important for the severe historical droughts for which their teleconnections with large scale climate indices have been less known specifically 2007 08 and 2000 are distinguished to be the broadest and strongest droughts that have occurred across the country during 1979 2016 it is further observed that the severe droughts during the latest 21 years 1979 1999 of the 20th century are weaker compared to those over the early 17 years of the 21st century reflecting the strengthening impact that enso has on middle eastern climate in the most recent decades importantly findings here demonstrate that these severe droughts coincided with the strong la niña coupled with highly cold pdo and positive nao in fact multiple interacting impacts from the climate indices modulate severe integrated meteorological and agricultural droughts from computed msdi series over the 1979 2016 period it is distinguished that the severe historical droughts mostly correspond to strong la niña phases while the wet periods are likely associated with either very strong or strong el niño beyond enso the footprint of highly cold pdo and to lower magnitude positive nao are also seen in the severe droughts across the country overall the concurrent correlation results corroborate those results obtained from other analyses since first the oceanic atmospheric circulations of the pacific ocean have a larger correlation with iran s drought compared to the atlantic ocean second droughts are generally correlated positively with pacific ocean oscillations and negatively with atlantic ocean oscillations particularly ao and nao in the cwts the primary dominant periodicity of the droughts is occurred at 4 8 year bands for the northern parts cl1 to cl3 cl5 and cl10 to cl13 from west to east and at 10 year bands for the rest country from the wtc observations coherence between the pacific based indices and iran s drought is relatively stronger and more extensive compared to the atlantic based indices it is observed that amo shows a low coherence with droughts over iran at wtcs although in the concurrent correlation map it is moderately correlated with droughts across northern iran the coherence patterns between both ao and nao and droughts are relatively similar and stronger than those for amo nonetheless all the atlantic based indices show mostly anti correlation with iran s drought overall the atlantic ocean impacts tend to be higher at the upper latitudes of the northwestern and northeastern parts of iran the three indices of enso pdo and pna that originated from the pacific ocean on the whole are positively correlated with droughts over iran droughts have the highest positive correlation with niño since in addition to its highest mean coherence with iran s drought 0 57 among the single indices its wtcs also show the widest coherence patterns compared to other indices the coherence patterns for both pdo and pna are roughly similar to those from niño i e enso but to a smaller magnitude and lesser extent furthermore according to the wtc results and the correlation coefficient maps a substantial enso and pdo imprint is not seen in droughts across the southeastern portions and the caspian sea coast due to the contribution of surface water bodies of the caspian sea and the indian ocean on local climate conditions finally the three coupled indices have been identified as more important than two coupled or single indices for modulating iran s drought the enhanced understanding of the multiple interacting ocean atmospheric phenomena influencing the occurrence of severe droughts found here would be immensely helpful for improving drought prediction adaptation planning and disaster preparedness therefore this study suggests that considering the integrated impacts from the ocean atmospheric rather than two coupled or single indices is crucial for better understanding their teleconnections with hydro climate events and better predicting

4174,glacier mass balance provides a sensitive barometer of climate glacier interactions yet only a few glaciers have been continuously well documented here we evaluated the retreat status of baishui river glacier no 1 reference glacier of yulong snow mountain during the 1951 2020 period and explored its response to climate change in particular based on 12 years of continuous in situ measurements we presented the first comprehensive set of mass balance for the baishui river glacier no 1 from 2008 to 2020 the result shows that the baishui river glacier no 1 suffered sustained shrinkage in terms of both its area which fell by 36 and reserves with cumulative mass losses over 32 38 3 62 m w e over the past 70 years the terminus rose from 4100 m asl in 1982 to 4395 m asl in 2017 the equilibrium line altitude has risen above the glacier s summit since 2010 and the accumulation zone disappeared since the 1980s the acceleration of glacier retreat has become established and has been further strengthened after 2000 this corresponds to the process of climate warming in situ measurements showed that any glacial accumulation during the non monsoon period with a multiyear mean of 0 53 0 08 m w e fell far short of offsetting the ablation driven by both air temperature and liquid precipitation in the monsoon season with a multiyear mean of 2 08 0 20 m w e meaning that the glacier could not attain a state of equilibrium and quickly lost a significant mass with multiyear mean losses of 1 54 0 30 m w e given that the current atmospheric conditions are unlikely to allow baishui river glacier no 1 to suppress its loss trend keywords temperate glacier mass balance glaciological method liquid precipitation 1 introduction mountain surface air temperatures are projected to continue increasing until the mid 21st century at a mean rate of 0 3 0 2 c 10a and locally even more in some regions generally outpacing the current global warming rate of 0 2 0 1 c 10a hock et al 2019 mountain glaciers worldwide have experienced continuous losses driven by multidecadal variations in global warming and atmospheric circulation patterns solomina et al 2016 satellite and in situ observations of changes in the glacier area length and mass have shown a globally coherent recession signal over the past few decades hugonnet et al 2021 zemp et al 2015 although there are significant differences in annual variability between regions medwedeff and roe 2017 nevertheless the temperate glaciers on the southeastern tibetan plateau including those found in the hengduan mountains the eastern himalayas and the central and eastern sectors of the nyaingentanglha mountains have experienced the most pronounced glacier mass loss over recent decades yao et al 2012 bolch et al 2019 shean

potential influences beniston et al 2018 huss et al 2021 notwithstanding recent advances in remote sensing technology that have allowed the use of geodetic and gravity methods with unprecedented efficiency to estimate the magnitude and regional variability of glacier changes e g brun et al 2017 wouters et al 2019 the geodetic dem differencing or satellite gravimetry suffer from the inadequacy of local resolutions in space and time and the consequent are often insufficiently dense to disentangle and capture fine scale glacier mass change signals brun et al 2017 hugonnet et al 2021 on the other hand the use of unmanned aerial vehicle uav data has huge potential advantages in mountain glacier monitoring immerzeel et al 2014 wigmore and mark 2017 although published survey data are currently limited some studies have used energy mass balance e g huintjes et al 2015 li et al 2018 zhu et al 2021 models to bridge the gap and produce annual temporal resolution data but these studies were limited to areas where meteorological data were available and parameters errors may affect the quality and reliability of the results cao et al 2019 the classic method of measuring mass balance is the direct or glaciological method which determines ablation and accumulation totals kaser et al 2003 the glaciological method can effectively capture fine scale glacier mass balance changes and allow the detection of these variations over a timescale of several days to weeks however the harsh field measurement conditions e g severe weather rugged topography and logistical difficulties have meant that only a few glaciers have been well documented using the traditional glaciological methodology and even fewer have been monitored over periods outpacing ten years diolaiuti et al 2011 vincent et al 2013 among the more than 200 000 glaciers around the globe only a few hundred have been monitored in situ wgms 2019 whilst only three glaciers abramov glacier in pamir alay urumqi glacier no 1 and tuyuksu glacier in tien shan with long term in situ mass balance measurements over 30 years in all of high mountain asia bolch et al 2019 compared with urumqi tuyuksu abramov the direct glaciological measurements of the temperate glaciers have started relatively late and have been discontinuous and incomplete only in the last 10 years several chinese low latitude temperate glaciers e g baishui river glacier no 1 in mt yulong parlung glacier no 94 and parlung glacier no 4 have been selected for continuous in situ measurement and several years of investigations data on parlung glacier no 94 have been published in wgms e g yang et al 2016 yao et al 2012 in this paper the yulong snow mountain 26 59 27 17 n 100 04 100 15 e fig 1 a in south eastern tibet plateau tp located in the southern end of the hengduan mountains was selected as the study area we perform the first comprehensive data sets of mass balance for the baishui river glacier no 1 reference glacier of yulong snow mountain based on 12 years of continuous in situ observations particular focus on making a preliminary explanation on the multi year and seasonal trends and affecting factors of the mass balance of brg1 the observation data presented in this study are rather novel because little has been published so far in the international literature on these temperate glaciers in the far southeast of high mountain asia another advantage is the highly resolved data on the mass balance of brg1 we provide will be beneficial to establish a baseline to compare the monitoring in the future or other regions 2 study site and meteorological information 2 1 yulong snow mountain the yulong snow mountain otherwise known as mt yulong massif 26 59 27 17 n 100 04 100 15 e is the southernmost glaciated region in eurasia extending 13 km from east to west and 35 km north to south the mt yulong glaciers have been classified as temperate glaciers shi et al 2008 dyurgerov et al 2009 most of these ice bodies exist at the pressure melting point and are much more sensitive to climatic warming than mid latitude and polar glaciers su and shi 2002 geologically active quaternary faults bound mt yulong causing the uplift of the mt yulong massif and subsidence of the lijiang basin with consequent deep incision by the jinsha river fig 1a kong et al 2009 moreover the roughness of the terrain in the vertical heights of the mt yulong massif is remarkable and the area s biodiversity and natural and cultural landscapes are rich and varied wang et al 2020 there are 13 glaciers on the mt yulong massif which are distributed on the massif s eastern slopes fig 1a 2 2 baishui river glacier no 1 the baishui river glacier no 1 brg1 fig 1b is the largest individual reference glacier in yulong snow mountain and its movement and mass loss data sets have been well recorded in the field in the past decade the records show that the mean surface velocity of the brg1 was 22 5 m yr 1 with a pronounced slowing trend rate of 1 73 m yr 1 yan et al 2021 on the brg1 the slope mirrored any declining trends from the glacier terminus to the up glacier with an average of 0 27 yan et al 2021 the crevasses are most densely developed near the terminus 0 36 m m2 and the farther away from the terminus toward the up glacier the lower the crevasse density yan et al 2021 in particular the ice thickness 1200 m from the terminus the average thickness of 52 5 m was measured using ground penetrating radar in 2018 liu et al 2020 2 3 meteorological information atmospheric circulation patterns in the mt yulong area are characterized by the indian monsoon in the monsoon season june september and the westerly system in the non monsoon season october may meanwhile the east asian monsoon can also arrive at this area and involve in regional atmospheric circulation pu et al 2020 shi et al 2020 generally the monthly temperature of the region around near brg1 fluctuated between 8 9 c january and 5 6 c june with an average of 0 11 c close to 0 c and there was a significant seasonal difference in temperatures fig 2 a c the mean temperature in the monsoon and non monsoon seasons was observed to be 4 43 c and 3 78 c respectively and the corresponding change rates were approximately 0 74 c 10a and 0 23 c 10a respectively table 1 the mean monthly precipitation reached its peak in july 510 mm and lowest in december 36 mm fig 2b 2d the mean annual precipitation in the glaciated area was 2398 mm during the 2008 2020 period with clearly defined wet and dry seasons table 1 the multiyear mean monsoon precipitation and non monsoon precipitation were found to be 1416 mm and 982 mm respectively rates corresponding to approximately 75 35 mm 10a and 15 38 mm 10a respectively table 1 3 data and methods 3 1 glacial morphologic parameters to help evaluate the changes in the areas of the glaciers on mt yulong massif we referred to the results of previous studies table 2 wang et al 2020 used manual methods to map the glacier s outlines from topographic maps and satellite images and calculate the glacier s areas we manually digitized the length of the brg1 at different times along the centerline from the up glacier to the terminus moreover we also counted the changes in the number of the glaciers extant in the mt yulong area the advance and retreat of the brg1 appear to be directly reflected by fluctuations in the altitude of its terminus the earliest recorded altitude of the brg1 s terminus was in 1982 but continuous observations were not restarted until 1999 since 1999 the altitude of the brg1 s terminus has been continuously observed and recorded by researchers as an essential component of the field monitoring project here we collated all known terminus observation datasets including the records for 1999 2006 pang et al 2010 and 2006 2017 periods table 2 3 2 glacier mass balance we estimate the mass balance by determining the net ablation and net accumulation separately as net ablation and accumulation essentially involve different processes the specific measuring methods and times had to be carefully chosen during the monsoon period june september we use the measuring stakes fig 1b on the glacier surface to observe the net ablation fig 3 a b the mass balance of a single point bn was obtained by xie et al 1999 1 b n 1 2 b f 1 2 b s p 1 2 b i 1 2 2 b f 1 2

sp and f represent ice spur ice and firn 1 2 denotes two adjacent observations hf 1 and hf 2 denote the thickness of firn at two adjacent observations times respectively hsp 1 and hsp 2 indicate the thickness of spur ice at two successive measurements respectively m 1 and m 2 are the height of the stake above the snow and ice surface i e the distance from the top of the stake to the snow and ice surface for the two adjacent observations respectively ρi ρsp and ρf denote the density of ice spur ice and firn the parameters ρi 0 9 g cm3 ρsp 0 85 g cm3 were referred based on literature values xie et al 1999 wang et al 2020 and the parameter ρf 0 45 g cm3 was measured by a study on the evolution of snow meltwater in brg1 by pu et al 2020b in the non monsoon period october may we determine the net accumulation based on the depth of the snow pit figs 1b 3c and the snow densities and thicknesses become the necessary measurement indicators the net accumulation can be calculated as follows 5 b n h f ρ f where hf and ρ f are the thickness and average density 0 45 g cm3 of the frin we then extrapolate these measurements to the entire glacier and the glacier wide mass balance bn was calculated as 6 b n 1 s i 1 n s i b i where bi is the mass balance of the given altitudinal zone i over map area si and s is the total glacial area the accuracy of the mass balance is subject to many measurement factors such as the observation network composed of measuring stakes and snow pits reading errors and different observers zemp et al 2013 therefore here we take the measurement error into account when calculating the mass balance the measurement error σ n can be calculated as follows 7 σ n 1 s i 1 n s i σ i where σ i is the standard deviation from the mean of mass balance i e the mean of multiple single point mass balance of the zone i of the given altitudinal zone i over map area si and s is the total area of glacier using the methods outlined above we installed a mass balance observation system on the glacier s surface with measuring stakes and snow pits figs 1b 3b c and evaluated the net mass balance the mass balance in the monsoon and non monsoon periods and the evolution of the mass balance along the gradient of the bgr1 from 2008 to 2020 here we also refer to the mass balance data reconstructed from 1952 to 2007 by wang et al 2020 and zhang 2015 using the degree day model table 2 fluctuations in glacier mass balance are usually reflected in the rise or fall of the equilibrium line altitude ela cuffey and paterson 2010 on the ela the annual accumulation is canceled out by the annual ablation wang et al 2010 which distinguishes the ablation range lower altitude than ela and accumulation range higher altitude than ela therefore the accumulation area ratio aar becomes a key parameter to evaluate the stability of glaciers we compiled the known observation records for the 2008 2020 period and referenced the dataset of the previous work zhang 2005 from 1957 to 2005 table 2 3 3 climate data analysis the meteorological data for the 1951 2020 period as used in this study were downloaded from the lijiang meteorological station cmdc http data cma cn this station located 25 kmsouth of mt yulong massif has captured the variations in climate experienced by this glacier region the magnitude trends and seasonality of the temperature and precipitation records formed the basis of our assessment multiyear mean annual precipitation map mean annual temperature mat and monsoon and non monsoon period temperature and precipitation datasets for the 1951 2020 period were collated the yulong snow mountain glacier and environment observation and research station 27 10 n 100 13 e 2400 m asl have been recording snow and meteorological observations for mt yulong massif since 2005 at the lateral moraine of the brg1 an automatic weather station 27 19 n 100 10 e 4700 m asl fig 1b provided climatic data i e mean monthly temperature and mean monthly precipitation values for the 2008 2020 period to reveal the relationships between mass balance and meteorological conditions in this glaciated area 4 results 4 1 long term status of glaciers on the mt yulong massif in order to comprehensively and visually assess the status of glaciers on mt yulong massif we began by describing this in terms of the variations in glacial coverage glacier area for individual glaciers and number of glaciers fig 4 a shows the extreme glacial shrinkage indicative of a reduction in both glacial coverage and number of glaciers whereby glacial coverage fell by 64 and nine glaciers were lost during the 1957 2017 period the total glacial area fell at a rate of 1 1 over the 60 year study period from 12 45 km2 in 1957 to 4 48 km2 in 2017 in particular since the 1980s there have been more dramatic changes than had been previously observed wherein glacial coverage had shrunk to about one third of its previous size and only 13 glaciers remained by 2017 fig 4a we compiled detailed mass balance information and summarized the area length front position and ela of the brg1 from 1951 to 2020 fig 4b fig 5 an intense retreating trend is discernible in our observations of the brg1 the glacier s area decreased by 0 75 km2 from 2 07 km2 in 1957 to 1 32 km2 in 2017 a fall of 36 fig 4b the shrinkage changed from 0 21 km2 between 1957 and 1982 to 0 54 km2 between 1982 and 2017 similar to the variations observed in the glacier s area measurements of the glacier s length also indicateda rapid retreat of the glacier between 1957 and 2017 fig 4b shows how glacier length generally exhibited a decreasing trend i e decreased by a total of 750 m from 1957 to 2017 at a reduction rate of 12 5 m yr 1 and that this tendency became more significant from 1980 onwards the reduction outlined above was largely attributable to the retreat of the glacier s terminus fig 5 a when comparing the first measurement in 1982 with the gps observation data in 2017 the altitude of the terminus rose from 4100 m to 4395 m asl with the terminus retreating by 295 m at a mean rate of 8 4 m yr 1 analyzing our observations for the period since 1982 it is apparent that the terminus retreated significantly by 14 m yr 1 between 1999 and 2017 accounting for 60 70 of the total shrinkage between 1982 and 2017 we presumed the potential location close to 4 000 m asl in the 1950 s of the glacier s terminus from 1950 to 1982 using the variations in glacier length fig 5b shows the range of observed elas for the brg1 and indicates that the mean ela rose by 300 m during the 1952 2017 period during the study period before 1980 the mean ela was 4800 m asl and the aar was 0 36 he et al 2010 comparing the brg1 with the aar of 0 67 for valley glaciers in a stable state as determined by previous researchers dyurgerov et al 2009 it is clear that the glacier we studied lost its stability before the 1980 s however its unstable state has evolved even more dramatically since 2000 with its ela rising at a rate of 158 1 m 10a between 2000 and 2010 since 2010 the ela has risen above the brg1 s summit 5050 m asl disappearing along with the accumulation altitudinal range here we analyze the main trends in the glacier cumulative mass balance fig 5c the brg1 experienced significant mass loss 13 81 m w e over the 1951 2007 period the 1950 1980 period experienced a slight increase in the cumulative mass balance and in general ablation and accumulation amounts were sufficient to offset each other with a cumulative mass balance of 0 68 m w e within the 1980 2007 period interannual variations have clearly reflected recent climatic forcing with the brg1 experiencing conspicuous mass losses i e a cumulative mass loss of 14 49 m w e the brg1 turn into continuous mass losses year after year moreover this accelerating loss has been reinforced since the 2000 s with deficit rates of almost 1 m w e yr 1 to explore this intense loss of the brg1 s ice during the study period 1951 2007 our study focused on the variability of the mass balance in and between each year fig 5d we calculated an average mass balance of 0 25 m w e yr 1 at bgr1 between 1951 and 2007 the annual average mass balance was 0 02 m w e and 0 54 m w e during the 1951 1980 and 1980 2007 periods respectively the mass balance data shows negative values during 15 out of the 30 years prior to 1980 are even more negative during 1980 2007 with only six positive years 4 2 recent observed mass balance to resolve fully the recent behavior of brg1 we built maps of the annual mass balance and interannual mass balance differences based on in situ measurements for the 2008 2020 period 400 1400 m longitudinal profile fig 1b 6 the multi year average of brg1 s mass balance gradient along with altitude is 0 76 m w e 100 m 1 during the 2008 2020 period the high mass loss occurred in the near terminus region 400 650 m from the terminus with an altitude of 4600 4670 m asl of the brg1 and with a mean mass balance of 3 56 2 88 m w e yr 1 the glacier s mass balance 650 1100 m from the terminus altitude 4670 4780 m asl gradually increased from 2 88 to 0 13 m w e yr 1 in the profile of the bgr1 1100 m from the terminus altitude 4780 4850 m asl the annual mass balance of the glacier varied within the 1 02 0 41 m w e yr 1 range fig 6 a d furthermore the maximum mass loss of the glacier appeared at the section 400 m from the terminus at an altitude of 4600 m asl and with a mean mass balance of 3 6 m w e yr 1 its position of minimum mass loss was reached 1400 m above the terminus at an altitude of 4850 m asl and with a mean mass balance of 0 4 m w e yr 1 in particular we noted that a relatively large mass loss 1 14 m w e yr 1 1200 m at an altitude of 4800 m asl different from other values observed in the up glacier section mean mass balance of 0 74 m w e yr 1 with this trend occurring every year between 2008 and 2020 fig 6a d we attributed this observed volatility to an arc shaped crevasses group in this section of the brg1 fig 1b the multi years anomalies show that the interannual variation of the mass balance from terminus to upstream glacier fluctuated within the range of 0 0 4 m w e roughly fig 6b d we note that the mass balance along the gradient in 2011 2012 was greater than observed in other years resulting in strong abnormal signals in 2009 2011 and 2010 2012 the negative anomalies 0 4 to 1 m w e observed in 2010 2012 have extended to the section 600 1200 m from the terminus and a positive anomaly 0 2 0 8 m w e in the 400 1200 m range in 2009 2011 fig 6c shows mass balance profiles averaged from non monsoon and monsoon pairs for the period from 2008 to 2020 however a state of outspending accumulation far less than ablation was observed at all gradients in the study region the mean mass balance profile patterns for the monsoon season on the brg1 indicate that the most mass loss occurred in the lowermost terminus region and decreased towards up glacier with a significant variability mass balance gradient 1 04 m w e 100 m 1 fig 6c there appears to be a less pronounced variability in mean mass balance profile patterns for the non monsoon season mass balance gradient 0 13 m w e 100 m 1 fig 6c 4 3 the characteristic of observed mass balance using measuring stakes and snow pit measurements we obtained estimates of the mass balance budget experienced by the brg1 per year for the 2008 2020 period the glacier gets the maximum mass supplies in the late spring april may and melts most strongly in the mid summer july august fig 7 two variables namely ablation amount and accumulation amount were introduced to explain the heterogeneity in observed mass losses fig 8 we found that the accumulation with a multiyear mean of 0 53 0 08 m w e far from offset increased ablation with a multiyear mean of 2 08 0 20 m w e to leave the glacier to be in a state of equilibrium resulting in a rapid and significant loss of mass i e a multiyear mean mass loss of 1 54 0 30 m w e of the brg1 s ice during the 2008 2020 period fig 8 by adding up the mass losses for each year from 2008 to 2020 we calculated a total cumulative change of 18 57 3 62 m w e during the 2008 2020 period the year 2012 2013 beings the highest mass losses year 1 86 0 28 m w e yr 1 on average while 2010 2011 having the lowest mass losses 0 85 0 26 m w e yr 1 on average from 2008 to 2020 cumulative ablation and accumulation were found to be 25 03 2 44 and 6 45 1 01 m w e respectively the interannual variation in ablation was comparatively higher than that for accumulation with maximum and minimum ablation mass balances of 2 33 0 12 m w e 2012 2013 and 1 64 0 11 m w e 2010 2011 respectively and maximum and minimum accumulation mass balances of 0 73 0 09 m w e 2010 2011 and 0 4 0 10 m w e 2015 2016 respectively interestingly there seems to be a relationship between the amount of accumulation and the amount of ablation which is that higher accumulation inhibits ablation e g 2012 2013 whilst in years with little accumulation ablation shows a higher profile e g 2010 2011 5 analysis and discussion 5 1 seasonal and interannual variations in mass balance for brg1 the imbalance between insufficient accumulation and enhanced melting at a seasonal scale provides a perspective for understanding glacial mass losses over longer timescales braithwaite 2002 prinz et al 2016 during the monsoon season june september when the mean air temperature was 4 4 c precipitation was 1416 mm figs 2 9 the glaciers exhibit severe mass loss with a multiyear mean of 2 08 m w e fig 8 meanwhile we found that there was a clear correlation between the ablation and the mean monsoon temperature r 0 87 with the increase in air temperature ablation showed an increasing trend and the sensitivity of ablation to air temperature fluctuation was 0 46 m w e c 1 fig 9a stronger heat forcing higher air temperature and a strong rise in energy flux is considered to be more capable of continuing to warm the ice and produce higher amounts of meltwater e g vincent et al 2017 thibert et al 2018 although less attention has been paid to the impact of liquid precipitation on snow ice melting a clear correlation also exists between liquid precipitation and ablation r 0 73 that is the greater the liquid precipitation the greater the melting of the glacier surface on the brg1 fig 9b the sensitivity of ablation to liquid precipitation fluctuation was 0 22 m w e 100 mm 1 based on field observations we found several possible mechanisms that might account for this correlation the rainfall itself carries heat energy and may erode the ice body when they converge into rivers on the glacier importantly as a possible carrier they may bring the heat into the deeper zone of the glacier through the crevasse resulting in the melting of the englacial subglacial colgan et al 2016 hubbard et al 2021 in addition the water from rainfall and meltwater in surface crevasses apply hydraulic pressure on the crevasse walls and promote crevasse growth deeper into the glacier i e hydrofracture function which makes the heat forcing more powerful e g tuckett et al 2019 we therefore conclude that in addition to air temperature liquid precipitation is also an important factor driving the mass balance change of brg1 during the monsoon period a study of himalayan glacier changes also reported that liquid precipitation plays an important role in glacier melting during the ablation season fugger et al 2021 during the non monsoon season october may the mean air temperature was 3 8 c precipitation was 982 mm figs 2 9 the multi year average of accumulation on the bgr was 0 53 m w e fig 8 during this period the low temperature environment stopped the loss of glacier mass and accumulation occurred we found a weak negative correlation between the accumulation and temperature in the non monsoon period in the non monsoon period r 0 24 fig 9c the brg1 mainly gains mass accumulation in the form of solid precipitation snowfall which means that the greater the precipitation in the non monsoon period the greater the accumulation on the surface of the glacier and there should be a strong positive correlation between them although there is a positive correlation between the accumulated amount we observe and the non monsoon season precipitation the correlation is weak r 0 47 fig 9d a possible explanation is that the short term unobserved melting during the non monsoon season braithwaite 2002 was responsible for this weak correlation interestingly we note that changes in air temperature from late april to may pre monsoon play a key point in short unobserved periods of melting in the year of 2011 2012 although the amount of snowfall 1016 mm was not low fig 9d the temperature from late april to may 5 7 c was relatively higher than other years fig 2a the ablation season arrives early resulting in lower accumulation 0 42 m w e fig 8 based on the above analysis we found that when wang et al 2020 and zhang 2005 used the degree day model to simulate the mass balance of the brg1 from 1951 to 2007 only temperature driven ablation was considered i e the calculation of ice melting only relying on temperature as a parameter fig 5d in fact liquid precipitation is also driving the melting of ice and the short term unobserved melting will also occur during the non monsoon period therefore we speculate that the simulated mass value from 1951 to 2007 should be less than the actual mass loss value fig 5c in this case the accumulative mass loss of the brg1 from 1951 to 2007 exceeds 13 81 m w e combined with the actual measured accumulative mass loss 18 57 3 62 m w e fig 8 from 2008 to 2020 we infer that the accumulative mass loss of the brg1 has exceeded 32 38 3 62 m w e during the 1951 2020 period 5 2 general climatic warming on the mt yulong massif from 1951 to 2020 elevation dependent warming edw a specific concept that has been widely investigated in recent years means that the warming rate is more pronounced at high elevation pepin et al 2015 at both a local and regional scale on the tp there is evidence for elevation dependent warming i e a warming trend at higher altitudes has been found to be more pronounced over the tp gao et al 2018 yao et al 2012 with the warming rate increasing with altitude before becoming quite stable the declining slightly near the highest altitudes qin et al 2009 the rate of warming appears amplified around 4800 m asl but not above 6200 m asl an altitudinal band that encompasses the ablation elevation line of almost all glaciers on the tp gao et al 2018 qin et al 2009 warming on the tp has been found to be more pronounced in winter you et al 2010 which to some extent affects the amount and duration of glacier accumulation on the tp future projections of annual precipitation indicate that the indian monsoon is weakening swapna et al 2017 which in turn will influence changes in precipitation patterns yao et al 2012 the mt yulong massif is located on the southeastern edge of the tp and has experienced all the abovementioned aspects of climate change though to a certain extent the change seems to be more dramatic a comparative climatological analysis of mat and map values annual monsoon period mean temperature and precipitation and annual non monsoon period mean temperature and precipitation values from 1951 to 2020 on mt yulong massif is therefore given in fig 10 for the 1951 2020 period the mean temperatures were found to be 17 52 c 10 58 c and 12 91 c for the monsoon non monsoon and annual timeframes respectively fig 10 since the 1980 s a warming process has become established and has been further strengthened after 2000 fig 10 this corresponds to the acceleration in glacial retreat in the region figs 4 5 8 to ascertain the prevalence of such a warming process three periods were analyzed i e the years pre 1980 1980 2000 and post 2000 fig 10 fig 10 indicates that the mean temperatures pre 1980 for the monsoon non monsoon and annual timeframes were 17 18 c 10 26 c and 12 55 c respectively with corresponding warming rates of approximately 0 05 c 10a 0 032 c 10a and 0 037 c 10a respectively the increase in temperatures was relatively slow during 1980 2000 the mean temperatures of the monsoon non monsoon and annual stage were 17 49 c 10 38 c and 12 76 c respectively and the corresponding warming rates were approximately 0 16 c 10a 0 31 c 10a and 0 15 c 10a respectively fig 10a 10c 10e compared with the period pre 1980 the mean temperature rises rose by 0 31 c and 0 24 c in monsoon and annual period and rates 3 times and 4 times in monsoon and annual period of increase remained at a high level the mean temperatures post 2000 over the monsoon non monsoon and annual periods were 18 05 c 11 28 c and 13 57 c respectively and the corresponding warming rates were approximately 0 69 c 10a 0 32 c 10a and 0 48 c 10a respectively fig 10a c e in general the analysis of the data for 1951 2020 showed a rise in temperature during the monsoon and non monsoon seasons as well as on an annual basis the mean annual temperature changes over pre 1980 12 52 c 1980 2000 12 76 c and post 2000 13 57 c shows a stepwise increase with the warming rate after 2000 being dozens of times greater than that before 1980 compared with that before 1980 the mean monsoon temperature increases after 2000 was close 1 c 0 87 c and the mean non monsoon temperature increases after 2000 were 1 02 c temperatures particularly increased during the non monsoon season from 1951 to 2020 the annual climatological precipitation mean was recorded at 953 mm the mean precipitation values during the monsoon and non monsoon seasons were observed to be 775 mm and 182 mm respectively 81 7 of the total precipitation occurred during the monsoon period whereas 19 8 occurred during non monsoon months similarly we examined the changes in precipitation pre 1980 1980 2000 and post 2000 fig 10 indicates that the mean precipitation values pre 1980 over the monsoon non monsoon and annual periods were 770 mm 177 mm and 949 mm respectively the corresponding rates have no obvious trend of increase or decrease from 1980 to 2000 the mean precipitation values over the monsoon non monsoon and annual periods were 793 mm 186 mm and 981 mm respectively rates corresponding to approximately 120 58 mm 10a 12 34 mm 10a and 135 83 mm 10a respectively fig 10b d f precipitation showed an increasing trend during monsoon months and no clear increasing trend in non monsoon months for this period 1980 2000 mean precipitation values post 2000 over the monsoon non monsoon and annual timeframes were 758 mm 183 mm and 937 mm respectively corresponding to rates of approximately 51 75 mm 10a 24 63 mm 10a and 59 30 mm 10a respectively fig 10b d f here we noted that precipitation values over the monsoon non monsoon and annual periods appear to show a downward trend during the 2000 2020 period overall so far after a significant increase in precipitation between 1980 and 2000 the mean precipitation after 2000 has fallen back and is slightly lower than the level before 1980 fig 10 a numerical modeling study by zhu et al 2021 on naimona nyi glacier 30 27 n 81 92 e 6 050 m a s l has quantitatively shown that the current air temperature would need to be reduced by 1 1 c or precipitation increased by 49 to contain mass loss i e zero mass balance the brg1 as a temperature glacier would require a much larger decrease in temperature or increase in precipitation to reach zero mass balance than the mogannan glacier a typical sub continental glacier however the rises in temperature in the mt yulong area have become an indisputable fact and the precipitation has shown a decreasing trend in the last 20 years hence our analysis suggested that external temperature is the main driving force on glacier mass loss over interannual timescales on the basis of little change in precipitation the accelerated pace of glacier decline in the mt yulong massif over seven decades may therefore be better understood when applying this hydrothermal combination anomaly 5 3 glacial changes in typical temperate monsoon glacial regions rapid retreat and mass loss rates have characterized this and other temperate monsoon glaciers on the southeastern tp and in the hengduan mountains over the last few decades bolch et al 2019 these glaciers have all experienced negative mass balance conditions over several decades thereby greatly depleting their reserves in the central nyainqentanglha mountains 30

disappeared during the 1968 2016 period wu et al 2018a mass losses in 2000 2016 0 60 0 20 m w e yr 1 fig 11 a showed an accelerated trend compared with that the period of 1968 2000 0 42 0 05 m w e yr

coverage reduction rate of 0 71 0 06 yr 1 i e ice cover diminished by 24 9 from 1980 to 2015 wu et al 2018a there was a mean mass loss of 0 26 0 16 m w e yr 1 and 0 71 0 10 m w e yr 1 for the 1980 2000 and 2000 2014 periods respectively wu et al 2018b another comparative study from the gongga mountains 29 00 30 00 n 101 50 102 00 e calculated mass loss to be 0 42 0 07 m w e yr 1 fig 11a with a glacial coverage reduction rate of 0 67 yr 1 i e ice cover diminished by 11 3 over the 1966 2009 period zhang et al 2012 during the 2001 2009 period the mean mass balance of the hailuogou glacier studied in the gongga mountains was 0 79 m w e yr 1 2 3 times greater than that of the 1959 2000 period zhang et al 2012 compared with these temperate monsoon glacial areas we observed an even more dramatic mass loss for the glaciers on the mt yulong massif especially in the last 10 years figs 4 5 from 1951 to 2020 glacial coverage fell by 64 and on the brg1 the mean annual mass balance was 0 02 m w e yr 1 before 1980 changing to 0 54 m w e yr 1 during the 1980 2007 period fig 5d and then 1 54 m w e yr 1 between 2008 and 2020 fig 8 all these studies would suggest that such glaciers are far from being in a state of equilibrium and quickly lose a large amount of mass indeed the srocc reported that the relatively little ice cover smaller glaciers is more susceptible to rapid loss of mass compared with large scale temperature monsoon glacial regions e g the 1713 42 51 82 km2 glaciated area of the central nyainqentanglha range in 2016 wu et al 2018b the 2048 50 48 65 km2 glaciated area of the kangri karpo mountains in 2015 wu et al 2018a and the 22 85 km2 glaciated area on mt gongga in 2010 zhang et al 2015 the mt yulong massif has been less able to cope with climate change stress due to its small reserves area only 4 48 km2 in 2017 and low latitude in addition nineglaciers with an area of 1 km2 have disappeared over the past several decades fig 4a our observations would suggest that this pattern of disappearance will also affect the massif s 13 currently existing glaciers over the next few decades glacial retreat on both the global and local scale has never simply been attributed to natural phenomena as climate warming and extremely high temperature events continue and intensify the human fingerprints on extreme large scale glacier losses will become increasingly apparent in the coming decades vargo et al 2020 there is limited evidence that the increase in greenhouse gases caused by anthropogenic forcings has led to the observed changes in ice mass hirabayashi et al 2016 roe et al 2021 as the largest ski resort in china the mt yulong massif area is no exception according to statistics the number of tourists visiting yulong snow mountain was 0 1 million in 1995 and increased to 3 84 million in 2016 wang et al 2020 according to the lijiang national economic and social development statistical bulletin http www lijiang gov cn the number of tourists visiting lijiang city increased from 3 22 million in 2001 to 54 02 million in 2019 fig 11b since 2010 an intense increasing trend is discernible in the number of tourists visiting lijiang city fig 11b the thermal effect of the expansion of lijiang city fig 1a the urban area is only 25 km away from the glaciated area as well as the influx of millions of tourists brought about by the expansion of the tourist industry has undoubtedly had an inestimable impact upon levels of glacial melt in this region 6 conclusion compared with other temperate glacial areas the mt yulong massif due to its small reserves area and low latitude are less able to cope with climate forcing the glaciated area of mt yulong massif has experienced continuous shrinkage in terms of both glacial coverage and number of glaciers glacial coverage fell by 64 from 12 45 km2 in 1957 to 4 48 km2 in 2017 and nine glaciers from a total of 22 glaciers in 1957 to 13 glaciers in 2017 were lost during the 1957 2017 period for the brg1 referenced glacier its glacial coverage has decreased by 0 75 km2 a fall of 36 from 2 07 km2 in 1957 to 1 32 km2 in 2017 the glacier s length has also exhibited a generally decreasing trend i e decreasing by 750 m from 1957 to 2017 with a rate of retreat of 12 5 m yr 1 the glacier s terminus rose from 4100 m asl in 1982 to 4395 m asl in 2017 has retreated by 295 m at a mean rate of 8 4 m yr 1 and since 2010 the ela has risen above the glacier s summit at an altitude of 5050 m asl disappearing along with the accumulation zone we would attribute the observed significant glacier retreat and deficit to the undisputed regional climatic warming through in situ measurements over the 2008 2020 periods we found that accumulation of snow with a multiyear mean of 0 53 0 08 m w e during the non monsoon season was far from able to offset any increases in ablation during the monsoon season with a multiyear mean of 2 08 0 20 m w e the glacier was not therefore in equilibrium and rapidly lost mass with multiyear mean mass losses of 1 54 0 30 m w e cumulative mass losses of 18 57 3 62 m w e given that the ablation driven by both air temperature and liquid precipitation in the monsoon season has a significant impact on mass losses the imbalance between insufficient accumulation and enhanced melting at a seasonal scale provides an explanation for understanding mass losses over longer timescales combining the simulated value from 1951 to 2007 with accumulative mass loss 13 81 m w e the simulated value may be smaller than the actual value because the influence of liquid precipitation on ablation is not taken into account and the in situ measurements during 2008 2020 period with cumulative mass losses of 18 57 3 62 m w e we infer that the cumulative mass losses of brg1 has exceeded 32 38 3 62 m w e over the 1951 2020 period in 1980 there was a rapid change the aforementioned retreat was further strengthened and the loss of mass became more intense post 2000 the mean annual mass balance was 0 02 m w e yr 1 before 1980 changing to 0 54 m w e yr 1 during the 1980 2007 period and then 1 54 m w e yr 1 between 2008 and 2020 recorded climate data indicate that it is unlikely that the current atmospheric conditions will allow brg1 to reverse its loss trend and reach zero mass balance declaration of competing interest the

4174,glacier mass balance provides a sensitive barometer of climate glacier interactions yet only a few glaciers have been continuously well documented here we evaluated the retreat status of baishui river glacier no 1 reference glacier of yulong snow mountain during the 1951 2020 period and explored its response to climate change in particular based on 12 years of continuous in situ measurements we presented the first comprehensive set of mass balance for the baishui river glacier no 1 from 2008 to 2020 the result shows that the baishui river glacier no 1 suffered sustained shrinkage in terms of both its area which fell by 36 and reserves with cumulative mass losses over 32 38 3 62 m w e over the past 70 years the terminus rose from 4100 m asl in 1982 to 4395 m asl in 2017 the equilibrium line altitude has risen above the glacier s summit since 2010 and the accumulation zone disappeared since the 1980s the acceleration of glacier retreat has become established and has been further strengthened after 2000 this corresponds to the process of climate warming in situ measurements showed that any glacial accumulation during the non monsoon period with a multiyear mean of 0 53 0 08 m w e fell far short of offsetting the ablation driven by both air temperature and liquid precipitation in the monsoon season with a multiyear mean of 2 08 0 20 m w e meaning that the glacier could not attain a state of equilibrium and quickly lost a significant mass with multiyear mean losses of 1 54 0 30 m w e given that the current atmospheric conditions are unlikely to allow baishui river glacier no 1 to suppress its loss trend keywords temperate glacier mass balance glaciological method liquid precipitation 1 introduction mountain surface air temperatures are projected to continue

differences in annual variability between regions medwedeff and roe 2017 nevertheless the temperate glaciers on the southeastern tibetan plateau including those found in the hengduan mountains the eastern himalayas and the central and eastern sectors of the nyaingentanglha mountains have experienced the most pronounced glacier mass loss over recent decades yao et al 2012 bolch et al 2019 shean

currently limited some studies have used energy mass balance e g huintjes et al 2015 li et al 2018 zhu et al 2021 models to bridge the gap and produce annual temporal resolution data but these studies were limited to areas where meteorological data were available and parameters errors may affect the quality and reliability of the results cao et al 2019 the classic method of measuring mass balance is the direct or glaciological method which determines ablation and accumulation totals kaser et al 2003 the glaciological method can effectively capture fine scale glacier mass balance changes and allow the detection of these variations over a timescale of several days to weeks however the harsh field measurement conditions e g severe weather rugged topography and logistical difficulties have meant that only a few glaciers have been well documented using the traditional glaciological methodology and even fewer have been monitored over periods outpacing ten years diolaiuti et al 2011

located in the southern end of the hengduan mountains was selected as the study area we perform the first comprehensive data sets of mass balance for the baishui river glacier no 1 reference glacier of yulong snow mountain based on 12 years of continuous in situ observations particular focus on making a preliminary explanation on the multi year and seasonal trends and affecting factors of the mass balance of brg1 the observation data presented in this study are rather novel because little has been published so far in the international literature on these temperate glaciers in the far southeast of high mountain asia another advantage is the highly resolved data on the mass balance of brg1 we provide will be beneficial to establish a baseline to compare the monitoring in the future or other regions 2 study site and meteorological information 2 1 yulong snow mountain the yulong snow mountain otherwise known as mt yulong massif 26 59 27 17 n 100 04 100 15 e is the southernmost glaciated region in eurasia extending 13 km from east to west and 35 km north to south the mt yulong glaciers have been classified as temperate glaciers shi et al 2008 dyurgerov et al 2009 most of these ice bodies exist at the pressure melting point and are much more sensitive to climatic warming than mid latitude and polar glaciers su and shi 2002 geologically active quaternary faults bound mt yulong causing the uplift of the mt yulong massif and subsidence of the lijiang basin with consequent deep incision by the jinsha river fig 1a kong et al 2009 moreover the roughness of the terrain in the vertical heights of the mt yulong massif is remarkable and the area s biodiversity and natural and cultural landscapes are rich and varied wang et al 2020 there are 13 glaciers on the mt yulong massif which are distributed on the massif s eastern slopes fig 1a 2 2 baishui river glacier no 1 the baishui river glacier no 1 brg1 fig 1b is the largest individual reference glacier in yulong snow mountain and its movement and mass loss data sets have been well recorded in the field in the past decade the records show that the mean surface velocity of the brg1 was 22 5 m yr 1 with a pronounced slowing trend rate of 1 73 m yr 1 yan et al 2021 on the brg1 the slope mirrored any declining trends from the glacier terminus to the up glacier with an average of 0 27 yan et al 2021 the crevasses are most densely developed near the terminus 0 36 m m2 and the farther away from the terminus toward the up glacier the lower the crevasse density yan et al 2021 in particular the ice thickness 1200 m from the terminus the average thickness of 52 5 m was measured using ground penetrating radar in 2018 liu et al 2020 2 3 meteorological information atmospheric circulation patterns in the mt yulong area are characterized by the indian monsoon in the monsoon season june september and the westerly system in the non monsoon season october may meanwhile the east asian monsoon can also arrive at this area and involve in regional atmospheric circulation pu et al 2020 shi et al 2020 generally the monthly temperature of the region around near brg1 fluctuated between 8 9 c january and 5 6 c june with an average of 0 11 c close to 0 c and there was a significant seasonal difference in temperatures fig 2 a c the mean temperature in the monsoon and non monsoon seasons was observed to be 4 43 c and 3 78 c respectively and the corresponding change rates were approximately 0 74 c 10a and 0 23 c 10a respectively table 1 the mean monthly precipitation reached its peak in july 510 mm and lowest in december 36 mm fig 2b 2d the mean annual precipitation in the glaciated area was 2398 mm during the 2008 2020 period with clearly defined wet and dry seasons table 1 the multiyear mean monsoon precipitation and non monsoon precipitation were found to be 1416 mm and 982 mm respectively rates corresponding to approximately 75 35 mm 10a and 15 38 mm 10a respectively table 1 3 data and methods 3 1 glacial morphologic parameters to help evaluate the changes in the areas of the glaciers on mt yulong massif we referred to the results of previous studies table 2 wang et al 2020 used manual methods to map the glacier s outlines from topographic maps and satellite images and calculate the glacier s areas we manually digitized the length of the brg1 at different times along the centerline from the up glacier to the terminus moreover we also counted the changes in the number of the glaciers extant in the mt yulong area the advance and retreat of the brg1 appear to be directly reflected by fluctuations in the altitude of its terminus the earliest recorded altitude of the brg1 s terminus was in 1982 but continuous observations were not restarted until 1999 since 1999 the altitude of the brg1 s terminus has been continuously observed and recorded by researchers as an essential component of the field monitoring project here we collated all known terminus observation datasets including the records for 1999 2006 pang et al 2010 and 2006 2017 periods table 2 3 2 glacier mass balance we estimate the mass balance by determining the net ablation and net accumulation separately as net ablation and accumulation essentially involve different processes the specific measuring methods and times had to be carefully chosen during the monsoon period june september we use the measuring stakes fig 1b on the glacier surface to observe the net ablation fig 3 a b the mass balance of a single point bn was obtained by xie et al 1999 1 b n 1 2 b f 1 2 b s p 1 2 b i 1 2 2 b f 1 2

sp and f represent ice spur ice and firn 1 2 denotes two adjacent observations hf 1 and hf 2 denote the thickness of firn at two adjacent observations times respectively hsp 1 and hsp 2 indicate the thickness of spur ice at two successive measurements respectively m 1 and m 2 are the height of the stake above the snow and ice surface i e the distance from the top of the stake to the snow and ice surface for the two adjacent observations respectively ρi ρsp and ρf denote the density of ice spur ice and firn the parameters ρi 0 9 g cm3 ρsp 0 85 g cm3 were referred based on literature values xie et al 1999 wang et al 2020 and the parameter ρf 0 45 g cm3 was measured by a study on the evolution of snow meltwater in brg1 by pu et al 2020b in the non monsoon period october may we determine the net accumulation based on the depth of the snow pit figs 1b 3c and the snow densities and thicknesses become the necessary measurement indicators the net accumulation can be calculated as follows 5 b n h f ρ f where hf and ρ f are the thickness and average density 0 45 g cm3 of the frin we then extrapolate these measurements to the entire glacier and the glacier wide mass balance bn was calculated as 6 b n 1 s i 1 n s i b i where bi is the mass balance of the given altitudinal zone i over map area si and s is the total glacial area the accuracy of the mass balance is subject to many measurement factors such as the observation network composed of measuring stakes and snow pits reading errors and different observers zemp et al 2013 therefore here we take the measurement error into account when calculating the mass balance the measurement error σ n can be calculated as follows 7 σ n 1 s i 1 n s i σ i where σ i is the standard deviation from the mean of mass balance i e the mean of multiple single point mass balance of the zone i of the given altitudinal zone i over map area si and s is the total area of glacier using the methods outlined above we installed a mass balance observation system on the glacier s surface with measuring stakes and snow pits figs 1b 3b c and evaluated the net mass balance the mass balance in the monsoon and non monsoon periods and the evolution of the mass balance along the gradient of the bgr1 from 2008 to 2020 here we also refer to the mass balance data reconstructed from 1952 to 2007 by wang et al 2020 and zhang 2015 using the degree day model table 2 fluctuations in glacier mass balance are usually reflected in the rise or fall of the equilibrium line altitude ela cuffey and paterson 2010 on the ela the annual accumulation is canceled out by the annual ablation wang et al 2010 which distinguishes the ablation range lower altitude than ela and accumulation range higher altitude than ela therefore the accumulation area ratio aar becomes a key parameter to evaluate the stability of glaciers we compiled the known observation records for the 2008 2020 period and referenced the dataset of the previous work zhang 2005 from 1957 to 2005 table 2 3 3 climate data analysis the meteorological data for the 1951 2020 period as used in this study were downloaded from the lijiang meteorological station cmdc http data cma cn this station

formed the basis of our assessment multiyear mean annual precipitation map mean annual temperature mat and monsoon and non monsoon period temperature and precipitation datasets for the 1951 2020 period were collated the yulong snow mountain glacier and environment observation and research station 27 10 n 100 13 e 2400 m asl have been recording snow and meteorological observations for mt

precipitation values for the 2008 2020 period to reveal the relationships between mass balance and meteorological conditions in this glaciated area 4 results 4 1 long term status of glaciers on the mt yulong massif in order to comprehensively and visually assess the status of glaciers on mt yulong massif we began by describing this in terms of the variations in glacial coverage glacier area for individual glaciers and number of glaciers fig 4 a shows the extreme glacial shrinkage indicative of a reduction in both glacial coverage and number of glaciers whereby glacial coverage fell by 64 and nine glaciers were lost during the 1957 2017 period the total glacial area fell at a rate of 1 1 over the 60 year study period from 12 45 km2 in 1957 to 4 48 km2 in 2017 in particular since the 1980s there have been more dramatic changes than had been previously observed wherein glacial coverage had shrunk to about one third of its previous size and only 13 glaciers remained by 2017 fig 4a we compiled detailed mass balance information and summarized the area length front position and ela of the brg1 from 1951 to 2020 fig 4b fig 5 an intense retreating trend is discernible in our observations of the brg1 the glacier s area decreased by 0 75 km2 from 2 07 km2 in 1957 to 1 32 km2 in 2017 a fall of 36 fig 4b the shrinkage changed from 0 21 km2 between 1957 and 1982 to 0 54 km2 between 1982 and 2017 similar to the variations observed in the glacier s area measurements of the glacier s length also indicateda rapid retreat of the glacier between 1957 and 2017 fig 4b shows how glacier length generally exhibited a decreasing trend i e decreased by a total of 750 m from 1957 to 2017 at a reduction rate of 12 5 m yr 1 and that this tendency became more significant from 1980 onwards the reduction outlined above was largely attributable to the retreat of the glacier s terminus fig 5 a when comparing the first measurement in 1982 with the gps observation data in 2017 the altitude of the terminus rose from 4100 m to 4395 m asl with the terminus retreating by 295 m at a mean rate of 8 4 m yr 1 analyzing our observations for the period since 1982 it is apparent that the terminus retreated significantly by 14 m yr 1 between 1999 and 2017 accounting for 60 70 of the total shrinkage between 1982 and 2017 we presumed the potential location close to 4 000 m asl in the 1950 s of the glacier s terminus from 1950 to 1982 using the variations in glacier length fig 5b shows the range of observed elas for the brg1 and indicates that the mean ela rose by 300 m during the 1952 2017 period during the study period before 1980 the mean ela was 4800 m asl and the aar was 0 36 he et al 2010 comparing the brg1 with the aar of 0 67 for valley glaciers in a stable state as determined by previous researchers dyurgerov et al 2009 it is clear that the glacier we studied lost its stability before the 1980 s however its unstable state has evolved even more dramatically since 2000 with its ela rising at a rate of 158 1 m 10a between 2000 and 2010 since 2010 the ela has risen above the brg1 s summit 5050 m asl disappearing along with the accumulation altitudinal range here we analyze the main trends in the glacier cumulative mass balance fig 5c the brg1 experienced significant mass loss 13 81 m w e over the 1951 2007 period the 1950 1980 period experienced a slight increase in the cumulative mass balance and in general ablation and accumulation amounts were sufficient to offset each other with a cumulative mass balance of 0 68 m w e within the 1980 2007 period interannual variations have clearly reflected recent climatic forcing with the brg1 experiencing conspicuous mass losses i e a cumulative mass loss of 14 49 m w e the brg1 turn into continuous mass losses year after year moreover this accelerating loss has been reinforced since the 2000 s with deficit rates of almost 1 m w e yr 1 to explore this intense loss of the brg1 s ice during the study period 1951 2007 our study focused on the variability of the mass balance in and between each year fig 5d we calculated an average mass balance of 0 25 m w e yr 1 at bgr1 between 1951 and 2007 the annual average mass balance was 0 02 m w e and 0 54 m w e during the 1951 1980 and 1980 2007 periods respectively the mass balance data shows negative values during 15 out of the 30 years prior to 1980 are even more negative during 1980 2007 with only six positive years 4 2 recent observed mass balance to resolve fully the recent behavior of brg1 we built maps of the annual mass balance and interannual mass balance differences based on in situ measurements for the 2008 2020 period 400 1400 m longitudinal profile fig 1b 6 the multi year average of brg1 s mass balance gradient along with altitude is 0 76 m w e 100 m 1 during the 2008 2020 period the high mass loss occurred in the near terminus region 400 650 m from the terminus with an altitude of 4600 4670 m asl of the brg1 and with a mean mass balance of 3 56 2 88 m w e yr 1 the glacier s mass balance 650 1100 m from the terminus altitude 4670 4780 m asl gradually increased from 2 88 to 0 13 m w e yr 1 in the profile of the bgr1 1100 m from the terminus altitude 4780 4850 m asl the annual mass balance of the glacier varied within the 1 02 0 41 m w e yr 1 range fig 6 a d furthermore the maximum mass loss of the glacier appeared at the section 400 m from the terminus at an altitude of 4600 m asl and with a mean mass balance of 3 6 m w e yr 1 its position of minimum mass loss was reached 1400 m above the terminus at an altitude of 4850 m asl and with a mean mass balance of 0 4 m w e yr 1 in particular we noted that a relatively large mass loss 1 14 m w e yr 1 1200 m at an altitude of 4800 m asl different from other values observed in the up glacier section mean mass balance of 0 74 m w e yr 1 with this trend occurring every year between 2008 and 2020 fig 6a d we attributed this observed volatility to an arc shaped crevasses group in this section of the brg1 fig 1b the multi years anomalies show that the interannual variation of the mass balance from terminus to upstream glacier fluctuated within the range of 0 0 4 m w e roughly fig 6b d we note that the mass balance along the gradient in 2011 2012 was greater than observed in other years resulting in strong abnormal signals in 2009 2011 and 2010 2012 the negative anomalies 0 4 to 1 m w e observed in 2010 2012 have extended to the section 600 1200 m from the terminus and a positive anomaly 0 2 0 8 m w e in the 400 1200 m range in 2009 2011 fig 6c shows mass balance profiles averaged from non monsoon and monsoon pairs for the period from 2008 to 2020 however a state of outspending accumulation far less than ablation was observed at all gradients in the study region the mean mass balance profile patterns for the monsoon season on the brg1 indicate that the most mass loss occurred in the lowermost terminus region and decreased towards up glacier with a significant variability mass balance gradient 1 04 m w e 100 m 1 fig 6c there appears to be a less pronounced variability in mean mass balance profile patterns for the non monsoon season mass balance gradient 0 13 m w e 100 m 1 fig 6c 4 3 the characteristic of observed mass balance using measuring stakes and snow pit measurements we obtained estimates of the mass balance budget experienced by the brg1 per year for the 2008 2020 period the glacier gets the maximum mass supplies in the late spring april may and melts most strongly in the mid summer july august fig 7 two variables namely ablation amount and accumulation amount were introduced to explain the heterogeneity in observed mass losses fig 8 we found that the accumulation with a multiyear mean of 0 53 0 08 m w e far from offset increased ablation with a multiyear mean of 2 08 0 20 m w e to leave the glacier to be in a state of equilibrium resulting in a rapid and significant loss of mass i e a multiyear mean mass loss of 1 54 0 30 m w e of the brg1 s ice during the 2008 2020 period fig 8 by adding up the mass losses for each year from 2008 to 2020 we calculated a total cumulative change of 18 57 3 62 m w e during the 2008 2020 period the year 2012 2013 beings the highest mass losses year 1 86 0 28 m w e yr 1 on average while 2010 2011 having the lowest mass losses 0 85 0 26 m w e yr 1 on average from 2008 to 2020 cumulative ablation and accumulation were found to be 25 03 2 44 and 6 45 1 01 m w e respectively the interannual variation in ablation was comparatively higher than that for accumulation with maximum and minimum ablation mass balances of 2 33 0 12 m w e 2012 2013 and 1 64 0 11 m w e 2010 2011 respectively and maximum and minimum accumulation mass balances of 0 73 0 09 m w e 2010 2011 and 0 4 0 10 m w e 2015 2016 respectively interestingly there seems to be a relationship between the amount of accumulation and the amount of ablation which is that higher accumulation inhibits ablation e g 2012 2013 whilst in years with little accumulation ablation shows a higher profile e g 2010 2011 5 analysis and discussion 5 1 seasonal and interannual variations in mass balance for brg1 the imbalance between insufficient accumulation and enhanced melting at a seasonal scale provides a perspective for understanding glacial mass losses over longer timescales braithwaite 2002 prinz et al 2016 during the monsoon season june september when the mean air temperature was 4 4 c precipitation was 1416 mm figs 2 9 the glaciers exhibit severe mass loss with a multiyear mean of 2 08 m w e fig 8 meanwhile we found that there was a clear correlation between the ablation and the mean monsoon temperature r 0 87 with the increase in air temperature ablation showed an increasing trend and the sensitivity of ablation to air temperature fluctuation was 0 46 m w e c 1 fig 9a stronger heat forcing higher air temperature and a strong rise in energy flux is considered to be more capable of continuing to warm the ice and produce higher amounts of meltwater e g vincent et al 2017 thibert et al 2018 although less attention has been paid to the impact of liquid precipitation on snow ice melting a clear correlation also exists between liquid precipitation and ablation r 0 73 that is the greater the liquid precipitation the greater the melting of the glacier surface on the brg1 fig 9b the sensitivity of ablation to liquid precipitation fluctuation was 0 22 m w e 100 mm 1 based on field observations we found several possible mechanisms that might account for this correlation the rainfall itself carries heat energy and may erode the ice body when they converge into rivers on the glacier importantly as a possible carrier they may bring the heat into the deeper zone of the glacier through the crevasse resulting in the melting of the englacial subglacial colgan et al 2016 hubbard et al 2021 in addition the water from rainfall and meltwater in surface crevasses apply hydraulic pressure on the crevasse walls and promote crevasse growth deeper into the glacier i e hydrofracture function which makes the heat forcing more powerful e g tuckett et al 2019 we therefore conclude that in addition to air temperature liquid precipitation is also an important factor driving the mass balance change of brg1 during the monsoon period a study of himalayan glacier changes also reported that liquid precipitation plays an important role in glacier melting during the ablation season fugger et al 2021 during the non monsoon season october may the mean air temperature was 3 8 c precipitation was 982 mm figs 2 9 the multi year average of accumulation on the bgr was 0 53 m w e fig 8 during this period the low temperature environment stopped the loss of glacier mass and accumulation occurred we found a weak negative correlation between the accumulation and temperature in the non monsoon period in the non monsoon period r 0 24 fig 9c the brg1 mainly gains mass accumulation in the form of solid precipitation snowfall which means that the greater the precipitation in the non monsoon period the greater the accumulation on the surface of the glacier and there should be a strong positive correlation between them although there is a positive correlation between the accumulated amount we observe and the non monsoon season precipitation the correlation is weak r 0 47 fig 9d a possible explanation is that the short term unobserved melting during the non monsoon season braithwaite 2002 was responsible for this weak correlation interestingly we note that changes in air temperature from late april to may pre monsoon play a key point in short unobserved periods of melting in the year of 2011 2012 although the amount of snowfall 1016 mm was not low fig 9d the temperature from late april to may 5 7 c was relatively higher than other years fig 2a the ablation season arrives early resulting in lower accumulation 0 42 m w e fig 8 based on the above analysis we found that when wang et al 2020 and zhang 2005 used the degree day model to simulate the mass balance of the brg1 from 1951 to 2007 only temperature driven ablation was considered i e the calculation of ice melting only relying on temperature as a parameter fig 5d in fact liquid precipitation is also driving the melting of ice and the short term unobserved melting will also occur during the non monsoon period therefore we speculate that the simulated mass value from 1951 to 2007 should be less than the actual mass loss value fig 5c in this case the accumulative mass loss of the brg1 from 1951 to 2007 exceeds 13 81 m w e combined with the actual measured accumulative mass loss 18 57 3 62 m w e fig 8 from 2008 to 2020 we infer that the accumulative mass loss of the brg1 has exceeded 32 38 3 62 m w e during the 1951 2020 period 5 2 general climatic warming on the mt yulong massif from 1951 to 2020 elevation dependent warming edw a specific concept that has been widely investigated in recent years means that the warming rate is more pronounced at high elevation pepin et al 2015 at both a local and regional scale on the tp there is evidence for elevation dependent warming i e a warming trend at higher altitudes has been found to be more pronounced over the tp gao et al 2018 yao et al 2012 with the warming rate increasing with altitude before becoming quite stable the declining slightly near the highest altitudes qin et al 2009 the rate of warming appears amplified around 4800 m asl but not above 6200 m asl an altitudinal band that encompasses the ablation elevation line of almost all glaciers on the tp gao et al 2018 qin et al 2009 warming on the tp has been found to be more pronounced in winter you et al 2010 which to some extent affects the amount and duration of glacier accumulation on the tp future projections of annual precipitation indicate that the indian monsoon is weakening swapna et al 2017 which in turn will influence changes in precipitation patterns yao et al 2012 the mt yulong massif is located on the southeastern edge of the tp and has experienced all the abovementioned aspects of climate change though to a certain extent the change seems to be more dramatic a comparative climatological analysis of mat and map values annual monsoon period mean temperature and precipitation and annual non monsoon period mean temperature and precipitation values from 1951 to 2020 on mt yulong massif is therefore given in fig 10 for the 1951 2020 period the mean temperatures were found to be 17 52 c 10 58 c and 12 91 c for the monsoon non monsoon and annual timeframes respectively fig 10 since the 1980 s a warming process has become established and has been further strengthened after 2000 fig 10 this corresponds to the acceleration in glacial retreat in the region figs 4 5 8 to ascertain the prevalence of such a warming process three periods were analyzed i e the years pre 1980 1980 2000 and post 2000 fig 10 fig 10 indicates that the mean temperatures pre 1980 for the monsoon non monsoon and annual timeframes were 17 18 c 10 26 c and 12 55 c respectively with corresponding warming rates of approximately 0 05 c 10a 0 032 c 10a and 0 037 c 10a respectively the increase in temperatures was relatively slow during 1980 2000 the mean temperatures of the monsoon non monsoon and annual stage were 17 49 c 10 38 c and 12 76 c respectively and the corresponding warming rates were approximately 0 16 c 10a 0 31 c 10a and 0 15 c 10a respectively fig 10a 10c 10e compared with the period pre 1980 the mean temperature rises rose by 0 31 c and 0 24 c in monsoon and annual period and rates 3 times and 4 times in monsoon and annual period of increase remained at a high level the mean temperatures post 2000 over the monsoon non monsoon and annual periods were 18 05 c 11 28 c and 13 57 c respectively and the corresponding warming rates were approximately 0 69 c 10a 0 32 c 10a and 0 48 c 10a respectively fig 10a c e in general the analysis of the data for 1951 2020 showed a rise in temperature during the monsoon and non monsoon seasons as well as on an annual basis the mean annual temperature changes over pre 1980 12 52 c 1980 2000 12 76 c and post 2000 13 57 c shows a stepwise increase with the warming rate after 2000 being dozens of times greater than that before 1980 compared with that before 1980 the mean monsoon temperature increases after 2000 was close 1 c 0 87 c and the mean non monsoon temperature increases after 2000 were 1 02 c temperatures particularly increased during the non monsoon season from 1951 to 2020 the annual climatological precipitation mean was recorded at 953 mm the mean precipitation values during the monsoon and non monsoon seasons were observed to be 775 mm and 182 mm respectively 81 7 of the total precipitation occurred during the monsoon period whereas 19 8 occurred during non monsoon months similarly we examined the changes in precipitation pre 1980 1980 2000 and post 2000 fig 10 indicates that the mean precipitation values pre 1980 over the monsoon non monsoon and annual periods were 770 mm 177 mm and 949 mm respectively the corresponding rates have no obvious trend of increase or decrease from 1980 to 2000 the mean precipitation values over the monsoon non monsoon and annual periods were 793 mm 186 mm and 981 mm respectively rates corresponding to approximately 120 58 mm 10a 12 34 mm 10a and 135 83 mm 10a respectively fig 10b d f precipitation showed an increasing trend during monsoon months and no clear increasing trend in non monsoon months for this period 1980 2000 mean precipitation values post 2000 over the monsoon non monsoon and annual timeframes were 758 mm 183 mm and 937 mm respectively corresponding to rates of approximately 51 75 mm 10a 24 63 mm 10a and 59 30 mm 10a respectively fig 10b d f here we noted that precipitation values over the monsoon non monsoon and annual periods appear to show a downward trend during the 2000 2020 period overall so far after a significant increase in precipitation between 1980 and 2000 the mean precipitation after 2000 has fallen back and is slightly lower than the level before 1980 fig 10 a numerical modeling study by zhu et al 2021 on naimona nyi glacier 30 27 n 81 92 e 6 050 m a s l has quantitatively shown that the current air temperature would need to be reduced by 1 1 c or precipitation increased by 49 to contain mass loss i e zero mass balance the brg1 as a temperature glacier would require a much larger decrease in temperature or increase in precipitation to reach zero mass balance than the mogannan glacier a typical sub continental glacier however the rises in temperature in the mt yulong area have become an indisputable fact and the precipitation has shown a decreasing trend in the last 20 years hence our analysis suggested that external temperature is the main driving force on glacier mass loss over interannual timescales on the basis of little change in precipitation the accelerated pace of glacier decline in the mt yulong massif over seven decades may therefore be better understood when applying this hydrothermal combination anomaly 5 3 glacial changes in typical temperate monsoon glacial regions rapid retreat and mass loss rates have characterized this and other temperate monsoon glaciers on the southeastern tp and in the hengduan mountains over the last few decades bolch et al 2019 these glaciers have all experienced negative mass balance conditions over several decades thereby greatly depleting their reserves in the central nyainqentanglha mountains 30 00 30 50 n 94 00 95 30 e the mean mass loss has been calculated to have been 0 46 0 08 m w e yr 1 with glacial coverage decreasing at a rate of 0 68 0 05 yr 1 i e 32 64 of the glaciated area disappeared during the 1968 2016 period wu et al 2018a mass losses in 2000 2016 0 60 0 20 m w e yr 1 fig 11 a showed an accelerated trend compared with that the period of 1968 2000 0 42 0 05 m w e yr 1 wu et al 2018a a similar rate of glacier contraction has been observed in the kangri karpo mountains 28 50 29 50 n 95 0 70 97 50 e with a mass loss rate of 0 46 0 08 m w e yr 1 fig 11a and a glacial coverage reduction rate of 0 71 0 06 yr 1 i e ice cover diminished by 24 9 from 1980 to 2015 wu et al 2018a there was a mean mass loss of 0 26 0 16 m w e yr 1 and 0 71 0 10 m w e yr 1 for the 1980 2000 and 2000 2014 periods respectively wu et al 2018b another comparative study from the gongga mountains 29 00 30 00 n 101 50 102 00 e calculated mass loss to be 0 42 0 07 m w e yr 1 fig 11a with a glacial coverage reduction rate of 0 67 yr 1 i e ice cover diminished by 11 3 over the 1966 2009 period zhang et al 2012 during the 2001 2009 period the mean mass balance of the hailuogou glacier studied in the gongga mountains was 0 79 m w e yr 1 2 3 times greater than that of the 1959 2000 period zhang et al 2012 compared with these temperate monsoon glacial areas we observed an even more dramatic mass loss for the glaciers on the mt yulong massif especially in the last 10 years figs 4 5 from 1951 to 2020 glacial coverage fell by 64 and on the brg1 the mean annual mass balance was 0 02 m w e yr 1 before 1980 changing to 0 54 m w e yr 1 during the 1980 2007 period fig 5d and then 1 54 m w e yr 1 between 2008 and 2020 fig 8 all these studies would suggest that such glaciers are far from being in a state of equilibrium and quickly lose a large amount of mass indeed the srocc reported that the relatively little ice cover smaller glaciers is more susceptible to rapid loss of mass compared with large scale temperature monsoon glacial regions e g the 1713 42 51 82 km2 glaciated area of the central nyainqentanglha range in 2016 wu et al 2018b the 2048 50 48 65 km2 glaciated area of the kangri karpo mountains in 2015 wu et al 2018a and the 22 85 km2 glaciated area on mt gongga in 2010 zhang et al 2015 the mt yulong massif has been less able to cope with climate change stress due to its small reserves area only 4 48 km2 in 2017 and low latitude in addition nineglaciers with an area of 1 km2 have disappeared over the past several decades fig 4a our observations would suggest that this pattern of disappearance will also affect the massif s 13 currently existing glaciers over the next few decades glacial retreat on both the global and local scale has never simply been attributed to natural phenomena as climate warming and extremely high temperature events continue and intensify the human fingerprints on extreme large scale glacier losses will become increasingly apparent in the coming decades vargo et al 2020 there is limited evidence that the increase in greenhouse gases caused by anthropogenic forcings has led to the observed changes in ice mass hirabayashi et al 2016 roe et al 2021 as the largest ski resort in china the mt yulong massif area is no exception according to statistics the number of tourists visiting yulong snow mountain was 0 1 million in 1995 and increased to 3 84 million in 2016 wang et al 2020 according to the lijiang national economic and social development statistical bulletin http www lijiang gov cn the number of tourists visiting lijiang city increased from 3 22 million in 2001 to 54 02 million in 2019 fig 11b since 2010 an intense increasing trend is discernible in the number of tourists visiting lijiang city fig 11b the thermal effect of the expansion of lijiang city fig 1a the urban area is only 25 km away from the glaciated area as well as the influx of millions of tourists brought about by the expansion of the tourist industry has undoubtedly had an inestimable impact upon levels of glacial melt in this region 6 conclusion compared with other temperate glacial areas the mt yulong massif due to its small reserves area and low latitude are less able to cope with climate forcing the glaciated area of mt yulong massif has experienced continuous shrinkage in terms of both glacial coverage and number of glaciers glacial coverage fell by 64 from 12 45 km2 in 1957 to 4 48 km2 in 2017 and nine glaciers from a total of 22 glaciers in 1957 to 13 glaciers in 2017 were lost during the 1957 2017 period for the brg1 referenced glacier its glacial coverage has decreased by 0 75 km2 a fall of 36 from 2 07 km2 in 1957 to 1 32 km2 in 2017 the glacier s length has also exhibited a generally decreasing trend i e decreasing by 750 m from 1957 to 2017 with a rate of retreat of 12 5 m yr 1 the glacier s terminus rose from 4100 m asl in 1982 to 4395 m asl in 2017 has retreated by 295 m at a mean rate of 8 4 m yr 1 and since 2010 the ela has risen above the glacier s summit at an altitude of 5050 m asl disappearing along with the accumulation zone we would attribute the observed significant glacier retreat and deficit to the undisputed regional climatic warming through in situ measurements over the 2008 2020 periods we found that accumulation of snow with a multiyear mean of 0 53 0 08 m w e during the non monsoon season was far from able to offset any increases in ablation during the monsoon season with a multiyear mean of 2 08 0 20 m w e the glacier was not therefore in equilibrium and rapidly lost mass with multiyear mean mass losses of 1 54 0 30 m w e cumulative mass losses of 18 57 3 62 m w e given that the ablation driven by both air temperature and liquid precipitation in the monsoon season has a significant impact on mass losses the imbalance between insufficient accumulation and enhanced melting at a seasonal scale provides an explanation for understanding mass losses over longer timescales combining the simulated value from 1951 to 2007 with accumulative mass loss 13 81 m w e the simulated value may be smaller than the actual value because the influence of liquid precipitation on ablation is not taken into account and the in situ measurements during 2008 2020 period with cumulative mass losses of 18 57 3 62 m w e we infer that the cumulative mass losses of brg1 has exceeded 32 38 3 62 m w e over the 1951 2020 period in 1980 there was a rapid change the aforementioned retreat was further strengthened and the loss of mass became more intense post 2000 the mean annual mass balance was 0 02 m w e yr 1 before 1980 changing to 0 54 m w e yr 1 during the 1980 2007 period and then 1 54 m w e yr 1 between 2008 and 2020 recorded climate data indicate that it is unlikely that the current atmospheric conditions will allow brg1 to reverse its loss trend and reach zero mass balance declaration of competing interest the
