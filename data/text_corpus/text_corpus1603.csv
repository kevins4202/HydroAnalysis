8015,study region ishim tobol river basin northern kazakhstan study focus in this study an ensemble reconstruction of the june july streamflow from the ishim tobor river was carried out using random forest rf k nearest neighbor knn and multiple linear regression mlr models the reliability of the ensemble reconstruction was verified by a comparison with other regional reconstructions and historical records a correlation analysis and vapor fluxes were applied to visualize the significant influence of atmospheric circulation on the study area the cumulative distribution functions cdfs examined the distribution of the high low flows highlighted by the reconstruction new hydrological insights for the region our study analyzes the application of machine learning algorithms and a traditional mlr model to hydrological reconstruction the single model reconstruction contained information and results on streamflow variability were not sufficient consequently we integrated the three models into the ensemble reconstruction the extended streamflow record reveals the basin s hydrological changes over the past 229 years from 1788 2016 the reconstructed streamflow was perennially below the mean value which indicates more prominent drought and water deficit conditions within the basin this phenomenon was significantly influenced by water vapor transport from the north atlantic and arctic oceans if future climate scenarios lead to drought in the basin then surface water demand will not be satisfied for 7 out of 10 years keywords machine learning tree rings ishim river tobol river streamflow reconstruction 1 introduction central asia is located in the hinterland of eurasia and is characterized by an uneven distribution of water resources and numerous transboundary rivers chen et al 2020 hu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 surface water resources are the primary water supply source in central asia and surface water is thus crucial for sustainable economic and social development in this region greve et al 2018 malsy et al 2012 in recent years due to the development of agricultural and industrial production urbanization and population growth the issue of ensuring a sustainable supply of water resources has become increasingly concerning lee and jung 2018 at the same time central asian countries are also engaging in debates regarding the exploitation of water resources and water pollution in transboundary rivers leng et al 2021 zhiltsov et al 2018 accordingly studying the rivers in the arid region of central asia is helpful for scientifically solving water resource related problems and formulating policies regarding water resources kazakhstan is the largest landlocked country in the world with a continental climate and approximately 39 000 rivers didovets et al 2021 although the climate in kazakhstan is dry and the country experiences little rainfall floods occur each year due to continuous rainfall snow melt and other factors stoyashcheva and rybkina 2014 the occurrence of floods is closely linked to global and regional climate change data reported in several studies suggest that the summer and winter temperatures in central asia have shown increasingly apparent upward trends in recent decades lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 xu et al 2018 increases in temperature directly lead to reduced snow cover storage and the depletion of glaciers which affect the occurrence of extreme flooding or dry events chen et al 2021 shen et al 2017 these factors can not only threaten the safety of the people in kazakhstan but also severely damage the local agricultural and water conservancy infrastructure therefore an enhanced understanding of regional historical hydrological characteristics and climate change mechanisms in kazakhstan is urgent for assessing current water resource security and management plans brown et al 2015 ceola et al 2016 viviroli et al 2011 however the currently available short term hydrologic monitoring records limit our ability to study hydrologic variabilities over historical periods to extend the duration of streamflow records high resolution proxy data can be used tree rings have been proven to be effective hydroclimatic proxy data because of their wide spatial distribution high resolution long timescales and sensitivity to hydroclimatic conditions cook et al 2013 rao et al 2020 xu et al 2017 studies published thus far have suggested that tree ring reconstruction research in kazakhstan has increased rapidly over the past decade akkemik et al 2020 reconstructed precipitation from october of the previous year to july of the current year in northern kazakhstan and found that the occurrence of extreme weather events in the burabai region has shown an increasing trend in recent decades zhang et al 2017 demonstrated that changes in precipitation might be related to large scale climate oscillations in southern kazakhstan mazarzhanova et al 2017 reconstructed historical fires in northern kazakhstan and indicated that the effects of fires on tree growth lasted 1 8 years furthermore chen et al 2012 used siberian larch tree rings to reconstruct warm season temperatures from june to august in the zajsan lake area and illustrated widespread large scale climate forcing in central asia however few studies have reconstructed streamflow in this region and most tree ring reconstruction work has been based on linear regression models it has now been well established by a variety of studies that the relations among tree rings streamflow and climate change might be nonlinear gea izquierdo et al 2011 graumlich 1993 griesbauer et al 2011 speed et al 2011 in particular the forests in central asia have undergone strong impacts from climate change and human activities based on this nonlinearity new statistical methods can be used to solve the shortcomings of linear regression methods and improve the reconstruction accuracy gangopadhyay et al 2009 reconstructed a 605 year streamflow of the colorado river using a k nearest neighbor knn nonparametric method jevšenak et al 2018 confirmed the applicability of a nonlinear artificial neural network regression model that reconstructed the temperature from tree rings even so the use of tree ring data to improve reconstruction accuracies requires further research random forest rf is an integrated machine learning algorithm that can capture complex nonlinear relationships among variables breiman 2001 in particular rf has better tolerances to abnormal values and noise processing than other algorithms li et al 2019a in contrast to traditional multilinear regression models rfs are composed of multiple decision trees tang and ishwaran 2017 when dealing with samples the rf can automatically distinguish whether a classification or regression should be applied as a result it is regarded as a representative ensemble learning model rf models have been applied in many fields such as ecological research evans et al 2011 fox et al 2017 flood risk assessments eng et al 2013 li et al 2019b pham et al 2020 and future climate prediction assessments lawler et al 2006 pang et al 2017 nevertheless rfs have seldom been used in tree ring reconstructions the aims of this study are to 1 use tree ring width measurements as a proxy indicator for hydroclimatic conditions by applying three regression models to ensemble reconstructions of the streamflow of the ishim tobol river over the past two centuries 2 explore the long term hydrological changes and analyze the current status of the streamflow of the studied river 3 analyze the correlation between tree ring growth and hydrological climate change and 4 search for links between streamflow variabilities and large scale climate forcings this study can provide basic data for water resource management and hydraulic engineering construction applications improve future water risk predictions and provide an optimal accurate extended streamflow record 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the ishim river and tobol river ishim tobol river originate in north central kazakhstan and flow northward into russia where they join the irtysh river and eventually reach the arctic ocean the sampling site is located in the national forest park in the burabai region of northern kazakhstan the park covers an area of 1 30 105 hm2 and comprises a large number of animal and plant species the main tree species in the forest are pinus sylvestris 65 betula pendula l 31 populus tremula l 3 and shrubs 1 akkemik et al 2020 there are also 14 lakes in the park including bolshoye shchuchye and borovoye petrova and sultangazina 2015 the climate in the study area is temperate and continental with hot summers and severe winters eremeeva and leonova 2020 the temperatures are relatively high in summer with the highest temperature in july reaching 40 c and the lowest temperature from december to january reaching 23 c the annual average precipitation in the study area is 295 mm fig 3 and the maximum precipitation occurs in summer and early autumn summer and autumn rains often occur in the form of showers accompanied by thunderstorms the average snow cover depth in winter is 25 35 mm and snow is unevenly distributed and deposited by blizzards akiyanova et al 2019 spring is short in the study area 20 30 days and usually begins in the second half of april however spring including march april and may is often characterized by extremely cold weather that prevents snow from melting and dew from forming yapiyev et al 2017 even in may and early june large areas of frost can be observed in the study area frost occurs between 100 and 150 days per year 2 2 sampling and chronology development tree ring samples were collected from six different sites in the burabai region fig 1 two cores were taken from each tree using increment borers only one core was sampled from a small number of trees in total 263 samples were obtained from 143 trees at a total of six sites most cores were sampled from scots pine p sylvestris and a few were sampled from silver birch b pendula l in accordance with the basic tree ring analysis procedure the tree ring cores were fixed in a wood trough naturally air dried and sanded the width of each tree ring was measured using the cdendro 9 4 analysis system highly accurate tree age and ring width data were obtained by cross dating with the cofecha program holmes 1983 the tree ring width chronology was produced using the arstan program cook 1985 after comparing and analyzing the original sequence and testing different fitting methods the negative exponential regression function was selected to eliminate the growth trend of the tree for the individual growth trends that did not conform to the negative exponential function curve a friedman smoothing curve was fitted to the sequence to reduce the noise caused by any individual tree following this method we obtained three types of chronologies standard std residual res and arstan ars chronologies in total chronologies were constructed for six sites since the sample of constructed chronologies was composed of two tree species the consistency of climate response was checked for scots pine and silver birch through the correlation analysis of the six chronologies and climate factors the results and chronological statistical characteristics showed relatively consistent climatic responses of the two tree species table 1 the brb1 and brb2 chronologies were highly correlated and their linear distances and growing environments were extremely close after comprehensive consideration the brb1 and brb2 chronologies were combined into a regional chronology similarly as1 as2 ash and xq1 were combined into another regional chronology fig 2 the residual version of the regional chronology removes the autocorrelation of all tree samples through autoregressive modeling and has a significant correlation with the hydrological data accordingly we selected the residual version of the two regional chronologies for further analysis rc1 and rc2 table 1 shows the values of the statistical characteristics for all chronologies high snr 92 39 and 70 13 and eps 0 99 and 0 99 values indicated that there was a stronger climate signal in rc1 and rc2 high ms 0 26 and 0 33 and sd 0 22 and 0 29 suggested a more sensitive response to climate these results imply that the chronologies fitted by the two tree species are reliable finally the regional residual chronology with an expressed population signal eps above 0 85 was used to reconstruct the streamflow from 1788 to 2016 fig 4 2 3 hydrological and meteorological data there are a large number of missing data from the four meteorological stations near the sampling site especially the data from 2001 to 2016 which are almost blank therefore we collected monthly average temperature and precipitation data from the climate research unit cru time series ts 4 04 51 54 n 68 72 e 1901 2016 http climexp knmi nl the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and palmer drought severity index pdsi data from the nearest grid 51 54 n 68 72 e were obtained at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 1901 2016 previous studies have demonstrated the applicability and reliability of cru data in the burabai region akkemik et al 2020 mazarzhanova et al 2017 one streamflow dataset was obtained from the kostanai hydrologic station 53 11 n 63 37 e 1967 2016 170 m a s l which measures the upper and middle reaches of the tobol river the other streamflow dataset was collected from the petropavlovsk hydrologic station 54 49 n 69 09 e 1967 2016 142 m a s l which measures the middle and lower reaches of the ishim river during the measurement period the positions and types of the measuring instruments at the two hydrological stations did not change since both rivers are tributaries of the lower irtysh river and are relatively close to one another the streamflow of the two rivers was combined for further analyses studies have shown that the formation of tree rings is affected not only by hydrological climatic conditions that occur during the growth periods of trees but also by conditions that occur before the growing season barber et al 2000 cook et al 2000 consequently we analyzed different combinations of monthly hydrometeorological data 2 4 analytical method rf is an improved decision tree algorithm model breiman 2001 zhou et al 2020 the principle of the program algorithm is as follows input the sample data into d f 1 x f 2 x f i x where i represents the variables of the sample including rc1 rc2 and streamflow data randomly select m samples from the sample data to obtain the training data d t f m 1 x f m 2 x f mi x select j j i variables at random from the i variables the i variables include rc1 and rc2 the predictor variable is set to the streamflow data establish a decision tree select the best split point of the j variables assuming that the decision tree is represented as t t 1 t 2 t j the training set d t is used to train the decision tree the outputs represent the resulting data y t m 1 x t m 2 x t mj x in the training process each node of the decision tree is split into two daughter nodes the sampling and training processes are repeated until the user defined number of trees is reached in this paper the rf package of the python 3 scikit learn library was used for rf modeling https scikit learn org stable nelli 2018 the rf model has five important parameters specifically n estimators max depth min samples leaf min samples split and max features bisong 2019 the n estimators refers to the number of trees in the rf and is used to improve the predictive accuracy and control overfitting the max depth denotes the maximum depth of the decision tree the min samples leaf and min samples split represent the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node and the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node respectively the max features refers to the number of variables to consider paper 2020 after parameter tuning we set the n estimators to 204 max depth to 3 max features to 2 and min samples leaf and min samples split to 1 and 2 respectively multiple linear regression mlr and knn were also used to reconstruct the streamflow of the ishim tobol river and their results were compared to the rf model results knn is a simple and effective machine learning algorithm based on the nearest neighbor rule mlr is one of the traditional regression analysis methods the knn package of the python 3 scikit learn library was used for knn modeling https scikit learn org stable the parameter k in the knn model was set to 8 the final sequence used for analysis resulted from the ensemble reconstruction of the three models fig 5 shows the framework illustration of our research first a correlation analysis between the two regional residual chronologies and the streamflow data of the ishim tobol river from 1967 to 2016 was carried out the results showed that the two regional residual chronologies were significantly correlated with the cumulative streamflow of the ishim tobol river in june july p 0 01 which indicates that the two regional residual chronologies could be used to reconstruct streamflow second after a strict analysis and verification three reconstruction models were established by applying two regional residual chronologies as variables and the data recorded on the ishim tobol river as predictor variables the pearson correlation coefficient r explained variance r2 reduction in error re product means test pmt sign test st nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the three regression models and the low pass filter values were calculated to show the low frequency range variation of the reconstruction the spatial representation of the reconstruction was analyzed with a spatial correlation analysis and the multitaper mtm spectral analysis method therrell et al 2006 and a wavelet analysis torrence and compo 1998 were applied to assess the periodicity tendencies in the reconstruction furthermore the reconstruction was related to large scale atmospheric circulation patterns and we analyzed the 850 hpa vapor fluxes for 5 extreme drought events and 5 extreme flood events between 1950 and 2016 3 results 3 1 chronology and climate growth linkage the rc1 and rc2 chronologies were positively correlated with the monthly mean temperature from october to march but negatively correlated with the monthly mean temperature from april to july fig 6 the temperature in the study area began to rise in march and both the warm environment and melting snow had a positive effect on the growth of trees nevertheless a counter effect was observed from april to july extremely high temperatures in late spring and early summer caused trees to display narrow annual rings barnett et al 2005 jonas et al 2008 kopabayeva et al 2017 the precipitation from october of the previous year to july of the current year had a positive effect on the tree ring width and this effect was amplified in april and june p 0 05 the growth of trees in central asia is affected not only by climatic factors during the growing season but also by the precipitation and temperature conditions before the early period of the growing season jiang et al 2020 wang et al 2006 the study area experiences less precipitation in winter and spring which has no significant impact on the growth of trees the cumulative summer precipitation is 133 30 mm which accounts for 42 01 of the annual cumulative precipitation the increase in precipitation during this period improves the soil moisture content and compensates for the water deficiencies caused by high temperatures bell et al 2010 berg et al 2016 the high correlations among the spei pdsi and tree ring width index validate this concept the correlations between the tree ring width index and hydroclimatic factors were significant in june p 0 05 here a narrow ring is defined as a tree ring width index lower than the average minus the standard deviation in the same way a wide ring is defined as a tree ring width index higher than the average plus the standard deviation we counted the shared years in both the rc1 and rc2 chronologies with above average temperatures and below average precipitation in june from 1967 to 2016 and found probabilities of narrow tree rings of 86 67 and 80 0 respectively in contrast when temperatures were below average and precipitation was above average the probabilities of wide tree rings being measured were 72 73 and 63 64 respectively this phenomenon illustrates that the temperature and precipitation conditions in june significantly affect the growth of trees and the streamflow precipitation recharge is the direct source of streamflow in summer and indirectly affects the growth of trees through the soil moreover streamflow variations eliminate the independent influence of the local microclimate and can better reflect the overall situation of the analyzed basin wagesho et al 2012 yin et al 2008 we screened the rc1 and rc2 chronologies against streamflow for various seasonal combinations of monthly yields and found a maximum correlation from june to july p 0 01 when the optimal seasonal window was expanded the correlation showed a downward trend therefore the streamflow from june to july is the best quota of the predictor variable 3 2 streamflow reconstruction the reconstruction result of the rf model differed every time that the model was run as each decision tree was constructed by randomly drawing training samples from the original data yang et al 2016 it is possible that some samples are considered in decision tree training more than once and that some samples are not considered at all millard and richardson 2015 data anti jamming is an advantage of the rf model and the randomly selected sample data of each tree has no additional impact on the overall evaluation despite all of this the result of one reconstruction is still uncertain based on this information we reconstructed the rf model 10 000 times and the average sequence obtained through these 10 000 reconstructions was used as the final result to evaluate the effects of the rf knn and mlr models we compared the streamflow of the instrument during the observation period with the output values of the three models the mlr model is as follows y 64 12 r c 1 30 03 r c 2 37 31 where rc1 represents the rc1 regional residual chronology rc2 denotes the rc2 regional residual chronology and y signifies the average streamflow from june to july in the ishim tobol river fig 7 shows that during the calibration and verification periods the outputs of the three streamflow reconstruction models matched well with the observed data and the first order difference analyses demonstrated the same results table 2 lists the statistical characteristics of the rf knn and mlr models during the calibration and verification periods the rf models in fig 7 and table 2 are the average values after 10 000 operations we found that the correlation coefficient and explained variance were the highest for the rf model which indicates that the rf regression model was better than the other reconstruction models regarding the pmt and re values the three models all passed the significance tests in the sign test the rf and knn models showed better performance than the mlr model which confirms that the rf and knn models had better consistency in modeling low frequency variations as determined by analyzing the rmse and nse values of the three models the predictions of the rf model were closest to the observed values although the comprehensive performance of the rf model shows better reconstruction ability it may only be a marginal edge advantage accordingly to retain more reconstruction information and results we integrated the rf knn and mlr models for ensemble reconstruction this new sequence is obtained by the arithmetic average processing of three models and is used for subsequent analysis and discussion 3 3 streamflow characteristics of the ensemble reconstruction the ensemble reconstruction of the ishim tobol river streamflow provides important hydrological information for the northern region of kazakhstan fig 8 to investigate extremely high and low streamflow years in the reconstructed data we defined extremely high streamflow as reconstruction values above the mean σ and extremely low streamflow as reconstruction values below the mean σ gou et al 2010 this process resulted in a total of 37 extremely high streamflow years and 39 extremely low streamflow years in the ishim tobol river between 1788 and 2016 table 3 in addition the occurrence of a dry wet period was determined if the low pass filtered reconstruction values were continuously lower higher than the long term average for 10 years we found that dry periods occurred from 1831 to 1846 1863 1878 1892 1905 and 1950 1971 and wet periods were identified from 1792 to 1803 1821 1830 1847 1862 1920 1931 and 1985 1995 the mtm analysis detected several main periodicities in the reconstructed streamflow data 2 8 3 2 years and 2 year periodicities at the 0 05 significance level fig 9a the wavelet analysis results supported many of the findings of the mtm analysis fig 9b and indicated that the most significant periodicity in the streamflow reconstruction occurred at a period of 2 8 3 2 years in addition we used cru self calibrating pdsi grid data to analyze the spatial correlation between the observed and reconstructed streamflow data from 1967 to 2016 the results revealed a high spatial correlation between the reconstructed fig 9c and observed fig 9d pdsi grid data the regions with the highest correlation values are located in the middle and lower plains of the ishim tobol river basin 4 discussion 4 1 regional comparison two other reconstruction sequences were available as comparisons to study the temporal and spatial variabilities in large scale hydroclimatic conditions fig 10 one dataset was based on pdsi reconstruction selected grid cell 51 54 n 68 72 e spatial resolution 2 5 2 5 from tree rings in asia cook et al 2010 the other dataset comprised reconstructed precipitation in the burabai region from october of the previous year to july of the current year akkemik et al 2020 over the past two centuries the precipitation reconstruction from the burabai region r 0 41 n 200 p 0 01 and the pdsi reconstruction r 0 25 n 200 p 0 01 both showed high correlations with the ishim tobol river streamflow reconstruction obtained in this study the graphical comparisons displayed similar high low streamflow episodes in common periods under different reconstructions as illustrated in fig 10 the 1810 s 1830 1840 s 1870 s 1910 s 1950 s and 1960 s intervals represented episodes with notably low streamflow while the 1800 s 1820 s 1850 s and 1970 1980 s were identified as high streamflow episodes under all reconstructions over the past two centuries the period from 1831 to 1846 was indicated as a long drought duration in the reconstructions and a corresponding drought trend has also been reported in northern kyrgyzstan zhang et al 2020 it is suggested that the hydrological change in our study area is connected to the other region during this drought period the kazakh nationality had numerous uprisings against the domination of the tsar the most notable among them was the 1836 uprising which lasted the longest and corresponded to an extremely low streamflow in 1836 which suggests a possible link between drought and the development of civilization kasenov 2014 the great famine in kazakhstan 1931 1933 was caused by agricultural collectivization and the extended aridity corresponded to a drought period as identified by our reconstructions janmaat 2006 in addition the great famine of 1921 in the ural region corresponded to an extreme drought year in our reconstructions katzer 2005 interestingly the ishim tobol river streamflow has increased since 1970 and the regional climate appears to have shifted from warm and dry to warm and wet this variation reflects the connection with global warming chen et al 2016 zou et al 2021 4 2 streamflow and atmospheric general circulation the main periodic variations observed in the streamflow of the ishim tobol river were related to the north atlantic oscillation nao and quasi biennial oscillation qbo which indicates an association between atmospheric general circulation and streamflow in central asia bothe et al 2012 sauer et al 2021 we analyzed the correlation between the reconstructed ishim tobol river streamflow and the nao index cook et al 1998 and found a strong positive correlation r 0 40 n 193 p 0 01 fig 11a the wavelet analysis showed a significant correlation on the quasi 3 7 16 and 32 year scales during the common period from 1788 to 1980 fig 11b the arrows in fig 11b show the positive correlation identified from 1825 to 1890 however an inverse correlation was found during the 1950 s on an approximately 16 year time scale this variation was presumably due to interannual oscillations of the nao central asia is located in the region of influence of the subpolar westerlies and precipitation is mainly influenced by westerly circulation patterns in this region aizen et al 2001 wang et al 2020 central asia is also an essential corridor for the latitudinal transport of water vapor from the atlantic and arctic oceans which affects the intensity of water vapor entering china s arid areas from 1950 2016 we selected 5 extremely high streamflow years 1987 1990 1993 2007 and 2015 figs 11c and 5 extremely low streamflow years 1955 1968 1969 1998 and 2012 fig 11d to conduct a vapor flux analysis we found that during humid years warm and humid air currents from the north atlantic ocean and arctic ocean affected the study area which induced increased precipitation and streamflow while in dry years the north atlantic air current could not reach the inland area and the study area was thus significantly affected by continental air currents that often resulted in drought events this relationship is associated with the nao during the positive phase of the nao the subpolar westerlies are oriented northerly and are stronger and the zonal water vapor gradient increases which increases vapor flux transport in central asia and china s arid areas chen et al 2013 gerlitz et al 2016 in the negative nao phase water vapor and precipitation are reduced due to water flux divergence hu et al 2017 furthermore historical records indicate that drought events have occurred in northwest china during the negative phases of the nao lee and zhang 2011 li and zhang 2015 4 3 implications for water resource management at present the water resource issues within the ishim tobol river basin mainly include transboundary water resource management water pollution and water scarcities krasnoyarova et al 2019 ospanov et al 2020 yunussova and mosiej 2016 the basin is located in the northern part of kazakhstan in a concentrated population area with intensive agricultural and industrial production activities and severe water pollution problems alimbaev et al 2020 karatayev et al 2017 the primary pollutants in this region are heavy metals and organic matter introduced from anthropogenic sources these pollutants seriously threaten the utilization of surface water resources in the basin zinoviev et al 2020 to further analyze the supply of surface water resources in the basin we compared the reconstructed streamflow data of the ishim tobol river with instrumentally recorded data according to the streamflow reconstructions and the cumulative distribution function of the dry period streamflow data the probability that the streamflow did not correspond to the multiyear average over the last two centuries was 64 19 while the probability that the dry period streamflow did not correspond to the multiyear average was 82 99 fig 11e in addition we calculated that 63 76 of the years in the reconstructed period had values below the multiyear average which indicates that the basin is in a perennial water shortage situation and that anthropogenic water use has exceeded the threshold value limited by streamflow therefore the surface water demand in the basin will not be met for 7 out of 10 years if future changes in climate scenarios result in low streamflow periods notably solving the problems of pollution and water scarcity is critical for water resource management in the region if these issues continue to increase in parallel then the sustainable development of kazakhstan will be adversely affected instrumentally recorded streamflow periods are short and reconstructed streamflow changes can represent actual streamflow data to thus provide scientific information for water resource forecasting and the development of management policies 4 4 limitations and wider implications in this study the ensemble reconstruction of the three models indicated the course of the ishim tobor river streamflow over the past two centuries beyond this the comparative analysis of the three models reflects their performance in tree ring reconstruction in particular the rf algorithm has rarely been used in reconstruction work and it has a superior advantage in addressing nonlinear factor relationships li et al 2019a for example factors such as temperature precipitation and soil moisture could be incorporated into proxy indicators for reconstruction the application of the rf algorithm should be considered a suitable extension our study demonstrates the applicability and reliability of ensemble reconstruction from the rf algorithm knn algorithm and mlr in central asia which should not be limited to the current region this paper can provide a methodological reference for the study of hydrological variation in other areas and expand it to watershed studies in coastal plains or inland plateaus the process of basin hydrology variation is a complex and nonlinear process feng et al 2020 ouali et al 2016 factors such as the number of populations irrigated land urban area and water conservancy facilities affects the hydrological variability in the basin fig 12 the ishim tobor river is dominated by snowmelt as a source of recharge which limits our ability to explore rivers where alpine glacial meltwater or groundwater is the primary source of recharge nevertheless our study can provide a broader perspective for other regional river studies that can be applied in hydrological modeling the approach explored in this paper is limited to the utilization of tree ring indicators to reconstruct hydrologic variation future studies should focus on understanding the impact of human activities on watersheds and expanding the range of reconstructed indicators 5 conclusion the streamflow of the ishim tobol river from 1788 to 2016 in the kazakh uplands was reconstructed using tree ring data and verifies that the radial growth of trees in the studied basin is dominated by precipitation and temperature by comparing the utilized rf model with the knn and mlr models the rf model was found to perform better when reconstructing streamflow but this may only be the manifestation of superior edges to include more information and results in the sequence the three models were integrated for ensemble reconstruction between 1788 and 2016 the ishim tobol river experienced five high streamflow periods and four low streamflow periods we identified several cycles with periods of 2 8 3 2 and 2 years in the ensemble reconstruction the 1836 uprising and the great famines of 1921 and 1931 1933 were documented in the reconstructed data obtained in this study which shows a connection with civilization the wavelet analysis and correlation revealed that the nao is a possible natural forcing factor that influences the variation in the ishim tobol river streamflow the vapor flux analysis indicated that the study area is mainly influenced by warm and humid airflow from the arctic and atlantic oceans in high streamflow years while in low streamflow years the study area is influenced by continental airflows by comparing it with other reconstructions we further verify the reliability and authenticity of the ensemble reconstruction our study demonstrates the applicability to central asia of tree ring reconstruction using machine learning algorithms such ensemble reconstructions should be extended to other regions and the reconstruction metrics should not be limited to a single variable the factors that affect hydrological variability within a watershed include forces such as natural forcing and human activities simple linear relationships are not sufficient to express this complex variability quantitative studies of the nonlinear relationships among the factors within a watershed need to be

8015,study region ishim tobol river basin northern kazakhstan study focus in this study an ensemble reconstruction of the june july streamflow from the ishim tobor river was carried out using random forest rf k nearest neighbor knn and multiple linear regression mlr models the reliability of the ensemble reconstruction was verified by a comparison with other regional reconstructions and historical records a correlation analysis and vapor fluxes were applied to visualize the significant influence of atmospheric circulation on the study area the cumulative distribution functions cdfs examined the distribution of the high low flows highlighted by the reconstruction new hydrological insights for the region our study analyzes the application of machine learning algorithms and a traditional mlr model to hydrological reconstruction the single model reconstruction contained information and results on streamflow variability were not sufficient consequently we integrated the three models into the ensemble reconstruction the extended streamflow record reveals the basin s hydrological changes over the past 229 years from 1788 2016 the reconstructed streamflow was perennially below the mean value which indicates more prominent drought and water deficit conditions within the basin this phenomenon was significantly influenced by water vapor transport from the north atlantic and arctic oceans if future climate scenarios lead to drought in the basin then surface water demand will not be satisfied for 7 out of 10 years keywords machine learning tree rings ishim river tobol river streamflow reconstruction 1 introduction central asia is located in the hinterland of eurasia and is characterized by an uneven distribution of water resources and numerous transboundary rivers chen et al 2020 hu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 surface water resources are the primary water supply source in central asia and surface water is thus crucial for sustainable economic and social development in this region greve et al 2018 malsy et al 2012 in recent years due to the development of agricultural and industrial production urbanization and population growth the issue of ensuring a sustainable supply of water resources has become increasingly concerning lee and jung 2018 at the same time central asian countries are also engaging in debates regarding the exploitation of water resources and water pollution in transboundary rivers leng et al 2021 zhiltsov et al 2018 accordingly studying the rivers in the arid region of central asia is helpful for scientifically solving water resource related problems and formulating policies regarding water resources kazakhstan is the largest landlocked country in the world with a continental climate and approximately 39 000 rivers didovets et al 2021 although the climate in kazakhstan is dry and the country experiences little rainfall floods occur each year due to continuous rainfall snow melt and other factors stoyashcheva and rybkina 2014 the occurrence of floods is closely linked to global and regional climate change data reported in several studies suggest that the summer and winter temperatures in central asia have shown increasingly apparent upward trends in recent decades lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 xu et al 2018 increases in temperature directly lead to reduced snow cover storage and the depletion of glaciers which affect the occurrence of extreme flooding or dry events chen et al 2021 shen et al 2017 these factors can not only threaten the safety of the people in kazakhstan but also severely damage the local agricultural and water conservancy infrastructure therefore an enhanced understanding of regional historical hydrological characteristics and climate change mechanisms in kazakhstan is urgent for assessing current water resource security and management plans brown et al 2015 ceola et al 2016 viviroli et al 2011 however the currently available short term hydrologic monitoring records limit our ability to study hydrologic variabilities over historical periods to extend the duration of streamflow records high resolution proxy data can be used tree rings have been proven to be effective hydroclimatic proxy data because of their wide spatial distribution high resolution long timescales and sensitivity to hydroclimatic conditions cook et al 2013 rao et al 2020 xu et al 2017 studies published thus far have suggested that tree ring reconstruction research in kazakhstan has increased rapidly over the past decade akkemik et al 2020 reconstructed precipitation from october of the previous year to july of the current year in northern kazakhstan and found that the occurrence of extreme weather events in the burabai region has shown an increasing trend in recent decades zhang et al 2017 demonstrated that changes in precipitation might be related to large scale climate oscillations in southern kazakhstan mazarzhanova et al 2017 reconstructed historical fires in northern kazakhstan and indicated that the effects of fires on tree growth lasted 1 8 years furthermore chen et al 2012 used siberian larch tree rings to reconstruct warm season temperatures from june to august in the zajsan lake area and illustrated widespread large scale climate forcing in central asia however few studies have reconstructed streamflow in this region and most tree ring reconstruction work has been based on linear regression models it has now been well established by a variety of studies that the relations among tree rings streamflow and climate change might be nonlinear gea izquierdo et al 2011 graumlich 1993 griesbauer et al 2011 speed et al 2011 in particular the forests in central asia have undergone strong impacts from climate change and human activities based on this nonlinearity new statistical methods can be used to solve the shortcomings of linear regression methods and improve the reconstruction accuracy gangopadhyay et al 2009 reconstructed a 605 year streamflow of the colorado river using a k nearest neighbor knn nonparametric method jevšenak et al 2018 confirmed the applicability of a nonlinear artificial neural network regression model that reconstructed the temperature from tree rings even so the use of tree ring data to improve reconstruction accuracies requires further research random forest rf is an integrated machine learning algorithm that can capture complex nonlinear relationships among variables breiman 2001 in particular rf has better tolerances to abnormal values and noise processing than other algorithms li et al 2019a in contrast to traditional multilinear regression models rfs are composed of multiple decision trees tang and ishwaran 2017 when dealing with samples the rf can automatically distinguish whether a classification or regression should be applied as a result it is regarded as a representative ensemble learning model rf models have been applied in many fields such as ecological research evans et al 2011 fox et al 2017 flood risk assessments eng et al 2013 li et al 2019b pham et al 2020 and future climate prediction assessments lawler et al 2006 pang et al 2017 nevertheless rfs have seldom been used in tree ring reconstructions the aims of this study are to 1 use tree ring width measurements as a proxy indicator for hydroclimatic conditions by applying three regression models to ensemble reconstructions of the streamflow of the ishim tobol river over the past two centuries 2 explore the long term hydrological changes and analyze the current status of the streamflow of the studied river 3 analyze the correlation between tree ring growth and hydrological climate change and 4 search for links between streamflow variabilities and large scale climate forcings this study can provide basic data for water resource management and hydraulic engineering construction applications improve future water risk predictions and provide an optimal accurate extended streamflow record 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the ishim river and tobol river ishim tobol river originate in north central kazakhstan and flow northward into russia where they join the irtysh river and eventually reach the arctic ocean the sampling site is located in the national forest park in the burabai region of northern kazakhstan the park covers an area of 1 30 105 hm2 and comprises a large number of animal and plant species the main tree species in the forest are pinus sylvestris 65 betula pendula l 31 populus tremula l 3 and shrubs 1 akkemik et al 2020 there are also 14 lakes in the park including bolshoye shchuchye and borovoye petrova and sultangazina 2015 the climate in the study area is temperate and continental with hot summers and severe winters eremeeva and leonova 2020 the temperatures are relatively high in summer with the highest temperature in july reaching 40 c and the lowest temperature from december to january reaching 23 c the annual average precipitation in the study area is 295 mm fig 3 and the maximum precipitation occurs in summer and early autumn summer and autumn rains often occur in the form of showers accompanied by thunderstorms the average snow cover depth in winter is 25 35 mm and snow is unevenly distributed and deposited by blizzards akiyanova et al 2019 spring is short in the study area 20 30 days and usually begins in the second half of april however spring including march april and may is often characterized by extremely cold weather that prevents snow from melting and dew from forming yapiyev et al 2017 even in may and early june large areas of frost can be observed in the study area frost occurs between 100 and 150 days per year 2 2 sampling and chronology development tree ring samples were collected from six different sites in the burabai region fig 1 two cores were taken from each tree using increment borers only one core was sampled from a small number of trees in total 263 samples were obtained from 143 trees at a total of six sites most cores were sampled from scots pine p sylvestris and a few were sampled from silver birch b pendula l in accordance with the basic tree ring analysis procedure the tree ring cores were fixed in a wood trough naturally air dried and sanded the width of each tree ring was measured using the cdendro 9 4 analysis system highly accurate tree age and ring width data were obtained by cross dating with the cofecha program holmes 1983 the tree ring width chronology was produced using the arstan program cook 1985 after comparing and analyzing the original sequence and testing different fitting methods the negative exponential regression function was selected to eliminate the growth trend of the tree for the individual growth trends that did not conform to the negative exponential function curve a friedman smoothing curve was fitted to the sequence to reduce the noise caused by any individual tree following this method we obtained three types of chronologies standard std residual res and arstan ars chronologies in total chronologies were constructed for six sites since the sample of constructed chronologies was composed of two tree species the consistency of climate response was checked for scots pine and silver birch through the correlation analysis of the six chronologies and climate factors the results and chronological statistical characteristics showed relatively consistent climatic responses of the two tree species table 1 the brb1 and brb2 chronologies were highly correlated and their linear distances and growing environments were extremely close after comprehensive consideration the brb1 and brb2 chronologies were combined into a regional chronology similarly as1 as2 ash and xq1 were combined into another regional chronology fig 2 the residual version of the regional chronology removes the autocorrelation of all tree samples through autoregressive modeling and has a significant correlation with the hydrological data accordingly we selected the residual version of the two regional chronologies for further analysis rc1 and rc2 table 1 shows the values of the statistical characteristics for all chronologies high snr 92 39 and 70 13 and eps 0 99 and 0 99 values indicated that there was a stronger climate signal in rc1 and rc2 high ms 0 26 and 0 33 and sd 0 22 and 0 29 suggested a more sensitive response to climate these results imply that the chronologies fitted by the two tree species are reliable finally the regional residual chronology with an expressed population signal eps above 0 85 was used to reconstruct the streamflow from 1788 to 2016 fig 4 2 3 hydrological and meteorological data there are a large number of missing data from the four meteorological stations near the sampling site especially the data from 2001 to 2016 which are almost blank therefore we collected monthly average temperature and precipitation data from the climate research unit cru time series ts 4 04 51 54 n 68 72 e 1901 2016 http climexp knmi nl the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and palmer drought severity index pdsi data from the nearest grid 51 54 n 68 72 e were obtained at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 1901 2016 previous studies have demonstrated the applicability and reliability of cru data in the burabai region akkemik et al 2020 mazarzhanova et al 2017 one streamflow dataset was obtained from the kostanai hydrologic station 53 11 n 63 37 e 1967 2016 170 m a s l which measures the upper and middle reaches of the tobol river the other streamflow dataset was collected from the petropavlovsk hydrologic station 54 49 n 69 09 e 1967 2016 142 m a s l which measures the middle and lower reaches of the ishim river during the measurement period the positions and types of the measuring instruments at the two hydrological stations did not change since both rivers are tributaries of the lower irtysh river and are relatively close to one another the streamflow of the two rivers was combined for further analyses studies have shown that the formation of tree rings is affected not only by hydrological climatic conditions that occur during the growth periods of trees but also by conditions that occur before the growing season barber et al 2000 cook et al 2000 consequently we analyzed different combinations of monthly hydrometeorological data 2 4 analytical method rf is an improved decision tree algorithm model breiman 2001 zhou et al 2020 the principle of the program algorithm is as follows input the sample data into d f 1 x f 2 x f i x where i represents the variables of the sample including rc1 rc2 and streamflow data randomly select m samples from the sample data to obtain the training data d t f m 1 x f m 2 x f mi x select j j i variables at random from the i variables the i variables include rc1 and rc2 the predictor variable is set to the streamflow data establish a decision tree select the best split point of the j variables assuming that the decision tree is represented as t t 1 t 2 t j the training set d t is used to train the decision tree the outputs represent the resulting data y t m 1 x t m 2 x t mj x in the training process each node of the decision tree is split into two daughter nodes the sampling and training processes are repeated until the user defined number of trees is reached in this paper the rf package of the python 3 scikit learn library was used for rf modeling https scikit learn org stable nelli 2018 the rf model has five important parameters specifically n estimators max depth min samples leaf min samples split and max features bisong 2019 the n estimators refers to the number of trees in the rf and is used to improve the predictive accuracy and control overfitting the max depth denotes the maximum depth of the decision tree the min samples leaf and min samples split represent the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node and the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node respectively the max features refers to the number of variables to consider paper 2020 after parameter tuning we set the n estimators to 204 max depth to 3 max features to 2 and min samples leaf and min samples split to 1 and 2 respectively multiple linear regression mlr and knn were also used to reconstruct the streamflow of the ishim tobol river and their results were compared to the rf model results knn is a simple and effective machine learning algorithm based on the nearest neighbor rule mlr is one of the traditional regression analysis methods the knn package of the python 3 scikit learn library was used for knn modeling https scikit learn org stable the parameter k in the knn model was set to 8 the final sequence used for analysis resulted from the ensemble reconstruction of the three models fig 5 shows the framework illustration of our research first a correlation analysis between the two regional residual chronologies and the streamflow data of the ishim tobol river from 1967 to 2016 was carried out the results showed that the two regional residual chronologies were significantly correlated with the cumulative streamflow of the ishim tobol river in june july p 0 01 which indicates that the two regional residual chronologies could be used to reconstruct streamflow second after a strict analysis and verification three reconstruction models were established by applying two regional residual chronologies as variables and the data recorded on the ishim tobol river as predictor variables the pearson correlation coefficient r explained variance r2 reduction in error re product means test pmt sign test st nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the three regression models and the low pass filter values were calculated to show the low frequency range variation of the reconstruction the spatial representation of the reconstruction was analyzed with a spatial correlation analysis and the multitaper mtm spectral analysis method therrell et al 2006 and a wavelet analysis torrence and compo 1998 were applied to assess the periodicity tendencies in the reconstruction furthermore the reconstruction was related to large scale atmospheric circulation patterns and we analyzed the 850 hpa vapor fluxes for 5 extreme drought events and 5 extreme flood events between 1950 and 2016 3 results 3 1 chronology and climate growth linkage the rc1 and rc2 chronologies were positively correlated with the monthly mean temperature from october to march but negatively correlated with the monthly mean temperature from april to july fig 6 the temperature in the study area began to rise in march and both the warm environment and melting snow had a positive effect on the growth of trees nevertheless a counter effect was observed from april to july extremely high temperatures in late spring and early summer caused trees to display narrow annual rings barnett et al 2005 jonas et al 2008 kopabayeva et al 2017 the precipitation from october of the previous year to july of the current year had a positive effect on the tree ring width and this effect was amplified in april and june p 0 05 the growth of trees in central asia is affected not only by climatic factors during the growing season but also by the precipitation and temperature conditions before the early period of the growing season jiang et al 2020 wang et al 2006 the study area experiences less precipitation in winter and spring which has no significant impact on the growth of trees the cumulative summer precipitation is 133 30 mm which accounts for 42 01 of the annual cumulative precipitation the increase in precipitation during this period improves the soil moisture content and compensates for the water deficiencies caused by high temperatures bell et al 2010 berg et al 2016 the high correlations among the spei pdsi and tree ring width index validate this concept the correlations between the tree ring width index and hydroclimatic factors were significant in june p 0 05 here a narrow ring is defined as a tree ring width index lower than the average minus the standard deviation in the same way a wide ring is defined as a tree ring width index higher than the average plus the standard deviation we counted the shared years in both the rc1 and rc2 chronologies with above average temperatures and below average precipitation in june from 1967 to 2016 and found probabilities of narrow tree rings of 86 67 and 80 0 respectively in contrast when temperatures were below average and precipitation was above average the probabilities of wide tree rings being measured were 72 73 and 63 64 respectively this phenomenon illustrates that the temperature and precipitation conditions in june significantly affect the growth of trees and the streamflow precipitation recharge is the direct source of streamflow in summer and indirectly affects the growth of trees through the soil moreover streamflow variations eliminate the independent influence of the local microclimate and can better reflect the overall situation of the analyzed basin wagesho et al 2012 yin et al 2008 we screened the rc1 and rc2 chronologies against streamflow for various seasonal combinations of monthly yields and found a maximum correlation from june to july p 0 01 when the optimal seasonal window was expanded the correlation showed a downward trend therefore the streamflow from june to july is the best quota of the predictor variable 3 2 streamflow reconstruction the reconstruction result of the rf model differed every time that the model was run as each decision tree was constructed by randomly drawing training samples from the original data yang et al 2016 it is possible that some samples are considered in decision tree training more than once and that some samples are not considered at all millard and richardson 2015 data anti jamming is an advantage of the rf model and the randomly selected sample data of each tree has no additional impact on the overall evaluation despite all of this the result of one reconstruction is still uncertain based on this information we reconstructed the rf model 10 000 times and the average sequence obtained through these 10 000 reconstructions was used as the final result to evaluate the effects of the rf knn and mlr models we compared the streamflow of the instrument during the observation period with the output values of the three models the mlr model is as follows y 64 12 r c 1 30 03 r c 2 37 31 where rc1 represents the rc1 regional residual chronology rc2 denotes the rc2 regional residual chronology and y signifies the average streamflow from june to july in the ishim tobol river fig 7 shows that during the calibration and verification periods the outputs of the three streamflow reconstruction models matched well with the observed data and the first order difference analyses demonstrated the same results table 2 lists the statistical characteristics of the rf knn and mlr models during the calibration and verification periods the rf models in fig 7 and table 2 are the average values after 10 000 operations we found that the correlation coefficient and explained variance were the highest for the rf model which indicates that the rf regression model was better than the other reconstruction models regarding the pmt and re values the three models all passed the significance tests in the sign test the rf and knn models showed better performance than the mlr model which confirms that the rf and knn models had better consistency in modeling low frequency variations as determined by analyzing the rmse and nse values of the three models the predictions of the rf model were closest to the observed values although the comprehensive performance of the rf model shows better reconstruction ability it may only be a marginal edge advantage accordingly to retain more reconstruction information and results we integrated the rf knn and mlr models for ensemble reconstruction this new sequence is obtained by the arithmetic average processing of three models and is used for subsequent analysis and discussion 3 3 streamflow characteristics of the ensemble reconstruction the ensemble reconstruction of the ishim tobol river streamflow provides important hydrological information for the northern region of kazakhstan fig 8 to investigate extremely high and low streamflow years in the reconstructed data we defined extremely high streamflow as reconstruction values above the mean σ and extremely low streamflow as reconstruction values below the mean σ gou et al 2010 this process resulted in a total of 37 extremely high streamflow years and 39 extremely low streamflow years in the ishim tobol river between 1788 and 2016 table 3 in addition the occurrence of a dry wet period was determined if the low pass filtered reconstruction values were continuously lower higher than the long term average for 10 years we found that dry periods occurred from 1831 to 1846 1863 1878 1892 1905 and 1950 1971 and wet periods were identified from 1792 to 1803 1821 1830 1847 1862 1920 1931 and 1985 1995 the mtm analysis detected several main periodicities in the reconstructed streamflow data 2 8 3 2 years and 2 year periodicities at the 0 05 significance level fig 9a the wavelet analysis results supported many of the findings of the mtm analysis fig 9b and indicated that the most significant periodicity in the streamflow reconstruction occurred at a period of 2 8 3 2 years in addition we used cru self calibrating pdsi grid data to analyze the spatial correlation between the observed and reconstructed streamflow data from 1967 to 2016 the results revealed a high spatial correlation between the reconstructed fig 9c and observed fig 9d pdsi grid data the regions with the highest correlation values are located in the middle and lower plains of the ishim tobol river basin 4 discussion 4 1 regional comparison two other reconstruction sequences were available as comparisons to study the temporal and spatial variabilities in large scale hydroclimatic conditions fig 10 one dataset was based on pdsi reconstruction selected grid cell 51 54 n 68 72 e spatial resolution 2 5 2 5 from tree rings in asia cook et al 2010 the other dataset comprised reconstructed precipitation in the burabai region from october of the previous year to july of the current year akkemik et al 2020 over the past two centuries the precipitation reconstruction from the burabai region r 0 41 n 200 p 0 01 and the pdsi reconstruction r 0 25 n 200 p 0 01 both showed high correlations with the ishim tobol river streamflow reconstruction obtained in this study the graphical comparisons displayed similar high low streamflow episodes in common periods under different reconstructions as illustrated in fig 10 the 1810 s 1830 1840 s 1870 s 1910 s 1950 s and 1960 s intervals represented episodes with notably low streamflow while the 1800 s 1820 s 1850 s and 1970 1980 s were identified as high streamflow episodes under all reconstructions over the past two centuries the period from 1831 to 1846 was indicated as a long drought duration in the reconstructions and a corresponding drought trend has also been reported in northern kyrgyzstan zhang et al 2020 it is suggested that the hydrological change in our study area is connected to the other region during this drought period the kazakh nationality had numerous uprisings against the domination of the tsar the most notable among them was the 1836 uprising which lasted the longest and corresponded to an extremely low streamflow in 1836 which suggests a possible link between drought and the development of civilization kasenov 2014 the great famine in kazakhstan 1931 1933 was caused by agricultural collectivization and the extended aridity corresponded to a drought period as identified by our reconstructions janmaat 2006 in addition the great famine of 1921 in the ural region corresponded to an extreme drought year in our reconstructions katzer 2005 interestingly the ishim tobol river streamflow has increased since 1970 and the regional climate appears to have shifted from warm and dry to warm and wet this variation reflects the connection with global warming chen et al 2016 zou et al 2021 4 2 streamflow and atmospheric general circulation the main periodic variations observed in the streamflow of the ishim tobol river were related to the north atlantic oscillation nao and quasi biennial oscillation qbo which indicates an association between atmospheric general circulation and streamflow in central asia bothe et al 2012 sauer et al 2021 we analyzed the correlation between the reconstructed ishim tobol river streamflow and the nao index cook et al 1998 and found a strong positive correlation r 0 40 n 193 p 0 01 fig 11a the wavelet analysis showed a significant correlation on the quasi 3 7 16 and 32 year scales during the common period from 1788 to 1980 fig 11b the arrows in fig 11b show the positive correlation identified from 1825 to 1890 however an inverse correlation was found during the 1950 s on an approximately 16 year time scale this variation was presumably due to interannual oscillations of the nao central asia is located in the region of influence of the subpolar westerlies and precipitation is mainly influenced by westerly circulation patterns in this region aizen et al 2001 wang et al 2020 central asia is also an essential corridor for the latitudinal transport of water vapor from the atlantic and arctic oceans which affects the intensity of water vapor entering china s arid areas from 1950 2016 we selected 5 extremely high streamflow years 1987 1990 1993 2007 and 2015 figs 11c and 5 extremely low streamflow years 1955 1968 1969 1998 and 2012 fig 11d to conduct a vapor flux analysis we found that during humid years warm and humid air currents from the north atlantic ocean and arctic ocean affected the study area which induced increased precipitation and streamflow while in dry years the north atlantic air current could not reach the inland area and the study area was thus significantly affected by continental air currents that often resulted in drought events this relationship is associated with the nao during the positive phase of the nao the subpolar westerlies are oriented northerly and are stronger and the zonal water vapor gradient increases which increases vapor flux transport in central asia and china s arid areas chen et al 2013 gerlitz et al 2016 in the negative nao phase water vapor and precipitation are reduced due to water flux divergence hu et al 2017 furthermore historical records indicate that drought events have occurred in northwest china during the negative phases of the nao lee and zhang 2011 li and zhang 2015 4 3 implications for water resource management at present the water resource issues within the ishim tobol river basin mainly include transboundary water resource management water pollution and water scarcities krasnoyarova et al 2019 ospanov et al 2020 yunussova and mosiej 2016 the basin is located in the northern part of kazakhstan in a concentrated population area with intensive agricultural and industrial production activities and severe water pollution problems alimbaev et al 2020 karatayev et al 2017 the primary pollutants in this region are heavy metals and organic matter introduced from anthropogenic sources these pollutants seriously threaten the utilization of surface water resources in the basin zinoviev et al 2020 to further analyze the supply of surface water resources in the basin we compared the reconstructed streamflow data of the ishim tobol river with instrumentally recorded data according to the streamflow reconstructions and the cumulative distribution function of the dry period streamflow data the probability that the streamflow did not correspond to the multiyear average over the last two centuries was 64 19 while the probability that the dry period streamflow did not correspond to the multiyear average was 82 99 fig 11e in addition we calculated that 63 76 of the years in the reconstructed period had values below the multiyear average which indicates that the basin is in a perennial water shortage situation and that anthropogenic water use has exceeded the threshold value limited by streamflow therefore the surface water demand in the basin will not be met for 7 out of 10 years if future changes in climate scenarios result in low streamflow periods notably solving the problems of pollution and water scarcity is critical for water resource management in the region if these issues continue to increase in parallel then the sustainable development of kazakhstan will be adversely affected instrumentally recorded streamflow periods are short and reconstructed streamflow changes can represent actual streamflow data to thus provide scientific information for water resource forecasting and the development of management policies 4 4 limitations and wider implications in this study the ensemble reconstruction of the three models indicated the course of the ishim tobor river streamflow over the past two centuries beyond this the comparative analysis of the three models reflects their performance in tree ring reconstruction in particular the rf algorithm has rarely been used in reconstruction work and it has a superior advantage in addressing nonlinear factor relationships li et al 2019a for example factors such as temperature precipitation and soil moisture could be incorporated into proxy indicators for reconstruction the application of the rf algorithm should be considered a suitable extension our study demonstrates the applicability and reliability of ensemble reconstruction from the rf algorithm knn algorithm and mlr in central asia which should not be limited to the current region this paper can provide a methodological reference for the study of hydrological variation in other areas and expand it to watershed studies in coastal plains or inland plateaus the process of basin hydrology variation is a complex and nonlinear process feng et al 2020 ouali et al 2016 factors such as the number of populations irrigated land urban area and water conservancy facilities affects the hydrological variability in the basin fig 12 the ishim tobor river is dominated by snowmelt as a source of recharge which limits our ability to explore rivers where alpine glacial meltwater or groundwater is the primary source of recharge nevertheless our study can provide a broader perspective for other regional river studies that can be applied in hydrological modeling the approach explored in this paper is limited to the utilization of tree ring indicators to reconstruct hydrologic variation future studies should focus on understanding the impact of human activities on watersheds and expanding the range of reconstructed indicators 5 conclusion the streamflow of the ishim tobol river from 1788 to 2016 in the kazakh uplands was reconstructed using tree ring data and verifies that the radial growth of trees in the studied basin is dominated by precipitation and temperature by comparing the utilized rf model with the knn and mlr models the rf model was found to perform better when reconstructing streamflow but this may only be the manifestation of superior edges to include more information and results in the sequence the three models were integrated for ensemble reconstruction between 1788 and 2016 the ishim tobol river experienced five high streamflow periods and four low streamflow periods we identified several cycles with periods of 2 8 3 2 and 2 years in the ensemble reconstruction the 1836 uprising and the great famines of 1921 and 1931 1933 were documented in the reconstructed data obtained in this study which shows a connection with civilization the wavelet analysis and correlation revealed that the nao is a possible natural forcing factor that influences the variation in the ishim tobol river streamflow the vapor flux analysis indicated that the study area is mainly influenced by warm and humid airflow from the arctic and atlantic oceans in high streamflow years while in low streamflow years the study area is influenced by continental airflows by comparing it with other reconstructions we further verify the reliability and authenticity of the ensemble reconstruction our study demonstrates the applicability to central asia of tree ring reconstruction using machine learning algorithms such ensemble reconstructions should be extended to other regions and the reconstruction metrics should not be limited to a single variable the factors that affect hydrological variability within a watershed include forces such as natural forcing and human

8016,study region han river mainstream china study focus human activities and climate change are synergistically impacting on the spatiotemporal features of han river surface water which affects the ecological environment evolution and economic development of the basin however the long term changes of the area and spatial characteristics of han river surface water have not been well quantified for lack of sufficient data and data processing powers the study produced the annual surface water products of han river mainstream from 1986 to 2020 based on google earth engine and landsat images and then analyzed the long term spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water and the influence of climatic factor and water conservancy projects construction new hydrological insights for the region during the past 35 years the surface water area of han river mainstream has shown a fluctuating upward trend overall and the dynamic changes have obvious regional and phased differences precipitation is the main climatic factor affecting the surface water area changes with precipitation changes and the implementation of water conservancy projects in han river the surface water area has increased significantly and many reaches have gradually widened in upstream while the surface water area has slowly decreased and many reaches have gradually narrowed in mid downstream the latest information about the spatiotemporal dynamics of han river surface water provided by the research can be used for the optimal allocation and management of the river s water resources keywords han river mainstream surface water area long term monitoring google earth engine influencing factors 1 introduction surface water is an important indicator of water resources including lakes reservoirs rivers streams ponds and etc and plays an important role in climate regulation biogeochemical cycles and surface energy balance carroll et al 2016 deng et al 2019 wang et al 2018 the decrease and increase of surface water are closely related to the local sustainable development and monitoring its dynamics is important for the health of natural environment and sustainable economic development jiang et al 2021b the han river is located in the middle eastern of china which is an important surface water resource and ecological protection barrier and it s also the water source of large scale inter basin water diversion projects such as the middle route of south to north water diversion project msnwd and the han to wei river water diversion project hu et al 2020 tan et al 2018 yan et al 2020 han river plays an irreplaceable role in the ecological environment balance and economic development of the basin and relevant regions in recent years han river is sustaining combined effects from complex climate change and human activities wang et al 2019 of which surface water area and spatial characteristics have changed to a certain extent and then affecting the regional water cycle and environmental stability therefore long term monitoring for han river surface water and analysis of its spatiotemporal variation characteristics with influencing factors are helpful to support the water resources management and ecological protection in the basin furthermore could promote the water ecological balance and economic development of han river basin however for a long time it is a huge challenge to monitor dynamic changes of surface water in a long time series with large scope as data acquisition and processing are difficult that require a large amount of manpower storage and computing resources the rapid technological progress in remote sensing big data and cloud computing has made large scale and long term surface water monitoring to be executable huang et al 2021 compared with traditional measurement methods remote sensing can provide real time dynamic and low cost water image information li et al 2019 optical remote sensing satellite sensors usually have the characteristics as high spectral and spatial resolutions wide coverage and short revisit period li et al 2020a among all remote sensing satellites landsat series is a medium spatial resolution satellite with rich archive data and the longest observation time span which is a valuable resource for monitoring global changes chander et al 2009 hansen and loveland 2012 usually a large amount of remote sensing data needs to be processed for a long term surface water monitoring while traditional remote sensing image processing platforms such as envi need to download the images locally firstly and then process them one by one which is time consuming and laborious li et al 2020b google earth engine gee cloud computing platform integrates a large number of remote sensing datasets that contain landsat with super capabilities on computing analysis and visualization and has unique advantages in processing and analyzing mass of image data gorelick et al 2017 users can use the data provided by the platform for free or upload their own data and process and analyze a large amount of image data in a very high speed with the help of millions of servers around the world and the most advanced cloud computing and storage capabilities chen et al 2017 dong et al 2016 zurqani et al 2018 therefore remote sensing monitoring based on gee has been an effective means for analyzing the large scale and long term surface water dynamic changes for example pekel et al 2016 quantified the dynamic changes of global surface water from 1984 to 2015 by gee and landsat images based on gee and 89 000 landsat images huang et al 2021 comprehensively evaluated the dynamic characteristics of open surface water and driving factors in the irtysh river basin over the past 30 years deng et al 2019 and wang et al 2018 also used the data and computing advantages of gee to analyze the temporal changes of surface water and influencing factors in the yangtze river basin at present it is lack of relevant studies on monitoring the long time series dynamic changes of surface water in the whole han river by remote sensing methods based on landsat images and related methods zhang et al 2020b monitored the spatial morphology evolution of channel bars in the han river midstream from 1986 to 2018 wang et al 2019 extracted and analyzed the spatiotemporal changes of water level fluctuation zone and water area in the han river mid downstream from 1987 to 2017 however these researches have not been extended to the entire river while other studies on han river surface water mainly focus on evaluating the water resources allocation and management and the impact of water conservancy projects on surface water deng et al 2021 kuo et al 2019 tian et al 2021 2019 wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 zhou et al 2017 surface water dynamics is an important characteristic of the river so it is necessary urgent and valuable to explore the spatiotemporal changes of the han river surface water this study used gee platform and landsat images to monitor the surface water dynamics in han river mainstream that produced an annual surface water dataset for more than 30 years analyzed the temporal and spatial variation trends and characteristics of the surface water and explored the driving factors that affect the surface water changes finally a relatively complete information about the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of han river surface water was formed 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area in this paper is han river mainstream with a latitude and longitude range of 106 3 114 3 e and 30 3 33 7 n fig 1 the han river originates from ningqiang county in the southern foothills of the qinling mountains in shaanxi province which is the largest tributary of the yangtze river with a length of about 1577 km shen et al 2021 it flows through shaanxi and hubei provinces and joins the yangtze river in wuhan covering a basin area of about 159 000 km² han et al 2018 jiang et al 2021a yang et al 2016 from the source to danjiangkou dam is the upstream with a length of about 925 km and a narrow river valley from danjiangkou dam to huangzhuang hydrological station in zhongxiang is the midstream with a length of about 270 km and a wide river valley and many sandy beaches from huangzhuang hydrological station to hankou is the downstream with a length of about 382 km and the river is winding and gradually narrowing shen et al 2021 zhou et al 2017 the han river basin is characterized by high elevation in the northwest low elevation in the southeast and a large terrain drop with the highest elevation of about 3000 m and the average elevation of the lower plain area less than 50 m ran et al 2021 the area is located in the east asian subtropical monsoon zone which is affected by the eurasian cold high pressure in winter and the western pacific subtropical high pressure in summer so the climate is obviously seasonality deng et al 2021 tian et al 2020 the multi year average temperature in the basin is 12 16 and the annual precipitation shows an increasing trend from northwest to southeast fluctuating between 800 and 1300 mm tian et al 2021 the hydrological characteristics of han river mainstream have a certain spatial heterogeneity compared with the upstream the water level in the midstream and downstream is lower but the flow is larger which is consistent with the topography of the area the annual average water level of the river fluctuates relatively stable while the interannual fluctuation of the annual average flow is relatively large fluctuating between 500 and 1800 m³ s fig 5 a b although the han river is relatively abundance in water volume the subtropical monsoon climate and complex topography result in an extremely uneven distribution of annual precipitation in the area and the distribution of water resources has significant temporal and spatial diversity tian et al 2019 2 2 data 2 2 1 image data a total of 4983 raw scenes from the landsat level 1 terrain precision correction dataset usgs 2019 that cover the study area were used to extract surface water including three different sensors tm etm and oli corresponding to different time periods table 1 as stripe loss problems of etm images started to occur in 2003 miao et al 2019 tm images were chosen from 2003 to 2011 in addition we found that the dates of the chosen images each year are evenly distributed in all months fig 2 rather than concentrated in certain months sentinel 2 images with spatial resolution of 10 m were used to evaluate the accuracy of surface water extraction a total of 89 sentinel 2 level 1 c scenes table s1 that cover the verification area and have the same or similar dates as the chosen landsat images were selected these images could be obtained directly from gee 2 2 2 jrc global surface water the jrc global surface water monthly water history v1 3 dataset gee 2021b is provided by the european commission s joint research centre and contains maps of the location and temporal distribution of surface water from 1984 to 2020 this dataset was generated using 4453 989 scenes from landsat 5 7 and 8 acquired between 16 march 1984 and 31 december 2020 holding the entire history of water detection on a month by month basis we use the annual water body products of han river mainstream synthesized from the jrc monthly historical data to indirectly evaluate the extraction accuracy of our annual surface water dataset 2 2 3 meteorological and hydrological data the daily dataset of china s surface climate data provided by the china meteorological data network http data cma cn contains the latest daily climate data of 756 surface meteorological observation stations and automatic stations in china since 1951 we selected the precipitation temperature and other climate features measured by meteorological stations near the han river mainstream fig 1 in the dataset as independent variables affecting the surface water and then analyzed the correlation between climate factors and surface water area since the evapotranspiration data in this dataset has many missing conditions and cannot be used for analysis we used the potential evapotranspiration data in the terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 dataset as a substitute the annual average water level and flow data measured by 8 hydrological stations fig 1 on the han river mainstream from 1986 to 2020 are provided by the changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources we explored the hydrological characteristics of the han river and the long term variation characteristics in water level and flow with the change of surface water area 2 3 method 2 3 1 annual surface water dataset production and accuracy verification in this study the production process of long term surface water products in han river mainstream lsw hrm includes three parts image pretreatment water extraction and verification and post processing fig 3 in the image pretreatment stage we use the simple composite method gee 2021a provided in gee to generate a full coverage composite image with the least cloudiness and the best quality each year the approach applies standard top of atmosphere toa calibration to compute landsat toa composite from a collection of raw landsat scenes which assigns a cloud score to each pixel with the simple cloud score algorithm and selects the lowest possible range of cloud scores at each point deng et al 2020 in the water extraction and verification stage the modified normalized difference water index mndwi xu 2005 is used to extract surface water of han river mainstream as the method can adapt to diverse land surface terrains the formula is as follows 1 mndwi p green p mir p green p mir where p green and p mir are the bands green and mid infrared corresponding to bands 2 and 5 in landsat tm and etm and bands 3 and 6 in landsat oli respectively through relevant experiments we determine the empirical threshold suitable for the surface water extraction in han river which can accurately separate water pixels from non water pixels and obtain the preliminary water body products the confusion matrix is used to verify the water detection accuracy which is widely used to evaluate the accuracy of remote sensing classification compared to the real ground information including kappa coefficient overall accuracy oa user s accuracy producer s accuracy and other evaluation indicators foody 2002 yue et al 2020 the han river mainstream covers a large spatial range so we select three test areas fig s1 located respectively in the upstream midstream and downstream for accuracy verification 10 000 verification points are randomly generated in the extracted water vector and its buffer zone of the test areas including 5000 water points and 5000 non water points of which 2000 verification points including 1000 water points and 1000 non water points are selected each year from 2016 to 2020 then the visual interpretation results from sentinel 2 images with the same or similar dates are used to calculate the confusion matrix as shown in table 2 the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient are 95 05 and 0 901 indicating that the lsw hrm dataset extracted based on landsat images in this study has high accuracy and can be a reliable research data source finally in order to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the subsequent analysis a more detailed visual inspection is carried out on the preliminary water body products and obvious error detection parts such as buildings clouds and mountain shadows are removed we compare the surface water after visual inspection with jrc annual synthetic products fig 4 the han river water bodies in annual jrc synthetic products before 2000 are incomplete it can be seen that the water area of lsw hrm and jrc products are relatively close and the variation trend is basically the same indicating that the surface water products extracted in this study have certain accuracy due to the satellite s revisit feature in many cases the landsat images cannot cover the entire han river in the time scale of one month and there is also a certain cloud cover at the same time therefore many of the han river surface water in jrc monthly dataset is incomplete in addition in many areas there is no surface water data in this dataset in december each year this may be due to the influence of ice and snow cover therefore the annual surface water synthesized by the dataset have a certain degree of uncertainty however in this paper the special image mosaic method provided by gee is used to process all the images each year which can obtain full coverage and almost cloud free synthetic images and the annual surface water data produced is relatively complete therefore in fig 4 the water area value of lsw hrm is slightly larger than that of jrc products 2 3 2 trend analysis and significance test in this paper sen slope sen 1968 is used to analyze the time series trends of univariate and mann kendall kendall 1975 mann 1945 is used for significance tests the univariate in this study is surface water area and various climatic factors sen slope has the advantage of being insensitive to outliers and has been widely used to detect the temporal trend of hydrological and meteorological data chauluka et al 2021 gocic and trajkovic 2013 winslow et al 2015 yang et al 2020a 2020b the mann kendall is a typical non parametric method recommended by the world meteorological organization and is widely used in the trend significance test of river flux precipitation and temperature data hamed 2009 yue et al 2002 2 3 3 correlation analysis the pearson correlation coefficient is used to evaluate the correlation between surface water area and climate factors in han river mainstream the formula is as follows osmani et al 2019 2 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 y i y 2 where r is the correlation coefficient x i and y i are two parameters participating in the correlation analysis and are the average value of these two parameters and n is the parameter sample size r 0 or r 0 indicates that there is a positive or negative correlation between the two parameters at the confidence level and the greater the absolute value of r the stronger the correlation ali et al 2019 neto et al 2011 zhang et al 2020a in addition p is used to accurately describe the confidence level p 0 05 or p 0 01 means reaching the 95 or 99 confidence level while p 0 05 means that the correlation between the two parameters cannot be compared 3 results 3 1 temporal variation trends and characteristics of surface water area from 1986 2020 the surface water area of han river mainstream showed an overall increasing trend fig 5 which did not reach the 95 confidence level p 0 109 0 05 with figs 5 and 6 it can be seen that the interannual changes of surface water area have obvious fluctuation showing the characteristics of alternating increase and decrease and the increase and decrease times of area are the same table s3 we performed a conjugate analysis of the changes in surface water area annual average water level and flow of the han river mainstream and annual precipitation in the region near the mainstream fig 5 a b c it can be seen that for more than 30 years the annual average water level of han river and the annual precipitation in the region have shown a slow increasing trend both the overall trend and the interannual change process are very consistent with the surface water area although the annual average flow shows a slow decreasing trend overall its dynamic change process is basically in line with the surface water area these indicate that our water body extraction results are consistent with the measured hydrological data and have high accuracy and the changes in surface water area are closely related to the local precipitation at the same time we find that the temporal variation of surface water presents different phased trends and characteristics during the period of 1986 1995 the interannual fluctuation of surface water area was relatively small and the water area increased first and then decreased with an overall decreasing trend the same is true for the changes of the annual average water level and flow and annual precipitation in the corresponding period from 1996 2010 the interannual fluctuation of surface water area was dramatic showing the variation characteristic of alternating droughts and floods meanwhile the interannual variation of river water level and flow during this period was also relatively large the water area showed an overall increasing trend and the maximum minimum and multiple peak values all appeared in this period most of the water areas in adjacent years have undergone abrupt changes which may be related to the same severe interannual fluctuation of precipitation in this period fig 5 c for example in 1998 and 2010 severe floods occurred in most areas of the yangtze river mid downstream due to continuous rainstorms so the corresponding surface water area of han river suddenly reached its peak from 2011 2020 the surface water area firstly decreased and then increased with an overall trend of increase and the interannual dynamic fluctuation gradually tended to be stable the change process of surface water area during this period was basically the same as the corresponding water level flow and precipitation during the 35 year period the surface water area of han river mainstream fluctuated in the interval of 950 1350 km² table s2 with an average of 1143 28 km² the smallest and largest area were in 1999 955 8 km² and 2010 1324 8 km² although the interannual variation of water area is obvious the increase of water body is more than the decrease on the whole which makes the total surface water area increase by 248 6 km² over the past 35 years in a word the overall trend of surface water area during the past 35 years is wave like uplift there are certain differences and similarities in surface water area changes in different reaches fig 7 during the 35 year period the upstream surface water area showed a significant increasing trend and achieved the 99 confidence level p 0 000 0 01 while that in the midstream and downstream showed a slow decreasing trend and did not reach the 95 confidence level p 0 177 and 0 580 respectively the surface water area changes in three reaches all show certain fluctuations and the dynamic change processes are basically consistent with the whole mainstream that is they can also be divided into three stages with different characteristics in the upstream the surface water area fluctuated relatively small during 1986 1995 and the area increased first and then decreased with an overall increasing trend from 1996 2010 the interannual fluctuation of water area was relatively drastic the maximum area appeared in this period and the water area showed an overall increasing trend from 2011 2020 the dynamic changes of surface water area gradually tended to be stable and the area decreased first and then increased with an overall increasing trend in the midstream the surface water area fluctuated relatively small during 1986 1995 and the water area increased first and then decreased with an overall decreasing trend during 1996 2010 the interannual fluctuation of surface water area was relatively large the maximum and minimum areas appeared in this period and the water area showed an overall decreasing trend from 2011 2020 the surface water area showed a decreasing trend and the interannual fluctuation gradually tended to be stable in the downstream the surface water area fluctuated relatively little during 1986 1995 and the water area increased first and then decreased with an overall decreasing trend during the period of 1996 2010 the interannual fluctuation of surface water area was large the maximum area appeared in this period and the water area showed an overall increasing trend from 2011 2020 the interannual fluctuation of surface water area gradually tended to be stable and showed an overall increasing trend 3 2 spatial variation trends and characteristics of surface water with the area variation the surface water of han river mainstream also changes in spatial we choose some reaches with obvious changes for analyze for more than 30 years many reaches have experienced a process of first widening and then narrowing and their river width is pinching down overall in the mid downstream of han river fig 8 which is consistent with the decreasing trend of surface water area and from the comparison between 2020 and 2010 it can be seen that the narrowing of the width of these reaches has become more obvious in the past decade the shrinkage of surface water has weakened the river erosion and impact capacities of many reaches in mid downstream however many reaches have experienced a process of first narrowing and then widening and their river width has widened overall in the upstream fig 9 which is consistent with the increasing trend of surface water area the comparison between 2020 and 2010 shows that the surface water near the danjiangkou reservoir fig 9 a b has expanded more significantly during the past decade and the river widening trend is obvious the change of surface water area in han river mainstream has obvious interannual fluctuation which may indicate that the water bodies often expand and contract in spatial we make spatial overlay analysis on the surface water vectors and obtain the distribution of water bodies that have expanded and contracted and the occurrence frequency during the 35 year period fig s2 s3 the higher the frequency value the more frequently the water bodies have expanded or contracted in spatial over the past 35 years we find that the distribution of water bodies that have undergone spatial expansion and contraction is consistent that is the water areas that are easy to expand are also prone to shrink which is in line with the general spatial variation characteristics of surface water water bodies that are prone to expand and contract in spatial can be regarded as dynamic water fig 10 which mainly concentrates in the reaches between the cuijiaying water conservancy project and xinglong water conservancy project in the mid downstream and the reaches near the danjiangkou reservoir in the upstream the surface water in these areas is extremely sensitive and has frequent spatial dynamic changes so it is necessary to focus on preventing floods and droughts during the river s wet and dry seasons conversely water bodies that rarely expand and shrink can be regarded as stable water 3 3 influence of climate factors on the surface water of han river mainstream the temporal and spatial changes of the surface water in han river mainstream are the result of multiple factors of these climate change plays an important driving role in order to quantify the influence of climate change on han river surface water we use climate data such as precipitation humidity and temperature as independent variables that may affect the water area and then analyze the correlation between climate factors and surface water area the climatic differences between different reaches are obvious due to the large spatial span of the river in order to obtain more accurate analysis results taking into account the significant topographical climatic and land cover variability of the areas through which han river flows we make correlation analysis in the upstream midstream and downstream respectively we collect a total of 8 climate factors including the average surface temperature precipitation average air pressure average relative humidity sunshine hours average temperature and average wind speed from the daily dataset of china s surface climate data as well as the potential evapotranspiration from terraclimate we first use spss to conduct principal component analysis on climate factors the correlation analysis results of climate factors in the upstream midstream and downstream are similar table s4 s5 s6 and we find that there is a strong positive correlation between the average surface temperature and the average temperature so only one of them needs to be analyzed there are also certain correlations between some other climate factors but correlations are not so strong therefore we finally select 7 climate factors except the average surface temperature to conduct correlation analysis with surface water area in fact each climate factor has their own variation trends and characteristics fig s4 and their correlations with the surface water area of han river mainstream are also different fig 11 the precipitation in the upstream shows an overall increasing trend but that is not obvious in the midstream and the precipitation in the downstream generally shows a slow decreasing trend data show that precipitation gradually increases from upstream to midstream to downstream with large interannual fluctuations it can be seen that there is a strong positive correlation between surface water area and precipitation in the upstream r 0 732 reaching the confidence level of 99 p 0 000 and there is a moderate positive correlation between surface water area and precipitation in the midstream and downstream r 0 413 and 0 400 both reaching the 95 confidence level p 0 014 and 0 017 therefore we believe that the change of precipitation has a great influence on the surface water area especially in the han river upstream in general the more rainfall the larger the surface water area of the river the average relative humidity in the upstream fluctuates greatly and shows a weak trend of increase while that in the midstream and downstream shows a significant decreasing trend and the average relative humidity gradually increases from the upstream to midstream to downstream there is a weak positive correlation between surface water area and average relative humidity in the upstream and midstream r 0 394 and 0 377 respectively both reaching the confidence level of 95 p 0 019 and 0 026 respectively while there is no correlation between surface water and average relative humidity in the downstream it can be estimated that the change in average relative humidity affects the surface water area of han river to a certain extent this may be because in most cases the higher the humidity the less evaporation of river surface water and the humid air indirectly indicates that the rainfall is relatively sufficient which will increase the surface water area the average temperature in the upstream midstream and downstream all shows a significant upward trend over the past 35 years the interannual changes of temperature in different reaches are highly consistent with each other and with the decrease of altitude and latitude the average temperature gradually increases from upstream to midstream to downstream we find that there is no correlation between surface water area and average temperature in the upstream and downstream and a moderate negative correlation exists between surface water area and average temperature in the midstream r 0 443 which exceeds the 99 confidence level p 0 008 it can be concluded that temperature changes have little effect on the surface water area of han river mainstream the sunshine hours in the upstream midstream and downstream all show a downward trend and the decreasing trend in the midstream is relatively significant there is a moderate negative correlation between surface water area and sunshine hours in the upstream r 0 423 reaching the 95 confidence level p 0 011 while there is no correlation between surface water and sunshine hours in the midstream and downstream therefore the changes of sunshine hours have little influence on the surface water area of han river the average wind speed in the upstream midstream and downstream all shows an increasing trend and the increasing trend of upstream is more obvious there is a weak positive correlation between average wind speed and surface water area in the upstream r 0 337 reaching the 95 confidence level p 0 048 while there is no correlation between them in the midstream and downstream therefore it can be concluded that the changes of average wind speed have very little influence on the surface water area of han river mainstream the average air pressure in the upstream shows an overall slow rising trend while in the mid downstream it shows a significant decreasing trend at the same time no correlation between the surface water area and the average air pressure has been found in all reaches therefore changes of average air pressure have almost no effect on the surface water area the changes of potential evapotranspiration in the upstream midstream and downstream all show an increasing trend of which the upstream and midstream have a more significant increasing trend the interannual variation of the potential evapotranspiration in different reaches has certain similarities and with the decrease of altitude and latitude the potential evapotranspiration has a small increase from upstream to midstream to downstream we find that there is a negative correlation between the surface water area and potential evapotranspiration in the upstream midstream and downstream of han river of which there is a moderately negative correlation in the midstream but the correlation in the upstream and downstream does not reach the 95 confidence level correlation analysis results show that precipitation is the main climate factor affecting the changes of surface water area in the han river mainstream and it is also one of the important water sources of the river precipitation changes have a greater driving effect on the surface water area dynamics of the han river especially in the upstream changes in average relative humidity evapotranspiration average temperature and sunshine hours indirectly affect the surface water area of han river but the effect is limited the changes of average wind speed and average air pressure have almost no effect on the surface water area of han river 4 discussion 4 1 exploration of the influence of water conservancy projects on han river surface water since last century in order to effectively use the surface water resources of han river and promote the economic development of the basin the danjiangkou ankang wangfuzhou cuijiaying and xinglong water conservancy projects were constructed in 1974 1992 2001 2009 and 2012 danjiangkou reservoir is the second largest reservoir in china and began to store water in 1973 and it s also the water source of the msnwd lin et al 2021 xin et al 2015 according to statistics the total storage capacity of the first phase of danjiangkou reservoir was 17 45 billion m³ which increased to 29 05 billion m³ after the dam was heightened in 2010 liu et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 wangfuzhou cuijiaying and xinglong are large cascade reservoirs constructed in the han river mid downstream in the 21st century we believe that the construction of water conservancy projects is an important driving factor affecting the overall and local surface water area and spatial morphology changes of han river mainstream the implementation of these water conservancy projects has promoted and accelerated the trend of a significant increase in surface water area of the han river upstream and a slow decrease of the mid downstream over the past 35 years especially with the completion of the cuijiaying water conservancy project and the danjiangkou dam heightening project as an important part of msnwd the surface water area of both upstream midstream and downstream decreased simultaneously after 2010 and then the upstream surface water area increased much more significantly fig 7 and accompanied by changes in the spatial morphology of surface water in many reaches the surface water expanded more obviously and the river width increased significantly in many upstream reaches fig 9 a b while the water bodies shrank more obviously and the river width decreased significantly in many mid downstream reaches fig 8 a b fortunately with the completion of a series of compensation projects such as the yangtze han water diversion project kuo et al 2019 yang et al 2012 and xinglong water conservancy project the surface water area in the mid downstream has recovered and tended to be stable the construction of water conservancy projects also significantly changed the area and spatial form of surface water in nearby reaches figs 12 14 after the completion of these projects the surface water area near their upstream has increased significantly while that near their downstream has decreased generally for example after the danjiangkou dam was heightened the surface water area of the river near its upstream showed a significant increase while the water area near its downstream gradually decreased at the same time the heightening of the dam is also a sudden change point of significant changes in the water level and flow of nearby reaches fig s5 the water level of the river near its upstream increased sharply after a small decrease and the water level near its downstream decreased significantly and the dynamic changes are relatively drastic the same is true for the river flow of reaches near the dam the river flow near its upstream significantly decreased and then rebounded obviously and the river flow near its downstream plummeted from 2010 to 2014 and gradually stabilized in addition there is generally more sensitive and dynamic water near water conservancy projects than in other areas fig 10 which may also be the result of their effects building water conservancy projects is an effective way to control and manage water resources at present the scale and quantity of water conservancy projects in china rank among the top in the world the construction of water conservancy projects will change the morphology and natural hydrological conditions of the river to some extent and even reduce the biological community diversity and affect the river ecosystem health dong 2003 shen et al 2015 the construction of danjiangkou and other water conservancy projects has significantly changed the overall and local surface water spatial form and area of han river mainstream the shrinkage of surface water has weakened the river erosion capacity in many reaches of the mid downstream moreover the spatial form of the surface water in nearby reaches of water conservancy projects has undergone abrupt changes which would definitely cause negative impacts on residents and ecological environment around the river for more than 30 years although the water level of han river mainstream has been increasing overall its river flow has gradually decreased especially after the danjiangkou dam was heightened fig 5 a b relevant studies show that the heightening of the danjiangkou dam and the water delivery of the msnwd have reduced the water quality in the mid downstream of han river and even increased the occurrence probability of harmful algal blooms shen et al 2021 xin et al 2020 yang et al 2012 however as a whole surface water area of the entire han river mainstream has been slowly increasing over the past 35 years compensation projects such as yangtze han water diversion project and xinglong water conservancy project have made the surface water area of han river increase more obviously after a significant decrease meanwhile under the joint regulation of several water conservancy projects the dynamic changes of surface water area have stabilized in recent years seen from various reaches the surface water in the upstream midstream and downstream did not show extremely abnormal mutations during the 35 year period although the water area in the mid downstream is gradually decreasing overall the trend is slow and insignificant and the dynamic changes of surface water area in different reaches have also tended to be stable in recent years importantly water conservancy projects could not only help prevent flood disasters but also promote the rational management and distribution of water resources the heightening of danjiangkou dam has further improved the flood control capacity of the reservoir raising the flood control standard of the mid downstream from once every 20 years to 100 years fu et al 2015 and alleviated the flood control pressure in han river mid downstream and the hankou section of yangtze river the msnwd has alleviated the severe shortage of water resources in north china improved the ecological environment and investment environment in the water receiving areas of henan hebei beijing and tianjin and promoted the economic and social development of north china xu et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 2021 therefore we believe that although the construction of water conservancy projects has caused a relatively large negative impact on the han river surface water and ecological environment in a short term it has far reaching significance for the long term utilization of water resources flood control etc 4 2 enlightenment from dynamic characteristics of surface water in han river as one part of yangtze river economic belt han river is an important surface water resource in central china and the water source of the msnwd and plays an irreplaceable role in the development of local agriculture and industry lu et al 2018 yang et al 2021 according to the research we find that the spatiotemporal changes of the han river surface water in different reaches and different time periods are not same that is there are significant regional and phased differences which are the result of the combined effects of multiple driving factors such as complex climate change human activities and so on therefore when managing and utilizing surface water resources of han river the regional and phased differences in surface water dynamics should be fully considered and the influence of various factors should be integrated to formulate reasonable water resources management and planning schemes in addition to precipitation the main natural climate factor the spatiotemporal variation of han river surface water is also affected by the man made factor of building water conservancy projects to a large extent therefore on the one hand relevant departments must pay special attention to the sudden change of precipitation in han river basin and formulate corresponding measures in advance to deal with possible drought and flood disasters on the other hand although the construction of water conservancy projects has caused adverse effects on han river surface water and the surrounding environment in the short term it plays an important role in flood control power generation irrigation and promoting the rational distribution of water resources that is the construction of water conservancy projects has both advantages and disadvantages under the constraints of scientific policies and reasonable management and planning its positive role is much more than its disadvantages 4 3 uncertainty limitations and challenges the surface water products of han river mainstream extracted through gee and landsat images in this paper have high accuracy and consistency in accuracy verification and comparative analysis with other data but at the same time there are some uncertain aspects for example due to the limited time range of sentinel 2 images the water body extraction results before 2016 cannot be verified by visual interpretation in addition certain errors and uncertainties may occur when visually inspecting the results of surface water extraction this study did not analyze the long term variation of han river surface water in seasonal monthly and even individual dates which may omit some obvious seasonal dynamics and short term surface water events this is due to the long revisit period of the landsat satellite and the large spatial scope of the study area the image data with full coverage and low cloud cover cannot be obtained within a short time interval which is a general difficulty for the researches of both long term and large scope surface water dynamic monitoring based on only one kind of remote sensing data source like landsat images in future work sentinel gf series and other image source can be combined to study the seasonal variation characteristics of the han river surface water moreover the dynamic changes of han river surface water are the result of comprehensive action of various factors only some climatic factors and the man made factor of constructing water conservancy projects are analyzed in this article so next it may be possible to comprehensively analyze the impact of more factors such as geological structure ecological environment urbanization and land cover changes on the han river surface water 5 conclusions in this study we concentrate on the long term surface water changes in han river mainstream landsat images and gee are utilized as data source and process tool respectively to extract annual surface water products of han river mainstream in the past 35 years on this basis we analyzed the temporal and spatial dynamic characteristics of surface water and explored the impacts of climate change and water conservancy projects on han river surface water over the past 35 years the surface water area of han river mainstream has shown a fluctuating upward trend overall and the dynamic change process and overall trend are very consistent with the river water level and precipitation the dynamic changes of surface water have obvious regional and phased differences and have stabilized in recent years climate change and the role of water conservancy projects have significantly changed the area and spatial morphology of han river surface water with the change of precipitation and the implementation of water conservancy projects in han river the surface water area in upstream has shown a significant increasing trend while that in the midstream and downstream has decreased slowly meanwhile many reaches have an obvious expansion trend and their river width is increasing overall in the upstream while many reaches in the mid downstream have an obvious contraction trend their river width is decreasing overall and the river erosion capacity is weakening although the construction of water conservancy projects has caused a relatively large negative impact on han river surface water and ecological environment in a short term it has far reaching significance for the long term management and utilization of water resources and flood control this study revealed the long term temporal and spatial dynamic characteristics of surface water in han river mainstream which can provide scientific guidance for the evaluation and management of

8016,study region han river mainstream china study focus human activities and climate change are synergistically impacting on the spatiotemporal features of han river surface water which affects the ecological environment evolution and economic development of the basin however the long term changes of the area and spatial characteristics of han river surface water have not been well quantified for lack of sufficient data and data processing powers the study produced the annual surface water products of han river mainstream from 1986 to 2020 based on google earth engine and landsat images and then analyzed the long term spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water and the influence of climatic factor and water conservancy projects construction new hydrological insights for the region during the past 35 years the surface water area of han river mainstream has shown a fluctuating upward trend overall and the dynamic changes have obvious regional and phased differences precipitation is the main climatic factor affecting the surface water area changes with precipitation changes and the implementation of water conservancy projects in han river the surface water area has increased significantly and many reaches have gradually widened in upstream while the surface water area has slowly decreased and many reaches have gradually narrowed in mid downstream the latest information about the spatiotemporal dynamics of han river surface water provided by the research can be used for the optimal allocation and management of the river s water resources keywords han river mainstream surface water area long term monitoring google earth engine influencing factors 1 introduction surface water is an important indicator of water resources including lakes reservoirs rivers streams ponds and etc and plays an important role in climate regulation biogeochemical cycles and surface energy balance carroll et al 2016 deng et al 2019 wang et al 2018 the decrease and increase of surface water are closely related to the local sustainable development and monitoring its dynamics is important for the health of natural environment and sustainable economic development jiang et al 2021b the han river is located in the middle eastern of china which is an important surface water resource and ecological protection barrier and it s also the water source of large scale inter basin water diversion projects such as the middle route of south to north water diversion project msnwd and the han to wei river water diversion project hu et al 2020 tan et al 2018 yan et al 2020 han river plays an irreplaceable role in the ecological environment balance and economic development of the basin and relevant regions in recent years han river is sustaining combined effects from complex climate change and human activities wang et al 2019 of which surface water area and spatial characteristics have changed to a certain extent and then affecting the regional water cycle and environmental stability therefore long term monitoring for han river surface water and analysis of its spatiotemporal variation characteristics with influencing factors are helpful to support the water resources management and ecological protection in the basin furthermore could promote the water ecological balance and economic development of han river basin however for a long time it is a huge challenge to monitor dynamic changes of surface water in a long time series with large scope as data acquisition and processing are difficult that require a large amount of manpower storage and computing resources the rapid technological progress in remote sensing big data and cloud computing has made large scale and long term surface water monitoring to be executable huang et al 2021 compared with traditional measurement methods remote sensing can provide real time dynamic and low cost water image information li et al 2019 optical remote sensing satellite sensors usually have the characteristics as high spectral and spatial resolutions wide coverage and short revisit period li et al 2020a among all remote sensing satellites landsat series is a medium spatial resolution satellite with rich archive data and the longest observation time span which is a valuable resource for monitoring global changes chander et al 2009 hansen and loveland 2012 usually a large amount of remote sensing data needs to be processed for a long term surface water monitoring while traditional remote sensing image processing platforms such as envi need to download the images locally firstly and then process them one by one which is time consuming and laborious li et al 2020b google earth engine gee cloud computing platform integrates a large number of remote sensing datasets that contain landsat with super capabilities on computing analysis and visualization and has unique advantages in processing and analyzing mass of image data gorelick et al 2017 users can use the data provided by the platform for free or upload their own data and process and analyze a large amount of image data in a very high speed with the help of millions of servers around the world and the most advanced cloud computing and storage capabilities chen et al 2017 dong et al 2016 zurqani et al 2018 therefore remote sensing monitoring based on gee has been an effective means for analyzing the large scale and long term surface water dynamic changes for example pekel et al 2016 quantified the dynamic changes of global surface water from 1984 to 2015 by gee and landsat images based on gee and 89 000 landsat images huang et al 2021 comprehensively evaluated the dynamic characteristics of open surface water and driving factors in the irtysh river basin over the past 30 years deng et al 2019 and wang et al 2018 also used the data and computing advantages of gee to analyze the temporal changes of surface water and influencing factors in the yangtze river basin at present it is lack of relevant studies on monitoring the long time series dynamic changes of surface water in the whole han river by remote sensing methods based on landsat images and related methods zhang et al 2020b monitored the spatial morphology evolution of channel bars in the han river midstream from 1986 to 2018 wang et al 2019 extracted and analyzed the spatiotemporal changes of water level fluctuation zone and water area in the han river mid downstream from 1987 to 2017 however these researches have not been extended to the entire river while other studies on han river surface water mainly focus on evaluating the water resources allocation and management and the impact of water conservancy projects on surface water deng et al 2021 kuo et al 2019 tian et al 2021 2019 wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 zhou et al 2017 surface water dynamics is an important characteristic of the river so it is necessary urgent and valuable to explore the spatiotemporal changes of the han river surface water this study used gee platform and landsat images to monitor the surface water dynamics in han river mainstream that produced an annual surface water dataset for more than 30 years analyzed the temporal and spatial variation trends and characteristics of the surface water and explored the driving factors that affect the surface water changes finally a relatively complete information about the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of han river surface water was formed 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area in this paper is han river mainstream with a latitude and longitude range of 106 3 114 3 e and 30 3 33 7 n fig 1 the han river originates from ningqiang county in the southern foothills of the qinling mountains in shaanxi province which is the largest tributary of the yangtze river with a length of about 1577 km shen et al 2021 it flows through shaanxi and hubei provinces and joins the yangtze river in wuhan covering a basin area of about 159 000 km² han et al 2018 jiang et al 2021a yang et al 2016 from the source to danjiangkou dam is the upstream with a length of about 925 km and a narrow river valley from danjiangkou dam to huangzhuang hydrological station in zhongxiang is the midstream with a length of about 270 km and a wide river valley and many sandy beaches from huangzhuang hydrological station to hankou is the downstream with a length of about 382 km and the river is winding and gradually narrowing shen et al 2021 zhou et al 2017 the han river basin is characterized by high elevation in the northwest low elevation in the southeast and a large terrain drop with the highest elevation of about 3000 m and the average elevation of the lower plain area less than 50 m ran et al 2021 the area is located in the east asian subtropical monsoon zone which is affected by the eurasian cold high pressure in winter and the western pacific subtropical high pressure in summer so the climate is obviously seasonality deng et al 2021 tian et al 2020 the multi year average temperature in the basin is 12 16 and the annual precipitation shows an increasing trend from northwest to southeast fluctuating between 800 and 1300 mm tian et al 2021 the hydrological characteristics of han river mainstream have a certain spatial heterogeneity compared with the upstream the water level in the midstream and downstream is lower but the flow is larger which is consistent with the topography of the area the annual average water level of the river fluctuates relatively stable while the interannual fluctuation of the annual average flow is relatively large fluctuating between 500 and 1800 m³ s fig 5 a b although the han river is relatively abundance in water volume the subtropical monsoon climate and complex topography result in an extremely uneven distribution of annual precipitation in the area and the distribution of water resources has significant temporal and spatial diversity tian et al 2019 2 2 data 2 2 1 image data a total of 4983 raw scenes from the landsat level 1 terrain precision correction dataset usgs 2019 that cover the study area were used to extract surface water including three different sensors tm etm and oli corresponding to different time periods table 1 as stripe loss problems of etm images started to occur in 2003 miao et al 2019 tm images were chosen from 2003 to 2011 in addition we found that the dates of the chosen images each year are evenly distributed in all months fig 2 rather than concentrated in certain months sentinel 2 images with spatial resolution of 10 m were used to evaluate the accuracy of surface water extraction a total of 89 sentinel 2 level 1 c scenes table s1 that cover the verification area and have the same or similar dates as the chosen landsat images were selected these images could be obtained directly from gee 2 2 2 jrc global surface water the jrc global surface water monthly water history v1 3 dataset gee 2021b is provided by the european commission s joint research centre and contains maps of the location and temporal distribution of surface water from 1984 to 2020 this dataset was generated using 4453 989 scenes from landsat 5 7 and 8 acquired between 16 march 1984 and 31 december 2020 holding the entire history of water detection on a month by month basis we use the annual water body products of han river mainstream synthesized from the jrc monthly historical data to indirectly evaluate the extraction accuracy of our annual surface water dataset 2 2 3 meteorological and hydrological data the daily dataset of china s surface climate data provided by the china meteorological data network http data cma cn contains the latest daily climate data of 756 surface meteorological observation stations and automatic stations in china since 1951 we selected the precipitation temperature and other climate features measured by meteorological stations near the han river mainstream fig 1 in the dataset as independent variables affecting the surface water and then analyzed the correlation between climate factors and surface water area since the evapotranspiration data in this dataset has many missing conditions and cannot be used for analysis we used the potential evapotranspiration data in the terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 dataset as a substitute the annual average water level and flow data measured by 8 hydrological stations fig 1 on the han river mainstream from 1986 to 2020 are provided by the changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources we explored the hydrological characteristics of the han river and the long term variation characteristics in water level and flow with the change of surface water area 2 3 method 2 3 1 annual surface water dataset production and accuracy verification in this study the production process of long term surface water products in han river mainstream lsw hrm includes three parts image pretreatment water extraction and verification and post processing fig 3 in the image pretreatment stage we use the simple composite method gee 2021a provided in gee to generate a full coverage composite image with the least cloudiness and the best quality each year the approach applies standard top of atmosphere toa calibration to compute landsat toa composite from a collection of raw landsat scenes which assigns a cloud score to each pixel with the simple cloud score algorithm and selects the lowest possible range of cloud scores at each point deng et al 2020 in the water extraction and verification stage the modified normalized difference water index mndwi xu 2005 is used to extract surface water of han river mainstream as the method can adapt to diverse land surface terrains the formula is as follows 1 mndwi p green p mir p green p mir where p green and p mir are the bands green and mid infrared corresponding to bands 2 and 5 in landsat tm and etm and bands 3 and 6 in landsat oli respectively through relevant experiments we determine the empirical threshold suitable for the surface water extraction in han river which can accurately separate water pixels from non water pixels and obtain the preliminary water body products the confusion matrix is used to verify the water detection accuracy which is widely used to evaluate the accuracy of remote sensing classification compared to the real ground information including kappa coefficient overall accuracy oa user s accuracy producer s accuracy and other evaluation indicators foody 2002 yue et al 2020 the han river mainstream covers a large spatial range so we select three test areas fig s1 located respectively in the upstream midstream and downstream for accuracy verification 10 000 verification points are randomly generated in the extracted water vector and its buffer zone of the test areas including 5000 water points and 5000 non water points of which 2000 verification points including 1000 water points and 1000 non water points are selected each year from 2016 to 2020 then the visual interpretation results from sentinel 2 images with the same or similar dates are used to calculate the confusion matrix as shown in table 2 the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient are 95 05 and 0 901 indicating that the lsw hrm dataset extracted based on landsat images in this study has high accuracy and can be a reliable research data source finally in order to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the subsequent analysis a more detailed visual inspection is carried out on the preliminary water body products and obvious error detection parts such as buildings clouds and mountain shadows are removed we compare the surface water after visual inspection with jrc annual synthetic products fig 4 the han river water bodies in annual jrc synthetic products before 2000 are incomplete it can be seen that the water area of lsw hrm and jrc products are relatively close and the variation trend is basically the same indicating that the surface water products extracted in this study have certain accuracy due to the satellite s revisit feature in many cases the landsat images cannot cover the entire han river in the time scale of one month and there is also a certain cloud cover at the same time therefore many of the han river surface water in jrc monthly dataset is incomplete in addition in many areas there is no surface water data in this dataset in december each year this may be due to the influence of ice and snow cover therefore the annual surface water synthesized by the dataset have a certain degree of uncertainty however in this paper the special image mosaic method provided by gee is used to process all the images each year which can obtain full coverage and almost cloud free synthetic images and the annual surface water data produced is relatively complete therefore in fig 4 the water area value of lsw hrm is slightly larger than that of jrc products 2 3 2 trend analysis and significance test in this paper sen slope sen 1968 is used to analyze the time series trends of univariate and mann kendall kendall 1975 mann 1945 is used for significance tests the univariate in this study is surface water area and various climatic factors sen slope has the advantage of being insensitive to outliers and has been widely used to detect the temporal trend of hydrological and meteorological data chauluka et al 2021 gocic and trajkovic 2013 winslow et al 2015 yang et al 2020a 2020b the mann kendall is a typical non parametric method recommended by the world meteorological organization and is widely used in the trend significance test of river flux precipitation and temperature data hamed 2009 yue et al 2002 2 3 3 correlation analysis the pearson correlation coefficient is used to evaluate the correlation between surface water area and climate factors in han river mainstream the formula is as follows osmani et al 2019 2 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 y i y 2 where r is the correlation coefficient x i and y i are two parameters participating in the correlation analysis and are the average value of these two parameters and n is the parameter sample size r 0 or r 0 indicates that there is a positive or negative correlation between the two parameters at the confidence level and the greater the absolute value of r the stronger the correlation ali et al 2019 neto et al 2011 zhang et al 2020a in addition p is used to accurately describe the confidence level p 0 05 or p 0 01 means reaching the 95 or 99 confidence level while p 0 05 means that the correlation between the two parameters cannot be compared 3 results 3 1 temporal variation trends and characteristics of surface water area from 1986 2020 the surface water area of han river mainstream showed an overall increasing trend fig 5 which did not reach the 95 confidence level p 0 109 0 05 with figs 5 and 6 it can be seen that the interannual changes of surface water area have obvious fluctuation showing the characteristics of alternating increase and decrease and the increase and decrease times of area are the same table s3 we performed a conjugate analysis of the changes in surface water area annual average water level and flow of the han river mainstream and annual precipitation in the region near the mainstream fig 5 a b c it can be seen that for more than 30 years the annual average water level of han river and the annual precipitation in the region have shown a slow increasing trend both the overall trend and the interannual change process are very consistent with the surface water area although the annual average flow shows a slow decreasing trend overall its dynamic change process is basically in line with the surface water area these indicate that our water body extraction results are consistent with the measured hydrological data and have high accuracy and the changes in surface water area are closely related to the local precipitation at the same time we find that the temporal variation of surface water presents different phased trends and characteristics during the period of 1986 1995 the interannual fluctuation of surface water area was relatively small and the water area increased first and then decreased with an overall decreasing trend the same is true for the changes of the annual average water level and flow and annual precipitation in the corresponding period from 1996 2010 the interannual fluctuation of surface water area was dramatic showing the variation characteristic of alternating droughts and floods meanwhile the interannual variation of river water level and flow during this period was also relatively large the water area showed an overall increasing trend and the maximum minimum and multiple peak values all appeared in this period most of the water areas in adjacent years have undergone abrupt changes which may be related to the same severe interannual fluctuation of precipitation in this period fig 5 c for example in 1998 and 2010 severe floods occurred in most areas of the yangtze river mid downstream due to continuous rainstorms so the corresponding surface water area of han river suddenly reached its peak from 2011 2020 the surface water area firstly decreased and then increased with an overall trend of increase and the interannual dynamic fluctuation gradually tended to be stable the change process of surface water area during this period was basically the same as the corresponding water level flow and precipitation during the 35 year period the surface water area of han river mainstream fluctuated in the interval of 950 1350 km² table s2 with an average of 1143 28 km² the smallest and largest area were in 1999 955 8 km² and 2010 1324 8 km² although the interannual variation of water area is obvious the increase of water body is more than the decrease on the whole which makes the total surface water area increase by 248 6 km² over the past 35 years in a word the overall trend of surface water area during the past 35 years is wave like uplift there are certain differences and similarities in surface water area changes in different reaches fig 7 during the 35 year period the upstream surface water area showed a significant increasing trend and achieved the 99 confidence level p 0 000 0 01 while that in the midstream and downstream showed a slow decreasing trend and did not reach the 95 confidence level p 0 177 and 0 580 respectively the surface water area changes in three reaches all show certain fluctuations and the dynamic change processes are basically consistent with the whole mainstream that is they can also be divided into three stages with different characteristics in the upstream the surface water area fluctuated relatively small during 1986 1995 and the area increased first and then decreased with an overall increasing trend from 1996 2010 the interannual fluctuation of water area was relatively drastic the maximum area appeared in this period and the water area showed an overall increasing trend from 2011 2020 the dynamic changes of surface water area gradually tended to be stable and the area decreased first and then increased with an overall increasing trend in the midstream the surface water area fluctuated relatively small during 1986 1995 and the water area increased first and then decreased with an overall decreasing trend during 1996 2010 the interannual fluctuation of surface water area was relatively large the maximum and minimum areas appeared in this period and the water area showed an overall decreasing trend from 2011 2020 the surface water area showed a decreasing trend and the interannual fluctuation gradually tended to be stable in the downstream the surface water area fluctuated relatively little during 1986 1995 and the water area increased first and then decreased with an overall decreasing trend during the period of 1996 2010 the interannual fluctuation of surface water area was large the maximum area appeared in this period and the water area showed an overall increasing trend from 2011 2020 the interannual fluctuation of surface water area gradually tended to be stable and showed an overall increasing trend 3 2 spatial variation trends and characteristics of surface water with the area variation the surface water of han river mainstream also changes in spatial we choose some reaches with obvious changes for analyze for more than 30 years many reaches have experienced a process of first widening and then narrowing and their river width is pinching down overall in the mid downstream of han river fig 8 which is consistent with the decreasing trend of surface water area and from the comparison between 2020 and 2010 it can be seen that the narrowing of the width of these reaches has become more obvious in the past decade the shrinkage of surface water has weakened the river erosion and impact capacities of many reaches in mid downstream however many reaches have experienced a process of first narrowing and then widening and their river width has widened overall in the upstream fig 9 which is consistent with the increasing trend of surface water area the comparison between 2020 and 2010 shows that the surface water near the danjiangkou reservoir fig 9 a b has expanded more significantly during the past decade and the river widening trend is obvious the change of surface water area in han river mainstream has obvious interannual fluctuation which may indicate that the water bodies often expand and contract in spatial we make spatial overlay analysis on the surface water vectors and obtain the distribution of water bodies that have expanded and contracted and the occurrence frequency during the 35 year period fig s2 s3 the higher the frequency value the more frequently the water bodies have expanded or contracted in spatial over the past 35 years we find that the distribution of water bodies that have undergone spatial expansion and contraction is consistent that is the water areas that are easy to expand are also prone to shrink which is in line with the general spatial variation characteristics of surface water water bodies that are prone to expand and contract in spatial can be regarded as dynamic water fig 10 which mainly concentrates in the reaches between the cuijiaying water conservancy project and xinglong water conservancy project in the mid downstream and the reaches near the danjiangkou reservoir in the upstream the surface water in these areas is extremely sensitive and has frequent spatial dynamic changes so it is necessary to focus on preventing floods and droughts during the river s wet and dry seasons conversely water bodies that rarely expand and shrink can be regarded as stable water 3 3 influence of climate factors on the surface water of han river mainstream the temporal and spatial changes of the surface water in han river mainstream are the result of multiple factors of these climate change plays an important driving role in order to quantify the influence of climate change on han river surface water we use climate data such as precipitation humidity and temperature as independent variables that may affect the water area and then analyze the correlation between climate factors and surface water area the climatic differences between different reaches are obvious due to the large spatial span of the river in order to obtain more accurate analysis results taking into account the significant topographical climatic and land cover variability of the areas through which han river flows we make correlation analysis in the upstream midstream and downstream respectively we collect a total of 8 climate factors including the average surface temperature precipitation average air pressure average relative humidity sunshine hours average temperature and average wind speed from the daily dataset of china s surface climate data as well as the potential evapotranspiration from terraclimate we first use spss to conduct principal component analysis on climate factors the correlation analysis results of climate factors in the upstream midstream and downstream are similar table s4 s5 s6 and we find that there is a strong positive correlation between the average surface temperature and the average temperature so only one of them needs to be analyzed there are also certain correlations between some other climate factors but correlations are not so strong therefore we finally select 7 climate factors except the average surface temperature to conduct correlation analysis with surface water area in fact each climate factor has their own variation trends and characteristics fig s4 and their correlations with the surface water area of han river mainstream are also different fig 11 the precipitation in the upstream shows an overall increasing trend but that is not obvious in the midstream and the precipitation in the downstream generally shows a slow decreasing trend data show that precipitation gradually increases from upstream to midstream to downstream with large interannual fluctuations it can be seen that there is a strong positive correlation between surface water area and precipitation in the upstream r 0 732 reaching the confidence level of 99 p 0 000 and there is a moderate positive correlation between surface water area and precipitation in the midstream and downstream r 0 413 and 0 400 both reaching the 95 confidence level p 0 014 and 0 017 therefore we believe that the change of precipitation has a great influence on the surface water area especially in the han river upstream in general the more rainfall the larger the surface water area of the river the average relative humidity in the upstream fluctuates greatly and shows a weak trend of increase while that in the midstream and downstream shows a significant decreasing trend and the average relative humidity gradually increases from the upstream to midstream to downstream there is a weak positive correlation between surface water area and average relative humidity in the upstream and midstream r 0 394 and 0 377 respectively both reaching the confidence level of 95 p 0 019 and 0 026 respectively while there is no correlation between surface water and average relative humidity in the downstream it can be estimated that the change in average relative humidity affects the surface water area of han river to a certain extent this may be because in most cases the higher the humidity the less evaporation of river surface water and the humid air indirectly indicates that the rainfall is relatively sufficient which will increase the surface water area the average temperature in the upstream midstream and downstream all shows a significant upward trend over the past 35 years the interannual changes of temperature in different reaches are highly consistent with each other and with the decrease of altitude and latitude the average temperature gradually increases from upstream to midstream to downstream we find that there is no correlation between surface water area and average temperature in the upstream and downstream and a moderate negative correlation exists between surface water area and average temperature in the midstream r 0 443 which exceeds the 99 confidence level p 0 008 it can be concluded that temperature changes have little effect on the surface water area of han river mainstream the sunshine hours in the upstream midstream and downstream all show a downward trend and the decreasing trend in the midstream is relatively significant there is a moderate negative correlation between surface water area and sunshine hours in the upstream r 0 423 reaching the 95 confidence level p 0 011 while there is no correlation between surface water and sunshine hours in the midstream and downstream therefore the changes of sunshine hours have little influence on the surface water area of han river the average wind speed in the upstream midstream and downstream all shows an increasing trend and the increasing trend of upstream is more obvious there is a weak positive correlation between average wind speed and surface water area in the upstream r 0 337 reaching the 95 confidence level p 0 048 while there is no correlation between them in the midstream and downstream therefore it can be concluded that the changes of average wind speed have very little influence on the surface water area of han river mainstream the average air pressure in the upstream shows an overall slow rising trend while in the mid downstream it shows a significant decreasing trend at the same time no correlation between the surface water area and the average air pressure has been found in all reaches therefore changes of average air pressure have almost no effect on the surface water area the changes of potential evapotranspiration in the upstream midstream and downstream all show an increasing trend of which the upstream and midstream have a more significant increasing trend the interannual variation of the potential evapotranspiration in different reaches has certain similarities and with the decrease of altitude and latitude the potential evapotranspiration has a small increase from upstream to midstream to downstream we find that there is a negative correlation between the surface water area and potential evapotranspiration in the upstream midstream and downstream of han river of which there is a moderately negative correlation in the midstream but the correlation in the upstream and downstream does not reach the 95 confidence level correlation analysis results show that precipitation is the main climate factor affecting the changes of surface water area in the han river mainstream and it is also one of the important water sources of the river precipitation changes have a greater driving effect on the surface water area dynamics of the han river especially in the upstream changes in average relative humidity evapotranspiration average temperature and sunshine hours indirectly affect the surface water area of han river but the effect is limited the changes of average wind speed and average air pressure have almost no effect on the surface water area of han river 4 discussion 4 1 exploration of the influence of water conservancy projects on han river surface water since last century in order to effectively use the surface water resources of han river and promote the economic development of the basin the danjiangkou ankang wangfuzhou cuijiaying and xinglong water conservancy projects were constructed in 1974 1992 2001 2009 and 2012 danjiangkou reservoir is the second largest reservoir in china and began to store water in 1973 and it s also the water source of the msnwd lin et al 2021 xin et al 2015 according to statistics the total storage capacity of the first phase of danjiangkou reservoir was 17 45 billion m³ which increased to 29 05 billion m³ after the dam was heightened in 2010 liu et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 wangfuzhou cuijiaying and xinglong are large cascade reservoirs constructed in the han river mid downstream in the 21st century we believe that the construction of water conservancy projects is an important driving factor affecting the overall and local surface water area and spatial morphology changes of han river mainstream the implementation of these water conservancy projects has promoted and accelerated the trend of a significant increase in surface water area of the han river upstream and a slow decrease of the mid downstream over the past 35 years especially with the completion of the cuijiaying water conservancy project and the danjiangkou dam heightening project as an important part of msnwd the surface water area of both upstream midstream and downstream decreased simultaneously after 2010 and then the upstream surface water area increased much more significantly fig 7 and accompanied by changes in the spatial morphology of surface water in many reaches the surface water expanded more obviously and the river width increased significantly in many upstream reaches fig 9 a b while the water bodies shrank more obviously and the river width decreased significantly in many mid downstream reaches fig 8 a b fortunately with the completion of a series of compensation projects such as the yangtze han water diversion project kuo et al 2019 yang et al 2012 and xinglong water conservancy project the surface water area in the mid downstream has recovered and tended to be stable the construction of water conservancy projects also significantly changed the area and spatial form of surface water in nearby reaches figs 12 14 after the completion of these projects the surface water area near their upstream has increased significantly while that near their downstream has decreased generally for example after the danjiangkou dam was heightened the surface water area of the river near its upstream showed a significant increase while the water area near its downstream gradually decreased at the same time the heightening of the dam is also a sudden change point of significant changes in the water level and flow of nearby reaches fig s5 the water level of the river near its upstream increased sharply after a small decrease and the water level near its downstream decreased significantly and the dynamic changes are relatively drastic the same is true for the river flow of reaches near the dam the river flow near its upstream significantly decreased and then rebounded obviously and the river flow near its downstream plummeted from 2010 to 2014 and gradually stabilized in addition there is generally more sensitive and dynamic water near water conservancy projects than in other areas fig 10 which may also be the result of their effects building water conservancy projects is an effective way to control and manage water resources at present the scale and quantity of water conservancy projects in china rank among the top in the world the construction of water conservancy projects will change the morphology and natural hydrological conditions of the river to some extent and even reduce the biological community diversity and affect the river ecosystem health dong 2003 shen et al 2015 the construction of danjiangkou and other water conservancy projects has significantly changed the overall and local surface water spatial form and area of han river mainstream the shrinkage of surface water has weakened the river erosion capacity in many reaches of the mid downstream moreover the spatial form of the surface water in nearby reaches of water conservancy projects has undergone abrupt changes which would definitely cause negative impacts on residents and ecological environment around the river for more than 30 years although the water level of han river mainstream has been increasing overall its river flow has gradually decreased especially after the danjiangkou dam was heightened fig 5 a b relevant studies show that the heightening of the danjiangkou dam and the water delivery of the msnwd have reduced the water quality in the mid downstream of han river and even increased the occurrence probability of harmful algal blooms shen et al 2021 xin et al 2020 yang et al 2012 however as a whole surface water area of the entire han river mainstream has been slowly increasing over the past 35 years compensation projects such as yangtze han water diversion project and xinglong water conservancy project have made the surface water area of han river increase more obviously after a significant decrease meanwhile under the joint regulation of several water conservancy projects the dynamic changes of surface water area have stabilized in recent years seen from various reaches the surface water in the upstream midstream and downstream did not show extremely abnormal mutations during the 35 year period although the water area in the mid downstream is gradually decreasing overall the trend is slow and insignificant and the dynamic changes of surface water area in different reaches have also tended to be stable in recent years importantly water conservancy projects could not only help prevent flood disasters but also promote the rational management and distribution of water resources the heightening of danjiangkou dam has further improved the flood control capacity of the reservoir raising the flood control standard of the mid downstream from once every 20 years to 100 years fu et al 2015 and alleviated the flood control pressure in han river mid downstream and the hankou section of yangtze river the msnwd has alleviated the severe shortage of water resources in north china improved the ecological environment and investment environment in the water receiving areas of henan hebei beijing and tianjin and promoted the economic and social development of north china xu et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 2021 therefore we believe that although the construction of water conservancy projects has caused a relatively large negative impact on the han river surface water and ecological environment in a short term it has far reaching significance for the long term utilization of water resources flood control etc 4 2 enlightenment from dynamic characteristics of surface water in han river as one part of yangtze river economic belt han river is an important surface water resource in central china and the water source of the msnwd and plays an irreplaceable role in the development of local agriculture and industry lu et al 2018 yang et al 2021 according to the research we find that the spatiotemporal changes of the han river surface water in different reaches and different time periods are not same that is there are significant regional and phased differences which are the result of the combined effects of multiple driving factors such as complex climate change human activities and so on therefore when managing and utilizing surface water resources of han river the regional and phased differences in surface water dynamics should be fully considered and the influence of various factors should be integrated to formulate reasonable water resources management and planning schemes in addition to precipitation the main natural climate factor the spatiotemporal variation of han river surface water is also affected by the man made factor of building water conservancy projects to a large extent therefore on the one hand relevant departments must pay special attention to the sudden change of precipitation in han river basin and formulate corresponding measures in advance to deal with possible drought and flood disasters on the other hand although the construction of water conservancy projects has caused adverse effects on han river surface water and the surrounding environment in the short term it plays an important role in flood control power generation irrigation and promoting the rational distribution of water resources that is the construction of water conservancy projects has both advantages and disadvantages under the constraints of scientific policies and reasonable management and planning its positive role is much more than its disadvantages 4 3 uncertainty limitations and challenges the surface water products of han river mainstream extracted through gee and landsat images in this paper have high accuracy and consistency in accuracy verification and comparative analysis with other data but at the same time there are some uncertain aspects for example due to the limited time range of sentinel 2 images the water body extraction results before 2016 cannot be verified by visual interpretation in addition certain errors and uncertainties may occur when visually inspecting the results of surface water extraction this study did not analyze the long term variation of han river surface water in seasonal monthly and even individual dates which may omit some obvious seasonal dynamics and short term surface water events this is due to the long revisit period of the landsat satellite and the large spatial scope of the study area the image data with full coverage and low cloud cover cannot be obtained within a short time interval which is a general difficulty for the researches of both long term and large scope surface water dynamic monitoring based on only one kind of remote sensing data source like landsat images in future work sentinel gf series and other image source can be combined to study the seasonal variation characteristics of the han river surface water moreover the dynamic changes of han river surface water are the result of comprehensive action of various factors only some climatic factors and the man made factor of constructing water conservancy projects are analyzed in this article so next it may be possible to comprehensively analyze the impact of more factors such as geological structure ecological environment urbanization and land cover changes on the han river surface water 5 conclusions in this study we concentrate on the long term surface water changes in han river mainstream landsat images and gee are utilized as data source and process tool respectively to extract annual surface water products of han river mainstream in the past 35 years on this basis we analyzed the temporal and spatial dynamic characteristics of surface water and explored the impacts of climate change and water conservancy projects on han river surface water over the past 35 years the surface water area of han river mainstream has shown a fluctuating upward trend overall and the dynamic change process and overall trend are very consistent with the river water level and precipitation the dynamic changes of surface water have obvious regional and phased differences and have stabilized in recent years climate change and the role of water conservancy projects have significantly changed the area and spatial morphology of han river surface water with the change of precipitation and the implementation of water conservancy projects in han river the surface water area in upstream has shown a significant increasing trend while that in the midstream and downstream has decreased slowly meanwhile many reaches have an obvious expansion trend and their river width is increasing overall in the upstream while many reaches in the mid downstream have an obvious contraction trend their river width is decreasing overall and the river erosion capacity is weakening although the construction of water conservancy projects has caused a relatively large negative impact on han river surface water and ecological environment in a short term it has far reaching significance for the long term management and utilization of water resources and flood control this study revealed the long term temporal and spatial dynamic characteristics of surface water in han river mainstream which can provide scientific guidance for the evaluation and management of

8017,study region ca mau province cmp mekong delta md vietnam study focus groundwater from deep aquifers is the most reliable source of freshwater in the md but extensive overexploitation in the last decades led to the drop of hydraulic heads and negative environmental impacts therefore a comprehensive groundwater investigation was conducted to evaluate its composition in the context of quaternary marine transgression and regression cycles geochemical processes as well as groundwater extraction new hydrological insights for the region the abundance of groundwater of na hco3 type and distinct ion ratios such as na cl indicate extensive freshwater intrusion in an initially saline hydrogeological system with decreasing intensity from upper pleistocene to deeper miocene aquifers most likely during the last marine regression phase 60 12 ka bp deviations from the conservative mixing line between the two endmembers seawater and freshwater are attributed to ion exchange processes on mineral surfaces making ion ratios in combination with a customized water type analysis a useful tool to distinguish between salinization and freshening processes elevated salinity in some areas is attributed to hco3 generation by organic matter decomposition in marine sediments rather than to seawater intrusion nevertheless a few randomly distributed locations show strong evidence of recent salinization in an early stage which may be caused by the downwards migration of saline holocene groundwater through natural and anthropogenic pathways into deep aquifers keywords ca mau hydrogeology delta aquifer system salinity freshwater seawater intrusion 1 introduction over the past decade much attention has been paid to environmental challenges in the world s most densely populated mega deltas bucx et al 2014 population growth urbanization climate change and the fast development of industry and agriculture exponentially increased the demand for freshwater and put the already limited resources under pressure bucx et al 2014 fares 2016 lam et al 2018 minderhoud et al 2017 in many deltas surface water is saline and polluted nguyen et al 2019 rahman et al 2019 and rainwater is only available during the rainy season therefore groundwater is the major and most reliable source of freshwater which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts erban et al 2014 ferguson and gleeson 2012 minderhoud et al 2020 2017 werner et al 2013 this also applies for the vietnamese mekong delta md the third largest delta on earth which has around 17 3 million inhabitants gsov 2019 and relies heavily on fresh groundwater an et al 2014 gunnink et al 2021 ha et al 2018 the most prominent negative environmental impact associated with groundwater overexploitation in the md is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion which would substantially degrade groundwater quality limit its use and affect human health erban et al 2014 xiao et al 2021 rahman et al 2019 sohrabi et al 2021 in addition severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year which is induced by decreased pore pressure due to pumping results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers erban et al 2014 2013 karlsrud et al 2020 minderhoud et al 2015 parker 2020 thoang and giao 2015 in combination with additive processes the low lying md is threatened in its very existence those include natural compaction of the upper holocene sediment layers zoccarato et al 2018 a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the mekong river due to upstream dam constructions allison et al 2017 karlsrud et al 2017 kummu and varis 2007 salinization of surface water ferguson and gleeson 2012 gugliotta et al 2017 as well as sea level rise due to global climate change smajgl et al 2015 woodroffe et al 2007 some parts of the md are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion anthony et al 2015 karlsrud et al 2017 liu et al 2017 luijendijk et al 2018 tamura et al 2020 weather extremes and natural hazards including floods and prolonging dry seasons leading to severe droughts like in early 2020 further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater moser et al 2012 phan et al 2020 in coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of sea level rise erban et al 2014 ferguson and gleeson 2012 overall the problems can be summarized as a progressive loss of land and freshwater which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta minderhoud et al 2020 as this was acknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers initiatives like the mekong delta plan and basin development strategy plan by the mekong delta commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges reduce groundwater overexploitation and work towards a sustainable development of the md mdp 2013 mrc 2016 in order to forecast the future development of groundwater resources in the md it is essential to understand the hydrogeological system and the main drivers leading to present groundwater geochemistry pham et al 2019 showed in a regional fresh saline groundwater distribution model over the whole md that freshwater present in deep aquifers probably infiltrated during the marine regression phase during the last glacial maximum lgm 26 12 ka bp however in this previous approach only total dissolved solids tds and groundwater age were considered and no further insights on groundwater geochemistry were available detailed analysis such as ion ratios and the assessment of water types provide the opportunity to describe the state of the aquifer and to distinguish between geochemical processes giménez forcada 2010 russak and sivan 2010 amiri et al 2016 therefore this study focuses on groundwater evolution and dynamics from a geochemical perspective a comprehensive groundwater investigation was conducted in cmp which was chosen as a representative study area for the southern md to study salinity patterns in a spatial and temporal context cmp is the southernmost province in vietnam located on the ca mau peninsula in the md it is surrounded by three sides to the sea and is therefore prone to seawater intrusion it is important to identify the status of the aquifers and to delineate geochemical processes for example direct seawater intrusion would lead to accelerated salinization rates while mixing of fresh and saline groundwater is much slower vengosh 2013 therefore this study has direct implications for the whole md region and contributes to a better understanding of the groundwater system and offers new insights to overcome groundwater related challenges in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 overview cmp is the southernmost province in vietnam and covers an area of 5221 km2 gsov 2019 it is part of the ca mau peninsula in the md which includes neighboring provinces kien giang in the north and bac lieu in the northeast fig 1 depicts the location of the study area in south east asia and its main features cmp is surrounded by the west sea gulf of thailand to the west and by the east sea to the south and east while the delta has an extremely low average elevation level below 2 0 m above mean sea level msl the average elevation level of cmp is estimated to be less than 1 0 m minderhoud et al 2019 zoccarato et al 2018 in the tropical monsoon climate of the md the rain season in cmp lasts from may to november which is followed by a pronounced dry season from december to april cmp receives the highest precipitation in the md due to the southwest monsoon which can reach 2500 mm year the temperature ranges between 23 c and 32 c and relative humidity is constantly high at 76 86 cosslett and cosslett 2014 gsov 2019 the region inhabits around 1 2 million people whereas around 300 000 live in the provincial capital ca mau city cmc gsov 2019 a large proportion of the population lives in rural areas outside the smaller district capitals along the dense network of rivers and canals and are working in the agricultural sector cmp has a special role in the agricultural sector of vietnam especially for shrimp farming cosslett and cosslett 2014 gsov 2019 thong et al 2010 therefore land use is dominated by brackish saltwater aquaculture and one crop rice farming sometimes alternating depending on the season and water availability and rarely two crop rice cultivation le et al 2018 nguyen et al 2020 2 1 2 hydrogeology in the late neogene comprising miocene and pliocene epochs the former mekong basin a northwest trending tectonic trough started to subside due to the uplift of the himalaya high erosion rates resulted in a high sediment supply which was deposited by fluvial transport and accumulated in the former mekong basin nguyen et al 2000 within the miocene to holocene deposits overlying the mesozoic basement a complex sequence of sedimentary layers of marine alluvial and estuarial origin developed seven confined aquifers and aquitards were identified table 1 which differ in appearance and extend over the whole delta anderson 1978 nguyen et al 2000 wagner et al 2012 the aquifer system in detail is described in wagner et al 2012 briefly aquifers consist of alluvial marine alluvial and marine fine to coarse sands as well as gravel aquitards of marine fine sands silt and clay doan et al 2018 pechstein et al 2018 wagner et al 2012 saline and fresh groundwater is heterogeneously distributed across the aquifers anderson 1978 pham et al 2019 wagner et al 2012 intensive quaternary marine transgression and regression phases had and have a significant influence on delta development worldwide as they define the depositional environment as well as intensive periods of erosion custodio and bruggerman 1987 pham et al 2019 schimanski and stattegger 2005 during the last glacial maximum lgm 26 18 ka bp sea level was as low as 130 m below present msl which correspond to around 68 m below the paleo surface of the md at that time leading to erosion of sedimentary deposits of several tens of meters pham et al 2019 ta et al 2002 based on a fresh saline groundwater model pham et al 2019 assume that freshwater primary infiltrated during this phase while sedimentary top layers with a high permeability allowed extensive freshwater infiltration rising sea levels after the lgm which reached 60 m at the end of the pleistocene 12 ka bp and 2 4 m above present msl in the following holocene 12 6 5 4 5 ka bp promoted rapid sedimentation forming large scale clayey mud facies sealing of underlying layers from saltwater intrusion pham et al 2019 at that time the entire md up to the cambodian border was inundated by the sea since then while sea levels declined to present msl until recent sea level rise deltaic sedimentation continued and the md propagated rapidly over 250 km southeastward of the cambodian border to the east sea nguyen et al 2000 ta et al 2002 the dominant propagation characteristics changed from tidal to tidal wave influenced leading to a more southward directed sediment transport and an open bay system which eventually created the ca mau peninsula liu et al 2017 nguyen et al 2010 ta et al 2002 it is estimated that the ca mau peninsula was inundated until 2 0 1 0 ka bp liu et al 2017 many households obtain their freshwater mostly for daily needs and small businesses from unlicensed private groundwater wells tapping the pleistocene aquifers between 70 and 200 m over half a million extraction wells are estimated in the md danh and khai 2015 shallow groundwater is often brackish and potentially polluted anderson 1978 pechstein et al 2018 groundwater is furthermore utilized for commercial drinking water production smaller businesses and aquaculture related industry in the last few years much effort was made to implement a tap water infrastructure where groundwater from pliocene wells deeper 170 m is subtracted treated and further distributed so far however tap water is only available in more urbanized areas due to this development hydraulic pressure heads in the main production aquifers qp2 3 qp1 and n2 2 table 1 are now steadily declining especially in populated areas like cmc where hydraulic pressure heads dropped to 25 m duy et al 2021 erban et al 2014 pechstein et al 2018 subsequently a large drawdown cone around cmc developed erban et al 2014 which disturbs the natural groundwater flow a daily or seasonal fluctuation of groundwater levels is attributed to alternating extraction rates determined by water demand rather than changes in natural recharge pechstein et al 2018 natural groundwater recharge from outside the md is highly limited if there is any as the low hydraulic gradient as well as artesian conditions before 1990 reduced groundwater velocity significantly leading to high residence times in the order of several thousand or ten thousand years anderson 1978 benner et al 2008 pham et al 1994 therefore groundwater might have even been stagnant before large scale groundwater extraction began in recent decades or generally in case of pristine deeper aquifers since the early study of anderson 1978 the lack of reliable well data to deduce the recharge area and hydraulic conditions remains only twelve observation wells exist in the ca mau peninsula whereas seven were constructed after 2017 anderson 1978 postulated that groundwater might originate in cambodia where surface water and shallow groundwater is fresh based on 14c and deuterium 18o analysis ho et al 1991 determined the recharge area in the northeast extension of the delta and formation outcrops in cambodia at higher altitudes furthermore the flow directions were determined by 14c isochrones they consist of a northwest to southeast and a northeast to southwest component with transit times of 5 6 m a for pleistocene and around 2 5 m a for pliocene aquifers ho et al 1991 hydraulic conductivities in the aquifers are in the range of 1 0 10 3 m s and 3 0 10 5 m s and porosity is around 33 pechstein et al 2018 shrestha et al 2016 due to an impermeable quaternary top layer a direct connection or recharge by surface water or precipitation in the study area is currently expected to be negligible anderson 1978 pham et al 2019 previously it was assumed that the aquifers in the md were not directly hydraulically connected but pham et al 2019 assume that aquitards are heterogeneous and disconnected this assumption is supported by the observation of similar geochemical and isotopic patterns as well as hydraulic pressure heads throughout the aquifers at some locations in the md doan et al 2018 hanh and roland 2017 pechstein et al 2018 in addition the moderate hydraulic conductivities of the aquitards do not necessarily preclude the interconnection of aquifers especially since some aquitards comprise of considerable amounts of fine sand pechstein et al 2018 wagner et al 2012 furthermore clear identification of aquifer and aquitard delineations in the area is difficult and not always possible drill logs conducted in the whole md reveal that discontinues clay lenses are heterogeneously embedded within aquifers erban et al 2013 age determination using 14c stable isotope techniques revealed that the deep groundwater around u minh see fig 1 is older than 25 ka pechstein et al 2018 and between 15 ka and 40 ka in other parts of the delta tending to increase from pleistocene to miocene doan et al 2018 ho et al 1991 hoang and bäumle 2019 nguyen et al 2004 other studies showed inconclusive results with an apparent 14c age ranging from recent to older than 40 ka bp however data validity is sometimes not given because sampling and measurement techniques are not available or insufficiently documented pechstein et al 2018 groundwater in the aquifer qp2 3 and deeper is assumed to be at least semi fossil pechstein et al 2018 the present geochemical composition of groundwater is considered to be influenced by factors such as tertiary geomorphology quaternary transgression and regression phases during the past 60 ka bp and water rock interactions rather than by recent recharge or seawater intrusion doan et al 2018 pham et al 1994 2019 a baseline study was conducted in 2017 summarizing some hydrological information specifically for cmp but also pointing out that much more research is required in the region jenn et al 2017 2 2 geochemical investigation 2 2 1 sample locations and salinity analysis the distribution of fresh tds 1 g l and saline groundwater rusydi 2018 in the md is highly heterogeneous and seems not to be correlated to depth or distance to the coast anderson 1978 pham et al 2019 saline groundwater prevails in the upper holocene and late pleistocene aquifer while fresh groundwater is unevenly distributed in middle and early pleistocene pliocene and miocene aquifers wagner et al 2012 in order to determine the salinity levels and distribution in cmp a total of 190 groundwater samples were taken in five field campaigns between february 2017 and december 2019 as recent groundwater recharge in deep aquifers is negligible due to several less permeable aquitards and the low hydraulic gradient anderson 1978 pham et al 2019 it was estimated that the time or season of sampling does not influence groundwater properties the focus was on private household wells but also samples from school wells drinking water production companies administrative buildings and smaller businesses were taken sample locations were randomly selected with the intention to cover the whole province in addition to cover the main production aquifers in cmp wells of varying depth between 60 m and 310 m were chosen to represent the middle pleistocene qp2 3 lower pleistocene qp1 middle pliocene n2 2 and lower pliocene n2 1 aquifer see table 1 since all wells are constructed in a closed system including a tap and a pump construction details like well depth diameter and year of construction rely on information given by the owner almost all private household wells are made of pvc with a diameter of 49 mm and are screened a few meters in the target aquifer prior to sampling standing water in the pipe was exchanged and the equipment was cleaned thoroughly with fresh groundwater at each location physiochemical parameters including temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec were determined on site using a multi parameter portable meter wtw multi 3630 ids 2 2 2 groundwater composition groundwater in coastal aquifers is often the result of mixing between seawater both recent and paleo and freshwater giménez forcada 2010 jones et al 1999 the deviation from the conservative mixing line between the two endmembers seawater and freshwater due to cation exchange reactions between groundwater and aquifer sediments is one of the most remarkable phenomena in coastal groundwater geochemistry jones et al 1999 russak and sivan 2010 in order to gain deeper insights on the geochemical composition and to derive these processes a comprehensive analysis for cations and anions was conducted for each sample for both analysis 25 ml of sample groundwater was separately filtered through a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filter satorius stedim biotech gmbh 50 µl of high purity nitric acid was added to prevent cation precipitation apha 2017 and microbiological processes were inhibited for accurate anion analysis by adding 50 µl sodium azide vanderford et al 2011 the groundwater samples were transported to germany and analyzed with icp ms thermo fisher x series 2 for cations and ion chromatography dionex ics 1000 with column ionpac as14 supressor ers 500 and methrom compact ic 930 with column metrosep a supp 5 150 eluent nahco3 na co3 2 for anions in the laboratory of the institute of applied geosciences at the karlsruhe institute of technology germany additionally total alkalinity was determined by measuring the acid capacity to ph 8 2 and ph 4 3 with a titration test kit merck kgaa concentration of hco3 and co3 2 were directly derived from the alkalinity results however especially in redox sensitive marine and coastal settings the difference between total alkalinity and carbonate alkalinity may not be neglected due to the impact of other buffering bases such as b oh 4 nh3 si oh 3 o or f lukawska matuszewska 2016 the conversion factor for ec to tds is highly depended on ionic water composition and may differ from the instrument value which is typically calibrated by kcl solution vengosh 2013 therefore tds was calculated for each sample using the software geochemist s workbench v 12 0 aqueous solutions llc with the whole elemental composition as input data furthermore the direct relationship between all parameters was calculated using pairwise spearman correlation the calcium carbonate system in coastal groundwater settings is complex and many processes actually lead to carbonate dissolution with subsequent increase in hco3 and ca2 custodio and bruggerman 1987 in saline aquifers mixing of calcium carbonate saturated fresh groundwater with seawater which is typically oversaturated produces brackish water which is undersaturated with regard to calcium carbonate due to the reduction in ionic strength leading to calcite dissolution custodio and bruggerman 1987 the saturation indices for calcite sicalcite were calculated using geochemist s workbench v 12 0 aqueous solutions llc furthermore si of additional evaporites including aragonite dolomite gypsum sylvite and halite were calculated the proportion of major cations na k ca2 and mg2 and anions hco3 cl and so4 2 were calculated and displayed in a piper diagram piper 1944 the water type can be derived from the upper diamond shape back and hanshaw 1965 water type analysis can help to distinguish geochemical processes and to derive the origin of solutes however divisions and percentages used for classification should be selected as to best fit the characteristics of the investigated water freeze and cherry 1979 therefore to achieve a more detailed water type specification and to get more insights on mixed water types the typical description was customized in order to more accurately display different states of salinization with an emphasis on cation exchange processes proportions of major ions were calculated and if only one cation or anion was above 33 3 it is written alone like na cl water type while if two ions were above 33 3 the ion with the higher proportion was written first followed by the second ion in brackets for example na cl hco3 a mixed water type is thus only defined if all three anions or cations have an equal share of around 33 3 e g na ca mg cl is written as mix cl 2 2 3 salinization and freshening the evaluation of molar ion ratios is an appropriate tool to distinguish between seawater and freshwater intrusion in coastal aquifers appelo 1994 jones et al 1999 russak et al 2016 therefore na cl ca2 cl and mg2 cl molar ratios were calculated and compared to the conservative mixing line generally salinization of a freshwater aquifer by seawater intrusion proceeds in the following steps appelo and postma 2004 custodio and bruggerman 1987 jones et al 1999 vengosh 2013 in the early stages of salinization fresh ca2 dominated groundwater is enriched in na and mg2 in general divalent cations are exchanged on the mineral surface preferentially to monovalent cations carroll 1959 steudel and emmerich 2013 however at a certain intensity of salinization ion selectivity is masked by the proportional increase in sorption with increasing concentration especially of the monovalent ion na sawhney 1972 in conclusion during further salinization na exchanges divalent cations ca2 and mg2 from sedimentary rocks forming ca cl and na mg cl waters simultaneously overall salinity increases while also the proportion of divalent cations increases conversely freshwater inflow into saline coastal aquifers also referred to as freshening reverses the cation exchange reaction contrary to the salinization process appelo 1994 when freshwater of ca hco3 type intrudes the saline aquifer exchangeable na on mineral surfaces especially clay minerals is substituted by ca2 and mg2 due to a higher sorption selectivity and the water type changes to the characteristic na hco3 the na cl ratio increases above the level of seawater while ca2 as well as mg2 become depleted appelo and postma 2004 custodio and bruggerman 1987 jones et al 1999 in the natural environment cl often acts as a conservative tracer and ion ratios are commonly calculated relative to cl jones et al 1999 sea water has a na cl molar ratio of around 0 86 due to the above mentioned cation exchange reactions na cl decreases below the conservative mixing line during salinization and increases during freshening 2 2 4 hydrogeological model to fully evaluate the fresh saline groundwater patterns in the context of stratigraphy and depth samples were assigned to their respective aquifer based on available lithological information as owners of private wells do not know their target aquifer and because no sufficient subsurface model was available for the region a simplified hydrogeological model was constructed using lithological data from 27 borehole logs in cmp vuong 2014 provided by the national center for water resources planning and investigation vietnam nawapi whereas six of them are part of the national monitoring network the locations of the boreholes are shown in fig 2 the model serves two purposes i assignment of samples to an aquifer and hence ii visualization of samples in depth to delineate aquifer dependent groundwater properties a layer based approach was chosen where surfaces were created separately and then stacked turner 2006 this approach is common in sedimentary environments and is widely used for groundwater mapping natali et al 2012 subsurface modelling was conducted using matlab 2020b mathworks inc top and bottom boundaries from 14 layers recorded in 27 boreholes were used as 3 d scattered input data while almost all boreholes reach aquifer qp1 except one the number of boreholes reaching deeper layers are gradually decreasing with only seven reaching aquifer n2 1 and only one the aquitard beneath as this is a typical phenomenon in lithological data acquisition turner 2006 all boreholes were vertically interpolated down to the miocene aquifer n1 3 based on mean layer thickness from the available data no information from outside the study area was used because depth and thickness of stratigraphic units significantly vary throughout the delta nguyen et al 2000 and might have therefore distorted the calculation for the model a 2 d grid was created with a 100 m resolution in latitude and longitude direction using the meshgrid command and for each layer a 3 d data interpolation was done using triangulation based natural neighbor method with griddata which was then visualized using the mesh command it should be noted that the quality of the provided borehole logs could not be further evaluated here and thus no extensive model validation was conducted based on the straightforward model approach the model does not consider discontinues clay lenses within aquifers erban et al 2013 and other potential small scale characteristics such as paleo channels as well as areas of non deposition and areas of erosion turner 2006 groundwater samples were plotted in this subsurface model to enable a sample to aquifer assignment in order to account for a thin aquitard between aquifer qp2 3 and qp1 and to account for possible aforementioned uncertainties in the interpolation it was only distinguished between pleistocene and pliocene samples samples outside of the convex hull were correlated with the nearest borehole and assigned to the respective aquifer in addition a 71 5 km long geological cross section was drawn through the model area samples larger cities and monitoring wells within a 10 km perpendicular distance to the profile were included location of monitoring wells and the course of the cross section are displayed in fig 2 most monitoring wells accumulate around cmc extrapolation outside the convex hull of the available borehole data was avoided intentionally to assure a more valid model within the verifiable boundaries therefore the cross section was not extrapolated to the sea 3 results 3 1 water geochemistry major geochemical water parameters are listed in table 2 ec values range between 571 µs cm and 5180 µs cm 21 samples have ec between 2500 and 3850 µs cm while two samples in the northwest have ec around 5000 µs cm fig 5c a mean conversion factor for ec to tds of 0 81 was calculated note that this factor deviates from 0 67 which is commonly used by nawapi as this conversion factor is highly depended on ionic water composition the conversion factor presented here is more accurate for the study area and should be considered for future water use guidelines na is the dominant cation in the majority of samples in cmp the piper diagram in fig 4 shows that na cl na hco3 and mixed water types occur in pleistocene and pliocene aquifers pliocene samples are depleted in ca2 mg2 and contain over 70 na while some pleistocene samples contain more divalent cations especially those with high ec and a higher proportion of cl sulfate only plays a minor role in the water composition is mostly below 10 and never exceeds 25 the spatial distribution of the detailed water type see chapter 2 2 2 is presented in fig 3 in this classification the dominant water type is na hco3 and na hco3 cl only eleven samples are solely dominated by cl it is striking that these samples of na cl type shown in red are randomly distributed in cmp two samples in the north of cmp are of ca hco3 and ca na hco3 type colored in blue the spatial distribution of ec in cmp fig 5c shows that ec is generally lower in the northeast and east in the west and south ec is mostly between 1000 µs cm and 2000 µs cm with some scattered hotspots of high ec above 2500 µs cm the concentration of hco3 shows a rather sharp spatial pattern and is more than tripling from north to south from around 250 mg l to 950 mg l fig 5a by contrast the concentration of cl is more evenly distributed ranging mostly between 25 0 and 250 mg l n 121 and 250 750 mg l n 40 only seven samples exceed 750 mg l and 22 samples contain less than 25 mg l cl mainly accumulating northeast of cmc fig 5b ca2 and mg2 show a high correlation p 0 94 table a1 in appendix a and high concentrations are linked to samples with highest cl contents fig a2 and a3 in appendix a furthermore except a few samples so4 2 concentrations are relatively low table 2 and are more evenly distributed fig a4 in appendix a temperature ranges between 25 7 c and 37 2 c and generally increases with depth following a normal geothermal gradient morgan 1984 no significant correlation between depth and major ions was found table a1 in the appendix 158 samples are oversaturated to calcite mainly in the central and southern part of cmp fig a5 in appendix a with a maximum of 1 34 while only five samples are undersaturated to calcite with a minimum of 0 49 besides 27 samples are in equilibrium with calcite 0 2 si 0 2 like calcite aragonite is mostly oversaturated while all samples are oversaturated in regard to dolomite all samples are highly undersaturated in regard to gypsum sylvite and halite the results for all samples including ion concentrations and si are provided in appendix b 3 2 hydrogeological model the 71 5 km long hydrogeological cross section shown in fig 6 includes samples within a 10 km distance to the profile which are colored according to their ec levels compare fig 5c aquifers are labeled according to table 1 and are illustrated in blue colors based on the 27 available borehole logs in the project region the model approach and interpolation method could adequately construct the 14 distinct layers that overly each other smoothly without significant irregularities therefore layered sequences seem to be dominant in the study area while holocene layers are flat deeper layers appear to dip down southwestward 167 samples were assigned to the pleistocene aquifers qp2 3 and qp1 and 22 samples to pliocene aquifers n2 2 and n2 1 one sample might originate from the miocene aquifer n1 3 from a depth of 310 m but is added to the pliocene samples for further interpretation for simplification the profile illustrates that ec is generally below 1000 µs cm north of cmc and increases southwestward to 1000 2000 µs cm along the cross section groundwater samples with ec 2000 µs cm are found solely and randomly distributed southwest of cmc primarily in qp2 3 but also in deeper aquifers towards nam can 4 discussion 4 1 groundwater composition the shift of the fresh saline water boundary further inland is a major concern for water management in cmp as an increase of salinity would significantly degrade groundwater resources and limit their use 40 out of 190 samples exceed the vietnamese limit for total dissolved solids tds of 1500 mg l monre 2015 which is equivalent to an ec value of 1850 µs cm see chapter 3 1 47 samples exceed the threshold for cl of 250 mg l thus some groundwater is already unsuitable for direct drinking purpose data collected in this study however also show that locations with elevated ec are randomly distributed across cmp and are most often represented by more than one sample at each location from both pleistocene and pliocene aquifers this leads to the conclusion that locations of elevated ec are not a single well phenomenon but a local spatial pattern this is also true for other ions and ion ratios as shown in figs 5 and 7 this indicates that aquifers are to some extend connected at least partly either through natural discontinuities in the stratigraphy as also recently proposed by other authors doan et al 2018 pechstein et al 2018 pham et al 2019 or hydrological short circuits caused by well leakage or well failure doan et al 2018 which are rarely considered in a regional perspective no significant correlation between geochemical patterns and depth or aquifer was found as shown by the correlation analysis table a1 in appendix a and by the geological cross section fig 6 in addition locations with higher ec are not correlated to the distance to the coast as a simple and straightforward measure of salinity ec is a useful parameter to characterize and classify groundwater resources in coastal regions potentially affected by seawater intrusion especially when detailed analysis is not available seawater of na cl type is largely uniform with a tds of around 35 g l while freshwater is often defined with a tds concentration below 1 g l vengosh 2013 meaning that even slight seawater intrusion is detectable however groundwater composition is often more complex and other parameters than na and cl are affecting ec as well jones et al 1999 this also applies to data presented in this study as shown in fig 5a c elevated levels of ec in the southern part of the study region cannot solely be attributed to cl associated with seawater but rather to the presence of high hco3 concentrations in fact around nam can groundwater with ec 2000 µs cm is of na hco3 and na hco3 cl type fig 3 and hco3 concentrations are lowest inland in the northeastern area where recent freshwater inflow is estimated to occur even though it might be limited fig 5a this indicates that the source of hco3 is not freshwater intrusion almost all samples are oversaturated to calcite n 158 especially in the south and central south between cmc and nam can fig a5 in appendix a which should lead to calcite precipitation only a few samples in the northern part of the study area are slightly undersaturated to calcite n 5 or in equilibrium n 27 one reason for the oversaturation of calcite might be the addition of ca2 due to cation exchange processes or the dissolution of gypsum plummer et al 1990 which has a si between 1 56 and 6 21 this contradicts typical hydrochemical facies evolution in coastal areas where sicalcite tends to decrease towards the sea custodio and bruggerman 1987 ca2 and hco3 have a negative correlation and while hco3 concentrations increase ca2 concentrations are relatively low probably because ca2 is involved in complex ion exchange processes jones et al 1999 it is therefore concluded that observed high concentrations of hco3 in the south of the study area cannot be explained by simple mixing and calcite dissolution another possible source of hco3 in coastal aquifers is dissolved organic carbon derived from organic matter which is oxidized to dissolved inorganic carbon it was shown in other studies that the concentration of hco3 originating from organic matter oxidation can surpass the concentration in fresh groundwater at recharge areas multiple times chapelle and mcmahon 1991 orem and gaudette 1984 in addition organic matter reduction also shifts the calcium carbonate equilibria due to an increase in pco2 as well as changes in ph and causes dissolution custodio and bruggerman 1987 jones et al 1999 due to their marine and estuarial origin high amounts of organic matter are consistently found across all stratigraphic layers in cmp doan et al 2018 nguyen et al 2010 pechstein et al 2018 and could therefore account for high hco3 concentrations furthermore sulfate reduction directly produces hco3 and leads to sulfate depletion which is typical for freshening aquifers rich in organic matter and might therefore also apply to cmp where as a consequence sulfate concentrations are rather low kim et al 2017 chapelle and mcmahon 1991 overall this is an important finding demonstrating that the increase of ec values in coastal areas are not necessarily an evidence of recent seawater intrusion but can also be attributed to the generation of additional hco3 4 2 salinization and freshening processes coastal aquifers are influenced by marine transgression and regression cycles leading to seawater or freshwater intrusion respectively custodio and bruggerman 1987 han et al 2020 fig 8 reveals that the na cl molar ratio of most samples in the study area is well above the seawater ratio of 0 86 only a few samples show ratios lower than seawater it is remarkable that the water type of those samples below the seawater ratio line is changing with increasing cl concentration from mix cl hco3 and ca cl hco3 over na mg cl and finally to na cl while almost all samples above the seawater ratio are of na hco3 and na hco3 cl type this observation in surveyed data convincingly demonstrates the impact of cation exchange processes during salinization and freshening the customized water type is well suitable to reflect different stages and the geochemical processes associated with salinization it can be observed that na mg cl seem to occur at higher cl concentrations compared to ca cl hco3 see fig 8 probably because seawater contains more mg2 over ca2 with a mg2 ca2 ratio of 4 5 5 2 vengosh 2013 the mg2 cl ratio is shown in fig 9 and highest ratios correlate with those of lowest na cl ratios and salinization water types again demonstrating the cation exchange processes the same pattern can be observed for ca2 cl fig 10 but with a wider spread and deviation from the mixing line as ca2 concentrations are more influenced by other factors such as calcite precipitation and dissolution which in turn depend on hco3 concentrations in conclusion freshwater intrusion is or was the predominant process leading to the abundant na hco3 and na hco3 cl type groundwater in cmp the rarely occurring groundwater of na cl type above the seawater line might be in a less advanced stage of freshening where cl is still the dominant anion further freshening produces waters of na hco3 type and cl below 25 mg l as found in the northeast of the study area due to the general hydrogeological conditions it can also be assumed that the freshening process has progressed furthest in this region this assumption is supported by na cl molar ratios greater than 10 0 in the north east and na cl between 5 00 and 10 0 in the central east fig 7 it can be expected that both processes cation exchange reactions and the release of organic carbon by organic matter decomposition contribute to observed na hco3 groundwater in cmp detailed water type analysis in combination with the evaluation of na cl molar ratios and the consideration of cation exchange processes proved to be an appropriate tool to identify signs of salinization even in early stages at low cl concentrations focusing on total salinity via ec analysis alone however is not a suitable method for example three samples in the central north fig 5c have ec values below 1000 µs cm fig 5c however based on their na cl ratio which is below the seawater line fig 7 and their water type fig 3 particular these samples seem to be in an early stage of salinization 4 3 groundwater evolution and development marine transgression and regression phases in the quaternary fig a1 in appendix a caused numerous cycles of alternating saltwater and freshwater intrusions in the md and coastal regions worldwide delsman et al 2014 pham et al 2019 spratt and lisiecki 2016 van engelen et al 2021 in this period phases of sedimentation during marine transgression were alternating with phases of extensive erosion during marine regression derived and edited after pham et al 2019 fig 11a c illustrate three characteristic stages of past hydrogeological situations in the lower md the formation of na hco3 type groundwater dominant in cmp at moderate ec levels with high na cl ratios supports the assumption of pham et al 2019 that extensive freshwater intrusion occurred in the aquifer system of the md previously this assumption was only covered by the distribution of tds it furthermore proofs that the system was saline before freshwater intrusion occurred through permeable top layers these findings are evident in both shallow and deep aquifers concurrently the freshening event presumably happened in the last marine regression phase 60 12 ka bp especially during the lgm when sea levels were extremely low fig 11a which would explain groundwater ages in that range pham et al 2019 the formation of large scale impermeable holocene aquitards particularly qp3 between 8 and 6 ka bp prevented extensive seawater intrusion which otherwise would have been expected due to rapidly rising sea levels in the holocene transgression phase fig 11b and would have also led to the respective salinization signatures namely na cl 0 86 and associated water types the phenomenon of pleistocene freshwater conservation can also be observed in other coastal areas worldwide cohen et al 2010 delsman et al 2014 han et al 2020 post and kooi 2003 van engelen et al 2021 however such salinization signatures are present at a few locations due to the high groundwater exploitation rates as well as the high hydraulic connectivity within and apparently across the aquifers it is rather unlikely that these samples reflect remnants of older saline groundwater unaffected by the latest freshening event furthermore these samples plot below the conservative mixing line at low to moderate ec levels which indicates that they developed from freshwater and are in an early stage of salinization fig 8 rather than in a less advanced stage of freshening as it is the case for same samples of na cl type above the mixing line therefore it is more likely that former freshwater mixed with saline water more recently however the origin of this recent salinization is not further examined in this study but it should be noted that the md was completely inundated at around 5 5 ka bp and cmp until estimated 2 ka bp fig 11c nguyen et al 2000 pham et al 2019 the current stratification with high density holocene saline aquifers on top of low density deep freshwater aquifers reflects an unstable aquifer situation which might lead to a downward migration of the younger saline groundwater along natural and anthropogenic pathways custodio and bruggerman 1987 post and kooi 2003 it must be noted that the subsurface in the study region is virtually perforated with abandoned as well as active wells of different construction quality and reliability the piper diagram fig 4 shows that in average the proportion of na is notably higher in pliocene than in pleistocene samples which is illustrated in fig 11c this finding might indicate the heterogeneous downwards migration of saline water from top to bottom which leads to the release of divalent cations in pleistocene aquifers which therefore show a wide range of na in addition differences in geomorphology and discontinuities in the stratigraphy probably resulted in non uniform downward migration of freshwater which would explain highly heterogeneous geochemical patterns and partly inconsistent groundwater ages observed over the whole md anderson 1978 pham et al 2019 wagner et al 2012 although information on miocene groundwater in cmp is rare one sample probably originating from the miocene aquifer n1 3 fig 6 with ec of 3090 na over 86 na cl of 1 5 and na cl water type the sample is also in a less advanced stage of freshening in addition this sample is consistent with samples from the n1 3 aquifer in soc trang province bordering the southern mekong river mouth they have similar geochemistry and are described as slightly brackish but generally more uniform pleistocene samples in soc trang do also show a wide range in na hoang and bäumle 2019 tran et al 2020 which demonstrates the applicability of the concept to other coastal provinces in the md even outside the ca mau peninsula considering that direct vertical freshwater intrusion must have passed through several layers of various permeability intensity of freshening is estimated decrease with depth doan et al 2018 pham et al 2019 in addition to the depth depended observations the spatial component in surveyed data can be further examined freshening signatures are more pronounced in the northern part inland of cmp with na hco3 water type cl 25 mg l and high na cl ratios this cannot be explained by seaward directed naturally occurring lateral freshwater recharge northeast to southwest parallel to the delta propagation axis which is controlled by the minor marine regression in the last 5 5 ka until recently due to the confined aquifer situation and the extremely low hydraulic gradient in the flat low lying md the natural recharge is estimated to be negligible therefore the almost completed freshening may be the result of accelerated freshwater inflow from outside the study area due to the significant drop of hydraulic heads in recent decades mainly around cmc decreasing hydraulic heads lead to steeper hydraulic gradients and depression cones promoting more recharge at higher velocities from outside the pumping area furthermore the random distribution of groundwater with high cl concentration and salinization signatures highlights that recent large scale seawater intrusion into deep aquifers is not occurring and these samples are rather the result of the aforementioned local downwards migration of shallow saline water there is no correlation between these samples and the distance to the coast or any other consistent pattern which are regularly observed in other coastal areas and are mostly related to one or more discrete saline sources such as the upwelling of old saline brines or anthropogenic sources marie and vengosh 2001 vinson et al 2011 a clear fresh saline boundary was not identified as pointed out be delsman et al 2014 coastal groundwater is only rarely in equilibrium with present boundary conditions and some processes are slow however aquifer system salinization can be a fast process under some circumstances post and kooi 2003 russak et al 2016 the direct intrusion of seawater due to pumping would result in accelerated groundwater salinization vengosh 2013 while the downwards migration of shallow saline groundwater might be much slower observed geochemical patterns might be more related to a disturbed hydrological system due to pumping rather than direct lateral seawater intrusion in a short term appropriate counter measures should be considered at locations where a significant increase in salinity is evident in a longer term however it should be expected that salinization of deep aquifers will arise or continue and that the quantity of freshwater will decline if current practices are not reconsidered 5 conclusions groundwater data and detailed evaluation of geochemical signatures including water types salinity and element distributions as well as element ratios allowed for the development of a comprehensive model for the evolution of groundwater geochemistry in cmp based on the predominance of na hco3 water types salinity patterns and the distribution of na cl the groundwater evolution in the study area can be explained by the downward dilution of infiltrating freshwater into an initial saline system the freshening event happened during the last marine regression phase 60 12 ka bp and especially during the lgm 26 ka bp to 18 ka bp and shows slightly decreasing intensity from pleistocene to miocene aquifers element ratios of na cl ca2 cl as well as mg2 cl and their deviation from the seawater line were used to determine cation exchange processes between groundwater and aquifer sediments and thus to characterize salinization and freshening processes as demonstrated evaluation of characteristic element rations is a powerful tool to determine groundwater state and evolution in coastal environments this is particularly valid in contrast to the sole analysis of salinity via ec measurements which has not proven to be a suitable indicator of seawater intrusion moreover hydrogeological layers in cmp are estimated to be connected at least partly either through natural discontinuities or anthropogenic influences even though the formation of impermeable aquitards in the holocene marine transgression phase prevented extensive seawater intrusion some samples show distinct salinization signatures of unknown origin salinization due to seawater intrusion would result in accelerated groundwater degradation therefore it is important to distinguish direct seawater intrusion from mixing with other saline water sources like the slow downwards migration due to unstable aquifer conditions to establish a sustainable water management plan necessary to provide clean freshwater to the people these findings have a direct implication to the whole md region more work about the current state of salinization and freshening in the md will be conducted using geochemical fingerprinting methods like ion ratios trace elements stable isotope techniques and geochemical models by considering the new insights on natural drivers leading to the current groundwater composition in cmp presented in this study the effect of pumping induced changes in hydraulic parameters and geochemistry can be appropriately evaluated in a future study also considering pumping induced land subsidence lastly concepts for alternative water resources substituting groundwater should be considered and developed to mitigate negative environmental impacts credit authorship contribution

8017,study region ca mau province cmp mekong delta md vietnam study focus groundwater from deep aquifers is the most reliable source of freshwater in the md but extensive overexploitation in the last decades led to the drop of hydraulic heads and negative environmental impacts therefore a comprehensive groundwater investigation was conducted to evaluate its composition in the context of quaternary marine transgression and regression cycles geochemical processes as well as groundwater extraction new hydrological insights for the region the abundance of groundwater of na hco3 type and distinct ion ratios such as na cl indicate extensive freshwater intrusion in an initially saline hydrogeological system with decreasing intensity from upper pleistocene to deeper miocene aquifers most likely during the last marine regression phase 60 12 ka bp deviations from the conservative mixing line between the two endmembers seawater and freshwater are attributed to ion exchange processes on mineral surfaces making ion ratios in combination with a customized water type analysis a useful tool to distinguish between salinization and freshening processes elevated salinity in some areas is attributed to hco3 generation by organic matter decomposition in marine sediments rather than to seawater intrusion nevertheless a few randomly distributed locations show strong evidence of recent salinization in an early stage which may be caused by the downwards migration of saline holocene groundwater through natural and anthropogenic pathways into deep aquifers keywords ca mau hydrogeology delta aquifer system salinity freshwater seawater intrusion 1 introduction over the past decade much attention has been paid to environmental challenges in the world s most densely populated mega deltas bucx et al 2014 population growth urbanization climate change and the fast development of industry and agriculture exponentially increased the demand for freshwater and put the already limited resources under pressure bucx et al 2014 fares 2016 lam et al 2018 minderhoud et al 2017 in many deltas surface water is saline and polluted nguyen et al 2019 rahman et al 2019 and rainwater is only available during the rainy season therefore groundwater is the major and most reliable source of freshwater which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts erban et al 2014 ferguson and gleeson 2012 minderhoud et al 2020 2017 werner et al 2013 this also applies for the vietnamese mekong delta md the third largest delta on earth which has around 17 3 million inhabitants gsov 2019 and relies heavily on fresh groundwater an et al 2014 gunnink et al 2021 ha et al 2018 the most prominent negative environmental impact associated with groundwater overexploitation in the md is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion which would substantially degrade groundwater quality limit its use and affect human health erban et al 2014 xiao et al 2021 rahman et al 2019 sohrabi et al 2021 in addition severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year which is induced by decreased pore pressure due to pumping results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers erban et al 2014 2013 karlsrud et al 2020 minderhoud et al 2015 parker 2020 thoang and giao 2015

extraction often surpass the impact of sea level rise erban et al 2014 ferguson and gleeson 2012 overall the problems can be summarized as a progressive loss of land and freshwater which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta minderhoud et al 2020 as this was acknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers initiatives like the mekong delta plan and

regression phase during the last glacial maximum lgm 26 12 ka bp however in this previous approach only total dissolved solids tds and groundwater age were considered and no further insights on groundwater geochemistry were available detailed analysis such as ion ratios and the assessment of water types provide the opportunity to describe the state of the aquifer and to distinguish between geochemical processes giménez forcada 2010 russak and sivan 2010 amiri et al 2016 therefore this study focuses on groundwater evolution and dynamics from a geochemical perspective a comprehensive groundwater investigation was conducted in cmp which was chosen as a representative study area for the southern md to study salinity patterns in a spatial and temporal context cmp is the southernmost province in vietnam located on the ca mau peninsula in the md it is surrounded by three sides to the sea and is therefore prone to seawater intrusion it is important to identify the status of the aquifers and to delineate geochemical processes for example direct seawater intrusion would lead to accelerated salinization rates while mixing of fresh and saline groundwater is much slower vengosh 2013 therefore this study has direct implications for the whole md region and contributes to a better understanding of the groundwater system and offers new insights to overcome groundwater related challenges in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 overview cmp is the southernmost province in vietnam and covers an area of 5221 km2 gsov 2019 it is part of the ca mau peninsula in the md which includes neighboring provinces kien giang in the north and bac lieu in the northeast fig 1 depicts the location of the study area in south east asia and its main features cmp is surrounded by the west sea gulf of thailand to the west and by the east sea to the south and east while the delta has an extremely low average elevation level below 2 0 m above mean sea level msl the average elevation level of cmp is estimated to be less than 1 0 m minderhoud et al 2019 zoccarato et al 2018 in the tropical monsoon climate of the md the rain season in cmp lasts from may to november which is followed by a pronounced dry season from december to april cmp receives the highest precipitation in the md due to the southwest monsoon which can reach 2500 mm year the temperature ranges between 23 c and 32 c and relative humidity is constantly high at 76 86 cosslett and cosslett 2014 gsov 2019 the region inhabits around 1 2 million people whereas around 300 000 live in the provincial capital ca mau city cmc gsov 2019 a large proportion of the population lives in rural areas outside the smaller district capitals along the dense network of rivers and canals and are working in the agricultural sector cmp has a special role in the agricultural sector of vietnam especially for shrimp farming cosslett and cosslett 2014 gsov 2019 thong et al 2010 therefore land use is dominated by brackish saltwater aquaculture and one crop rice farming sometimes alternating depending on the season and water availability and rarely two crop rice cultivation le et al 2018 nguyen et al 2020 2 1 2 hydrogeology in the late neogene comprising miocene and pliocene epochs the former mekong basin a northwest trending tectonic trough started to subside due to the uplift of the himalaya high erosion rates resulted in a high sediment supply which was deposited by fluvial transport and accumulated in the former mekong basin nguyen et al 2000 within the miocene to holocene deposits overlying the mesozoic basement a complex sequence of sedimentary layers of marine alluvial and estuarial origin developed seven confined aquifers and aquitards were identified table 1 which differ in appearance and extend over the whole delta anderson 1978 nguyen et al 2000 wagner et al 2012 the aquifer system in detail is described in wagner et al 2012 briefly aquifers consist of alluvial marine alluvial and marine fine to coarse sands as well as gravel aquitards of marine fine sands silt and clay doan et al 2018 pechstein et al 2018 wagner et al 2012 saline and fresh groundwater is heterogeneously distributed across the aquifers anderson 1978 pham et al 2019 wagner et al 2012 intensive quaternary marine transgression and regression phases had and have a significant influence on delta development worldwide as they define the depositional environment as well as intensive periods of erosion custodio and bruggerman 1987 pham et al 2019 schimanski and stattegger 2005 during the last glacial maximum lgm 26 18 ka bp sea level was as low as 130 m below present msl which correspond to around 68 m below the paleo surface of the md at that time leading to erosion of sedimentary deposits of several tens of meters pham et al 2019 ta et al 2002 based on a fresh saline groundwater model pham et al 2019 assume that freshwater primary infiltrated during this phase while sedimentary top layers with a high permeability allowed extensive freshwater infiltration rising sea levels after the lgm which reached 60 m at the end of the pleistocene 12 ka bp and 2 4 m above present msl in the following holocene 12 6 5 4 5 ka bp promoted rapid sedimentation forming large scale clayey mud facies sealing of underlying layers from saltwater intrusion pham et al 2019 at that time the entire md up to the cambodian border was inundated by the sea since then while sea levels declined to present msl until recent sea level rise deltaic sedimentation continued and the md propagated rapidly over 250 km southeastward of the cambodian border to the east sea nguyen et al 2000 ta et al 2002 the dominant propagation characteristics changed from tidal to tidal wave influenced leading to a more southward directed sediment transport and an open bay system which eventually created the ca mau peninsula liu et al 2017 nguyen et al 2010 ta et al 2002 it is estimated that the ca mau peninsula was inundated until 2 0 1 0 ka bp liu et al 2017 many households obtain their freshwater mostly for daily needs and small businesses from unlicensed private groundwater wells tapping the pleistocene aquifers between 70 and 200 m over half a million extraction wells are estimated in the md danh and khai 2015 shallow groundwater is often brackish and potentially polluted anderson 1978 pechstein et al 2018 groundwater is furthermore utilized for commercial drinking water production smaller businesses and aquaculture related industry in the last few years much effort was made to implement a tap water infrastructure where groundwater from pliocene wells deeper 170 m is subtracted treated and further distributed so far however tap water is only available in more urbanized areas due to this development hydraulic pressure heads in the main production aquifers qp2 3 qp1 and n2 2 table 1 are now steadily declining especially in populated areas like cmc where hydraulic pressure heads dropped to 25 m duy et al 2021 erban et al 2014 pechstein et al 2018 subsequently a large drawdown cone around cmc developed erban et al 2014 which disturbs the natural groundwater flow a daily or seasonal fluctuation of groundwater levels is attributed to alternating extraction rates determined by water demand rather than changes in natural recharge pechstein et al 2018 natural groundwater recharge from outside the md is highly limited if there is any as the low hydraulic gradient as well as artesian conditions before 1990 reduced groundwater velocity significantly leading to high residence times in the order of several thousand or ten thousand years anderson 1978 benner et al 2008 pham et al 1994 therefore groundwater might have even been stagnant before large scale groundwater extraction began in recent decades or generally in case of pristine deeper aquifers since the early study of anderson 1978 the lack of reliable well data to deduce the recharge area and hydraulic conditions remains only twelve observation wells exist in the ca mau peninsula whereas seven were constructed after 2017 anderson 1978 postulated that groundwater might originate in cambodia where surface water and shallow groundwater is fresh based on 14c and deuterium 18o analysis ho et al 1991 determined the recharge area in the northeast extension of the delta and formation outcrops in cambodia at higher altitudes furthermore the flow directions were determined by 14c isochrones they consist of a northwest to southeast and a northeast to southwest component with transit times of 5 6 m a for pleistocene and around 2 5 m a for pliocene aquifers ho et al 1991 hydraulic conductivities in the aquifers are in the range of 1 0 10 3 m s and 3 0 10 5 m s and porosity is around 33 pechstein et al 2018 shrestha et al 2016 due to an impermeable quaternary top layer a direct connection or recharge by surface water or precipitation in the study area is currently expected to be negligible anderson 1978 pham et al 2019 previously it was assumed that the aquifers in the md were not directly hydraulically connected but pham et al 2019 assume that aquitards are heterogeneous and disconnected this assumption is supported by the observation of similar geochemical and isotopic patterns as well as hydraulic pressure heads throughout the aquifers at some locations in the md doan et al 2018 hanh and roland 2017 pechstein et al 2018 in addition the moderate hydraulic conductivities of the aquitards do not necessarily preclude the interconnection of aquifers especially since some aquitards comprise of considerable amounts of fine sand pechstein et al 2018 wagner et al 2012 furthermore clear identification of aquifer and aquitard delineations in the area is difficult and not always possible drill logs conducted in the whole md reveal that discontinues clay lenses are heterogeneously embedded within aquifers erban et al 2013 age determination using 14c stable isotope techniques revealed that the deep groundwater around u minh see fig 1 is older than 25 ka pechstein et al 2018 and between 15 ka and 40 ka in other parts of the delta tending to increase from pleistocene to miocene doan et al 2018 ho et al 1991 hoang and bäumle 2019 nguyen et al 2004 other studies showed inconclusive results with an apparent 14c age ranging from recent to older than 40 ka bp however data validity is sometimes not given because sampling and measurement techniques are not available or insufficiently documented pechstein et al 2018 groundwater in the aquifer qp2 3 and deeper is assumed to be at least semi fossil pechstein et al 2018 the present geochemical composition of groundwater is considered to be influenced by factors such as tertiary geomorphology quaternary transgression and regression phases during the past 60 ka bp and water rock interactions rather than by recent recharge or seawater intrusion doan et al 2018 pham et al 1994 2019 a baseline study was conducted in 2017 summarizing some hydrological information specifically for cmp but also pointing out that much more research is required in the region jenn et al 2017 2 2 geochemical investigation 2 2 1 sample locations and salinity analysis the distribution of fresh tds 1 g l and saline groundwater rusydi 2018 in the md is highly heterogeneous and seems not to be correlated to depth or distance to the coast anderson 1978 pham et al 2019 saline groundwater prevails in the upper holocene and late pleistocene aquifer while fresh groundwater is unevenly distributed in middle and early pleistocene pliocene and miocene aquifers wagner et al 2012 in order to determine the salinity levels and distribution in cmp a total of 190 groundwater samples were taken in five field campaigns between february 2017 and december 2019 as recent groundwater recharge in deep aquifers is negligible due to several less permeable aquitards and the low hydraulic gradient anderson 1978 pham et al 2019 it was estimated that the time or season of sampling does not influence groundwater properties the focus was on private household wells but also samples from school wells drinking water production companies administrative buildings and smaller businesses were taken sample locations were randomly selected with the intention to cover the whole province in addition to cover the main production aquifers in cmp wells of varying depth between 60 m and 310 m were chosen to represent the middle pleistocene qp2 3 lower pleistocene qp1 middle pliocene n2 2 and lower pliocene n2 1 aquifer see table 1 since all wells are constructed in a closed system including a tap and a pump construction details like well depth diameter and year of construction rely on information given by the owner almost all private household wells are made of pvc with a diameter of 49 mm and are screened a few meters in the target aquifer prior to sampling standing water in the pipe was exchanged and the equipment was cleaned thoroughly with fresh groundwater at each location physiochemical parameters including temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec were determined on site using a multi parameter portable meter wtw multi 3630 ids 2 2 2 groundwater composition groundwater in coastal aquifers is often the result of mixing between seawater both recent and paleo and freshwater giménez forcada 2010 jones et al 1999 the deviation from the conservative mixing line between the two endmembers seawater and freshwater due to cation exchange reactions between groundwater and aquifer sediments is one of the most remarkable phenomena in coastal groundwater geochemistry jones et al 1999 russak and sivan 2010 in order to gain deeper insights on the geochemical composition and to derive these processes a comprehensive analysis for cations and anions was conducted for each sample for both analysis 25 ml of sample groundwater was separately filtered through a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filter satorius stedim biotech gmbh 50 µl of high purity nitric acid was added to prevent cation precipitation apha 2017 and microbiological processes were inhibited for accurate anion analysis by adding 50 µl sodium azide vanderford et al 2011 the groundwater samples were transported to germany and analyzed with icp ms thermo fisher x series 2 for cations and ion chromatography dionex ics 1000 with column ionpac as14 supressor ers 500 and methrom compact ic 930 with column metrosep a supp 5 150 eluent nahco3 na co3 2 for anions in the laboratory of the institute of applied geosciences at the karlsruhe institute of technology germany additionally total alkalinity was determined by measuring the acid capacity to ph 8 2 and ph 4 3 with a titration test kit merck kgaa concentration of hco3 and co3 2 were directly derived from the alkalinity results however especially in redox sensitive marine and coastal settings the difference between total alkalinity and carbonate alkalinity may not be neglected due to the impact of other buffering bases such as b oh 4 nh3 si oh 3 o or f lukawska matuszewska 2016 the conversion factor for ec to tds is highly depended on ionic water composition and may differ from the instrument value which is typically calibrated by kcl solution vengosh 2013 therefore tds was calculated for each sample using the software geochemist s workbench v 12 0 aqueous solutions llc with the whole elemental composition as input data furthermore the direct relationship between all parameters was calculated using pairwise spearman correlation the calcium carbonate system in coastal groundwater settings is complex and many processes actually lead to carbonate dissolution with subsequent increase in hco3 and ca2 custodio and bruggerman 1987 in saline aquifers mixing of calcium carbonate saturated fresh groundwater with seawater which is typically oversaturated produces brackish water which is undersaturated with regard to calcium carbonate due to the reduction in ionic strength leading to calcite dissolution custodio and bruggerman 1987 the saturation indices for calcite sicalcite were calculated using geochemist s workbench v 12 0 aqueous solutions llc furthermore si of additional evaporites including aragonite dolomite gypsum sylvite and halite were calculated the proportion of major cations na k ca2 and mg2 and anions hco3 cl and so4 2 were calculated and displayed in a piper diagram piper 1944 the water type can be derived from the upper diamond shape back and hanshaw 1965 water type analysis can help to distinguish geochemical processes and to derive the origin of solutes however divisions and percentages used for classification should be selected as to best fit the characteristics of the investigated water freeze and cherry 1979 therefore to achieve a more detailed water type specification and to get more insights on mixed water types the typical description was customized in order to more accurately display different states of salinization with an emphasis on cation exchange processes proportions of major ions were calculated and if only one cation or anion was above 33 3 it is written alone like na cl water type while if two ions were above 33 3 the ion with the higher proportion was written first followed by the second ion in brackets for example na cl hco3 a mixed water type is thus only defined if all three anions or cations have an equal share of around 33 3 e g na ca mg cl is written as mix cl 2 2 3 salinization and freshening the evaluation of molar ion ratios is an appropriate tool to distinguish between seawater and freshwater intrusion in coastal aquifers appelo 1994 jones et al 1999 russak et al 2016 therefore na cl ca2 cl and mg2 cl molar ratios were calculated and compared to the conservative mixing line generally salinization of a freshwater aquifer by seawater intrusion proceeds in the following steps appelo and postma 2004 custodio and bruggerman 1987 jones et al 1999 vengosh 2013 in the early stages of salinization fresh ca2 dominated groundwater is enriched in na and mg2 in general divalent cations are exchanged on the mineral surface preferentially to monovalent cations carroll 1959 steudel and emmerich 2013 however at a certain intensity of salinization ion selectivity is masked by the proportional increase in sorption with increasing concentration especially of the monovalent ion na sawhney 1972 in conclusion during further salinization na exchanges divalent cations ca2 and mg2 from sedimentary rocks forming ca cl and na mg cl waters simultaneously overall salinity increases while also the proportion of divalent cations increases conversely freshwater inflow into saline coastal aquifers also referred to as freshening reverses the cation exchange reaction contrary to the salinization process appelo 1994 when freshwater of ca hco3 type intrudes the saline aquifer exchangeable na on mineral surfaces especially clay minerals is substituted by ca2 and mg2 due to a higher sorption selectivity and the water type changes to the characteristic na hco3 the na cl ratio increases above the level of seawater while ca2 as well as mg2 become depleted appelo and postma 2004 custodio and bruggerman 1987 jones et al 1999 in the natural environment cl often acts as a conservative tracer and ion ratios are commonly calculated relative to cl jones et al 1999 sea water has a na cl molar ratio of around 0 86 due to the above mentioned cation exchange reactions na cl decreases below the conservative mixing line during salinization and increases during freshening 2 2 4 hydrogeological model to fully evaluate the fresh saline groundwater patterns in the context of stratigraphy and depth samples were assigned to their respective aquifer based on available lithological information as owners of private wells do not know their target aquifer and because no sufficient subsurface model was available for the region a simplified hydrogeological model was constructed using lithological data from 27 borehole logs in cmp vuong 2014 provided by the national center for water resources planning and investigation vietnam nawapi whereas six of them are part of the national monitoring network the locations of the boreholes are shown in fig 2 the model serves two purposes i assignment of samples to an aquifer and hence ii visualization of samples in depth to delineate aquifer dependent groundwater properties a layer based approach was chosen where surfaces were created separately and then stacked turner 2006 this approach is common in sedimentary environments and is widely used for groundwater mapping natali et al 2012 subsurface modelling was conducted using matlab 2020b mathworks inc top and bottom boundaries from 14 layers recorded in 27 boreholes were used as 3 d scattered input data while almost all boreholes reach aquifer qp1 except one the number of boreholes reaching deeper layers are gradually decreasing with only seven reaching aquifer n2 1 and only one the aquitard beneath as this is a typical phenomenon in lithological data acquisition turner 2006 all boreholes were vertically interpolated down to the miocene aquifer n1 3 based on mean layer thickness from the available data no information from outside the study area was used because depth and thickness of stratigraphic units significantly vary throughout the delta nguyen et al 2000 and might have therefore distorted the calculation for the model a 2 d grid was created with a 100 m resolution in latitude and longitude direction using the meshgrid command and for each layer a 3 d data interpolation was done using triangulation based natural neighbor method with griddata which was then visualized using the mesh command it should be noted that the quality of the provided borehole logs could not be further evaluated here and thus no extensive model validation was conducted based on the straightforward model approach the model does not consider discontinues clay lenses within aquifers erban et al 2013 and other potential small scale characteristics such as paleo channels as well as areas of non deposition and areas of erosion turner 2006 groundwater samples were plotted in this subsurface model to enable a sample to aquifer assignment in order to account for a thin aquitard between aquifer qp2 3 and qp1 and to account for possible aforementioned uncertainties in the interpolation it was only distinguished between pleistocene and pliocene samples samples outside of the convex hull were correlated with the nearest borehole and assigned to the respective aquifer in addition a 71 5 km long geological cross section was drawn through the model area samples larger cities and monitoring wells within a 10 km perpendicular distance to the profile were included location of monitoring wells and the course of the cross section are displayed in fig 2 most monitoring wells accumulate around cmc extrapolation outside the convex hull of the available borehole data was avoided intentionally to assure a more valid model within the verifiable boundaries therefore the cross section was not extrapolated to the sea 3 results 3 1 water geochemistry major geochemical water parameters are listed in table 2 ec values range between 571 µs cm and 5180 µs cm 21 samples have ec between 2500 and 3850 µs cm while two samples in the northwest have ec around 5000 µs cm fig 5c a mean conversion factor for ec to tds of 0 81 was calculated note that this factor deviates from 0 67 which is commonly used by nawapi as this conversion factor is highly depended on ionic water composition the conversion factor presented here is more accurate for the study area and should be considered for future water use guidelines na is the dominant cation in the majority of samples in cmp the piper diagram in fig 4 shows that na cl na hco3 and mixed water types occur in pleistocene and pliocene aquifers pliocene samples are depleted in ca2 mg2 and contain over 70 na while some pleistocene samples contain more divalent cations especially those with high ec and a higher proportion of cl sulfate only plays a minor role in the water composition is mostly below 10 and never exceeds 25 the spatial distribution of the detailed water type see chapter 2 2 2 is presented in fig 3 in this classification the dominant water type is na hco3 and na hco3 cl only eleven samples are solely dominated by cl it is striking that these samples of na cl type shown in red are randomly distributed in cmp two samples in the north of cmp are of ca hco3 and ca na hco3 type colored in blue the spatial distribution of ec in cmp fig 5c shows that ec is generally lower in the northeast and east in the west and south ec is mostly between 1000 µs cm and 2000 µs cm with some scattered hotspots of high ec above 2500 µs cm the concentration of hco3 shows a rather sharp spatial pattern and is more than tripling from north to south from around 250 mg l to 950 mg l fig 5a by contrast the concentration of cl is more evenly distributed ranging mostly between 25 0 and 250 mg l n 121 and 250 750 mg l n 40 only seven samples exceed 750 mg l and 22 samples contain less than 25 mg l cl mainly accumulating northeast of cmc fig 5b ca2 and mg2 show a high correlation p 0 94 table a1 in appendix a and high concentrations are linked to samples with highest cl contents fig a2 and a3 in appendix a furthermore except a few samples so4 2 concentrations are relatively low table 2 and are more evenly distributed fig a4 in appendix a temperature ranges between 25 7 c and 37 2 c and generally increases with depth following a normal geothermal gradient morgan 1984 no significant correlation between depth and major ions was found table a1 in the appendix 158 samples are oversaturated to calcite mainly in the central and southern part of cmp fig a5 in appendix a with a maximum of 1 34 while only five samples are undersaturated to calcite with a minimum of 0 49 besides 27 samples are in equilibrium with calcite 0 2 si 0 2 like calcite aragonite is mostly oversaturated while all samples are oversaturated in regard to dolomite all samples are highly undersaturated in regard to gypsum sylvite and halite the results for all samples including ion concentrations and si are provided in appendix b 3 2 hydrogeological model the 71 5 km long hydrogeological cross section shown in fig 6 includes samples within a 10 km distance to the profile which are colored according to their ec levels compare fig 5c aquifers are labeled according to table 1 and are illustrated in blue colors based on the 27 available borehole logs in the project region the model approach and interpolation method could adequately construct the 14 distinct layers that overly each other smoothly without significant irregularities therefore layered sequences seem to be dominant in the study area while holocene layers are flat deeper layers appear to dip down southwestward 167 samples were assigned to the pleistocene aquifers qp2 3 and qp1 and 22 samples to pliocene aquifers n2 2 and n2 1 one sample might originate from the miocene aquifer n1 3 from a depth of 310 m but is added to the pliocene samples for further interpretation for simplification the profile illustrates that ec is generally below 1000 µs cm north of cmc and increases southwestward to 1000 2000 µs cm along the cross section groundwater samples with ec 2000 µs cm are found solely and randomly distributed southwest of cmc primarily in qp2 3 but also in deeper aquifers towards nam can 4 discussion 4 1 groundwater composition the shift of the fresh saline water boundary further inland is a major concern for water management in cmp as an increase of salinity would significantly degrade groundwater resources and limit their use 40 out of 190 samples exceed the vietnamese limit for total dissolved solids tds of 1500 mg l monre 2015 which is equivalent to an ec value of 1850 µs cm see chapter 3 1 47 samples exceed the threshold for cl of 250 mg l thus some groundwater is already unsuitable for direct drinking purpose data collected in this study however also show that locations with elevated ec are randomly distributed across cmp and are most often represented by more than one sample at each location from both pleistocene and pliocene aquifers this leads to the conclusion that locations of elevated ec are not a single well phenomenon but a local spatial pattern this is also true for other ions and ion ratios as shown in figs 5 and 7 this indicates that aquifers are to some extend connected at least partly either through natural discontinuities in the stratigraphy as also recently proposed by other authors doan et al 2018 pechstein et al 2018 pham et al 2019 or hydrological short circuits caused by well leakage or well failure doan et al 2018 which are rarely considered in a regional perspective no significant correlation between geochemical patterns and depth or aquifer was found as shown by the correlation analysis table a1 in appendix a and by the geological cross section fig 6 in addition locations with higher ec are not correlated to the distance to the coast as a simple and straightforward measure of salinity ec is a useful parameter to characterize and classify groundwater resources in coastal regions potentially affected by seawater intrusion especially when detailed analysis is not available seawater of na cl type is largely uniform with a tds of around 35 g l while freshwater is often defined with a tds concentration below 1 g l vengosh 2013 meaning that even slight seawater intrusion is detectable however groundwater composition is often more complex and other parameters than na and cl are affecting ec as well jones et al 1999 this also applies to data presented in this study as shown in fig 5a c elevated levels of ec in the southern part of the study region cannot solely be attributed to cl associated with seawater but rather to the presence of high hco3 concentrations in fact around nam can groundwater with ec 2000 µs cm is of na hco3 and na hco3 cl type fig 3 and hco3 concentrations are lowest inland in the northeastern area where recent freshwater inflow is estimated to occur even though it might be limited fig 5a this indicates that the source of hco3 is not freshwater intrusion almost all samples are oversaturated to calcite n 158 especially in the south and central south between cmc and nam can fig a5 in appendix a which should lead to calcite precipitation only a few samples in the northern part of the study area are slightly undersaturated to calcite n 5 or in equilibrium n 27 one reason for the oversaturation of calcite might be the addition of ca2 due to cation exchange processes or the dissolution of gypsum plummer et al 1990 which has a si between 1 56 and 6 21 this contradicts typical hydrochemical facies evolution in coastal areas where sicalcite tends to decrease towards the sea custodio and bruggerman 1987 ca2 and hco3 have a negative correlation and while hco3 concentrations increase ca2 concentrations are relatively low probably because ca2 is involved in complex ion exchange processes jones et al 1999 it is therefore concluded that observed high concentrations of hco3 in the south of the study area cannot be explained by simple mixing and calcite dissolution another possible source of hco3 in coastal aquifers is dissolved organic carbon derived from organic matter which is oxidized to dissolved inorganic carbon it was shown in other studies that the concentration of hco3 originating from organic matter oxidation can surpass the concentration in fresh groundwater at recharge areas multiple times chapelle and mcmahon 1991 orem and gaudette 1984 in addition organic matter reduction also shifts the calcium carbonate equilibria due to an increase in pco2 as well as changes in ph and causes dissolution custodio and bruggerman 1987 jones et al 1999 due to their marine and estuarial origin high amounts of organic matter are consistently found across all stratigraphic layers in cmp doan et al 2018 nguyen et al 2010 pechstein et al 2018 and could therefore account for high hco3 concentrations furthermore sulfate reduction directly produces hco3 and leads to sulfate depletion which is typical for freshening aquifers rich in organic matter and might therefore also apply to cmp where as a consequence sulfate concentrations are rather low kim et al 2017 chapelle and mcmahon 1991 overall this is an important finding demonstrating that the increase of ec values in coastal areas are not necessarily an evidence of recent seawater intrusion but can also be attributed to the generation of additional hco3 4 2 salinization and freshening processes coastal aquifers are influenced by marine transgression and regression cycles leading to seawater or freshwater intrusion respectively custodio and bruggerman 1987 han et al 2020 fig 8 reveals that the na cl molar ratio of most samples in the study area is well above the seawater ratio of 0 86 only a few samples show ratios lower than seawater it is remarkable that the water type of those samples below the seawater ratio line is changing with increasing cl concentration from mix cl hco3 and ca cl hco3 over na mg cl and finally to na cl while almost all samples above the seawater ratio are of na hco3 and na hco3 cl type this observation in surveyed data convincingly demonstrates the impact of cation exchange processes during salinization and freshening the customized water type is well suitable to reflect different stages and the geochemical processes associated with salinization it can be observed that na mg cl seem to occur at higher cl concentrations compared to ca cl hco3 see fig 8 probably because seawater contains more mg2 over ca2 with a mg2 ca2 ratio of 4 5 5 2 vengosh 2013 the mg2 cl ratio is shown in fig 9 and highest ratios correlate with those of lowest na cl ratios and salinization water types again demonstrating the cation exchange processes the same pattern can be observed for ca2 cl fig 10 but with a wider spread and deviation from the mixing line as ca2 concentrations are more influenced by other factors such as calcite precipitation and dissolution which in turn depend on hco3 concentrations in conclusion freshwater intrusion is or was the predominant process leading to the abundant na hco3 and na hco3 cl type groundwater in cmp the rarely occurring groundwater of na cl type above the seawater line might be in a less advanced stage of freshening where cl is still the dominant anion further freshening produces waters of na hco3 type and cl below 25 mg l as found in the northeast of the study area due to the general hydrogeological conditions it can also be assumed that the freshening process has progressed furthest in this region this assumption is supported by na cl molar ratios greater than 10 0 in the north east and na cl between 5 00 and 10 0 in the central east fig 7 it can be expected that both processes cation exchange reactions and the release of organic carbon by organic matter decomposition contribute to observed na hco3 groundwater in cmp detailed water type analysis in combination with the evaluation of na cl molar ratios and the consideration of cation exchange processes proved to be an appropriate tool to identify signs of salinization even in early stages at low cl concentrations focusing on total salinity via ec analysis alone however is not a suitable method for example three samples in the central north fig 5c have ec values below 1000 µs cm fig 5c however based on their na cl ratio which is below the seawater line fig 7 and their water type fig 3 particular these samples seem to be in an early stage of salinization 4 3 groundwater evolution and development marine transgression and regression phases in the quaternary fig a1 in appendix a caused numerous cycles of alternating saltwater and freshwater intrusions in the md and coastal regions worldwide delsman et al 2014 pham et al 2019 spratt and lisiecki 2016 van engelen et al 2021 in this period phases of sedimentation during marine transgression were alternating with phases of extensive erosion during marine regression derived and edited after pham et al 2019 fig 11a c illustrate three characteristic stages of past hydrogeological situations in the lower md the formation of na hco3 type groundwater dominant in cmp at moderate ec levels with high na cl ratios supports the assumption of pham et al 2019 that extensive freshwater intrusion occurred in the aquifer system of the md previously this assumption was only covered by the distribution of tds it furthermore proofs that the system was saline before freshwater intrusion occurred through permeable top layers these findings are evident in both shallow and deep aquifers concurrently the freshening event presumably happened in the last marine regression phase 60 12 ka bp especially during the lgm when sea levels were extremely low fig 11a which would explain groundwater ages in that range pham et al 2019 the formation of large scale impermeable holocene aquitards particularly qp3 between 8 and 6 ka bp prevented extensive seawater intrusion which otherwise would have been expected due to rapidly rising sea levels in the holocene transgression phase fig 11b and would have also led to the respective salinization signatures namely na cl 0 86 and associated water types the phenomenon of pleistocene freshwater conservation can also be observed in other coastal areas worldwide cohen et al 2010 delsman et al 2014 han et al 2020 post and kooi 2003 van engelen et al 2021 however such salinization signatures are present at a few locations due to the high groundwater exploitation rates as well as the high hydraulic connectivity within and apparently across the aquifers it is rather unlikely that these samples reflect remnants of older saline groundwater unaffected by the latest freshening event furthermore these samples plot below the conservative mixing line at low to moderate ec levels which indicates that they developed from freshwater and are in an early stage of salinization fig 8 rather than in a less advanced stage of freshening as it is the case for same samples of na cl type above the mixing line therefore it is more likely that former freshwater mixed with saline water more recently however the origin of this recent salinization is not further examined in this study but it should be noted that the md was completely inundated at around 5 5 ka bp and cmp until estimated 2 ka bp fig 11c nguyen et al 2000 pham et al 2019 the current stratification with high density holocene saline aquifers on top of low density deep freshwater aquifers reflects an unstable aquifer situation which might lead to a downward migration of the younger saline groundwater along natural and anthropogenic pathways custodio and bruggerman 1987 post and kooi 2003 it must be noted that the subsurface in the study region is virtually perforated with abandoned as well as active wells of different construction quality and reliability the piper diagram fig 4 shows that in average the proportion of na is notably higher in pliocene than in pleistocene samples which is illustrated in fig 11c this finding might indicate the heterogeneous downwards migration of saline water from top to bottom which leads to the release of divalent cations in pleistocene aquifers which therefore show a wide range of na in addition differences in geomorphology and discontinuities in the stratigraphy probably resulted in non uniform downward migration of freshwater which would explain highly heterogeneous geochemical patterns and partly inconsistent groundwater ages observed over the whole md anderson 1978 pham et al 2019 wagner et al 2012 although information on miocene groundwater in cmp is rare one sample probably originating from the miocene aquifer n1 3 fig 6 with ec of 3090 na over 86 na cl of 1 5 and na cl water type the sample is also in a less advanced stage of freshening in addition this sample is consistent with samples from the n1 3 aquifer in soc trang province bordering the southern mekong river mouth they have similar geochemistry and are described as slightly brackish but generally more uniform pleistocene samples in soc trang do also show a wide range in na hoang and bäumle 2019 tran et al 2020 which demonstrates the applicability of the concept to other coastal provinces in the md even outside the ca mau peninsula considering that direct vertical freshwater intrusion must have passed through several layers of various permeability intensity of freshening is estimated decrease with depth doan et al 2018 pham et al 2019 in addition to the depth depended observations the spatial component in surveyed data can be further examined freshening signatures are more pronounced in the northern part inland of cmp with na hco3 water type cl 25 mg l and high na cl ratios this cannot be explained by seaward directed naturally occurring lateral freshwater recharge northeast to southwest parallel to the delta propagation axis which is controlled by the minor marine regression in the last 5 5 ka until recently due to the confined aquifer situation and the extremely low hydraulic gradient in the flat low lying md the natural recharge is estimated to be negligible therefore the almost completed freshening may be the result of accelerated freshwater inflow from outside the study area due to the significant drop of hydraulic heads in recent decades mainly around cmc decreasing hydraulic heads lead to steeper hydraulic gradients and depression cones promoting more recharge at higher velocities from outside the pumping area furthermore the random distribution of groundwater with high cl concentration and salinization signatures highlights that recent large scale seawater intrusion into deep aquifers is not occurring and these samples are rather the result of the aforementioned local downwards migration of shallow saline water there is no correlation between these samples and the distance to the coast or any other consistent pattern which are regularly observed in other coastal areas and are mostly related to one or more discrete saline sources such as the upwelling of old saline brines or anthropogenic sources marie and vengosh 2001 vinson et al 2011 a clear fresh saline boundary was not identified as pointed out be delsman et al 2014 coastal groundwater is only rarely in equilibrium with present boundary conditions and some processes are slow however aquifer system salinization can be a fast process under some circumstances post and kooi 2003 russak et al 2016 the direct intrusion of seawater due to pumping would result in accelerated groundwater salinization vengosh 2013 while the downwards migration of shallow saline groundwater might be much slower observed geochemical patterns might be more related to a disturbed hydrological system due to pumping rather than direct lateral seawater intrusion in a short term appropriate counter measures should be considered at locations where a significant increase in salinity is evident in a longer term however it should be expected that salinization of deep aquifers will arise or continue and that the quantity of freshwater will decline if current practices are not reconsidered 5 conclusions groundwater data and detailed evaluation of geochemical signatures including water types salinity and element distributions as well as element ratios allowed for the development of a comprehensive model for the evolution of groundwater geochemistry in cmp based on the predominance of na hco3 water types salinity patterns and the distribution of na cl the groundwater evolution in the study area can be explained by the downward dilution of infiltrating freshwater into an initial saline system the freshening event happened during the last marine regression phase 60 12 ka bp and especially during the lgm 26 ka bp to 18 ka bp and shows slightly decreasing intensity from pleistocene to miocene aquifers element ratios of na cl ca2 cl as well as mg2 cl and their deviation from the seawater line were used to determine cation exchange processes between groundwater and aquifer sediments and thus to characterize salinization and freshening processes as demonstrated evaluation of characteristic element rations is a powerful tool to determine groundwater state and evolution in coastal environments this is particularly valid in contrast to the sole analysis of salinity via ec measurements which has not proven to be a suitable indicator of seawater intrusion moreover hydrogeological layers in cmp are estimated to be connected at least partly either through natural discontinuities or anthropogenic influences even though the formation of impermeable aquitards in the holocene marine transgression phase prevented extensive seawater intrusion some samples show distinct salinization signatures of unknown origin salinization due to seawater intrusion would result in accelerated groundwater degradation therefore it is important to distinguish direct seawater intrusion from mixing with other saline water sources like the slow downwards migration due to unstable aquifer conditions to establish a sustainable water management plan necessary to provide clean freshwater to the people these findings have a direct implication to the whole md region more work about the current state of salinization and freshening in the md will be conducted using geochemical fingerprinting methods like ion ratios trace elements stable isotope techniques and geochemical models by considering the new insights on natural drivers leading to the current groundwater composition in cmp presented in this study the effect of pumping induced changes in hydraulic parameters and geochemistry can be appropriately evaluated in a future study also considering pumping induced land subsidence lastly concepts for alternative water resources substituting groundwater should be considered and developed to mitigate negative environmental impacts credit authorship contribution

8018,study region densu river basin in ghana west africa study focus this paper reviews aquifers and groundwater resources in the densu river basin based on several past studies which adopted hydrochemical numerical modelling geostatistical techniques and several other conventional methods with particular focus on the hydrogeological and hydrochemical characteristics general water quality and quantity challenges and the projections thereof new hydrological insights groundwater recharge was revealed to far exceed the abstraction and offer great potential for other uses however the recharge rate is at the risk of diminishing due to climate change threats such as falling runoff and rainfall amounts rising atmospheric temperatures and population growth the groundwater is generally of acceptable quality for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes the hydrochemistry of the groundwater is principally controlled by silicate weathering ion exchange and sea water intrusion groundwater contamination due to domestic waste discharge mining and agricultural activities also feature significantly in the basin the emerging issues identified in this review include rising water demands impacts of climate change on groundwater resources anthropogenic effects on groundwater quality and inadequate knowledge of the underlying aquifers integrated hydrogeological assessment of the basin conducted in a holistic manner will therefore be necessary to properly understand the aquifers and groundwater resources in the basin for informed water management decisions keywords densu basin groundwater recharge hydrochemistry quality assessment 1 introduction groundwater plays a crucial role in the delivery of potable water to the world s population and most importantly in developing countries arid areas and in places where surface water bodies are limited unsuitable and unavailable groundwater supplies 25 of consumptive water globally of which 50 is for drinking and 40 for industrial use hao et al 2017 the dependence on groundwater is even more profound in most developing countries in africa and particularly ghana where over two third of the population rely on groundwater for various purposes kortatsi et al 2007 poverty and lack of institutional capacity to treat the available abundant surface waters and construct the needed infrastructure for storage and distribution has led to various governments adopting less expensive approaches to supplying potable water to settlements especially rural communities this is usually in the form of boreholes with hand pumps or in a few cases mechanised boreholes which serve as town water supplies from a centralised storage in ghana about a quarter of the urban communities and 90 of the rural population depend heavily on groundwater for their household water needs yankey et al 2011 the situation is not different in the densu basin where groundwater is of immense importance in delivering the potable water requirements of urban and rural communities supporting socioeconomic development and maintaining ecosystems the densu river basin is one of the most populated river basins in ghana with a population density of 150 200 persons km2 as compared to the national average of 77 persons km2 wrc 2007 the basin supplies about 300 000 m3 of water daily to the western parts of accra the capital town of ghana wrc 2007 through the weija dam historically the densu river served as the main source of water for some communities within the basin and the weija dam which serves the ghana water company limited gwcl water treatment plant as the public water supply system however population growth climate variability and urbanisation coupled with poor agricultural practices and wastes disposal methods have placed stresses on both the quality and quantity of available water resources within the basin adomako et al 2011a bam et al 2011 yidana et al 2018 similarly the interaction of groundwater with aquifer materials during transit or storage undoubtedly affects its chemistry loh et al 2019 chegbeleh et al 2020 and may have implications for its suitability for various uses there has been reports of massive pollution of the surface water resources from the densu river and subsequent closure of the gwcl water treatment plant at weija which led to a ban on farming activities along the banks of the densu river daily graphic 2001 wrc 2007 identified the densu river basin as the most vulnerable basin in ghana and under significant pressure due to the increasingly high population density inadequate waste infrastructure and lack of environmental awareness which threaten water resources notwithstanding the challenges which could potentially limit the availability of water resources in the basin water demand from the basin is expected to rise in response to climate variability population growth and industrialisation in parts of greater accra eastern and central regions within the densu basin wrc 2007 these rising water demands and the need for sustainable water supply especially to rural communities which are usually dispersed and remote and even in urban centres since the public water supply system by the gwcl has proven inconsistent and unreliable in recent times has shifted the interests to intensify groundwater exploration and exploitation groundwater has proven to be the most efficient and cost effective approach to rural water supply in ghana since it is easily sited close to demand centres and usually require little or no treatment prior to consumption use unlike surface water sources akurugu et al 2019 loh et al 2019 the wrc 2007 over a decade ago recommended to resort to groundwater supply in some parts of the basin as a means to meet the ever increasing water demand and other water related stresses and also as a complimentary approach to sustainable management of surface water resources of the densu river in light of the increased focus on groundwater as a sustainable resource to meet current and future demands a review on the current knowledge and mapping of groundwater resources in the densu basin is needed the aim of this study is therefore to review the literature with the main topics of 1 geology and hydrogeology of the basin 2 groundwater quantity with a focus on recharge and groundwater usage 3 groundwater quality and 4 primary groundwater and environmental problems in the basin in the process this review will address these three critical questions 1 what are the hydraulic characteristics of the underlying aquifers as the major hydrogeochemical properties of the underlying aquifer is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the system and adequate management of the resource 2 is the groundwater usage at present sustainable abstraction versus recharge 3 what are the principal factors controlling groundwater quality in the basin 4 what are the main environmental challenges in the basin 2 study area the densu river basin is located in south western ghana between latitudes 5 30ꞌ and 6 20ꞌ north and longitudes 0 10ꞌ and 0 38ꞌ west fig 1 it is bordered to the north by the afram and pra basins the coastal basins and gulf of guinea to the south southern volta and afram basins to the east and ayensu basin to the west the basin is highly populated by rural and urban settlements with over a million people and a population density of about 359 km2 about five times the national average ghana statistical service 2000 the high density is due mainly to its proximity to accra metropolitan area the national capital wrc 2007 the basin has a land mass of about 2797 km2 spanning 13 districts and three regions of ghana about 72 23 and 5 of the basin lies within the eastern greater accra and central regions respectively wrc 2007 the densu river takes it source from atewa atwiredu hills and flows downstream in an easterly direction towards koforidua where it gradually changes its course and flows southwards into the weija dam fig 1 the dam stores water for supply to the western parts of accra and surplus water discharges into the densu delta sakumo lagoon and finally into the gulf of guinea yidana et al 2014 generally the topography of the basin is steep reaching 30 and dissected with hills and rolling lands towards the north and a relatively flat coastal plain towards the south sloping less than 2 wrc 2007 the densu river basin lies within two climatic zones the wet semi equatorial climate in the north and the relatively dry equatorial climate towards the coast in the south east both climates are characterised by a bi modal rainfall pattern with variable intensities the major rainy season stretches from april may to july reaching a peak in june when the maritime instability leads to a surge in the air moisture in the south west trade winds resulting in the intensification of the monsoon rain wrc 2007 the minor rainy season on the other hand is characterised by a less intense rainy season and occurs between september and november average total annual rainfall ranges from 800 mm towards the coast to 1700 mm in the northern parts of the basin adomako et al 2011b based on data from the ghana meteorological agency temperatures in the basin are usually relatively high throughout the year with an annual average of 27 c reaching a maximum of 32 in february march and a minimum of 23 c around december fig 2 relative humidity is highest during the rainy season with an average value of 93 and drops steadily to about 41 in the dry season adomako et al 2011b 3 geology and hydrology of the basin 3 1 geological characteristics the densu river basin is underlain largely by the basement complex comprising precambrian crystalline igneous and metamorphic rocks these rocks are mainly the birimian granites tarkwaian accraian and palaeozoic consolidated sedimentary formation of the voltaian supergroup fig 3 the sedimentary formation mainly the kwahu morago group kortatsi 1994 dapaah siakwan and gyau boakye 2000 adomako et al 2011a b consist of basal sandstones medium grained mudstones and shales rocks of the togo structural unit on the other hand are highly folded and jointed and form the chain of hills known as the akwapim togo ranges which extend from the coast of accra to the togo border the togo structural unit in the densu basin consists of metamorphosed arenaceous and argillaceous sedimentary strata typically composed of quartzite and micaceous schist the tarkwaian group underlies a small portion of the basin in the northwest it comprises of detrital sediment mainly sandstone and conglomerate undifferentiated which is typically intruded by thick laccoliths or dikes and sills of epidiorite with folds along the axes that trend northeast rocks of the accraian group which underlie the extreme south of the basin have undergone post depositional igneous activity and major block faulting common rocks types in this group include shale sandstone and grit dapaah siakwan and gyau boakye 2000 rocks of the birimian supergroup occur in the extreme northwest of the basin it comprises two major lithostratigraphic units of early proterozoic age which are the birimian sedimentary basins and birimian volcanic belts kesse 1985 the eburnean tectonothermal event which stabilised the west african craton caused the birimian supracrustal rocks to become folded and metamorphosed under greenschist facies conditions and intruded by granitoids of the eburnean and tamnean plutonic suites 3 2 aquifer characteristics and hydraulic head distribution the basement rocks are characterised by little negligible pore spaces permeability and transmissivity as a result aquifers within these rocks exhibit low yields cook 2003 darko and kra sny 2003 therefore groundwater occurrence in the basin is controlled by the occurrence and pervasiveness of secondary structural entities such as joints fractures and weathered zones which produce openings for groundwater recharge flow and storage darko et al 2003 yidana et al 2014 the occurrence and pervasiveness of these secondary structural entities has resulted in the development of the weathered zone aquifers and the fractured zone aquifers these two main aquifer types contain the alluvium very thin and non existent in most places saprolite saprock fractured and fresh bedrocks within which groundwater occur banoeng yakubo et al 2010 aquifers within the weathered zone occur at the base of the saprolite and in the upper parts of the saprock and complement each other in terms of groundwater delivery the weathered zone varies from 0 to 100 m thickest in the forested areas averaging 60 m and thinnest in the arid zones averaging 10 m the fractured zone aquifers on the other hand usually occur at some depth beneath the weathered zone the weathered and fractured zone aquifers are usually discontinuous and limited in area kortatsi 1994 as a result of the complexity of weathering and occurrence of secondary structural entities the hydrogeological properties are highly variable aquifers within the birimian are highly productive in terms of groundwater delivery owing to folding and deep weathering borehole yield varies between 0 7 and 9 0 m3 h with an average of 3 7 m3 h relatively the granites deliver less water as a result of the less weathered conditions and fractures except for the northern parts of the basin where groundwater delivery in the granites is relatively high darko et al 2003 yield within the granites vary from 0 1 to 30 0 m3 h with a mean value of 2 0 m3 h darko et al 2003 observed no correlation between yield and borehole depth in the granites in the densu basin but noted that borehole yield declined beyond 60 m they concluded that drilling beyond 60 m in the granites may not improve the yield aquifers in the granites are generally unconfined to semi confined and yield is controlled by the degree of weathering and continuity of the formation s structures adomako et al 2011a b the togo structural unit along the south eastern border of the basin is highly fractured jointed and folded and the contact zone between it and the voltaian and granites offers highly conducive conditions for high groundwater accumulation groundwater yield in the togo structural unit ranges between 0 6 and 6 0 m3 h with an average of 2 8 m3 h analyses of hydrogeological data from the database of water research institute revealed that borehole depths in the densu basin ranges between 23 0 and 40 0 m in the birimian 9 1 and 103 0 m in the granites and 28 0 and 97 0 m in the togo structural unit similarly the average thicknesses of the weathered zones are between 5 0 and 27 0 m 1 0 and 32 0 m and 3 0 and 36 0 m respectively in the birimian granites and togo structural unit static water levels in the basin on the other hand vary from 0 8 to 16 9 m 0 1 13 5 m and 1 1 17 9 m in the birimian granite and togo structural unit respectively however due to the discontinuous nature of groundwater occurrence in the granites the static water levels may vary widely and not necessarily fall within the stated bounds hydraulic conductivity and permeability of the rock matrix through which groundwater flows determine to a large extent the amount of vertical groundwater recharge rate the hydraulic conductivity field established by yidana et al 2014 through the simulation of a transient groundwater model in the basin ranged between 2 m d in the middle portions of the basin and over 40 m d in some parts of the south the togo series south east of basin have been described as highly folded and jointed creating the unique conditions for groundwater flow and high storage adomako et al 2011a b yidana et al 2014 pumping test analyses in the basin revealed transmissivity for the granites birimian and voltaian to be 0 5 86 8 m2 day 31 8 m2 day and 0 38 m2 day respectively transmissivity values for 24 boreholes in only the granites were obtained the range of 0 5 86 8 m2 day with a mean of 8 9 m2 day showed a fairly heterogeneous hydrogeological environment in the granites which is characteristic of crystalline geologic formations as the only study yidana et al 2014 presents a spatial distribution map of the hydraulic head their study suggest hydraulic heads were highest in the northern parts where the densu river takes its source and rainfall is highest and lowest in the southern parts of the basin fig 4 where rainfall is lowest wrc 2007 groundwater in the basin has therefore been observed to flow in the north south direction alfa 2010 yidana et al 2014 2018 in accordance with the general hydrogeological principle groundwater flows from high elevation to low elevation areas akurugu et al 2019 alfa 2010 further noticed that on the average hydraulic heads in all the geologic formations showed an annual fluctuation of about 2 m between the wet and dry seasons head fluctuation in the birimian supergroup according to alfa 2010 was quite steady and flat relative to that in the granites and togo structural unit which he attributed to the higher water retention capacity of the unsaturated zone of the birimian therefore groundwater in the birimian do not respond quickly to rainfall as compared to the granite and togo structural unit 4 groundwater quantity 4 1 characterisation of groundwater recharge groundwater availability and amount in space and time is determined and influenced largely by the recharge rate which results from a combination of several factors and processes ng et al 2009 indicates that the principal controls on groundwater recharge are the topography soil properties vegetation and meteorological variables such as precipitation temperature wind etc which interrelate to create the unique conditions that result in groundwater recharge an estimation of spatial and temporal variation of groundwater recharge is prerequisite for resourceful management of aquifers particularly where these estimates form the basis for assigning groundwater withdrawal rates yidana et al 2014 akurugu et al 2019 the groundwater studies reviewed in this study estimated groundwater recharge for the densu basin adopting various approaches a water balance analysis for the basin by wrc 2007 based on analysis of weighted rainfall distribution and actual evapotranspiration estimated total rainfall over the basin to 3198 million m3 year 1230 mm year of which approximately 14 ended up as groundwater recharge mean annual rainfall of the southern coastal plains ranged between 800 and 900 mm and approaches 1600 1700 mm in the northern part of the basin where the densu river has its headwaters wrc 2007 similarly to assess rainfall duration and intensity variation and their impact on the availability of water resources in the densu basin alfa et al 2011 used daily rainfall data in a physical based hydrological model to estimate a water balance for the basin their study put recharge rate in the densu basin at approximately 120 mm year in the birimian 153 mm year in the togo and 140 mm year in the granites which represent 8 13 and 12 of the annual rainfall respectively however they speculated that these recharge rates were at the risk of diminishing as a result of the imminent threats from climate change due to a fall in the intensity of rainfall events as forecasted in a report by the environmental protection agency epa 2000 using a transient numerical model yidana et al 2014 estimated comparable recharge rates of 10 12 in 2006 2008 of the annual precipitation recharge is generally regarded one of the most challenging uncertain parameters to adequately estimate in hydrological studies dripps and bradbury 2007 consequently it is recommended to adopt different methods in recharge estimate studies to minimise the uncertainties associated with using a single approach adomako et al 2010 acknowledged the importance of multiple approaches to recharge estimates and the fact that groundwater recharge estimates stemming from field measurements raises questions of spatial and temporal representativeness of the samples scanlon et al 2002 they therefore applied both numerical modelling of the unsaturated water flow and the approximate peak shift methods for recharge estimation they estimated groundwater recharge in the basin to range between 94 and 182 mm year 7 2 13 9 of annual rainfall and 110 250 mm year 8 4 19 1 of annual rainfall using numerical modelling and the approximate peak shift methods respectively based on isotope data their study further revealed that evaporation was an active process below the ground surface reaching a depth of 2 75 m and attenuating beyond that depth adomako et al 2010 the recharge studies in the basin estimate rates in the same order of magnitude table 1 but depart in terms of the spatial distribution of these values whereas yidana et al 2014 suggests the highest recharge rates occur in the central parts of the basin located in the granites and the lowest in the northern part fig 3 alfa et al 2011 suggest the togo structural unit in the southern part fig 4 receive the highest recharge rates the observed spatial variation in recharge rates by these studies arise from the difference in the approaches to recharge estimates and the spatial distribution and representation of point measurements which serve as inputs for these recharge rates as highlighted by dripps and bradbury 2007 fig 5 4 2 groundwater use understanding of the spatial distribution and quantification of groundwater resources in the basin is prerequisite for adequate management of the resource most of the studies in the basin have pointed out that groundwater recharge exceeds net demand from the literature search the hydrological models by alfa 2010 and yidana et al 2014 appear to be the only numerical groundwater flow model in the basin both studies failed to model the lithostratigraphy of the basin which is critical for a proper conceptualisation of the basin similarly a groundwater budget for the basin appears to be significantly missing in the discussions although projections based on groundwater recharge and scenario analysis appear to give a close picture of the water budget of the basin abstraction versus recharge scenario analyses by yidana et al 2014 suggest the aquifer in the basin could not sustain increased abstractions by up to 20 from 2009 to 2024 as heads fall to about 4 m and suggests a safe annual increment of 5 in groundwater abstraction the densu river basin is one of the most populated and exploited basins in ghana a large proportion of water demand in the basin and some western parts of accra is supplied through abstraction and treatment of water from the river at koforidua nsawam new tafo apedwa and akwadum alfa 2010 however groundwater resources contribute significantly to the water needs of the indigenes alfa 2010 estimated over 600 boreholes exist in the basin most of which are fitted with hand pumps for small community abstractions mechanised boreholes exist in a few places where they are used for industrial water supply small town water supply or bottled water production wrc 2007 table 2 presents abstraction estimates from piped and non piped groundwater supply schemes in the densu basin based on field interviews and the water resources commission ghana the wrc 2007 estimate based on abstraction licences and field inspections that groundwater abstractions through piped systems total 3 316 390 m3 year whereas those to rural communities through non piped systems could amount to about 1 400 000 m3 year however there are abstractions in the basin by private homes and commercial bottled sachet water producing companies which the water resources commission estimate at about 1 400 000 m3 year therefore the total groundwater abstracted in the densu basin amounts to approximately 6 million cubic metres per year 4 2 1 scenario analysis the sustainability of groundwater resources in the basin is being assessed using hypothetical scenarios amidst the available information on recharge and abstraction for instance assuming the least estimated recharge rate 94 mm year by adomako et al 2010 as reviewed in this study and given the total area of 2500 km2 of the densu basin would result in 235 000 000 m3 year as recharge however approximately 6 million cubic metres of groundwater is abstracted annually from the basin which represents 2 5 of the assumed recharge rate based on the estimated abstraction and recharge rates there appears to be sufficient water in the basin theoretically for domestic and industrial purposes although it is noteworthy that this is an extrapolation of the estimated recharge rate over the entire basin and as a result some boreholes located in the populous parts of the basin could experience local overexploitations adomako et al 2010 furthermore the assumption that all the groundwater resources in the basin is available for usage may not be entirely accurate since pollution of same resulting from anthropogenic and geogenic sources may render some of it unusable similarly climate change is projected to cause a reduction in available groundwater resources in sub sahara africa ipcc 2019 whereas population growth and urbanisation is expected to place more demand on the resource these factors would definitely cause the fraction of the groundwater recharge that is consumed 2 5 to rise significantly 5 groundwater hydrochemistry hydrochemical studies from wells in the basin suggest that groundwater is generally of acceptable quality for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes tay and kortatsi 2008 except for a few instances where the groundwater was unsuitable for some purpose table 3 in the densu basin and ghana as a whole most boreholes or hand dug wells are usually constructed for domestic and industrial water supply purposes and not for research as a result research studies using these boreholes hand dug wells give an integrated information about the groundwater system and not depth specific information the groundwater in the basin is generally fresh to brackish with electrical conductivity ec ranging between 96 6 and 10 070 µs cm from north to south adomako et al 2011a b observed an average ec of 1288 µs cm which exceeds the who 2017 recommended value of 1000 µs cm for potable water similarly yidana et al 2018 observed that about 50 of the groundwater samples had tds values exceeding 1000 mg l as opposed to the who 2017 recommended value of 500 mg l the increasing trend in dissolved ions from the north to south corroborates the assertions by most studies in the basin adomako et al 2011a alfa 2010 alfa et al 2011 yidana et al 2014 2018 that groundwater flow is from the north to the south see section 3 2 these studies identify the north and south of the basin as recharge and discharge zones respectively during infiltration of precipitation through the rock media down the subsurface it dissolves minerals and carries the dissolved ions along its path as such ec is usually lowest at points of infiltration designated as recharge zones and highest at discharge points thus after it has travelled through the rock media and characteristically dissolved ions along its flow path freeze and cherry 1979 chegbeleh et al 2020 ph on the other hand is slightly acidic to alkaline and ranges between 5 4 and 7 8 fianko et al 2010 adomako et al 2011a yidana et al 2018 this ph range falls within the ph ranges for natural waters 4 5 8 5 freeze and cherry 1979 langmuir 1997 yidana et al 2018 observed that less than 25 of the groundwater in the basin present ph values lower than 6 5 but higher than 6 0 whereas over 75 fell within the recommended who 2017 standard of 6 5 8 5 for potable water na and hco3 are the dominant cation and anion in the groundwater system na appears to be homogeneously distributed except for a few locations especially towards the coast where the values exceed the recommended value of 200 mg l who 2017 and reaching over 1700 mg l the dominance of bicarbonate in the basin suggest the groundwater is relatively fresh except for the southern parts where conditions such as sea water intrusion and a long residence time cause cl prevalence over bicarbonate yidana et al 2018 as such the main water types in the basin include ca mg hco3 na ca hco3 and nacl mixed water types adomako et al 2011a bam et al 2011 yidana et al 2018 these studies suggest groundwater chemistry in the basin is controlled principally by silicate weathering ion exchange sea water intrusion and in some instances contamination from anthropogenic activities table 3 presents a summary of the hydrochemical studies in the basin 5 1 conceptual groundwater flow the groundwater flow regime for the basin has been reconstructed based on review of conceptual flow postulates using hydrochemical data fianko et al 2010 gibrilla et al 2010 adomako et al 2011a b yidana et al 2018 and hydraulic head distribution based on the calibration of groundwater models alfa 2010 yidana et al 2014 groundwater flow in the basins follows the topographic configuration of the terrain according to the general hydrogeologic principles flowing from high to low elevation areas there is a general dominant north south flow direction and some northeast southwest flow patterns as well with intermittent local flow patterns in the central sections of the basin which is generally undefined fig 6 the northern parts of the basin have the highest elevations reaching 700 m and has been noted as the recharge zone in the basin fianko et al 2010 gibrilla et al 2010 yidana et al 2014 groundwater in the north of the basin is characteristically weakly mineralised with tds hardly exceeding 400 mg l and dominated by hco3 gibrilla et al 2010 yidana et al 2018 fig 6 consistent with recharge zones in the flow regime some topographic highs in the eastern and western sections of the basin can also be recognised as recharge zones in the flow regime as water samples in such areas exhibit similar hydrochemical characteristics as those in the north fig 6 the southern part of the basin is characteristically low in elevation towards the gulf of guinea reaching 5 m where the densu river discharges into the sea the groundwater evolves into mainly a na cl water type in such areas which is characterised by high mineralisation with tds reaching 2000 mg l towards the coast yidana et al 2018 noted that groundwater in discharge areas in the densu basin in the flow regime had the highest levels of hydrochemical parameters and were located in the lowest elevations mixed water types dominated by na hco3 mg hco3 ca na hco3 na ca hco3 etc are notably present in the intermediate flow zones occurs between the recharge and discharge zones generally tds in the densu basin appears relatively low which has been attributed to the slow decompositions of crystalline rocks of the birimian supergroup and granitoids of the eburnean and tamnean plutonic suites which underlie about 90 of the area 6 primary groundwater and environmental problems the densu basin is characterised by accelerating environmental degradation water resources in the basin are increasingly diminishing in quantity and quality as a result of increasing population climate change urbanisation and expanded use of the resource for irrigation fisheries industrial activities ecosystem services etc wrc 2007 ghana national water policy document 2007 the traditional bush fallowing system of farming accompanied by slash and burn contributes significantly to deforestation similarly mining activities in the birimian formation around the east akim district sand winning stone quarrying and illegal fishing methods such as the use of explosives and chemicals contribute to the diminishing water quantity and quality problems in the basin wrc 2007 several other studies have mentioned indiscriminate waste disposal in the basin as a source of worry for the environment and a major factor in the pollution of both surface and groundwater bodies wrc 2007 fianko et al 2010 adomako et al 2011a yidana et al 2018 waste discharge to surface water bodies especially rivers has been predicted to increase by up to 10 times the presents amount wrc 2007 increasing urbanisation population growth and industrialisation occur with attendant increasing thinning of the forest with climate change implications average temperatures in ghana have reportedly increased by 1 c from 1960 to 2000 and are projected to rise between 1 7 and 2 04 c over the next 20 years simulations of historical climate data suggest 10 20 change in rainfall and a reduction in runoffs of 15 20 over the coming 20 year period wrc 2007 climate change scenarios also revealed a reduction in groundwater recharge at a rate of 5 10 during the same period water resources have been predicted to be at the centre of the impacts of climate change by extensive studies which adopted two of the most important drivers of the hydrological cycle temperature and rainfall for such analyses kusangaya et al 2014 nkhonjera 2017 asare nuamah and botchway 2019 the ipcc 2019 holds that potential impacts of climate change on water resources is expected to increase in magnitude diversity and severity if the observed climate change in the last 100 years persist into the future it further projects a reduction in soil moisture and runoff where major river basins show a decreasing trend in runoff of up to 17 in arid and semiarid regions in africa 7 conclusions and recommendations groundwater has always been crucial in the delivery of the water demands of rural communities and small towns in ghana it is gradually gaining similar attention in the big cities mainly due to the diminishing trend in the quantity and quality of surface water bodies in the country this review sought to assess groundwater resources in the densu basin with focus on hydrogeological properties hydrochemical characteristics general quality and quantity challenges and the projections thereof the review revealed that groundwater in the basin flows in the north south direction with the hydraulic head fluctuation of about 2 m between the wet and dry seasons generally there is inadequate lack of literature on hydraulic characteristics such as hydraulic conductivity transmissivity porosity yield etc and general lithostratigraphy description of aquifers and the basin for proper understanding of the general hydrogeology of the basin groundwater recharge in the densu basin was observed to far exceed the reported abstraction rate which implies that the resource has potential to be expanded for other uses such as irrigation agriculture although the recharge rate may be at the risk of diminishing in the future as a result of climate change impacts on the rainfall events quality studies showed that groundwater in the basin is generally of acceptable quality for various purposes except for instances where contamination as a result of domestic waste discharge mining and agricultural activities render the groundwater unsuitable especially where significant levels of nitrates iron chloride sulphate etc were detected the hydrochemistry of the basin is controlled principally by silicate weathering ion exchange and sea water intrusion challenges such as rising water demands impacts of climate change on groundwater resources anthropogenic effects on groundwater quality and inadequate knowledge of the underlying aquifers require much attention hence it is recommended that an integrated hydrogeological assessment of the basin is conducted in a holistic manner in a bid to adequately understand the aquifers and groundwater resources in the basin for informed water management decisions

8018,study region densu river basin in ghana west africa study focus this paper reviews aquifers and groundwater resources in the densu river basin based on several past studies which adopted hydrochemical numerical modelling geostatistical techniques and several other conventional methods with particular focus on the hydrogeological and hydrochemical characteristics general water quality and quantity challenges and the projections thereof new hydrological insights groundwater recharge was revealed to far exceed the abstraction and offer great potential for other uses however the recharge rate is at the risk of diminishing due to climate change threats such as falling runoff and rainfall amounts rising atmospheric temperatures and population growth the groundwater is generally of acceptable quality for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes the hydrochemistry of the groundwater is principally controlled by silicate weathering ion exchange and sea water intrusion groundwater contamination due to domestic waste discharge mining and agricultural activities also feature significantly in the basin the emerging issues identified in this review include rising water demands impacts of climate change on groundwater resources anthropogenic effects on groundwater quality and inadequate knowledge of the underlying aquifers integrated hydrogeological assessment of the basin conducted in a holistic manner will therefore be necessary to properly understand the aquifers and groundwater resources in the basin for informed water management decisions keywords densu basin groundwater recharge hydrochemistry quality assessment 1 introduction groundwater plays a crucial role in the delivery of potable water to the world s population and most importantly in developing countries arid areas and in places where surface water bodies are limited unsuitable and unavailable groundwater supplies 25 of consumptive water globally of which 50 is for drinking and 40 for industrial use hao et al 2017 the dependence on groundwater is even more profound in most developing countries in africa and particularly ghana where over two third of the population rely on groundwater for various purposes kortatsi et al 2007 poverty and lack of institutional capacity to treat the available abundant surface waters and construct the needed infrastructure for storage and distribution has led to various governments adopting less expensive approaches to supplying potable water to settlements especially rural communities this is usually in the form of boreholes with hand pumps or in a few cases mechanised boreholes which serve as town water supplies from a centralised storage in ghana about a quarter of the urban communities and 90 of the rural population depend heavily on groundwater for their household water needs yankey et al 2011 the situation is not different in the densu basin where groundwater is of immense importance in delivering the potable water requirements of urban and rural communities supporting socioeconomic development and maintaining ecosystems the densu river basin is one of the most populated river basins in ghana with a population density of 150 200 persons km2 as compared to the national average of 77 persons km2 wrc 2007 the basin supplies about 300 000 m3 of water daily to the western parts of accra the capital town of ghana wrc 2007 through the weija dam historically the densu river served as the main source of water for some communities within the basin and the weija dam which serves the ghana water company limited gwcl water treatment plant as the public water supply system however population growth climate variability and urbanisation coupled with poor agricultural practices and wastes disposal methods have placed stresses on both the quality and quantity of available water resources within the basin adomako et al 2011a bam et al 2011 yidana et al 2018 similarly the interaction of groundwater with aquifer materials during transit or storage undoubtedly affects its chemistry loh et al 2019 chegbeleh et al 2020 and may have implications for its suitability for various uses there has been reports of massive pollution of the surface water resources from the densu river and subsequent closure of the gwcl water treatment plant at weija which led to a ban on farming activities along the banks of the densu river daily graphic 2001 wrc 2007 identified the densu river basin as the most vulnerable basin in ghana and under significant pressure due to the increasingly high population density inadequate waste infrastructure and lack of environmental awareness which threaten water resources notwithstanding the challenges which could potentially limit the availability of water resources in the basin water demand from the basin is expected to rise in response to climate variability population growth and industrialisation in parts of greater accra eastern and central regions within the densu basin wrc 2007 these rising water demands and the need for sustainable water supply especially to rural communities which are usually dispersed and remote and even in urban centres since the public water supply system by the gwcl has proven inconsistent and unreliable in recent times has shifted the interests to intensify groundwater exploration and exploitation groundwater has proven to be the most efficient and cost effective approach to rural water supply in ghana since it is easily sited close to demand centres and usually require little or no treatment prior to consumption use unlike surface water sources akurugu et al 2019 loh et al 2019 the wrc 2007 over a decade ago recommended to resort to groundwater supply in some parts of the basin as a means to meet the ever increasing water demand and other water related stresses and also as a complimentary approach to sustainable management of surface water resources of the densu river in light of the increased focus on groundwater as a sustainable resource to meet current and future demands a review on the current knowledge and mapping of groundwater resources in the densu basin is needed the aim of this study is therefore to review the literature with the main topics of 1 geology and hydrogeology of the basin 2 groundwater quantity with a focus on recharge and groundwater usage 3 groundwater quality and 4 primary groundwater and environmental problems in the basin in the process this review will address these three critical questions 1 what are the hydraulic characteristics of the underlying aquifers as the major hydrogeochemical properties of the underlying aquifer is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the system and adequate management of the resource 2 is the groundwater usage at present sustainable abstraction versus recharge 3 what are the principal factors controlling groundwater quality in the basin 4 what are the main environmental challenges in the basin 2 study area the densu river basin is located in south western ghana between latitudes 5 30ꞌ and 6 20ꞌ north and longitudes 0 10ꞌ and 0 38ꞌ west fig 1 it is bordered to the north by the afram and pra basins the coastal basins and gulf of guinea to the south southern volta and afram basins to the east and ayensu basin to the west the basin is highly populated by rural and urban settlements with over a million people and a population density of about 359 km2 about five times the national average ghana statistical service 2000 the high density is due mainly to its proximity to accra metropolitan area the national capital wrc 2007 the basin has a land mass of about 2797 km2 spanning 13 districts and three regions of ghana about 72 23 and 5 of the basin lies within the eastern greater accra and central regions respectively wrc 2007 the densu river takes it source from atewa atwiredu hills and flows downstream in an easterly direction towards koforidua where it gradually changes its course and flows southwards into the weija dam fig 1 the dam stores water for supply to the western parts of accra and surplus water discharges into the densu delta sakumo lagoon and finally into the gulf of guinea yidana et al 2014 generally the topography of the basin is steep reaching 30 and dissected with hills and rolling lands towards the north and a relatively flat coastal plain towards the south sloping less than 2 wrc 2007 the densu river basin lies within two climatic zones the wet semi equatorial climate in the north and the relatively dry equatorial climate towards the coast in the south east both climates are characterised by a bi modal rainfall pattern with variable intensities the major rainy season stretches from april may to july reaching a peak in june when the maritime instability leads to a surge in the air moisture in the south west trade winds resulting in the intensification of the monsoon rain wrc 2007 the minor rainy season on the other hand is characterised by a less intense rainy season and occurs between september and november average total annual rainfall ranges from 800 mm towards the coast to 1700 mm in the northern parts of the basin adomako et al 2011b based on data from the ghana meteorological agency temperatures in the basin are usually relatively high throughout the year with an annual average of 27 c reaching a maximum of 32 in february march and a minimum of 23 c around december fig 2 relative humidity is highest during the rainy season with an average value of 93 and drops steadily to about 41 in the dry season adomako et al 2011b 3 geology and hydrology of the basin 3 1 geological characteristics the densu river basin is underlain largely by the basement complex comprising precambrian crystalline igneous and metamorphic rocks these rocks are mainly the birimian granites tarkwaian accraian and palaeozoic consolidated sedimentary formation of the voltaian supergroup fig 3 the sedimentary formation mainly the kwahu morago group kortatsi 1994 dapaah siakwan and gyau boakye 2000 adomako et al 2011a b consist of basal sandstones medium grained mudstones and shales rocks of the togo structural unit on the other hand are highly folded and jointed and form the chain of hills known as the akwapim togo ranges which extend from the coast of accra to the togo border the togo structural unit in the densu basin consists of metamorphosed arenaceous and argillaceous sedimentary strata typically composed of quartzite and micaceous schist the tarkwaian group underlies a small portion of the basin in the northwest it comprises of detrital sediment mainly sandstone and conglomerate undifferentiated which is typically intruded by thick laccoliths or dikes and sills of epidiorite with folds along the axes that trend northeast rocks of the accraian group which underlie the extreme south of the basin have undergone post depositional igneous activity and major block faulting common rocks types in this group include shale sandstone and grit dapaah siakwan and gyau boakye 2000 rocks of the birimian supergroup occur in the extreme northwest of the basin it comprises two major lithostratigraphic units of early proterozoic age which are the birimian sedimentary basins and birimian volcanic belts kesse 1985 the eburnean tectonothermal event which stabilised the west african craton caused the birimian supracrustal rocks to become folded and metamorphosed under greenschist facies conditions and intruded by granitoids of the eburnean and tamnean plutonic suites 3 2 aquifer characteristics and hydraulic head distribution the basement rocks are characterised by little negligible pore spaces permeability and transmissivity as a result aquifers within these rocks exhibit low yields cook 2003 darko and kra sny 2003 therefore groundwater occurrence in the basin is controlled by the occurrence and pervasiveness of secondary structural entities such as joints fractures and weathered zones which produce openings for groundwater recharge flow and storage darko et al 2003 yidana et al 2014 the occurrence and pervasiveness of these secondary structural entities has resulted in the development of the weathered zone aquifers and the fractured zone aquifers these two main aquifer types contain the alluvium very thin and non existent in most places saprolite saprock fractured and fresh bedrocks within which groundwater occur banoeng yakubo et al 2010 aquifers within the weathered zone occur at the base of the saprolite and in the upper parts of the saprock and complement each other in terms of groundwater delivery the weathered zone varies from 0 to 100 m thickest in the forested areas averaging 60 m and thinnest in the arid zones averaging 10 m the fractured zone aquifers on the other hand usually occur at some depth beneath the weathered zone the weathered and fractured zone aquifers are usually discontinuous and limited in area kortatsi 1994 as a result of the complexity of weathering and occurrence of secondary structural entities the hydrogeological properties are highly variable aquifers within the birimian are highly productive in terms of groundwater delivery owing to folding and deep weathering borehole yield varies between 0 7 and 9 0 m3 h with an average of 3 7 m3 h relatively the granites deliver less water as a result of the less weathered conditions and fractures except for the northern parts of the basin where groundwater delivery in the granites is relatively high darko et al 2003 yield within the granites vary from 0 1 to 30 0 m3 h with a mean value of 2 0 m3 h darko et al 2003 observed no correlation between yield and borehole depth in the granites in the densu basin but noted that borehole yield declined beyond 60 m they concluded that drilling beyond 60 m in the granites may not improve the yield aquifers in the granites are generally unconfined to semi confined and yield is controlled by the degree of weathering and continuity of the formation s structures adomako et al 2011a b the togo structural unit along the south eastern border of the basin is highly fractured jointed and folded and the contact zone between it and the voltaian and granites offers highly conducive conditions for high groundwater accumulation groundwater yield in the togo structural unit ranges between 0 6 and 6 0 m3 h with an average of 2 8 m3 h analyses of hydrogeological data from the database of water research institute revealed that borehole depths in the densu basin ranges between 23 0 and 40 0 m in the birimian 9 1 and 103 0 m in the granites and 28 0 and 97 0 m in the togo structural unit similarly the average thicknesses of the weathered zones are between 5 0 and 27 0 m 1 0 and 32 0 m and 3 0 and 36 0 m respectively in the birimian granites and togo structural unit static water levels in the basin on the other hand vary from 0 8 to 16 9 m 0 1 13 5 m and 1 1 17 9 m in the birimian granite and togo structural unit respectively however due to the discontinuous nature of groundwater occurrence in the granites the static water levels may vary widely and not necessarily fall within the stated bounds hydraulic conductivity and permeability of the rock matrix through which groundwater flows determine to a large extent the amount of vertical groundwater recharge rate the hydraulic conductivity field established by yidana et al 2014 through the simulation of a transient groundwater model in the basin ranged between 2 m d in the middle portions of the basin and over 40 m d in some parts of the south the togo series south east of basin have been described as highly folded and jointed creating the unique conditions for groundwater flow and high storage adomako et al 2011a b yidana et al 2014 pumping test analyses in the basin revealed transmissivity for the granites birimian and voltaian to be 0 5 86 8 m2 day 31 8 m2 day and 0 38 m2 day respectively transmissivity values for 24 boreholes in only the granites were obtained the range of 0 5 86 8 m2 day with a mean of 8 9 m2 day showed a fairly heterogeneous hydrogeological environment in the granites which is characteristic of crystalline geologic formations as the only study yidana et al 2014 presents a spatial distribution map of the hydraulic head their study suggest hydraulic heads were highest in the northern parts where the densu river takes its source and rainfall is highest and lowest in the southern parts of the basin fig 4 where rainfall is lowest wrc 2007 groundwater in the basin has therefore been observed to flow in the north south direction alfa 2010 yidana et al 2014 2018 in accordance with the general hydrogeological principle groundwater flows from high elevation to low elevation areas akurugu et al 2019 alfa 2010 further noticed that on the average hydraulic heads in all the geologic formations showed an annual fluctuation of about 2 m between the wet and dry seasons head fluctuation in the birimian supergroup according to alfa 2010 was quite steady and flat relative to that in the granites and togo structural unit which he attributed to the higher water retention capacity of the unsaturated zone of the birimian therefore groundwater in the birimian do not respond quickly to rainfall as compared to the granite and togo structural unit 4 groundwater quantity 4 1 characterisation of groundwater recharge groundwater availability and amount in space and time is determined and influenced largely by the recharge rate which results from a combination of several factors and processes ng et al 2009 indicates that the principal controls on groundwater recharge are the topography soil properties vegetation and meteorological variables such as precipitation temperature wind etc which interrelate to create the unique conditions that result in groundwater recharge an estimation of spatial and temporal variation of groundwater recharge is prerequisite for resourceful management of aquifers particularly where these estimates form the basis for assigning groundwater withdrawal rates yidana et al 2014 akurugu et al 2019 the groundwater studies reviewed in this study estimated groundwater recharge for the densu basin adopting various approaches a water balance analysis for the basin by wrc 2007 based on analysis of weighted rainfall distribution and actual evapotranspiration estimated total rainfall over the basin to 3198 million m3 year 1230 mm year of which approximately 14 ended up as groundwater recharge mean annual rainfall of the southern coastal plains ranged between 800 and 900 mm and approaches 1600 1700 mm in the northern part of the basin where the densu river has its headwaters wrc 2007 similarly to assess rainfall duration and intensity variation and their impact on the availability of water resources in the densu basin alfa et al 2011 used daily rainfall data in a physical based hydrological model to estimate a water balance for the basin their study put recharge rate in the densu basin at approximately 120 mm year in the birimian 153 mm year in the togo and 140 mm year in the granites which represent 8 13 and 12 of the annual rainfall respectively however they speculated that these recharge rates were at the risk of diminishing as a result of the imminent threats from climate change due to a fall in the intensity of rainfall events as forecasted in a report by the environmental protection agency epa 2000 using a transient numerical model yidana et al 2014 estimated comparable recharge rates of 10 12 in 2006 2008 of the annual precipitation recharge is generally regarded one of the most challenging uncertain parameters to adequately estimate in hydrological studies dripps and bradbury 2007 consequently it is recommended to adopt different methods in recharge estimate studies to minimise the uncertainties associated with using a single approach adomako et al 2010 acknowledged the importance of multiple approaches to recharge estimates and the fact that groundwater recharge estimates stemming from field measurements raises questions of spatial and temporal representativeness of the samples scanlon et al 2002 they therefore applied both numerical modelling of the unsaturated water flow and the approximate peak shift methods for recharge estimation they estimated groundwater recharge in the basin to range between 94 and 182 mm year 7 2 13 9 of annual rainfall and 110 250 mm year 8 4 19 1 of annual rainfall using numerical modelling and the approximate peak shift methods respectively based on isotope data their study further revealed that evaporation was an active process below the ground surface reaching a depth of 2 75 m and attenuating beyond that depth adomako et al 2010 the recharge studies in the basin estimate rates in the same order of magnitude table 1 but depart in terms of the spatial distribution of these values whereas yidana et al 2014 suggests the highest recharge rates occur in the central parts of the basin located in the granites and the lowest in the northern part fig 3 alfa et al 2011 suggest the togo structural unit in the southern part fig 4 receive the highest recharge rates the observed spatial variation in recharge rates by these studies arise from the difference in the approaches to recharge estimates and the spatial distribution and representation of point measurements which serve as inputs for these recharge rates as highlighted by dripps and bradbury 2007 fig 5 4 2 groundwater use understanding of the spatial distribution and quantification of groundwater resources in the basin is prerequisite for adequate management of the resource most of the studies in the basin have pointed out that groundwater recharge exceeds net demand from the literature search the hydrological models by alfa 2010 and yidana et al 2014 appear to be the only numerical groundwater flow model in the basin both studies failed to model the lithostratigraphy of the basin which is critical for a proper conceptualisation of the basin similarly a groundwater budget for the basin appears to be significantly missing in the discussions although projections based on groundwater recharge and scenario analysis appear to give a close picture of the water budget of the basin abstraction versus recharge scenario analyses by yidana et al 2014 suggest the aquifer in the basin could not sustain increased abstractions by up to 20 from 2009 to 2024 as heads fall to about 4 m and suggests a safe annual increment of 5 in groundwater abstraction the densu river basin is one of the most populated and exploited basins in ghana a large proportion of water demand in the basin and some western parts of accra is supplied through abstraction and treatment of water from the river at koforidua nsawam new tafo apedwa and akwadum alfa 2010 however groundwater resources contribute significantly to the water needs of the indigenes alfa 2010 estimated over 600 boreholes exist in the basin most of which are fitted with hand pumps for small community abstractions mechanised boreholes exist in a few places where they are used for industrial water supply small town water supply or bottled water production wrc 2007 table 2 presents abstraction estimates from piped and non piped groundwater supply schemes in the densu basin based on field interviews and the water resources commission ghana the wrc 2007 estimate based on abstraction licences and field inspections that groundwater abstractions through piped systems total 3 316 390 m3 year whereas those to rural communities through non piped systems could amount to about 1 400 000 m3 year however there are abstractions in the basin by private homes and commercial bottled sachet water producing companies which the water resources commission estimate at about 1 400 000 m3 year therefore the total groundwater abstracted in the densu basin amounts to approximately 6 million cubic metres per year 4 2 1 scenario analysis the sustainability of groundwater resources in the basin is being assessed using hypothetical scenarios amidst the available information on recharge and abstraction for instance assuming the least estimated recharge rate 94 mm year by adomako et al 2010 as reviewed in this study and given the total area of 2500 km2 of the densu basin would result in 235 000 000 m3 year as recharge however approximately 6 million cubic metres of groundwater is abstracted annually from the basin which represents 2 5 of the assumed recharge rate based on the estimated abstraction and recharge rates there appears to be sufficient water in the basin theoretically for domestic and industrial purposes although it is noteworthy that this is an extrapolation of the estimated recharge rate over the entire basin and as a result some boreholes located in the populous parts of the basin could experience local overexploitations adomako et al 2010 furthermore the assumption that all the groundwater resources in the basin is available for usage may not be entirely accurate since pollution of same resulting from anthropogenic and geogenic sources may render some of it unusable similarly climate change is projected to cause a reduction in available groundwater resources in sub sahara africa ipcc 2019 whereas population growth and urbanisation is expected to place more demand on the resource these factors would definitely cause the fraction of the groundwater recharge that is consumed 2 5 to rise significantly 5 groundwater hydrochemistry hydrochemical studies from wells in the basin suggest that groundwater is generally of acceptable quality for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes tay and kortatsi 2008 except for a few instances where the groundwater was unsuitable for some purpose table 3 in the densu basin and ghana as a whole most boreholes or hand dug wells are usually constructed for domestic and industrial water supply purposes and not for research as a result research studies using these boreholes hand dug wells give an integrated information about the groundwater system and not depth specific information the groundwater in the basin is generally fresh to brackish with electrical conductivity ec ranging between 96 6 and 10 070 µs cm from north to south adomako et al 2011a b observed an average ec of 1288 µs cm which exceeds the who 2017 recommended value of 1000 µs cm for potable water similarly yidana et al 2018 observed that about 50 of the groundwater samples had tds values exceeding 1000 mg l as opposed to the who 2017 recommended value of 500 mg l the increasing trend in dissolved ions from the north to south corroborates the assertions by most studies in the basin adomako et al 2011a alfa 2010 alfa et al 2011 yidana et al 2014 2018 that groundwater flow is from the north to the south see section 3 2 these studies identify the north and south of the basin as recharge and discharge zones respectively during infiltration of precipitation through the rock media down the subsurface it dissolves minerals and carries the dissolved ions along its path as such ec is usually lowest at points of infiltration designated as recharge zones and highest at discharge points thus after it has travelled through the rock media and characteristically dissolved ions along its flow path freeze and cherry 1979 chegbeleh et al 2020 ph on the other hand is slightly acidic to alkaline and ranges between 5 4 and 7 8 fianko et al 2010 adomako et al 2011a yidana et al 2018 this ph range falls within the ph ranges for natural waters 4 5 8 5 freeze and cherry 1979 langmuir 1997 yidana et al 2018 observed that less than 25 of the groundwater in the basin present ph values lower than 6 5 but higher than 6 0 whereas over 75 fell within the recommended who 2017 standard of 6 5 8 5 for potable water na and hco3 are the dominant cation and anion in the groundwater system na appears to be homogeneously distributed except for a few locations especially towards the coast where the values exceed the recommended value of 200 mg l who 2017 and reaching over 1700 mg l the dominance of bicarbonate in the basin suggest the groundwater is relatively fresh except for the southern parts where conditions such as sea water intrusion and a long residence time cause cl prevalence over bicarbonate yidana et al 2018 as such the main water types in the basin include ca mg hco3 na ca hco3 and nacl mixed water types adomako et al 2011a bam et al 2011 yidana et al 2018 these studies suggest groundwater chemistry in the basin is controlled principally by silicate weathering ion exchange sea water intrusion and in some instances contamination from anthropogenic activities table 3 presents a summary of the hydrochemical studies in the basin 5 1 conceptual groundwater flow the groundwater flow regime for the basin has been reconstructed based on review of conceptual flow postulates using hydrochemical data fianko et al 2010 gibrilla et al 2010 adomako et al 2011a b yidana et al 2018 and hydraulic head distribution based on the calibration of groundwater models alfa 2010 yidana et al 2014 groundwater flow in the basins follows the topographic configuration of the terrain according to the general hydrogeologic principles flowing from high to low elevation areas there is a general dominant north south flow direction and some northeast southwest flow patterns as well with intermittent local flow patterns in the central sections of the basin which is generally undefined fig 6 the northern parts of the basin have the highest elevations reaching 700 m and has been noted as the recharge zone in the basin fianko et al 2010 gibrilla et al 2010 yidana et al 2014 groundwater in the north of the basin is characteristically weakly mineralised with tds hardly exceeding 400 mg l and dominated by hco3 gibrilla et al 2010 yidana et al 2018 fig 6 consistent with recharge zones in the flow regime some topographic highs in the eastern and western sections of the basin can also be recognised as recharge zones in the flow regime as water samples in such areas exhibit similar hydrochemical characteristics as those in the north fig 6 the southern part of the basin is characteristically low in elevation towards the gulf of guinea reaching 5 m where the densu river discharges into the sea the groundwater evolves into mainly a na cl water type in such areas which is characterised by high mineralisation with tds reaching 2000 mg l towards the coast yidana et al 2018 noted that groundwater in discharge areas in the densu basin in the flow regime had the highest levels of hydrochemical parameters and were located in the lowest elevations mixed water types dominated by na hco3 mg hco3 ca na hco3 na ca hco3 etc are notably present in the intermediate flow zones occurs between the recharge and discharge zones generally tds in the densu basin appears relatively low which has been attributed to the slow decompositions of crystalline rocks of the birimian supergroup and granitoids of the eburnean and tamnean plutonic suites which underlie about 90 of the area 6 primary groundwater and environmental problems the densu basin is characterised by accelerating environmental degradation water resources in the basin are increasingly diminishing in quantity and quality as a result of increasing population climate change urbanisation and expanded use of the resource for irrigation fisheries industrial activities ecosystem services etc wrc 2007 ghana national water policy document 2007 the traditional bush fallowing system of farming accompanied by slash and burn contributes significantly to deforestation similarly mining activities in the birimian formation around the east akim district sand winning stone quarrying and illegal fishing methods such as the use of explosives and chemicals contribute to the diminishing water quantity and quality problems in the basin wrc 2007 several other studies have mentioned indiscriminate waste disposal in the basin as a source of worry for the environment and a major factor in the pollution of both surface and groundwater bodies wrc 2007 fianko et al 2010 adomako et al 2011a yidana et al 2018 waste discharge to surface water bodies especially rivers has been predicted to increase by up to 10 times the presents amount wrc 2007 increasing urbanisation population growth and industrialisation occur with attendant increasing thinning of the forest with climate change implications average temperatures in ghana have reportedly increased by 1 c from 1960 to 2000 and are projected to rise between 1 7 and 2 04 c over the next 20 years simulations of historical climate data suggest 10 20 change in rainfall and a reduction in runoffs of 15 20 over the coming 20 year period wrc 2007 climate change scenarios also revealed a reduction in groundwater recharge at a rate of 5 10 during the same period water resources have been predicted to be at the centre of the impacts of climate change by extensive studies which adopted two of the most important drivers of the hydrological cycle temperature and rainfall for such analyses kusangaya et al 2014 nkhonjera 2017 asare nuamah and botchway 2019 the ipcc 2019 holds that potential impacts of climate change on water resources is expected to increase in magnitude diversity and severity if the observed climate change in the last 100 years persist into the future it further projects a reduction in soil moisture and runoff where major river basins show a decreasing trend in runoff of up to 17 in arid and semiarid regions in africa 7 conclusions and recommendations groundwater has always been crucial in the delivery of the water demands of rural communities and small towns in ghana it is gradually gaining similar attention in the big cities mainly due to the diminishing trend in the quantity and quality of surface water bodies in the country this review sought to assess groundwater resources in the densu basin with focus on hydrogeological properties hydrochemical characteristics general quality and quantity challenges and the projections thereof the review revealed that groundwater in the basin flows in the north south direction with the hydraulic head fluctuation of about 2 m between the wet and dry seasons generally there is inadequate lack of literature on hydraulic characteristics such as hydraulic conductivity transmissivity porosity yield etc and general lithostratigraphy description of aquifers and the basin for proper understanding of the general hydrogeology of the basin groundwater recharge in the densu basin was observed to far exceed the reported abstraction rate which implies that the resource has potential to be expanded for other uses such as irrigation agriculture although the recharge rate may be at the risk of diminishing in the future as a result of climate change impacts on the rainfall events quality studies showed that groundwater in the basin is generally of acceptable quality for various purposes except for instances where contamination as a result of domestic waste discharge mining and agricultural activities render the groundwater unsuitable especially where significant levels of nitrates iron chloride sulphate etc were detected the hydrochemistry of the basin is controlled principally by silicate weathering ion exchange and sea water intrusion challenges such as rising water demands impacts of climate change on groundwater resources anthropogenic effects on groundwater quality and inadequate knowledge of the underlying aquifers require much attention hence it is recommended that an integrated hydrogeological assessment of the basin is conducted in a holistic manner in a bid to adequately understand the aquifers and groundwater resources in the basin for informed water management decisions

8019,study region this study is conducted over the notwane catchment area nca in southeastern botswana using geospatial and geophysical tools study focus geospatial and geophysical tools which provide spatial information for both the surface and subsurface have been widely used in groundwater exploration because of their capability in detecting physical properties that are related to groundwater phenomena in this research relevant remotely sensed data including aeromagnetic data and satellite images were used to identify potential groundwater recharge zones within the nca as a contribution towards improved water resources management amid the changing climate the multi disciplinary approach used could offer a more reliable way to identify potential recharge zones particularly in semi arid hard rock terrains new hydrological insights for the region assessment of groundwater recharge potential looking at remotely sensed data revealed that built up areas expanded significantly between 2009 and 2019 with implications for run off and flooding through aeromagnetic data interpretation of euler deconvolution solutions and apparent susceptibility computations weathered zones and geologic lineaments mainly dykes and faults indicating areas with increased secondary porosity were identified consequently the groundwater recharge optimization model was used to determine areas with higher recharge potential which lie on the central part of the nca northeastern margin and the southernmost part bounded by topographical relief of hills with thick vegetation these areas are characterized by approximately 200 m depth of weathering and predominantly east west structural features keywords apparent susceptibility euler deconvolution solution groundwater recharge potential notwane catchment area nca remote sensing geospatial tools 1 introduction groundwater recharge has been ordinarily through natural means and with the rise in discharge through boreholes and water wells there has been increased use of artificial recharge techniques crafted to augment groundwater recharge these techniques involve the development of models that seek to identify potential areas where groundwater recharge can be considered to harness surface runoffs during the short and often unpredictable rainy seasons harvested surface runoff can be directed to potential recharge zones and if need be other alternatives of artificial groundwater recharge like pumping wells can benefit from the temporary stored rainwater it is expected that artificial recharge will become a very critical component of water resources management and planning as population growth and increased per capita consumption into the future requires water kumari and krishna 2013 artificial recharge of groundwater is a practical option that makes the best use of unused water resources in replenishing aquifers hammouri et al 2014 this will undoubtedly relieve the increased pressure on groundwater resources which is often anchored on more technological developments in groundwater exploration which increases the rate of discharge more than the resource can recover however if not well planned structures made along drainage system to harvest surface runoff and storm water do not benefit downstream water sources as most of the water is arrested until local areas are saturated to the detriment of downstream users as highlighted by chanda et al 2018 this scenario occurred in the notwane catchment where debates pointed to small upstream dams as partly responsible for the gaborone dam s failure by late 2015 until cyclone dineo s downpours filled the dam to full capacity in the 2016 2017 rain season the notwane catchment area nca which is the study area covers about 9260 km2 and hosts the largest population cluster in botswana that has the highest demand of portable water and a significant number of groundwater boreholes fig 1 in the current setting the greater gaborone area usually experiences flooding which results in storm water being viewed as nuisance because of its urbanizing landscape challenges of lack of management of storm water and excessive abstraction of groundwater often lead to impairment of fragile aquifers this research therefore aims to identify suitable sites within the nca where excess runoff can be used to restore drawn groundwater to lessen aquifer impairment artificial recharge of groundwater as a practical option makes best use of unused water resources in replenishing aquifers hammouri et al 2014 the conceptual framework guiding this research is aimed at maintaining sustainable groundwater resources through monitoring and data collection of groundwater levels determining environmental groundwater depth implementing groundwater resources management through recharge and the feedback and adjustment processes the following diagram in fig 2 shows an adopted and modified conceptual framework of environmental groundwater depth and sustainable groundwater resources management from huang et al 2019 and da costa et al 2019 respectively the induvial frameworks were adapted and incorporated in this study because of the interlinkages of the spatially distributed recharge processes and groundwater levels which are significantly affected by the ever increasing number of boreholes drilled borehole monitoring stations within the catchment provide temporal data of groundwater water levels tafila 2020 analyzed for visible trends where recharge discharge and balanced groundwater depths against rainfall amounts were inferred for rising declining and sustainable use of groundwater rates respectively the environmental groundwater depth phase is established from groundwater level response obtained from monitoring data the pressure exerted on the aquifer determines if the water table is lowered by excessive water abstraction or rising due to natural or artificial recharge where rainfall is the source of groundwater recharge the implementation of water resources management step informs actions and policies to be implemented when abstracting groundwater whilst achieving sustainable use of the resource the human population groundwater boreholes and activities in the area determine the amount of water used balancing between the rate of discharge and recharge to optimize resource use is for sustainability and the ultimate aim of water resources management in this regard employing groundwater recharge techniques through the use of gis and spatial analysis in identifying potential recharge zones is critical to the maintenance of optimum groundwater levels the major source of groundwater recharge is precipitation through natural recharge and induced recharge techniques which are accurately positioned in a zoned map of potential recharge different thematic layers overlaid in a gis environment will determine suitability of individual sites derived from geospatial data the final phase in the multi step framework of maintaining sustainable groundwater resources ensures that the target of sustainable groundwater resources is achieved through adjustments in recharge and abstraction rates 2 geology and hydrophysical setting of the nca the nca is mostly covered by the gaborone granite and the waterberg supergroup with spatial extents indicated on the geology map fig 3 kanye volcanics represents a series of highest topographic relief zones of the area the study area has highest elevations on the southwestern side reaching 1496 m while the surface discharge point is to the northeastern side and has the lowest elevation of about 918 m the catchment outlet at the discharge point is a convergence of river systems passing through the city of gaborone and its immediate environments this geographical region is characterized by highly variable and scarce rainfall summer rainfall over the area comes between october and march averaging around 500 mm per annum annual evapotranspiration which exceeds annual rainfall peaks between the months of january and april during the rainy season moalafhi et al 2018 temperatures can reach maximums of 40 0c during summer with winter temperatures going as low as 7 0c availability of groundwater in the area s hard rock terrains is limited with occurrences only confined to fractured and weathered zones which provide secondary porosity dijon 1984 observed that precambrian rocks have fracture zones associated with faults and weathering along the strike to form deep basin as cited by botha and van rooy 2001 these weathered zones correspond with low topographic elevations and drainage systems the topographic lows subsequently serve as water recharge zones because surface water that has accumulated in the depressions percolate into the subsurface with the aid of gravity and suitable ground transmissivity chuma et al 2020 have also observed that geological setting greatly influences existence of crystalline basement aquifers in a similar study conducted in bulawayo zimbabwe 3 methodology and data an integrated approach of using geospatial and geophysical techniques in this study is that satellite imagery interpreted with the respective subsurface physical properties from geophysical data offers a unique perspective of surface and groundwater availability and interactions satellite images are currently being used to identify ground features that are presumed to be direct and indirect indicators of groundwater potential rashid et al 2012 while geophysical methods are used to remotely gather the subsurface properties of the underlying geology roy 2014 aeromagnetic data was processed and interpreted with the goal of mapping geological structures and weathered zones within the notwane catchment on the other end satellite images were used to assess the surface for land cover land use as well as river networks and drainage system in the catchment 3 1 aeromagnetic data processing and interpretation the use of certain geophysical methods is determined by the objective of the research the investigation of the subsurface is made relevant to geological structures that aid in the capacity to store and recharge the groundwater sources with surface runoff ideally lineaments including dykes and faults which form secondary porosity to store water and are conduits to groundwater flow are best investigated from aeromagnetic data processing as discussed below 3 2 euler deconvolution and apparent susceptibility aeromagnetic data is the data obtained remotely from aircraft and bears the magnetic strength of the rocks over the survey area the total field as discussed by dentith and mudge 2014 is usually referred to as the total magnetic intensity tmi which is usually the resultant of a vector sum of the vertical and the two horizontal components x y z of the field and measured in nanotesla an igrf international geomagnetic reference field corrected archive aeromagnetic data used for this research was obtained from the botswana geoscience institute this data was acquired between 1986 by geosurvey international gmbh using scintrex cesium vapour magnetometer of 0 01 nt sensitivity flight lines were 1 km apart at mean terrain clearance of 150 m data preparation for this exercise included windowing aeromagnetic grid sufficiently covering the study area from the recompiled nationwide magnetic data the data bears an enhanced 50 m resolution magnetic grids released by the then department of geological survey in 2012 following a nationwide tie line survey of airborne magnetics in 2010 2011 reford et al 2013 the interpretation of the aeromagnetic data was done with the aim of determining the orientation and spatial extent of lineaments found in the nca because they play a major role in the flow of groundwater the initial process of analyzing aeromagnetic data included the reduction to pole which was done in order to reduce the effect of magnetic inclination which has an advantage of improving interpretation of the map by centering the anomalies directly above their sources detail enhancement filters were also applied to the aeromagnetic data to emphasize the edges of linear features in the tmi grid and outline zones of weathering from calculating magnetic susceptibility depth of weathering is important for water percolation the output of processing aeromagnetic data is the production of lineament density map which was used to validate the structural lineaments obtained from processing satellite images of the area takorabt et al 2018 have also confirmed the presence of structural lineaments of landsat 7 etm satellite images using geophysical results and geological map geological lineaments of shallower to a few hundred meters of depth are of importance to groundwater dynamics which sustains the lives of humans and vegetation by providing fresh water the depth to sources and locations of magnetic sources where lineaments were derived from anomaly gradients were computed using the euler deconvolution technique the euler s equation adapted by reid et al 1990 is given by 1 x x o f x y y o f y z z o f z n b f which represents the strength f of a potential field in this case magnetic at a point x y z in space due to a source located at xo yo zo in terms of the first order derivatives f x f y and f z regional background component b and the structural index n the structural index that was used in this objective was one 1 which is targeted at the rate at which the field f falls off with distance for approximately linear features such as faults dykes and sills reid et al 1990 which encourage secondary porosity in hard rock terrains roy 2014 several indices have been derived for other source types as discussed by dentith and mudge 2014 a 50 m square window was used as the depth estimation procedure relies on the field curvature within the data window used and the minimum depths returned are about the same as the grid interval while the maximum depths are about twice the window size reid et al 1990 solutions with a depth tolerance greater than 5 were discarded in addition to aeromagnetic data processing apparent susceptibility k calculation yields measurable estimates of the relationship between magnetic flux density b and magnetizing force h this relationship is given by 2 b kh apparent susceptibility is an inversion technique that was used to convert the magnetic field strength into an apparent physical property map by applying a compound filter the physical property map approximates true susceptibilities and gives an indication of the local geology silva and hohmann 1984 the susceptibility filter comprises of reduction to the pole downward continuation to the source depth correction of the geometric effect of a vertical square ended prism and division by the total magnetic field to yield susceptibility grant 1973 the apparent susceptibility of the prism as presented by yunsheng et al 1985 is given by the relation 3 t u v 2 π t o m u v h u v s u v k j d j x y u v where to is the earth s magnetic field intensity m u v h u v s u v dj x y u v are magnetization depth size displacement factors respectively k being the susceptibility u v representing wavenumbers in x y direction and j denoting the prism index in a grid of n prisms the size and magnetization factors are the same for all prisms while reduction to the pole and downward continuation removes the displacement and depth factors respectively rocks highly concentrated with ferro and or ferrimagnetic minerals tend to have high susceptibilities acidic igneous and metamorphic rocks having average to low susceptibilities while sedimentary rocks have generally low susceptibilities reynolds 2011 apparent susceptibility of the aeromagnetic grid of the study area was calculated to determine the degree of geologic alteration in the study area which is also affected by groundwater presence ranganai and ebinger 2008 have acknowledged the use of apparent susceptibility maps in identifying areas with potential for deep weathering alteration zones or thick permeable regolith 3 3 satellite imagery remote sensing the significance of satellite data is that they provide invaluable information on the surface properties of the ground which affects the hydrological process of the area enhancement of satellite imagery comes handy when interpreted for lineament mapping land use land cover and dems digital elevation models for extracting drainage patterns of an area 3 4 land use land cover mapping land covers in an area can create an impervious layer which alters the hydrology of the area causing flooding or allowing surface waters to percolate into the subsurface dependent on the transmissivity of the ground the infiltration rate which is also affected by different land covers controls surface water flow and with impervious surfaces excess water begins to accumulate as surface storage in small depressions governed by surface topography which could potentially recharge groundwater sources by percolation or lost through evaporation the significance of land cover mapping helped in demarcating the general areas which are semi impervious like built up areas and portions that bear the natural landscape of the area the land cover classification of the study area was carried out through supervised image classification of 2009 landsat 7 etm and 2019 landsat 8 oli tirs images covering the study area for the rows and paths indicated in table 1 these satellite images were chosen considering the spatial resolution of 30 m which improved the output of land cover classes with a higher resolution the changes in land cover between 2009 and 2019 were expected to be significant in creating imperviousness and or altering runoff generation with implications for ground water recharge a total of 6 major land cover land use classes were identified in the study area by virtual interpretation which were considered for image classification a standard false colour of 5 4 3 representing blue green and red respectively for landsat 8 oli tirs and 4 3 2 for landsat 7 etm enhanced the images for assessing the classes of land covers in fig 4 these classes are described in table 2 a ground truthing follow up was carried out at designated points generated through systematic sampling to ensure that all land cover classes are checked to evaluate the performance of the classification algorithm this process is referred to as accuracy assessment congalton and green 2008 outlined the importance of knowing the accuracy of a map produced as effective decisions about the extent and distribution of resources lies on accurate maps or at least maps of known accuracy 3 5 lineament mapping lineaments are classified as either edges or lines on a digital grey scale image farahbakhsh et al 2018 the exercise of lineament mapping is a systematic process that involves satellite image processing techniques to extract linear features which are surface expressions of the local geology of an area the main advantage of lineament detection to this study is that geological lineaments dykes faults fractures surface discontinuities cleavages river reaches are an integral part which largely controls groundwater flow however yeh et al 2016 noted that this approach of lineament detection in satellite imagery is capable of detecting non geologic features like paths roads that can be misinterpreted from satellite images and subsequently causing errors in the analysis of lineaments hence the need for validation using geophysical methods which have the advantage to remotely image the subsurface zeil et al 1991 also emphasized the need for an integrated approach using aeromagnetic data as prevalent cover can considerably conceal detection of lineaments from satellite imagery ranganai and ebinger 2008 further add that aeromagnetic data investigates deeper lineaments than remote sensing river reaches were detected through a series of networking lineaments following riparian vegetation and low elevations for drainage characterization non geologic lineaments helped in demarcating built up areas from other land classes which are characteristics possessed by this class over other land covers 3 6 dem and drainage networks digital terrain model is a three dimensional surface of the terrain that is packed with digital information where a variety of hydrological and terrain characteristics of an area can be extracted saraf et al 2004 digital terrain modelling was performed for this research to derive the slope aspect flow accumulation and stream networks within the notwane catchment these terrain properties provide invaluable information about the study area where the core objective is the understanding of water flow dynamics from the surface into the subsurface saraf et al 2004 further elaborates on the derivatives of dem not just being a spatial distribution of elevation with reference to an arbitrary datum but other variables like groundwater levels chemical qualities of water can be also represented the dem for the area was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm 3 7 groundwater recharge optimization gis weighted overlay analysis the data collected for the study area and ancillary data from document study was integrated in a gis environment to produce a groundwater potential recharge site map for the area this integration draws optimum synergy of geophysical data and other remotely sensed data the different thematic maps derived from the discussed methodologies were assigned relative weights and rankings according to their suitability in aiding groundwater recharge using analytic hierarchy process ahp approach the thematic maps for the area constituted spatial data consisting of lineament density map slope elevation land use land cover drainage network flow accumulation apparent magnetic susceptibility and soil types weighting criteria developed by saaty and vargas 2012 for assigning weights to the variables used in this process is shown in table 3 this weighting criteria simply ranks a variable against another according to the objective and desired output in which case for this study variables were compared on their importance to aiding groundwater recharge saaty and vargas 2012 s pairwise comparison scale was used to determine the relevance of the variables e g lineaments in first row in table 4 to other variables column 2 8 to determine the weight of each variable in the last column in this example when lineaments are compared to lineaments the judgment yields an equally important result but when compared to land cover lineaments are extremely important the overall weight assigned to each variable was dependent on individual comparison of lineaments to the other six variables this step was repeated for the other 6 variables the steps involved in calculating the weights entailed summing up the columns to generate a scaled influence measure which was later used to normalize the matrix as discussed by mu and pereyra rojas 2017 occurrence of inconsistencies in judgments is resolved in the ahp process and it provides means of improving consistency saaty and vargas 2012 the analytic hierarchy process was used to analyze data for groundwater recharge potential over the catchment in which the variables were scaled and weighted based on literature and best judgment maxwell 2018 soil types and land cover classes which were part of the inputs in modelling groundwater optimization datasets were assigned discrete values according to their relative influence on groundwater recharge since their data is not continuous for soil types these scales were based on field soil moisture capacity fsmc of different soils within the study area which correspond to their clay content whereas land cover was based on the level of permeability of different classes other data sets which were continuous were scaled from 0 to 1 indicating low to high respectively and this included elevation slope apparent susceptibility lineament density and flow accumulation in which the last two were converted to continuous data by calculating the euclidean distance from the features these variables affect groundwater recharge and discharge the drainage patterns and amount of rainfall within the study area are also critical to groundwater recharge 4 results and discussions 4 1 euler deconvolution and magnetic susceptibility processing of archive aeromagnetic data with fitting algorithms discussed in the methodology chapter to draw inferences on major regional features of groundwater importance yielded lineament and standard euler deconvolution solution maps figs 5 and 6 respectively predominant structures and their trends show that the area has geologic lineaments with varying orientations on areas which were gridded during data collection lineaments present secondary porosity which controls ground water flow by either creating barriers dykes or path faults most of the lineaments drawn from standard euler solutions are in shallow depth range of 0 100 m fig 7 which play a significant role on groundwater flow that is easily accessible for abstraction ranganai and ebinger 2008 also acknowledged the same fact about lineaments bearing considerable depth likely to be open groundwater conduits hard rock terrains as is the case with the local geology fresh granites within nca presents limited groundwater availability as compared to weathered and fractured subsurface the vertical derivative map fig 5 shows enhanced lineaments and edges of magnetic bodies the faded portion on the greater gaborone area is a result of no data recorded in the area and covered by interpolated values at a larger cell size the cell size for the grids used here was 50 m and a projected coordinate system of utm zone 35 part of the muted area shown in the map in fig 5 were not surveyed due to restricted activities and security reasons for military airbase which lies on the western part of the study area the standard euler solutions plotted here were categorized on depth ranges of 0 100 100 200 and depths of more than 200 m a 10 tolerance of solutions was set in order to generate more reliable solutions which were later filtered based on dxy x offset and y offset which yielded fewer solutions lineaments in the notwane have varying orientations length as well as depths majority of the lineaments are shallower whereas deeper ones show similar orientation and slightly varying lengths at the same ground locations the area surrounding the greater gaborone do not show lineaments as there was no data for computing the euler deconvolution in the area the apparent susceptibility map shows distinct apparent susceptibilities where areas at higher elevations fig 10 a corresponds with high apparent susceptibilities the central part of the catchment has average apparent susceptibilities compared to elevated areas and those exhibiting lower apparent susceptibilities magnetic susceptibilities have a geological significance on the degree of alteration of rocks due to groundwater presence there is higher apparent susceptibility range in the general notwane catchment which provides a varied option to suitable sites for groundwater recharge based on the apparent susceptibilities calculated southern parts of the catchment and an area near mochudi have high apparent susceptibilities which could be inferred to be strongly magnetized rocks whereas other areas have low apparent susceptibilities of 0 00092 that could be associated with deeply weathered oxidized igneous and metamorphic rocks and rarely non magnetized sediments since the notwane area overlays a crystalline basement the advantage of having both these extreme susceptibilities is that weaker apparent susceptibilities present a fitting environment for groundwater recharge while formations with high apparent susceptibilities would bound and control groundwater flow from escaping the point of recharge other areas fall within the average spectrum of apparent susceptibility the greater gaborone area shows noisy streaks on this spectrum which is a result of data unavailability 4 2 satellite image processing 4 2 1 land cover the map in fig 9 shows six major classes of land use land cover found in the study area for two years 2009 2019 the change in land cover between this period is summarized in table 5 which shows gains and losses of different classes error matrix and accuracy assessment results of 2019 land cover map are also shown in succeeding table 6 precipitation is the source of water that feeds both surface and groundwater sources where landcover is the primary filter of surface water that seeps and flow through the drainage system of the area the six major landcovers identified in the area have different impacts on the dynamics of percolation the overall accuracy assessment of the 2019 image was 75 5 this area is mostly covered in vegetation of varying densities and the natural landscape has been preserved for more than 96 of the total notwane area as of 2019 thick hilly vegetation which is indicative of abrupt topographic change mostly influences the surface flow of runoff or barrier to storm water or floods this area covers about 15 of the area and resembles geologic structures that coincide with high subsurface and outcropping rocks of high magnetic strength these structures are observed on the southernmost part of the study area with north west south east trend and also with a west east trend in the upper part of notwane catchment the built up area has expanded significantly between 2009 and 2019 resulting in an impervious land cover which has disturbed normal percolation of surface water and causing localized flooding in towns flooding in such areas is controlled by drainage system which drains storm water into the natural system the amount of surface water as seen in table 5 and fig 9 has reduced slightly during this period which could be attributed to abstraction to meet water demands in the area in summary land cover changes which did not impact the permeability of the surface are vegetation classes which only changed due to varying rainfall and other weather conditions 4 2 2 dem the following image assortments fig 10 were processed from srtm data to generate drainage patterns for the notwane catchment which govern the dynamics of surface runoff generated from the catchment the drainage system of the study area is incomplete due to administrative boundary between botswana and south africa and as a result limiting the study area to the botswana side there is a great influence of flow accumulation as some river channels flow from the neighboring country the affected area here lies on the southeastern part of the study area along lobatse and ramotswa where there is a transboundary aquifer shared by the countries the notwane catchment area has a varying topographic relief with higher elevations bounding the area on the western side the change in elevation is mostly gentle on the eastern side of the area which is mostly covered by ground sloping less than 2 degrees this is suitable ground for allowing natural percolation of rainwater without discharging most of the surface as runoff 4 3 groundwater optimization the following fig 11 is the output of the weighted overlay technique weights of the variables in table 4 used in modelling potential groundwater recharge sites shown in fig 11 were key inputs in the ahp tool and the output was categorized in classes of four different recharge potentials being poor minimal moderate and strong zones the infeasible areas with empty output for groundwater recharge potential which have not been categorized are indicated by flow direction of surface runoff on the right map in fig 11 below these are areas dominated by impervious surfaces built up area steep slopes soils with higher clay content high fsmc and higher apparent susceptibilities these impervious and semi impervious surfaces generate runoffs and prevent infiltration of rainwater which is collected through storm water drainage system which are sometimes overloaded causing floods thus providing source of water to recharge groundwater sources geological lineaments outside the built up areas are fundamental structures that affect groundwater movement as they are conduits to groundwater flow which leads to aquifers the slope and topography of the area affect direction of surface water flow by gravity and careful assessment of the area including the type of lithology play a vital role in determining the suitable areas that can be proposed to be ideal groundwater recharge zones the catchment has a total of 20 watersheds in which four are shared between botswana and south africa as shown in fig 11 groundwater recharge optimization draws individual aspects discussed in the methodology into an ideal recharge system where excess surface runoff generated from surplus water flooding is stored underground to be used during water shortage based on findings from a research conducted by tafila 2020 on the notwane catchment there is evident trend of declining groundwater levels across the whole catchment on the same study runoffs were seen to have increased significantly between the years 2009 and 2019 despite the modelled runoff only considering contribution of climatic variables to the exclusion of land cover and land use changes investigation of surface and subsurface of the catchment yielded input data for groundwater optimization model the use of continuous and discrete raster datasets yielded output of different categories of recharge potential the main strengths of the model were on variables with more influence in groundwater dynamics and these included spatial extents with high lineament densities and low apparent susceptibilities which are indicative of secondary porosities in a similar study chuma and hlatywayo 2013 has indicated that zones of increased porosity and permeability were proximal to lineaments which greatly increases the chance of groundwater accumulation empty output is an infeasible site due to unfavorable land use e g built up or rather a complex nature of the subsurface which has little relevance to groundwater sources like areas with high magnetic susceptibilities shown in fig 8 areas with higher recharge potential lies on the central part of the catchment northeastern margin and the southernmost part bounded by topographical relief of hills with thick vegetation the unclassified areas on the model output mainly comprise of built up areas and areas with high magnetic susceptibilities these areas are likely to generate increased runoff due to limited infiltration of storm water which will be redirected to watershed outlet points through areas of high flow accumulation and ultimately main river systems 5 conclusion significant geological lineaments and land covers of the notwane catchment were generated and analyzed for potential groundwater recharge most lineaments generated were shallower with general east west direction whilst a few were more than 200 m deep these lineaments combined with complex land cover of pervious and impervious surfaces provide limited potential conduits of groundwater flow within the catchment the varied groundwater potential within the notwane catchment is due to non uniform distribution of theses lineaments and varied magnetic susceptibilities which are measures of intensity of weathering it can be inferred that poor groundwater recharge potential areas are furthest from lineaments and low magnetic susceptibility zones areas with low elevations and high flow accumulation are potential sites for capturing runoff in detention ponds and check dams at suitable watershed outlet points while areas with high elevations are less weathered and do not allow surface water to percolate without flowing to low flat area the magnetic susceptibility map indicates that areas with high elevation have relatively high magnetic susceptibility high magnetic susceptibility zones are presumably less weathered and lack secondary porosity for effortless groundwater recharge groundwater recharge optimization encompassing ahp shows that areas with higher recharge potential lie on the central part of the nca northeastern margin and the southernmost part bounded by topographical relief of hills with thick vegetation though not tested by ground follow up methods the multi disciplinary approach used could offer a more reliable way to identify potential recharge zones particularly in

8019,study region this study is conducted over the notwane catchment area nca in southeastern botswana using geospatial and geophysical tools study focus geospatial and geophysical tools which provide spatial information for both the surface and subsurface have been widely used in groundwater exploration because of their capability in detecting physical properties that are related to groundwater phenomena in this research relevant remotely sensed data including aeromagnetic data and satellite images were used to identify potential groundwater recharge zones within the nca as a contribution towards improved water resources management amid the changing climate the multi disciplinary approach used could offer a more reliable way to identify potential recharge zones particularly in semi arid hard rock terrains new hydrological insights for the region assessment of groundwater recharge potential looking at remotely sensed data revealed that built up areas expanded significantly between 2009 and 2019 with implications for run off and flooding through aeromagnetic data interpretation of euler deconvolution solutions and apparent susceptibility computations weathered zones and geologic lineaments mainly dykes and faults indicating areas with increased secondary porosity were identified consequently the groundwater recharge optimization model was used to determine areas with higher recharge potential which lie on the central part of the nca northeastern margin and the southernmost part bounded by topographical relief of hills with thick vegetation these areas are characterized by approximately 200 m depth of weathering and predominantly east west structural features keywords apparent susceptibility euler deconvolution solution groundwater recharge potential notwane catchment area nca remote sensing geospatial tools 1 introduction groundwater recharge has been ordinarily through natural means and with the rise in discharge through boreholes and water wells there has been increased use of artificial recharge techniques crafted to augment groundwater recharge these techniques involve the development of models that seek to identify potential areas where groundwater recharge can be considered to harness surface runoffs during the short and often unpredictable rainy seasons harvested surface runoff can be directed to potential recharge zones and if need be other alternatives of artificial groundwater recharge like pumping wells can benefit from the temporary stored rainwater it is expected that artificial recharge will become a very critical component of water resources management and planning as population growth and increased per capita consumption into the future requires water kumari and krishna 2013 artificial recharge of groundwater is a practical option that makes the best use of unused water resources in replenishing aquifers hammouri et al 2014 this will undoubtedly relieve the increased pressure on groundwater resources which is often anchored on more technological developments in groundwater exploration which increases the rate of discharge more than the resource can recover however if not well planned structures made along drainage system to harvest surface runoff and storm water do not benefit downstream water sources as most of the water is arrested until local areas are saturated to the detriment of downstream users as highlighted by chanda et al 2018 this scenario occurred in the notwane catchment where debates pointed to small upstream dams as partly responsible for the gaborone dam s failure by late 2015 until cyclone dineo s downpours filled the dam to full capacity in the 2016 2017 rain season the notwane catchment area nca which is the study area covers about 9260 km2 and hosts the largest population cluster in botswana that has the highest demand of portable water and a significant number of groundwater boreholes fig 1 in the current setting the greater gaborone area usually experiences flooding which results in storm water being viewed as nuisance because of its urbanizing landscape challenges of lack of management of storm water and excessive abstraction of groundwater often lead to impairment of fragile aquifers this research therefore aims to identify suitable sites within the nca where excess runoff can be used to restore drawn groundwater to lessen aquifer impairment artificial recharge of groundwater as a practical option makes best use of unused water resources in replenishing aquifers hammouri et al 2014 the conceptual framework guiding this research is aimed at maintaining sustainable groundwater resources through monitoring and data collection of groundwater levels determining environmental groundwater depth implementing groundwater resources management through recharge and the feedback and adjustment processes the following diagram in fig 2 shows an adopted and modified conceptual framework of environmental groundwater depth and sustainable groundwater resources management from huang et al 2019 and da costa et al 2019 respectively the induvial frameworks were adapted and incorporated in this study because of the interlinkages of the spatially distributed recharge processes and groundwater levels which are significantly affected by the ever increasing number of boreholes drilled borehole monitoring stations within the catchment provide temporal data of groundwater water levels tafila 2020 analyzed for visible trends where recharge discharge and balanced groundwater depths against rainfall amounts were inferred for rising declining and sustainable use of groundwater rates respectively the environmental groundwater depth phase is established from groundwater level response obtained from monitoring data the pressure exerted on the aquifer determines if the water table is lowered by excessive water abstraction or rising due to natural or artificial recharge where rainfall is the source of groundwater recharge the implementation of water resources management step informs actions and policies to be implemented when abstracting groundwater whilst achieving sustainable use of the resource the human population groundwater boreholes and activities in the area determine the amount of water used balancing between the rate of discharge and recharge to optimize resource use is for sustainability and the ultimate aim of water resources management in this regard employing groundwater recharge techniques through the use of gis and spatial analysis in identifying potential recharge zones is critical to the maintenance of optimum groundwater levels the major source of groundwater recharge is precipitation through natural recharge and induced recharge techniques which are accurately positioned in a zoned map of potential recharge different thematic layers overlaid in a gis environment will determine suitability of individual sites derived from geospatial data the final phase in the multi step framework of maintaining sustainable groundwater resources ensures that the target of sustainable groundwater resources is achieved through adjustments in recharge and abstraction rates 2 geology and hydrophysical setting of the nca the nca is mostly covered by the gaborone granite and the waterberg supergroup with spatial extents indicated on the geology map fig 3 kanye volcanics represents a series of highest topographic relief zones of the area the study area has highest elevations on the southwestern side reaching 1496 m while the surface discharge point is to the northeastern side and has the lowest elevation of about 918 m the catchment outlet at the discharge point is a convergence of river systems passing through the city of gaborone and its immediate environments this geographical region is characterized by highly variable and scarce rainfall summer rainfall over the area comes between october and march averaging around 500 mm per annum annual evapotranspiration which exceeds annual rainfall peaks between the months of january and april during the rainy season moalafhi et al 2018 temperatures can reach maximums of 40 0c during summer with winter temperatures going as low as 7 0c availability of groundwater in the area s hard rock terrains is limited with occurrences only confined to fractured and weathered zones which provide secondary porosity dijon 1984 observed that precambrian rocks have fracture zones associated with faults and weathering along the strike to form deep basin as cited by botha and van rooy 2001 these weathered zones correspond with low topographic elevations and drainage systems the topographic lows subsequently serve as water recharge zones because surface water that has accumulated in the depressions percolate into the subsurface with the aid of gravity and suitable ground transmissivity chuma et al 2020 have also observed that geological setting greatly influences existence of crystalline basement aquifers in a similar study conducted in bulawayo zimbabwe 3 methodology and data an integrated approach of using geospatial and geophysical techniques in this study is that satellite imagery interpreted with the respective subsurface physical properties from geophysical data offers a unique perspective of surface and groundwater availability and interactions satellite images are currently being used to identify ground features that are presumed to be direct and indirect indicators of groundwater potential rashid et al 2012 while geophysical methods are used to remotely gather the subsurface properties of the underlying geology roy 2014 aeromagnetic data was processed and interpreted with the goal of mapping geological structures and weathered zones within the notwane catchment on the other end satellite images were used to assess the surface for land cover land use as well as river networks and drainage system in the catchment 3 1 aeromagnetic data processing and interpretation the use of certain geophysical methods is determined by the objective of the research the investigation of the subsurface is made relevant to geological structures that aid in the capacity to store and recharge the groundwater sources with surface runoff ideally lineaments including dykes and faults which form secondary porosity to store water and are conduits to groundwater flow are best investigated from aeromagnetic data processing as discussed below 3 2 euler deconvolution and apparent susceptibility aeromagnetic data is the data obtained remotely from aircraft and bears the magnetic strength of the rocks over the survey area the total field as discussed by dentith and mudge 2014 is usually referred to as the total magnetic intensity tmi which is usually the resultant of a vector sum of the vertical and the two horizontal components x y z of the field and measured in nanotesla an igrf international geomagnetic reference field corrected archive aeromagnetic data used for this research was obtained from the botswana geoscience institute this data was acquired between 1986 by geosurvey international gmbh using scintrex cesium vapour magnetometer of 0 01 nt sensitivity flight lines were 1 km apart at mean terrain clearance of 150 m data preparation for this exercise included windowing aeromagnetic grid sufficiently covering the study area from the recompiled nationwide magnetic data the data bears an enhanced 50 m resolution magnetic grids released by the then department of geological survey in 2012 following a nationwide tie line survey of airborne magnetics in 2010 2011 reford et al 2013 the interpretation of the aeromagnetic data was done with the aim of determining the orientation and spatial extent of lineaments found in the nca because they play a major role in the flow of groundwater the initial process of analyzing aeromagnetic data included the reduction to pole which was done in order to reduce the effect of magnetic inclination which has an advantage of improving interpretation of the map by centering the anomalies directly above their sources detail enhancement filters were also applied to the aeromagnetic data to emphasize the edges of linear features in the tmi grid and outline zones of weathering from calculating magnetic susceptibility depth of weathering is important for water percolation the output of processing aeromagnetic data is the production of lineament density map which was used to validate the structural lineaments obtained from processing satellite images of the area takorabt et al 2018 have also confirmed the presence of structural lineaments of landsat 7 etm satellite images using geophysical results and geological map geological lineaments of shallower to a few hundred meters of depth are of importance to groundwater dynamics which sustains the lives of humans and vegetation by providing fresh water the depth to sources and locations of magnetic sources where lineaments were derived from anomaly gradients were computed using the euler deconvolution technique the euler s equation adapted by reid et al 1990 is given by 1 x x o f x y y o f y z z o f z n b f which represents the strength f of a potential field in this case magnetic at a point x y z in space due to a source located at xo yo zo in terms of the first order derivatives f x f y and f z regional background component b and the structural index n the structural index that was used in this objective was one 1 which is targeted at the rate at which the field f falls off with distance for approximately linear features such as faults dykes and sills reid et al 1990 which encourage secondary porosity in hard rock terrains roy 2014 several indices have been derived for other source types as discussed by dentith and mudge 2014 a 50 m square window was used as the depth estimation procedure relies on the field curvature within the data window used and the minimum depths returned are about the same as the grid interval while the maximum depths are about twice the window size reid et al 1990 solutions with a depth tolerance greater than 5 were discarded in addition to aeromagnetic data processing apparent susceptibility k calculation yields measurable estimates of the relationship between magnetic flux density b and magnetizing force h this relationship is given by 2 b kh apparent susceptibility is an inversion technique that was used to convert the magnetic field strength into an apparent physical property map by applying a compound filter the physical property map approximates true susceptibilities and gives an indication of the local geology silva and hohmann 1984 the susceptibility filter comprises of reduction to the pole downward continuation to the source depth correction of the geometric effect of a vertical square ended prism and division by the total magnetic field to yield susceptibility grant 1973 the apparent susceptibility of the prism as presented by yunsheng et al 1985 is given by the relation 3 t u v 2 π t o m u v h u v s u v k j d j x y u v where to is the earth s magnetic field intensity m u v h u v s u v dj x y u v are magnetization depth size displacement factors respectively k being the susceptibility u v representing wavenumbers in x y direction and j denoting the prism index in a grid of n prisms the size and magnetization factors are the same for all prisms while reduction to the pole and downward continuation removes the displacement and depth factors respectively rocks highly concentrated with ferro and or ferrimagnetic minerals tend to have high susceptibilities acidic igneous and metamorphic rocks having average to low susceptibilities while sedimentary rocks have generally low susceptibilities reynolds 2011 apparent susceptibility of the aeromagnetic grid of the study area was calculated to determine the degree of geologic alteration in the study area which is also affected by groundwater presence ranganai and ebinger 2008 have acknowledged the use of apparent susceptibility maps in identifying areas with potential for deep weathering alteration zones or thick permeable regolith 3 3 satellite imagery remote sensing the significance of satellite data is that they provide invaluable information on the surface properties of the ground which affects the hydrological process of the area enhancement of satellite imagery comes handy when interpreted for lineament mapping land use land cover and dems digital elevation models for extracting drainage patterns of an area 3 4 land use land cover mapping land covers in an area can create an impervious layer which alters the hydrology of the area causing flooding or allowing surface waters to percolate into the subsurface dependent on the transmissivity of the ground the infiltration rate which is also affected by different land covers controls surface water flow and with impervious surfaces excess water begins to accumulate as surface storage in small depressions governed by surface topography which could potentially recharge groundwater sources by percolation or lost through evaporation the significance of land cover mapping helped in demarcating the general areas which are semi impervious like built up areas and portions that bear the natural landscape of the area the land cover classification of the study area was carried out through supervised image classification of 2009 landsat 7 etm and 2019 landsat 8 oli tirs images covering the study area for the rows and paths indicated in table 1 these satellite images were chosen considering the spatial resolution of 30 m which improved the output of land cover classes with a higher resolution the changes in land cover between 2009 and 2019 were expected to be significant in creating imperviousness and or altering runoff generation with implications for ground water recharge a total of 6 major land cover land use classes were identified in the study area by virtual interpretation which were considered for image classification a standard false colour of 5 4 3 representing blue green and red respectively for landsat 8 oli tirs and 4 3 2 for landsat 7 etm enhanced the images for assessing the classes of land covers in fig 4 these classes are described in table 2 a ground truthing follow up was carried out at designated points generated through systematic sampling to ensure that all land cover classes are checked to evaluate the performance of the classification algorithm this process is referred to as accuracy assessment congalton and green 2008 outlined the importance of knowing the accuracy of a map produced as effective decisions about the extent and distribution of resources lies on accurate maps or at least maps of known accuracy 3 5 lineament mapping lineaments are classified as either edges or lines on a digital grey scale image farahbakhsh et al 2018 the exercise of lineament mapping is a systematic process that involves satellite image processing techniques to extract linear features which are surface expressions of the local geology of an area the main advantage of lineament detection to this study is that geological lineaments dykes faults fractures surface discontinuities cleavages river reaches are an integral part which largely controls groundwater flow however yeh et al 2016 noted that this approach of lineament detection in satellite imagery is capable of detecting non geologic features like paths roads that can be misinterpreted from satellite images and subsequently causing errors in the analysis of lineaments hence the need for validation using geophysical methods which have the advantage to remotely image the subsurface zeil et al 1991 also emphasized the need for an integrated approach using aeromagnetic data as prevalent cover can considerably conceal detection of lineaments from satellite imagery ranganai and ebinger 2008 further add that aeromagnetic data investigates deeper lineaments than remote sensing river reaches were detected through a series of networking lineaments following riparian vegetation and low elevations for drainage characterization non geologic lineaments helped in demarcating built up areas from other land classes which are characteristics possessed by this class over other land covers 3 6 dem and drainage networks digital terrain model is a three dimensional surface of the terrain that is packed with digital information where a variety of hydrological and terrain characteristics of an area can be extracted saraf et al 2004 digital terrain modelling was performed for this research to derive the slope aspect flow accumulation and stream networks within the notwane catchment these terrain properties provide invaluable information about the study area where the core objective is the understanding of water flow dynamics from the surface into the subsurface saraf et al 2004 further elaborates on the derivatives of dem not just being a spatial distribution of elevation with reference to an arbitrary datum but other variables like groundwater levels chemical qualities of water can be also represented the dem for the area was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm 3 7 groundwater recharge optimization gis weighted overlay analysis the data collected for the study area and ancillary data from document study was integrated in a gis environment to produce a groundwater potential recharge site map for the area this integration draws optimum synergy of geophysical data and other remotely sensed data the different thematic maps derived from the discussed methodologies were assigned relative weights and rankings according to their suitability in aiding groundwater recharge using analytic hierarchy process ahp approach the thematic maps for the area constituted spatial data consisting of lineament density map slope elevation land use land cover drainage network flow accumulation apparent magnetic susceptibility and soil types weighting criteria developed by saaty and vargas 2012 for assigning weights to the variables used in this process is shown in table 3 this weighting criteria simply ranks a variable against another according to the objective and desired output in which case for this study variables were compared on their importance to aiding groundwater recharge saaty and vargas 2012 s pairwise comparison scale was used to determine the relevance of the variables e g lineaments in first row in table 4 to other variables column 2 8 to determine the weight of each variable in the last column in this example when lineaments are compared to lineaments the judgment yields an equally important result but when compared to land cover lineaments are extremely important the overall weight assigned to each variable was dependent on individual comparison of lineaments to the other six variables this step was repeated for the other 6 variables the steps involved in calculating the weights entailed summing up the columns to generate a scaled influence measure which was later used to normalize the matrix as discussed by mu and pereyra rojas 2017 occurrence of inconsistencies in judgments is resolved in the ahp process and it provides means of improving consistency saaty and vargas 2012 the analytic hierarchy process was used to analyze data for groundwater recharge potential over the catchment in which the variables were scaled and weighted based on literature and best judgment maxwell 2018 soil types and land cover classes which were part of the inputs in modelling groundwater optimization datasets were assigned discrete values according to their relative influence on groundwater recharge since their data is not continuous for soil types these scales were based on field soil moisture capacity fsmc of different soils within the study area which correspond to their clay content whereas land cover was based on the level of permeability of different classes other data sets which were continuous were scaled from 0 to 1 indicating low to high respectively and this included elevation slope apparent susceptibility lineament density and flow accumulation in which the last two were converted to continuous data by calculating the euclidean distance from the features these variables affect groundwater recharge and discharge the drainage patterns and amount of rainfall within the study area are also critical to groundwater recharge 4 results and discussions 4 1 euler deconvolution and magnetic susceptibility processing of archive aeromagnetic data with fitting algorithms discussed in the methodology chapter to draw inferences on major regional features of groundwater importance yielded lineament and standard euler deconvolution solution maps figs 5 and 6 respectively predominant structures and their trends show that the area has geologic lineaments with varying orientations on areas which were gridded during data collection lineaments present secondary porosity which controls ground water flow by either creating barriers dykes or path faults most of the lineaments drawn from standard euler solutions are in shallow depth range of 0 100 m fig 7 which play a significant role on groundwater flow that is easily accessible for abstraction ranganai and ebinger 2008 also acknowledged the same fact about lineaments bearing considerable depth likely to be open groundwater conduits hard rock terrains as is the case with the local geology fresh granites within nca presents limited groundwater availability as compared to weathered and fractured subsurface the vertical derivative map fig 5 shows enhanced lineaments and edges of magnetic bodies the faded portion on the greater gaborone area is a result of no data recorded in the area and covered by interpolated values at a larger cell size the cell size for the grids used here was 50 m and a projected coordinate system of utm zone 35 part of the muted area shown in the map in fig 5 were not surveyed due to restricted activities and security reasons for military airbase which lies on the western part of the study area the standard euler solutions plotted here were categorized on depth ranges of 0 100 100 200 and depths of more than 200 m a 10 tolerance of solutions was set in order to generate more reliable solutions which were later filtered based on dxy x offset and y offset which yielded fewer solutions lineaments in the notwane have varying orientations length as well as depths majority of the lineaments are shallower whereas deeper ones show similar orientation and slightly varying lengths at the same ground locations the area surrounding the greater gaborone do not show lineaments as there was no data for computing the euler deconvolution in the area the apparent susceptibility map shows distinct apparent susceptibilities where areas at higher elevations fig 10 a corresponds with high apparent susceptibilities the central part of the catchment has average apparent susceptibilities compared to elevated areas and those exhibiting lower apparent susceptibilities magnetic susceptibilities have a geological significance on the degree of alteration of rocks due to groundwater presence there is higher apparent susceptibility range in the general notwane catchment which provides a varied option to suitable sites for groundwater recharge based on the apparent susceptibilities calculated southern parts of the catchment and an area near mochudi have high apparent susceptibilities which could be inferred to be strongly magnetized rocks whereas other areas have low apparent susceptibilities of 0 00092 that could be associated with deeply weathered oxidized igneous and metamorphic rocks and rarely non magnetized sediments since the notwane area overlays a crystalline basement the advantage of having both these extreme susceptibilities is that weaker apparent susceptibilities present a fitting environment for groundwater recharge while formations with high apparent susceptibilities would bound and control groundwater flow from escaping the point of recharge other areas fall within the average spectrum of apparent susceptibility the greater gaborone area shows noisy streaks on this spectrum which is a result of data unavailability 4 2 satellite image processing 4 2 1 land cover the map in fig 9 shows six major classes of land use land cover found in the study area for two years 2009 2019 the change in land cover between this period is summarized in table 5 which shows gains and losses of different classes error matrix and accuracy assessment results of 2019 land cover map are also shown in succeeding table 6 precipitation is the source of water that feeds both surface and groundwater sources where landcover is the primary filter of surface water that seeps and flow through the drainage system of the area the six major landcovers identified in the area have different impacts on the dynamics of percolation the overall accuracy assessment of the 2019 image was 75 5 this area is mostly covered in vegetation of varying densities and the natural landscape has been preserved for more than 96 of the total notwane area as of 2019 thick hilly vegetation which is indicative of abrupt topographic change mostly influences the surface flow of runoff or barrier to storm water or floods this area covers about 15 of the area and resembles geologic structures that coincide with high subsurface and outcropping rocks of high magnetic strength these structures are observed on the southernmost part of the study area with north west south east trend and also with a west east trend in the upper part of notwane catchment the built up area has expanded significantly between 2009 and 2019 resulting in an impervious land cover which has disturbed normal percolation of surface water and causing localized flooding in towns flooding in such areas is controlled by drainage system which drains storm water into the natural system the amount of surface water as seen in table 5 and fig 9 has reduced slightly during this period which could be attributed to abstraction to meet water demands in the area in summary land cover changes which did not impact the permeability of the surface are vegetation classes which only changed due to varying rainfall and other weather conditions 4 2 2 dem the following image assortments fig 10 were processed from srtm data to generate drainage patterns for the notwane catchment which govern the dynamics of surface runoff generated from the catchment the drainage system of the study area is incomplete due to administrative boundary between botswana and south africa and as a result limiting the study area to the botswana side there is a great influence of flow accumulation as some river channels flow from the neighboring country the affected area here lies on the southeastern part of the study area along lobatse and ramotswa where there is a transboundary aquifer shared by the countries the notwane catchment area has a varying topographic relief with higher elevations bounding the area on the western side the change in elevation is mostly gentle on the eastern side of the area which is mostly covered by ground sloping less than 2 degrees this is suitable ground for allowing natural percolation of rainwater without discharging most of the surface as runoff 4 3 groundwater optimization the following fig 11 is the output of the weighted overlay technique weights of the variables in table 4 used in modelling potential groundwater recharge sites shown in fig 11 were key inputs in the ahp tool and the output was categorized in classes of four different recharge potentials being poor minimal moderate and strong zones the infeasible areas with empty output for groundwater recharge potential which have not been categorized are indicated by flow direction of surface runoff on the right map in fig 11 below these are areas dominated by impervious surfaces built up area steep slopes soils with higher clay content high fsmc and higher apparent susceptibilities these impervious and semi impervious surfaces generate runoffs and prevent infiltration of rainwater which is collected through storm water drainage system which are sometimes overloaded causing floods thus providing source of water to recharge groundwater sources geological lineaments outside the built up areas are fundamental structures that affect groundwater movement as they are conduits to groundwater flow which leads to aquifers the slope and topography of the area affect direction of surface water flow by gravity and careful assessment of the area including the type of lithology play a vital role in determining the suitable areas that can be proposed to be ideal groundwater recharge zones the catchment has a total of 20 watersheds in which four are shared between botswana and south africa as shown in fig 11 groundwater recharge optimization draws individual aspects discussed in the methodology into an ideal recharge system where excess surface runoff generated from surplus water flooding is stored underground to be used during water shortage based on findings from a research conducted by tafila 2020 on the notwane catchment there is evident trend of declining groundwater levels across the whole catchment on the same study runoffs were seen to have increased significantly between the years 2009 and 2019 despite the modelled runoff only considering contribution of climatic variables to the exclusion of land cover and land use changes investigation of surface and subsurface of the catchment yielded input data for groundwater optimization model the use of continuous and discrete raster datasets yielded output of different categories of recharge potential the main strengths of the model were on variables with more influence in groundwater dynamics and these included spatial extents with high lineament densities and low apparent susceptibilities which are indicative of secondary porosities in a similar study chuma and hlatywayo 2013 has indicated that zones of increased porosity and permeability were proximal to lineaments which greatly increases the chance of groundwater accumulation empty output is an infeasible site due to unfavorable land use e g built up or rather a complex nature of the subsurface which has little relevance to groundwater sources like areas with high magnetic susceptibilities shown in fig 8 areas with higher recharge potential lies on the central part of the catchment northeastern margin and the southernmost part bounded by topographical relief of hills with thick vegetation the unclassified areas on the model output mainly comprise of built up areas and areas with high magnetic susceptibilities these areas are likely to generate increased runoff due to limited infiltration of storm water which will be redirected to watershed outlet points through areas of high flow accumulation and ultimately main river systems 5 conclusion significant geological lineaments and land covers of the notwane catchment were generated and analyzed for potential groundwater recharge most lineaments generated were shallower with general east west direction whilst a few were more than 200 m deep these lineaments combined with complex land cover of pervious and impervious surfaces provide limited potential conduits of groundwater flow within the catchment the varied groundwater potential within the notwane catchment is due to non uniform distribution of theses lineaments and varied magnetic susceptibilities which are measures of intensity of weathering it can be inferred that poor groundwater recharge potential areas are furthest from lineaments and low magnetic susceptibility zones areas with low elevations and high flow accumulation are potential sites for capturing runoff in detention ponds and check dams at suitable watershed outlet points while areas with high elevations are less weathered and do not allow surface water to percolate without flowing to low flat area the magnetic susceptibility map indicates that areas with high elevation have relatively high magnetic susceptibility high magnetic susceptibility zones are presumably less weathered and lack secondary porosity for effortless groundwater recharge groundwater recharge optimization encompassing ahp shows that areas with higher recharge potential lie on the central part of the nca northeastern margin and the southernmost part bounded by topographical relief of hills with thick vegetation though not tested by ground follow up methods the multi disciplinary approach used could offer a more reliable way to identify potential recharge zones particularly in
