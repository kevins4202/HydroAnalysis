14055,in this study a pilot scale anoxic aerobic biofilter system combined with chemical precipitation was devised and applied for the tertiary treatment of nitrogen and post treatment of phosphorus and residual organics in effluent from existing wastewater treatment facilities when the system operated under a system hydraulic retention time hrt of 5 98 h nitrified effluent recirculation ratio of 0 5 average methanol supplement concentration of 23 2 mg l and average aluminum sulfate concentration of 2 37 mg l the average concentration of bod5 cod ss tn and tp in the system effluent were 3 3 10 4 4 2 6 1 and 0 43 mg l respectively despite the shorter hrt of 1 35 h in the anoxic filter packed with media noticeable denitrification was achieved rapidly a perfect nitrification rate was achieved and no clear deterioration in performance by chemical addition was observed thus the system achieved not only outstanding nitrogen removal performance but also the additional removal of residual organics and phosphorus keywords anoxic filter aerobic filter biofilter system chemical precipitation tertiary treatment 1 introduction recently the quality requirement of wastewater treatment has become increasingly stricter and the magnitude of eutrophication is on the rise globally thus conventional wastewater treatment processes need to be improved to meet the water quality criteria because of the limitation of conventional wastewater treatment methods in satisfying the water quality criteria in terms of nutrient removal tertiary treatment processes have been devised and applied studies on the tertiary treatment of wastewater have been conducted using various processes such as membrane filtration micro ultra and nano filtration as well as reverse forward osmosis 1 2 advanced oxidation process aop 3 6 and electrochemical aop 7 8 conventional wastewater treatment processes require upgrades with the installation of additional processes and equipment for the tertiary treatment to meet the water quality criteria 9 however the tertiary treatment processes face difficulties in simultaneously removing residual organics nitrogen and phosphorus because their mechanisms are limited to oxidation filtration and disinfection meanwhile among the available processes the biofilter process using attached biomass has been widely employed for tertiary treatment 9 12 biofilters proved their competitive efficiencies with higher biomass concentration per unit volume lower energy consumption and reduced sludge production compared to conventional activated sludge processes 13 14 however biological nitrogen removal requires an additional electron donor i e carbon source for denitrification irrespectively for process configuration owing to the lower organic concentration in effluent from treatment facilities difficulty in phosphorus removal in biofilter processes caused by problems associated with the disposal of phosphate uptake biomass is another limitation even though successful phosphorus removal in biofilter system were reported 15 16 specific media was required in this study a pilot scale anoxic aerobic biofilter system with merit in nitrogen removal combined with chemical precipitation for phosphorus removal was devised and applied for the tertiary treatment of nitrogen and the post treatment of residual organics and phosphorus in effluent from an existing wastewater treatment plant in addition the performance applicability reliability and adaptability evaluation of devised system operating with chemical coagulant which has adverse effect on biological wastewater treatment was also performed 2 material and methods 2 1 pilot scale anoxic aerobic biofilter system combined with chemical precipitation a pilot scale anoxic

aerobic filter four porous diffusers composed of an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer were installed for aeration one per each quarter of the cross sectional area each diffuser was connected to an air line with a valve to control the air flowrate which was in the range of 50 150 l min ea 2 5 operational methods a secondary effluent from the wastewater treatment plant located in pocheon korea was used as the influent in this study the anoxic and aerobic filters were inoculated with activated sludge of 4 5 m3 and 3 m3 respectively the system was operated at a hydraulic retention time

hrt on removal of non biodegradable organics the methanol dose to the anoxic filter was determined according to biochemical oxygen demand bod5 to nitrate ratio c n ratio for supplementation of the

kg d was applied to control the alkalinity a sludge scraper and transportation equipment were operated at a sludge disposal rate of 120 min d and the concentrations were 48 52 l d and 9 910 16 580 mg l respectively both the anoxic and aerobic filters were periodically backwashed using a combined air water backwash method to prevent increment headloss by biomass growth the air water volume ratio for backwashing the anoxic and aerobic filters were 0 875 and 0 878 respectively 2 6 analytical methods sampling to analyzing the profiles of contaminants along the flow path was performed from each sampling port of each filter directly after the remaining 200 ml sample in the sampling port was wasted a 1 l sample was used for analysis to investigate the mass of the attached biomass a media size of 10 cm 20 cm 2 5 cm from the anoxic filter and a media volume of 100 ml from the aerobic filter were scrubbing manually for biomass detaching with 1 l and 500 ml of distilled water respectively all analyses except total nitrogen tn were conducted as per procedures in the american public health association apha standard methods 17 bod5 of influent and effluent was measured by 5 day bod test 5210 b with digital dissolved oxygen meter ysi inc model no 5100 and chemical oxygen demand cod analysis was conducted as procedure of closed reflux method 5220 c ammonia and nitrate were measured by titrimetric method 4500 nh3 c and cadmium reduction method 4500 no3 e respectively tn concentration was measured by ultraviolet absorption spectrum method in korean standard method and it was compared to the tn concentration calculated by sum of total kjeldahl nitrogen conducted as procedure of titrimetric method 4500 norg b and nitrate conducted by cadmium reduction method 4500 no3 e in apha standard methods the correlation between two methods was 90 r2 0 997 concentration of total phosphorus tp was measured by ascorbic acid method 4500 p e 3 results and discussion the pilot scale anoxic aerobic filter system combined with chemical precipitation for the tertiary treatment of wastewater was evaluated the overall performances of the system operated under the conditions of system hrt of 5 98 h recirculation ratio of 0 5 average methanol supplement concentration of 23 2 mg l and average aluminum sulfate concentration of 2 37 mg l were summarized in table 2 the average removals of bod5 cod ss tn and tp were 89 1 71 2 49 0 62 9 and 55 7 respectively the system maintained effluent bod5 cod ss tn and tp as low as 1 4 4 9 mg l average 3 3 mg l 5 5 12 9 mg l average 10 4 mg l 2 1 6 6 mg l average 4 2 mg l 2 5 10 1 mg l average 6 1 mg l and 0 29 0 63 mg l average 0 43 mg l respectively the effects of influent bod loading rate and hrt on bod removal and its rate are presented in fig 2 compared to results of the system under the hrt condition of 5 98 h the system operated at an hrt of 9 09 h and a higher removal rate was observed clearly at the same loading rate it appears that the higher removal was due to the increment of contact time between the attached biomass and the contaminant hrt increased as linear velocity decreased in addition the removal of organics derived from solids improved obviously owing to the improvement in solids removal by the decrement of flow velocity between each media numerous studies 18 21 indicated that shorter contact time between the contaminant and the microbial biomass in the biofilter system could lead to insufficient degradation of target pollutants moreover the bod removal rate increased in proportion to the increment of influent bod loading rate this is mainly attributed to the diffusivity of contaminants into the biofilm priya and philip 21 insisted that performance improvement at higher organic loading rates was a result of the increment of concentration gradient which enhanced the contaminants diffusion from the bulk liquid to the attached biofilm fig 3 demonstrates the profiles of nitrate and ammonia along the flow path in the system at the bottom of the anoxic filter that is the chemical precipitation zone denitrification of nitrate was not observed however through the media packed area a rapid decline in nitrate concentration occurred and its average decrement rate per media height was 3 63 mg l m the calculated specific denitrification rate with biomass detached by backwashing was a reasonable value of 0 144gno3 n gmlvss d in comparison with that in other studies the denitrification rate decreased as the media height increased it should be considered that the denitrification of nitrate requires carbon as an electron donor 22 24 the optimum c n ratio for denitrification has been reported as 4kgbod kgno3 n or greater 25 26 rocher et al 27 indicated that an optimal c n ratio in the range of 3 0 3 2 allows a complete denitrification and they announced that increasing the c n ratio could induce a residual bod in the effluent although the performance of the biofilter system could be improved at higher organic loading rates owing to the increment of the concentration gradient as aforementioned the mass of the carbon source addition must be calculated considering both the nitrate concentration in the influent and the residual bod in the effluent in this system the methanol dose was calculated with an average c n ratio of 3 65 despite the addition of methanol as an electron donor for denitrification perfect denitrification was not achieved however the nitrogen concentration in the effluent conformed to the water quality criteria assuming the denitrification reaction as a first order reaction of nitrate concentration the denitrification rate coefficient was calculated as 0 0322 min 1 at a water temperature of 26 5 using the following equations dn dt k no3 no3 no3 0 exp k t where no3 nitrate concentration at time t mg l k denitrification rate coefficient min 1 no3 0 initial nitrate concentration mg l t reaction time min the time required for the average denitrification rate of the anoxic filter in this study was 42 min based on the calculated denitrification coefficient according to the equation in addition 71 5 and 93 min were required theoretically to achieve denitrification rates of 90 and 95 with calculated denitrification rate coefficient of 0 0322 min 1 at a water temperature of 26 5 respectively thus an enhanced denitrification rate could be achieved by the addition of more external electron donors and an extension of hrt the ammonia concentration in the effluent from the anoxic filter was 9 7 mg l and the nitrification rate was 91 8 in aerobic filter compared to the denitrification result of the anoxic filter the nitrification rate increased as the media height increased because of the gradual decrement of organics the average ammonia decrement rate per media height was 5 93 mg l m the calculated specific nitrification rate with biomass which was detached by backwashing was 0 181 gnh4 n gmlvss d when the nitrification reaction was assumed as a first order reaction of the ammonia concentration the nitrification rate coefficient was calculated as 0 0712 min 1 at a water temperature of 26 5 using the equations with the substitution of no3 for nh4 despite chemical precipitation being the most definitive method for phosphorus removal frequent backwashing caused by the accumulation of chemical sludge in the biofilter system could deteriorate the system performance moreover chemical agents affect the reactor conditions such as ph and redox potentials 28 which can change the activities of biomass therefore the investigation of the adverse effect of the aluminum sulfate dose on nitrogen removal in this system is crucial the effect of the aluminum sulfate dose on nitrification and denitrification in the system is illustrated in fig 4 despite the possibility of mass transfer disturbance by chemicals a noticeable variation in the average nitrification rate was not observed however as the aluminum sulfate dose increased the minimum nitrification rate value decreased yang et al 29 and liu et al 30 reported an adverse effect of aluminum accumulation on ammonia oxidation bacteria aob in particular liu et al 30 indicated that the aob activities could deteriorate with aluminum salt doses above 5 4 mg l although no significant deterioration in denitrification by the aluminum sulfate dose was observed during the entire experimental period the aluminum sulfate dose should be determined carefully because nitrification is a preceding condition for denitrification aluminum sulfate was added to this system as a coagulant for the chemical precipitation of phosphate in the influent commonly phosphate precipitation with an aluminum sulfate solution can be achieved as follows al2 so4 3 2h3po4 2al po4 3h2so4 the effect of the aluminum sulfate dose on tp removal is exhibited in fig 4 a non linear increment of tp removal was observed clearly as the aluminum sulfate dose increased when the system operated under an aluminum sulfate dose in the range of 0 08 5 23 mg l removed tp concentrations ranging 0 02 1 08 mg l were obtained in addition the ratio of aluminum sulfate required to tp removal was calculated as 3 1 5 5 meanwhile when the aluminum sulfate dose exceeded 1 mg l increment of tp removal decreased gradually as shown in fig 5 this could be attributed to the aluminum ion reacting with the hydroxide ion rather than the phosphate ion at higher aluminum sulfate doses because the sodium hydroxide dose increased to maintain the ph level for coagulation as the aluminum sulfate dose increased the reaction between aluminum sulfate and phosphate decreased owing to the higher level hydroxide ion in fact the chemical precipitation process must consider the economic terms as the aluminum sulfate dose increased sodium hydroxide was also required for ph maintenance and it generated an excessive aluminum hydroxide precipitate therefore the appropriate dose of aluminum sulfate should be calculated and applied for chemical precipitation fig 6 illustrates the solids concentration at the settling zone as well as the profiles of solids in the system the flowrate and concentration of waste solids fluctuated according to the influent solids concentration and the nitrified effluent recirculation and were in the range of 48 52 l d and 9910 16 580 mg l respectively despite numerous solids being generated by chemical precipitation most of them sunk at the settling zone in the anoxic filter and the residual solids were filtered by both filters in the anoxic filter the mass of attached biomass per unit volume of media total mass of attached biomass and mass of attached biomass per specific surface area were 15 6 mg cm3 70 2 kg and 38 g m2 respectively in the aerobic filter the values were 9 7 mg cm3 32 7 kg and 6 1 g m2 respectively typically biofilter processes require periodic backwashing to avoid the deterioration of stability including short circuiting caused by solids clogging 31 35 fig 7 presents the headloss variation of the anoxic and aerobic filters the backwashing of both filters was conducted at an air water linear velocity of 0 7 m min and 0 4 m min as shown in fig 7 the backwashing was more frequent in the anoxic filter to prevent the accumulation of solids generated by chemical addition the anoxic filter was backwashed when the headloss was in the range of 12 5 13 5 cm and the backwashing interval was approximately 9d meanwhile during the 10d after backwashing the increment of headloss was not significant in the aerobic filter however the headloss in the aerobic filter increased sharply from 6 to 38 5 cm after 10d the porosity of the media in the aerobic filter was lower than that packed in the anoxic filter as summarized in table 1 thus the porosity difference could have led to the headloss difference between the anoxic and aerobic filters during the long term experiment as mentioned previously average effluent concentrations of bod5 cod tn tp from the system were maintained 3 3 10 4 6 1 and 0 43 mg l respectively treatability evaluation based on the experiment data is important to securing the reliability of the system in this study frequency curves for system effluent was used for the evaluation the system reliability fig 8 depicts the possibility of observations equal to or less than the stated effluent organics nitrogen and tp the probability of effluent bod5 and cod less than 4 5 and 12 mg l respectively were up to 90 the amount of effluent ammonia and nitrate less than 1 0 and 10 mg l respectively were as high as 98 the system performance was successfully predicted based on these results 4 conclusions a pilot scale anoxic aerobic filter system for the tertiary treatment of nitrogen combined with chemical precipitation for the post treatment of residual organics and phosphorus in secondary effluent discharged from existing wastewater treatment plants was devised and applied the chemical precipitation and anoxic aerobic filter complemented each other chemical precipitation using aluminum sulfate contributed to a substantial reduction in phosphorus the resulting anoxic aerobic filter system successfully performed organic oxidation denitrification nitrification and residual solid filtration despite the addition of chemicals biological reactions did not deteriorate as a result of appropriate chemical dosing despite the adverse effect of chemical addition for aob perfect nitrification was achieved in the biological aerobic filter the anoxic filter also achieved excellent denitrification with a relatively short hrt of 1 35 h therefore the system serves as another suitable alternative for the tertiary treatment of wastewater owing to its compactness land availability and reliability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
14055,in this study a pilot scale anoxic aerobic biofilter system combined with chemical precipitation was devised and applied for the tertiary treatment of nitrogen and post treatment of phosphorus

and no clear deterioration in performance by chemical addition was observed thus the system achieved not only outstanding nitrogen removal performance but also the additional removal of residual organics and phosphorus keywords anoxic filter aerobic filter biofilter system chemical precipitation tertiary treatment 1 introduction recently the quality requirement of wastewater treatment has

aerobic filter system combined with chemical precipitation for the tertiary treatment of wastewater was evaluated the overall performances of the system operated under the conditions of system hrt of 5 98 h recirculation ratio of 0 5 average methanol supplement concentration of 23 2 mg l and average aluminum sulfate concentration of 2 37 mg l were summarized in table 2 the average removals of bod5 cod ss tn and tp were 89 1 71 2 49 0 62 9 and 55 7 respectively the system maintained effluent bod5 cod ss tn and tp as low as 1 4 4 9 mg l average 3 3 mg l 5 5 12 9 mg l average 10 4 mg l 2 1 6 6 mg l average 4 2 mg l 2 5 10 1 mg l average 6 1 mg l and 0 29 0 63 mg l average 0 43 mg l respectively the effects of influent bod loading rate and hrt on bod removal and its rate are presented in fig 2 compared to results of the system under the hrt condition of 5 98 h the system operated at an hrt of 9 09 h and a higher removal rate was observed clearly at the same loading rate it appears that the higher removal was due to the increment of contact time between the attached biomass and the contaminant hrt increased as linear velocity decreased in addition the removal of organics derived from solids improved obviously owing to the improvement in solids removal by the decrement of flow velocity between each media numerous studies 18 21 indicated that shorter contact time between the contaminant and the microbial biomass in the biofilter system could lead to insufficient degradation of target pollutants moreover the bod removal rate increased in proportion to the increment of influent bod loading rate this is mainly attributed to the diffusivity of contaminants into the biofilm priya and philip 21 insisted that performance improvement at higher organic loading rates was a result of the increment of concentration gradient which enhanced the contaminants diffusion from the bulk liquid to the attached biofilm fig 3 demonstrates the profiles of nitrate and ammonia along the flow path in the system at the bottom of the anoxic filter that is the chemical precipitation zone denitrification of nitrate was not observed however through the media packed area a rapid decline in nitrate concentration occurred and its average decrement rate per media height was 3 63 mg l m the calculated specific denitrification rate with biomass detached by backwashing was a reasonable value of 0 144gno3 n gmlvss d in comparison with that in other studies the denitrification rate decreased as the media height increased it should be considered that the denitrification of nitrate requires carbon as an electron donor 22 24 the optimum c n ratio for denitrification has been reported as 4kgbod kgno3 n or greater 25 26 rocher et al 27 indicated that an optimal c n ratio in the range of 3 0 3 2 allows a complete denitrification and they announced that increasing the c n ratio could induce a residual bod in the effluent although the performance of the biofilter system could be improved at higher organic loading rates owing to the increment of the concentration gradient as aforementioned the mass of the carbon source addition must be calculated considering both the nitrate concentration in the influent and the residual bod in the effluent in this system the methanol dose was calculated with an average c n ratio of 3 65 despite the addition of methanol as an electron donor for denitrification perfect denitrification was not achieved however the nitrogen concentration in the effluent conformed to the water quality criteria assuming the denitrification reaction as a first order reaction of nitrate concentration the denitrification rate coefficient was calculated as 0 0322 min 1 at a water temperature of 26 5 using the following equations dn dt k no3 no3 no3 0 exp k t where no3 nitrate concentration at time t mg l k denitrification rate coefficient min 1 no3 0 initial nitrate concentration mg l t reaction time min the time required for the average denitrification rate of the anoxic filter in this study was 42 min based on the calculated denitrification coefficient according to the equation in addition 71 5 and 93 min were required theoretically to achieve denitrification rates of 90 and 95 with calculated denitrification rate coefficient of 0 0322 min 1 at a water temperature of 26 5 respectively thus an enhanced denitrification rate could be achieved by the addition of more external electron donors and an extension of hrt the ammonia concentration in the effluent from the anoxic filter was 9 7 mg l and the nitrification rate was 91 8 in aerobic filter compared to the denitrification result of the anoxic filter the nitrification rate increased as the media height increased because of the gradual decrement of organics the average ammonia decrement rate per media height was 5 93 mg l m the calculated specific nitrification rate with biomass which was detached by backwashing was 0 181 gnh4 n gmlvss d when the nitrification reaction was assumed as a first order reaction of the ammonia concentration the nitrification rate coefficient was calculated as 0 0712 min 1 at a water temperature of 26 5 using the equations with the substitution of no3 for nh4 despite chemical precipitation being the most definitive method for phosphorus removal frequent backwashing caused by the accumulation of chemical sludge in the biofilter system could deteriorate the system performance moreover chemical agents affect the reactor conditions such as ph and redox potentials 28 which can change the activities of biomass therefore the investigation of the adverse effect of the aluminum sulfate dose on nitrogen removal in this system is crucial the effect of the aluminum sulfate dose on nitrification and denitrification in the system is illustrated in fig 4 despite the possibility of mass transfer disturbance by chemicals a noticeable variation in the average nitrification rate was not observed however as the aluminum sulfate dose increased the minimum nitrification rate value decreased yang et al 29 and liu et al 30 reported an adverse effect of aluminum accumulation on ammonia oxidation bacteria aob in particular liu et al 30 indicated that the aob activities could deteriorate with aluminum salt doses above 5 4 mg l although no significant deterioration in denitrification by the aluminum sulfate dose was observed during the entire experimental period the aluminum sulfate dose should be determined carefully because nitrification is a preceding condition for denitrification aluminum sulfate was added to this system as a coagulant for the chemical precipitation of phosphate in the influent commonly phosphate precipitation with an aluminum sulfate solution can be achieved as follows al2 so4 3 2h3po4 2al po4 3h2so4 the effect of the aluminum sulfate dose on tp removal is exhibited in fig 4 a non linear increment of tp removal was observed clearly as the aluminum sulfate dose increased when the system operated under an aluminum sulfate dose in the range of 0 08 5 23 mg l removed tp concentrations ranging 0 02 1 08 mg l were obtained in addition the ratio of aluminum sulfate required to tp removal was calculated as 3 1 5 5 meanwhile when the aluminum sulfate dose exceeded 1 mg l increment of tp removal decreased gradually as shown in fig 5 this could be attributed to the aluminum ion reacting with the hydroxide ion rather than the phosphate ion at higher aluminum sulfate doses because the sodium hydroxide dose increased to maintain the ph level for coagulation as the aluminum sulfate dose increased the reaction between aluminum sulfate and phosphate decreased owing to the higher level hydroxide ion in fact the chemical precipitation process must consider the economic terms as the aluminum sulfate dose increased sodium hydroxide was also required for ph maintenance and it generated an excessive aluminum hydroxide precipitate therefore the appropriate dose of aluminum sulfate should be calculated and applied for chemical precipitation fig 6 illustrates the solids concentration at the settling zone as well as the profiles of solids in the system the flowrate and concentration of waste solids fluctuated according to the influent solids concentration and the nitrified effluent recirculation and were in the range of 48 52 l d and 9910 16 580 mg l respectively despite numerous solids being generated by chemical precipitation most of them sunk at the settling zone in the anoxic filter and the residual solids were filtered by both filters in the anoxic filter the mass of attached biomass per unit volume of media total mass of attached biomass and mass of attached biomass per specific surface area were 15 6 mg cm3 70 2 kg and 38 g m2 respectively in the aerobic filter the values were 9 7 mg cm3 32 7 kg and 6 1 g m2 respectively typically biofilter processes require periodic backwashing to avoid the deterioration of stability including short circuiting caused by solids clogging 31 35 fig 7 presents the headloss variation of the anoxic and aerobic filters the backwashing of both filters was conducted at an air water linear velocity of 0 7 m min and 0 4 m min as shown in fig 7 the backwashing was more frequent in the anoxic filter to prevent the accumulation of solids generated by chemical addition the anoxic filter was backwashed when the headloss was in the range of 12 5 13 5 cm and the backwashing interval was approximately 9d meanwhile during the 10d after backwashing the increment of headloss was not significant in the aerobic filter however the headloss in the aerobic filter increased sharply from 6 to 38 5 cm after 10d the porosity of the media in the aerobic filter was lower than that packed in the anoxic filter as summarized in table 1 thus the porosity difference could have led to the headloss difference between the anoxic and aerobic filters during the long term experiment as mentioned previously average effluent concentrations of bod5 cod tn tp from the system were maintained 3 3 10 4 6 1 and 0 43 mg l respectively treatability evaluation based on the experiment data is important to securing the reliability of the system in this study frequency curves for system effluent was used for the evaluation the system reliability fig 8 depicts the possibility of observations equal to or less than the stated effluent organics nitrogen and tp the probability of effluent bod5 and cod less than 4 5 and 12 mg l respectively were up to 90 the amount of effluent ammonia and nitrate less than 1 0 and 10 mg l respectively were as high as 98 the system performance was successfully predicted based on these results 4 conclusions a pilot scale anoxic aerobic filter system for the tertiary treatment of nitrogen combined with chemical precipitation for the post treatment of residual organics and phosphorus in secondary effluent discharged from existing wastewater treatment plants was devised and applied the chemical precipitation and anoxic aerobic filter complemented each other chemical precipitation using aluminum sulfate contributed to a substantial reduction in phosphorus the resulting anoxic aerobic filter system successfully performed organic oxidation denitrification nitrification and residual solid filtration despite the addition of chemicals biological reactions did not deteriorate as a result of appropriate chemical dosing despite the adverse effect of chemical addition for aob perfect nitrification was achieved in the biological aerobic filter the anoxic filter also achieved excellent denitrification with a relatively short hrt of 1 35 h therefore the system serves as another suitable alternative for the tertiary treatment of wastewater owing to its

14056,in this study mil 68 al a metal organic framework and sba 15 santa barbara amorphous 15 a well known silica material were chosen for fabrication of composite material 1 by reflux method the composite 1 named mil 68 al sba 15 was characterized fully tem images and bet results confirmed the crystallization of mil 68 al inside sba 15 channels interestingly the bet surface area increased from 797 m2 g 1 for sba 15 to 947 m2 g 1 for composite 1 herein for the first time we synthesized and used composite 1 for the adsorption of dye pollutants from water the adsorption ability of composite 1 was investigated towards different dye solutions and was compared with the ability of bare mil 68 al and sba 15 the results revealed that the composite 1 adsorbed 100 of mb solution in 0 5 min with a maximum adsorption capacity of 68 93 mg g 1 furthermore the composite 1 was used for adsorption of binary ternary and quaternary mixed dye solutions and showed high adsorption efficiency for removal of all the mixed dye solutions in short time the kinetics of the adsorption process follows the pseudo second order model and the langmuir isotherm model provides the best fitting for the adsorption of mb onto composite 1 also for investigation of the effect of synthesis route on the prepared composite material the composite 2 named mil 68 al sba 15 was synthesized by solid state grinding and its adsorption ability toward dye solutions was compared with composite 1 keywords mil 68 al sba 15 composite hydrostability adsorption organic dyes 1 introduction currently water pollution by dyes is a global problem because large volumes of these substances are used in many industrial fields 1 the discharge of dye molecules into the water can cause severe health issues 2 so removing them before they are released into the environment has become a major challenge for scientists 2 3 according to the guidelines of worldwide environmental protection agencies innovative processes such as extraction chemical oxidation biological photocatalytic degradation and adsorption have been developing to solve the contamination problems 4 5 among these processes adsorption is the most convenient method because of its low energy requirements and simplicity moreover the adsorption method is highly efficient in comparison with other methods 2 3 in recent years metal organic frameworks mof with excellent adsorption abilities have been used to remove dyes from solutions 6 7 mofs are porous materials with fascinating structures high porosity and large surface area 8 9 they are used in potential applications such as separation 10 catalyzation 11 gas storage 12 and adsorption 13 although some unique properties of mofs have been reported many have poor chemical stability and are susceptible to hydrolysis because of the presence of metal ligand coordination bonds 14 since the mofs are mostly microporous that gives rise to a diffusion problem because micropores often impose diffusion limits in the rate of adsorption and reaction the introduction of mesopores has been attempted as a means to solve the diffusion problems 11 15 to date some studies on mof composites with active species including metal nanoparticles metal oxides quantum dots polymers polyoxometalates carbon nanotubes silica and so on have shown remarkable results compared with the individual mofs 15 16 mesoporous silicas are another group of porous materials that have attracted significant attention silica based materials have large specific surface areas high adsorption capacities and high thermal and mechanical stability 17 18 if micro mesoporous materials are accomplished the resulting bimodal pore structured materials would extend the applications of mofs since this would combine the advantages of both shape selectivity for guest molecules while mesopores provide easier access to the adsorption sites in micropores 15 19 furthermore as previously reported the hydrostability of mofs can be improved by incorporating them in silica in the form of composite material mof sio2 20 21 in this study we used sba 15 mesoporous silica 22 23 as the parent material to fabricate the mil 68 al 24 25 inside its channels by reflux method we design this composite for two reasons the mil 68 al shows high adsorption ability towards some of the dye molecules but since it is not hydrostable compound by crystallization of it inside channels of sba 15 its hydrostabbilty will increase in other words when served as a composite material the mofs would be much more stable and conductive porous materials than bare mofs therefore it can provide better performances than their parent mofs also for studying the effect of the synthesis route we prepared composite 2 with solid grinding of sba 15 and mil 68 al the synthesized material was fully characterized and than used for adsorption of several cationic and anionic dye solutions and also mixed dye solutions the effect of adsorbent dosage and initial ph of dye solutions was studied and the optimum condition was selected for the experiments for further detail the kinetic and isotherm of adsorption of mb onto composite 1 was investigated also the stability of composite 1 and its recyclability was studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials terephthalic acid h2bdc 98 aluminum chloride hexahydrate alcl3 6h2o tetraethyl orthosilicate

b rhb crystal violet cv methyl orange mo alizarin yellow r sodium ay and eriochrome black t ebt were of the best available analytical reagent grade and supplied from merck 2 2 synthesis of materials 2 2 1 synthesis of sba 15 sba 15 mesoporous silica was synthesized according to the reported method 22 in brief 12 0 g of p123 was dissolved in a mixed solution of hydrochloric acid 60 ml and deionized water 275 ml and stirred for two hours at room temperature till p123 dissolved completely then teos 27 5 g dissolved in 100 ml deionized water was added dropwise to the solution after 15 min the temperature of the solution increased to 40 c and stirred for ten minutes at this temperature then the mixture was transferred into the teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 100 c for 48 h the white colored solid was filtered off and repeatedly rinsed with deionized water until the filtrate became neutral and then dried at room temperature the obtained solid was placed in a furnace with a heating temperature of 540 c for 6 h under air to remove the structure directing agent the prepared sba 15 was then utilized for the synthesis of composite material 2 2 2 synthesis of mil 68 al briefly terephthalic acid 1 67 g 10 mmol and alcl3 6h2o 1 63 g 6 74 mmol were dissolved separately in 50 ml of dmf then the solution of terephthalic acid in dmf was added to the solution of alcl3 and the mixture was placed in a round bottom flask and refluxed for 18 h at 135 c under air 24 subsequently the mixture was slowly returned to room temperature and the white solid mil 68 al was collected with a centrifuge at 6000 rpm for 10 min for removal of the free acid from its pores the solid was washed several times with dmf finally for removal of dmf from pores the solid was washed three times with methanol and was centrifuged then the synthesized mil 68 al was dried in 80 c for two hours 2 2 3 synthesis of composite 1 mil 68 al sba 15 the composite 1 was synthesized using the 2 1 m ratio of sba 15 and alcl3 6h2o as illustrated in scheme 1 first sba 15 0 4 g 6 66 mmol was suspended into 20 ml of dimethyl formamide and the solution was sonicated for 30 min then terephthalic acid 0 83 g 5 mmol and alcl3 6h2o 0 81 g 3 33 mmol were dissolved separately in 25 ml of dmf and added dropwise to sba 15 suspended solution the mixture was refluxed in a round bottom flask for 24 h at 135 c under air and then slowly returned to room temperature finally the white solid mil 68 al sba 15 was collected with a centrifuge at 6000 rpm for 10 min and was washed with dmf and methanol several times and air dried at 80 c for two hours the icp oes measurements revealed 30 wt si and 6 wt al for composite 1 and confirmed the experimental si al molar ratio of 2 2 2 4 synthesis of composite 2 mil 68 al sba 15 a control experiment was carried out by synthesizing composite 2 with solid state grinding 26 in a typical synthesis 0 64 g of sba 15 and 0 34 g of mil 68 al the amount of materials used here are based on the obtained icp oes data of composite 1 was ground manually in a mortar for 20 min at room temperature then the resulting mixture was oven dried in air at 100 c for 24 h and was used 2 3 adsorption performance test the adsorption ability of synthesized materials was investigated toward different dye solutions in every experiment 25 mg of the synthesized material was transferred into 50 ml of dye solutions at room temperature the initial concentrations of all dyes were 50 mg l 1 except rhb and cv because of their high adsorption and possible errors in the electronic spectra the low concentration as 25 mg l 1 was used in these experiments after soaking the adsorbents in dye solution for a period ranging from 0 5 60 min 2 ml of the sample was withdrawn at specific time intervals and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min to remove the suspended particles the absorption spectra of the dye solutions were analyzed by uv vis spectroscopy because of the high concentration of dyes and consequent intense absorptions in uv vis spectroscopy all samples were diluted before the analysis the dyes used in this research are methylene blue rhodamine b and crystal violet as cationic dyes and methyl orange alizarin yellow and eriochrome black t as anionic dyes the chemical structures of these dyes are shown in fig s1 electronic supplementary material esm the characteristic wavelengths of different dyes were reported as mb λmax 664 nm cv λmax 588 nm rhb λmax 543 nm mo λmax 464 nm ay λmax 362 nm and ebt λmax 540 nm the linear relationship between the concentration of dye solution and absorbance for all of the selected dyes was obtained the percentage of dye removal r and the adsorption capacity q mg g 1 were calculated using the eqs 1 and 2 1 r c 0 c t c 0 100 2 q t c 0 c t m v where c0 and ct are dye concentrations at the initial time and t time mg l 1 v is the volume of solution l and m is the mass of adsorbent g for the investigation of optimum dosage of the adsorbent for the experiments different dosages of composite 1 5 10 15 20 and 25 mg were used for adsorption of mb solution 50 ml 50 mgl 1 the effect of the initial ph of dye solutions on the adsorption ability of 1 was investigated by mixing 15 mg of composite 1 in dye solutions 50 ml with initial ph of 2 4 6 and 8 the initial ph of the dye solutions was adjusted in a range of 2 8 by adding either hcl or naoh solution 0 1 mol l 1 using a ph meter the adsorption ability of composite 1 was studied for removal of different mixed dye solutions at room temperature for these experiments 25 mg of composite 1 and 50 ml of mixed dye solution were used the initial concentrations of all dyes were 50 mg l 1 except rhb and cv which had concentration of 25 mg l 1 the volume ratio of mixed solutions was prepared with volume ratio of 1 1 for binary 1 1 1 for ternary and 1 1 1 1 for quaternary mixed dye solutions in order to study the adsorption kinetics of mb dye onto composite 1 the experiments were carried out under the same operating conditions 25 mg of composite 1 was used for adsorption of 50 ml of mb solution with different concentrations 50 200 mg l 1 at room temperature also for investigation of adsorption isotherms of mb dye onto composite 1 15 mg of composite 1 was used for adsorption of mb solution 50 ml 50 mg l 1 at different temperatures 25 35 45 and 55 c to test the stability and recyclability of composite 1 towards mb solution it was collected and was washed several times with distilled water and ethanol then reused with fresh mb solution this process was repeated for three times also the desorption of mb from mb loaded composite 1 mb composite 1 was evaluated in ethanol with different ph 2 4 6 and 8 2 4 materials characterizations infrared spectra were measured with bomem mb series ft ir spectrometer electronic spectra of samples were obtained with shimadzu uv 2100 spectrophotometer x ray diffraction xrd patterns of prepared materials were analyzed by a stoe diffractometer darmstadt germany using cu kα radiation λ 1 5406 å from a copper anode tube operating at 40 kv and 40 ma zeta potentials of samples were recorded on zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments ltd uk at 298 k and ph 6 the morphologies of the compounds were observed using a tescan mira3 field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem brno czech republic equipped with an energy dispersive x ray analyzer link tem images of composite 1 were observed by a philips cm30 tem eindhoven netherlands operating at 300 kv the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were measured with belsorp mini ii instrument osaka japan at 77 k and the specific surface areas were calculated according to the bet method the pore size and total pore volume of samples were calculated by the bjh method before doing the measurement mil 68 al and composite 1 were degassed at 403 k for 8 h the silicon and aluminum content in 1 was determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy conducted on the espectro arcos spectrometer ametek us 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization the mil 68 al sba 15 composites 1 and 2 were successfully synthesized and characterized by ft ir xrd edx sem tem bet bjh icp and zeta potential ft ir spectroscopy and xrd confirmed the successful synthesis of the materials fig 1 a and b as the ft ir spectrum of sba 15 in fig 1 a shows the characteristic oh stretching vibrations of the silanol groups appeared at 3440 cm 1 and the typical asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration bands of si o si were assigned at 1080 and 804 cm 1 27 28 the ft ir spectrum of mil 68 al showed a broad band around 3425 cm 1 which belonged to the free water oh stretching vibrations and two weak bands at 2940 and 2870 cm 1 which were assigned to the ch stretching vibrations in addition sharp bands at 1612 1411 and 756 cm 1 were attributed to the stretching vibration of co cc bonds and the hydroxyl groups of the corner sharing octahedral alo4 oh 2 respectively 24 25 similarly the ft ir spectrum of composite 1 displayed the characteristic bands correspond to sba 15 and mil 68 al with some shifts to lower energy specifically the sharp band at 1087 cm 1 unambiguously confirmed the presence of sba 15 onto composite 1 the ft ir spectrum of composite 2 is shown in fig s2a the spectrum also displayed similar bands to the ft ir spectrum of composite 1 the powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the synthesized materials are shown in fig 1b in the xrd pattern of sba 15 the diffraction observed at 2θ 1 56 corresponded to the reflection of 100 plane and it was indexed to the ordered hexagonal pore arrays in the silica 22 23 27 28 in the xrd pattern of mil 68 al characteristic diffractions were observed at 2θ 4 96 9 28 10 0 15 52 18 52 and 21 16 which confirmed the successful synthesis of mof 24 25 notably the xrd pattern of 1 showed diffractions of both sba 15 and mil 68 al without any impurities which were somewhat shifted in comparison with mil 68 al moreover in the xrd pattern of 1 the diffractions of sba 15 were displayed in the same position as the parent sba 15 whereas the intensity of the mil 68 al peaks in pattern decreased to some extent by incorporation into the sba 15 channels it would be interesting to compare the xrd diffraction pattern of composite 1 with the xrd pattern of composite 2 the xrd pattern of the composite 2 fig s2b esi similar to the xrd pattern of composite 1 showed a sharp diffraction at 2θ 1 8 which was associated with sba 15 and several weak diffractions at 2θ 4 48 9 4 and 16 54 which corresponded to mil 68 al the very weak diffractions of 2 could be attributed to the low crystallinity of mil 68 al in the composite the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the activated mil 68 al sba 15 and 1 are illustrated in fig 2 and their surface areas and porosities are listed in table 1 the sorption isotherm of sba 15 revealed a reversible type iv with an h1 hysteresis loop suggesting a mesoporous structure according to the iupac classification moreover the h1 hysteresis loop is characteristic of uniform cylindrical channels 27 29 the bet surface area of sba 15 was calculated as 797 m2 g 1 which was somewhat higher than the value reported for this material in the literature 27 28 29 the pore size and the total pore volume of sba 15 were determined using the bjh method as 5 89 nm and 1 17 cm3 g 1 respectively in contrast the adsorption desorption isotherm of mil 68 al exhibited type i sorption behavior with bet surface area of 974 m2 g 1 a pore size of 2 51 nm and a total pore volume of 0 61 cm3 g 1 30 the sharp increase in the nitrogen adsorption isotherm of mil 68 al in the low pressure region suggested the micropores structure of this mof interestingly for composite 1 the n2 adsorption desorption measurements revealed a hybrid of type i and iv isotherms indeed the bet surface area of 947 m2 g 1 and the pore size of 2 81 nm and the total pore volume of 0 66 cm3 g 1 from the bjh calculations were found for the composite 1 as shown in table 1 the comparison of the textural parameters of composite 1 with those of sba 15 and mil 68 al indicated that by incorporating sba 15 and mil 68 al in the form of composite the pore size of the mesoporous silica decreased from 5 89 nm to 2 81 nm and the surface area increased from 797 to 947 m2 g 1 these significant changes in the textural properties could be attributed to the crystallization of mil 68 al inside the channels of sba 15 also the surface charge of the samples was measured at ph 6 as shown in fig s3 sba 15 mil 68 al and composite 1 have negatively charged surface with zeta potentials of 45 3 38 5 and 42 0 mv respectively it reveals the composite 1 has the moderate zeta potential in comparison with sba 15 and mil 68 al the morphology and chemical compositions of mil 68 al sba 15 and the composites 1 and 2 were determined by sem analyses and the images are presented in fig 3 the sem images show well distributed hexagonal particles with relatively uniform sizes arranged in a rope like morphology in sba 15 27 29 and rod like crystals in mil 68 al with comparatively smooth surfaces similar to the those reported in literature 25 30 the rod like particles were aggregated to some extent which was due to the size of the nanoscale particles interestingly the sem image exhibits a rope like morphology for composite 1 similar to sba 15 but with some aggregation considering that the morphologies of composite 1 and the sba 15 particles were similar and there were no rod like particles of mil 68 al as shown in the sem image we concluded that mil 68 al was successfully crystallized inside the channels of sba 15 however the presence of both rope and rod morphologies in the sem image of composite 2 suggests that in the preparation of the composite using the solid state grinding method the mof particles did not crystallize inside the sba 15 channels the edx spectra of mil 68 al sba 15 and composites 1 and 2 which are displayed in fig s4 showed si and o in sba 15 whereas c o and al in mil 68 al and the combination of these elements were shown in composites 1 and 2 it should be mentioned that although we used the same al si ratios in the preparation of both composites the edx analysis revealed a higher al si ratio in composite 2 than in composite 2 the higher al si ratio in the structure of composite 2 was probably due to the crystallization of mil 68 al inside the mesoporous silica which made it hydrolytically stable in contrast because mil 68 al in composite 2 was not supported inside the silica according to the sem analysis it became hydrolytically unstable and the al si ratio was decreased as the tem images of composite 1 in fig 4 a shows the rod like particles of mil 68 al were accommodated inside the rope like channels of sba 15 fig 4b c shows a well organized periodic hexagonal mesostructure which was formed by alternating channels in the silica walls and filled by mil 68 al based on the tem images we concluded that mil 68 al crystallized inside the channels of sba 15 which may have stabilized mof similarly most of the sba 15 pores were occupied by mil 68 al and no individual mil 68 al crystals were visible outside the sba 15 3 2 adsorption of organic dyes 3 2 1 effect of adsorbent dosage and initial ph of dye solutions on the adsorption ability of composite 1 the adsorbent dosage is a vital factor that affects the efficiency of the materials different dosage of composite 1 was used for adsorption of mb solution 50 ml 50 mg l 1 and their uv vis spectra are inserted in fig s5 the illustrated results in fig 5 show that using 5 or 10 mg of adsorbent was not sufficient to promote extensive dye removal and only 38 and 85 of mb solution was removed in 30 min while using 15 25 mg of composite 1 the mb solution was adsorbed completely in a short time of 10 5 and 0 5 min respectively by increasing the dosage of adsorbent the available sites increase which caused adsorption of dye molecules in a short time with high efficiency according to results using 25 mg of composite 1 show the best result for adsorption of mb solution the initial ph of the dye solution is another important parameter that affects adsorption performance because of the changes in the surface charge and binding sites of the adsorbent 31 32 for investigations of ph the experiments were carried out using composite 1 for adsorption of cationic dye solutions with initial ph solution ranging 2 8 the adsorption of the mb solution onto composite 1 was completed in 1 1 10 and 0 5 min at ph of 2 4 6 and 8 respectively fig 6 a these results indicate that composite 1 could be an effective adsorbent in removing of mb solution at a wide range of ph interestingly according to fig 6b the adsorption capacity of composite 1 increased from 62 93 mg g 1 at ph 6 to115 21 mg g 1 at ph 8 this can be attributed to the basic ph because at a higher ph more deprotonated silanol groups sio exist in the structure of composite 1 which possesses stronger electrostatic interaction with mb as cationic dye 33 notably composite 1 was able to remove rhb solution with an efficiency of 57 80 36 and 73 at ph of 2 4 6 and 8 respectively in a short time of 0 5 20 min according to literature the rhb molecule at a low ph has a positive charge due to the protonation of amino and carboxyl groups in contrast at a high ph the molecule has a negative charge as a result of the hydrolysis of carboxyl groups and the deprotonation of amino groups 34 35 it can be concluded that acidic ph is the optimum ph for the adsorption of rhb molecules onto composite 1 because of the strong electrostatic interactions between the cationic charged rhb molecules and the anionically charged adsorbent the highest adsorption capacity that calculated for adsorption of rhb with composite 1 was 47 13 at ph 4 which decrease to 42 66 and 42 16 at ph 6 and 8 respectively fig 6b furthermore the results revealed that the adsorption efficiency of cv solution onto composite 1 increased from 21 to 58 by increasing the initial ph of the solution from 2 to 8 which suggests the alkaline conditions could be the best ph for adsorption of cv solution 34 36 interestingly by increasing ph from 2 to 4 the adsorption capacity increased from 11 76 to 24 76 mg g 1 and also it increased from 20 56 at ph 6 to 35 66 mg g 1 at ph 8 this is associated with the basic condition in the structure of composite 1 in which the deprotonated silanol groups sio exist and possessed stronger electrostatic interaction with cv molecules with a positive charge 3 2 2 adsorption of single dye solution the prepared materials were used for the adsorption of the methylene blue rhodamine b and crystal violet cationic dyes and the methyl orange alizarin yellow and eriochrome black t anionic dyes and their uv vis spectra of dyes solutions during adsorption are shown in fig 7 for further details the colors of dye solutions before and after adsorption with composite 1 are inserted in fig 7 the composite 1 adsorbed 100 of the mb molecules in a short time of 0 5 min as can be seen in fig 7a the adsorption band of mb dropped sharply to zero and the color of the mb dye solution changed from dark blue to colorless also the composite 1 adsorbed 78 and 65 of rhb and cv solution in 20 min respectively steric hindrance was probably the main barrier to the low adsorption of the large dye molecules and steric hindrance of rhb and cv in compare with mb 33 similarly composite 1 show high adsorption efficiency of 100 for mo and ay dyes molecules in 10 and 1 min respectively while it can adsorb 78 of the ebt dye molecules in 20 min this difference in observed adsorption efficiency of composite 1 is attributed to large dye molecules and more steric hindrance of ebt in compare with mo and ay also the photographs in fig 7a f show the color of dye solutions faded after adsorption by composite 1 to demonstrate that the physical mixture of composite constituents was not effective in adsorption of dyes the composite 2 which was prepared by solid state grinding was used to absorb mb and mo dye solutions and the associated uv vis spectra are depicted in fig s6 the results revealed the composite 2 adsorbed only 78 of mb and 40 of mo dye solutions in 60 min the performance of the composite 2 was poor compared with that of the composite 1 which demonstrate the outstanding ability of the composite 1 toward different dyes to visualize the adsorption of dye molecules by composite 1 at the end of adsorption process the dye loaded composite 1 in bottom of beaker was depicted as can be seen in fig 8 after adsorption of different dyes the white color of the solid composite 1 changed to the color of dyes while the dye solutions become colorless the adsorption ability of bare sba 15 and mil 68 al were evaluated toward the selected dye solutions and comapred with composite 1 the related uv vis spectra are shown in fig s7 the results revealed that sba 15 adsorbed mb rhb and cv molecules with adsorption efficiencies of 91 70 and 82 respectively in 30 min whereas it showed no efficiency towards the anionic dyes however the mil 68 al shows better results it adsorbs 100 of mb 75 of rhb and 53 of the cv dye solution in 15 20 and 20 min respectively moreover it completely adsorbs all of anionic dye solutions in 1 5 min fig s8 the results revealed significant increase in the adsorption efficiency of composite 1 in compare with bare material 3 2 3 adsorption of mixed dyes solutions industrial dye wastewater often contains more than one kind of dyes thus series of mixed dye solutions containing mb rhb cv mo ay and ebt were prepared as model industrial dye wastewater to examine the removal efficiency of the composite 1 of mixed dyes solutions the corresponding uv vis spectra of the adsorption of binary mixed dye solution with composite 1 are shown in fig 9 the composite 1 adsorbed the rhb mb and cv mb cationic mixed dyes solutions in 10 and 5 min and also it adsorbed completely the ay mo and mo ebt anionic mixed dye solutions in 0 5 and 10 min respectively furthermore composite 1 was used for adsorption of cationic and anionic binary mixed dyes solutions such as mo mb and mo rhb as can be seen in fig 9e composite 1 adsorbed mo mb solution completely and the adsorption peaks for mb and mo both dropped to zero after 0 5 min interestingly it visualized by eye that the mo mb mixed solution with the dark green color changed to colorless solution meanwhile the colorless composite 1 turned colorful also composite 1 adsorbed mo rhb mixed dyes solution in 30 min which took a long time in comparison with mo mb solution adsorption the difference in adsorption time can be concluded from the fact that rhb is a dye molecule with a large size and more steric hindrance in comparison with mb the results suggest that the adsorption behavior follows not only a charge but also a size shape exclusion effect in continuation the composite 1 was used for adsorption of ternary mixed dye solutions and their uv vis spectra of dyes solutions during adsorption are illustrated in fig 10 a d the composite 1 adsorbed the ternary mixed dyes solutions named as mo rhb mb ay rhb mb and ay mo mb completely and rapidly in a short time of 5 0 5 0 5 min also composite 1 was used for adsorption of quaternary mixed dyes solution named ay mo rhb mb intriguingly composite 1 was adsorbed dye molecules completely in 0 5 min and the colorful solution turned to a colorless solution without any dye molecules the results confirmed the ultrafast and simultaneous adsorption ability of the composite 1 toward both cationic and anionic dyes solutions suggesting that it could be a highly efficient candidate for the adsorption of dyes pollutants in wastewater 3 2 4 adsorption kinetic the kinetic of mb adsorption onto composite 1 was carried out at different concentrations of mb solution 25 200 mg l 1 and the corresponding uv vis spectra were inserted in fig s9 the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models 32 33 36 were fitted with the experimental data and the calculated parameters are tabulated in table 2 according to the calculated adsorption capacities with pseudo second order model are in good consistent with the experimental data furthermore the comparison of the two correlation coefficients r2 demonstrates that the adsorption process of mb onto composite 1 fits well with the pseudo second order model 3 2 5 adsorption isotherm for studing the adsorption isotherms of mb onto composite 1 the adsorption experiments were evaluated at different temperatures 25 55 c and the related uv vis spectra are shown in fig s10 the linear isotherms of mb adsorption onto composite 1 were investigated by langmuir and freundlich models 32 33 37 38 and the calculated parameters are listed in table 3 based on the r2 values the adsorption equilibrium data can be best fitted by langmuir isotherm this suggests the adsorption of mb occurs at specific homogeneous sites and follows a monolayer adsorption process moreover by increasing the temperature of the adsorption process the amount of adsorption capacity was increased this result suggests the adsorption of mb onto composite 1 was endothermic in addition the separation factor rl defined from the langmuir model in eq 3 can be employed to evaluate the feasibility of adsorption 3 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where kl is the langmuir constant l mg 1 and c0 is the initial mb concentration mg l 1 rl indicates the isotherm shape and predicts that the sorption system is favorable 0 rl 1 or unfavorable rl 1 38 the calculated rl value is 0 016 at 25 c which confirms the conditions applied in this study are favorable from the langmuir model the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated as 62 93 mg g 1 at 25 c it is worth mentioning that the adsorption capacity of composite 1 towards mb solution is higher than most of the previously reported sba 15 based composites 22 39 44 as summarized in table 4 3 2 6 adsorption mechanism the mechanism of adsorption of dye molecules by adsorbent in aqueous solution can be affected by many factors such as textural properties surface chemistry of the adsorbent and type of the presented interactions between the adsorbent and dye molecules such as hydrogen bonding electrostatic attractions π π stacking ion exchange coordination and acid base interaction 45 for a specific adsorption process a variety of interactions might occur at the same time as can be seen in fig 11 a there is a large number of silanol groups si oh on the silica surface 33 also the mil 68 al with the structural formula of alo4 oh 2 contains μ2 oh groups in al o al units which can form hydrogen bonding with nitrogen or oxygen atoms of dye molecules 25 according to the scheme illustrated in fig 11b the hydroxyl groups in composite 1 can interact with the amine groups of the mb molecule with hydrogen bonding in addition π π stacking interaction may also work on mb adsorption due to the interaction of the aromatic rings of dye molecule and mil 68 al 45 in the structure of composite 1 also as can be seen in fig 11c the h bonding between hydroxyl groups of sba 15 and mil 68 al and the π π stacking interaction between the aromatic rings of mil 68 al with mo are the efficient interactions for adsorption of mo molecules onto composite 1 in this work the formation of hydrogen bonding and π π stacking interaction have progressed the adsorption of mb and mo molecules onto composite 1 3 2 7 stability and reusability in adsorbents stability and reusability are essential aspects of their practical application based on economic considerations the regeneration of composite 1 was evaluated by desorption of the mb from the mb loaded composite 1 in ethanol solution with ph in the range of 2 8 their uv vis spectra are illustrated in fig s11 the results revealed that most of the mb molecules desorbed in the basic ph of the ethanol solution and ph 8 had the best results for desorption of the mb molecules from the mb loaded composite 1 the recovered composite was reused with fresh mb solution regarding recyclability the results showed that 90 of the adsorption efficiency was retained after three cycles fig 12a the decrease in adsorption efficiency may have been because part of the adsorbed mb molecules trapped inside the pores of the adsorbent which was due to the presence of strong hydrogen bonding and π π interactions between composite 1 with the dye molecules 25 the stability of recycled composite 1 was evaluated with xrd sem and edx analyses as fig 12b shows the recycled composite 1 had xrd pattern similar to the fresh composite 1 where the xrd pattern of the recycled mil 68 al showed changes compared with the fresh mil 68 al fig s12 these changes may have been associated with the poor hydrostability of mil 68 al the sem and edx results of mb loaded composite 1 are inserted in fig 12c the sem images of it showed a rope like morphology similar to the fresh composite but it appeared somewhat puffy after the adsorption of the dye molecules these images indicated that composite 1 maintained its morphology during the adsorption process furthermore the edx analysis demonstrated the presence of si o al c cl n and s in the mb loaded composite 1 the elements cl n and s were components of the mb molecules which confirmed the adsorption of mb onto composite 1 4 conclusion in summary composite 1 named mil 68 al sba 15 was synthesized by the reflux method the bet and tem analyses confirmed the crystallization of mil 68 al inside the channels of sba 15 the composite 2 mil 68 al sba 15 was synthesized with solid state grinding method and characterized the adsorption ability of the prepared composites 1 and 2 and their components mil 68 al and sba 15 toward different dyes were studied composite 1 exhibited the best adsorption efficiency in the removal of the different dye solutions contain mb rhb cv mo ay and ebt in addition composite 1 adsorbed binary ternary and quaternary mixed dyes solution within a short time the pseudo second order kinetic model and the langmuir isotherm were well fit to the adsorption data of mb onto composite 1 furthermore after three cycles composite 1 maintained its high adsorption ability toward the mb molecules as well as its structural stability in this work composite 1 which consisted of a new material combining mil 68 al and sba 15 mesoporous silica was developed using a facile synthesis method the high adsorption efficiency separation convenience and structural stability of the

14056,in this study mil 68 al a metal organic framework and sba 15 santa barbara amorphous 15 a well known silica material were chosen for fabrication of composite material 1 by reflux method the composite 1 named mil 68 al sba 15 was characterized fully tem images and bet results confirmed the crystallization of mil 68 al inside sba 15 channels interestingly the bet surface area increased from 797 m2 g 1 for sba 15 to 947 m2 g 1 for composite 1 herein for the first time we synthesized and used composite 1 for the adsorption of dye pollutants from water the adsorption ability of composite 1 was investigated towards different dye solutions and was compared with the ability of bare mil 68 al and sba 15 the results revealed that the composite 1 adsorbed 100 of mb solution in 0 5 min with a maximum adsorption capacity of 68 93 mg g 1 furthermore the composite 1 was used for adsorption of binary ternary and quaternary mixed dye solutions and showed high adsorption efficiency for removal of all the mixed dye solutions in short time the kinetics of the adsorption process follows the pseudo second order model and the langmuir isotherm model provides the best fitting for the adsorption of mb onto composite 1 also for investigation of the effect of synthesis route on the prepared composite material the composite 2 named mil 68 al sba 15 was synthesized by solid state grinding and its adsorption ability toward dye solutions was compared with composite 1 keywords mil 68 al sba 15 composite hydrostability adsorption organic dyes 1 introduction currently water pollution by dyes is a global problem because large volumes of these substances are used in many industrial fields 1 the discharge of dye molecules into the water can cause severe health issues 2 so removing them before they are released into the environment has become a major challenge for scientists 2 3 according to the guidelines of worldwide environmental protection agencies innovative processes such as extraction chemical oxidation biological photocatalytic degradation and adsorption have been developing to solve the contamination problems 4 5 among these processes adsorption is the most convenient method because of its low energy requirements and simplicity moreover the adsorption method is highly efficient in comparison with other methods 2 3 in recent years metal organic frameworks mof with excellent adsorption abilities have been used to remove dyes from solutions 6 7 mofs are porous materials with fascinating structures high porosity and large surface area 8 9 they are used in potential applications such as separation 10 catalyzation 11 gas storage 12 and adsorption 13 although some unique properties of mofs have been reported many have poor chemical stability and are susceptible to hydrolysis because of the presence of metal ligand coordination bonds 14 since the mofs are mostly microporous that gives rise to a diffusion problem because micropores often impose diffusion limits in the rate of adsorption and reaction the introduction of mesopores has been attempted as a means to solve the diffusion problems 11 15 to date some studies on mof composites with active species including metal nanoparticles metal oxides quantum dots polymers polyoxometalates carbon nanotubes silica and so on have shown remarkable results compared with the individual mofs 15 16 mesoporous silicas are another group of porous materials that have attracted significant attention silica based materials have large specific surface areas high adsorption capacities and high thermal and mechanical stability 17 18 if micro mesoporous materials are accomplished the resulting bimodal pore structured materials would extend the applications of mofs since this would combine the advantages of both shape selectivity for guest molecules while mesopores provide easier access to the adsorption sites in micropores 15 19 furthermore as previously reported the hydrostability of mofs can be improved by incorporating them in silica in the form of composite material mof sio2 20 21 in this study we used sba 15 mesoporous silica 22 23 as the parent material to fabricate the mil 68 al 24 25 inside its channels by reflux method we design this composite for two reasons the mil 68 al shows high adsorption ability towards some of the dye molecules but since it is not hydrostable compound by crystallization of it inside channels of sba 15 its hydrostabbilty will increase in other words when served as a composite material the mofs would be much more stable and conductive porous materials than bare mofs therefore it can provide better performances than their parent mofs also for studying the effect of the synthesis route we prepared composite 2 with solid grinding of sba 15 and mil 68 al the synthesized material was fully characterized and than used for adsorption of several cationic and anionic dye solutions and also mixed dye solutions the effect of adsorbent dosage and initial ph of dye solutions was studied and the optimum condition was selected for the experiments for further detail the kinetic and isotherm of adsorption of mb onto composite 1 was investigated also the stability of composite 1 and its recyclability was studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials terephthalic acid h2bdc 98 aluminum chloride hexahydrate alcl3 6h2o tetraethyl orthosilicate

2 1 synthesis of sba 15 sba 15 mesoporous silica was synthesized according to the reported method 22 in brief 12 0 g of p123 was dissolved in a mixed solution of hydrochloric acid 60 ml and deionized water 275 ml and stirred for two hours at room temperature till p123 dissolved completely then teos 27 5 g dissolved in 100 ml deionized water was added dropwise to the solution after 15 min the temperature of the solution increased to 40 c and stirred for ten minutes at this temperature then the mixture was transferred into the teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 100 c for 48 h the white colored solid was filtered off and repeatedly rinsed with deionized water until the filtrate became neutral and then dried at room temperature the obtained solid was placed in a furnace with a heating temperature of 540 c for 6 h under air to remove the structure directing agent the prepared sba 15 was then utilized for the synthesis of composite material 2 2 2 synthesis of mil 68 al briefly terephthalic acid 1 67 g 10 mmol and alcl3 6h2o 1 63 g 6 74 mmol were dissolved separately in 50 ml of dmf then the solution of terephthalic acid in dmf was added to the solution of alcl3 and the mixture was placed in a round bottom flask and refluxed for 18 h at 135 c under air 24 subsequently the mixture was slowly returned to room temperature and the white solid mil 68 al was collected with a centrifuge at 6000 rpm for 10 min for removal of the free acid from its pores the solid was washed several times with dmf finally for removal of dmf from pores the solid was washed three times with methanol and was centrifuged then the synthesized mil 68 al was dried in 80 c for two hours 2 2 3 synthesis of composite 1 mil 68 al sba 15 the composite 1 was synthesized using the 2 1 m ratio of sba 15 and alcl3 6h2o as illustrated in scheme 1 first sba 15 0 4 g 6 66 mmol was suspended into 20 ml of dimethyl formamide and the solution was sonicated for 30 min then terephthalic acid 0 83 g 5 mmol and alcl3 6h2o 0 81 g 3 33 mmol were dissolved separately in 25 ml of dmf and added dropwise to sba 15 suspended solution the mixture was refluxed in a round bottom flask for 24 h at 135 c under air and then slowly returned to room temperature finally the white solid mil 68 al sba 15 was collected with a centrifuge at 6000 rpm for 10 min and was washed with dmf and methanol several times and air dried at 80 c for two hours the icp oes measurements revealed 30 wt si and 6 wt al for composite 1 and confirmed the experimental si al molar ratio of 2 2 2 4 synthesis of composite 2 mil 68 al sba 15 a control experiment was carried out by synthesizing composite 2 with solid state grinding 26 in a typical synthesis 0 64 g of sba 15 and 0 34 g of mil 68 al the amount of materials used here are based on the obtained icp oes data of composite 1 was ground manually in a mortar for 20 min at room temperature then the resulting mixture was oven dried in air at 100 c for 24 h and was used 2 3 adsorption performance test the adsorption ability of synthesized materials was investigated toward different dye solutions in every experiment 25 mg of the synthesized material was transferred into 50 ml of dye solutions at room temperature the initial concentrations of all dyes were 50 mg l 1 except rhb and cv because of their high adsorption and possible errors in the electronic spectra the low concentration as 25 mg l 1 was used in these experiments after soaking the adsorbents in dye solution for a period ranging from 0 5 60 min 2 ml of the sample was withdrawn at specific time intervals and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min to remove the suspended particles the absorption spectra of the dye solutions were analyzed by uv vis spectroscopy because of the high concentration of dyes and consequent intense absorptions in uv vis spectroscopy all samples were diluted before the analysis the dyes used in this research are methylene blue rhodamine b and crystal violet as cationic dyes and methyl orange alizarin yellow and eriochrome black t as anionic dyes the chemical structures of these dyes are shown in fig s1 electronic supplementary material esm the characteristic wavelengths of different dyes were reported as mb λmax 664 nm cv λmax 588 nm rhb λmax 543 nm mo λmax 464 nm ay λmax 362 nm and ebt λmax 540 nm the linear relationship between the concentration of dye solution and absorbance for all of the selected dyes was obtained the percentage of dye removal r and the adsorption capacity q mg g 1 were calculated using the eqs 1 and 2 1 r c 0 c t c 0 100 2 q t c 0 c t m v where c0 and ct are dye concentrations at the initial time and t time mg l 1 v is the volume of solution l and m is the mass of adsorbent g for the investigation of optimum dosage of the adsorbent for the experiments different dosages of composite 1 5 10 15 20 and 25 mg were used for adsorption of mb solution 50 ml 50 mgl 1 the effect of the initial ph of dye solutions on the adsorption ability of 1 was investigated by mixing 15 mg of composite 1 in dye solutions 50 ml with initial ph of 2 4 6 and 8 the initial ph of the dye solutions was adjusted in a range of 2 8 by adding either hcl or naoh solution 0 1 mol l 1 using a ph meter the adsorption ability of composite 1 was studied for removal of different mixed dye solutions at room temperature for these experiments 25 mg of composite 1 and 50 ml of mixed dye solution were used the initial concentrations of all dyes were 50 mg l 1 except rhb and cv which had concentration of 25 mg l 1 the volume ratio of mixed solutions was prepared with volume ratio of 1 1 for binary 1 1 1 for ternary and 1 1 1 1 for quaternary mixed dye solutions in order to study the adsorption kinetics of mb dye onto composite 1 the experiments were carried out under the same operating conditions 25 mg of composite 1 was used for adsorption of 50 ml of mb solution with different concentrations 50 200 mg l 1 at room temperature also for investigation of adsorption isotherms of mb dye onto composite 1 15 mg of composite 1 was used for adsorption of mb solution 50 ml 50 mg l 1 at different temperatures 25 35 45 and 55 c to test the stability and recyclability of composite 1 towards mb solution it was collected and was washed several times with distilled water and ethanol then reused with fresh mb solution this process was repeated for three times also the desorption of mb from mb loaded composite 1 mb composite 1 was evaluated in ethanol with different ph 2 4 6 and 8 2 4 materials characterizations infrared spectra were measured with bomem mb series ft ir spectrometer electronic spectra of samples were obtained with shimadzu uv 2100 spectrophotometer x ray diffraction xrd patterns of prepared materials were analyzed by a stoe diffractometer darmstadt germany using cu kα radiation λ 1 5406 å from a copper anode tube operating at 40 kv and 40 ma zeta potentials of samples were recorded on zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments ltd uk at 298 k and ph 6 the morphologies of the compounds were observed using a tescan mira3 field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem brno czech republic equipped with an energy dispersive x ray analyzer link tem images of composite 1 were observed by a philips cm30 tem eindhoven netherlands operating at 300 kv the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were measured with belsorp mini ii instrument osaka japan at 77 k and the specific surface areas were calculated according to the bet method the pore size and total pore volume of samples were calculated by the bjh method before doing the measurement mil 68 al and composite 1 were degassed at 403 k for 8 h the silicon and aluminum content in 1 was determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy conducted on the espectro arcos spectrometer ametek us 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization the mil 68 al sba 15 composites 1 and 2 were successfully synthesized and characterized by ft ir xrd edx sem tem bet bjh icp and zeta potential ft ir spectroscopy and xrd confirmed the successful synthesis of the materials fig 1 a and b as the ft ir spectrum of sba 15 in fig 1 a shows the characteristic oh stretching vibrations of the silanol groups appeared at 3440 cm 1 and the typical asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration bands of si o si were assigned at 1080 and 804 cm 1 27 28 the ft ir spectrum of mil 68 al showed a broad band around 3425 cm 1 which belonged to the free water oh stretching vibrations and two weak bands at 2940 and 2870 cm 1 which were assigned to the ch stretching vibrations in addition sharp bands at 1612 1411 and 756 cm 1 were attributed to the stretching vibration of co cc bonds and the hydroxyl groups of the corner sharing octahedral alo4 oh 2 respectively 24 25 similarly the ft ir spectrum of composite 1 displayed the characteristic bands correspond to sba 15 and mil 68 al with some shifts to lower energy specifically the sharp band at 1087 cm 1 unambiguously confirmed the presence of sba 15 onto composite 1 the ft ir spectrum of composite 2 is shown in fig s2a the spectrum also displayed similar bands to the ft ir spectrum of composite 1 the powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the synthesized materials are shown in fig 1b in the xrd pattern of sba 15 the diffraction observed at 2θ 1 56 corresponded to the reflection of 100 plane and it was indexed to the ordered hexagonal pore arrays in the silica 22 23 27 28 in the xrd pattern of mil 68 al characteristic diffractions were observed at 2θ 4 96 9 28 10 0 15 52 18 52 and 21 16 which confirmed the successful synthesis of mof 24 25 notably the xrd pattern of 1 showed diffractions of both sba 15 and mil 68 al without any impurities which were somewhat shifted in comparison with mil 68 al moreover in the xrd pattern of 1 the diffractions of sba 15 were displayed in the same position as the parent sba 15 whereas the intensity of the mil 68 al peaks in pattern decreased to some extent by incorporation into the sba 15 channels it would be interesting to compare the xrd diffraction pattern of composite 1 with the xrd pattern of composite 2 the xrd pattern of the composite 2 fig s2b esi similar to the xrd pattern of composite 1 showed a sharp diffraction at 2θ 1 8 which was associated with sba 15 and several weak diffractions at 2θ 4 48 9 4 and 16 54 which corresponded to mil 68 al the very weak diffractions of 2 could be attributed to the low crystallinity of mil 68 al in the composite the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the activated mil 68 al sba 15 and 1 are illustrated in fig 2 and their surface areas and porosities are listed in table 1 the sorption isotherm of sba 15 revealed a reversible type iv with an h1 hysteresis loop suggesting a mesoporous structure according to the iupac classification moreover the h1 hysteresis loop is characteristic of uniform cylindrical channels 27 29 the bet surface area of sba 15 was calculated as 797 m2 g 1 which was somewhat higher than the value reported for this material in the literature 27 28 29 the pore size and the total pore volume of sba 15 were determined using the bjh method as 5 89 nm and 1 17 cm3 g 1 respectively in contrast the adsorption desorption isotherm of mil 68 al exhibited type i sorption behavior with bet surface area of 974 m2 g 1 a pore size of 2 51 nm and a total pore volume of 0 61 cm3 g 1 30 the sharp increase in the nitrogen adsorption isotherm of mil 68 al in the low pressure region suggested the micropores structure of this mof interestingly for composite 1 the n2 adsorption desorption measurements revealed a hybrid of type i and iv isotherms indeed the bet surface area of 947 m2 g 1 and the pore size of 2 81 nm and the total pore volume of 0 66 cm3 g 1 from the bjh calculations were found for the composite 1 as shown in table 1 the comparison of the textural parameters of composite 1 with those of sba 15 and mil 68 al indicated that by incorporating sba 15 and mil 68 al in the form of composite the pore size of the mesoporous silica decreased from 5 89 nm to 2 81 nm and the surface area increased from 797 to 947 m2 g 1 these significant changes in the textural properties could be attributed to the crystallization of mil 68 al inside the channels of sba 15 also the surface charge of the samples was measured at ph 6 as shown in fig s3 sba 15 mil 68 al and composite 1 have negatively charged surface with zeta potentials of 45 3 38 5 and 42 0 mv respectively it reveals the composite 1 has the moderate zeta potential in comparison with sba 15 and mil 68 al the morphology and chemical compositions of mil 68 al sba 15 and the composites 1 and 2 were determined by sem analyses and the images are presented in fig 3 the sem images show well distributed hexagonal particles with relatively uniform sizes arranged in a rope like morphology in sba 15 27 29 and rod like crystals in mil 68 al with comparatively smooth surfaces similar to the those reported in literature 25 30 the rod like particles were aggregated to some extent which was due to the size of the nanoscale particles interestingly the sem image exhibits a rope like morphology for composite 1 similar to sba 15 but with some aggregation considering that the morphologies of composite 1 and the sba 15 particles were similar and there were no rod like particles of mil 68 al as shown in the sem image we concluded that mil 68 al was successfully crystallized inside the channels of sba 15 however the presence of both rope and rod morphologies in the sem image of composite 2 suggests that in the preparation of the composite using the solid state grinding method the mof particles did not crystallize inside the sba 15 channels the edx spectra of mil 68 al sba 15 and composites 1 and 2 which are displayed in fig s4 showed si and o in sba 15 whereas c o and al in mil 68 al and the combination of these elements were shown in composites 1 and 2 it should be mentioned that although we used the same al si ratios in the preparation of both composites the edx analysis revealed a higher al si ratio in composite 2 than in composite 2 the higher al si ratio in the structure of composite 2 was probably due to the crystallization of mil 68 al inside the mesoporous silica which made it hydrolytically stable in contrast because mil 68 al in composite 2 was not supported inside the silica according to the sem analysis it became hydrolytically unstable and the al si ratio was decreased as the tem images of composite 1 in fig 4 a shows the rod like particles of mil 68 al were accommodated inside the rope like channels of sba 15 fig 4b c shows a well organized periodic hexagonal mesostructure which was formed by alternating channels in the silica walls and filled by mil 68 al based on the tem images we concluded that mil 68 al crystallized inside the channels of sba 15 which may have stabilized mof similarly most of the sba 15 pores were occupied by mil 68 al and no individual mil 68 al crystals were visible outside the sba 15 3 2 adsorption of organic dyes 3 2 1 effect of adsorbent dosage and initial ph of dye solutions on the adsorption ability of composite 1 the adsorbent dosage is a vital factor that affects the efficiency of the materials different dosage of composite 1 was used for adsorption of mb solution 50 ml 50 mg l 1 and their uv vis spectra are inserted in fig s5 the illustrated results in fig 5 show that using 5 or 10 mg of adsorbent was not sufficient to promote extensive dye removal and only 38 and 85 of mb solution was removed in 30 min while using 15 25 mg of composite 1 the mb solution was adsorbed completely in a short time of 10 5 and 0 5 min respectively by increasing the dosage of adsorbent the available sites increase which caused adsorption of dye molecules in a short time with high efficiency according to results using 25 mg of composite 1 show the best result for adsorption of mb solution the initial ph of the dye solution is another important parameter that affects adsorption performance because of the changes in the surface charge and binding sites of the adsorbent 31 32 for investigations of ph the experiments were carried out using composite 1 for adsorption of cationic dye solutions with initial ph solution ranging 2 8 the adsorption of the mb solution onto composite 1 was completed in 1 1 10 and 0 5 min at ph of 2 4 6 and 8 respectively fig 6 a these results indicate that composite 1 could be an effective adsorbent in removing of mb solution at a wide range of ph interestingly according to fig 6b the adsorption capacity of composite 1 increased from 62 93 mg g 1 at ph 6 to115 21 mg g 1 at ph 8 this can be attributed to the basic ph because at a higher ph more deprotonated silanol groups sio exist in the structure of composite 1 which possesses stronger electrostatic interaction with mb as cationic dye 33 notably composite 1 was able to remove rhb solution with an efficiency of 57 80 36 and 73 at ph of 2 4 6 and 8 respectively in a short time of 0 5 20 min according to literature the rhb molecule at a low ph has a positive charge due to the protonation of amino and carboxyl groups in contrast at a high ph the molecule has a negative charge as a result of the hydrolysis of carboxyl groups and the deprotonation of amino groups 34 35 it can be concluded that acidic ph is the optimum ph for the adsorption of rhb molecules onto composite 1 because of the strong electrostatic interactions between the cationic charged rhb molecules and the anionically charged adsorbent the highest adsorption capacity that calculated for adsorption of rhb with composite 1 was 47 13 at ph 4 which decrease to 42 66 and 42 16 at ph 6 and 8 respectively fig 6b furthermore the results revealed that the adsorption efficiency of cv solution onto composite 1 increased from 21 to 58 by increasing the initial ph of the solution from 2 to 8 which suggests the alkaline conditions could be the best ph for adsorption of cv solution 34 36 interestingly by increasing ph from 2 to 4 the adsorption capacity increased from 11 76 to 24 76 mg g 1 and also it increased from 20 56 at ph 6 to 35 66 mg g 1 at ph 8 this is associated with the basic condition in the structure of composite 1 in which the deprotonated silanol groups sio exist and possessed stronger electrostatic interaction with cv molecules with a positive charge 3 2 2 adsorption of single dye solution the prepared materials were used for the adsorption of the methylene blue rhodamine b and crystal violet cationic dyes and the methyl orange alizarin yellow and eriochrome black t anionic dyes and their uv vis spectra of dyes solutions during adsorption are shown in fig 7 for further details the colors of dye solutions before and after adsorption with composite 1 are inserted in fig 7 the composite 1 adsorbed 100 of the mb molecules in a short time of 0 5 min as can be seen in fig 7a the adsorption band of mb dropped sharply to zero and the color of the mb dye solution changed from dark blue to colorless also the composite 1 adsorbed 78 and 65 of rhb and cv solution in 20 min respectively steric hindrance was probably the main barrier to the low adsorption of the large dye molecules and steric hindrance of rhb and cv in compare with mb 33 similarly composite 1 show high adsorption efficiency of 100 for mo and ay dyes molecules in 10 and 1 min respectively while it can adsorb 78 of the ebt dye molecules in 20 min this difference in observed adsorption efficiency of composite 1 is attributed to large dye molecules and more steric hindrance of ebt in compare with mo and ay also the photographs in fig 7a f show the color of dye solutions faded after adsorption by composite 1 to demonstrate that the physical mixture of composite constituents was not effective in adsorption of dyes the composite 2 which was prepared by solid state grinding was used to absorb mb and mo dye solutions and the associated uv vis spectra are depicted in fig s6 the results revealed the composite 2 adsorbed only 78 of mb and 40 of mo dye solutions in 60 min the performance of the composite 2 was poor compared with that of the composite 1 which demonstrate the outstanding ability of the composite 1 toward different dyes to visualize the adsorption of dye molecules by composite 1 at the end of adsorption process the dye loaded composite 1 in bottom of beaker was depicted as can be seen in fig 8 after adsorption of different dyes the white color of the solid composite 1 changed to the color of dyes while the dye solutions become colorless the adsorption ability of bare sba 15 and mil 68 al were evaluated toward the selected dye solutions and comapred with composite 1 the related uv vis spectra are shown in fig s7 the results revealed that sba 15 adsorbed mb rhb and cv molecules with adsorption efficiencies of 91 70 and 82 respectively in 30 min whereas it showed no efficiency towards the anionic dyes however the mil 68 al shows better results it adsorbs 100 of mb 75 of rhb and 53 of the cv dye solution in 15 20 and 20 min respectively moreover it completely adsorbs all of anionic dye solutions in 1 5 min fig s8 the results revealed significant increase in the adsorption efficiency of composite 1 in compare with bare material 3 2 3 adsorption of mixed dyes solutions industrial dye wastewater often contains more than one kind of dyes thus series of mixed dye solutions containing mb rhb cv mo ay and ebt were prepared as model industrial dye wastewater to examine the removal efficiency of the composite 1 of mixed dyes solutions the corresponding uv vis spectra of the adsorption of binary mixed dye solution with composite 1 are shown in fig 9 the composite 1 adsorbed the rhb mb and cv mb cationic mixed dyes solutions in 10 and 5 min and also it adsorbed completely the ay mo and mo ebt anionic mixed dye solutions in 0 5 and 10 min respectively furthermore composite 1 was used for adsorption of cationic and anionic binary mixed dyes solutions such as mo mb and mo rhb as can be seen in fig 9e composite 1 adsorbed mo mb solution completely and the adsorption peaks for mb and mo both dropped to zero after 0 5 min interestingly it visualized by eye that the mo mb mixed solution with the dark green color changed to colorless solution meanwhile the colorless composite 1 turned colorful also composite 1 adsorbed mo rhb mixed dyes solution in 30 min which took a long time in comparison with mo mb solution adsorption the difference in adsorption time can be concluded from the fact that rhb is a dye molecule with a large size and more steric hindrance in comparison with mb the results suggest that the adsorption behavior follows not only a charge but also a size shape exclusion effect in continuation the composite 1 was used for adsorption of ternary mixed dye solutions and their uv vis spectra of dyes solutions during adsorption are illustrated in fig 10 a d the composite 1 adsorbed the ternary mixed dyes solutions named as mo rhb mb ay rhb mb and ay mo mb completely and rapidly in a short time of 5 0 5 0 5 min also composite 1 was used for adsorption of quaternary mixed dyes solution named ay mo rhb mb intriguingly composite 1 was adsorbed dye molecules completely in 0 5 min and the colorful solution turned to a colorless solution without any dye molecules the results confirmed the ultrafast and simultaneous adsorption ability of the composite 1 toward both cationic and anionic dyes solutions suggesting that it could be a highly efficient candidate for the adsorption of dyes pollutants in wastewater 3 2 4 adsorption kinetic the kinetic of mb adsorption onto composite 1 was carried out at different concentrations of mb solution 25 200 mg l 1 and the corresponding uv vis spectra were inserted in fig s9 the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models 32 33 36 were fitted with the experimental data and the calculated parameters are tabulated in table 2 according to the calculated adsorption capacities with pseudo second order model are in good consistent with the experimental data furthermore the comparison of the two correlation coefficients r2 demonstrates that the adsorption process of mb onto composite 1 fits well with the pseudo second order model 3 2 5 adsorption isotherm for studing the adsorption isotherms of mb onto composite 1 the adsorption experiments were evaluated at different temperatures 25 55 c and the related uv vis spectra are shown in fig s10 the linear isotherms of mb adsorption onto composite 1 were investigated by langmuir and freundlich models 32 33 37 38 and the calculated parameters are listed in table 3 based on the r2 values the adsorption equilibrium data can be best fitted by langmuir isotherm this suggests the adsorption of mb occurs at specific homogeneous sites and follows a monolayer adsorption process moreover by increasing the temperature of the adsorption process the amount of adsorption capacity was increased this result suggests the adsorption of mb onto composite 1 was endothermic in addition the separation factor rl defined from the langmuir model in eq 3 can be employed to evaluate the feasibility of adsorption 3 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where kl is the langmuir constant l mg 1 and c0 is the initial mb concentration mg l 1 rl indicates the isotherm shape and predicts that the sorption system is favorable 0 rl 1 or unfavorable rl 1 38 the calculated rl value is 0 016 at 25 c which confirms the conditions applied in this study are favorable from the langmuir model the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated as 62 93 mg g 1 at 25 c it is worth mentioning that the adsorption capacity of composite 1 towards mb solution is higher than most of the previously reported sba 15 based composites 22 39 44 as summarized in table 4 3 2 6 adsorption mechanism the mechanism of adsorption of dye molecules by adsorbent in aqueous solution can be affected by many factors such as textural properties surface chemistry of the adsorbent and type of the presented interactions between the adsorbent and dye molecules such as hydrogen bonding electrostatic attractions π π stacking ion exchange coordination and acid base interaction 45 for a specific adsorption process a variety of interactions might occur at the same time as can be seen in fig 11 a there is a large number of silanol groups si oh on the silica surface 33 also the mil 68 al with the structural formula of alo4 oh 2 contains μ2 oh groups in al o al units which can form hydrogen bonding with nitrogen or oxygen atoms of dye molecules 25 according to the scheme illustrated in fig 11b the hydroxyl groups in composite 1 can interact with the amine groups of the mb molecule with hydrogen bonding in addition π π stacking interaction may also work on mb adsorption due to the interaction of the aromatic rings of dye molecule and mil 68 al 45 in the structure of composite 1 also as can be seen in fig 11c the h bonding between hydroxyl groups of sba 15 and mil 68 al and the π π stacking interaction between the aromatic rings of mil 68 al with mo are the efficient interactions for adsorption of mo molecules onto composite 1 in this work the formation of hydrogen bonding and π π stacking interaction have progressed the adsorption of mb and mo molecules onto composite 1 3 2 7 stability and reusability in adsorbents stability and reusability are essential aspects of their practical application based on economic considerations the regeneration of composite 1 was evaluated by desorption of the mb from the mb loaded composite 1 in ethanol solution with ph in the range of 2 8 their uv vis spectra are illustrated in fig s11 the results revealed that most of the mb molecules desorbed in the basic ph of the ethanol solution and ph 8 had the best results for desorption of the mb molecules from the mb loaded composite 1 the recovered composite was reused with fresh mb solution regarding recyclability the results showed that 90 of the adsorption efficiency was retained after three cycles fig 12a the decrease in adsorption efficiency may have been because part of the adsorbed mb molecules trapped inside the pores of the adsorbent which was due to the presence of strong hydrogen bonding and π π interactions between composite 1 with the dye molecules 25 the stability of recycled composite 1 was evaluated with xrd sem and edx analyses as fig 12b shows the recycled composite 1 had xrd pattern similar to the fresh composite 1 where the xrd pattern of the recycled mil 68 al showed changes compared with the fresh mil 68 al fig s12 these changes may have been associated with the poor hydrostability of mil 68 al the sem and edx results of mb loaded composite 1 are inserted in fig 12c the sem images of it showed a rope like morphology similar to the fresh composite but it appeared somewhat puffy after the adsorption of the dye molecules these images indicated that composite 1 maintained its morphology during the adsorption process furthermore the edx analysis demonstrated the presence of si o al c cl n and s in the mb loaded composite 1 the elements cl n and s were components of the mb molecules which confirmed the adsorption of mb onto composite 1 4 conclusion in summary composite 1 named mil 68 al sba 15 was synthesized by the reflux method the bet and tem analyses confirmed the crystallization of mil 68 al inside the channels of sba 15 the composite 2 mil 68 al sba 15 was synthesized with solid state grinding method and characterized the adsorption ability of the prepared composites 1 and 2 and their components mil 68 al and sba 15 toward different dyes were studied composite 1 exhibited the best adsorption efficiency in the removal of the different dye solutions contain mb rhb cv mo ay and ebt in addition composite 1 adsorbed binary ternary and quaternary mixed dyes solution within a short time the pseudo second order kinetic model and the langmuir isotherm were well fit to the adsorption data of mb onto composite 1 furthermore after three cycles composite 1 maintained its high adsorption ability toward the mb molecules as well as its structural stability in this work composite 1 which consisted of a new material combining mil 68 al and sba 15 mesoporous silica was developed using a facile synthesis method the high adsorption efficiency separation convenience and structural stability of the composite 1 suggest it as a novel composite in water purification applications declaration of competing interest all authors are confirming that there is no conflict of interest of this work

14057,plant barks are among the most widely applied low cost biomass materials in the study of pollutant removal from aqueous media this paper extensively reviews the experimental findings presented in open literature with much focus on the last 15 years this study classified plant bark adsorbents into 5 broad groups based on their preparation technique unmodified biosorbent pre modified biosorbent chemically modified biosorbent physically modified biosorbent and bio based activated carbon it was observed that eucalyptus pine neem acacia and mango are the most explored source species in tree bark adsorption studies about two third of target impurities reported on the subject in open literature have been on heavy metals the review elucidated the excellent adsorption capacities of plant bark based adsorbents and biosorbents for the uptake of heavy metals dyes pesticides and other pollutants adsorption was majorly best fit to either the langmuir or freundlich isotherm models and the pseudo second order kinetic model the thermodynamics findings revealed that the adsorption is highly spontaneous and is by a physical mechanism in most cases it was also observed that plant barks have high reusability potential thereby underlying their usefulness for industrial application knowledge gaps in the research area were also discussed in line with future perspectives keywords adsorption heavy metals environment pollution tree barks 1 introduction industrialisation has increased both the diversity and volume of industrial effluents being released into the environment 1 some modern day industries releasing these effluents are oil refining pharmaceuticals textiles tannery and mining industries amongst others pollutants need to be removed from effluents before release into the ecosystem due to their toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic nature these include dyes 2 4 heavy metals 5 8 and pharmaceutical compounds 9 several technologies are currently in place for the treatment of industrial effluents they include chemical precipitation flotation advanced oxidation processes such as wet air oxidation supercritical water oxidation fenton reagent photocatalytic oxidation ultrasound oxidation electrochemical oxidation ozonation membrane separation processes such as microfiltration ultrafiltration reverse osmosis electrodialysis biological treatment nano filtration membrane distillation hydrogen peroxide treatment adsorption 10 11 and systems with a combination of the listed processes 12 adsorption is a process that has been extensively studied over the years for the removal of toxic pollutants from industrial effluents numerous types of bio materials has been reportedly used as adsorbents among which are agricultural wastes 13 plant leaves 14 15 crab shells 16 chitin and chitosan 17 18 nutshells 19 20 egg shells 21 22 fruit pods 9 23 29 fruit shells 30 31 fish scales 32 34 and a host of others 35 38 however tannin rich plant barks have been found to be one of the most effective adsorbent compared to other bio materials 39 plant barks are among the most widely utilised adsorbents in the study of pollutant removal from aqueous media and numerous studies have been conducted in this regard 40 plants species investigated includes eucalyptus 2 5 6 african border 3 flamboyant pod 9 sycamore 4 pine 7 and many others besides their comparatively low or no cost several advantages abound in using plant barks as precursors for developing adsorbents for water treatment bio materials as adsorbents are eco friendly renewable in nature and require less processing time 5 41 plant bark like most other plant based biomaterials is able accumulate the pollutants from wastewater through passive binding to non living cells via extra cellular and intracellular accumulation and cell surface sorption precipitation hence their suitability as adsorbent for the intended purpose of adsorption this study is an extensive empirical review of the use of plant barks as an adsorbent in the removal of pollutants such as heavy metals dyes pharmaceuticals and pesticides from aqueous media special focus is paid to experimental methodology and preparation techniques reported in open literature a comprehensive catalogue of empirical findings is presented with the further elucidation of research trends and knowledge gaps recently adeniyi and ighalo 14 reviewed the empirical findings on plant leaves biosorption a similar report on plant barks is unavailable in open literature this study is aimed on plugging this gap and providing a trustworthy compilation of results all in one place the data for this study was obtained using the same approach by adeniyi and ighalo 14 the authors conducted an exhaustive search on google scholar on paper published on the subject over the last 15 years it can furthermore serve as a valuable reference point and guide for other researchers seeking guidance in exploring research avenues in plant bark biosorption the convention of this paper was to refer to the plant species by their botanical names however in cases were generic names were used to refer to the plant species the convention of the journal article is retained the botanical names being used alone indicate the material is a biosorbent else ac is added to indicate it is an activated carbon the interest of this paper is from an empirical stand point 2 source and preparation techniques 2 1 plant species over the years numerous plants species have served as source of plant barks for the preparation of biosorbent as revealed by fig 1 some of the species whose bark have been regularly valorised for the preparation of activated carbons and biosorbents for adsorption studies are eucalyptus pine neem acacia and mango this is assisted by their ability to thrive in many regions across the world with about 35 of the studies evaluating a vast array of other plants we can observe that studies have not just focused on the popular plant species alone if juxtaposed with fig 2 it can be put forward that eucalyptus pine neem acacia and mango are studied more extensively this is because they are more popular in asia and africa where a good portion of plant bark biosorption studies originate besides these continent possess large tropical regions suitable for the existence of some of these trees a comprehensive catalogue of plant species whose bark has been investigated as adsorbents and biosorbents is presented in table 1 the data was sourced from an exhaustive search on google scholar on studies in this regard over the last 20 years from fig 2 it can be observed that india has been the hub of almost half the major studies on plant bark adsorption in the past 15 years a similar observation was made by adeniyi and ighalo 14 for plant leaves biosorption nigeria is also quite interested with plant back adsorption it can be observed that there is conspicuously less interest from most other developed part of the world like the us and most of europe in these nations research in water treatment is more focused on other technologies adsorption is comparatively cheaper than most of these technologies hence an enviable route for developing countries due to their lesser economic strength and countries with large urban population furthermore adeniyi and ighalo 14 opined that such interest in adsorption by these countries is due to their long standing issues with water pollution over population and management of industrial effluents compared to other developed countries 2 2 preparation techniques preparation of adsorbents from plants barks is a relatively simple technique in this sub section the experimental methodologies presented in open literature is reviewed based on the varieties of techniques used in preparing the adsorbents we classify the adsorbent into 5 groups i unmodified biosorbent ii pre modified biosorbent iii chemically modified biosorbent iv physically modified biosorbent v bio based activated carbon when no reagent is used at the initial washing stage and no further treatment is done on the adsorbent powder the end product is an unmodified biosorbent when some form of chemical treatment is applied alongside the washing stage we can refer to it as a pre modified biosorbent for both the unmodified and pre modified biosorbent if a further chemical activation step is conducted it is considered as a modified biosorbent if the modification treatment technique is physical steaming or boiling then the product can be referred to as a physically modified biosorbent in carbonisation process the biomaterials are sent into a furnace to obtain bio based activated carbon fig 3 gives a summary of the preparation process and how the 5 groups of adsorbents are arrived at tables 2 and 3 presents the preparation techniques and modification techniques respectively for plant bark adsorbents reported in open literature the plants barks are sourced then washed with distilled 2 5 59 64 115 118 double distilled 58 101 deionised 44 66 69 79 91 105 or permuted water 53 62 109 110 the purpose is to remove dust dirt and other attached substances from the plant barks in some reports other chemicals are used as a pre modification step and these includes sodium hydroxide 53 70 72 90 93 nitric acid 45 46 sulphuric acid 72 hydrochloric acid 87 90 93 or some combination of them these reagents are used in pre modification not only to improve the adsorbent surface properties but to help improve the efficiency of leaching out soluble substances colours and tannins moisture is then removed from the barks by oven drying 2 5 90 109 110 sun drying 44 80 92 97 or drying in the shade at ambient air conditions 45 46 58 59 94 sun drying takes longer time because the process temperature is lower and vice versa for oven drying oven temperatures and time are widely varying in literature but it ranges between 4 h to 4 days and temperatures are between 60 105 c the sample is then grinded by a plethora of techniques as shown in table 2 and sieved to obtain varying sizes this product can be used as an adsorbent or sent for further modification to improve the adsorption properties 2 3 modification techniques fig 4 reveals that over 50 of plant bark adsorption studies within the domain of the empirical review opted for further modification treatment of the biosorbent this trend can be attributed to the premise that surface area improvement is not as important as it seems when biosorption not just adsorption alone is involved the mechanisms of extra cellular and intracellular accumulation and trapping of pollutants within interstitials on the macro molecular matrix do not depend only on surface area but on particle affinity and functional complexes on the particle surface only one study reported the use of a physical modification technique in improving the adsorption properties of the plant bark powder 101 a popular technique of modification is by the use of acids acids utilised include nitric acid 45 60 88 102 104 sulphuric acid 95 115 118 and hydrochloric acid 47 66 94 the acid activates increase the micro porosity of the biosorbents thereby increasing the surface area 141 on the other hand formaldehyde polymerises and insolubilizes the tannin and pectins present in the biosorbent the process is usually accompanied by heating and stirring for an extended period of time in some studies alkali usually naoh was utilised to hydrolyse the sample instead of acids 2 5 68 while others used a combination of both 76 77 119 modification has also been done by elaborate multi staged processes 89 105 for carbonisation chemical activation has been reportedly done by the wet impregnation of zncl2 4 42 h2so4 108 or k2co3 83 the carbonisation is usually above 400 c the impregnated activation agent generates gaseous chemical species in the furnace which create numerous pores within the material as they escape from the carbon matrix thereby creating a highly porous adsorbent with large surface area the products of carbonisation and chemical modification are usually washed with treated water some studies have incorporated acids 4 42 83 and or base 4 47 66 solution while washing to assist in taking the ph back to neutral and leaching out any foreign chemical species a comprehensive list of the modification techniques is presented in table 3 2 4 effect of modification on surface area in some studies branueur emmet teller bet analysis was conducted to determine the specific surface area of the biosorbent surface area is one of the important property of an adsorbent and plant bark biosorbents have a relativity small surface area this is similar to most other plant biomaterials like leaves 14 as earlier stated the adsorbent and biosorbent do not show full dependence on surface area as extra cellular accumulation and interactions with functional complexes on the adsorbent also play a part therefore despite the relatively low specific surface area of the biosorbents shown in table 4 adsorption capacities for pollutant species are still quite high it can also be observed from table 4 that chemical modification actually improves the specific surface of the adsorbent albeit to a little extent surface area of commercial activated carbons are very high and can be in the range of 700 1400 m2 g activated carbons from plant barks shown in table 4 are also as high especially for melaleuca cajuputi 42 sycamore 4 and hymenaea courbaril 83 3 target impurities for plant bark derived biosorbents about two third of target impurities reported in open literature have been on heavy metals as revealed by fig 5 other pollutants include dyes pharmaceuticals and pesticides albeit with significantly more interest in dyes than the latter two adsorption procedures are usually done in batch systems for empirical studies experiments are performed in glass stoppered erlenmeyer flasks in most cases a known volume of polluted aqueous solution is introduced into the flask a weighed amount of biosorbent is added to the water to form a solution of known concentration or dosage the ph of the solution can be adjusted by small volumes of strong acids and bases and then measured with a ph meter agitation can be achieved by an incubator shaker or centrifuge agitation speed and temperature can be set on the device the experiment is terminated at a known time and adsorbent filtered out with a filter paper the key performance parameters in adsorption are the amount of pollutants adsorbed and the removal efficiency determination of amount adsorbent and removal efficiency is by simple mathematical correlations the amount of pollutant adsorbed can be determined by the expression below in eq 1 1 q v c i c e m where q is the amount of pollutant adsorbed mg g ci is the initial concentration of pollutants mg l and ce is the concentration of pollutants mg l at equilibrium v is the volume of solution l and m is the mass of the adsorbent used m the removal efficiency can be determined by the expression below in eq 2 2 q c i c e c i 100 all parameters have been previously defined 3 1 heavy metals the term heavy metal is entirely applied to a group of metals and metal like elements with density greater than 5 g cm³ atomic number above 20 and is toxic or poisonous at low concentrations 142 examples of elements that considered as a heavy metals includes lead pb chromium cr manganese mn cobalt co nickel ni copper cu zinc zn molybdenum mo mercury hg tin sn cadmium cd antimony sb among others there are three 3 classes of heavy metals that are of concern to environmental scientists and engineers toxic metals such as hg cr pb zn cu ni cd as co sn etc precious metals such as pd pt ag au ru etc and radionuclides such as u th ra etc 142 143 fig 6 informs that cadmium chromium nickel lead and copper are the most studied heavy metals in adsorption studies utilising plant barks lead mercury and cadmium are considered as the most toxic heavy metals and they are sometimes called the big three due to their major adverse impact on the environment 142 heavy metals cannot be destroyed disintegrated digested or degraded by any simple chemical means at low concentration toxicity might be low but these heavy metals become quite toxic at higher concentrations due to their ability to accumulate in living tissues table 5 presents a list of the maximum reported adsorption capacities of different species of plant bark derived adsorbents to different heavy metals as sourced from open literature it can be observed that plant barks have high adsorption capacities for heavy metals though with exceptions a number of factors play important roles in determining the adsorption capacity and these include the nature of the plant material the nature of the chemical modification the nature of the heavy metals species and the solution ph and temperature several studies have compared plant bark biosorbents with other materials due to the differences in experimental methodology and adsorbent modification technique the comparison of the adsorption capacity discussed below will be done only based on findings of the same study and not across different studies park et al 137 observed that biochar from pine bark has a higher adsorption capacity for cd ii 85 8 mg g compared to biochar obtained from other pine residues like the cone 40 8 mg g and the needle 53 8 mg g the shift in the cc functional groups in the biochar surface indicated interaction with cd ii forming cd ii π bonds the ch and co functional groups were also observed to take part in the adsorption in terms of the solution chemistry the adsorption was not favoured at very ow ph due to competition with hydrogen ions at high ph the cd formed hydroxides optimum ph was between 5 and 8 this kind of solution chemistry effect where optimum adsorption is achieved at near neutrality is similar for other heavy metals mohan et al 134 observed that the adsorption capacity of adsorbent prepared from mango bark for as3 1 25 mg g was slightly higher than sugarcane bagasse 1 08 mg g and slightly lesser than guava leaf 1 35 mg g however on the bigger perspective the adsorption capacities observed by mohan et al 134 is lesser than for most other plant bark adsorption studies koetlisi and muchaonyerwa 130 observed that the sorption capacity of pine bark biochar for cr was higher than for biochar from sewage sludge and latrine faecal waste however the sorption capacity was the least of the three adsorbents for both zn ii and cu ii koetlisi and muchaonyerwa 130 attributed these differences to the affinity of the biochar to the respective heavy metals the major mechanism of adsorption for the heavy metals was via complexation with the functional groups on the surface of the adsorbents villaescusa et al 117 observed that adsorbent prepared form yohimbe bark have higher sorption capacity for both cu ii and ni ii compared to adsorbent from cork waste vasudevan et al 116 observed that the sorption capacity of adsorbent from rubber tree bark for cr vi 43 86 mg g was less than for adsorbent from cassava peels 79 37 mg g 3 2 other pollutants other pollutants considered in plant derived adsorbent studies are dyes pharmaceuticals and pesticides dyes studied include methylene blue methyl red methyl orange congo red solar blue remazol amongst others in practice numerous pharmaceutical compounds like ibuprofen ketoprofen amoxicillin naproxen and diclofenac have been proven to be pollutants in aqueous system 145 146 pesticides that have been studied includes atrazine imidacloprid lindane and heptachlor the plant bark derived adsorbents have all shown excellent adsorption capacities for these pollutants and removal efficiencies are especially good as revealed by table 6 however not much can be drawn from the removal efficiency as this depends greatly on the pollutant concentration and adsorbent dosage several studies have compared plant bark biosorbents with other materials the comparison of the adsorption capacity discussed below will be done only based on findings of the same study and not across different studies due to the differences in experimental methodology and adsorbent modification technique the study by pang et al 136 observed that the adsorption capacity of adsorbent prepared from araucaria bark for crystal violet 65 23 mg g at 25 c was the least when compared to adsorbents obtained from pecan nutshell 84 08 mg g para chestnut husk 84 31 mg g and palm cactus 78 17 mg g in a comparative study satish et al 104 evaluated the fluoride sorption capacities of almond tree bark powder against mangrove plant leaf powder pineapple peel powder chiku leaf powder toor plant leaf powder and coconut coir pith the fluoride sorption capacity of almond tree bark powder 1 403 mg g was intermediate when compared to those of mangrove plant leaf powder 2 183 mg g pineapple peel powder 1 266 mg g chiku leaf powder 1 818 mg g toor plant leaf powder 2 151 mg g and coconut coir pith 1 522 mg g 4 plant bark adsorption equilibrium we will proceed to give a brief theoretical background to these isotherms so the results presented in the tables 7 and 8 can be easily understood more extensive information on many more of these isotherms are obtainable in open literature 8 81 the langmuir isotherm model 147 represents one of the first theoretical treatments of nonlinear sorption and suggests that uptake occurs on a homogeneous surface by monolayer sorption without interaction between adsorbed molecules in addition the model assumes uniform energies of adsorption onto the surface and no transmigration of the adsorbate the langmuir monolayer sorption isotherm is based on three assumptions 14 assumption 1 the solid surface presents a finite number of energetically uniform identical sites assumption 2 no interaction exists among adsorbed species i e the amount adsorbed has no influence on the adsorption rate assumption 3 a monolayer is formed when the solid surface reaches saturation each active site were occupied by one particle the general langmuir equation is commonly presented as eq 3 3 q e q m a x b c e 1 b c e and the equation may be linearised as follows in eq 4 4 c e q e 1 q m a x b c e q m a x where qe is the amount of pollutant removed mg g ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l b is the langmuir constant related to affinity and qmax mg g is the maximum pollutant uptake under the given conditions 148 the freundlich isotherm 149 is a nonlinear sorption model which proposes a multilayer sorption with a heterogeneous energetic distribution of active sites accompanied by interactions between adsorbed molecules the freundlich multilayer sorption isotherm is based on three assumptions 14 assumption 1 the uptake of ions occurs on a heterogeneous surface by multilayer adsorption assumption 2 the amount of adsorbate adsorbed increases infinitely with an increase in concentration assumption 3 the stronger binding sites are occupied first and the binding strength decreases with increasing degree of site occupation the general form of this model is given in eq 5 5 q e k f c e 1 n and the equation may be linearised as follows in eq 6 6 l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e where qe is the amount of pollutant removed mg g and ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l kf mg g and n are the freundlich constant and they are related to the sorption capacity and the sorption intensity respectively n value greater than 1 0 shows that the sorption is a favorable physical process 148 temkin isotherm model 150 evaluates that the adsorption heat of all molecules decreases linearly with the increase in coverage of the adsorbent surface the general form of this model is given in eq 7 7 q e r t b i n α c e and the equation may be linearised as follows in eq 8 8 q e β i n α β i n c e where 9 β r t b r is the universal gas constant 8 314 mol k and t is the temperature k also α is the temkin isotherm constant equilibrium binding constant l mol corresponding to the maximum binding energy b is the temkin constant related to the adsorption heat from tables 7 and 8 the reported best fit equilibrium models for plant bark adsorption of heavy metals and other pollutants were langmuir freundlich and temkin models however plant bark adsorption and biosorption was best fit to either langmuir or freundlich in most of the cases we can furthermore utilise the postulates of the langmuir isotherm to gain a proper insight into the nature of the adsorption process for langmuir best fits the pollutants sorption onto the active sites approximates a monolayer whilst multilayer assumptions hold for freundlich best fits in general other factors such as the adsorbent pore size and pollutant size plays a great role in determining if the adsorption process is monolayer or multilayer akar et al 120 studied the sorption of cr vi and ni ii onto both modified and unmodified platanus orientalis bark they fitted only langmuir isotherm to their experimental data albeit with a high coefficient of determination the monolayer adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for ni ii was 126 6 and 285 7 mg g for unmodified and modified and for cr vi was 13 4 and 19 2 mg g for unmodified and modified respectively though adsorbents were better suited for ni ii uptake it was also observed that modification with nitric acid helped improve the performance of the adsorbent for the uptake of cr iii onto pinus pinaster bark arim et al 121 observed langmuir isotherm as best fit with an rmse of 0 914 at an initial metal concentration of 250 mg l devi and mishra 123 fitted the data of the equilibrium adsorption of dysprosium iii onto naoh modified mangifera indica bark they also observed that the langmuir isotherm model was the best fit hence the sorption approximates monolayer georgin et al 125 observed the langmuir isotherm as best fit for the sorption of red 97 dye onto cedrella fissilis bark 5 plant bark adsorption kinetics we will proceed to give a brief theoretical background to these kinetic models so the results presented in the tables can be easily understood more extensive information on other kinetics are obtainable in open literature 8 81 pseudo first order kinetic model assumes that sorption process is first order in nature as it is only dependent on the number of metal ions present at the specific time in the solution 151 pseudo first order or lagergren can be presented as shown in eq 10 10 d q d t k 1 q e q q this then gives us eq 11 11 l o g q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t where k1 min 1 is the rate constant of the pseudo first order adsorption model and qe and qt mg g are the amounts of compound adsorbed onto adsorbent at equilibrium and at any time t min respectively qe and k1 can be calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot of log q e qt versus t pseudo second order kinetic model assumes that the adsorption process is dependent on the number of pollutant ions present in the solution as well as the free adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface 152 pseudo second order model can be presented as shown in eq 12 12 d q d t k 2 q e q q 2 this then gives us eq 13 13 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the rate constant of the pseudo second order adsorption model mg 1 min 1 qe and k2 can be calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot of t q versus t intra particle diffusion model propounds that instantaneous adsorption occurs in the first step the second stage is the gradual adsorption stage where intra particle diffusion is controlled and the final step is the equilibrium step where the solute moves slowly from larger pore to micro pores 153 intra particle diffusion model can be presented as shown in eq 14 14 q t k d i f t 0 5 c where c is a constant which gives information about the thickness of boundary layer and k mg gmin0 5 is the intra particle diffusion rate constant 154 from tables 9 and 10 the kinetics of plant bark adsorption and biosorption is majorly pseudo second order though some studies reported first order and intra particle diffusion as best fit furthermore we can then use the postulates of the pseudo second order kinetics to gain a proper understanding of the adsorption process it can be surmised that for plant bark sorption pollutant uptake is dependent on both the number of ions present in the solution as well as the free sites on the adsorbent surface the kinetics of cr iii uptake onto pinus pinaster bark was studied by arim et al 121 they observed the pseudo second order kinetic model as best fit with an rmse of 0 236 at an initial metal concentration of 250 mg l georgin et al 125 observed that both the pseudo second order kinetic model and the general order kinetic model as best fit for the sorption of red 97 dye onto cedrella fissilis bark ghosh and mondal 126 observed that the sorption of fluoride onto aluminium modified eucalyptus bark was best fit to the pseudo first order model in such a system it can be assumed that only the concentration of metal ions in the system controls the kinetics and not the amount of active sites present on the adsorbent 6 thermodynamic studies the thermodynamic study of adsorption process of pollutants on plant bark derived adsorbents is usually carried out to estimate the feasibility of the adsorption process the gibbs free energy change δ g values can discern whether a process is spontaneous negative values of δ g imply a spontaneous process the enthalpy change δ h provides information about the exothermic or endothermic nature of the process and differentiate between physical and chemical adsorption process the entropy change δ s predicts the magnitude of changes in the reversibility which is affected in its negative values obtained the change in gibbs free energy δ g is given by eq 15 15 δ g r t i n k where r is the universal gas constant t is the temperature in kelvin and k is equilibrium constant van t hoff equation allows obtaining values of enthalpy δ h and entropy δ s the equation is obtained from the free energy equation as follows in eq 16 16 δ g δ h t δ s equating the two expressions for δ g above we have eq 17 17 r t i n k δ h t δ s making i n k the subject of the formulae we obtain the van t hoff equation 18 i n k δ s r δ h r t tables 11 and 12 presents a summary of the empirical thermodynamic findings presented in open literature for plant bark adsorption studies it can observed that most studies reported a negative value of gibbs free energy change δ g this is proof that the adsorption and biosorption of pollutants by plant barks from most pollutant species is highly spontaneous the enthalpy change δ h informs that the sorption process is mainly exothermic for heavy metals and mainly endothermic for other pollutants though with exceptions for an endothermic process high temperature will favour adsorption while for exothermic process low temperatures will favour adsorption the magnitude of the enthalpy change δ h gives us an idea of the type of sorption physical adsorption is usually less than 20 kj mol while chemical adsorption is usually above 80 kj mol from tables 11 and 12 we see that most tree bark adsorption is physical in nature with a few studies being intermediate between both mechanisms the entropy can be used to obtain preliminary insight into the degree of disorderliness of the system a number of the entropy change are positive thereby suggesting an inherent affinity of the adsorbent to those chemical species furthermore these positive entropy change values suggest an increase in the degree of freedom of the adsorbate the negative entropy change observed by argun and dursun 50 chockalingam and subramanian 52 kamari and ngah 66 khosla et al 70 satish et al 104 and munagapati et al 90 suggests an increased disorder during the adsorption process and that the process is enthalpy driven 7 desorption and regeneration studies in desorption the adsorbate are desorbed from the adsorbent by agitation and the aid of a chemical eluent desorption precedes regeneration reusability studies in reusability assessment a series of adsorption desorption cycles are conducted and the continuous decline in adsorbent performance observed gundogdu et al 63 opined that desorption is only of importance when the adsorbent is very expensive to prepare however desorption studies have been a feature of plant bark adsorption papers in recent times the percentage desorbed can be determined using eq 19 19 d e s o r b e d c a d s o r b e d c d e s o r b e d 100 the c in eq 19 is for concentration in the study by afroze et al 5 it was observed that zn ii desorption from adsorbent prepared from eucalyptus sheathiana bark was less than 15 using hcl as eluent this indicates that there is strong binding affinity and the complexes and ligands formed are quite stable ahmad 43 studied the desorption of crystal violet onto adsorbent prepared from pinus roxberghii bark it was observed that using sodium chloride as eluent 67 5 of the adsorbed dye could be desorbed however this increases to about 90 for a column set up the reverse was observed for acetic acid eluent as the percentage desorbed dropped from 88 to 47 5 from batch to column set up justifications were not given in the study for the observed relationship for the desorption of cd ii from adsorbents prepared from pinus nigra bark the desorption efficiency was greatest when hcl was used as eluent then naoh followed by distilled water 49 the acid is a better eluent because the heavy metal ions cannot compete favourably with the hydrogen ions for adsorption sites which then initiates their release from the adsorbent surface into the solution argun and dursun 49 also observed that only slight losses in adsorption and desorption occurred even after 3 usage cycles for all 3 reagents considered cutillas barreiro et al 7 evaluated the desorption of five different heavy metals from adsorbent prepared from pinus pinaster bark using sodium nitrate as eluent it was observed from the study that pb ii was the most recalcitrant from solution while zn ii was the least recalcitrant for the desorption of pb ii from adsorbent prepared from pinus brutia bark gundogdu et al 63 observed a 90 maximum efficiency when 0 5 m hcl was used lesser concentration of the acid gave lesser desorption efficiency in further reusability studies conducted a 20 drop in the adsorption capacity was observed after the first cycle but the study opined that the adsorbent can be used up to 5 times for the desorption of ni ii from moringa oleifera bark reddy et al 101 observed an optimum desorption efficiency of 98 using 0 3 m hcl as eluent further regeneration studies revealed that the adsorbent can be used for up to 6 cycles before losing a good portion of its adsorption capacity arim et al 121 conducted a very detailed desorption and regeneration study for the recovery cr iii from pinus pinaster bark using a variety of eluent types 2 m sulphuric acid was observed to be the best eluent for the process devi and mishra 123 studied the regeneration of dysprosium iii from naoh modified mangifera indica bark they concluded that the adsorbent can be used up to 3 cycles before significant loss in adsorption capacity in a reusability study conducted by li et al 131 for the sorption of ce iii onto uv induced graft polymerised pine bark it was observed that the adsorbent could be used as much as 8 times it retained an adsorption capacity of about 200 mg g on the eight cycle from the initial 256 5 mg g adsorption capacity for ce iii for the reutilisation of black wattle bark activated carbon for the sorption of phenol lütke et al 132 observed a 60 drop in adsorption capacity by the fifth cycle the adsorbent still had a high capacity even at the third cycle but dropped drastically afterwards for the reutilisation of sulphuric acid modified mangifera indica bark adsorbent for the sorption of holmium iii removal efficiency dropped from 91 7 89 5 after four cycles in general it can be observed that plant barks have high reusability potential thereby underlying their usefulness for industrial application table 13 gives a summary of the empirical findings on the desorption of pollutants from plant barks 8 knowledge gaps and research trend from the review a few gaps have been identified that researchers can investigate to improve our understanding of the process and make the adsorbent more competitive in a world of growing alternatives in adsorption technologies there is a dearth of studies on the optimisation of preparation techniques for plant bark adsorption as observed in the study each paper seemed to develop their own method as deemed fit adeniyi and ighalo 14 also made a similar observation on adsorption and biosorption studies involving plant leaves it has also been noticed that less interest is generally paid to the carbonisation of plant barks and this however gives products with the highest specific surface area a good avenue to explore as regards the research area would be to develop and optimise adsorption systems that make use of plant barks and can have industrial applications adsorption in packed columns is an excellent alternative there is also a dearth of studies on the removal of pharmaceutical compounds pesticides personal care products and other emerging contaminants from aqueous media using the class of adsorbent the use of plant bark biosorbent in remediating polluted wastewaters especially in the domain of chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod and turbidity has not been reported at least within the domain of the authors exhaustive search disposal of used adsorbent into the environment is not advised as it makes the initial purpose of environmental pollution control to be defeated most studies do not discuss the methods or avenues for the disposal of their used adsorbents this will need to be addressed by researchers as it can quickly constitute an issue in cases where the process has been scaled up for industrial applications popular disposal technique is by stabilisation in cementitious material or polymeric resins so as to immobilise the pollutants and prevent leaching in the short term financial analysis is another important area that can be explored by researchers in a recent study arim et al 121 evaluated the cost of developing xanthate modified adsorbent from pinus pinaster they predicted a cost of 0 39 us per kg of the adsorbent which is cheaper than others commercial activated carbons and activated carbon from biomass like sugarcane bagasse 155 similar analysis is encouraged in plant leaves biosorption studies as it is a major area of interest to investors and industrial engineers 9 conclusion several key information was deduced from this empirical review it was observed that eucalyptus pine neem acacia and mango trees are the most explored source species in tree bark adsorption studies interest is interestingly big in countries india and nigeria as these have long standing issues with water pollution over population and management of industrial effluents this review classified plant bark adsorbents into 5 groups with justifications unmodified biosorbent pre modified biosorbent chemically modified biosorbent physically modified biosorbent and bio based activated carbon the review elucidated the excellent adsorption capacities of plant bark based adsorbents and biosorbents for the uptake of heavy metals dyes pesticides and other pollutants plant bark sorption is majorly either best fit to langmuir or freundlich isotherm models the kinetics is majorly pseudo second order the review of thermodynamics findings revealed that the adsorption and biosorption of pollutants by plant barks from most plants is highly spontaneous and is by a physical mechanism in most cases it was also observed that plant barks have high reusability potential thereby underlying their usefulness for industrial application knowledge gaps were also observed and discussed some challenges in the research area are the untested adsorption of pharmaceutical compounds pesticides personal care products and other emerging contaminants the need for the investigation of disposal techniques and cost analysis was also highlighted this review serves as an important aggregator of the progress made in the research domain over the past few years and can furthermore serve as a valuable reference point and guide for other researchers compliance with ethical standards this article does not contain any studies involving human or animal subjects declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest 
14057,plant barks are among the most widely applied low cost biomass materials in the study of pollutant removal from aqueous media this paper extensively reviews the experimental findings presented in open literature with much focus on the last 15 years this study classified plant bark adsorbents into 5 broad groups based on their preparation technique unmodified biosorbent pre modified biosorbent chemically modified biosorbent physically modified biosorbent and bio based activated carbon it was observed that eucalyptus pine neem acacia and mango are the most explored source species in tree bark adsorption studies about two third of target impurities reported on the subject in open literature have been on heavy metals the review elucidated the excellent adsorption capacities of plant bark based adsorbents and biosorbents for the uptake of heavy metals dyes pesticides and other pollutants adsorption was majorly best fit to either the langmuir or freundlich isotherm models and the pseudo second order kinetic model the thermodynamics findings revealed that the adsorption is highly spontaneous and is by a physical mechanism in most cases it was also observed that plant barks have high reusability potential thereby underlying their usefulness for industrial application knowledge gaps in the research area were also discussed in line with future perspectives keywords adsorption heavy metals environment pollution tree barks 1 introduction industrialisation has increased both the diversity and volume of industrial effluents being released into the environment 1 some modern day industries releasing these effluents are oil refining pharmaceuticals textiles tannery and mining industries amongst others pollutants need to be removed from effluents before release into the ecosystem due to their toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic nature these include dyes 2 4 heavy metals 5 8 and pharmaceutical compounds 9 several technologies are currently in place for the treatment of industrial effluents they include chemical precipitation flotation advanced oxidation processes such as wet air oxidation supercritical water oxidation fenton reagent photocatalytic oxidation ultrasound oxidation electrochemical oxidation ozonation membrane separation processes such as microfiltration ultrafiltration reverse osmosis electrodialysis biological treatment nano filtration membrane distillation hydrogen peroxide treatment adsorption 10 11 and systems with a combination of the listed processes 12 adsorption is a process that has been extensively studied over the years for the removal of toxic pollutants from industrial effluents numerous types of bio materials has been reportedly used as adsorbents among which are agricultural wastes 13 plant leaves 14 15 crab shells 16 chitin and chitosan 17 18 nutshells 19 20 egg shells 21 22 fruit pods 9 23 29 fruit shells 30 31 fish scales 32 34 and a host of others 35 38 however tannin rich plant barks have been found to be one of the most effective adsorbent compared to other bio materials 39 plant barks are among the most widely utilised adsorbents in the study of pollutant removal from aqueous media and numerous studies have been conducted in this regard 40 plants species investigated includes eucalyptus 2 5 6 african border 3 flamboyant pod 9 sycamore 4 pine 7 and many others besides their comparatively low or no cost several advantages abound in using plant barks as precursors for developing adsorbents for water treatment bio materials as adsorbents are eco friendly renewable in nature and require less processing time 5 41 plant bark like most other plant based biomaterials is able accumulate the pollutants from wastewater through passive binding to non living cells via extra cellular and intracellular accumulation and cell surface sorption precipitation hence their suitability as adsorbent for the intended purpose of adsorption this study is an extensive empirical review of the use of plant barks as an adsorbent in the removal of pollutants such as heavy metals dyes pharmaceuticals and pesticides from aqueous media special focus is paid to experimental methodology and preparation techniques reported in open literature a comprehensive catalogue of empirical findings is presented with the further elucidation of research trends and knowledge gaps recently adeniyi and ighalo 14 reviewed the empirical findings on plant leaves biosorption a similar report on plant barks is unavailable in open literature this study is aimed on plugging this gap and providing a trustworthy compilation of results all in one place the data for this study was obtained using the same approach by adeniyi and ighalo 14 the authors conducted an exhaustive search on google scholar on paper published on the subject over the last 15 years it can furthermore serve as a valuable reference point and guide for other researchers seeking guidance in exploring research avenues in plant bark biosorption the convention of this paper was to refer to the plant species by their botanical names however in cases were generic names were used to refer to the plant species the convention of the journal article is retained the botanical names being used alone indicate the material is a biosorbent else ac is added to indicate it is an activated carbon the interest of this paper is from an empirical stand point 2 source and preparation techniques 2 1 plant species over the years numerous plants species have served as source of plant barks for the preparation of biosorbent as revealed by fig 1 some of the species whose bark have been regularly valorised for the preparation of activated carbons and biosorbents for adsorption studies are eucalyptus pine neem acacia and mango this is assisted by their ability to thrive in many regions across the world with about 35 of the studies evaluating a vast array of other plants we can observe that studies have not just focused on the popular plant species alone if juxtaposed with fig 2 it can be put forward that eucalyptus pine neem acacia and mango are studied more extensively this is because they are more popular in asia and africa where a good portion of plant bark biosorption studies originate besides these continent possess large tropical regions suitable for the existence of some of these trees a comprehensive catalogue of plant species whose bark has been investigated as adsorbents and biosorbents is presented in table 1 the data was sourced from an exhaustive search on google scholar on studies in this regard over the last 20 years from fig 2 it can be observed that india has been the hub of almost half the major studies on plant bark adsorption in the past 15 years a similar observation was made by adeniyi and ighalo 14 for plant leaves biosorption nigeria is also quite interested with plant back adsorption it can be observed that there is conspicuously less interest from most other developed part of the world like the us and most of europe in these nations research in water treatment is more focused on other technologies adsorption is comparatively cheaper than most of these technologies hence an enviable route for developing countries due to their lesser economic strength and countries with large urban population furthermore adeniyi and ighalo 14 opined that such interest in adsorption by these countries is due to their long standing issues with water pollution over population and management of industrial effluents compared to other developed countries 2 2 preparation techniques preparation of adsorbents from plants barks is a relatively simple technique in this sub section the experimental methodologies presented in open literature is reviewed based on the varieties of techniques used in preparing the adsorbents we classify the adsorbent into 5 groups i unmodified biosorbent ii pre modified biosorbent iii chemically modified biosorbent iv physically modified biosorbent v bio based activated carbon when no reagent is used at the initial washing stage and no further treatment is done on the adsorbent powder the end product is an unmodified biosorbent when some form of chemical treatment is applied alongside the washing stage we can refer to it as a pre modified biosorbent for both the unmodified and pre modified biosorbent if a further chemical activation step is conducted it is considered as a modified biosorbent if the modification treatment technique is physical steaming or boiling then the product can be referred to as a physically modified biosorbent in carbonisation process the biomaterials are sent into a furnace to obtain bio based activated carbon fig 3 gives a summary of the preparation process and how the 5 groups of adsorbents are arrived at tables 2 and 3 presents the preparation techniques and modification techniques respectively for plant bark adsorbents reported in open literature the plants barks are sourced then washed with distilled 2 5 59 64 115 118 double distilled 58 101 deionised 44 66 69 79 91 105 or permuted water 53 62 109 110 the purpose is to remove dust dirt and other attached substances from the plant barks in some reports other chemicals are used as a pre modification step and these includes sodium hydroxide 53 70 72 90 93 nitric acid 45 46 sulphuric acid 72 hydrochloric acid 87 90 93 or some combination of them these reagents are used in pre modification not only to improve the adsorbent surface properties but to help improve the efficiency of leaching out soluble substances colours and tannins moisture is then removed from the barks by oven drying 2 5 90 109 110 sun drying 44 80 92 97 or drying in the shade at ambient air conditions 45 46 58 59 94 sun drying takes longer time because the process temperature is lower and vice versa for oven drying oven temperatures and time are widely varying in literature but it ranges between 4 h to 4 days and temperatures are between 60 105 c the sample is then grinded by a plethora of techniques as shown in table 2 and sieved to obtain varying sizes this product can be used as an adsorbent or sent for further modification to improve the adsorption properties 2 3 modification techniques fig 4 reveals that over 50 of plant bark adsorption studies within the domain of the empirical review opted for further modification treatment of the biosorbent this trend can be attributed to the premise that surface area improvement is not as important as it seems when biosorption not just adsorption alone is involved the mechanisms of extra cellular and intracellular accumulation and trapping of pollutants within interstitials on the macro molecular matrix do not depend only on surface area but on particle affinity and functional complexes on the particle surface only one study reported the use of a physical modification technique in improving the adsorption properties of the plant bark powder 101 a popular technique of modification is by the use of acids acids utilised include nitric acid 45 60 88 102 104 sulphuric acid 95 115 118 and hydrochloric acid 47 66 94 the acid activates increase the micro porosity of the biosorbents thereby increasing the surface area 141 on the other hand formaldehyde polymerises and insolubilizes the tannin and pectins present in the biosorbent the process is usually accompanied by heating and stirring for an extended period of time in some studies alkali usually naoh was utilised to hydrolyse the sample instead of acids 2 5 68 while others used a combination of both 76 77 119 modification has also been done by elaborate multi staged processes 89 105 for carbonisation chemical activation has been reportedly done by the wet impregnation of zncl2 4 42 h2so4 108 or k2co3 83 the carbonisation is usually above 400 c the impregnated activation agent generates gaseous chemical species in the furnace which create numerous pores within the material as they escape from the carbon matrix thereby creating a highly porous adsorbent with large surface area the products of carbonisation and chemical modification are usually washed with treated water some studies have incorporated acids 4 42 83 and or base 4 47 66 solution while washing to assist in taking the ph back to neutral and leaching out any foreign chemical species a comprehensive list of the modification techniques is presented in table 3 2 4 effect of modification on surface area in some studies branueur emmet teller bet analysis was conducted to determine the specific surface area of the biosorbent surface area is one of the important property of an adsorbent and plant bark biosorbents have a relativity small surface area this is similar to most other plant biomaterials like leaves 14 as earlier stated the adsorbent and biosorbent do not show full dependence on surface area as extra cellular accumulation and interactions with functional complexes on the adsorbent also play a part therefore despite the relatively low specific surface area of the biosorbents shown in table 4 adsorption capacities for pollutant species are still quite high it can also be observed from table 4 that chemical modification actually improves the specific surface of the adsorbent albeit to a little extent surface area of commercial activated carbons are very high and can be in the range of 700 1400 m2 g activated carbons from plant barks shown in table 4 are also as high especially for melaleuca cajuputi 42 sycamore 4 and hymenaea courbaril 83 3 target impurities for plant bark derived biosorbents about two third of target impurities reported in open literature have been on heavy metals as revealed by fig 5 other pollutants include dyes pharmaceuticals and pesticides albeit with significantly more interest in dyes than the latter two adsorption procedures are usually done in batch systems for empirical studies experiments are performed in glass stoppered erlenmeyer flasks in most cases a known volume of polluted aqueous solution is introduced into the flask a weighed amount of biosorbent is added to the water to form a solution of known concentration or dosage the ph of the solution can be adjusted by small volumes of strong acids and bases and then measured with a ph meter agitation can be achieved by an incubator shaker or centrifuge agitation speed and temperature can be set on the device the experiment is terminated at a known time and adsorbent filtered out with a filter paper the key performance parameters in adsorption are the amount of pollutants adsorbed and the removal efficiency determination of amount adsorbent and removal efficiency is by simple mathematical correlations the amount of pollutant adsorbed can be determined by the expression below in eq 1 1 q v c i c e m where q is the amount of pollutant adsorbed mg g ci is the initial concentration of pollutants mg l and ce is the concentration of pollutants mg l at equilibrium v is the volume of solution l and m is the mass of the adsorbent used m the removal efficiency can be determined by the expression below in eq 2 2 q c i c e c i 100 all parameters have been previously defined 3 1 heavy metals the term heavy metal is entirely applied to a group of metals and metal like elements with density greater than 5 g cm³ atomic number above 20 and is toxic or poisonous at low concentrations 142 examples of elements that considered as a heavy metals includes lead pb chromium cr manganese mn cobalt co nickel ni copper cu zinc zn molybdenum mo mercury hg tin sn cadmium cd antimony sb among others there are three 3 classes of heavy metals that are of concern to environmental scientists and engineers toxic metals such as hg cr pb zn cu ni cd as co sn etc precious metals such as pd pt ag au ru etc and radionuclides such as u th ra etc 142 143 fig 6 informs that cadmium chromium nickel lead and copper are the most studied heavy metals in adsorption studies utilising plant barks lead mercury and cadmium are considered as the most toxic heavy metals and they are sometimes called the big three due to their major adverse impact on the environment 142 heavy metals cannot be destroyed disintegrated digested or degraded by any simple chemical means at low concentration toxicity might be low but these heavy metals become quite toxic at higher concentrations due to their ability to accumulate in living tissues table 5 presents a list of the maximum reported adsorption capacities of different species of plant bark derived adsorbents to different heavy metals as sourced from open literature it can be observed that plant barks have high adsorption capacities for heavy metals though with exceptions a number of factors play important roles in determining the adsorption capacity and these include the nature of the plant material the nature of the chemical modification the nature of the heavy metals species and the solution ph and temperature several studies have compared plant bark biosorbents with other materials due to the differences in experimental methodology and adsorbent modification technique the comparison of the adsorption capacity discussed below will be done only based on findings of the same study and not across different studies park et al 137 observed that biochar from pine bark has a higher adsorption capacity for cd ii 85 8 mg g compared to biochar obtained from other pine residues like the cone 40 8 mg g and the needle 53 8 mg g the shift in the cc functional groups in the biochar surface indicated interaction with cd ii forming cd ii π bonds the ch and co functional groups were also observed to take part in the adsorption in terms of the solution chemistry the adsorption was not favoured at very ow ph due to competition with hydrogen ions at high ph the cd formed hydroxides optimum ph was between 5 and 8 this kind of solution chemistry effect where optimum adsorption is achieved at near neutrality is similar for other heavy metals mohan et al 134 observed that the adsorption capacity of adsorbent prepared from mango bark for as3 1 25 mg g was slightly higher than sugarcane bagasse 1 08 mg g and slightly lesser than guava leaf 1 35 mg g however on the bigger perspective the adsorption capacities observed by mohan et al 134 is lesser than for most other plant bark adsorption studies koetlisi and muchaonyerwa 130 observed that the sorption capacity of pine bark biochar for cr was higher than for biochar from sewage sludge and latrine faecal waste however the sorption capacity was the least of the three adsorbents for both zn ii and cu ii koetlisi and muchaonyerwa 130 attributed these differences to the affinity of the biochar to the respective heavy metals the major mechanism of adsorption for the heavy metals was via complexation with the functional groups on the surface of the adsorbents villaescusa et al 117 observed that adsorbent prepared form yohimbe bark have higher sorption capacity for both cu ii and ni ii compared to adsorbent from cork waste vasudevan et al 116 observed that the sorption capacity of adsorbent from rubber tree bark for cr vi 43 86 mg g was less than for adsorbent from cassava peels 79 37 mg g 3 2 other pollutants other pollutants considered in plant derived adsorbent studies are dyes pharmaceuticals and pesticides dyes studied include methylene blue methyl red methyl orange congo red solar blue remazol amongst others in practice numerous pharmaceutical compounds like ibuprofen ketoprofen amoxicillin naproxen and diclofenac have been proven to be pollutants in aqueous system 145 146 pesticides that have been studied includes atrazine imidacloprid lindane and heptachlor the plant bark derived adsorbents have all shown excellent adsorption capacities for these pollutants and removal efficiencies are especially good as revealed by table 6 however not much can be drawn from the removal efficiency as this depends greatly on the pollutant concentration and adsorbent dosage several studies have compared plant bark biosorbents with other materials the comparison of the adsorption capacity discussed below will be done only based on findings of the same study and not across different studies due to the differences in experimental methodology and adsorbent modification technique the study by pang et al 136 observed that the adsorption capacity of adsorbent prepared from araucaria bark for crystal violet 65 23 mg g at 25 c was the least when compared to adsorbents obtained from pecan nutshell 84 08 mg g para chestnut husk 84 31 mg g and palm cactus 78 17 mg g in a comparative study satish et al 104 evaluated the fluoride sorption capacities of almond tree bark powder against mangrove plant leaf powder pineapple peel powder chiku leaf powder toor plant leaf powder and coconut coir pith the fluoride sorption capacity of almond tree bark powder 1 403 mg g was intermediate when compared to those of mangrove plant leaf powder 2 183 mg g pineapple peel powder 1 266 mg g chiku leaf powder 1 818 mg g toor plant leaf powder 2 151 mg g and coconut coir pith 1 522 mg g 4 plant bark adsorption equilibrium we will proceed to give a brief theoretical background to these isotherms so the results presented in the tables 7 and 8 can be easily understood more extensive information on many more of these isotherms are obtainable in open literature 8 81 the langmuir isotherm model 147 represents one of the first theoretical treatments of nonlinear sorption and suggests that uptake occurs on a homogeneous surface by monolayer sorption without interaction between adsorbed molecules in addition the model assumes uniform energies of adsorption onto the surface and no transmigration of the adsorbate the langmuir monolayer sorption isotherm is based on three assumptions 14 assumption 1 the solid surface presents a finite number of energetically uniform identical sites assumption 2 no interaction exists among adsorbed species i e the amount adsorbed has no influence on the adsorption rate assumption 3 a monolayer is formed when the solid surface reaches saturation each active site were occupied by one particle the general langmuir equation is commonly presented as eq 3 3 q e q m a x b c e 1 b c e and the equation may be linearised as follows in eq 4 4 c e q e 1 q m a x b c e q m a x where qe is the amount of pollutant removed mg g ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l b is the langmuir constant related to affinity and qmax mg g is the maximum pollutant uptake under the given conditions 148 the freundlich isotherm 149 is a nonlinear sorption model which proposes a multilayer sorption with a heterogeneous energetic distribution of active sites accompanied by interactions between adsorbed molecules the freundlich multilayer sorption isotherm is based on three assumptions 14 assumption 1 the uptake of ions occurs on a heterogeneous surface by multilayer adsorption assumption 2 the amount of adsorbate adsorbed increases infinitely with an increase in concentration assumption 3 the stronger binding sites are occupied first and the binding strength decreases with increasing degree of site occupation the general form of this model is given in eq 5 5 q e k f c e 1 n and the equation may be linearised as follows in eq 6 6 l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e where qe is the amount of pollutant removed mg g and ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l kf mg g and n are the freundlich constant and they are related to the sorption capacity and the sorption intensity respectively n value greater than 1 0 shows that the sorption is a favorable physical process 148 temkin isotherm model 150 evaluates that the adsorption heat of all molecules decreases linearly with the increase in coverage of the adsorbent surface the general form of this model is given in eq 7 7 q e r t b i n α c e and the equation may be linearised as follows in eq 8 8 q e β i n α β i n c e where 9 β r t b r is the universal gas constant 8 314 mol k and t is the temperature k also α is the temkin isotherm constant equilibrium binding constant l mol corresponding to the maximum binding energy b is the temkin constant related to the adsorption heat from tables 7 and 8 the reported best fit equilibrium models for plant bark adsorption of heavy metals and other pollutants were langmuir freundlich and temkin models however plant bark adsorption and biosorption was best fit to either langmuir or freundlich in most of the cases we can furthermore utilise the postulates of the langmuir isotherm to gain a proper insight into the nature of the adsorption process for langmuir best fits the pollutants sorption onto the active sites approximates a monolayer whilst multilayer assumptions hold for freundlich best fits in general other factors such as the adsorbent pore size and pollutant size plays a great role in determining if the adsorption process is monolayer or multilayer akar et al 120 studied the sorption of cr vi and ni ii onto both modified and unmodified platanus orientalis bark they fitted only langmuir isotherm to their experimental data albeit with a high coefficient of determination the monolayer adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for ni ii was 126 6 and 285 7 mg g for unmodified and modified and for cr vi was 13 4 and 19 2 mg g for unmodified and modified respectively though adsorbents were better suited for ni ii uptake it was also observed that modification with nitric acid helped improve the performance of the adsorbent for the uptake of cr iii onto pinus pinaster bark arim et al 121 observed langmuir isotherm as best fit with an rmse of 0 914 at an initial metal concentration of 250 mg l devi and mishra 123 fitted the data of the equilibrium adsorption of dysprosium iii onto naoh modified mangifera indica bark they also observed that the langmuir isotherm model was the best fit hence the sorption approximates monolayer georgin et al 125 observed the langmuir isotherm as best fit for the sorption of red 97 dye onto cedrella fissilis bark 5 plant bark adsorption kinetics we will proceed to give a brief theoretical background to these kinetic models so the results presented in the tables can be easily understood more extensive information on other kinetics are obtainable in open literature 8 81 pseudo first order kinetic model assumes that sorption process is first order in nature as it is only dependent on the number of metal ions present at the specific time in the solution 151 pseudo first order or lagergren can be presented as shown in eq 10 10 d q d t k 1 q e q q this then gives us eq 11 11 l o g q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t where k1 min 1 is the rate constant of the pseudo first order adsorption model and qe and qt mg g are the amounts of compound adsorbed onto adsorbent at equilibrium and at any time t min respectively qe and k1 can be calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot of log q e qt versus t pseudo second order kinetic model assumes that the adsorption process is dependent on the number of pollutant ions present in the solution as well as the free adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface 152 pseudo second order model can be presented as shown in eq 12 12 d q d t k 2 q e q q 2 this then gives us eq 13 13 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the rate constant of the pseudo second order adsorption model mg 1 min 1 qe and k2 can be calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot of t q versus t intra particle diffusion model propounds that instantaneous adsorption occurs in the first step the second stage is the gradual adsorption stage where intra particle diffusion is controlled and the final step is the equilibrium step where the solute moves slowly from larger pore to micro pores 153 intra particle diffusion model can be presented as shown in eq 14 14 q t k d i f t 0 5 c where c is a constant which gives information about the thickness of boundary layer and k mg gmin0 5 is the intra particle diffusion rate constant 154 from tables 9 and 10 the kinetics of plant bark adsorption and biosorption is majorly pseudo second order though some studies reported first order and intra particle diffusion as best fit furthermore we can then use the postulates of the pseudo second order kinetics to gain a proper understanding of the adsorption process it can be surmised that for plant bark sorption pollutant uptake is dependent on both the number of ions present in the solution as well as the free sites on the adsorbent surface the kinetics of cr iii uptake onto pinus pinaster bark was studied by arim et al 121 they observed the pseudo second order kinetic model as best fit with an rmse of 0 236 at an initial metal concentration of 250 mg l georgin et al 125 observed that both the pseudo second order kinetic model and the general order kinetic model as best fit for the sorption of red 97 dye onto cedrella fissilis bark ghosh and mondal 126 observed that the sorption of fluoride onto aluminium modified eucalyptus bark was best fit to the pseudo first order model in such a system it can be assumed that only the concentration of metal ions in the system controls the kinetics and not the amount of active sites present on the adsorbent 6 thermodynamic studies the thermodynamic study of adsorption process of pollutants on plant bark derived adsorbents is usually carried out to estimate the feasibility of the adsorption process the gibbs free energy change δ g values can discern whether a process is spontaneous negative values of δ g imply a spontaneous process the enthalpy change δ h provides information about the exothermic or endothermic nature of the process and differentiate between physical and chemical adsorption process the entropy change δ s predicts the magnitude of changes in the reversibility which is affected in its negative values obtained the change in gibbs free energy δ g is given by eq 15 15 δ g r t i n k where r is the universal gas constant t is the temperature in kelvin and k is equilibrium constant van t hoff equation allows obtaining values of enthalpy δ h and entropy δ s the equation is obtained from the free energy equation as follows in eq 16 16 δ g δ h t δ s equating the two expressions for δ g above we have eq 17 17 r t i n k δ h t δ s making i n k the subject of the formulae we obtain the van t hoff equation 18 i n k δ s r δ h r t tables 11 and 12 presents a summary of the empirical thermodynamic findings presented in open literature for plant bark adsorption studies it can observed that most studies reported a negative value of gibbs free energy change δ g this is proof that the adsorption and biosorption of pollutants by plant barks from most pollutant species is highly spontaneous the enthalpy change δ h informs that the sorption process is mainly exothermic for heavy metals and mainly endothermic for other pollutants though with exceptions for an endothermic process high temperature will favour adsorption while for exothermic process low temperatures will favour adsorption the magnitude of the enthalpy change δ h gives us an idea of the type of sorption physical adsorption is usually less than 20 kj mol while chemical adsorption is usually above 80 kj mol from tables 11 and 12 we see that most tree bark adsorption is physical in nature with a few studies being intermediate between both mechanisms the entropy can be used to obtain preliminary insight into the degree of disorderliness of the system a number of the entropy change are positive thereby suggesting an inherent affinity of the adsorbent to those chemical species furthermore these positive entropy change values suggest an increase in the degree of freedom of the adsorbate the negative entropy change observed by argun and dursun 50 chockalingam and subramanian 52 kamari and ngah 66 khosla et al 70 satish et al 104 and munagapati et al 90 suggests an increased disorder during the adsorption process and that the process is enthalpy driven 7 desorption and regeneration studies in desorption the adsorbate are desorbed from the adsorbent by agitation and the aid of a chemical eluent desorption precedes regeneration reusability studies in reusability assessment a series of adsorption desorption cycles are conducted and the continuous decline in adsorbent performance observed gundogdu et al 63 opined that desorption is only of importance when the adsorbent is very expensive to prepare however desorption studies have been a feature of plant bark adsorption papers in recent times the percentage desorbed can be determined using eq 19 19 d e s o r b e d c a d s o r b e d c d e s o r b e d 100 the c in eq 19 is for concentration in the study by afroze et al 5 it was observed that zn ii desorption from adsorbent prepared from eucalyptus sheathiana bark was less than 15 using hcl as eluent this indicates that there is strong binding affinity and the complexes and ligands formed are quite stable ahmad 43 studied the desorption of crystal violet onto adsorbent prepared from pinus roxberghii bark it was observed that using sodium chloride as eluent 67 5 of the adsorbed dye could be desorbed however this increases to about 90 for a column set up the reverse was observed for acetic acid eluent as the percentage desorbed dropped from 88 to 47 5 from batch to column set up justifications were not given in the study for the observed relationship for the desorption of cd ii from adsorbents prepared from pinus nigra bark the desorption efficiency was greatest when hcl was used as eluent then naoh followed by distilled water 49 the acid is a better eluent because the heavy metal ions cannot compete favourably with the hydrogen ions for adsorption sites which then initiates their release from the adsorbent surface into the solution argun and dursun 49 also observed that only slight losses in adsorption and desorption occurred even after 3 usage cycles for all 3 reagents considered cutillas barreiro et al 7 evaluated the desorption of five different heavy metals from adsorbent prepared from pinus pinaster bark using sodium nitrate as eluent it was observed from the study that pb ii was the most recalcitrant from solution while zn ii was the least recalcitrant for the desorption of pb ii from adsorbent prepared from pinus brutia bark gundogdu et al 63 observed a 90 maximum efficiency when 0 5 m hcl was used lesser concentration of the acid gave lesser desorption efficiency in further reusability studies conducted a 20 drop in the adsorption capacity was observed after the first cycle but the study opined that the adsorbent can be used up to 5 times for the desorption of ni ii from moringa oleifera bark reddy et al 101 observed an optimum desorption efficiency of 98 using 0 3 m hcl as eluent further regeneration studies revealed that the adsorbent can be used for up to 6 cycles before losing a good portion of its adsorption capacity arim et al 121 conducted a very detailed desorption and regeneration study for the recovery cr iii from pinus pinaster bark using a variety of eluent types 2 m sulphuric acid was observed to be the best eluent for the process devi and mishra 123 studied the regeneration of dysprosium iii from naoh modified mangifera indica bark they concluded that the adsorbent can be used up to 3 cycles before significant loss in adsorption capacity in a reusability study conducted by li et al 131 for the sorption of ce iii onto uv induced graft polymerised pine bark it was observed that the adsorbent could be used as much as 8 times it retained an adsorption capacity of about 200 mg g on the eight cycle from the initial 256 5 mg g adsorption capacity for ce iii for the reutilisation of black wattle bark activated carbon for the sorption of phenol lütke et al 132 observed a 60 drop in adsorption capacity by the fifth cycle the adsorbent still had a high capacity even at the third cycle but dropped drastically afterwards for the reutilisation of sulphuric acid modified mangifera indica bark adsorbent for the sorption of holmium iii removal efficiency dropped from 91 7 89 5 after four cycles in general it can be observed that plant barks have high reusability potential thereby underlying their usefulness for industrial application table 13 gives a summary of the empirical findings on the desorption of pollutants from plant barks 8 knowledge gaps and research trend from the review a few gaps have been identified that researchers can investigate to improve our understanding of the process and make the adsorbent more competitive in a world of growing alternatives in adsorption technologies there is a dearth of studies on the optimisation of preparation techniques for plant bark adsorption as observed in the study each paper seemed to develop their own method as deemed fit adeniyi and ighalo 14 also made a similar observation on adsorption and biosorption studies involving plant leaves it has also been noticed that less interest is generally paid to the carbonisation of plant barks and this however gives products with the highest specific surface area a good avenue to explore as regards the research area would be to develop and optimise adsorption systems that make use of plant barks and can have industrial applications adsorption in packed columns is an excellent alternative there is also a dearth of studies on the removal of pharmaceutical compounds pesticides personal care products and other emerging contaminants from aqueous media using the class of adsorbent the use of plant bark biosorbent in remediating polluted wastewaters especially in the domain of chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod and turbidity has not been reported at least within the domain of the authors exhaustive search disposal of used adsorbent into the environment is not advised as it makes the initial purpose of environmental pollution control to be defeated most studies do not discuss the methods or avenues for the disposal of their used adsorbents this will need to be addressed by researchers as it can quickly constitute an issue in cases where the process has been scaled up for industrial applications popular disposal technique is by stabilisation in cementitious material or polymeric resins so as to immobilise the pollutants and prevent leaching in the short term financial analysis is another important area that can be explored by researchers in a recent study arim et al 121 evaluated the cost of developing xanthate modified adsorbent from pinus pinaster they predicted a cost of 0 39 us per kg of the adsorbent which is cheaper than others commercial activated carbons and activated carbon from biomass like sugarcane bagasse 155 similar analysis is encouraged in plant leaves biosorption studies as it is a major area of interest to investors and industrial engineers 9 conclusion several key information was deduced from this empirical review it was observed that eucalyptus pine neem acacia and mango trees are the most explored source species in tree bark adsorption studies interest is interestingly big in countries india and nigeria as these have long standing issues with water pollution over population and management of industrial effluents this review classified plant bark adsorbents into 5 groups with justifications unmodified biosorbent pre modified biosorbent chemically modified biosorbent physically modified biosorbent and bio based activated carbon the review elucidated the excellent adsorption capacities of plant bark based adsorbents and biosorbents for the uptake of heavy metals dyes pesticides and other pollutants plant bark sorption is majorly either best fit to langmuir or freundlich isotherm models the kinetics is majorly pseudo second order the review of thermodynamics findings revealed that the adsorption and biosorption of pollutants by plant barks from most plants is highly spontaneous and is by a physical mechanism in most cases it was also observed that plant barks have high reusability potential thereby underlying their usefulness for industrial application knowledge gaps were also observed and discussed some challenges in the research area are the untested adsorption of pharmaceutical compounds pesticides personal care products and other emerging contaminants the need for the investigation of disposal techniques and cost analysis was also highlighted this review serves as an important aggregator of the progress made in the research domain over the past few years and can furthermore serve as a valuable reference point and guide for other researchers compliance

14058,this research investigated the use of fluidized bed crystallization for removing scale forming species and natural organic matter nom from treated municipal wastewater prior to water reclamation the effect of ph on ca2 mg2 silica and nom removal in a fluidized bed crystallization reactor fbcr was determined nom removal in the fbcr was compared to that for the conventional treatments ultrafiltration and ferric chloride coagulation flocculation under optimized conditions fluidized bed crystallization was able to remove more than 99 9 of mg2 97 of ca2 and 42 of silica the fbcr was also able to remove 25 of nom which was intermediate between nom removal by ferric chloride 56 and ultrafiltration 13 size exclusion chromatography organic carbon detection sec ocd indicated that the majority of nom removal occurred via co precipitation with mg oh 2 excitation emission matrix parallel factor eem parafac analysis was used to investigate the types of nom removed the fbcr was able to remove all five nom components three humic acids one fulvic acid and one protein like substance including 100 of the autochthonous fulvic acids ferric chloride was also able to remove all five nom components but only one third of the autochthonous fulvic acids while ultrafiltration was able to remove only 11 of the protein like nom keywords fluidized bed crystallization ultrafiltration ferric chloride coagulation and flocculation excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis 1 introduction potable water scarcity has become an important issue over the last few decades due to changes in rainfall patterns and increasing population recent estimates indicate that over one billion people do not have access to clean potable water and approximately 2 3 billion people live in regions with water shortages 1 thus water reuse and recycling are becoming increasingly necessary to augment potable water supplies 2 high pressure membrane processes such as nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro are commonly used to produce drinking water from various water sources such as seawater brackish water0 and surface water these membrane processes may also be used for converting municipally treated wastewater into potable water 3 however there are additional challenges in treating secondary effluent wastewater to potable quality 4 secondary effluent wastewater contains a more complex mixture of organic matter than most sources of brackish water which contain mostly plant derived humic and fulvic acids treated municipal wastewater contains significant concentrations of microbial proteins and extracelluar polysaccharides that have high membrane fouling potential thus prior to membrane treatment secondary effluent wastewater may require more extensive pretreatment than most brackish waters the goal of pretreatment processes is to obtain the highest level of foulant removal that makes downstream membrane processes technically and economically feasible this will increase water recovery and reduce the volume of concentrate requiring further treatment or disposal contributions to membrane fouling include 1 active and inactive microorganisms 2 adsorbed colloidal material 3 precipitated mineral scale most commonly divalent cations combined with carbonate or sulfate and 4 adsorbed natural organic matter nom such as humic and fulvic acids treatment methods for removing membrane foulants include 1 precipitation processes such as lime softening or fluidized bed crystallization 2 coagulation flocculation processes using iron or aluminum coagulants and 3 membrane processes such as ultrafiltration precipitation processes primarily remove inorganic minerals such as caco3 mg oh 2 and mgo sio2 x h2o x that are precipitated at elevated ph values 5 6 in conventional precipitation softening the maximum ph value is normally kept below 10 5 in order avoid precipitation of mg oh 2 which has unfavorable settling behavior 7 the use of fluidized bed crystallization for mg2 removal avoids the settling problems associated with mg oh 2 precipitation and also requires lower dosages of ph adjusting chemicals than traditional precipitation processes 5 fluidized bed crystallization reactors fbcrs are seeded with sand or other mineral grains that serve as nucleation sites for precipitation of hardness minerals upward flow through the reactor fluidizes the seed bed while injection of an alkaline chemical increases the ph of the solution thereby promoting heterogeneous precipitation on the seed particles heterogeneous precipitation is faster than homogeneous nucleation and requires lower levels of supersaturation to precipitate hardness minerals 5 this means that for similar calcium and magnesium removal less chemical addition is needed for a fbcr compared to conventional softening the typical hydraulic residence time in a fbcr is less than 30 s while the mixing time in conventional softening can take up to 120 min 8 conventional softening produces relatively small crystals due to homogeneous formation of many crystal nuclei this makes the solid liquid separation process difficult since the produced sludge is difficult to dewater 9 in contrast fbcrs produce large particulates with fast settling velocities this leads to particle size classification along the length of the fluidized bed with the largest particles settling to the bottom of the reactor these large particles are periodically flushed from the reactor and are easily dewatered due to their large size 5 mm 5 coagulation and flocculation are cost effective conventional treatments that are often used prior to high pressure membrane filtration processes coagulation is able to effectively remove acidic and hydrophobic organic compounds macromolecules colloidal particles and suspended solids 10 as conventional coagulants ferric or aluminum salts destabilize colloidal particles and provide a high specific surface area for adsorption of organic matter and multivalent cations the most important parameters for an optimized coagulation process are the type of coagulant dose and resulting ph value ultrafiltration uf is becoming an increasingly used pretreatment for ro due to its high removal of suspended and colloidal contaminants uf operates as a physical barrier with pore sizes ranging from 0 002 to 0 1 μm and it is able to achieve over 4 log removal of pathogens such as giardia and cryptosporidium 11 in uf systems turbidity and sdi15 can be lowered to less than 0 1 ntu and 3 respectively 12 13 however uf removes only small amounts of dissolved organic matter mostly due to physical adsorption on the membrane in this study fluidized bed crystallization was used to remove mineral solids and nom from treated municipal wastewater while there are numerous studies on using softening as a pre treatment for high pressure membrane filtration processes 4 6 8 14 16 there are no studies on treating secondary effluent using a fbcr precipitation of both mineral solids and nom in a fbcr may differ significantly from that observed in a typical lime soda ash softening process the ph gradient and absence of homogeneous nucleation in a fbcr may affect the levels of hardness and nom removal compared to conventional softening which has practical limits of 0 6 meq l for ca2 and 0 2 meq l for mg2 7 for nom removal via conventional softening caco3 precipitation removes 10 30 while mg oh 2 precipitation can achieve an additional 30 60 17 in conventional softening the small crystal size and its associated high specific surface area helps promote hydrophobic nom removal by physical adsorption it is unknown how the larger particles produced during fluidized bed crystallization will affect nom removal if fluidized bed crystallization can achieve substantial nom removal in addition to hardness ion removal it may prove to be a superior pretreatment for reverse osmosis than conventional uf or ferric chloride in this research hardness minerals and nom removal from treated municipal wastewater was measured in a fbcr operating with effluent ph values ranging from 10 5 12 the types of nom removal in the fbcr were determined via excitation emission matrix eem and eem parallel factor analysis parafac size exclusion chromatography organic carbon detection sec ocd was used to investigate the co precipitation of inorganic and organic contaminants nom removal in the fbcr was compared to conventional treatment using uf or ferric chloride 2 materials and methods 2 1 treated wastewater effluent

membrane for brackish water bw30 400 was used in the simulations simulations were run for water treated by the uf process for the observed 60 recovery potential water recoveries were also calculated for fbcr treated water for scenarios limited by a calcite langlier saturation index lsi of 1 8 and or a sio2 supersaturation of 200 with the use of antiscalants these values are normally achievable without significant membrane fouling 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 fluidized bed crystallization reactor the fbcr was operated at ph values ranging from 10 5 12 table 2 shows the effluent turbidity and the saturation index for a variety of scale forming mineral species at the influent to the fbcr the saturation index si is defined as 1 s i l o g a i v i k s p where ai is the activity of ion i νi is the stoichiometric coefficient for species i and ksp is the solubility product for the mineral dissolution reaction for all ph values there was an increase in turbidity after the fbcr and it ranged from 0 2 to 0 5 ntus this may indicate the presence of heterogeneous nucleation of mineral solids or may result from particle scouring in the fluidized bed however the increase in turbidity was approximately an order of magnitude smaller than that measured in a previous fbcr study which ranged from 3 6 to 5 2 ntus 26 as shown in table 2 only calcite and barite were supersaturated in the secondary effluent however the extents of supersaturation were significantly below those that lead to homogeneous nucleation which for calcite is 1 7 5 injection of the 0 1 m naoh solution into the fbcr lowered the saturation indices for gypsum and barite due to both dilution and decreases in solution phase activity coefficients by increasing the ph values to 11 5 the si values increased for calcite dolomite huntite and magnesite which is due to the increase in c o 3 2 however the si values decreased for gypsum barite and brucite as a result of decreased activity coefficients associated with increasing ionic strength the si values leveled out or decreased for dolomite brucite and magnesite when the ph of the stream was increased to 12 this results from conversion of h c o 3 to c o 3 2 and decreased activity coefficients however the si value for brucite monotonically increased with ph since it is not affected by the c o 3 2 concentration fig 2 shows the ca2 mg2 and sio2 removal at 4 different ph values as shown in table 2 dolomite and calcite had the highest saturation indices of potentially scale forming mineral species the phreeqc modeling indicated that calcium precipitated as calcium carbonate and the measured ca2 removal reached 97 at ph 12 magnesium was precipitated as magnesium carbonate or incorporated into the crystal lattice of calcium carbonate at ph values 10 5 5 6 magnesium also precipitated as mg oh 2 at higher ph values and mg2 removal reached 99 9 at ph 12 as shown in fig 2c dissolved silica was also removed in the fbcr previous studies have reported that dissolved silica is removed as mgo sio2 x h2o x 27 similar effluent silica concentrations were observed over the ph range 10 5 11 5 where 42 45 silica removal was observed however silica removal was lower at ph 12 which can likely be attributed to depletion of mg2 from the system due to increased mg oh 2 precipitation a particularly important goal for pretreatment of secondary effluent is the removal of organic compounds fig 3 shows toc concentrations at different points in the treatment system toc removal in the fbcr ranged from 7 4 25 and increased with increasing ph value toc removal can occur via co precipitation with calcium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide or by adsorption to mineral precipitates 6 15 16 28 calcite has a highly structured rhombohedral shape and most often possess a negatively charged surface during softening as shown in fig 2 at a ph value of 10 5 there was a 7 4 reduction in toc although the negative surface charge of calcite was unfavorable for adsorption of negatively charged nom incorporation of magnesium in the calcium carbonate crystal can result in a positive surface charge or reduced negative charge on the calcite precipitates 6 therefore a small amount of nom removal was seen at ph 10 5 by increasing the ph to higher values mg oh 2 precipitation became favorable mg oh 2 forms positively charged noncrystalline precipitates with higher surface area compared to calcite 6 this may explain the higher nom removals 25 at a ph value of 12 furthermore at high ph values caoh and mgoh formation may also contribute to direct precipitation of calcium or magnesium humate or fulvate 6 toc concentrations determined via size exclusion chromatography are shown in fig 4 for different points in the system after the fbcr there was an overall trend of organic carbon reduction with increasing ph which is in accordance with the toc data considering ph values of 10 5 and 11 there was an approximately even reduction in all 3 peaks at ph 10 5 while there was slightly higher reduction in the lower molecular weight peak for ph 11 at ph values of 11 5 and 12 sec ocd results show that the high molecular weight fraction of toc in the after fbcr samples are substantially higher than those taken after the 5 μm filter this suggests that the nom is associated with particulate matter produced at ph values of 11 5 and 12 these ph values are where mg oh 2 precipitation occurs this suggests that nom removal at ph values of 11 5 and 12 occurs via co precipitation with mg oh 2 3 2 eem spectra eem data can be used to provide insight into the types of nom removed in the fbcr a recently refined technique that combines eem spectra and parallel factor data analysis is a valuable tool for characterizing nom and tracing its origins in aquatic samples 29 eem spectra of the water samples at different points in the treatment system are shown in figure s1 in the supporting information a series of parafac models from 3 to 7 components were analyzed with non negative constraints and subsequently validated using a split half analysis with s3c3t3 splits 3 combinations 3 tests 3 30 31 among the models tested 2 3 and 5 component models passed the split half validation a five component model was finally selected and its results are reported in table 3 and figure s2 in the supporting information the fluorescence spectra of these five components show a resemblance to organic fluorophores by having multiple excitation maxima for a single emission maxima 32 according to table 3 three of five components are humic like substances comparing the eem maxima spectra of c4 with c1 components c1 has a higher excitation wavelength for an approximately similar emission wavelength excitation at higher wavelength for c1 shows that the fluorophores responsible for this contain several functional groups or have higher aromaticity 36 comparing c1 with c3 humic substances component 3 has longer emission wavelength compared to c1 this might be due to the presence of more conjugated fluorescing molecules in c3 compared to c1 component 5 is identified as tryptophan like protein in several studies cited in table 3 fig 5 shows the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax values for different ph conditions in the fbcr as shown in fig 5a the fbcr was able to reduce the fmax value for all five components removing 7 of c1 100 of c2 55 of c3 40 of c4 and 44 of c5 component 1 shows the lowest removal among the five groups compared to c3 c1 has more functional groups that are deprotonated at high ph values which results in high negative charges for these components as shown in fig 5a there was no removal for this component until ph values above 11 5 which might be due to precipitation of mg oh 2 which possesses a highly positive surface charge for comparison purposes nom removal by uf and fecl3 was also investigated nom removal data by uf is shown in table s1 and eem spectra for uf feed permeate and backwash are shown in figure s3 data for nom removal by fecl3 is shown in figure s4 and eem spectra for the fecl3 treated water is shown in figure s5 the fmax data in fig 5b shows slight to no removal for components 1 4 by uf this is due to the fact that these components are too small to be filtered by the membrane however uf was able to remove approximately 11 of component 5 which consists of large amino acid molecules overall uf was able to remove approximately 18 of the toc in the secondary effluent water as shown in fig 5c the fecl3 was able to remove all 5 nom components with up to 40 of c1 38 of c2 65 of c3 34 of c4 and 26 of c5 overall coagulation by fecl3 was able to remove 49 of toc at the optimal dose of 45 mg l as fe figure s5 this is substantially greater toc removal than the 25 removal in the fbcr at a ph value of 12 3 3 fbcr effect on ro recovery the effect of the fbcr on the water recovery obtainable in a subsequent ro process was calculated using rosa simulation software table 4 shows the saturation indices for compounds that may cause membrane scaling as the ro system is currently operated baso4 has the highest saturation index of potentially scale forming minerals thus it is likely that baso4 has limited the ro recovery to only 60 using uf pretreatment also shown in table 4 are the saturation indices for water treated by fbcr at ph values from 10 5 12 the recovery for these simulations was determined by restricting the lsi to 1 8 and the sio2 supersaturation 200 25 for all fbcr ph values the baso4 saturation index was less than that for the uf pretreatment potential recoveries with pretreatment via the fbcr ranged from 93 to 97 for the lowest recovery of 93 this represents a factor of 5 7 reduction in the volume of concentrate solution as compared to pretreatment using uf this analysis does not include ro recovery being limited by membrane fouling by organic matter however pretreatment by the fbcr removed nearly twice as much nom as uf pretreatment in addition membrane fouling by nom is exacerbated by ca2 37 thus removal of 82 97 of the ca2 in the fbcr is expected to lower membrane fouling by nom 4 conclusions this study investigated the effectiveness of using a fbcr as a pretreatment process for reverse osmosis reclamation of secondary effluent wastewater the fbcr was effective at removing scale forming minerals but was only half as effective as fecl3 for removing nom interestingly uf a technology often recommended as ro pretreatment for water reuse applications showed the least nom removal in the fbcr the highest levels of nom removal occurred at the highest ph values where mg oh 2 precipitation occurs the fbcr was also able to attenuate all five nom components and removed 100 of the autochthonous fulvic acids which are produced by algae and bacteria removal of autochthonous fulvic acids may be an important consideration in water reuse applications since they are likely to comprise a significant fraction of the total nom although fluidized bed crystallization has several advantages over conventional lime softening such as shorter hydraulic detention time reduced chemical usage no mg oh 2 settling issues and elimination of sludge production the maximum 25 nom removal in the fbcr was less than that normally observed for conventional lime softening 7 in addition fecl3 is often added during conventional lime softening to improve nom removal fecl3 addition to a fbcr is not likely to be effective since the process effluent is at a high ph where nom adsorption to ferric hydroxide is greatly reduced thus if high levels of nom removal are required prior to reverse osmosis a separate coagulation step would be recommended after neutralization of the effluent from the

14058,this research investigated the use of fluidized bed crystallization for removing scale forming species and natural organic matter nom from treated municipal wastewater prior to water reclamation the effect of ph on ca2 mg2 silica and nom removal in a fluidized bed crystallization reactor fbcr was determined nom removal in the fbcr was compared to that for the conventional treatments ultrafiltration and ferric chloride coagulation flocculation under optimized conditions fluidized bed crystallization was able to remove more than 99 9 of mg2 97 of ca2 and 42 of silica the fbcr was also able to remove 25 of nom which was intermediate between nom removal by ferric chloride 56 and ultrafiltration 13 size exclusion chromatography organic carbon detection sec ocd indicated that the majority of nom removal occurred via co precipitation with mg oh 2 excitation emission matrix parallel factor eem parafac analysis was used to investigate the types of nom removed the fbcr was able to remove all five nom components three humic acids one fulvic acid and one protein like substance including 100 of the autochthonous fulvic acids ferric chloride was also able to remove all five nom components but only one third of the autochthonous fulvic acids while ultrafiltration was able to remove only 11 of the protein like nom keywords fluidized bed crystallization ultrafiltration ferric chloride coagulation and flocculation excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis 1 introduction potable water scarcity has become an important issue over the last few decades due to changes in rainfall patterns and increasing population recent estimates indicate that over one billion people do not have access to clean potable water and approximately 2 3 billion people live in regions with water shortages 1 thus water reuse and recycling are becoming increasingly necessary to augment potable water supplies 2 high pressure membrane processes such as nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro are commonly used to produce drinking water from various water sources such as seawater brackish water0 and surface water these membrane processes may also be used for converting municipally treated wastewater into potable water 3 however there are additional challenges in treating secondary effluent wastewater to potable quality 4 secondary effluent wastewater contains a more complex mixture of organic matter than most sources of brackish water which contain mostly plant derived humic and fulvic acids treated municipal wastewater contains significant concentrations of microbial proteins and extracelluar polysaccharides that have high membrane fouling potential thus prior to membrane treatment secondary effluent wastewater may require more extensive pretreatment than most brackish waters the goal of pretreatment processes is to obtain the highest level of foulant removal that makes downstream membrane processes technically and economically feasible this will increase water recovery and reduce the volume of concentrate requiring further treatment or disposal contributions to membrane fouling include 1 active and inactive microorganisms 2 adsorbed colloidal material 3 precipitated mineral scale most commonly divalent cations combined with carbonate or sulfate and 4 adsorbed natural organic matter nom such as humic and fulvic acids treatment methods for removing membrane foulants include 1 precipitation processes such as lime softening or fluidized bed crystallization 2 coagulation flocculation processes using iron or aluminum coagulants and 3 membrane processes such as ultrafiltration precipitation processes primarily remove inorganic minerals such as caco3 mg oh 2 and mgo sio2 x h2o x that are precipitated at elevated ph values 5 6 in conventional precipitation softening the maximum ph value is normally kept below 10 5 in order avoid precipitation of mg oh 2 which has unfavorable settling behavior 7 the use of fluidized bed crystallization for mg2 removal avoids the settling problems associated with mg oh 2 precipitation and also requires lower dosages of ph adjusting chemicals than traditional precipitation processes 5 fluidized bed crystallization reactors fbcrs are seeded with sand or other mineral grains that serve as nucleation sites for precipitation of hardness minerals upward flow through the reactor fluidizes the seed bed while injection of an alkaline chemical increases the ph of the solution thereby promoting heterogeneous precipitation on the seed particles heterogeneous precipitation is faster than homogeneous nucleation and requires lower levels of supersaturation to precipitate hardness minerals 5 this means that for similar calcium and magnesium removal less chemical addition is needed for a fbcr compared to conventional softening the typical hydraulic residence time in a fbcr is less than 30 s while the mixing time in conventional softening can take up to 120 min 8 conventional softening produces relatively small crystals due to homogeneous formation of many crystal nuclei this makes the solid liquid separation process difficult since the produced sludge is difficult to dewater 9 in contrast fbcrs produce large particulates with fast settling velocities this leads to particle size classification along the length of the fluidized bed with the largest particles settling to the bottom of the reactor these large particles are periodically flushed from the reactor and are easily dewatered due to their large size 5 mm 5 coagulation and flocculation are cost effective conventional treatments that are often used prior to high pressure membrane filtration processes coagulation is able to effectively remove acidic and hydrophobic organic compounds macromolecules colloidal particles and suspended solids 10 as conventional coagulants ferric or aluminum salts destabilize colloidal particles and provide a high specific surface area for adsorption of organic matter and multivalent cations the most important parameters for an optimized coagulation process are the type of coagulant dose and resulting ph value ultrafiltration uf is becoming an increasingly used pretreatment for ro due to its high removal of suspended and colloidal contaminants uf operates as a physical barrier with pore sizes ranging from 0 002 to 0 1 μm and it is able to achieve over 4 log removal of pathogens such as giardia and cryptosporidium 11 in uf systems turbidity and sdi15 can be lowered to less than 0 1 ntu and 3 respectively 12 13 however uf removes only small amounts of dissolved organic matter mostly due to physical adsorption on the membrane in this study fluidized bed crystallization was used to remove mineral solids and nom from treated municipal wastewater while there are numerous studies on using softening as a pre treatment for high pressure membrane filtration processes 4 6 8 14 16 there are no studies on treating secondary effluent using a fbcr precipitation of both mineral solids and nom in a fbcr may differ significantly from that observed in a typical lime soda ash softening process the ph gradient and absence of homogeneous nucleation in a fbcr may affect the levels of hardness and nom removal compared to conventional softening which has practical limits of 0 6 meq l for ca2 and 0 2 meq l for mg2 7 for nom removal via conventional softening caco3 precipitation removes 10 30 while mg oh 2 precipitation can achieve an additional 30 60 17 in conventional softening the small crystal size and its associated high specific surface area helps promote hydrophobic nom removal by physical adsorption it is unknown how the larger particles produced during fluidized bed crystallization will affect nom removal if fluidized bed crystallization can achieve substantial nom removal in addition to hardness ion removal it may prove to be a superior pretreatment for reverse osmosis than conventional uf or ferric chloride in this research hardness minerals and nom removal from treated municipal wastewater was measured in a fbcr operating with effluent ph values ranging from 10 5 12 the types of nom removal in the fbcr were determined via excitation emission matrix eem and eem parallel factor analysis parafac size exclusion chromatography organic carbon detection sec ocd was used to investigate the co precipitation of inorganic and organic contaminants nom removal in the fbcr was compared to conventional treatment using uf or ferric chloride 2 materials and methods 2 1 treated wastewater effluent

membrane for brackish water bw30 400 was used in the simulations simulations were run for water treated by the uf process for the observed 60 recovery potential water recoveries were also calculated for fbcr treated water for scenarios limited by a calcite langlier saturation index lsi of 1 8 and or a sio2 supersaturation of 200 with the use of antiscalants these values are normally achievable without significant membrane fouling 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 fluidized bed crystallization reactor the fbcr was operated at ph values ranging from 10 5 12 table 2 shows the effluent turbidity and the saturation index for a variety of scale forming mineral species at the influent to the fbcr the saturation index si is defined as 1 s i l o g a i v i k s p where ai is the activity of ion i νi is the stoichiometric coefficient for species i and ksp is the solubility product for the mineral dissolution reaction for all ph values there was an increase in turbidity after the fbcr and it ranged from 0 2 to 0 5 ntus this may indicate the presence of heterogeneous nucleation of mineral solids or may result from particle scouring in the fluidized bed however the increase in turbidity was approximately an order of magnitude smaller than that measured in a previous fbcr study which ranged from 3 6 to 5 2 ntus 26 as shown in table 2 only calcite and barite were supersaturated in the secondary effluent however the extents of supersaturation were significantly below those that lead to homogeneous nucleation which for calcite is 1 7 5 injection of the 0 1 m naoh solution into the fbcr lowered the saturation indices for gypsum and barite due to both dilution and decreases in solution phase activity coefficients by increasing the ph values to 11 5 the si values increased for calcite dolomite huntite and magnesite which is due to the increase in c o 3 2 however the si values decreased for gypsum barite and brucite as a result of decreased activity coefficients associated with increasing ionic strength the si values leveled out or decreased for dolomite brucite and magnesite when the ph of the stream was increased to 12 this results from conversion of h c o 3 to c o 3 2 and decreased activity coefficients however the si value for brucite monotonically increased with ph since it is not affected by the c o 3 2 concentration fig 2 shows the ca2 mg2 and sio2 removal at 4 different ph values as shown in table 2 dolomite and calcite had the highest saturation indices of potentially scale forming mineral species the phreeqc modeling indicated that calcium precipitated as calcium carbonate and the measured ca2 removal reached 97 at ph 12 magnesium was precipitated as magnesium carbonate or incorporated into the crystal lattice of calcium carbonate at ph values 10 5 5 6 magnesium also precipitated as mg oh 2 at higher ph values and mg2 removal reached 99 9 at ph 12 as shown in fig 2c dissolved silica was also removed in the fbcr previous studies have reported that dissolved silica is removed as mgo sio2 x h2o x 27 similar effluent silica concentrations were observed over the ph range 10 5 11 5 where 42 45 silica removal was observed however silica removal was lower at ph 12 which can likely be attributed to depletion of mg2 from the system due to increased mg oh 2 precipitation a particularly important goal for pretreatment of secondary effluent is the removal of organic compounds fig 3 shows toc concentrations at different points in the treatment system toc removal in the fbcr ranged from 7 4 25 and increased with increasing ph value toc removal can occur via co precipitation with calcium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide or by adsorption to mineral precipitates 6 15 16 28 calcite has a highly structured rhombohedral shape and most often possess a negatively charged surface during softening as shown in fig 2 at a ph value of 10 5 there was a 7 4 reduction in toc although the negative surface charge of calcite was unfavorable for adsorption of negatively charged nom incorporation of magnesium in the calcium carbonate crystal can result in a positive surface charge or reduced negative charge on the calcite precipitates 6 therefore a small amount of nom removal was seen at ph 10 5 by increasing the ph to higher values mg oh 2 precipitation became favorable mg oh 2 forms positively charged noncrystalline precipitates with higher surface area compared to calcite 6 this may explain the higher nom removals 25 at a ph value of 12 furthermore at high ph values caoh and mgoh formation may also contribute to direct precipitation of calcium or magnesium humate or fulvate 6 toc concentrations determined via size exclusion chromatography are shown in fig 4 for different points in the system after the fbcr there was an overall trend of organic carbon reduction with increasing ph which is in accordance with the toc data considering ph values of 10 5 and 11 there was an approximately even reduction in all 3 peaks at ph 10 5 while there was slightly higher reduction in the lower molecular weight peak for ph 11 at ph values of 11 5 and 12 sec ocd results show that the high molecular weight fraction of toc in the after fbcr samples are substantially higher than those taken after the 5 μm filter this suggests that the nom is associated with particulate matter produced at ph values of 11 5 and 12 these ph values are where mg oh 2 precipitation occurs this suggests that nom removal at ph values of 11 5 and 12 occurs via co precipitation with mg oh 2 3 2 eem spectra eem data can be used to provide insight into the types of nom removed in the fbcr a recently refined technique that combines eem spectra and parallel factor data analysis is a valuable tool for characterizing nom and tracing its origins in

14059,the novelty of this work lies in the use of a real textile wastewater rtw without a pretreatment without additional carbon sources and undiluted with coupling a photocatalysis by using an unprecedented composite for this application the collected rtw containing the azo dye direct black 22 205 15 mg l 1 toc 672 7 mg l 1 was treated with a bacterial consortium and after 96 h the sequential photocatalysis process was employed using zno polypyrrole during 60 min the coupling of both treatment processes resulted in a total decolorization efficiency of 95 7 and 99 8 of toc degradation 8 76 mg l 1 toc 1 33 mg l 1 degradation product analysis was carried out by lc ms ms and a degradation pathway is proposed the textile wastewater treatment proposed in this work is an attractive alternative and it is highly recommended to apply this system before the disposal of textile effluents in water bodies keywords textile wastewater biological treatment photocatalysis coupled treatment 1 introduction water pollution attracts increasing attention every year around the world for example the united nations established in 2015 a series of sustainable development goals with specific objectives to be achieved by 2030 two of them numbers 6 and 14 are directly related to the water care use and management 1 accordingly textile industries require special attention since in one day an average size textile factory manufactures around 8000 kg of fabric utilizing 1 6 million l of water 2 in mar del plata argentina these industries are of great importance and development hence 32 of industrial effluents are a product of textile activity 3 the bad management and treatment of industrial wastewater result in a major problem for the environment furthermore it has shown that a large amount of dye remains in the wastewater after the dyeing process and it is discharged into the environment along with the rest of the chemicals 2 4 the dyeing process besides consuming high volumes of water also generates very complex effluents these are characterized by organic and inorganic chemicals including dyes the main compounds finishing agents and surfactants 2 5 azo dyes are the most widely used class of synthetic dyes in the textile industry 6 characterized by the presence of one or more azo bonds n n in association with one or more aromatic rings these compounds can also be attached to different functional groups such as nitro carboxyl and sulfonic groups 2 7 due to the high stability and high resistance of the dye structure to external agents it is a challenge to find adequate treatment processes in previous studies dye concentration values up to 250 mg l 1 in rtw have been reported 8 but concentrations over 350 mg l 1 are being measured ongoing studies this causes serious consequences in the environment due to the fact that color interferes with the penetration of sunlight into water bodies affecting photosynthesis which inhibits the growth of aquatic biota and modifies the solubility of gases leading to eutrophication 9 several biological and physical chemical methods have been developed over the years biological treatments are economic simple and environmentally friendly alternatives for there are numerous works that demonstrate the ability of different microorganisms to degrade azo dyes but they often need a previous acclimatization or special nutritional requirements 5 10 12 recently a bacterial consortium which was isolated from the inspection chamber of a dyeing factory had showed noteworthy efficacy to grow in the hazard conditions of real textile wastewater rtw decolorized it and reduces the ph to values close to neutrality 8 however during biological treatments not only dye mineralization is rarely reached but many dyes and especially their reduction products lead to the formation of toxic and carcinogenic aromatic amines 13 15 otherwise physical chemical methods as adsorption are excellent for decolorization however they are not destructive only transferring the pollutant from one phase to another generating solid waste 16 besides advanced oxidative processes aops emerge as promising options for the degradation of organic pollutants in wastewaters as azo dyes among aop based treatments photocatalysis presents most advantages mainly due to the facile coupling with existent plant reactors and it has been largely proved the efficiency of degrading azo dyes 5 17 the technique involve the formation of radicals by ultraviolet uv irradiation a reaction that can be catalyzed by semiconductor materials 18 20 however it is known that as these reactions are light dependent dyes present in textile wastewater interfere with light penetration therefore decolorization efficiency may decrease 21 in addition textile effluents usually have alkaline ph and photocatalysis is a ph dependent process this parameter has to be controlled to obtain high rates of dye removal 17 22 in summary to achieve good dye degradation by photocatalysis more energy consumption and time are needed 17 21 for these reason the coupling of biological and photocatalytic methods could be a good alternative zinc oxide zno is one the most used catalysts presenting better degradation efficiency than tio2 in cases as cited in 23 26 nevertheless simple separation processes are not able to fully recover the particulates 27 thereupon the use of immobilized photocatalysts easily separated at the end of the reaction reduces costs and time spent and can be reused in new photocatalytic cycles 19 28 30 polymeric materials are good alternatives for this purpose for they not only support the semiconductor but increase surface area to volume ratio and reduce the band gap energy 29 31 the polymer used in this research ppy does not suffer degradation of the polymeric chain by photocatalytic effect as ppy acts as a conductive polymer similar to an inorganic semiconductor and its stability is shown in the recycling tests silvestri and co workers had synthesized and characterized a photocatalyst with polymeric polypyrrole ppy and zno the composite presented an excellent photocatalytic activity and was easily recovered after treatments without a significant decrease on the photocatalytic activity in subsequent uses 32 similar results and conclusions were also obtained by other research groups 33 36 considering all these aspects discussed the coupling of biological treatment and photocatalysis can be an ideal alternative by combining a first low cost step with a complete degradation of further recalcitrant compounds still present 19 in summary the objective of this study was i evaluate wastewater degradation by biological and photocatalytic methods employing a bacterial consortium and zno ppy composite respectively ii propose a biological and aop sequential treatment for textile wastewater containing elevated concentrations of azo dyes iii verify direct black 22 db22 dye degradation pathway occurring in both treatments 2 experimental 2 1 wastewater samples textile wastewater was collected from gama s a a textile industry located in mar del plata argentina real textile wastewater rtw containing the db22 a dye widely used to produce black colored clothing pieces was stored in a freezer at 20 c until used in the laboratory db22 was employed to simulate textile wastewater stw its complex structure with four azo bonds and sulfonated groups and characteristics are presented in table 1 37 2 2 microbiological samples the bacterial consortium used in this study was collected from the inspection chamber of the sewer of the factory a place under constant influence of wastewater containing dyes 8 the samples were collected with sterile cotton swabs and taken immediately to the laboratory once there a previous enrichment was performed before starting the biological treatment the liquid medium used for this purpose was luria bertani lb incubations were carried out in an erlenmeyer flask during 12 h in the absence of light 25 c and constant agitation at 120 rpm 2 3 biological treatment to evaluate the capability of the bacterial consortium for degrading the dye present in the wastewater decolorization was measured at regular time intervals glass flasks with screw cap to simulate microaerophilic conditions were filled with 110 ml of the textile wastewater and then inoculated with 10 ml of the previously mentioned lb culture non inoculated wastewater was used as control at the time of sampling 1 ml of each flask was collected and clarified centrifuging at 14 000 rpm for 10 min to avoid absorbance interference from cellular debris or other solids suspended remains the concentration of azo dye mg l 1 was monitored in a spectrophotometer wavelength measurement was performed at 480 nm the maximal absorbance in the visible region the concentration was estimated using a calibration curve in agreement with lambert beer s law and the experiments are done in triplicate 2 4 photocatalytic experiments the synthesis and characterization of the composite zno ppy 25 1 ratio was reported by silvestri and collaborators 32 the assays were performed in a glass reactor containing 200 ml 50 mg l 1 of simulated wastewater with db22 dye solution and zno ppy composite different concentrations of composite were tested being 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 g l 1 the reaction initiated as soon as the solution was exposed to ultraviolet uv irradiation provided by a lamp avant mercury vapor 125 w 280 380 nm a schematic representation of the apparatus is presented in fig 1 all photodegradation experiments were carried out at 25 c for 1 h by re circulating cooling water around the reactor while agitation was maintained aliquots of 3 ml were periodically withdrawn centrifuged and the absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu measured in the 1 0 cm optical path length of a glass cuvette at 200 700 nm range experiments were carried out with real textile wastewater rtw containing the same concentration of db22 of simulated wastewater stw starting at the endpoint evaluation of the biological treatment to test the reusability cyclic experiments were conducted after each cycle the composite was recovered by filtration washed several times with deionized water and oven dried for 1 h at 60 c for the subsequent cycle recycled zno ppy was further characterized before and after of tests by ft ir and xrd for verifying the occurrence of structural modifications 2 5 analytical procedures all spectral variations occurring during the reaction were analyzed by a shimadzu uv 2600 spectrophotometer japan with scan method total organic carbon toc was measured by a shimadzu toc lcph cpn in order to elucidate the degradation pathway the identification of major intermediates was conducted by lc ms ms agilent technologies triple quadrupole 6460 lc ms ms equipped with an electrospray ionization esi source the gas temperature was 300 c and the dry gas flow was 5 l min 1 the nebulizer remained at 45 psi the capillary voltage was 3500 v and the 5 v fragmentator analyte solution was introduced at a flow rate of 5 μl min 1 nitrogen was used as nebulizing gas and as collision gas molecular ions were detected using the negative mode in the scan method the mobile phase used in lc was water acetonitrile 95 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 biological treatment previously we reported the potential of a bacterial consortium for decolorize rtw resistant to severe conditions present such as high ph and salinity 8 the study of the degradation process optimization demonstrated good performance under microaerophilic conditions at room temperature with different carbon sources not employed in this study the characterization of the effluent showed an initial concentration of db22 of 205 15 2 21 mg l 1 toc of 672 7 1 63 mg l 1 and an initial ph of 9 54 0 08 the result of the biological treatment fig 2 represents the decrease in the concentration of db22 as a function of time after the first 24 h a decolorization of 63 92 4 82 with an initial rate of 6 29 1 01 mg l 1 h 1 was observed the decolorization rate was expressed as mg of azo dye per volume and time mg l 1 h 1 following a first order reaction 8 the removal rate obtained is similar to those reported by other authors but in simulated effluents 10 at the end of the essay the concentration of db22 was 58 72 3 33 mg l 1 representing a decolorization of 71 38 1 41 with a decrease of ph to 6 69 0 06 as was mentioned before several studies demonstrated the ability of different microorganisms in pure or mixed cultures in aerobic microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions of degrading dyes for textile wastewater treatment however most studies were carried out with simulated effluents or directly a target dye was added to a traditional culture media 12 19 38 studies where real wastewater is used usually diluted the effluent 39 or added an external source of carbon and or nitrogen 16 when the process is considered in large scale the improvement of the conditions to enable microorganisms culture i e controlled ph constant temperature and addition of carbon and or nitrogen sources result in a more expensive process altogether and therefore unrealistic decolorization was evaluated until day 10 240 h and the results did not improve 59 18 8 00 mg l 1 azo dye reduction products are presumably responsible for this effect 40 microbial degradation of this class of dyes involves the reductive cleavage of azo bonds the mechanism suggests azo reductase enzymes which under anaerobic conditions lead to the formation of aromatic amines 10 12 these intermediates products are widely reported as carcinogenic mutagenic and teratogenic furthermore it has been demonstrated covalent binding of azo dye metabolites to dna and it is known the relationship of this fact to mutagenic process 41 then the accumulation of degradation products probably results in an increase of the toxicity of the medium inhibiting bacterial consortium growth in addition decolorization efficiency of 71 38 1 41 for db22 in rtw was reached by using a low cost and easy to implement technology when compared to other commonly used treatment methods still there is a limit on biodegradation performance widely reported and supported by previous results discussed 2 9 10 12 16 42 therefore for an adequate treatment of textile wastewater it is necessary to complement the biological treatment with other polishing alternatives as photocatalysis 3 2 photocatalysis with the aim to know if the composite was able to degrade db22 before starting the rtw assays a simulated solution with db22 50 mg l 1 was prepared stw this dye concentration was the one reached after 4 days of biological treatment three different concentrations of zno ppy composite were tested being 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 g l 1 fig 3 based on previous studies the best performance for the composite was obtained with the 25 1 ppy zno ratio in addition the composite characterization was previously published 32 the photocatalytic activity to stw by 1 0 g l 1 presented a better decolorization performance than 0 5 g l 1 and 2 0 g l 1 of zno ppy an optimal amount of photocatalyst is believed to be necessary to generate enough reactive species for an effective degradation 32 then same tests were performed with the collected rtw which was previously diluted until to obtain a db22 concentration of 50 mg l 1 since this dye concentration was the one reached after 4 days of biological treatment a composite concentration of 1 0 g l 1 was used based on the results obtained with the stw however results with 1 0 g l 1 did not show an improved performance fig 3 for this reason other composite concentrations were tested and better results were obtained with 2 0 g l 1 of zno ppy when the composite pollutant ratio is higher the decolorization decreases these results can be explained by considering that unused catalytic sites are interacting with uv irradiance among themselves causing a delocalization in electronic transferring on the catalyst like was observed with the stw 32 considering that the rtw has a more elevated organic load and other molecules than the target pollutant the hypothesis of electronic delocalization by interaction between unused sites is reinforced fig 3 zinc oxide is widely used in photocatalytic applications 23 24 for verifying if the decolorization was promoted by the composite or by ppy or zno only individual photocatalytic activity tests were carried out since the synthesized composite ratio of ppy to zno is 25 1 equivalent amounts were used being 1 92 and 0 08 g l 1 respectively zinc oxide presented a final decolorization of 11 43 while ppy reached 63 44 and the composite was able to remove 83 55 of color in 60 min fig 4 polypyrrole is commonly used as a dye adsorbent by intraparticle diffusion 43 due to the size and spherical shape of the polymer see images in 32 and as a conductive polymer it is capable of electron transfer in such a way as to contribute to the process of adsorption degradation of pollutants such as diclofenac 32 4 chlorophenol 29 and methylene blue dye 43 the electronic properties of polymeric materials are restricted to those that have a conjugated structure that is that have alternation of single and double bonds such as ppy its electronic structure can be described by the overlapping of the pz orbitals resulting from the sp2 pz hybridization of its carbon atoms the σ bonds formed by the overlapping of the sp2 hybrid orbitals join the carbon atoms in the main polymeric chain while and π bonds formed by the overlapping of the pz orbitals give rise to empty π and occupied orbitals π giving rise to molecular orbitals analogous to the known valence and conduction bands in contractors in inorganic semiconductors 44 47 the results observed prove that not only ppy and zno are in synergy in the composite but in the meantime that ppy itself has intrinsic electronic conductivity and is a promising supporting polymer that can be considered for further catalytic applications moreover besides avoiding electron hole recombination by supporting zno on ppy the separation process is facilitated as specific surface area is increased zno 4 9 m2 g 1 ppy 24 4 m2 g 1 zno ppy 48 0 m2 g 1 according to previous characterizations 32 for evaluating the recyclability of zno ppy composite a total of 3 cyclic experiments were performed and the results show that degradation efficiency remained similar between the 2nd and 3rd consecutive run fig 5 recycled zno ppy was further characterized before and after of tests by ft ir and xrd figure s1 a and b and none of the occurrence of structural modifications was observed both ftir spectra before and after of the composite are similar with characteristic bands at the same positions as the results shown in the diffractograms the degradation rate constant of db22 was pre determined from stw optimized experiments from a pseudo first order kinetic equation ln c c0 kt where k is the degradation rate constant c is the concentration of db22 at time t and c0 is the initial concentration of db22 the photocatalytic activity of the samples can be evaluated by means of k fig 6 a the degradation rate constant k min 1 to zno ppy is higher than that of zno or ppy alone when the value of k is higher higher is the photocatalytic activity by the ln c c0 plots it is possible to notice a positive increase between 0 and 20 min and a negative decrease between 20 and 60 min these variations suggest that at least two by products are being formed being the first probably a large molecule rupturing and in a second moment the formation of smaller fragments further tests performed with rtw with similar db22 concentration stw demonstrated a small diminishment in k value from 0 030 to 0 023 min 1 acceptable when it is considered the presence of other organic compounds fig 6b 3 3 sequential of biological treatment and photocatalysis as mentioned before in the collected rtw the db22 concentration started as 205 15 mg l 1 after 96 h of biological treatment it was reduced to 58 72 mg l 1 showing a removal efficiency of 71 3 the decolorization efficiency during 60 min of photocatalysis process was 89 00 for stw and 83 55 for rtw both with initial dye concentration 50 mg l 1 finally sequential treatments experiments were done biological treatment was applied following by photocatalysis and the final concentration after 60 min of reaction was 8 76 mg l 1 the coupling of both treatment processess resulted in a total decolorization efficiency of 95 73 fig 7 while the final toc removal reached remarkable 99 87 0 02 1 33 0 05 mg l 1 table 2 clearly illustrates the decolorization and removal efficiency of toc for each step of the separately applied and coupled treatments the photocatalysis process is dependent on light and the collected rtw is high colored not allowing light penetration therefore this would extend treatment time due to the elevated oxidizing potential of advanced processes as photocatalysis organic molecules can be ruptured to fragments that have no metabolic value hence no further degradation occurs 19 when the stages are inverted and aops are applied as a polishing stage already smaller molecules are easily degraded and mineralization can occur this results in a process with elevated viability since the bacterial consortium is intrinsic of the rtw treatment environment and as after 96 h of biological treatment db22 concentration has decreased to approximately 50 mg l 1 that can be fully degraded after 1 h of photocatalysis as a post treatment stage spectral monitoring of stw over the course of the reaction show that by adding the composite there is a slight increase of adsorption that decreases continuously until 60 min of photocatalysis fig 8 a moreover the profile of the bands is maintained for both stw and rtw it is possible to notice an initial blue shift where λmax 484 nm ranged to 474 nm for rtw that can be explained when is considered that other organic molecules are present and π π stacking interactions could be occurring 48 49 fig 8b 3 3 1 evaluation of solar photocatalysis viability sunlight photocatalytic viability is decisive for water treatment approaches degradation experiments of rtw and stw were carried with db22 at 50 mg l 1 concentration tests without the addition of zno ppy were also performed control considering that the rtw has a more elevated organic load and other molecules than the target pollutant the hypothesis of electronic delocalization by interaction between unused sites is reinforced therefore for comparative purposes subsequent solar radiation tests were evaluated using 1 g l 1 of zno ppy composite fig 9 illustrates the decolorization efficiency confirming that the composite leads to a remarkable enhancement in the photocatalytic degradation under sunlight irradiation 120 min results were similar with previous tests performed with uv irradiance provided by a lamp therefore the use of solar radiation is environmentally friendly being indicated as soon efficient as the radiation provided by the lamp but with the advantage of being a renewable affordable available and free source of energy more studies should be done to optimize this treatment step 3 3 2 treatment proposal after discussing all data obtained in this study table 2 it is possible to affirm that the coupling of biological treatment with zno ppy photocatalysis constitutes a suitable environmentally friendly technology hence in fig s3 we propose a treatment sequence i the wastewater generated must be filtered in order to remove suspended solids as fabric fibers since the dyeing process is performed around at 40 100 c a temperature equalizer tank is needed ii when the wastewater has cooled down to 25 c a pump flow it to the biological reactor with minimum retention time of 96 h iii the effluent is again filtered to remove bacterial agglomerates and other suspended solids then solar photocatalysis is applied using the zno ppy composite after 2 h the effluent must pass a separator filter the treated wastewater can be discharged while the catalyst is recovered and recycled to the process 3 4 db22 degradation pathway experimental procedures were conducted at the optimum conditions defined previously according to the db22 ft ir analysis fig 10 it is possible to identify the vibration of some groups present in the fragments over the proposed sequential treatment at 3479 and 3412 cm 1 there are characteristic peaks of medium weak secondary amine n h stretches with lower intensity after 60 min of photocatalysis indicating their fragmentation the peak at 3125 cm 1 corresponds to the primary amines nh present in the db22 dye structure at 1642 and 1611 cm 1 peaks are noted for a strong stretch of tertiary amine or co which is fragmented over time the peak at 1398 cm 1 appears quite intense after photocatalysis and refers to an average asymmetric deformation of ch3 suggesting the rupture of the benzene rings peaks 1117 cm 1 and 617 cm 1 are indicative of weak stretching of alkyl amine c n and c h outside the benzene ring plane respectively fragments are very likely to react to each other and generate new species see fig 11 lc ms ms was employed for the determination of fragments fig s2 in fig s2 fragments between m z 900 and 1050 were observed to increase in intensity during the biological treatment fig s2a these fragments have reduced intensity in the photocatalytic process fig s2b and were maintained when biological treatment precedes photocatalysis fig s2c in addition during the biological treatment fig s2a fragments between m z 300 150 not identified were generated in larger quantity evidenced by the increase of their intensity whereas fragments between m z 300 900 present in the biological treatment were cleaved by free radicals o2 and oh in photocatalysis according to figure s2 it was possible to identify some fragments referring to the cleavage of dye molecule db22 by free radicals o2 and oh generated by the composite suggesting a simple fragmentation route 32 during the biological treatment it is suggested the formation of fragments similar to those described in fig 11 route a by the cleavage of terminal nitrogen groups 15 50 it is widely reported that many bacterial strains can produce specific enzymes which are capable of cleaving amino bonds afterward the microorganisms can conduct further reactions fragmenting a complex initial compound to simple molecules or even mineralization can occurs in some cases 10 13 in this case only accessible terminal nh2 nitrogen bonds are reduced in agreement with previous reports which showed that chemical structures of the dyes largely influence in their degradation and the steric hindrance by r groups would not allow the access of the enzymes to the azo bonds 51 53 during the photocatalysis process using zno ppy it is suggested that desulfonation take place first in the db22 molecules fig 11 route b 54 and then complete degradation occurs finally the results suggest that during the biological photocatalytic treatments first the microorganisms cleavage accessible nitrogen groups of db22 producing fragments about m z 524 then photocatalytic process produces the desulfonation of these fragments leading to the complete mineralization of the dye accordingly supported by the identification of m z peaks corresponding to db22 we propose that biological treatment is responsible for the route a shown in fig 11 also this hypothesis is reinforced by ph which decreases 9 54 initial to 6 69 after 96 h possibly due to the formation of sulfonic acid 55 the results are in accordance with toc analysis which implies that the pollutants were mineralized no reports of toxicity of fragments generated by the coupled biological treatment process followed by photocatalysis as suggested in this paper were found 4 conclusion a real textile wastewater treatment method coupling biological and photocatalytic treatments was proposed in this work after biological treatment a decolorization of 71 3 was obtained with a decrease of ph the biological treatment is a key step to then photocatalytic process can act efficiently without high time consuming and with a reduction of the use of uv lamp sequentially applying the photocatalysis process was able to improve the decolorization resulting in a total decolorization efficiency of 95 7 whereas the final toc removal reached remarkable 99 8 in addition the use of solar photocatalysis gives promising results showing that uv lamp could be replaced by solar radiation a simple dye fragmentation route was proposed where the bacterial consortium cleavage the terminal nitrogen groups of db22 probably by azo reductase activity and then photocatalytic process produces the desulfonation of the dye by the oh and o2 radicals generated by the composite the composite was evaluated in 3 reuse cycles with similar efficiency without structural modifications in composite the coupling of biological and photocatalytic treatments have shown to be a promising

14059,the novelty of this work lies in the use of a real textile wastewater rtw without a pretreatment without additional carbon sources and undiluted with coupling a photocatalysis by using an unprecedented composite for this application the collected rtw containing the azo dye direct black 22 205 15 mg l 1 toc 672 7 mg l 1 was treated with a bacterial consortium and after 96 h the sequential photocatalysis process was employed using zno polypyrrole during 60 min the coupling of both treatment processes resulted in a total decolorization efficiency of 95 7 and 99 8 of toc degradation 8 76 mg l 1 toc 1 33 mg l 1 degradation product analysis was carried out by lc ms ms and a degradation pathway is proposed the textile wastewater treatment proposed in this work is an attractive alternative and it is highly recommended to apply this system before the disposal of textile effluents in water bodies keywords textile wastewater biological treatment photocatalysis coupled treatment 1 introduction water pollution attracts increasing attention every year around the world for example the united nations established in 2015 a series of sustainable development goals with specific objectives to be achieved by 2030 two of them numbers 6 and 14 are directly related to the water care use and management 1 accordingly textile industries require special attention since in one day an average size textile factory manufactures around 8000 kg of fabric utilizing 1 6 million l of water 2 in mar del plata argentina these industries are of great importance and development hence 32 of industrial effluents are a product of textile activity 3 the bad management and treatment of industrial wastewater result in a major problem for the environment furthermore it has shown that a large amount of dye remains in the wastewater after the dyeing process and it is discharged into the environment along with the rest of the chemicals 2 4 the dyeing process besides consuming high volumes of water also generates very complex effluents these are characterized by organic and inorganic chemicals including dyes the main compounds finishing agents and surfactants 2 5 azo dyes are the most widely used class of synthetic dyes in the textile industry 6 characterized by the presence of one or more azo bonds n n in association with one or more aromatic rings these compounds can also be attached to different functional groups such as nitro carboxyl and sulfonic groups 2 7 due to the high stability and high resistance of the dye structure to external agents it is a challenge to find adequate treatment processes in previous studies dye concentration values up to 250 mg l 1 in rtw have been reported 8 but concentrations over 350 mg l 1 are being measured ongoing studies this causes serious consequences in the environment due to the fact that color interferes with the penetration of sunlight into water bodies affecting photosynthesis which inhibits the growth of aquatic biota and modifies the solubility of gases leading to eutrophication 9 several biological and physical chemical methods have been developed over the years biological treatments are economic simple and environmentally friendly alternatives for there are numerous works that demonstrate the ability of different microorganisms to degrade azo dyes but they often need a previous acclimatization or special nutritional requirements 5 10 12 recently a bacterial consortium which was isolated from the inspection chamber of a dyeing factory had showed noteworthy efficacy to grow in the hazard conditions of real textile wastewater rtw decolorized it and reduces the ph to values close to neutrality 8 however during biological treatments not only dye mineralization is rarely reached but many dyes and especially their reduction products lead to the formation of toxic and carcinogenic aromatic amines 13 15 otherwise physical chemical methods as adsorption are excellent for decolorization however they are not destructive only transferring the pollutant from one phase to another generating solid waste 16 besides advanced oxidative processes aops emerge as promising options for the degradation of organic pollutants in wastewaters as azo dyes among aop based treatments photocatalysis presents most advantages mainly due to the facile coupling with existent plant reactors and it has been largely proved the efficiency of degrading azo dyes 5 17 the technique involve the formation of radicals by ultraviolet uv irradiation a reaction that can be catalyzed by semiconductor materials 18 20 however it is known that as these reactions are light dependent dyes present in textile wastewater interfere with light penetration therefore decolorization efficiency may decrease 21 in addition textile effluents usually have alkaline ph and photocatalysis is a ph dependent process this parameter has to be controlled to obtain high rates of dye removal 17 22 in summary to achieve good dye degradation by photocatalysis more energy consumption and time are needed 17 21 for these reason the coupling of biological and photocatalytic methods could be a good alternative zinc oxide zno is one the most used catalysts presenting better degradation efficiency than tio2 in cases as cited in 23 26 nevertheless simple separation processes are not able to fully recover the particulates 27 thereupon the use of immobilized photocatalysts easily separated at the end of the reaction reduces costs and time spent and can be reused in new photocatalytic cycles 19 28 30 polymeric materials are good alternatives for this purpose for they not only support the semiconductor but increase surface area to volume ratio and reduce the band gap energy 29 31 the polymer used in this research ppy does not suffer degradation of the polymeric chain by photocatalytic effect as ppy acts as a conductive polymer similar to an inorganic semiconductor and its stability is shown in the recycling tests silvestri and co workers had synthesized and characterized a photocatalyst with polymeric polypyrrole ppy and zno the composite presented an excellent photocatalytic activity and was easily recovered after treatments without a significant decrease on the photocatalytic activity in subsequent uses 32 similar results and conclusions were also obtained by other research groups 33 36 considering all these aspects discussed the coupling of biological treatment and photocatalysis can be an ideal alternative by combining a first low cost step with a complete degradation of further recalcitrant compounds still present 19 in summary the objective of this study was i evaluate wastewater degradation by biological and photocatalytic methods employing a

the decolorization rate was expressed as mg of azo dye per volume and time mg l 1 h 1 following a first order reaction 8 the removal rate obtained is similar to those reported by other authors but in simulated effluents 10 at the end of the essay the concentration of db22 was 58 72 3 33 mg l 1 representing a decolorization of 71 38 1 41 with a decrease of ph to 6 69 0 06 as was mentioned before several studies demonstrated the ability of different microorganisms in pure or mixed cultures in aerobic microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions of degrading dyes for textile wastewater treatment however most studies were carried out with simulated effluents or directly a target dye was added to a traditional culture media 12 19 38 studies where real wastewater is used usually diluted the effluent 39 or added an external source of carbon and or nitrogen 16 when the process is considered in large scale the improvement of the conditions to enable microorganisms culture i e controlled ph constant temperature and addition of carbon and or nitrogen sources result in a more expensive process altogether and therefore unrealistic decolorization was evaluated until day 10 240 h and the results did not improve 59 18 8 00 mg l 1 azo dye reduction products are presumably responsible for this effect 40 microbial degradation of this class of dyes involves the reductive cleavage of azo bonds the mechanism suggests azo reductase enzymes which under anaerobic conditions lead to the formation of aromatic amines 10 12 these intermediates products are widely reported as carcinogenic mutagenic and teratogenic furthermore it has been demonstrated covalent binding of azo dye metabolites to dna and it is known the relationship of this fact to mutagenic process 41 then the accumulation of degradation products probably results in an increase of the toxicity of the medium inhibiting bacterial consortium growth in addition decolorization efficiency of 71 38 1 41 for db22 in rtw was reached by using a low cost and easy to implement technology when compared to other commonly used treatment methods still there is a limit on biodegradation performance widely reported and supported by previous results discussed 2 9 10 12 16 42 therefore for an adequate treatment of textile wastewater it is necessary to complement the biological treatment with other polishing alternatives as photocatalysis 3 2 photocatalysis with the aim to know if the composite was able to degrade db22 before starting the rtw assays a simulated solution with db22 50 mg l 1 was prepared stw this dye concentration was the one reached after 4 days of biological treatment three different concentrations of zno ppy composite were tested being 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 g l 1 fig 3 based on previous studies the best performance for the composite was obtained with the 25 1 ppy zno ratio in addition the composite characterization was previously published 32 the photocatalytic activity to stw by 1 0 g l 1 presented a better decolorization performance than 0 5 g l 1 and 2 0 g l 1 of zno ppy an optimal amount of photocatalyst is believed to be necessary to generate enough reactive species for an effective degradation 32 then same tests were performed with the collected rtw which was previously diluted until to obtain a db22 concentration of 50 mg l 1 since this dye concentration was the one reached after 4 days of biological treatment a composite concentration of 1 0 g l 1 was used based on the results obtained with the stw however results with 1 0 g l 1 did not show an improved performance fig 3 for this reason other composite concentrations were tested and better results were obtained with 2 0 g l 1 of zno ppy when the composite pollutant ratio is higher the decolorization decreases these results can be explained by considering that unused catalytic sites are interacting with uv irradiance among themselves causing a delocalization in electronic transferring on the catalyst like was observed with the stw 32 considering that the rtw has a more elevated organic load and other molecules than the target pollutant the hypothesis of electronic delocalization by interaction between unused sites is reinforced fig 3 zinc oxide is widely used in photocatalytic applications 23 24 for verifying if the decolorization was promoted by the composite or by ppy or zno only individual photocatalytic activity tests were carried out since the synthesized composite ratio of ppy to zno is 25 1 equivalent amounts were used being 1 92 and 0 08 g l 1 respectively zinc oxide presented a final decolorization of 11 43 while ppy reached 63 44 and the composite was able to remove 83 55 of color in 60 min fig 4 polypyrrole is commonly used as a dye adsorbent by intraparticle diffusion 43 due to the size and spherical shape of the polymer see images in 32 and as a conductive polymer it is capable of electron transfer in such a way as to contribute to the process of adsorption degradation of pollutants such as diclofenac 32 4 chlorophenol 29 and methylene blue dye 43 the electronic properties of polymeric materials are restricted to those that have a conjugated structure that is that have alternation of single and double bonds such as ppy its electronic structure can be described by the overlapping of the pz orbitals resulting from the sp2 pz hybridization of its carbon atoms the σ bonds formed by the overlapping of the sp2 hybrid orbitals join the carbon atoms in the main polymeric chain while and π bonds formed by the overlapping of the pz orbitals give rise to empty π and occupied orbitals π giving rise to molecular orbitals analogous to the known valence and conduction bands in contractors in inorganic semiconductors 44 47 the results observed prove that not only ppy and zno are in synergy in the composite but in the meantime that ppy itself has intrinsic electronic conductivity and is a promising supporting polymer that can be considered for further catalytic applications moreover besides avoiding electron hole recombination by supporting zno on ppy the separation process is facilitated as specific surface area is increased zno 4 9 m2 g 1 ppy 24 4 m2 g 1 zno ppy 48 0 m2 g 1 according to previous characterizations 32 for evaluating the recyclability of zno ppy composite a total of 3 cyclic experiments were performed and the results show that degradation efficiency remained similar between the 2nd and 3rd consecutive run fig 5 recycled zno ppy was further characterized before and after of tests by ft ir and xrd figure s1 a and b and none of the occurrence of structural modifications was observed both ftir spectra before and after of the composite are similar with characteristic bands at the same positions as the results shown in the diffractograms the degradation rate constant of db22 was pre determined from stw optimized experiments from a pseudo first order kinetic equation ln c c0 kt where k is the degradation rate constant c is the concentration of db22 at time t and c0 is the initial concentration of db22 the photocatalytic activity of the samples can be evaluated by means of k fig 6 a the degradation rate constant k min 1 to zno ppy is higher than that of zno or ppy alone when the value of k is higher higher is the photocatalytic activity by the ln c c0 plots it is possible to notice a positive increase between 0 and 20 min and a negative decrease between 20 and 60 min these variations suggest that at least two by products are being formed being the first probably a large molecule rupturing and in a second moment the formation of smaller fragments further tests performed with rtw with similar db22 concentration stw demonstrated a small diminishment in k value from 0 030 to 0 023 min 1 acceptable when it is considered the presence of other organic compounds fig 6b 3 3 sequential of biological treatment and photocatalysis as mentioned before in the collected rtw the db22 concentration started as 205 15 mg l 1 after 96 h of biological treatment it was reduced to 58 72 mg l 1 showing a removal efficiency of 71 3 the decolorization efficiency during 60 min of photocatalysis process was 89 00 for stw and 83 55 for rtw both with initial dye concentration 50 mg l 1 finally sequential treatments experiments were done biological treatment was applied following by photocatalysis and the final concentration after 60 min of reaction was 8 76 mg l 1 the coupling of both treatment processess resulted in a total decolorization efficiency of 95 73 fig 7 while the final toc removal reached remarkable 99 87 0 02 1 33 0 05 mg l 1 table 2 clearly illustrates the decolorization and removal efficiency of toc for each step of the separately applied and coupled treatments the photocatalysis process is dependent on light and the collected rtw is high colored not allowing light penetration therefore this would extend treatment time due to the elevated oxidizing potential of advanced processes as photocatalysis organic molecules can be ruptured to fragments that have no metabolic value hence no further degradation occurs 19 when the stages are inverted and aops are applied as a polishing stage already smaller molecules are easily degraded and mineralization can occur this results in a process with elevated viability since the bacterial consortium is intrinsic of the rtw treatment environment and as after 96 h of biological treatment db22 concentration has decreased to approximately 50 mg l 1 that can be fully degraded after 1 h of photocatalysis as a post treatment stage spectral monitoring of stw over the course of the reaction show that by adding the composite there is a slight increase of adsorption that decreases continuously until 60 min of photocatalysis fig 8 a moreover the profile of the bands is maintained for both stw and rtw it is possible to notice an initial blue shift where λmax 484 nm ranged to 474 nm for rtw that can be explained when is considered that other organic molecules are present and π π stacking interactions could be occurring 48 49 fig 8b 3 3 1 evaluation of solar photocatalysis viability sunlight photocatalytic viability is decisive for water treatment approaches degradation experiments of rtw and stw were carried with db22 at 50 mg l 1 concentration tests without the addition of zno ppy were also performed control considering that the rtw has a more elevated organic load and other molecules than the target pollutant the hypothesis of electronic delocalization by interaction between unused sites is reinforced therefore for comparative purposes subsequent solar radiation tests were evaluated using 1 g l 1 of zno ppy composite fig 9 illustrates the decolorization efficiency confirming that the composite leads to a remarkable enhancement in the photocatalytic degradation under sunlight irradiation 120 min results were similar with previous tests performed with uv irradiance provided by a lamp therefore the use of solar radiation is environmentally friendly being indicated as soon efficient as the radiation provided by the lamp but with the advantage of being a renewable affordable available and free source of energy more studies should be done to optimize this treatment step 3 3 2 treatment proposal after discussing all data obtained in this study table 2 it is possible to affirm that the coupling of biological treatment with zno ppy photocatalysis constitutes a suitable environmentally friendly technology hence in fig s3 we propose a treatment sequence i the wastewater generated must be filtered in order to remove suspended solids as fabric fibers since the dyeing process is performed around at 40 100 c a temperature equalizer tank is needed ii when the wastewater has cooled down to 25 c a pump flow it to the biological reactor with minimum retention time of 96 h iii the effluent is again filtered to remove bacterial agglomerates and other suspended solids then solar photocatalysis is applied using the zno ppy composite after 2 h the effluent must pass a separator filter the treated wastewater can be discharged while the catalyst is recovered and recycled to the process 3 4 db22 degradation pathway experimental procedures were conducted at the optimum conditions defined previously according to the db22 ft ir analysis fig 10 it is possible to identify the vibration of some groups present in the fragments over the proposed sequential treatment at 3479 and 3412 cm 1 there are characteristic peaks of medium weak secondary amine n h stretches with lower intensity after 60 min of photocatalysis indicating their fragmentation the peak at 3125 cm 1 corresponds to the primary amines nh present in the db22 dye structure at 1642 and 1611 cm 1 peaks are noted for a strong stretch of tertiary amine or co which is fragmented over time the peak at 1398 cm 1 appears quite intense after photocatalysis and refers to an average asymmetric deformation of ch3 suggesting the rupture of the benzene rings peaks 1117 cm 1 and 617 cm 1 are indicative of weak stretching of alkyl amine c n and c h outside the benzene ring plane respectively fragments are very likely to react to each other and generate new species see fig 11 lc ms ms was employed for the determination of fragments fig s2 in fig s2 fragments between m z 900 and 1050 were observed to increase in intensity during the biological treatment fig s2a these fragments have reduced intensity in the photocatalytic process fig s2b and were maintained when biological treatment precedes photocatalysis fig s2c in addition during the biological treatment fig s2a fragments between m z 300 150 not identified were generated in larger quantity evidenced by the increase of their intensity whereas fragments between m z 300 900 present in the biological treatment were cleaved by free radicals o2 and oh in photocatalysis according to figure s2 it was possible to identify some fragments referring to the cleavage of dye molecule db22 by free radicals o2 and oh generated by the composite suggesting a simple fragmentation route 32 during the biological treatment it is suggested the formation of fragments similar to those described in fig 11 route a by the cleavage of terminal nitrogen groups 15 50 it is widely reported that many bacterial strains can produce specific enzymes which are capable of cleaving amino bonds afterward the microorganisms can conduct further reactions fragmenting a complex initial compound to simple molecules or even mineralization can occurs in some cases 10 13 in this case only accessible terminal nh2 nitrogen bonds are reduced in agreement with previous reports which showed that chemical structures of the dyes largely influence in their degradation and the steric hindrance by r groups would not allow the access of the enzymes to the azo bonds 51 53 during the photocatalysis process using zno ppy it is suggested that desulfonation take place first in the db22 molecules fig 11 route b 54 and then complete degradation occurs finally the results suggest that during the biological photocatalytic treatments first the microorganisms cleavage accessible nitrogen groups of db22 producing fragments about m z 524 then photocatalytic process produces the desulfonation of these fragments leading to the complete mineralization of the dye accordingly supported by the identification of m z peaks corresponding to db22 we propose that biological treatment is responsible for the route a shown in fig 11 also this hypothesis is reinforced by ph which decreases 9 54 initial to 6 69 after 96 h possibly due to the formation of sulfonic acid 55 the results are in accordance with toc analysis which implies that the pollutants were mineralized no reports of toxicity of fragments generated by the coupled biological treatment process followed by photocatalysis as suggested in this paper were found 4 conclusion a real textile wastewater treatment method coupling biological and photocatalytic treatments was proposed in this work after biological treatment a decolorization of 71 3 was obtained with a decrease of ph the biological treatment is a key step to then photocatalytic process can act efficiently without high time consuming and with a reduction of the use of uv lamp sequentially applying the photocatalysis process was able to improve the decolorization resulting in a total decolorization efficiency of 95 7 whereas the final toc removal reached remarkable 99 8 in addition the use of solar photocatalysis gives promising results showing that uv lamp could be replaced by solar radiation a simple dye fragmentation route was proposed where the bacterial consortium cleavage the terminal nitrogen groups of db22 probably by azo reductase activity and then photocatalytic process produces the desulfonation of the dye by the oh and o2 radicals generated by the composite the composite was evaluated in 3 reuse cycles with similar efficiency without structural modifications in composite the coupling of biological and photocatalytic treatments have shown to be a promising
