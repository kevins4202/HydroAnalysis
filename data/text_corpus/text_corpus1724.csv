8620,over the past 15 years there has been a proliferation of projects aiming to restore the structure and function of uk upland blanket mires primarily by revegetation of bare peat and the blocking of erosion gullies these restoration measures have potential to alter stormflow responses and contribute to natural flood management but their impacts on storm hydrographs are poorly quantified this paper reports a before after control intervention baci study from three experimental headwater micro catchments in the south pennines uk representing the first rigorous experimental assessment of the impact of blanket peat restoration on catchment runoff we evaluate the hydrological impacts of two standard restoration interventions revegetation of bare peat and revegetation of bare peat with additional gully blocking following revegetation there was a significant decrease in depth to water table and an increase in the prevalence of hillslope overland flow production there were no significant changes in storm runoff coefficient following either restoration treatment storm hydrographs following revegetation had significantly longer lag times 106 increase relative to the control reduced peak flows 27 decrease relative to the control and attenuated hydrograph shapes with the addition of gully blocking the effect is almost doubled lag times increased by a further 94 and peak flows reduced by an additional 24 relative to the control we argue that the primary process controlling the observed changes in storm hydrograph behaviour is retardation of overland stormflow due to increased surface roughness the significant changes to lag times and peak flow provide evidence that the restoration of degraded headwater peatlands can contribute to natural flood management and the reduction of downstream flood risk subject to wider catchment scale effects and sub catchment storm hydrograph synchronicity keywords flood risk management natural flood management re vegetation gully blocking water tables peatland hydrology 1 introduction approximately 500 000 km2 12 of global peatlands are severely degraded through human activity joosten 2016 there has been growing interest in the hydrological processes controlling runoff from both degraded and restored peatlands e g price et al 2016 including studies from cutover peats in europe kl√∏ve and bengtsson 1999 and north america e g shantz and price 2006 price and ketcheson 2009 and ditched or eroded blanket peats in north america e g price 1992 the uk and ireland burke 1975 holden and burt 2003 holden et al 2006 luscombe et al 2015 in the uk headwater catchments are characterised by extensive blanket peat cover and have been subject to significant climatic and anthropogenic pressures bonn et al 2009 ramchunder et al 2009 clark et al 2010 this has led to wide spread ecosystem degradation in the form of erosion drainage pollution and wildfire damage evans and warburton 2007 parry et al 2014 upland blanket mires are therefore amongst the most damaged ecosystems in the uk with many peatland headwaters severely eroded large areas of bare peat and extensive erosional gully networks are common including the north and south pennines tallis 1997 garnett and adamson 1997 north and mid wales yeo 1997 ellis and tallis 2001 and scotland grieve et al 1994 with peatland erosion reported across 10 30 of the total uk blanket peat area evans and warburton 2007 blanket peatlands are hydrologically flashy systems in hydrologically intact systems water tables are typically close to the ground surface evans et al 1999 so that soil water storage is limited and rapid saturation excess overland flow is generated in response to significant rainfall events stream flow responds rapidly to rainfall events producing relatively short hydrograph lag times and high peak flows relative to total storm runoff volumes evans et al 1999 holden and burt 2003 peatland degradation and erosion through loss of vegetation cover and or gully development further increases the flashiness of stream flow response where vegetation is removed surface roughness decreases leading to increased hillslope overland flow velocities and faster delivery of hillslope drainage into channels holden et al 2008 bare peat surfaces may also develop hydrophobic properties eggelsmann et al 1993 evans et al 1999 and be subject to surface compaction by raindrop action this can reduce infiltration rates and increase infiltration excess overland flow production in high intensity rainfall events the formation of gully networks increases drainage density hillslope channel connectivity and catchment drainage efficiency evans and warburton 2007 peat erosion can therefore result in flashier storm hydrographs and higher storm flow peaks which have been linked to increased flood risk downstream baird et al 1997 grayson et al 2010 over the past 15 years restoration of upland blanket peatlands in the uk has been extensive evans et al 2005 wallage et al 2006 armstrong et al 2010 parry et al 2014 including landscape scale restoration through the re vegetation of bare peat and the blocking of erosion gullies anderson et al 2009 recent studies of the effects of restoration have focussed on carbon release e g dixon et al 2013 vegetation recovery e g cole et al 2014 and sediment dynamics e g shuttleworth et al 2015 but relatively little is known about the effects of restoration on hydrological behaviour natural flood management nfm describes the restoration of natural hydrological functions in damaged systems with the aim of reducing downstream flood risk dadson et al 2017 restoration of eroding peatlands has the potential to modify hydrological functioning through changes in storm flow runoff generation processes runoff pathways and catchment storage c f acreman and holden 2013 consequently there is growing interest in the extent to which blanket peat restoration may regulate storm flows to downstream areas e g bain et al 2011 spatial averaging which occurs in catchments means that nfm benefits have been difficult to evidence in large catchments 20 km2 dadson et al 2017 however flood risk in upland catchments is commonly associated with the flashy response of small headwater systems wilkinson et al 2013 plotscale experimental work by holden et al 2008 demonstrated the potential importance of vegetation related changes in surface roughness as a control on runoff velocities and grayson et al 2010 reported correlations between long term vegetation change and changes in hydrograph form in naturally re vegetating peatlands peatland re vegetation may therefore be beneficial to nfm through changes in stormwater storage and or the attenuation of flow gully blocking may also reduce runoff through the addition of pool storage or reduction in channel flow velocities due to increased channel roughness these considerations suggest that peatland restoration can delay and or reduce stormflow from headwater catchments however eroded blanket peats also have depressed water tables daniels et al 2008 allott et al 2009 and there has been concern that raising water tables through restoration may reduce hillslope storage and increase runoff as observed by shantz and price 2006 at a restored peat extraction site in canada despite the large scale implementation of peatland restoration the impacts of re vegetation and gully blocking on runoff have not been quantified parry et al 2014 a more complete understanding of the impact of restoration on hillslope hydrology is required to determine the potential for peatland restoration to deliver nfm benefits this paper investigates changes in hydrological behaviour associated with blanket peat restoration by re vegetation of bare peat and gully blocking using three micro catchments situated on the kinder plateau peak district national park pdnp uk this study has two objectives i to quantify the impacts of peatland re vegetation on water tables and overland flow ii to quantify the impacts of peatland re vegetation and gully blocking on storm hydrograph behaviour these objectives provide the structural sub headings used in the following methods and results sections the discussion section then reflects on the processes responsible for the observed changes and how our findings contribute to wider debates surrounding the role of peatland restoration in nfm 2 study site and experimental design 2 1 field area the field experiment took place on the kinder scout plateau in the southern pennines uk kinder scout represents one of the most severely eroded areas of blanket peat in the uk tallis 1997 characterised by networks of erosion gullies and prior to restoration extensive areas of bare peat flats pilkington et al 2015 peat depths of 2 2 5 m overlie a sandstone bedrock from the millstone grit series mgs wolverson cope 1976 and fine grained head deposits of weathered mgs shales rothwell et al 2005 mean monthly temperatures recorded at the nearby upper north grain weather station vary between 13 2 c july and 1 6 c february mean annual rainfall is 1313 mm and the prevailing wind direction is wsw 254 clay and evans 2017 in 2011 12 an 84 ha area on the north side of kinder plateau was selected for peatland restoration as part of the making space for water demonstration project pilkington et al 2015 approximately 34 28 ha of this area consisted of severe gully erosion and bare peat extant vegetation cover prior to restoration was dominated by vacciunium myrtillus empetrum nigrum heath on higher elevation peat hags with some additional areas of eriophorum angustifolium 2 2 restoration activities the restoration treatments followed protocols developed and applied in landscape scale restoration across the south pennines by the moors for the future partnership buckler et al 2013 the restoration methodology and revegetation outcomes are summarised here full details of treatments for the study micro catchments including application rates fertilizer doses and seed mix composition are provided in pilkington et al 2015 restoration by re vegetation of bare peat uses lime seed and fertilizer and a cut heather mulch to establish a nurse crop mainly composed of amenity grasses to provide initial ground cover this stabilises the peat surface and provides the conditions for longer term succession of native peatland plant species see anderson et al 2009 revegetation on kinder consisted of five principal treatment stages pilkington et al 2015 i heather brash was spread by hand on areas of bare peat in march 2011 ii granulated lime was applied on 20th july 2011 by helicopter suspended hopper iii granulated npk nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizer was applied by helicopter on 21st july 2011 iv a treatment of seeds of amenity grasses local grasses and dwarf shrubs were applied by helicopter on 21st july 2011 v maintenance treatments of npk fertilizer were made by helicopter in june 2012 and july 2013 restoration by gully blocking involves installing c 0 5 m high stone dams composed of millstone grit cobbles 75 200 mm diameter across the width of the gully in the main gully stem c 6 7 m apart timber dams are also used in smaller tributary gullies constructed with a 38 mm deep v notch cut into the top board to promote flow over the centre on kinder stone dams were installed in winter 2011 12 and timber dams were installed in february april 2012 post restoration establishment of vegetation cover between 2011 and 2014 is reported in pilkington et al 2015 aerial photography indicates that areas of bare peat cover across the site decreased by 76 between 2009 and 2014 at restored sites quadrat surveys conducted in 2010 and 2014 showed change from zero vegetation cover to 39 grass cover including the amenity grasses lolium perenne festuca ovina and agrostis castellana present in the applied seed mix 27 acrocarpus moss spp 11 calluna vulgaris 6 plearocarpous moss spp 3 rumex acetosella 4 polytricum spp and 2 liverwort spp pilkington et al 2015 there was also 34 cover of dead plant material almost complete cover by nurse crop had therefore established during this period including on the floors of gullies with remaining areas of bare peat confined largely to the steep gully walls no significant changes in vegetation cover were observed at a 150 200 m area to the east of the plateau that was left unrestored as a control pilkington et al 2015 2 3 experimental design we use a before after control impact baci design using data generated over a five year period from three micro catchments three micro catchments were selected to have comparable geometry and erosion and gully characteristics table 1 using dem s 2 m resolution lidar gully maps evans and lindsay 2010 and field verification fig 1 one site f was left bare to act as a control while the other two o and n revegetated during the restoration period gully blocks were also installed at site n a total of 17 stone dams were installed along a 120 m section of the main channel and 20 wooden dams were installed in smaller tributary gullies intensive monitoring started in june 2010 and covered a pre restoration period of 15 months 2010 11 and 32 months post intervention 2012 2014 water tables and overland flow production were monitored to help understand changes to storage and runoff pathways and rainfall and channel flow were monitored to investigate stormflow behaviour due to the costs of landscape scale manipulations and restrictions in the availability of suitable field sites it was not possible to replicate site conditions leading to a pseudoreplicated design this is a common challenge in landscape manipulation experiments and associated statistical analysis davies and gray 2015 colegrave and ruxton 2018 and we have accounted for it by considering changes in behaviour relative to the control over multiple storm events 3 methods 3 1 field monitoring of water tables and overland flow depth to water table dtwt and the occurrence of overland flow were recorded to evaluate changes following re vegetation measurements were taken manually at weekly intervals between september and november 2010 i e pre restoration and between and september and december 2014 i e 3 years after restoration dtwt was determined using clusters of 15 dipwells located randomly within 30 30 m areas of the peatland after allott et al 2009 three dipwell clusters were established at the control bare peat site and three clusters within the two re vegetated micro catchments giving a total of 45 dipwells for each of the control and revegetation treatments all dipwells were located at least 2 m away from gully edges so that localised drawdown of water tables in proximity to erosion gullies daniels et al 2008 allott et al 2009 was not a factor each dipwell comprised a 1 m length of polypropylene waste pipe internal diameter 30 mm with perforation holes drilled at 100 mm intervals dipwells were driven into pre prepared boreholes dtwt was measured relative to the ground surface the occurrence of overland flow was detected using crest stage runoff traps holden and burt 2003 co located with the dipwell clusters three clusters of traps each containing nine tubes within a 1 m2 plot were located in the control area and three clusters in the treatment catchments tubes were sunk into the peat surface with their entry holes flush with the peat surface during sampling the number of tubes containing water was recorded before wet tubes were emptied to reset the cluster for the subsequent week of sampling the overland flow quotient ofq was calculated as the proportion of tubes recording overland flow within the sampling period 3 2 field monitoring of hydrograph behaviour v notch weirs and pressure transducers were installed at the catchment outlets pressure transducers logging at 10 min intervals recorded the depth of water mm flowing over the v notch weir which was subsequently converted to discharge and normalised to catchment area to facilitate comparison across catchments l s 1 km 2 rain gauges at each site monitored rainfall at 10 min intervals rainfall and discharge data are available for each catchment from june 2010 to september 2011 pre restoration and april 2012 to december 2014 post restoration operational issues led to periods where no data were collected for some sites resulting in gaps in the record this resulted from combinations of i severe climatic conditions including ice and severe low temperatures leading to occasional equipment failure ii delays in servicing due to site access restrictions and iii episodes of sedimentation impacting stilling pools for each catchment the available rainfall and runoff data were collated hydrographs were extracted for all rainfall events where i total rainfall exceeded 4 mm and ii rainfall occurred as a discrete event with a single associated discernible main peak in discharge complex multi peak hydrographs were excluded the rainfall and runoff data from these hydrographs were used to calculate four key metrics i lag time between peak rainfall and peak flow lag ii peak storm discharge peakq iii hydrograph shape index hsi the ratio of peak storm discharge to total storm discharge a measure of hydrograph intensity and rainfall runoff coefficient c storm flow characteristics are influenced strongly by the intensity and duration of rainfall so two rainfall characteristics were also derived to compliment the hydrograph metrics i total rainfall mm and ii maximum rainfall intensity over a 10 min interval mm h 1 3 3 hydrograph data quality control data for a total of 506 hydrographs were extracted 152 storms for catchment f 187 for o and 167 for n runoff and rainfall metrics for these storms are summarised in appendix a the full dataset covers a total of 329 storm events however this includes 223 storms where hydrographs fitting the strict selection criteria could only be extracted for a single site there were 68 storm events where hydrographs could be extracted for all three catchments as storm flow characteristics are influenced by antecedent conditions and the nature of rainfall events evans et al 1999 the mismatch in storm events in the complete data set could lead to substantial bias when comparing metrics between catchments by analysing the 204 hydrographs derived from the 68 storms events for which metrics could be extracted for all three catchments runoff behaviour resulting from similar rainfall and antecedent conditions could be compared directly this reduced dataset allows for a strict and robust comparison of the data and is the primary dataset used for all subsequent statistical analysis of hydrograph metrics there was still considerable noise in the reduced dataset due to the range of rainfall behaviours and antecedent conditions total rainfall per event ranges from 4 to 56 mm and maximum event rainfall intensity ranges from 1 8 to 54 mm h 1 leading to a wide range of runoff responses in the storm flow metrics by standardising the metrics derived at the treatment catchments against the control catchment we can differentiate responses due to restoration treatment from natural variation this was achieved by deriving the relative difference treatment minus control between the metrics produced by control and treatment sites 3 3 1 high magnitude events to assess the potential utility of peatland restoration as an nfm measure in upland catchments it is important to assess the degree to which changes in runoff delivery are maintained in high magnitude events in particular if hillslope and channel storage control runoff then nfm efficacy may be reduced in large storms since storage as a proportion of storm runoff would be minimised data from the ten biggest pre restoration and ten biggest post restoration storms total event precipitation were compared analysis of the large storm subset was based on standardised metrics from the two treatment sites relative to the control 3 4 statistical analyses many of the variables of interest do not follow a normal distribution overland flow rainfall hydrograph metrics so non parametric tests of difference were employed to determine the statistical significance of the influence of restoration where data were available for each year of the study kruskal wallis 1 way anova were used to investigate year on year changes following restoration pairwise comparisons were applied post hoc using adjusted mann whitney u tests to assess where any significant differences lie where only one year of post restoration data was available water table overland flow or the data set had been reduced to before and after data mann whitney u tests were used to investigate the effects of restoration all relationships were tested at the 95 level p 0 05 in using non parametric analyses we were unable to assess the additional benefit of gully blocking statistically as there is no non parametric equivalent of a 2 way anova which would allow us to examine the effect of two factors before after restoration and treatment type in an unbalanced dataset any impacts of gully blocking are discussed in terms of additional magnitude of change relative to re vegetation alone 4 results figures show the relative difference between the treatment and control sites treatment minus control before and following restoration positive values on the y axis therefore indicate that the metric of interest is greater at the treatment site than at the bare control while negative values indicate the opposite all parameters are discussed in terms of their median value 4 1 impacts of peatland re vegetation on water tables and overland flow in 2010 prior to restoration water tables were closer to the surface at the treatment site than at the control site dtwt were 307 and 345 mm respectively table 2 the relative difference in dtwt dtwtrel was 27 mm fig 2 a in 2014 dtwt at the control site was 342 mm comparable to the 2010 value while dtwt at the treatment site was 293 mm shallower than dtwt observed pre restoration dtwtrel had increased to 59 mm this represents a significant relative decrease in dtwt of 35 mm i e 9 relative to the control at the treatment site following re vegetation p 0 010 mann whitney u in 2010 both the treatment and control sites produced comparable amounts of overland flow median ofq of 0 19 and 0 22 respectively table 2 the relative difference in ofq ofqrel was highly variable around zero fig 2b median ofqrel was negative 0 07 demonstrating that prior to restoration the treatment site was less productive of overland flow than the control in 2014 the relationship was reversed with a positive median ofqrel value of 0 11 although this increase in overland flow at the treatment site is not statistically significant p 0 065 mann whitney u there has been a clear shift in behaviour after treatment ofqrel on all bar one measurement day was positive indicating that the re vegetated site was producing consistently more overland flow than the control 4 2 impacts of peatland re vegetation and gully blocking on hydrograph behaviour 4 2 1 annual data descriptive statistics for the four key hydrograph metrics at the three micro catchments are summarised in table 3 and the relative differences between the treatment and control sites treatment minus control are presented in fig 3 these relative differences are referred to as lagrel peakqrel hsirel and c rel groupings of statistically similar years based on kruskal wallis 1 way anova are represented by lower case letters the data suggest that restoration has had an immediate effect on three out of the four metrics at both treatment sites lagrel increased and both peakqrel and hsirel were reduced immediately after restoration there was no consistent change in c rel with post restoration values similar to pre restoration values in two of the three post treatment years following the pronounced step change in lagrel peakqrel and hsirel in 2012 there are no subsequent directional trends apparent in any of the metrics lagrel shows the clearest evidence of a consistent step change in behaviour following restoration at both treatment sites lagrel in 2010 11 i e before restoration fall into group a while all subsequent years fall into group b fig 3a and b lagrel pre restoration was therefore significantly different to lagrel post restoration and lagrel was statistically similar in the three years following restoration similar groupings can be seen for hsirel fig 3e and f a step change is apparent but less pronounced for peakqrel with the two treatment sites producing different groupings at the re vegetated site o the two years following treatment are distinct from the pre restoration period group b but 2014 produced similar peakqrel to the pre restoration period group a fig 3c at the re vegetated and blocked site n the three years post treatment are similar group b but the year immediately after restoration 2012 can also be grouped with the pre restoration period group a fig 3d the high post restoration peakqrel in 2014 coincides with anomalously high relative crel values at the same site fig 3g indicating that variation in peakqrel is non random the simplest explanation of the trends observed in the data is a step change in lagrel peakqrel and hsirel in response to restoration subsequent variability is interpreted as inter annual noise resulting from variation across the storms available for analysis based on this interpretation we combine the three years of post restoration data into a single after restoration dataset to determine the average magnitude of the changes in hydrograph behaviour following restoration 4 2 2 baci analysis prior to treatment hydrographs at the three sites behaved in a similar manner table 4 lag ranged between 15 and 30 min peakq was between 490 and 750 l s 1 km 2 hsi ranged between 0 16 and 0 20 and c was between 40 and 48 there were no significant differences in hydrograph metrics at the three sites before treatment kruskal wallis 1 way anova p 0 05 for all parameters however it should be noted that sites f and o were consistently at opposite ends of these ranges with site o displaying flashier flow characteristics shorter lag times higher peakq consistent with its smaller catchment area table 1 before restoration lagrel at site o re vegetation only was 10 min fig 4 a lag was 61 of that at the control site following restoration lagrel increased to 10 min and lag was on average 167 of the control this represents a statistically significant increase in lagrel of 20 min or a 106 increase in lag relative to the control p 0 001 mann whitney u at site n re vegetation with additional gully blocks prior to restoration lagrel was 0 i e lag was on average the same length as at the control site following restoration lagrel increased to 30 min and lag was on average 300 of the control this represents a statistically significant increase in lagrel of 30 min or a 200 increase in lag relative to the control p 0 001 mann whitney u prior to restoration peakqrel at site o was 131 l s 1 km 2 fig 4b peakq was 129 that of the control site following restoration peakqrel decreased to 12 l s 1 km 2 indicating that peak discharges were roughly the same as the control this represents a statistically significant decrease in peakqrel of 143 l s 1 km 2 or a 27 decrease in peakq relative to the control p 0 001 mann whitney u at site n in the pre restoration period peakqrel was 55 l s 1 km 2 peakq was similar to the control site 108 following restoration peakqrel decreased to 200 l s 1 km 2 and peakq was only 57 of the control this represents a statistically significant 255 l s 1 km 2 decrease in peakqrel or a 51 decrease in peakq relative to the control p 0 001 mann whitney u during the pre restoration period hsirel at site o was 0 024 fig 4c hsi was 117 of the control site following restoration hsirel decreased to 0 038 so hsi was 80 of the control this represents a statistically significant decrease in hsirel of 0 062 or a 37 decrease in hsi relative to the control p 0 001 mann whitney u following restoration at site n hsirel was 0 005 i e hsi was similar to the control site 107 following restoration hsirel decreased to 0 059 and hsi was 69 of the control this represents a statistically significant decrease in hsirel of 0 064 or a 38 decrease in hsi relative to the control p 0 001 mann whitney u there was no change in c rel at either site following restoration pn 0 676 and po 0 888 mann whitney u before intervention the c rel at site o was 4 5 indicating that it was more productive of runoff than the control following restoration c rel increased slightly to 7 2 c rel at site n was 0 36 prior to restoration indicating that runoff production was similar to the control site following restoration c rel fell slightly to 2 3 this represents shifts in c rel of 2 7 and 2 6 at sites o and n respectively however it is clear from the graph in fig 4d that post restoration c rel at both sites is well within the range of pre restoration values so it is unsurprising that this variation is not statistically significant installing gully blocks in addition to re vegetation as part of the restoration treatment increased lagrel by a further 10 min i e lag increased by an extra 94 relative to the control and decreased peakqrel by an additional 112 l s 1 km 2 i e peakq decreased by a further 24 relative to the control however the gully blocks did not have any additional effect on the magnitude of change in hsirel which decreased by 37 and 38 at the treatment sites following restoration 4 2 3 high magnitude storms the magnitude of the effects of restoration practices were also investigated for the largest storms in the dataset summarised in table 5 to test if the effects of the intervention were still evident under more extreme rainfall conditions storm magnitudes ranged between 11 and 36 mm total precipitation before restoration and 15 and 56 mm after intervention appendix b the relative differences between the treatment and control sites treatment minus control for each metric are shown in fig 5 all parameters discussed in this section are median values as in the main dataset there was a statistically significant increase in lagrel at both of the treatment sites during high magnitude storms fig 5a po 0 019 and pn 0 035 mann whitney u while the scale of change at site o was similar to that of the full dataset the magnitude of change at site n was considerably less than when considering all storms for large storms lagrel at site o increased by 25 min 109 increase in lag similar to the main dataset where lagrel increased by 20 min 106 increase in lag however at site n lagrel only increased by 10 min during large storms representing a 25 increase in lag much less than the 200 increase in lag in the full dataset there was also a statistically significant decrease in peakqrel at both treatment sites during large storms fig 5b po 0 019 and pn 0 035 mann whitney u the magnitude of change in peakq at site o was smaller than that of the full dataset 17 versus 27 while at site n it was similar to the main dataset 56 versus 57 hsirel was also reduced for large storms fig 5c by 28 at site o and 26 at site n this was less than when considering all storms 37 and 38 and this shift in hydrograph shape post restoration was not statistically significant po 0 075 and pn 0 143 mann whitney u unlike the full data set crel was reduced at both treatment sites during large storms following restoration fig 5d but these reductions were not statistically significant po 0 971 and pn 0 123 mann whitney u 5 discussion 5 1 the impact of restoration on runoff generation restoration has had a pronounced effect on the hydrology of the peatland headwater catchments producing marked changes in water table depth runoff production and storm flow behaviour restoration by re vegetation raised water tables by 35 mm after three years re wetting the treated areas which in turn increased the incidence of overland flow relative to un treated sites re vegetation has also had an immediate and significant impact on storm hydrograph characteristics increasing lag times by 106 and decreasing peak storm discharge by 27 and hsi by 37 gully blocking enhances the benefits of re vegetation with lag times increased by a further 94 and peak storm discharge reduced by an additional 24 relative to the control however gully blocking does not appear to alter the flashiness of stormflow as hsi was reduced by a similar proportion at both of the treatment sites neither of the treatments have had any impact on the proportion of storm event rainfall that becomes storm discharge c the changes to hydrograph behaviour post restoration are still evident during large storms fig 5 albeit to a lesser extent for some parameters indicating that the changes in runoff delivery are maintained in high magnitude events the observed hydrological impacts of restoration in peatland headwaters therefore have the potential to alter downstream stormflow behaviour and reduce flood risk we acknowledge that our results are based on a limited number of sites and that replicating our experiments at different locations would strengthen our findings however our data corresponds with findings from observational and modelling studies providing confidence that our results are more generally valid for example grayson et al 2010 observed c 20 reductions in peak discharge due to natural revegetation in a blanket peatland in the north pennines gao et al 2016 modelled the impacts of vegetation cover on riparian strips on peatland stormflow in blanket peatlands in england and wales using comparable rainfall intensities to those observed in our study and found that bare riparian zones increased peak flow by up to 20 while sphagnum covered ground reduced peak flow by up to 13 similarly pan and shangguan 2006 observed 14 25 reductions in runoff by adding grass to bare soil in a plot study of loessial loam in yangling china 5 2 process controls what might be causing these changes in runoff generation 5 2 1 water tables and overland flow re vegetation has raised water table depth and increased incidence of overland flow over a relatively short period c 3 years but not yet to levels comparable with intact peatlands c f evans et al 1999 holden et al 2006 water table recovery has been widely documented in peatlands where artificial drains have been blocked e g shantz and price 2006 wilson et al 2010 haapalehto et al 2011 holden et al 2011 menberu et al 2016 however the present study provides the first example of re vegetation alone improving water table condition in blanket peatlands water table rises under re vegetation could be driven by a range of potential mechanisms the insulating properties of newly established vegetation cover may reduce evaporative losses cf grayson et al 2010 price et al 1998 found that net radiation and soil heat flux were greater over bare peat when compared to mulched surfaces attributing this to the mulch s higher albedo so the change from dark bare peat to higher albedo re vegetated surfaces is likely having a similar effect alternatively root penetration may increase infiltration or vegetation may increase microtopographic storage there may also have been structural changes in the peat matrix over time reducing hydrophobicity and increasing the peat s ability to retain water investigations of the peat matrix combined with analyses of net radiation and evapotranspiration data are needed to distinguish between these hypotheses incidences of overland flow increased following re vegetation holden and burt 2003 show that saturation excess overland flow is the dominated runoff mechanism in an intact peatland in the northern pennines and work by evans et al 1999 suggests that this is linked to the reactive nature of peatland water tables to precipitation increased overland flow is therefore consistent with the declines in depth to water table discussed above however re vegetation has not restored runoff conditions to those of the intact site reported in holden and burt 2003 suggesting that incomplete water table recovery constrained by the fact that topography is not returned to pre erosion form by the restoration holden et al 2006 limits runoff recovery despite the observed increase in overland flow and apparent reduced storage capacity due to rising water tables percentage runoff values have not changed following restoration indicating that there is no significant change in catchment storage during storm events peatlands characteristically have low specific yields price 1996 so that the change in storage associated with small changes in water table in this instance appears to be within measurement noise 5 2 2 hydrograph response the runoff coefficient shows no change following re vegetation implying that hillslope storage is not altered despite there being no change in long term storage the rate of delivery of runoff has been reduced as illustrated by increased lag times and attenuated hydrograph shapes grayson et al 2010 observed similar changes in hydrograph behaviour at a naturally revegetated peatland site in the north pennines this is likely due to increased surface roughness provided by the newly established vegetation cf holden et al 2008 pan and shangguan 2006 gully blocking enhances the impacts of re vegetation on peak discharge and lag time but there was no significant change in runoff coefficient in the blocked catchment indicating that there has been no gain in storage through ponding behind gully blocks cf evans et al 2005 this is perhaps surprising but indicates that the additional changes in stormflow hydrographs associated with the gully blocking in this study are driven by the introduction of large scale roughness elements to the channel it should be noted that this does not mean that gully blocking lacks the potential to increase catchment storage the findings presented here are based on a single catchment with a particular arrangement of blocks and the optimal approaches to block design and spacing are yet to be determined adjusting the number of blocks and their spacing and design has the potential to further attenuate stormflow and increase catchment storage milledge et al 2015 the trajectory of hydrograph response in gullied systems will also require evaluation given the relatively short time period represented in the current analysis and the potential for longer term effects associated with gully infilling and revegetation comparison with hydrological data emerging from other gully blocked peat systems such as the high elevation peats of the tibetan plateau zhang et al 2012 2016 will be instructive 5 3 wider implications the data we present provide the first controlled catchment scale experimental evidence that hydraulic roughness controlled by vegetation cover drives the rainfall runoff response in blanket peatlands cf grayson et al 2010 the establishment of the nurse crop has had an immediate i e within one growing season impact on stormflow characteristics with no further trends in the subsequent years fig 3 however based on the work of holden et al 2008 it is reasonable to assume that surface roughness and hence the rainfall runoff response will be further modified over longer time scales as the vegetation matures and natural blanket bog species return the fact that the roughness effect dominates runoff as opposed to storage means that it persists in high magnitude storm events fig 5 this is an important finding in terms of nfm especially in headwater catchments where overland flow and flow depths are relatively shallow 5 3 1 restoration and land management these findings have implications beyond simply re vegetating areas of bare peat sphagnum is regarded as a keystone species in peatlands rochefort 2000 gorham and rochefort 2003 due to its role in bog building and maintaining high water tables and acidic conditions and its reintroduction is becoming a priority in blanket peat restoration initiatives in plot experiments holden et al 2008 demonstrated that sphagnum had the greatest impact on slowing overland flow velocities only c 10 that of bare ground so widespread reintroduction has the potential to make a major contribution to nfm especially if strategically targeted in riparian zones gao et al 2016 similarly other land management practices which alter vegetation cover such as the creation of clough woodland grazing anderson and radford 1994 and prescribed burning clay et al 2009 holden et al 2015 may also impact downstream flood risk through surface roughness effects further work is needed to better quantify the effects of different land covers and uses at the catchment scale this study highlights the importance of identifying suitable control sites to underpin the results of short term less than decadal duration catchment studies the use of appropriate control has removed substantial amounts of noise in the data resulting from inter annual variation in synoptic hydrometeorology without the control site we may have incorrectly deduced a storage effect as the raw data showed a reduction in c at the treatment sites post restoration table 4 however this is not the case when c is considered relative to the control fig 4 similarly we observed lower incidence of overland flow in the treatment catchments post restoration table 2 but a substantial increase in overland flow relative to the control catchment fig 2 by assessing deviations from the control we have been able to detect the magnitude of the effect of restoration independent of synoptic conditions the control component of the baci design is therefore critical when assessing the impact of ecosystem restoration to avoid misleading results and to understand the processes driving post intervention change this is especially important when considering the policy relevance of environmental science research bilotta et al 2014 2015 and should be considered an essential element of restoration monitoring 5 3 2 downstream flood risk the significant post restoration changes in hydrology observed in this study will reduce flood risk at the headwater scale these headwater effects will propagate downstream with the potential to reduce flood risk substantially at the wider catchment scale reduction in downstream flood risk will depend on two important scale factors firstly the scale of restoration relative to the size of the catchment milledge et al 2015 and the position of restoration works in the landscape gao et al 2016 secondly the nature of catchment and sub catchment geography and associated hydrograph synchronisation effects contributes to the wider catchment hydrograph pattison et al 2014 metcalfe et al 2018 this is an important consideration for example nutt and perfect 2011 present evidence that a moorland improvement scheme designed to delay runoff in the allen water scotland may have partially synchronised sub catchment peak flows and so increased downstream flood risk conversely similar planned moorland improvement to a different sub catchment were shown to help desynchronise the runoff from this sub catchment and decrease flood risk nutt and perfect 2011 we note that restored blanket peats are located typically at the extreme upper end of drainage and catchment networks so in this context an increase in storm flow travel times from these systems would generally be expected to reduce peak flows downstream the use of monitoring approaches to evaluate these scale effects and to quantify the benefits of restoration on downstream flood risk reduction is problematic this is due to multiple influences on flow regimes in wider catchments and confounding factors making it difficult to isolate the effects of restoration within empirical storm flow datasets dadson et al 2017 it is also extremely difficult to identify suitable control systems at the large catchment scale however the benefits of restoration effects on flood risk reduction at larger catchment scales can be quantified using hydrological models e g lane and milledge 2012 the results of the current study provide the basis for realistic and robust hydrological modelling of downstream flood risk change the study has quantified changes in lag times and peak flows from headwaters associated with restoration and has demonstrated the hydrological processes that underlie these effects these two factors permit appropriate model formulation and calibration e g milledge et al 2015 but further catchment scale studies are required to better inform modelling assessments 6 conclusion this study has adopted a paired catchment approach within a baci design to demonstrate that re vegetation of bare peat and gully blocking reduces rates of hillslope runoff from blanket peatland water tables have become shallower and the incidence of overland flow has increased but this has not significantly affected the volume of storm runoff produced peak discharges are reduced and lag times are increased despite there being no overall change in catchment storage this is consistent with reduced hillslope runoff velocities due to increases in surface roughness provided by the newly established vegetation and gully blocks modifications in peatland vegetation cover and drainage whether deliberate or as a consequence of changing land use and management regimes will have consequences in terms of downstream flood risk the significant magnitude of the changes detailed in this study demonstrates that there is a clear and convincing evidence base to develop the role of peatland restoration techniques within the nfm framework operationalising these findings will require upscaling of the evidence from this study but the empirical data presented here and the finding that runoff delivery rather than storage is key provides a basis for modelling the potential impacts at larger scales until now investment in peatland restoration has been justified by reference to enhanced biodiversity and to the role of peatlands in carbon storage our findings suggest that these large scale modifications of upland landscapes may also play a role in protecting communities from flooding adding to the multiple

8620,over the past 15 years there has been a proliferation of projects aiming to restore the structure and function of uk upland blanket mires primarily by revegetation of bare peat and the blocking of erosion gullies these restoration measures have potential to alter stormflow responses and contribute to natural flood management but their impacts on storm hydrographs are poorly quantified this paper reports a before after control intervention baci study from three experimental headwater micro catchments in the south pennines uk representing the first rigorous experimental assessment of the impact of blanket peat restoration on catchment runoff we evaluate the hydrological impacts of two standard restoration interventions revegetation of bare peat and revegetation of bare peat with additional gully blocking following revegetation there was a significant decrease in depth to water table and an increase in the prevalence of hillslope overland flow production there were no significant changes in storm runoff coefficient following either restoration treatment storm hydrographs following revegetation had significantly longer lag times 106 increase relative to the control reduced peak flows 27 decrease relative to the control and attenuated hydrograph shapes with the addition of gully blocking the effect is almost doubled lag times increased by a further 94 and peak flows reduced by an additional 24 relative to the control we argue that the primary process controlling the observed changes in storm hydrograph behaviour is retardation of overland stormflow due to increased surface roughness the significant changes to lag times and peak flow provide evidence that the restoration of degraded headwater peatlands can contribute to natural flood management and the reduction of downstream flood risk subject to wider catchment scale effects and sub catchment storm hydrograph synchronicity keywords flood risk management natural flood management re vegetation gully blocking water tables peatland hydrology 1 introduction approximately 500 000 km2 12 of global peatlands are severely degraded through human activity joosten 2016 there has been growing interest in the hydrological processes controlling runoff from both degraded and restored peatlands e g price et al 2016 including studies from cutover peats in europe kl√∏ve and bengtsson 1999 and north america e g shantz and price 2006 price and ketcheson 2009 and ditched or eroded blanket peats in north america e g price 1992 the uk and ireland burke 1975 holden and burt 2003 holden et al 2006 luscombe et al 2015 in the uk headwater catchments are characterised by extensive blanket peat cover and have been subject to significant climatic and anthropogenic pressures bonn et al 2009 ramchunder et al 2009 clark et al 2010 this has led to wide spread ecosystem degradation in the form of erosion drainage pollution and wildfire damage evans and warburton 2007 parry et al 2014 upland blanket mires are therefore amongst the most damaged ecosystems in the uk with many peatland headwaters severely eroded large areas of bare peat and extensive erosional gully networks are common including the north and south pennines tallis 1997 garnett and adamson 1997 north and mid wales yeo 1997 ellis and tallis 2001 and scotland grieve et al 1994 with peatland erosion reported across 10 30 of the total uk blanket peat area evans and warburton 2007 blanket peatlands are hydrologically flashy systems in hydrologically intact systems water tables are typically close to the ground surface evans et al 1999 so that soil water storage is limited and rapid saturation excess overland flow is generated in response to significant rainfall events stream flow responds rapidly to rainfall events producing relatively short hydrograph lag times and high peak flows relative to total storm runoff volumes evans et al 1999 holden and burt 2003 peatland degradation and erosion through loss of vegetation cover and or gully development further increases the flashiness of stream flow response where vegetation is removed surface roughness decreases leading to increased hillslope overland flow velocities and faster delivery of hillslope drainage into channels holden et al 2008 bare peat surfaces may also develop hydrophobic properties eggelsmann et al 1993 evans et al 1999 and be subject to surface compaction by raindrop action this can reduce infiltration rates and increase infiltration excess overland flow production in high intensity rainfall events the formation of gully networks increases drainage density hillslope channel connectivity and catchment drainage efficiency evans and warburton 2007 peat erosion can therefore result in flashier storm hydrographs and higher storm flow peaks which have been linked to increased flood risk downstream baird et al 1997 grayson et al 2010 over the past 15 years restoration of upland blanket peatlands in the uk has been extensive evans et al 2005 wallage et al 2006 armstrong et al 2010 parry et al 2014 including landscape scale restoration through the re vegetation of bare peat and the blocking of erosion gullies anderson et al 2009 recent studies of the effects of restoration have focussed on carbon release e g dixon et al 2013 vegetation recovery e g cole et al 2014 and sediment dynamics e g shuttleworth et al 2015 but relatively little is known about the effects of restoration on hydrological behaviour natural flood management nfm describes the restoration of natural hydrological functions in damaged systems with the aim of reducing downstream flood risk dadson et al 2017 restoration of eroding peatlands has the potential to modify hydrological functioning through changes in storm flow runoff generation processes runoff pathways and catchment storage c f acreman and holden 2013 consequently there is growing interest in the extent to which blanket peat restoration may regulate storm flows to downstream areas e g bain et al 2011 spatial averaging which occurs in catchments means that nfm benefits have been difficult to evidence in large catchments 20 km2 dadson et al 2017 however flood risk in upland catchments is commonly associated with the flashy response of small headwater systems wilkinson et al 2013 plotscale experimental work by holden et al 2008 demonstrated the potential importance of vegetation related changes in surface roughness as a control on runoff velocities and grayson et al 2010 reported correlations between long term vegetation change and changes in hydrograph form in naturally re vegetating peatlands peatland re vegetation may therefore be beneficial to nfm through changes in stormwater storage and or the attenuation of flow gully blocking may also reduce runoff through the addition of pool storage or reduction in channel flow velocities due to increased channel roughness these considerations suggest that peatland restoration can delay and or reduce stormflow from headwater catchments however eroded blanket peats also have depressed water tables daniels et al 2008 allott et al 2009 and there has been concern that raising water tables through restoration may reduce hillslope storage and increase runoff as observed by shantz and price 2006 at a restored peat extraction site in canada despite the large scale implementation of peatland restoration the impacts of re vegetation and gully blocking on runoff have not been quantified parry et al 2014 a more complete understanding of the impact of restoration on hillslope hydrology is required to determine the potential for peatland restoration to deliver nfm benefits this paper investigates changes in hydrological behaviour associated with blanket peat restoration by re vegetation of bare peat and gully blocking using three micro catchments situated on the kinder plateau peak district national park pdnp uk this study has two objectives i to quantify the impacts of peatland re vegetation on water tables and overland flow ii to quantify the impacts of peatland re vegetation and gully blocking on storm hydrograph behaviour these objectives provide the structural sub headings used in the following methods and results sections the discussion section then reflects on the processes responsible for the observed changes and how our findings contribute to wider debates surrounding the role of peatland restoration in nfm 2 study site and experimental design 2 1 field area the field experiment took place on the kinder scout plateau in the southern pennines uk

flats pilkington et al 2015 peat depths of 2 2 5 m overlie a sandstone bedrock from the millstone grit series mgs wolverson cope 1976 and fine grained head deposits of weathered mgs shales rothwell et al 2005 mean monthly temperatures recorded at the nearby upper north grain weather station vary between 13 2 c july and 1 6 c february mean annual rainfall is 1313 mm and the prevailing wind direction is wsw 254 clay and evans 2017 in 2011 12 an 84 ha area on the north side of kinder plateau was selected for peatland restoration as part of the making space for water demonstration project pilkington et al 2015 approximately 34 28 ha of this area consisted of severe gully erosion and bare peat extant vegetation cover prior to restoration was dominated by vacciunium myrtillus empetrum nigrum heath on higher elevation peat hags with some additional areas of eriophorum angustifolium 2 2 restoration activities the restoration treatments followed protocols developed and applied in landscape scale restoration across the south pennines by the moors for the future partnership buckler et al 2013 the restoration methodology and revegetation outcomes are summarised here full details of treatments for the study micro catchments including application rates fertilizer doses and seed mix composition are provided in pilkington et al 2015 restoration by re vegetation of bare peat uses lime seed and fertilizer and a cut heather mulch to establish a nurse crop mainly composed of amenity grasses to provide initial ground cover this stabilises the peat surface and provides the conditions for longer term succession of native peatland plant species see anderson et al 2009 revegetation on kinder consisted of five principal treatment stages pilkington et al 2015 i heather brash was spread by hand on areas of bare peat in march 2011 ii granulated lime was applied on 20th july 2011 by helicopter suspended hopper iii granulated npk nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizer was applied by helicopter on 21st july 2011 iv a treatment of seeds of amenity grasses local grasses and dwarf shrubs were applied by helicopter on 21st july 2011 v maintenance treatments of npk fertilizer were made by helicopter in june 2012 and july 2013 restoration by gully blocking involves installing c 0 5 m high stone dams composed of millstone grit cobbles 75 200 mm diameter across the width of the gully in the main gully stem c 6 7 m apart timber dams are also used in smaller tributary gullies constructed with a 38 mm deep v notch cut into the top board to promote flow over the centre on kinder stone dams were installed in winter 2011 12 and timber dams were installed in february april 2012 post restoration establishment of vegetation cover between 2011 and 2014 is reported in pilkington et al 2015 aerial photography indicates that areas of bare peat cover across the site decreased by 76 between 2009 and 2014 at restored sites quadrat surveys conducted in 2010 and 2014 showed change from zero vegetation cover to 39 grass cover including the amenity grasses lolium perenne festuca ovina and agrostis castellana present in the applied seed mix 27 acrocarpus moss spp 11 calluna vulgaris 6 plearocarpous moss spp 3 rumex acetosella 4 polytricum spp and 2 liverwort spp pilkington et al 2015 there was also 34 cover of dead plant material almost complete cover by nurse crop had therefore established during this period including on the floors of gullies with remaining areas of bare peat confined largely to the steep gully walls no significant changes in vegetation cover were observed at a 150 200 m area to the east of the plateau that was left unrestored as a control pilkington et al 2015 2 3 experimental design we use a before after control impact baci design using data generated over a five year period from three micro catchments three micro catchments were selected to have comparable geometry and erosion and gully characteristics table 1 using dem s 2 m resolution lidar gully maps evans and lindsay 2010 and field verification fig 1 one site f was left bare to act as a control while the other two o and n revegetated during the restoration period gully blocks were also installed at site n a total of 17 stone dams were installed along a 120 m section of the main channel and 20 wooden dams were installed in smaller tributary gullies intensive monitoring started in june 2010 and covered a pre restoration period of 15 months 2010 11 and 32 months post intervention 2012 2014 water tables and overland flow production were monitored to help understand changes to storage and runoff pathways and rainfall and channel flow were monitored to investigate stormflow behaviour due to the costs of landscape scale manipulations and restrictions in the availability of suitable field sites it was not possible to replicate site conditions leading to a pseudoreplicated design this is a common challenge in landscape manipulation experiments and associated statistical analysis davies and gray 2015 colegrave and ruxton 2018 and we have accounted for it by considering changes in behaviour relative to the control over multiple storm events 3 methods 3 1 field monitoring of water tables and overland flow depth to water table dtwt and the occurrence of overland flow were recorded to evaluate changes following re vegetation measurements were taken manually at weekly intervals between september and november 2010 i e pre restoration and between and september and december 2014 i e 3 years after restoration dtwt was determined using clusters of 15 dipwells located randomly within 30 30 m areas of the peatland after allott et al 2009 three dipwell clusters were established at the control bare peat site and three clusters within the two re vegetated micro catchments giving a total of 45 dipwells for each of the control and revegetation treatments all dipwells were located at least 2 m away from gully edges so that localised drawdown of water tables in proximity to erosion gullies daniels et al 2008 allott et al 2009 was not a factor each dipwell comprised a 1 m length of polypropylene waste pipe internal diameter 30 mm with perforation holes drilled at 100 mm intervals dipwells were driven into pre prepared boreholes dtwt was measured relative to the ground surface the occurrence of overland flow was detected using crest stage runoff traps holden and burt 2003 co located with the dipwell clusters three clusters of traps each containing nine tubes within a 1 m2 plot were located in the control area and three clusters in the treatment catchments tubes were sunk into the peat surface with their entry holes flush with the peat surface during sampling the number of tubes containing water was recorded before wet tubes were emptied to reset the cluster for the subsequent week of sampling the overland flow quotient ofq was calculated as the proportion of tubes recording overland flow within the sampling period 3 2 field monitoring of hydrograph behaviour v notch weirs and pressure transducers were installed at the catchment outlets pressure transducers logging at 10 min intervals recorded the depth of water mm flowing over the v notch weir which was subsequently converted to discharge and normalised to catchment area to facilitate comparison across catchments l s 1 km 2 rain gauges at each site monitored rainfall at 10 min intervals rainfall and discharge data are available for each catchment from june 2010 to september 2011 pre restoration and april 2012 to december 2014 post restoration operational issues led to periods where no data were collected for some sites resulting in gaps in the record this resulted from combinations of i severe climatic conditions including ice and severe low temperatures leading to occasional equipment failure ii delays in servicing due to site access restrictions and iii episodes of sedimentation impacting stilling pools for each catchment the available rainfall and runoff data were collated hydrographs were extracted for all rainfall events where i total rainfall exceeded 4 mm and ii rainfall occurred as a discrete event with a single associated discernible main peak in discharge complex multi peak hydrographs were excluded the rainfall and runoff data from these hydrographs were used to calculate four key metrics i lag time between peak rainfall and peak flow lag ii peak storm discharge peakq iii hydrograph shape index hsi the ratio of peak storm discharge to total storm discharge a measure of hydrograph intensity and rainfall runoff coefficient c storm flow characteristics are influenced strongly by the intensity and duration of rainfall so two rainfall characteristics were also derived to compliment the hydrograph metrics i total rainfall mm and ii maximum rainfall intensity over a 10 min interval mm h 1 3 3 hydrograph data quality control data for a total of 506 hydrographs were extracted 152 storms for catchment f 187 for o and 167 for n runoff and rainfall metrics for these storms are summarised in appendix a the full dataset covers a total of 329 storm events however this includes 223 storms where hydrographs fitting the strict selection criteria could only be extracted for a single site there were 68 storm events where hydrographs could be extracted for all three catchments as storm flow characteristics are influenced by antecedent conditions and the nature of rainfall events evans et al 1999 the mismatch in storm events in the complete data set could lead to substantial bias when comparing metrics between catchments by analysing the 204 hydrographs derived from the 68 storms events for which metrics could be extracted for all three catchments runoff behaviour resulting from similar rainfall and antecedent conditions could be compared directly this reduced dataset allows for a strict and robust comparison of the data and is the primary dataset used for all subsequent statistical analysis of hydrograph metrics there was still considerable noise in the reduced dataset due to the range of rainfall behaviours and antecedent conditions total rainfall per event ranges from 4 to 56 mm and maximum event rainfall intensity ranges from 1 8 to 54 mm h 1 leading to a wide range of runoff responses in the storm flow metrics by standardising the metrics derived at the treatment catchments against the control catchment we can differentiate responses due to restoration treatment from natural variation this was achieved by deriving the relative difference treatment minus control between the metrics produced by control and treatment sites 3 3 1 high magnitude events to assess the potential utility of peatland restoration as an nfm measure in upland catchments it is important to assess the degree to which changes in runoff delivery are maintained in high magnitude events in particular if hillslope and channel storage control runoff then nfm efficacy may be reduced in large storms since storage as a proportion of storm runoff would be minimised data from the ten biggest pre restoration and ten biggest post restoration storms total event precipitation were compared analysis of the large storm subset was based on standardised metrics from the two treatment sites relative to the control 3 4 statistical analyses many of the variables of interest do not follow a normal distribution overland flow rainfall hydrograph metrics so non parametric tests of difference were employed to determine the statistical significance of the influence of restoration where data were available for each year of the study kruskal wallis 1 way anova were used to investigate year on year changes following restoration pairwise comparisons were applied post hoc using adjusted mann whitney u tests to assess where any significant differences lie where only one year of post restoration data was available water table overland flow or the data set had been reduced to before and after data mann whitney u tests were used to investigate the effects of restoration all relationships were tested at the 95 level p 0 05 in using non parametric analyses we were unable to assess the additional benefit of gully blocking statistically as there is no non parametric equivalent of a 2 way anova which would allow us to examine the effect of two factors before after restoration and treatment type in an unbalanced dataset any impacts of gully blocking are discussed in terms of additional magnitude of change relative to re vegetation alone 4 results figures show the relative difference between the treatment and control sites treatment minus control before and following restoration positive values on the y axis therefore indicate that the metric of interest is greater at the treatment site than at the bare control while negative values indicate the opposite all parameters are discussed in terms of their median value 4 1 impacts of peatland re vegetation on water tables and overland flow in 2010 prior to restoration water tables were closer to the surface at the treatment site than at the control site dtwt were 307 and 345 mm respectively table 2 the relative difference in dtwt dtwtrel was 27 mm fig 2 a in 2014 dtwt at the control site was 342 mm comparable to the 2010 value while dtwt at the treatment site was 293 mm shallower than dtwt observed pre restoration dtwtrel had increased to 59 mm this represents a significant relative decrease in dtwt of 35 mm i e 9 relative to the control at the treatment site following re vegetation p 0 010 mann whitney u in 2010 both the treatment and control sites produced comparable amounts of overland flow median ofq of 0 19 and 0 22 respectively table 2 the relative difference in ofq ofqrel was highly variable around zero fig 2b median ofqrel was negative 0 07 demonstrating that prior to restoration the treatment site was less productive of overland flow than the control in 2014 the relationship was reversed with a positive median ofqrel value of 0 11 although this increase in overland flow at the treatment site is not statistically significant p 0 065 mann whitney u there has been a clear shift in behaviour after treatment ofqrel on all bar one measurement day was positive indicating that the re vegetated site was producing consistently more overland flow than the control 4 2 impacts of peatland re vegetation and gully blocking on hydrograph behaviour 4 2 1 annual data descriptive statistics for the four key hydrograph metrics at the three micro catchments are summarised in table 3 and the relative differences between the treatment and control sites treatment minus control are presented in fig 3 these relative differences are referred to as lagrel peakqrel hsirel and c rel groupings of statistically similar years based on kruskal wallis 1 way anova are represented by lower case letters the data suggest that restoration has had an immediate effect on three out of the four metrics at both treatment sites lagrel increased and both peakqrel and hsirel were reduced immediately after restoration there was no consistent change in c rel with post restoration values similar to pre restoration values in two of the three post treatment years following the pronounced step change in lagrel peakqrel and hsirel in 2012 there are no subsequent directional trends apparent in any of the metrics lagrel shows the clearest evidence of a consistent step change in behaviour following restoration at both treatment sites lagrel in 2010 11 i e before restoration fall into group a while all subsequent years fall into group b fig 3a and b lagrel pre restoration was therefore significantly different to lagrel post restoration and lagrel was statistically similar in the three years following restoration similar groupings can be seen for hsirel fig 3e and f a step change is apparent but less pronounced for peakqrel with the two treatment sites producing different groupings at the re vegetated site o the two years following treatment are distinct from the pre restoration period group b but 2014 produced similar peakqrel to the pre restoration period group a fig 3c at the re vegetated and blocked site n the three years post treatment are similar group b but the year immediately after restoration 2012 can also be grouped with the pre restoration period group a fig 3d the high post restoration peakqrel in 2014 coincides with anomalously high relative crel values at the same site fig 3g indicating that variation in peakqrel is non random the simplest explanation of the trends observed in the data is a step change in lagrel peakqrel and hsirel in response to restoration subsequent variability is interpreted as inter annual noise resulting from variation across the storms available for analysis based on this interpretation we combine the three years of post restoration data into a single after restoration dataset to determine the average magnitude of the changes in hydrograph behaviour following restoration 4 2 2 baci analysis prior to treatment hydrographs at the three sites behaved in a similar manner table 4 lag ranged between 15 and 30 min peakq was between 490 and 750 l s 1 km 2 hsi ranged between 0 16 and 0 20 and c was between 40 and 48 there were no significant differences in hydrograph metrics at the three sites before treatment kruskal wallis 1 way anova p 0 05 for all parameters however it should be noted that sites f and o were consistently at opposite ends of these ranges with site o displaying flashier flow characteristics shorter lag times higher peakq consistent with its smaller catchment area table 1 before restoration lagrel at site o re vegetation only was 10 min fig 4 a lag was 61 of that at the control site following restoration lagrel increased to 10 min and lag was on average 167 of the control this represents a statistically significant increase in lagrel of 20 min or a 106 increase in lag relative to the control p 0 001 mann whitney u at site n re vegetation with additional gully blocks prior to restoration lagrel was 0 i e lag was on average the same length as at the control site following restoration lagrel increased to 30 min and lag was on average 300 of the control this represents a statistically significant increase in lagrel of 30 min or a 200 increase in lag relative to the control p 0 001 mann whitney u prior to restoration peakqrel at site o was 131 l s 1 km 2 fig 4b peakq was 129 that of the control site following restoration peakqrel decreased to 12 l s 1 km 2 indicating that peak discharges were roughly the same as the control this represents a statistically significant decrease in peakqrel of 143 l s 1 km 2 or a 27 decrease in peakq relative to the control p 0 001 mann whitney u at site n in the pre restoration period peakqrel was 55 l s 1 km 2 peakq was similar to the control site 108 following restoration peakqrel decreased to 200 l s 1 km 2 and peakq was only 57 of the control this represents a statistically significant 255 l s 1 km 2 decrease in peakqrel or a 51 decrease in peakq relative to the control p 0 001 mann whitney u during the pre restoration period hsirel at site o was 0 024 fig 4c hsi was 117 of the control site following restoration hsirel decreased to 0 038 so hsi was 80 of the control this represents a statistically significant decrease in hsirel of 0 062 or a 37 decrease in hsi relative to the control p 0 001 mann whitney u following restoration at site n hsirel was 0 005 i e hsi was similar to the control site 107 following restoration hsirel decreased to 0 059 and hsi was 69 of the control this represents a statistically significant decrease in hsirel of 0 064 or a 38 decrease in hsi relative to the control p 0 001 mann whitney u there was no change in c rel at either site following restoration pn 0 676 and po 0 888 mann whitney u before intervention the c rel at site o was 4 5 indicating that it was more productive of runoff than the control following restoration c rel increased slightly to 7 2 c rel at site n was 0 36 prior to restoration indicating that runoff production was similar to the control site following restoration c rel fell slightly to 2 3 this represents shifts in c rel of 2 7 and 2 6 at sites o and n respectively however it is clear from the graph in fig 4d that post restoration c rel at both sites is well within the range of pre restoration values so it is unsurprising that this variation is not statistically significant installing gully blocks in addition to re vegetation as part of the restoration treatment increased lagrel by a further 10 min i e lag increased by an extra 94 relative to the control and decreased peakqrel by an additional 112 l s 1 km 2 i e peakq decreased by a further 24 relative to the control however the gully blocks did not have any additional effect on the magnitude of change in hsirel which decreased by 37 and 38 at the treatment sites following restoration 4 2 3 high magnitude storms the magnitude of the effects of restoration practices were also investigated for the largest storms in the dataset summarised in table 5 to test if the effects of the intervention were still evident under more extreme rainfall conditions storm magnitudes ranged between 11 and 36 mm total precipitation before restoration and 15 and 56 mm after intervention appendix b the relative differences between the treatment and control sites treatment minus control for each metric are shown in fig 5 all parameters discussed in this section are median values as in the main dataset there was a statistically significant increase in lagrel at both of the treatment sites during high magnitude storms fig 5a po 0 019 and pn 0 035 mann whitney u while the scale of change at site o was similar to that of the full dataset the magnitude of change at site n was considerably less than when considering all storms for large storms lagrel at site o increased by 25 min 109 increase in lag similar to the main dataset where lagrel increased by 20 min 106 increase in lag however at site n lagrel only increased by 10 min during large storms representing a 25 increase in lag much less than the 200 increase in lag in the full dataset there was also a statistically significant decrease in peakqrel at both treatment sites during large storms fig 5b po 0 019 and pn 0 035 mann whitney u the magnitude of change in peakq at site o was smaller than that of the full dataset 17 versus 27 while at site n it was similar to the main dataset 56 versus 57 hsirel was also reduced for large storms fig 5c by 28 at site o and 26 at site n this was less than when considering all storms 37 and 38 and this shift in hydrograph shape post restoration was not statistically significant po 0 075 and pn 0 143 mann whitney u unlike the full data set crel was reduced at both treatment sites during large storms following restoration fig 5d but these reductions were not statistically significant po 0 971 and pn 0 123 mann whitney u 5 discussion 5 1 the impact of restoration on runoff generation restoration has had a pronounced effect on the hydrology of the peatland headwater catchments producing marked changes in water table depth runoff production and storm flow behaviour restoration by re vegetation raised water tables by 35 mm after three years re wetting the treated areas which in turn increased the incidence of overland flow relative to un treated sites re vegetation has also had an immediate and significant impact on storm hydrograph characteristics increasing lag times by 106 and decreasing peak storm discharge by 27 and hsi by 37 gully blocking enhances the benefits of re vegetation with lag times increased by a further 94 and peak storm discharge reduced by an additional 24 relative to the control however gully blocking does not appear to alter the flashiness of stormflow as hsi was reduced by a similar proportion at both of the treatment sites neither of the treatments have had any impact on the proportion of storm event rainfall that becomes storm discharge c the changes to hydrograph behaviour post restoration are still evident during large storms fig 5 albeit to a lesser extent for some parameters indicating that the changes in runoff delivery are maintained in high magnitude events the observed hydrological impacts of restoration in peatland headwaters therefore have the potential to alter downstream stormflow behaviour and reduce flood risk we acknowledge that our results are based on a limited number of sites and that replicating our experiments at different locations would strengthen our findings however our data corresponds with findings from observational and modelling studies providing confidence that our results are more generally valid for example grayson et al 2010 observed c 20 reductions in peak discharge due to natural revegetation in a blanket peatland in the north pennines gao et al 2016 modelled the impacts of vegetation cover on riparian strips on peatland stormflow in blanket peatlands in england and wales using comparable rainfall intensities to those observed in our study and found that bare riparian zones increased peak flow by up to 20 while sphagnum covered ground reduced peak flow by up to 13 similarly pan and shangguan 2006 observed 14 25 reductions in runoff by adding grass to bare soil in a plot study of loessial loam in yangling china 5 2 process controls what might be causing these changes in runoff generation 5 2 1 water tables and overland flow re vegetation has raised water table depth and increased incidence of overland flow over a relatively short period c 3 years but not yet to levels comparable with intact peatlands c f evans et al 1999 holden et al 2006 water table recovery has been widely documented in peatlands where artificial drains have been blocked e g shantz and price 2006 wilson et al 2010 haapalehto et al 2011 holden et al 2011 menberu et al 2016 however the present study provides the first example of re vegetation alone improving water table condition in blanket peatlands water table rises under re vegetation could be driven by a range of potential mechanisms the insulating properties of newly established vegetation cover may reduce evaporative losses cf grayson et al 2010 price et al 1998 found that net radiation and soil heat flux were greater over bare peat when compared to mulched surfaces attributing this to the mulch s higher albedo so the change from dark bare peat to higher albedo re vegetated surfaces is likely having a similar effect alternatively root penetration may increase infiltration or vegetation may increase microtopographic storage there may also have been structural changes in the peat matrix over time reducing hydrophobicity and increasing the peat s ability to retain water investigations of the peat matrix combined with analyses of net radiation and evapotranspiration data are needed to distinguish between these hypotheses incidences of overland flow increased following re vegetation holden and burt 2003 show that saturation excess overland flow is the dominated runoff mechanism in an intact peatland in the northern pennines and work by evans et al 1999 suggests that this is linked to the reactive nature of peatland water tables to precipitation increased overland flow is therefore consistent with the declines in depth to water table discussed above however re vegetation has not restored runoff conditions to those of the intact site reported in holden and burt 2003 suggesting that incomplete water table recovery constrained by the fact that topography is not returned to pre erosion form by the restoration holden et al 2006 limits runoff recovery despite the observed increase in overland flow and apparent reduced storage capacity due to rising water tables percentage runoff values have not changed following restoration indicating that there is no significant change in catchment storage during storm events peatlands characteristically have low specific yields price 1996 so that the change in storage associated with small changes in water table in this instance appears to be within measurement noise 5 2 2 hydrograph response the runoff coefficient shows no change following re vegetation implying that hillslope storage is not altered despite there being no change in long term storage the rate of delivery of runoff has been reduced as illustrated by increased lag times and attenuated hydrograph shapes grayson et al 2010 observed similar changes in hydrograph behaviour at a naturally revegetated peatland site in the north pennines this is likely due to increased surface roughness provided by the newly established vegetation cf holden et al 2008 pan and shangguan 2006 gully blocking enhances the impacts of re vegetation on peak discharge and lag time but there was no significant change in runoff coefficient in the blocked catchment indicating that there has been no gain in storage through ponding behind gully blocks cf evans et al 2005 this is perhaps surprising but indicates that the additional changes in stormflow hydrographs associated with the gully blocking in this study are driven by the introduction of large scale roughness elements to the channel it should be noted that this does not mean that gully blocking lacks the potential to increase catchment storage the findings presented here are based on a single catchment with a particular arrangement of blocks and the optimal approaches to block design and spacing are yet to be determined adjusting the number of blocks and their spacing and design has the potential to further attenuate stormflow and increase catchment storage milledge et al 2015 the trajectory of hydrograph response in gullied systems will also require evaluation given the relatively short time period represented in the current analysis and the potential for longer term effects associated with gully infilling and revegetation comparison with hydrological data emerging from other gully blocked peat systems such as the high elevation peats of the tibetan plateau zhang et al 2012 2016 will be instructive 5 3 wider implications the data we present provide the first controlled catchment scale experimental evidence that hydraulic roughness controlled by vegetation cover drives the rainfall runoff response in blanket peatlands cf grayson et al 2010 the establishment of the nurse crop has had an immediate i e within one growing season impact on stormflow characteristics with no further trends in the subsequent years fig 3 however based on the work of holden et al 2008 it is reasonable to assume that surface roughness and hence the rainfall runoff response will be further modified over longer time scales as the vegetation matures and natural blanket bog species return the fact that the roughness effect dominates runoff as opposed to storage means that it persists in high magnitude storm events fig 5 this is an important finding in terms of nfm especially in headwater catchments where overland flow and flow depths are relatively shallow 5 3 1 restoration and land management these findings have implications beyond simply re vegetating areas of bare peat sphagnum is regarded as a keystone species in peatlands rochefort 2000 gorham and rochefort 2003 due to its role in bog building and maintaining high water tables and acidic conditions and its reintroduction is becoming a priority in blanket peat restoration initiatives in plot experiments holden et al 2008 demonstrated that sphagnum had the greatest impact on slowing overland flow velocities only c 10 that of bare ground so widespread reintroduction has the potential to make a major contribution to nfm especially if strategically targeted in riparian zones gao et al 2016 similarly other land management practices which alter vegetation cover such as the creation of clough woodland grazing anderson and radford 1994 and prescribed burning clay et al 2009 holden et al 2015 may also impact downstream flood risk through surface roughness effects further work is needed to better quantify the effects of different land covers and uses at the catchment scale this study highlights the importance of identifying suitable control sites to underpin the results of short term less than decadal duration catchment studies the use of appropriate control has removed substantial amounts of noise in the data resulting from inter annual variation in synoptic hydrometeorology without the control site we may have incorrectly deduced a storage effect as the raw data showed a reduction in c at the treatment sites post restoration table 4 however this is not the case when c is considered relative to the control fig 4 similarly we observed lower incidence of overland flow in the treatment catchments post restoration table 2 but a substantial increase in overland flow relative to the control catchment fig 2 by assessing deviations from the control we have been able to detect the magnitude of the effect of restoration independent of synoptic conditions the control component of the baci design is therefore critical when assessing the impact of ecosystem restoration to avoid misleading results and to understand the processes driving post intervention change this is especially important when considering the policy relevance of environmental science research bilotta et al 2014 2015 and should be considered an essential element of restoration monitoring 5 3 2 downstream flood risk the significant post restoration changes in hydrology observed in this study will reduce flood risk at the headwater scale these headwater effects will propagate downstream with the potential to reduce flood risk substantially at the wider catchment scale reduction in downstream flood risk will depend on two important scale factors firstly the scale of restoration relative to the size of the catchment milledge et al 2015 and the position of restoration works in the landscape gao et al 2016 secondly the nature of catchment and sub catchment geography and associated hydrograph synchronisation effects contributes to the wider catchment hydrograph pattison et al 2014 metcalfe et al 2018 this is an important consideration for example nutt and perfect 2011 present evidence that a moorland improvement scheme designed to delay runoff in the allen water scotland may have partially synchronised sub catchment peak flows and so increased downstream flood risk conversely similar planned moorland improvement to a different sub catchment were shown to help desynchronise the runoff from this sub catchment and decrease flood risk nutt and perfect 2011 we note that restored blanket peats are located typically at the extreme upper end of drainage and catchment networks so in this context an increase in storm flow travel times from these systems would generally be expected to reduce peak flows downstream the use of monitoring approaches to evaluate these scale effects and to quantify the benefits of restoration on downstream flood risk reduction is problematic this is due to multiple influences on flow regimes in wider catchments and confounding factors making it difficult to isolate the effects of restoration within empirical storm flow datasets dadson et al 2017 it is also extremely difficult to identify suitable control systems at the large catchment scale however the benefits of restoration effects on flood risk reduction at larger catchment scales can be quantified using hydrological models e g lane and milledge 2012 the results of the current study provide the basis for realistic and robust hydrological modelling of downstream flood risk change the study has quantified changes in lag times and peak flows from headwaters associated with restoration and has demonstrated the hydrological processes that underlie these effects these two factors permit appropriate model formulation and calibration e g milledge et al 2015 but further catchment scale studies are required to better inform modelling assessments 6 conclusion this study has adopted a paired catchment approach within a baci design to demonstrate that re vegetation of bare peat and gully blocking reduces rates of hillslope runoff from blanket peatland water tables have become shallower and the incidence of overland flow has increased but this has not significantly affected the volume of storm runoff produced peak discharges are reduced and lag times are increased despite there being no overall change in catchment storage this is consistent with reduced hillslope runoff velocities due to increases in surface roughness provided by the newly established vegetation and gully blocks modifications in peatland vegetation cover and drainage whether deliberate or as a consequence of changing land use and management regimes will have consequences in terms of downstream flood risk the significant magnitude of the changes detailed in this study demonstrates that there is a clear and convincing evidence base to develop the role of peatland restoration techniques within the nfm framework operationalising these findings will require upscaling of the evidence from this study but the empirical data presented here and the finding that runoff delivery rather than storage is key provides a basis for modelling the potential impacts at larger scales until now investment in peatland restoration has been justified by reference to enhanced biodiversity and to the role of peatlands in carbon storage our findings suggest that these large scale modifications of upland landscapes may also play a role in protecting communities from flooding adding to the multiple

8621,water is indispensable for earth resilience and sustainable development the capacity of social ecological systems to deal with shocks adapting to changing conditions and transforming in situations of crisis are fundamentally dependent on the functions of water to e g regulate the earth s climate support biomass production and supply water resources for human societies however massive inter connected human interference involving climate forcing water withdrawal dam constructions and land use change have significantly disturbed these water functions and induced regime shifts in social ecological systems in many cases changes in core water functions have pushed systems beyond tipping points and led to fundamental shifts in system feedback examples of such transgressions where water has played a critical role are collapse of aquatic systems beyond water quality and quantity thresholds desertification due to soil and ecosystem degradation and tropical forest dieback associated with self amplifying moisture and carbon feedbacks here we aggregate the volumes and flows of water involved in water functions globally and review the evidence of freshwater related linear collapse and non linear tipping points in ecological and social systems through the lens of resilience theory based on the literature review we synthesize the role of water in mediating different types of ecosystem regime shifts and generalize the process by which life support systems are at risk of collapsing due to loss of water functions we conclude that water plays a fundamental role in providing social ecological resilience and suggest that further research is needed to understand how the erosion of water resilience at local and regional scale may potentially interact cascade or

introduction humanity has entered a new geological epoch the anthropocene where humans constitute the largest driver of environmental change at the planetary scale crutzen 2002 steffen et al 2015 this includes human pressure on the hydrological cycle which occur across all scales from local watershed and water tables to river basins and regional climate systems there is ample evidence of human induced deterioration of water quantity and quality related to environmental degradation over the past century in particular since the advent of the great acceleration of the modern human

droughts and societal collapse aimers and hodell 2011 a growing evidence base on abrupt changes due to social and environmental interactions and reinforcing feedbacks urges attention to the risk of water induced tipping points in social ecological systems across scales this offers an opportunity to deepen our understanding of how water induced system tipping points and collapse emerge here the application of resilience theory may offer a perspective for understanding the processes and underlying conditions that lead up to unwelcome surprises the overall aim of this paper is to provide a synthesized and conceptual understanding of the processes through which water induced tipping points are crossed and collapse occur in ecological and social ecological systems based on documented

related tipping points in systems discuss their geopolitical and social aspects and discuss the evidence of a number of life support system changes that have shaken societies in the past 2 water resilience theory concepts and definitions 2 1 resilience theory resilience is defined as the ability of a system to cope with disturbance without crossing tipping points into a new stability domain to adapt to change and transform into a new state following a regime shift tipping into a new social ecological equilibrium folke et al 2010 water resilience can be defined as the role of water see section 2 2 in safeguarding and sustaining a particular desired state of a social ecological system ranging from sustaining the state of ecosystems and biomes to the stability of regional weather and climate systems and the ability of the hydrological cycle to maintain stable water supply for societies and ultimately the state of the biosphere and the earth system through moisture feedback climate forcing and regulating biomass growth in terrestrial ecosystems in principle we distinguish between two types of system collapse fig 1 non linear collapse shift crossing of a tipping point resulting in a state change from one semi equilibrium state characterised by one set of negative feedbacks to another characterized by a new set of self reinforcing positive feedbacks that is often impossible or difficult to reverse due to hysteresis effect and linear collapse gradual change of water properties that causes the collapse of a system without any shift from one mix of feedbacks to another and that has limited or no hysteresis effect a typical example of a non linear tipping point is the evidence of the biophysical existence of a state shift between rainforest and savanna fig 1a c strongly related to water resilience as precipitation declines past a certain threshold triggered e g by climate change and deforestation reducing moisture feedback dynamics and raises the dryness of the air due to higher vapor pressure deficit as forest density is reduced the rainforest cannot be sustained and will irreversibly transition into a savanna hirota et al 2011 the transition from a dense to a scarce tree canopy increases evaporation from land reduces the moisture recycling and increases fire risks which are feedbacks fig 1c that help maintain the savanna system staal et al 2015 zemp et al 2017 thus the precipitation threshold required to transition from savanna to rainforest is much higher than the level that lead to a savannization of the forest system this difference in threshold level depending on state shift direction is by definition the hysteresis effect in some circumstances a transition can be irreversible such as in the case of species extinctions linear collapse on the other hand can be exemplified by river depletion fig 1b d which can cause a river to dry up without self amplifying feedbacks since the water level can in principle be restored in a linear fashion however it is important to clearly define the system and water variable considered related social systems such as riverine fishing communities can tip non linearly with hysteresis effect and much better fishing conditions can be required to attract people to resume fishing than was required for the activities to be abandoned central to these two definitions of system state shift are thus the shift or absence of shift in feedbacks in the considered system and the degree of hysteresis while the distinction between non linear tipping dynamics and linear collapse appears clear cut in theory a varying degree of hysteresis in real world systems means that it is not always possible to cleanly categorize all system collapse in this way to further clarify the role and function of water for resilience see sections 2 2 and 2 3 and definitions in table 1 2 2 the three roles of water for system resilience water is inherently intertwined with all processes of a social ecological system and we distinguish between three central roles of water relative to the system of consideration as control state and driving variable fig 2 rockstr√∂m et al 2014 as control variable water is the source of resilience or one of the regulating factors behind the state of a system through the generation of ecosystem services and functions in both terrestrial and aquatic systems being the bloodstream of the biosphere water is key in sustaining all life on earth as state variable water is the victim of change being subject to external changes for example land use change and pollution as driving variable water is the agent of change affecting resilience by changes in spatial and temporal distribution of water flows and stock e g due to hydrological impacts of climate change these three roles of water flow into each other and can exist simultaneously and interact dynamically for example deforestation disturbs the water cycle i e water becomes the victim of change which in turn might lead to disruptive flooding and decrease in moisture feedback i e water becomes the agent of change that fails in delivering water dependent biomass growth and sustain biodiversity beyond those directly affected by the initial deforestation i e water as source of resilience i e a control variable 2 3 water functions in the fresh water system the water cycle involves a broad set of core functions together crucial for biophysical stability and determinants of water resilience falkenmark 2017 rockstr√∂m et al 2014 these functions are active in different segments of the water cycle fig 3 in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the atmosphere and in direct interaction with human society while water functions can overlap with water related ecosystem services the key of the water functions lies in their role to provide resilience and not just benefits we identified three green water functions 1 regulatory which involves the function of air moisture soil moisture water in living matter and evaporation and transpiration flows to regulate the earth s energy balance and climate system at local to global scale through carbon sequestration jackson et al 2005 cloud formation albedo regulation latent heat release and temperature regulator miralles et al 2014 atmospheric boundary layer development convective conditions guillod et al 2015 as well as water vapor s ability to trap heat as a greenhouse gas 2 productive which involves the function of evaporation to sustain food and bioenergy production as well as biomass growth nov√°k and van genuchten 2008 3 moisture feedback which involves the function of recycled evaporation to regulate the water cycle over land salati et al 1979 van der ent et al 2010 and five blue water functions 4 water for supply which involves the function of withdrawn water used for water supply in society wada et al 2014 5 carrier chemical load which involves the function of river flows and base flows to carry nutrients and pollution 6 state which involves the function of lakes wetlands groundwater reservoirs and river water volumes to uphold the aquatic state 7 productive which involves the function of withdrawn water used for irrigation in agriculture to produce food j√§germeyr et al 2016 and lakes wetlands and river water volumes to sustain aquatic biomass growth and 8 regulatory control which involves the function of river flows and base flows to regulate aquatic ecosystems wetlands groundwater glaciers and permafrost volumes regulate the earth s energy balance and climate through albedo regulation and carbon storage groundwater wada et al 2016 and glaciers hirabayashi et al 2010 regulate sea levels and geological processes such as subsidence the various ways the different water stocks and flows serve as water functions are listed in tables 2 and 3 and range from direct link to the water cycle to indirect interaction with the climate system through vegetation such as albedo and carbon cycle regulation while the tables do not to show interactions the water stocks flows functions and processes are massively interlinked and can interact in complex ways for example beyond direct contribution to climate regulation through carbon storage and albedo soil moisture is also a key determinant of evaporation and has an important influence on precipitation patterns and water state in living matter sometimes the feedbacks in different water compartments can be both positive and negative and thus cancel out impacts on certain water functions for example while drying soil may increase reflectance water stress in plants may cause reduced reflection in leaves and increased exposure to soil that undo those effects teuling and seneviratne 2008 due to these complex interactions the attribution of water functions to different stocks and flows in these tables should be seen only as a method to pinpoint key processes in reality all water stocks flows and functions are intimately connected through the eight water functions freshwater flows and stocks are fundamental determinants of the state of ecosystems and biomes in the biosphere and the stability and feedbacks in earth system regulating systems such as the climate system and global cycles of nutrients importantly water is not only a determinant of the ability of social ecological systems to deal with shocks adapting to changing conditions and transforming in situations of crisis i e what defines resilience folke 2006 water is also a primary driver of amplified and more frequent shocks and stresses as a result of human global environmental change in this sense water is both friend and foe in the pursuit of resilience for sustainable development in the anthropocene as evident from the overview in table 2 and 3 water stocks and flows often serve more than one function and are profoundly active in driving the life support system we aggregate water stocks and flows at the global scale from the literature see table s1 to provide an overview of quantity of water involved in the eight different green and blue water functions this exercise fig 4 shows that blue water functions together involve much larger volumes of water groundwater surface water ice than those of green water soil moisture air moisture living matter in terms of flows by contrast the green water function for regulating the earth s energy and climate system involves the largest water flows terrestrial evaporation compared with precipitation over land green water functions involve 1 0 1 7 times as much water flows and blue water 0 6 1 0 times together green and blue water functions involve water flows amounting to 1 6 2 7 times the precipitation flow despite the conservative way of accounting for water functions that ignore indirect and cascading effects thus this neatly highlights the inherently multi functional role of water 3 evidence of water related non linear tipping and linear collapse 3 1 ecological and biophysical collapse literature offers a broad overview of cases where resilience has undergone erosion this section synthesizes examples of water related biophysical regime shifts that have either been observed or suggested by theories or modelling studies around the world table 4 importantly we show how each evidence of regime shift is linked to key water functions as well as the resilience and feedback processes involved this overview shows the diversity of water related tipping points and collapses in terms of human interference spatial scale temporal scale location reversibility and system perturbed it is clear that many of the local and regional scale biophysical resilience erosion processes and mechanisms are well understood by the scientific community the most serious regime shifts related to full scale amazon forest dieback and total glaciers meltdown are well understood through theories and modelling the perhaps most elusive feedbacks are the ones potentially occurring in societies for example while loss in water supply to societies can in principle be considered a linear process in the biophysical system i e water supply can be re instated as soon as water is available potential thresholds in the society towards e g upheaval migration and financial collapse are complex and context specific and have generally been challenging to attribute to changes in any specific variables social feedback mechanisms can moreover mediate regime shift in an ecological or biophysical system these social feedback are context dependent and not necessarily tied to a specific type of water resilience function perturbation social feedback modifications may operate from individual to global scale and include a wide range of aspects m√ºller hansen et al 2017 wada et al 2017 such as social norms cultural values laws and regulations implementation castilla rho et al 2017 behavioral patterns chen et al 2012 traditions risk levels benchekroun and long 2014 uncertainty de zeeuw and zemel 2012 institutions galaz 2005 technology markets knowledge micklin 1988 and learning pahl wostl 2006 a wealth of studies explore social feedback in resource sharing context to understand the tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 and the conditions required to govern the commons ostrom 1990 commonly these relate to the blue water resilience functions supply carrier state productive and regulatory and the green water resilience function productive at the local to regional scale few studies have yet explored the social dynamics of green water resilience function moisture feedback keys and wang erlandsson 2018 indirect relation to green water resilience function regulatory can be found in studies that address for example global climate barrett 2013 nkuiya 2015 or land management meyfroidt et al 2018 3 2 social collapse the evidence that water has multiple functions tables 2 and 3 regulating the state and the resilience of biophysical systems combined with mounting evidence of water related and induced tipping points as water resilience is lost table 4 raises the major question of what implications loss of water resilience and crossing water tipping points have on societies table 5 illustrates a set of evidences and risks for social tipping points and collapsed civilizations failure has been generated in different ways in most cases triggered by severe drought years all show disastrous effects on management failures that lead to societal problems generated by biophysical collapses 4 water resilience processes in social ecological systems in this section we summarise and interpret the evidences presented in section 3 and discuss the general pattern that emerge state shifts in ecological and biophysical systems related to water often involve more than one water function and role disturbances in water functions might occur simultaneously interact or cascade accordingly the role of water for inducing regime shifts or linear collapse shifts between being a control state and driving variable 4 1 water functions mediate ecosystem tipping and collapse based on table 4 fig 5 illustrates the general way water mediate in ecosystem collapse through its eight functions section 2 3 and three roles section 2 2 at the local to regional scale for example 1 salinization which is primarily induced by irrigation using salinized water blue carrier function driving variable and moisture feedback green moisture feedback function state variable and secondarily by regulation of soil moisture green regulatory control and thirdly by loss in biomass production green productive control 2 savannization which is primarily induced by deforestation and climate change green moisture feedback driving secondly through decrease in biomass production green productive state and thirdly through impact on the climate system through albedo carbon and circulation feedback green regulatory state 3 desertification which is primarily induced by overgrazing green productive control and secondarily through decline in moisture feedback green moisture feedback driving 4 river basin closure which is primarily induced by unsustainable surface water withdrawal blue supply driving ability to support biomass growth blue productive driving and secondarily through moisture feedback as evaporation decreases green moisture feedback control 5 aquifer depletion which is primarily induced by unsustainable groundwater withdrawal blue supply driving decline in water volumes blue state state ability to support biomass growth blue productive driving and secondarily through moisture feedback as evaporation decreases green moisture feedback control 6 water logging which is primarily induced by water being accumulated in the soil blue state state and which has secondary effects on the biomass production green productive control although irrigation or groundwater caused water logging could be considered as affecting the blue productive function 7 eutrophication which is primarily induced by nutrient overload from agricultural fertilization blue carrier driving secondarily by shift in type of ecological biomass supported by the ecosystem blue productive state 8 aquatic system collapse which is primarily induced by dams and reservoirs that disrupt flow variation blue regulatory driving secondarily by demand in water for societal supply blue supply state biomass production blue productive state and change in water volumes blue state control fig 5 is a conceptualization of key processes useful for system understanding in generalized cases and specific cases might have more diverse causes and interactions a benefit of breaking down the roles and functions of water is how clearly it shows that water issues have profound implications and can be critically impacted by systems and sectors well beyond the traditional notion of a water sector that directly deals with visible liquid water in addition many climate land surface and hydrological models struggle to adequately reflect observed ecosystem regime shifts and may benefit from a systematic understanding of how water function disturbance and feedbacks may or may not be well represented in the model finally system understanding of the biophysical and ecological processes is fundamental for understanding the often much more elusive complex and context specific feedbacks in societal systems as we will discuss in the next section 4 2 life support systems changes can shake societies a rich archive of historic evidence shows how water scarcity and deterioration of water quality has contributed to the decline of ancient empires such as the maya the mesopotamian irrigation societies and the antique arab civilization section 3 2 there is rising indicative evidence of how deterioration of fundamental water functions for life support systems such as the collapse of food systems due to prolonged droughts which very likely amplified by anthropogenic global warming has contributed to accelerate and potentially accentuate human conflicts and national instability such as the arab spring and the syrian war gleick 2014 in more general terms land mismanagement may contribute to social system collapse by altering the terrestrial ecosystem to which the population has become used especially vulnerable have been irrigated civilizations in dry climate regions where the agriculture has included unsustainable components contributing causes of agricultural civilization s collapses include salinization water logging choking canals soil fertility decline etc the processes may be slow with progressive increase in salinization or water logging for which there is no remedy in sight societal problems may build up step by step as illustrated by the arab spring but finally have grown in size and complexity to a level impossible to compensate by countermeasures social collapse is thus a result of multiple interacting processes ranging across geopolitics economics values weak states and environmental shifts in simple terms when deterioration of natural economic and human capital manifests itself in collapse in human security rule of law and ultimately conflict at first resilience is eroded in the social economic system hydrological system and other biophysical systems through anthropogenic or natural disturbance of slow underlying variables as resilience is eroded it becomes more likely for a shock to manifest that potentially triggers a non linear regime shift or linear collapse in the biosphere and the society we attempt to illustrate this general social collapse process in fig 6 a in a more tangible example we interpret the syrian crisis through the resilience lens in fig 6b in the slow undercurrents of the societal land and climate system it is clear that resilience was low due to political instability land degradation and climate change that affected the local hydrological regime as drought triggered crop failure in the low resilient system people abandoned their rural land and migrated to cities where political tensions and instability reached new highs and contributed to the break out of the civil war clearly the societal collapse illustrated in these examples involve feedback with the ecological and biophysical systems in which the societies fundamentally are embedded and rely on this shows both a risk and an opportunity for management and governance of natural systems a resilient biophysical system reduces the risks for the society to cross the threshold towards collapse and a non resilient natural system can influence and in worst case trigger avoidable societal failures while the ancient case studies of societal collapse are limited to the regional scale regional agricultural collapse or failure in our modern era are compensated by for instance food import which may delay realization of resilience problems but potentially also risk larger scale of collapse if resilience erosion affects e g an entire trade network emerging disciplines of hydro sociology and socio hydrology are evidence of the recognised need to study coupled co evolving human water systems sivapalan et al 2012 further consideration of social resilience or hydrological resilience alone is distinctly different from consideration of their resilience of a coupled socio hydrological system mao et al 2017 4 3 building water resilience in the anthropocene in anthropocene the role of water for human development and sustainability has expanded in scope scale and speed placing water resilience at the core of integrated water resource management scope water resilience is no longer just about water they link to climate change dietary choice trade consumption and more when in the past water management effectively meant blue water management water managers of today need to consider vastly cross sectoral implications and green blue water interactions scale water issues have gone global in the past water were studied at the catchment scale lake scale or community scale but global scale drivers of climate and land use change is effectively mediating with the water cycle by melting glaciers changing rainfall patterns increasing drought risks rising sea levels etc water solutions now also need to be sought at the global scale and inter connectivity between scales need to be at the forefront speed changes in the water cycle and changes in the society are rapid and surprising competing with the hard and soft infrastructure development pace and societal learning and response rate and requiring societies to think plan and adapt proactively building water resilience in the anthropocene necessitates a paradigm shift from traditional blue water focused management to adaptive water management pahl wostl 2007 that takes into account interactions between green and blue water and the full water cycle relying on empirically derived resilience building principles maintain diversity manage connectivity manage slow variables and feedbacks foster complex adaptive systems thinking encourage learning broaden participation and promote polycentric governance biggs et al 2015 new tools to build resilience have emerged including resilience assessment and resilience planning sellberg et al 2018 that need to be further developed and employed in various contexts the water resilience functions identified in this paper have the further potential to be explored in terms of their usefulness for management and policy beyond the water sector 5 conclusions and future outlook water is behind all ecological goods and services from the biosphere that make human life on earth possible water is not only a generator of ecosystem services like food and energy it is also a critical agent of change e g functioning as a greenhouse gas and a regulator of temperature on earth and a victim of change e g through shocks like droughts and floods caused by global warming in this paper we put a further emphasis on the role of water as the bloodstream of the biosphere and thus key in sustaining all life on earth by integrating all different functions of water into one integrated framework namely water resilience water resilience defines the role of water in regulating the state of ecosystems biomes and the earth system through interactions and feedbacks of water related ecological functions in this paper we provide comprehensive evidence that water is associated with state shifts in social ecological systems as water functions cross critical tipping points pointing at the importance of understanding the role of water as a source of resilience its functioning is essential for earth system resilience and sustainable development we distinguish between eight parallel water functions and show the massive scale of the water flows and stocks by which they contribute to the functioning of components of the earth system green water related flows and stocks uphold three of these systems the energy and climate system biomass production and moisture feedback and hydrological recirculation and blue water flows and stocks uphold five systems related to societal water supply the nutrient and pollution transport the aquatic state of blue freshwater bodies and resources and the regulation of aquatic ecosystems and climate we clarify the profound role played by water flows as a function multiplier water flows corresponding up to 170 of the annual flow of terrestrial precipitation contribute to green water functions 100 means the same precipitation contribute to several functions and up to 100 to blue water functions all freshwater stocks serve fundamental functions for regulating the earth s climate and aquatic ecosystems human interference with green and blue water functions is considerable and examples of hydrologically coupled ecological system tipping points associated with non linear change are ample in literature a broad overview of cases provide evidence of erosion of water resilience in biophysical water related systems with tipping points in most cases multiple water functions are active in the loss of water resilience salinization savannization deforestation desertification river basin closure aquifer depletion water logging eutrophication aquatic system collapse the cases include several regional scale ecological systems and biomes savannas aquatic ecosystems amazon rainforest indian monsoon and the sahara desert water functions are linked also to societal collapse as evident in historical as well as modern time cases we provide mounting evidence of risks of crossing social tipping points as water related resilience is lost resulting in collapse of civilization degraded human security loss of rules of law and amplified conflicts most of these cases were triggered by severe drought events salinization water logging choking canals and soil fertility decline hitting agricultural civilizations land and water mismanagement alter the function and state of terrestrial ecosystems slowly or step by step until no remedy is in view the identified cases exemplify erosion of water resilience both through gradual system decline antique arab civilization and regime shifts maya civilization us dust bowl aral sea region arab spring syrian conflict regime shifts in the past have occurred at the local to regional scale but with the dawn of the anthropocene we now need to consider the risk of human induced regime shifts at the planetary scale rockstr√∂m et al 2009 steffen et al 2018 2015 in future research it will be important to better understand how loss of water resilience at the local scale may influence earth system resilience as a whole through for example cumulative integrative and cascading processes the most visible manifestation of climate change is displayed through the hydrological lens in the form of e g floods droughts and sea level rise that may trigger an understudied interplay of ecological biophysical and social feedbacks at the same time uncertainty prevails in climate model predictions of earth s future climate associated e g with clouds the water in the sky and the dynamics of biosphere carbon feedbacks related directly to water resilience thus the role of water for future earth system resilience will be essential to clarify human interference in all water functions green as well as blue is modifying life support systems on earth how will further global stresses caused by for instance ongoing climate change global population growth and increasing human demands continue to disturb the earth s life support system with its profound interactions between water flows functions and roles on the one hand and on the other essential ecological processes such as food production timber production and biodiversity and what risks will this involve in view of the strong driving forces in the anthropocene the complex interactions with social economic phenomena need special attention modern time teleconnections such as trade and migration can put some relief to water induced social stress and impacts of displacement however this may also temporarily mask resilience loss at the global scale finally the new understanding of water s critical roles for building resilience of the earth s life support system will lead to new types of questions what management related navigation options for the life support systems on earth will there exist to safeguard human wellbeing along realistic pathways that can keep the planet in the present favorable holocene like state with its relatively stable climate what transformations will be critical what shifts in governance approaches in terms of scopes scales and speed will be essential and how can they be achieved we challenge the scientific community to integrate water resilience thinking when exploring these grand challenges for humanity s future on earth funding this

8621,water is indispensable for earth resilience and sustainable development the capacity of social ecological systems to deal with shocks adapting to changing conditions and transforming in situations of crisis are fundamentally dependent on the functions of water to e g regulate the earth s climate support biomass production and supply water resources for human societies however massive inter connected human interference involving climate forcing water withdrawal dam constructions and land use change have significantly disturbed these water functions and induced regime shifts in social ecological systems in many cases changes in core water functions have pushed systems beyond tipping points and led to fundamental shifts in system feedback examples of such transgressions where water has played a critical role are collapse of aquatic systems beyond water quality and quantity thresholds desertification due to soil and ecosystem degradation and tropical forest dieback associated with self amplifying moisture and carbon feedbacks here we aggregate the volumes and flows of water involved in water functions globally and review the evidence of freshwater related linear collapse and non linear tipping points in ecological and social systems through the lens of resilience theory based on the literature review we synthesize the role of water in mediating different types of ecosystem regime shifts and generalize the process by which life support systems are at risk of collapsing due to loss of water functions we conclude that water plays a fundamental role in providing social ecological resilience and suggest that further research is needed to understand how the erosion of water resilience at local and regional scale may potentially interact cascade or amplify through the complex globally hyper connected networks of the anthropocene keywords water sustainability green blue water earth resilience global water system regime shift water conflict 1 introduction humanity has entered a new geological epoch the anthropocene where humans constitute the largest driver of environmental change at the planetary scale crutzen 2002 steffen et al 2015 this includes human pressure on the hydrological cycle which occur across all scales from local watershed and water tables to river basins and regional climate systems there is ample evidence of human induced deterioration of water quantity and quality related to environmental degradation over the past century in particular since the advent of the great acceleration of the modern human industrialized societies in the mid 1950s kummu et al 2016 wada et al 2011 future water prospects are uncertain with four million people facing severe water scarcity at one month per year already today mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 and water related risks listed among the top five global impact risks by the world economic forum for the past consecutive seven years world economic forum 2018 with climate change and intensifying human activities scientific interest in freshwater functions has broadened in view of their roles not only for economic and social development but for sustaining the earth s life support system itself rockstr√∂m et al 2012 particularly there is mounting evidence that rising human pressures on the earth system trigger shifts in interactions between environmental processes and systems e g the hydrological cycle and its interactions with the biosphere feedbacks and potentially triggering tipping points gordon et al 2008 rockstr√∂m et al 2014 at the local to regional scale social ecological systems crossing water induced tipping points include e g aquatic ecosystem collapse desertification and savannization see sect 2 at the planetary scale earth resilience defines the capacity of biophysical processes and systems on earth to sustain feedbacks and interactions that enable the earth system to remain in its current inter glacial state vital for earth resilience are key biophysical tipping elements in the earth system e g botero et al 2014 lenton et al 2008 lenton and williams 2013 reyer et al 2015 among others the amazon rainforest the indian monsoon and the sahara which are all crucially dependent on the water cycle system tipping points may however not only occur in the ecological and biophysical realm but also in the societal realm for example in the recent past water wars have been heatedly debated gleick 1993 however while most recent research appears to agree that direct conflicts and wars are not fought over shared water resources in rivers and lakes allan 1997 brochmann and gleditsch 2012 the debate is still ongoing on the links between e g water scarcity agriculture failure and migration miletto et al 2017 and droughts and societal collapse aimers and hodell 2011 a growing evidence base on abrupt changes due to social and environmental interactions and reinforcing feedbacks urges attention to the risk of water induced tipping points in social ecological systems across scales this offers an opportunity to deepen our understanding of how water induced system tipping points and collapse emerge here the application of resilience theory may offer a perspective for understanding the processes and underlying conditions that lead up to unwelcome surprises the overall aim of this paper is to provide a synthesized and conceptual understanding of the processes through which water induced tipping points are crossed and collapse occur in ecological and social ecological systems based on documented evidence and through the lens of water resilience including fundamental water functions and roles falkenmark 2017 rockstr√∂m et al 2014 specifically we present evidence of a set of biophysical water related tipping points in systems discuss their geopolitical and social aspects and discuss the evidence of a number of life support system changes that have shaken societies in the past 2 water resilience theory concepts and definitions 2 1 resilience theory resilience is defined as the ability of a system to cope with disturbance without crossing tipping points into a new stability domain to adapt to change and transform into a new state following a regime shift tipping into a new social ecological equilibrium folke et al 2010 water resilience can be defined as the role of water see section 2 2 in safeguarding and sustaining a particular desired state of a social ecological system ranging from sustaining the state of ecosystems and biomes to the stability of regional weather and climate systems and the ability of the hydrological cycle to maintain stable water supply for societies and ultimately the state of the biosphere and the earth system through moisture feedback climate forcing and regulating biomass growth in terrestrial ecosystems in principle we distinguish between two types of system collapse fig 1 non linear collapse shift crossing of a tipping point resulting in a state change from one semi equilibrium state characterised by one set of negative feedbacks to another characterized by a new set of self reinforcing positive feedbacks that is often impossible or difficult to reverse due to hysteresis effect and linear collapse gradual change of water properties that causes the collapse of a system without any shift from one mix of feedbacks to another and that has limited or no hysteresis effect a typical example of a non linear tipping point is the evidence of the biophysical existence of a state shift between rainforest and savanna fig 1a c strongly related to water resilience as precipitation declines past a certain threshold triggered e g by climate change and deforestation reducing moisture feedback dynamics and raises the dryness of the air due to higher vapor pressure deficit as forest density is reduced the rainforest cannot be sustained and will irreversibly transition into a savanna hirota et al 2011 the transition from a dense to a scarce tree canopy increases evaporation from land reduces the moisture recycling and increases fire risks which are feedbacks fig 1c that help maintain the savanna system staal et al 2015 zemp et al 2017 thus the precipitation threshold required to transition from savanna to rainforest is much higher than the level that lead to a savannization of the forest system this difference in threshold level depending on state shift direction is by definition the hysteresis effect in some circumstances a transition can be irreversible such as in the case of species extinctions linear collapse on the other hand can be exemplified by river depletion fig 1b d which can cause a river to dry up without self amplifying feedbacks since the water level can in principle be restored in a linear fashion however it is important to clearly define the system and water variable considered related social systems such as riverine fishing communities can tip non linearly with hysteresis effect and much better fishing conditions can be required to attract people to resume fishing than was required for the activities to be abandoned central to these two definitions of system state shift are thus the shift or absence of shift in feedbacks in the considered system and the degree of hysteresis while the distinction between non linear tipping dynamics and linear collapse appears clear cut in theory a varying degree of hysteresis in real world systems means that it is not always possible to cleanly categorize all system collapse in this way to further clarify the role and function of water for resilience see sections 2 2 and 2 3 and definitions in table 1 2 2 the three roles of water for system resilience water is inherently intertwined with all processes of a social ecological system and we distinguish between three central roles of water relative to the system of consideration as control state and driving variable fig 2 rockstr√∂m et al 2014 as control variable water is the source of resilience or one of the regulating factors behind the state of a system through the generation of ecosystem services and functions in both terrestrial and aquatic systems being the bloodstream of the biosphere water is key in sustaining all life on earth as state variable water is the victim of change being subject to external changes for example land use change and pollution as driving variable water is the agent of change affecting resilience by changes in spatial and temporal distribution of water flows and stock e g due to hydrological impacts of climate change these three roles of water flow into each other and can exist simultaneously and interact dynamically for example deforestation disturbs the water cycle i e water becomes the victim of change which in turn might lead to disruptive flooding and decrease in moisture feedback i e water becomes the agent of change that fails in delivering water dependent biomass growth and sustain biodiversity beyond those directly affected by the initial deforestation i e water as source of resilience i e a control variable 2 3 water functions in the fresh water system the water cycle involves a broad set of core functions together crucial for biophysical stability and determinants of water resilience falkenmark 2017 rockstr√∂m et al 2014 these functions are active in different segments of the water cycle fig 3 in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the atmosphere and in direct interaction with human society while water functions can overlap with water related ecosystem services the key of the water functions lies in their role to provide resilience and not just benefits we identified three green water functions 1 regulatory which involves the function of air moisture soil moisture water in living matter and evaporation and transpiration flows to regulate the earth s energy balance and climate system at local to global scale through carbon sequestration jackson et al 2005 cloud formation albedo regulation latent heat release and temperature regulator miralles et al 2014 atmospheric boundary layer development convective conditions guillod et al 2015 as well as water vapor s ability to trap heat as a greenhouse gas 2 productive which involves the function of evaporation to sustain food and bioenergy production as well as biomass growth nov√°k and van genuchten 2008 3 moisture feedback which involves the function of recycled evaporation to regulate the water cycle over land salati et al 1979 van der ent et al 2010 and five blue water functions 4 water for supply which involves the function of withdrawn water used for water supply in society wada et al 2014 5 carrier chemical load which involves the function of river flows and base flows to carry nutrients and pollution 6 state which involves the function of lakes wetlands groundwater reservoirs and river water volumes to uphold the aquatic state 7 productive which involves the function of withdrawn water used for irrigation in agriculture to produce food j√§germeyr et al 2016 and lakes wetlands and river water volumes to sustain aquatic biomass growth and 8 regulatory control which involves the function of river flows and base flows to regulate aquatic ecosystems wetlands groundwater glaciers and permafrost volumes regulate the earth s energy balance and climate through albedo regulation and carbon storage groundwater wada et al 2016 and glaciers hirabayashi et al 2010 regulate sea levels and geological processes such as subsidence the various ways the different water stocks and flows serve as water functions are listed in tables 2 and 3 and range from direct link to the water cycle to indirect interaction with the climate system through vegetation such as albedo and carbon cycle regulation while the tables do not to show interactions the water stocks flows functions and processes are massively interlinked and can interact in complex ways for example beyond direct contribution to climate regulation through carbon storage and albedo soil moisture is also a key determinant of evaporation and has an important influence on precipitation patterns and water state in living matter sometimes the feedbacks in different water compartments can be both positive and negative and thus cancel out impacts on certain water functions for example while drying soil may increase reflectance water stress in plants may cause reduced reflection in leaves and increased exposure to soil that undo those effects teuling and seneviratne 2008 due to these complex interactions the attribution of water functions to different stocks and flows in these tables should be seen only as a method to pinpoint key processes in reality all water stocks flows and functions are intimately connected through the eight water functions freshwater flows and stocks are fundamental determinants of the state of ecosystems and biomes in the biosphere and the stability and feedbacks in earth system regulating systems such as the climate system and global cycles of nutrients importantly water is not only a determinant of the ability of social ecological systems to deal with shocks adapting to changing conditions and transforming in situations of crisis i e what defines resilience folke 2006 water is also a primary driver of amplified and more frequent shocks and stresses as a result of human global environmental change in this sense water is both friend and foe in the pursuit of resilience for sustainable development in the anthropocene as evident from the overview in table 2 and 3 water stocks and flows often serve more than one function and are profoundly active in driving the life support system we aggregate water stocks and flows at the global scale from the literature see table s1 to provide an overview of quantity of water involved in the eight different green and blue water functions this exercise fig 4 shows that blue water functions together involve much larger volumes of water groundwater surface water ice than those of green water soil moisture air moisture living matter in terms of flows by contrast the green water function for regulating the earth s energy and climate system involves the largest water flows terrestrial evaporation compared with precipitation over land green water functions involve 1 0 1 7 times as much water flows and blue water 0 6 1 0 times together green and blue water functions involve water flows amounting to 1 6 2 7 times the precipitation flow despite the conservative way of accounting for water functions that ignore indirect and cascading effects thus this neatly highlights the inherently multi functional role of water 3 evidence of water related non linear tipping and linear collapse 3 1 ecological and biophysical collapse literature offers a broad overview of cases where resilience has undergone erosion this section synthesizes examples of water related biophysical regime shifts that have either been observed or suggested by theories or modelling studies around the world table 4 importantly we show how each evidence of regime shift is linked to key water functions as well as the resilience and feedback processes involved this overview shows the diversity of water related tipping points and collapses in terms of human interference spatial scale temporal scale location reversibility and system perturbed it is clear that many of the local and regional scale biophysical resilience erosion processes and mechanisms are well understood by the scientific community the most serious regime shifts related to full scale amazon forest dieback and total glaciers meltdown are well understood through theories and modelling the perhaps most elusive feedbacks are the ones potentially occurring in societies for example while loss in water supply to societies can in principle be considered a linear process in the biophysical system i e water supply can be re instated as soon as water is available potential thresholds in the society towards e g upheaval migration and financial collapse are complex and context specific and have generally been challenging to attribute to changes in any specific variables social feedback mechanisms can moreover mediate regime shift in an ecological or biophysical system these social feedback are context dependent and not necessarily tied to a specific type of water resilience function perturbation social feedback modifications may operate from individual to global scale and include a wide range of aspects m√ºller hansen et al 2017 wada et al 2017 such as social norms cultural values laws and regulations implementation castilla rho et al 2017 behavioral patterns chen et al 2012 traditions risk levels benchekroun and long 2014 uncertainty de zeeuw and zemel 2012 institutions galaz 2005 technology markets knowledge micklin 1988 and learning pahl wostl 2006 a wealth of studies explore social feedback in resource sharing context to understand the tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 and the conditions required to govern the commons ostrom 1990 commonly these relate to the blue water resilience functions supply carrier state productive and regulatory and the green water resilience function productive at the local to regional scale few studies have yet explored the social dynamics of green water resilience function moisture feedback keys and wang erlandsson 2018 indirect relation to green water resilience function regulatory can be found in studies that address for example global climate barrett 2013 nkuiya 2015 or land management meyfroidt et al 2018 3 2 social collapse the evidence that water has multiple functions tables 2 and 3 regulating the state and the resilience of biophysical systems combined with mounting evidence of water related and induced tipping points as water resilience is lost table 4 raises the major question of what implications loss of water resilience and crossing water tipping points have on societies table 5 illustrates a set of evidences and risks for social tipping points and collapsed civilizations failure has been generated in different ways in most cases triggered by severe drought years all show disastrous effects on management failures that lead to societal problems generated by biophysical collapses 4 water resilience processes in social ecological systems in this section we summarise and interpret the evidences presented in section 3 and discuss the general pattern that emerge state shifts in ecological and biophysical systems related to water often involve more than one water function and role disturbances in water functions might occur simultaneously interact or cascade accordingly the role of water for inducing regime shifts or linear collapse shifts between being a control state and driving variable 4 1 water functions mediate ecosystem tipping and collapse based on table 4 fig 5 illustrates the general way water mediate in ecosystem collapse through its eight functions section 2 3 and three roles section 2 2 at the local to regional scale for example 1 salinization which is primarily induced by irrigation using salinized water blue carrier function driving variable and moisture feedback green moisture feedback function state variable and secondarily by regulation of soil moisture green regulatory control and thirdly by loss in biomass production green productive control 2 savannization which is primarily induced by deforestation and climate change green moisture feedback driving secondly through decrease in biomass production green productive state and thirdly through impact on the climate system through albedo carbon and circulation feedback green regulatory state 3 desertification which is primarily induced by overgrazing green productive control and secondarily through decline in moisture feedback green moisture feedback driving 4 river basin closure which is primarily induced by unsustainable surface water withdrawal blue supply driving ability to support biomass growth blue productive driving and secondarily through moisture feedback as evaporation decreases green moisture feedback control 5 aquifer depletion which is primarily induced by unsustainable groundwater withdrawal blue supply driving decline in water volumes blue state state ability to support biomass growth blue productive driving and secondarily through moisture feedback as evaporation decreases green moisture feedback control 6 water logging which is primarily induced by water being accumulated in the soil blue state state and which has secondary effects on the biomass production green productive control although irrigation or groundwater caused water logging could be considered as affecting the blue productive function 7 eutrophication which is primarily induced by nutrient overload from agricultural fertilization blue carrier driving secondarily by shift in type of ecological biomass supported by the ecosystem blue productive state 8 aquatic system collapse which is primarily induced by dams and reservoirs that disrupt flow variation blue regulatory driving secondarily by demand in water for societal supply blue supply state biomass production blue productive state and change in water volumes blue state control fig 5 is a conceptualization of key processes useful for system understanding in generalized cases and specific cases might have more diverse causes and interactions a benefit of breaking down the roles and functions of water is how clearly it shows that water issues have profound implications and can be critically impacted by systems and sectors well beyond the traditional notion of a water sector that directly deals with visible liquid water in addition many climate land surface and hydrological models struggle to adequately reflect observed ecosystem regime shifts and may benefit from a systematic understanding of how water function disturbance and feedbacks may or may not be well represented in the model finally system understanding of the biophysical and ecological processes is fundamental for understanding the often much more elusive complex and context specific feedbacks in societal systems as we will discuss in the next section 4 2 life support systems changes can shake societies a rich archive of historic evidence shows how water scarcity and deterioration of water quality has contributed to the decline of ancient empires such as the maya the mesopotamian irrigation societies and the antique arab civilization section 3 2 there is rising indicative evidence of how deterioration of fundamental water functions for life support systems such as the collapse of food systems due to prolonged droughts which very likely amplified by anthropogenic global warming has contributed to accelerate and potentially accentuate human conflicts and national instability such as the arab spring and the syrian war gleick 2014 in more general terms land mismanagement may contribute to social system collapse by altering the terrestrial ecosystem to which the population has become used especially vulnerable have been irrigated civilizations in dry climate regions where the agriculture has included unsustainable components contributing causes of agricultural civilization s collapses include salinization water logging choking canals soil fertility decline etc the processes may be slow with progressive increase in salinization or water logging for which there is no remedy in sight societal problems may build up step by step as illustrated by the arab spring but finally have grown in size and complexity to a level impossible to compensate by countermeasures social collapse is thus a result of multiple interacting processes ranging across geopolitics economics values weak states and environmental shifts in simple terms when deterioration of natural economic and human capital manifests itself in collapse in human security rule of law and ultimately conflict at first resilience is eroded in the social economic system hydrological system and other biophysical systems through anthropogenic or natural disturbance of slow underlying variables as resilience is eroded it becomes more likely for a shock to manifest that potentially triggers a non linear regime shift or linear collapse in the biosphere and the society we attempt to illustrate this general social collapse process in fig 6 a in a more tangible example we interpret the syrian crisis through the resilience lens in fig 6b in the slow undercurrents of the societal land and climate system it is clear that resilience was low due to political instability land degradation and climate change that affected the local hydrological regime as drought triggered crop failure in the low resilient system people abandoned their rural land and migrated to cities where political tensions and instability reached new highs and contributed to the break out of the civil war clearly the societal collapse illustrated in these examples involve feedback with the ecological and biophysical systems in which the societies fundamentally are embedded and rely on this shows both a risk and an opportunity for management and governance of natural systems a resilient biophysical system reduces the risks for the society to cross the threshold towards collapse and a non resilient natural system can influence and in worst case trigger avoidable societal failures while the ancient case studies of societal collapse are limited to the regional scale regional agricultural collapse or failure in our modern era are compensated by for instance food import which may delay realization of resilience problems but potentially also risk larger scale of collapse if resilience erosion affects e g an entire trade network emerging disciplines of hydro sociology and socio hydrology are evidence of the recognised need to study coupled co evolving human water systems sivapalan et al 2012 further consideration of social resilience or hydrological resilience alone is distinctly different from consideration of their resilience of a coupled socio hydrological system mao et al 2017 4 3 building water resilience in the anthropocene in anthropocene the role of water for human development and sustainability has expanded in scope scale and speed placing water resilience at the core of integrated water resource management scope water resilience is no longer just about water they link to climate change dietary choice trade consumption and more when in the past water management effectively meant blue water management water managers of today need to consider vastly cross sectoral implications and green blue water interactions scale water issues have gone global in the past water were studied at the catchment scale lake scale or community scale but global scale drivers of climate and land use change is effectively mediating with the water cycle by melting glaciers changing rainfall patterns increasing drought risks rising sea levels etc water solutions now also need to be sought at the global scale and inter connectivity between scales need to be at the forefront speed changes in the water cycle and changes in the society are rapid and surprising competing with the hard and soft infrastructure development pace and societal learning and response rate and requiring societies to think plan and adapt proactively building water resilience in the anthropocene necessitates a paradigm shift from traditional blue water focused management to adaptive water management pahl wostl 2007 that takes into account interactions between green and blue water and the full water cycle relying on empirically derived resilience building principles maintain diversity manage connectivity manage slow variables and feedbacks foster complex adaptive systems thinking encourage learning broaden participation and promote polycentric governance biggs et al 2015 new tools to build resilience have emerged including resilience assessment and resilience planning sellberg et al 2018 that need to be further developed and employed in various contexts the water resilience functions identified in this paper have the further potential to be explored in terms of their usefulness for management and policy beyond the water sector 5 conclusions and future outlook water is behind all ecological goods and services from the biosphere that make human life on earth possible water is not only a generator of ecosystem services like food and energy it is also a critical agent of change e g functioning as a greenhouse gas and a regulator of temperature on earth and a victim of change e g through shocks like droughts and floods caused by global warming in this paper we put a further emphasis on the role of water as the bloodstream of the biosphere and thus key in sustaining all life on earth by integrating all different functions of water into one integrated framework namely water resilience water resilience defines the role of water in regulating the state of ecosystems biomes and the earth system through interactions and feedbacks of water related ecological functions in this paper we provide comprehensive evidence that water is associated with state shifts in social ecological systems as water functions cross critical tipping points pointing at the importance of understanding the role of water as a source of resilience its functioning is essential for earth system resilience and sustainable development we distinguish between eight parallel water functions and show the massive scale of the water flows and stocks by which they contribute to the functioning of components of the earth system green water related flows and stocks uphold three of these systems the energy and climate system biomass production and moisture feedback and hydrological recirculation and blue water flows and stocks uphold five systems related to societal water supply the nutrient and pollution transport the aquatic state of blue freshwater bodies and resources and the regulation of aquatic ecosystems and climate we clarify the profound role played by water flows as a function multiplier water flows corresponding up to 170 of the annual flow of terrestrial precipitation contribute to green water functions 100 means the same precipitation contribute to several functions and up to 100 to blue water functions all freshwater stocks serve fundamental functions for regulating the earth s climate and aquatic ecosystems human interference with green and blue water functions is considerable and examples of hydrologically coupled ecological system tipping points associated with non linear change are ample in literature a broad overview of cases provide evidence of erosion of water resilience in biophysical water related systems with tipping points in most cases multiple water functions are active in the loss of water resilience salinization savannization deforestation desertification river basin closure aquifer depletion water logging eutrophication aquatic system collapse the cases include several regional scale ecological systems and biomes savannas aquatic ecosystems amazon rainforest indian monsoon and the sahara desert water functions are linked also to societal collapse as evident in historical as well as modern time cases we provide mounting evidence of risks of crossing social tipping points as water related resilience is lost resulting in collapse of civilization degraded human security loss of rules of law and amplified conflicts most of these cases were triggered by severe drought events salinization water logging choking canals and soil fertility decline hitting agricultural civilizations land and water mismanagement alter the function and state of terrestrial ecosystems slowly or step by step until no remedy is in view the identified cases exemplify erosion of water resilience both through gradual system decline antique arab civilization and regime shifts maya civilization us dust bowl aral sea region arab spring syrian conflict regime shifts in the past have occurred at the local to regional scale but with the dawn of the anthropocene we now need to consider the risk of human induced regime shifts at the planetary scale rockstr√∂m et al 2009 steffen et al 2018 2015 in future research it will be important to better understand how loss of water resilience at the local scale may influence earth system resilience as a whole through for example cumulative integrative and cascading processes the most visible manifestation of climate change is displayed through the hydrological lens in the form of e g floods droughts and sea level rise that may trigger an understudied interplay of ecological biophysical and social feedbacks at the same time uncertainty prevails in climate model predictions of earth s future climate associated e g with clouds the water in the sky and the dynamics of biosphere carbon feedbacks related directly to water resilience thus the role of water for future earth system resilience will be essential to clarify human interference in all water functions green as well as blue is modifying life support systems on earth how will further global stresses caused by for instance ongoing climate change global population growth and increasing human demands continue to disturb the earth s life support system with its profound interactions between water flows functions and roles on the one hand and on the other essential ecological processes such as food production timber production and biodiversity and what risks will this involve in view of the strong driving forces in the anthropocene the complex interactions with social economic phenomena need special attention modern time teleconnections such as trade and migration can put some relief to water induced social stress and impacts of displacement however this may also temporarily mask resilience loss at the global scale finally the new understanding of water s critical roles for building resilience of the earth s life support system will lead to new types of questions what management related navigation options for the life support systems on earth will there exist to safeguard human wellbeing along realistic pathways that can keep the planet in the present favorable holocene like state with its relatively stable climate what transformations will be critical what shifts in governance approaches in terms of scopes scales and speed will be essential and how can they be achieved we challenge the scientific community to integrate water resilience thinking when exploring these grand challenges for humanity s future on earth funding this

8622,shallow groundwater extraction for irrigating park trees in the taipei basin is a sustainable solution for environmental resource management and urban landscape preservation because it reduces the potential for damage to the underground infrastructure caused by rising groundwater levels this study identified appropriate locations with clean and stable groundwater for irrigating park trees in the metropolitan taipei basin according to variability conditions of water quality first six hydrochemical parameters of groundwater associated with the taiwan irrigation water quality standard were collected from a 12 year taiwan environmental protection administration survey the first second and third quartiles of the six hydrochemical parameters were obtained to establish three estimation thresholds according to the irrigation water quality standard multivariate indicator kriging mvik was adopted to probabilistically evaluate the integration of the six hydrochemical parameters subsequently entropy based on the mvik estimates was applied to quantify the spatial and seasonal variability of the hydrochemical parameters finally the locations with high estimated probabilities and low local uncertainties were identified as appropriate locations for extracting groundwater to irrigate park trees the results revealed that mvik and entropy can be combined to determine the variability conditions of groundwater quality parameters and identify parks suitable for extracting groundwater for irrigation keywords groundwater irrigation park variability multivariate indicator kriging mvik entropy 1 introduction the metropolitan taipei basin situated in northern taiwan contains abundant groundwater rapid economic growth and urbanization between 1950 and 1970 led to the excessive exploitation of groundwater resulting in a marked decrease in groundwater levels approximately 50 m deep and severe land subsidence a vertical maximum settlement of 2 3 m chen et al 2007 hence in 1970 the taiwan government enacted an ordinance to rigidly regulate groundwater extraction from this basin consequently groundwater levels gradually increased by 1 3 m year between 1976 and 2004 wang 2005 in addition a surface reservoir was built on this basin in 1986 to supply a sufficient volume of water for household needs currently groundwater levels in most parts of this basin have recovered to a depth of 1 5 m below ground a marked decrease in groundwater levels and subsequent gradual recovery have also occurred in tokyo and osaka taniguchi et al 2008 hayashi et al 2009 however the rising groundwater levels are associated with the risk of disasters such as soil liquefaction for earthquakes liu et al 2010 and increasing buoyant forces exerted on underground infrastructure taniguchi et al 2008 hayashi et al 2009 foster et al 2011 moreover foster et al 2011 suggested that rapid reductions in urban groundwater use should be avoided because abrupt groundwater recovery can damage underground infrastructure accordingly groundwater in the taipei basin can be extracted appropriately for fire control irrigation of park and street trees and drinking liu et al 2010 jang et al 2012a in addition taniguchi et al 2008 mentioned that groundwater use is more sustainable in shallow aquifers than in deep aquifers because rapid water circulation reduces the potential of damage to underground infrastructure park landscapes are common in urban areas and many trees are planted in urban parks generally park trees have ecological environmental aesthetic educational social psychological and recreational benefits for urban residents chiesura 2004 millward and sabir 2010 to preserve urban landscapes establishing an effective and consistent irrigation plan is vital for park trees particularly during droughts whitlow et al 1992 thus shallow groundwater utilization for irrigating park trees is a sustainable solution for environmental resource management in the taipei basin groundwater quality is one of the most crucial factors for groundwater use for irrigation jang et al 2012b for example chloride cl is the most common ion in aquifers and results from mineral dissolution or seawater intrusion when water with a high cl content is used for irrigation the toxicity in water retards the growth of vegetables karaivazoglou et al 2005 grieve et al 2006 heavy metals such as manganese mn and iron fe frequently exist in reduced aquifers wang et al 2007 plant roots may absorb mn and fe in irrigation water adversely affecting vegetable growth aweng et al 2011 furthermore irrigation water with high nitrogen n content may cause quality problems in certain plants even though n compounds are generally regarded as nutrients for vegetable growth bauder et al 2012 moreover excessive n compounds that leak into aquifers after irrigation can exert substantial environmental and ecological impacts karaman et al 2005 indicator kriging ik the most primary nonparametric geostatistical approach involves no assumptions on the distributions of random variables and is less sensitive to extreme values journel 1988 webster and oliver 2007 saito and mckenna 2007 through this approach an indicator variable with binary transformation is employed to categorize hydrochemical parameters that exceed or meet an irrigation water quality standard chica olmo et al 2014 several studies have used ik to model spatial distributions and the variability of contaminants in soil or groundwater juang and lee 1998 castrignan√≤ et al 2000 van meirvenne and goovaerts 2001 liu et al 2004 goovaerts et al 2005 jang et al 2010 chica olmo et al 2014 however an irrigation water quality standard typically includes thresholds for many hydrochemical parameters hence the quality evaluation of groundwater exploitation for irrigation purposes should be conducted through a multivariate analysis approach jang and chen 2009 many studies have applied multivariate ik mvik to spatially characterize soil quality in farmlands smith et al 1993 oyedele et al 1996 halvorson et al 1996 diodato and ceccarelli 2004 mvik involves the integration of several soil chemical parameters other studies have adopted mvik to assess groundwater use for irrigation aquaculture and drinking purposes lee et al 2008 jang and chen 2009 jang et al 2012a b however the aforementioned studies have only used hydrochemical data from a single survey or average or median values obtained from several hydrochemical investigations to explore the feasibility of groundwater use neglecting the temporal variation in groundwater quality parameters in long term surveys of groundwater quality chen et al 2008 and awadallah 2012 proposed a combined kriging and entropy method to manage the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall and to plan a network of rainfall stations shyu et al 2011 also applied the combined kriging and entropy method to map and evaluate the seasonal variation in groundwater quality to reduce the potential of damage to underground infrastructure caused by rising groundwater levels this study identified appropriate locations with clean and stable shallow groundwater for irrigating park trees in the metropolitan taipei basin according to the variability conditions of water quality first six hydrochemical parameters of groundwater associated with the taiwan irrigation water quality standard were collected from a 12 year taiwan environmental protection administration epa survey the first second and third quartiles of the six hydrochemical parameters were acquired to establish three estimation thresholds mvik was adopted to probabilistically evaluate the integration of the six hydrochemical parameters according to the irrigation water quality standard subsequently entropy based on the mvik estimates was used to quantify the spatial and seasonal variability of groundwater quality parameters finally the locations with high estimated probabilities for the second quartile threshold and low local uncertainties were identified as appropriate locations for extracting groundwater to irrigate park trees 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the taipei basin is located in the metropolitan zone of taipei city and new taipei city and is surrounded by the linkou tableland in the west the tatun volcanoes in the north and the hsuehshan mountains in the southeast fig 1 the basin area below an elevation of 100 m above the mean sea level is approximately 430 km2 and the population in the metropolitan zone of taipei exceeds six million the dahan stream xindian stream and keelung river flow toward the northeast northwest and west respectively and then merge into the danshuei river the danshuei river is a major river in the taipei basin flowing northwestward into the taiwan strait according to data published by the taipei parks and street lights office 2012 and new taipei sports office 2012 486 parks situated in the taipei basin are the most popular locations for daily leisure for the residents of this basin the locations of these parks were identified using geographical information systems gis according to the longitude and latitude of the parks in addition according to climatic statistical data recorded between 2001 and 2012 the annual precipitation ranged from 1193 to 3028 mm with an average of 2295 mm the unconsolidated fluvial sediments underlying this basin are abundant in groundwater and are of the late quaternary age the bedrock at the bottom of this basin is composed of sedimentary rocks of the miocene age above the bedrock of the taipei basin the three hydrogeological sequences from the bottom to the top are the shinjuang jingmei and sungshan aquifers fig 2 the jingmei aquifer is the primary location for groundwater formation whereas the groundwater in the shinjuang and sungshan aquifers is relatively limited chia et al 1999 taniguchi et al 2008 suggested that shallow groundwater use should be environmentally sustainable thus this study assessed shallow groundwater extraction from the sungshan aquifer for irrigation purposes 2 2 hydrochemical data of groundwater the taiwan epa conducted quarterly surveys of groundwater quality parameters throughout taiwan between 2001 and 2012 and reported the survey data on its website a total of 48 monitoring wells in the taipei basin are located in the sungshan aquifer less than 20 m deep fig 1 the number of wells in the 12 year survey data ranged from 20 to 45 with an average of 37 5 the incompleteness of the data can be attributed to damage to certain wells between 2001 and 2012 this study used data on groundwater quality parameters reported by the taiwan epa 2012 to evaluate the spatial and seasonal variability as well as the uncertainty of hydrochemical parameters in the taipei basin temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec were in situ measured in a flow through cell every 5 min during well purging groundwater was sampled after ph and ec stabilization twenty additional hydrochemical parameters of groundwater were analyzed in a laboratory six hydrochemical parameters in the groundwater survey namely ec cl total n the sum of no3 n and nh4 n sulfate so4 2 fe and mn substantially exceeded the taiwan irrigation water quality standard taiwan council of agriculture 2012 furthermore this study examined the seasonal and annual variations in six groundwater quality parameters and mapped them by using a box and whisker plot in the supplementary material the analysis revealed that the seasonal difference in the hydrochemical parameters was less significant among various seasons and years and the annual precipitation was weakly correlated with the hydrochemical parameters r 0 23 to 0 40 thus in this study the temporal variability of the hydrochemical parameters was determined according to entropy this study adopted the first second and third quartiles of each hydrochemical parameter in each monitoring well to determine the seasonal variability of groundwater quality parameters table 1 lists the statistics on the six hydrochemical parameters of groundwater for the three quartiles statistical analysis revealed that most hydrochemical parameters were extensively distributed and highly skewed the distributions were examined through a kolmogorov smirnov normality test which indicated that the distributions were not normal or lognormal therefore a nonparametric geostatistical approach was appropriate to examine the distributions and uncertainty of the hydrochemical parameters 2 3 geostatistical approaches 2 3 1 variogram analysis an experimental variogram was employed to measure the spatial variability of random variables and was fitted to a theoretical model Œ≥ h which is a spherical exponential or gaussian model isaaks and srivastava 1989 goovaerts 1997 the nugget effect c0 sill c and range a were determined to fit the data to the theoretical model the anisotropy of the spatial variability can be analyzed along different directions i e a directional variogram a directional variogram typically contains geometric and zonal anisotropies deutsch 2002 this study considered only the geometric anisotropy of random variables 2 3 2 multivariate indicator kriging ik is a nonparametric geostatistical method for modeling the probability that the attribute value does not exceed a given threshold zk at a known location u goovaerts 1997 through this method the spatial variable z u is first converted into an indicator variable with a binary datum according to a certain threshold and is defined as follows goovaerts 1997 1 i k u z k 1 if z u z k 0 otherwise goovaerts 1997 illustrated that local prior information can served as soft continuous data to assess local uncertainty mvik of averaged indicator variables is a multivariate integration process that represents local prior cumulative distribution functions thus the integration variable is acquired by averaging the indicator variables of several hydrochemical parameters and expressed as follows diodato and ceccarelli 2004 2 i u z irri k 1 m i k u z k m where z irri is the threshold of the irrigation water quality standard and m is the number of indicator variables with respect to the irrigation water quality standard the m value in eq 2 is six the expected value of i u zirri depending on n surrounding data can be written as follows goovaerts 1997 3 e i u z irri n prob z u z irri n f u z irri n where f u zirri n is the conditional cumulative distribution function ccdf of z u zirri ik is a weighted average estimator and is expressed as follows goovaerts 1997 4 i u 0 z irri j 1 n Œª j z irri i u j z irri where i u j zirri is the indicator variable at the observed location u j and Œª j is the weighting factor of i u j zirri used to estimate i u 0 zirri this study used the gamv and kt3d codes in gslib deutsch and journel 1998 to establish the experimental variogram and to conduct mvik respectively in addition in a cross validation procedure the mean standard error mse and mean square standard error msse were used to quantify the performance of the determined variogram structure and kriging estimator the two parameters are expressed as follows chil√®s and delfiner 1999 5 mse 1 n i 1 n z u i z u i œÉ k u i 6 msse 1 n i 1 n z u i z u i 2 œÉ k 2 u i where z u i and z u i are the estimated and measured values of random variables respectively at the ith site n is the number of measured data sets and œÉ k u i and œÉ k 2 u i are the kriging standard deviation and variance respectively at the ith site the mse and msse which are close to 0 and 1 respectively represent that the fitting model and parameters of the determined theoretical variograms and the kriging estimators are robust moreover the msse suggested by chil√®s and delfiner 1999 with an accepted tolerance of 3 2 n 0 5 was used in this study ranging from 0 39 to 1 61 2 3 3 measure of local uncertainty this study used the second quartiles of hydrochemical parameters of groundwater obtained from a 12 year survey to spatially determine suitable locations for irrigation thus this study also examined the seasonal variability of hydrochemical parameters of groundwater local entropy was therefore adopted to quantify the seasonal uncertainty and variability generally the temporal distribution of random variables is discretized into k nonoverlapping classes z k 1 z k and the corresponding k probability intervals are defined as follows goovaerts 1997 7 p k u f u z k n f u z k 1 n the standardized entropy h r u determined using the ccdf can be expressed as follows goovaerts 1997 8 h r u k 1 k ln p k u p k u ln k where k k k is the number of nonzero probability intervals p k u 3 results 3 1 multivariate integration of hydrochemical parameters of groundwater each hydrochemical parameter of groundwater determined according to the first second or third quartile was first transformed into an indicator variable according to the irrigation water quality standard table 1 lists the irrigation water quality standard and the number of wells exceeding the standard for each hydrochemical parameter and quartile the lowest number of wells exceeded the standard for the cl and so4 2 parameters whereas the highest number of wells exceeded the standard for the mn parameter the multivariate integration variable of hydrochemical parameters was determined for each monitoring well according to eq 2 fig 3 shows the multivariate integration variables of hydrochemical parameters for various quartiles thirteen six and three monitoring wells met the irrigation water quality standard for the first second and third quartiles respectively the wells that met the irrigation water quality standard for the first quartile were distributed in the central partial northern partial western and partial eastern areas for the second quartile the wells were distributed in the central partial northern and partial eastern areas for the third quartile the wells were distributed in the central and partial western areas furthermore the multivariate integration variables of hydrochemical parameters ranged from 0 5 to 1 for the first quartile and from 0 167 to 1 for the second and third quartiles the averages of the multivariate integration variables of hydrochemical parameters were 0 82 0 75 and 0 69 for the first second and third quartiles respectively 3 2 variogram analyses for multivariate integration variables of hydrochemical parameters this study adopted the first second and third quartiles of multivariate integration variables of hydrochemical parameters to establish three estimation thresholds to obtain a stable spatial variogram structure the experimental variograms of multivariate integration variables of hydrochemical parameters were analyzed using a lag of 1000 m in the kriging algorithm a high weight is assigned for a short distance variable thus the fitting theoretical variogram model should be more precise at a short distance than at a long distance when a least squares approach is used to obtain a best fitting model with the lowest sum of squares of errors cressie 1985 in this study an exponential model had an excellent fit for the variograms fig 4 the fitted range nugget effect and sill were 9000 m 0 009 and 0 021 respectively for the first quartile threshold 10000 m 0 015 and 0 028 respectively for the second quartile threshold and 7500 m 0 005 and 0 041 respectively for the third quartile threshold table 2 the exponential model used to fit the omnidirectional variograms was used to examine the directional variograms of geometric anisotropy because the model was of the same type and exhibited the same variability as the geometric anisotropic model deutsch and journel 1998 the directions of maximum variability were determined at n150 e n0 e and n30 e for the first second and third quartile thresholds respectively the anisotropic ratios maximum range minimum range were 2 33 1 71 and 2 00 for the first second and third quartile thresholds respectively 3 3 assessment of suitable groundwater use for irrigating park trees according to mvik and entropy this study estimated the occurrence probabilities of the multivariate integration of hydrochemical parameters by using mvik for three estimation thresholds a discretized grid with dimensions of 77 66 cells and spacing of 500 m was used to calculate the ik estimates the estimated probabilities may be more than unity or less than nil at each threshold causing an order relation deviation and a violation of monotonic increases in the ccdf goovaerts 1997 goovaerts 1997 suggested averaging the results of an upward and downward correction of ccdf values in this study all the analytic procedures suggested by goovaerts 1997 were followed to solve the aforementioned problems regarding the ccdf at the three estimation thresholds fig 5 displays the estimated probabilities of f u zirri n for the thresholds a higher f u zirri n represents higher suitability of groundwater use for irrigating park trees for the first

hydrochemical parameter exceeds the irrigation water quality standard jang and chen 2009 therefore this study spatially determined suitable locations for irrigating park trees according to f u zirri n

several benefits for environmental resource management ecology and urban landscape preservation however no study has examined the hydrogeological properties of the sungshan aquifer in the taipei basin resulting in difficulty in quantitatively assessing groundwater extraction from the shallow aquifer a simple management strategy is that groundwater should not be extracted below the bottom of the sungshan aquifer the thickness of the sungshan aquifer in the recommended parks is approximately 10 m therefore this study suggests that the 10 m depth from the ground surface to groundwater levels is the maximum for sustainable groundwater use for irrigating park trees moreover groundwater levels should be periodically monitored to ensure the sustainable use of urban groundwater resources our

groundwater is not appropriate for irrigating park trees in the other nonrecommended parks it can still be used for washing or fire control purposes in the taipei basin to promote reasonable and

8622,shallow groundwater extraction for irrigating park trees in the taipei basin is a sustainable solution for environmental resource management and urban landscape preservation because it reduces the potential for damage to the underground infrastructure caused by rising groundwater levels this study identified appropriate locations with clean and stable groundwater for irrigating park trees in the metropolitan taipei basin according to variability conditions of water quality first six hydrochemical parameters of groundwater associated with the taiwan irrigation water quality standard were collected from a 12 year taiwan environmental protection administration survey the first second and third quartiles of the six hydrochemical parameters were obtained to establish three estimation thresholds according to the irrigation water quality standard multivariate indicator kriging mvik was adopted to probabilistically evaluate the integration of the six hydrochemical parameters subsequently entropy based on the mvik estimates was applied to quantify the spatial and seasonal variability of the hydrochemical parameters finally the locations with high estimated probabilities and low local uncertainties were identified as appropriate locations for extracting groundwater to irrigate park trees the results revealed that mvik and entropy can be combined to determine the variability conditions of groundwater quality parameters and identify parks suitable for extracting groundwater for irrigation keywords groundwater irrigation park variability multivariate indicator kriging mvik entropy 1 introduction the metropolitan taipei basin situated in northern taiwan contains abundant groundwater rapid economic growth and urbanization between 1950 and 1970 led to the excessive exploitation of groundwater resulting in a marked decrease in groundwater levels approximately 50 m deep and severe land subsidence a vertical maximum settlement of 2 3 m chen et al 2007 hence in 1970 the taiwan government enacted an ordinance to rigidly regulate groundwater extraction from this basin consequently groundwater levels gradually increased by 1 3 m year between 1976 and 2004 wang 2005 in addition a surface reservoir was built on this basin in 1986 to supply a sufficient volume of water for household needs currently groundwater levels in most parts of this basin have recovered to a depth of 1 5 m below ground a marked decrease in groundwater levels and subsequent gradual recovery have also occurred in tokyo and osaka taniguchi et al 2008 hayashi et al 2009 however the rising groundwater levels are associated with the risk of disasters such as soil liquefaction for earthquakes liu et al 2010 and increasing buoyant forces exerted on underground infrastructure taniguchi et al 2008 hayashi et al 2009 foster et al 2011 moreover foster et al 2011 suggested that rapid reductions in urban groundwater use should be avoided because abrupt groundwater recovery can damage underground infrastructure accordingly groundwater in the taipei basin can be extracted appropriately for fire control irrigation of park and street trees and drinking liu et al 2010 jang et al 2012a in addition taniguchi et al 2008 mentioned that groundwater use is more sustainable in shallow aquifers than in deep aquifers because rapid water circulation reduces the potential of damage to underground infrastructure park landscapes are common in urban areas and many trees are planted in urban parks generally park trees have ecological environmental aesthetic educational social psychological and recreational benefits for urban residents chiesura 2004 millward and sabir 2010 to preserve urban landscapes establishing an effective and consistent irrigation plan is vital for park trees particularly during droughts whitlow et al 1992 thus shallow groundwater utilization for irrigating park trees is a sustainable solution for environmental resource management in the taipei basin groundwater quality is one of the most crucial factors for groundwater use for irrigation jang et al 2012b for example chloride cl is the most common ion in aquifers and results from mineral dissolution or seawater intrusion when water with a high cl content is used for irrigation the toxicity in water retards the growth of vegetables karaivazoglou et al 2005 grieve et al 2006 heavy metals such as manganese mn and iron fe frequently exist in reduced aquifers wang et al 2007 plant roots may absorb mn and fe in irrigation water adversely affecting vegetable growth aweng et al 2011 furthermore irrigation water with high nitrogen n content may cause quality problems in certain plants even though n compounds are generally regarded as nutrients for vegetable growth bauder et al 2012 moreover excessive n compounds that leak into aquifers after irrigation can exert substantial environmental and ecological impacts karaman et al 2005 indicator kriging ik the most primary nonparametric geostatistical approach involves no assumptions on the distributions of random variables and is less sensitive to extreme values journel 1988 webster and oliver 2007 saito and mckenna 2007 through this approach an indicator variable with binary transformation is employed to categorize hydrochemical parameters that exceed or meet an irrigation water quality standard chica olmo et al 2014 several studies have used ik to model spatial distributions and the variability of contaminants in soil or groundwater juang and lee 1998 castrignan√≤ et al 2000 van meirvenne and goovaerts 2001 liu et al 2004 goovaerts et al 2005 jang et al 2010 chica olmo et al 2014 however an irrigation water quality standard typically includes thresholds for many hydrochemical parameters hence the quality evaluation of groundwater exploitation for irrigation purposes should be conducted through a multivariate analysis approach jang and chen 2009 many studies have applied multivariate ik mvik to spatially characterize soil quality in farmlands smith et al 1993 oyedele et al 1996 halvorson et al 1996 diodato and ceccarelli 2004 mvik involves the integration of several soil chemical parameters other studies have adopted mvik to assess groundwater use for irrigation aquaculture and drinking purposes lee et al 2008 jang and chen 2009 jang et al 2012a b however the aforementioned studies have only used hydrochemical data from a single survey or average or median values obtained from several hydrochemical investigations to explore the feasibility of groundwater use neglecting the temporal variation in groundwater quality parameters in long term surveys of groundwater quality chen et al 2008 and awadallah 2012 proposed a combined kriging and entropy method to manage the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall and to plan a network of rainfall stations shyu et al 2011 also applied the combined kriging and entropy method to map and evaluate the seasonal variation in groundwater quality to reduce the potential of damage to underground infrastructure caused by rising groundwater levels this study identified appropriate locations with clean and stable shallow groundwater for irrigating park trees in the metropolitan taipei basin according to the variability conditions of water quality first six hydrochemical parameters of groundwater associated with the taiwan irrigation water quality standard were collected from a 12 year taiwan environmental protection administration epa survey the first second and third quartiles of the six hydrochemical parameters were acquired to establish three estimation thresholds mvik was adopted to probabilistically evaluate the integration of the six hydrochemical parameters according to the irrigation water quality standard subsequently entropy based on the mvik estimates was used to quantify the spatial and seasonal variability of groundwater quality parameters finally the locations with high estimated probabilities for the second quartile threshold and low local uncertainties were identified as appropriate locations for extracting groundwater to irrigate park trees 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the taipei basin is located in the metropolitan zone of taipei city and new taipei city and is surrounded by the linkou tableland in the west the tatun volcanoes in the north and the hsuehshan mountains in the southeast fig 1 the basin area below an elevation of 100 m above the mean sea level is approximately 430 km2 and the population in the metropolitan zone of taipei exceeds six million the dahan stream xindian stream and keelung river flow toward the northeast northwest and west respectively and then merge into the danshuei river the danshuei river is a major river in the taipei basin flowing northwestward into the taiwan strait according to data published by the taipei parks and street lights office 2012 and new taipei sports office 2012 486 parks situated in the taipei basin are the most popular locations for daily leisure for the residents of this basin the locations of these parks were identified using geographical information systems gis according to the longitude and latitude of the parks in addition according to climatic statistical data recorded between 2001 and 2012 the annual precipitation ranged from 1193 to 3028 mm with an average of 2295 mm the unconsolidated fluvial sediments underlying this basin are abundant in groundwater and are of the late quaternary age the bedrock at the bottom of this basin is composed of sedimentary rocks of the miocene age above the bedrock of the taipei basin the three hydrogeological sequences from the bottom to the top are the shinjuang jingmei and sungshan aquifers fig 2 the jingmei aquifer is the primary location for groundwater formation whereas the groundwater in the shinjuang and sungshan aquifers is relatively limited chia et al 1999 taniguchi et al 2008 suggested that shallow groundwater use should be environmentally sustainable thus this study assessed shallow groundwater extraction from the sungshan aquifer for irrigation purposes 2 2 hydrochemical data of groundwater the taiwan epa conducted quarterly surveys of groundwater quality parameters throughout taiwan between 2001 and 2012 and reported the survey data on its website a total of 48 monitoring wells in the taipei basin are located in the sungshan aquifer less than 20 m deep fig 1 the number of wells in the 12 year survey data ranged from 20 to 45 with an average of 37 5 the incompleteness of the data can be attributed to damage to certain wells between 2001 and 2012 this study used data on groundwater quality parameters reported by the taiwan epa 2012 to evaluate the spatial and seasonal variability as well as the uncertainty of hydrochemical parameters in the taipei basin temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec were in situ measured in a flow through cell every 5 min during well purging groundwater was sampled after ph and ec stabilization twenty additional hydrochemical parameters of groundwater were analyzed in a laboratory six hydrochemical parameters in the groundwater survey namely ec cl total n the sum of no3 n and nh4 n sulfate so4 2 fe and mn substantially exceeded the taiwan irrigation water quality standard taiwan council of agriculture 2012 furthermore this study examined the seasonal and annual variations in six groundwater quality parameters and mapped them by using a box and whisker plot in the supplementary material the analysis revealed that the seasonal difference in the hydrochemical parameters was less significant among various seasons and years and the annual precipitation was weakly correlated with the hydrochemical parameters r 0 23 to 0 40 thus in this study the temporal variability of the hydrochemical parameters was determined according to entropy this study adopted the first second and third quartiles of each hydrochemical parameter in each monitoring well to determine the seasonal variability of groundwater quality parameters table 1 lists the statistics on the six hydrochemical parameters of groundwater for the three quartiles statistical analysis revealed that most hydrochemical parameters were extensively distributed and highly skewed the distributions were examined through a kolmogorov smirnov normality test which indicated that the distributions were not normal or lognormal therefore a nonparametric geostatistical approach was appropriate to examine the distributions and uncertainty of the hydrochemical parameters 2 3 geostatistical approaches 2 3 1 variogram analysis an experimental variogram was employed to measure the spatial variability of random variables and was fitted to a theoretical model Œ≥ h which is a spherical exponential or gaussian model isaaks and srivastava 1989 goovaerts 1997 the nugget effect c0 sill c and range a were determined to fit the data to the theoretical model the anisotropy of the spatial variability can be analyzed along different directions i e a directional variogram a directional variogram typically contains geometric and zonal anisotropies deutsch 2002 this study considered only the geometric anisotropy of random variables 2 3 2 multivariate indicator kriging ik is a nonparametric geostatistical method for modeling the probability that the attribute value does not exceed a given threshold zk at a known location u goovaerts 1997 through this method the spatial variable z u is first converted into an indicator variable with a binary datum according to a certain threshold and is defined as follows goovaerts 1997 1 i k u z k 1 if z u z k 0 otherwise goovaerts 1997 illustrated that local prior information can served as soft continuous data to assess local uncertainty mvik of averaged indicator variables is a multivariate integration process that represents local prior cumulative distribution functions thus the integration variable is acquired by averaging the indicator variables of several hydrochemical parameters and expressed as follows diodato and ceccarelli 2004 2 i u z irri k 1 m i k u z k m where z irri is the threshold of the irrigation water quality standard and m is the number of indicator variables with respect to the irrigation water quality standard the m value in eq 2 is six the expected value of i u zirri depending on n surrounding data can be written as follows goovaerts 1997 3 e i u z irri n prob z u z irri n f u z irri n where f u zirri n is the conditional cumulative distribution function ccdf of z u zirri ik is a weighted average estimator and is expressed as follows goovaerts 1997 4 i u 0 z irri j 1 n Œª j z irri i u j z irri where i u j zirri is the indicator variable at the observed location u j and Œª j is the weighting factor of i u j zirri used to estimate i u 0 zirri this study used the gamv and kt3d codes in gslib deutsch and journel 1998 to establish the experimental variogram and to conduct mvik respectively in addition in a cross validation procedure the mean standard error mse and mean square standard error msse were used to quantify the performance of the determined variogram structure and kriging estimator the two parameters are expressed as follows chil√®s and delfiner 1999 5 mse 1 n i 1 n z u i z u i œÉ k u i 6 msse 1 n i 1 n z u i z u i 2 œÉ k 2 u i where z u i and z u i are the estimated and measured values of random variables respectively at the ith site n is the number of measured data sets and œÉ k u i and œÉ k 2 u i are the kriging standard deviation and variance respectively at the ith site the mse and msse which are close to 0 and 1 respectively represent that the fitting model and parameters of the determined theoretical variograms and the kriging estimators are robust moreover the msse suggested by chil√®s and delfiner 1999 with an accepted tolerance of 3 2 n 0 5 was used in this study ranging from 0 39 to 1 61 2 3 3 measure of local uncertainty this study used the second quartiles of hydrochemical parameters of groundwater obtained from a 12 year survey to spatially determine suitable locations for irrigation thus this study also examined the seasonal variability of hydrochemical parameters of groundwater local entropy was therefore adopted to quantify the seasonal uncertainty and variability generally the temporal distribution of random variables is discretized into k nonoverlapping classes z k 1 z k and the corresponding k probability intervals are defined as follows goovaerts 1997 7 p k u f u z k n f u z k 1 n the standardized entropy h r u determined using the ccdf can be expressed as follows goovaerts 1997 8 h r u k 1 k ln p k u p k u ln k where k k k is the number of nonzero probability intervals p k u 3 results 3 1 multivariate integration of hydrochemical parameters of groundwater each hydrochemical parameter of groundwater determined according to the first second or third quartile was first transformed into an indicator variable according to the irrigation water quality standard table 1 lists the irrigation water quality standard and the number of wells exceeding the standard for each hydrochemical parameter and quartile the lowest number of wells exceeded the standard for the cl and so4 2 parameters whereas the highest number of wells exceeded the standard for the mn parameter the multivariate integration variable of hydrochemical parameters was determined for each monitoring well according to eq 2 fig 3 shows the multivariate integration variables of hydrochemical parameters for various quartiles thirteen six and three monitoring wells met the irrigation water quality standard for the first second and third quartiles respectively the wells that met the irrigation water quality standard for the first quartile were distributed in the central partial northern partial western and partial eastern areas for the second quartile the wells were distributed in the central partial northern and partial eastern areas for the third quartile the wells were distributed in the central and partial western areas furthermore the multivariate integration variables of hydrochemical parameters ranged from 0 5 to 1 for the first quartile and from 0 167 to 1 for the second and third quartiles the averages of the multivariate integration variables of hydrochemical parameters were 0 82 0 75 and 0 69 for the first second and third quartiles respectively 3 2 variogram analyses for multivariate integration variables of hydrochemical parameters this study adopted the first second and third quartiles of multivariate integration variables of hydrochemical parameters to establish three estimation thresholds to obtain a stable spatial variogram structure the experimental variograms of multivariate integration variables of hydrochemical parameters were analyzed using a lag of 1000 m in the kriging algorithm a high weight is assigned for a short distance variable thus the fitting theoretical variogram model should be more precise at a short distance than at a long distance when a least squares approach is used to obtain a best fitting model with the lowest sum of squares of errors cressie 1985 in this study an exponential model had an excellent fit for the variograms fig 4 the fitted range nugget effect and sill were 9000 m 0 009 and 0 021 respectively for the first quartile threshold 10000 m 0 015 and 0 028 respectively for the second quartile threshold and 7500 m 0 005 and 0 041 respectively for the third quartile threshold table 2 the exponential model used to fit the omnidirectional variograms was used to examine the directional variograms of geometric anisotropy because the model was of the same type and exhibited the same variability as the geometric anisotropic model deutsch and journel 1998 the directions of maximum variability were determined at n150 e n0 e and n30 e for the first second and third quartile thresholds respectively the anisotropic ratios maximum range minimum range were 2 33 1 71 and 2 00 for the first second and third quartile thresholds respectively 3 3 assessment of suitable groundwater use for irrigating park trees according to mvik and entropy this study estimated the occurrence probabilities of the multivariate integration of hydrochemical parameters by using mvik for three estimation thresholds a discretized grid with dimensions of 77 66 cells and spacing of 500 m was used to calculate the ik estimates the estimated probabilities may be more than unity or less than nil at each threshold causing an order relation deviation and a violation of monotonic increases in the ccdf goovaerts 1997 goovaerts 1997 suggested averaging the results of an upward and downward correction of ccdf values in this study all the analytic procedures suggested by goovaerts 1997 were followed to solve the aforementioned problems regarding the ccdf at the three estimation

the areas with medium local uncertainty were distributed between those with the high and low local uncertainty types a location with a f u zirri n value exceeding 0 833 at the second quartile

castillo et al 2005 jordaan 2005 mcneil et al 2005 reiss and thomas 2007 there exist several commercial and open software packages for the purposes of eva stephenson and gilleland 2005 gilleland et al 2013 the advantage of the extreme value theory is that ideally the original parent distribution and its cumulative distribution function need not to be known because the distribution of the extremes asymptotically approaches a known distribution historically fisher and tippett 1928 gumbel 1958 the extreme value theory has been utilized so that the extremes are assumed to be distributed according to one of the theoretical asymptotic extreme value distributions weibull fr√©chet or gumbel depending on an a priori assumption of the parent distribution nowadays these distributions are usually combined into the generalized extreme value distribution gev with a probability density function pdf as 1 f x exp 1 Œ≥ x Œº Œ± 1 Œ≥ where Œ± 0 and 1 Œ≥ x Œº Œ± 0 gev is a three parameter distribution the limiting value of which at Œ≥ 0 is the gumbel distribution 2 f x exp exp y where y is the reduced variate 3 y x Œº Œ± here Œº is the location parameter and Œ± is the scale parameter the gev distribution has a finite upper tail for the shape parameter Œ≥ 0 weibull whereas for Œ≥ 0 fr√©chet and Œ≥ 0 gumbel there is no upper bound the fit to estimate the parameters Œº and Œ± is traditionally performed on a gumbel probability graph where the ordinate is the reduced variate from the estimated f x plotted as y l n l n f x and the abscissa is the variate value x this plot transforms the gumbel distribution model into a line with a slope of 1 Œ± and intercept Œº Œ± once the fit is made and the parameters Œº and Œ± are determined one can calculate x that corresponds to any probability f x p and the corresponding return period r often one will need to estimate extreme values of x that are higher than those included in the data graphically this corresponds to extrapolation along the fit on the graph fig 1 the modern method is to use the gev distribution eq 1 and apply some fitting procedure however there is no universally accepted method of eva in contrast different authors and software provide different methods and often propose several alternative means for the related procedures thus in practice performing eva involves considerable subjectivity eva is typically performed either by using the maximum likelihood method mle or the probability weighted moments method pwm or by associating each observation to its probability and making a fit in the latter case one needs to select the a priori functional form of the cumulative distribution function cdf of the extreme value data the plotting formula the method of weighing the data the fitting method three theoretically based extreme value distributions exist for the cdf fifteen plotting formula are proposed in the literature and seven methods are commonly used for the weighing of data the fitting can be done with respect to either probability or the variable itself on a probability plot bayesian methods are also in use consequently there are around 1000 ways to perform eva this means that the results of eva presented in the literature and used for important decision making are contaminated with significant methodological uncertainties as demonstrated earlier makkonen 2006 2008a this may result in serious underestimation of risks when the observed data sets are small here an improved and more objective method of eva is presented in this method none of the selections discussed above need to be made by the user instead a three parameter generalized extreme value distribution gev is applied the plotting is based on the true rank probabilities and the weighing and fitting are linked to each other by solving their optimal selection iteratively we then shown by monte carlo simulations that this method outperforms the other widely used methods of eva including the mle and pwm particularly for small data sets finally the benefits and weaknesses of this novel method are discussed 2 the eva method 2 1 the fitted distribution in the method proposed here gev is used and all its three parameters are varied it should be emphasized that the use of gev here is not based merely on an assumption that the observations are extremes from an infinite set of data i e on full convergence towards the asymptotic extreme value distribution rather this selection is based on that even in the case of incomplete convergence i e the so called penultimate distribution extreme value data can be fitted by a three parameter gev very well furrer and katz 2008 thus in principle the method is applicable to any type of iid block extreme data 2 2 the plotting positions the cumulative distribution function of n number of annual maxima is estimated from the order statistics so that each maximum is assigned a rank m in ascending value 1 m n for a conventional analysis of order ranked extremes one needs to associate them to some probability the so called plotting position this is done here by the formula 4 p m m n 1 it has been shown makkonen 2006 2008a b makkonen et al 2013 that this so called weibull plotting position provides the correct rank probability for any distribution of extremes 2 3 weighing and fitting there is significant controversy related to the methods of fitting a distribution to extreme value data katz et al 2002 makkonen 2008a for example the performance of the maximum likelihood method for the gev distribution may be erratic for small samples martins and stedinger 2000 and the method of probability weighed moments is not optimal for the gumbel distributed samples rasmussen and gautam 2003 our fitting method deviates from the conventional methods and is described below in the conventional fitting methods the error i e the difference between the data and the model output is minimized with respect to the probability p in contrast in our method the differences are minimized with respect to the variate x this is motivated by the fact that in the case of order ranked data p is not a variate makkonen and pajari 2014 and that monte carlo simulations support this choice pajari et al 2019 this choice of the axis is one of the key elements in the success of the method demonstrated in this paper there are number of ways to fit a distribution to the plotted data in addition to the simple method of least squares methods that weigh each extreme based to its statistical confidence have been proposed lieblein 1974 landwehr et al 1979 hosking et al 1985 wang 1991 castillo 1988 katz et al 2002 it is noteworthy that all curve fitting techniques implicitly involve giving weights to the data points in eva the issue of the weights is particularly important and controversial giving larger weights to the most extreme observations may be supported by the possibility that the highest extremes do not belong to the same population with more moderate extremes thus putting more weight on the points with a low probability would seem to be necessary for the phenomena whose formation mechanisms are poorly understood however this line of thinking contradicts the commonly used approach harris 1996 landwehr et al 1979 hosking et al 1985 in which the points are weighted based on their confidence thus effectively neglecting the data at the tail of the distribution in our method the weighted least squares are used in making the fit to gev as mentioned above in our fitting method the errors are minimized with respect to the random variable x and not p for this purpose Œæ m is solved from the gev distribution eq 1 as 5 Œæ m f 1 m n 1 Œº Œ± Œ≥ 1 ln f Œæ m Œ≥ here Œæ m is the value of x given by the estimate of the cumulative distribution function f at the probability corresponding to the observation x m in the method the weights w m for the data points are given according to the inverse of the variance of Œæ m the variance can be calculated when the cumulative distribution function at f Œæ m is known this is explained below consider the stochastic variable x m from the order ranked data 6 x 1 x 2 x n there are m 1 independent stochastic variables less than and n m larger than x m hence the probability density function f m Œæ m of x m can be determined by e g castillo 1988 7 f m Œæ m n m 1 n m f Œæ m m 1 1 f Œæ m n m f Œæ m where m is rank number n is the total number of variables f Œæ m is the cumulative distribution function and f Œæ m is the density function for the gev distribution f Œæ m is given by eq 1 and 8 f x 1 Œ± 1 Œ≥ x Œº Œ± 1 Œ≥ 1 exp 1 Œ≥ x Œº Œ± 1 Œ≥ for x Œº Œ± Œ≥ when Œ≥ 0 and for x Œº Œ± Œ≥ when Œ≥ 0 outside this range the density is zero when Œ≥ 0 the density function is defined as 9 f x 1 Œ± exp x Œº Œ± exp exp x Œº Œ± hence mean of the variable Œæ m are numerically calculated from the distribution function by 10 Œæ m Œæ m f m Œæ m d Œæ m and the variance œÉ m 2 by 11 œÉ m 2 Œæ m Œæ m 2 f m Œæ m d Œæ m the weights w m are then determined by equation 12 w m 1 œÉ m 2 and are normalized so that 13 m k n w m 1 where k is the index of smallest value of x k that is taken into account in the fitting as explained below using these weights the sum 14 m k n w m x m Œæ m 2 is minimized thus in this method an estimate of the cumulative distribution function f Œæ needs to be applied when determining the weights on the other hand the weights are required in determining an estimate of f Œæ this situation is solved by considering both the weights and the fitted function simultaneously in an iteration process as explained in the following first equal weights are given for all the extremes for obtaining the first estimate of the distribution function and the weights for the second run at each iteration step the weights are adjusted according to eqs 11 14 and the three parameters of gev are found by minimizing the sum in eq 14 when the estimated cumulative distribution function f Œæ and the weights w m do not change anymore in the iteration the cdf f Œæ is accepted as the final result typically 10 20 iteration steps are required while testing the method excessively for example by 44 800 natural samples in fig 4 no data sets were found for which the method would not converge in some cases the variable x may have an absolute lower limit according to the fitted gev this can sometimes be seen also in real data for example the amount of snow on the ground for which the limiting value is zero since in eva we are interested in the upper tail of the distribution values at the lower limit are not useful therefore a criterion on how close to the theoretical lower limit the smallest observed extremes are is applied and they are rejected from the analysis accordingly this is explained in detail in the following the smallest extremes are excluded in our analysis i e they are given zero weights if they lay very close to the lower asymptotic limit given by the estimated f Œæ this is done based on the criterion which compares the difference between the smallest and the second smallest Œæ m value Œæ k and Œæ k 1 respectively and the difference between the largest value Œæ n and the smallest value Œæ k if 15 Œæ k 1 Œæ k Œæ n Œæ k b then the smallest observation is eliminated from the analysis and only observations from x k 1 to x n are used in the new iteration process the elimination process continues to the next smallest extreme until the criterion in eq 15 is not met if there are no more than five observations left for the analysis then the data are considered unreliable and rejected here b 0 001 is used in eq 15 2 4 confidence intervals when using this method for each rank confidence intervals can be determined by calculating the quantile of interest from eq 7 these rank intervals can be transferred from the probability scale to the variable scale as an example fig 1 shows a gev distribution that has been fitted to the rank confidence intervals which have been interpolated between each rank and extrapolated here the standard deviation of the m th largest order statistic has been used as a confidence level of interest 3 performance of the vwls method 3 1 evaluation of a fitting method we call our improved eva method described above vwls since it combines minimization of the variance in x v weibull plotting positions w and least squares ls for demonstrating the power of vwls we investigate in the following how well different methods estimate the true cdf of extremes to compare the methods a procedure described in makkonen et al 2013 and pajari et al 2019 is used instead of the conventional comparison of the statistics of the distribution parameters or the quantiles the compelling reasons for this are outlined in the following the distribution parameters Œ≥ Œº and Œ± are non linearly related to p f x therefore there is no reason to believe that e g the bias of the estimated distribution parameters can be used as a measure of a good fit for the distribution itself another way to express this argument is to note that a non linear transformation of an unbiased estimator is biased consequently contrary to the commonly applied intuition good estimates of the distribution parameters do not necessarily imply a good fit of the distribution see pajari et al 2019 we demonstrate the misleading nature of assessing the goodness of fit by the distribution parameters by a simple example in fig 2 the tail of a gumbel distribution with Œº 0 Œ± 1 is shown as the solid line and two estimates for it one with Œº 0 05 Œ± 1 045 blue dashed line and another with Œº 0 1 Œ± 0 95 red dashed line are also shown both parameters Œº and Œ± are closer to the correct values for the blue line nevertheless the red line provides much better estimates for the probability of the extreme values when the distribution includes several parameters three in the case of gev the use of the goodness of the parameters in evaluating the goodness of the fit is even more misleading in such a case the properties of a single parameter do not tell anything of the goodness of fit in terms of e g quantiles and a situation may arise where errors in the parameters cancel out in some range of values but not in others another popular method has been to use the bias or rms error of the quantiles as a measure of goodness of fit however for distributions such as gev also the quantiles are non linearly related to the probability thus e g the bias of a quantile is an inappropriate measure in probabilistic sense pajari et al 2019 accordingly the goodness of fit in the eva methods need to be compared not by the statistics of the parameters Œ≥ Œº Œ± nor the quantiles but by the property for which the cdf estimates are defined i e the probability this can be assessed by considering the frequency of samples falling into equally spaced probability intervals makkonen et al 2013 pajari et al 2019 this is explained in the following assume a variate x and its cumulative distribution function f divide the probability axis in p 1 equal intervals by values i p 1 i 0 p 1 and calculate values x i f 1 i p 1 by definition for an arbitrary observation x the probability of falling to bin x i 1 x i equals 1 p 1 for i 1 p 1 and for all positive integers p hence with increasing number of observations the relative frequency of observations x falling to bin x i 1 x i approaches the probability 1 p 1 this fundamental property can be used when comparing fitting methods the appropriate evaluation method can be outlined by the following steps 1 choose a cdf f x 2 take a sample including n values of x which are x 1 x n in ascending order 3 using this sample and the different fitting methods find the respective estimated cdf f 1 x f 2 x 4 take the next random value x n 1 from the population of x 5 record for each function f j x the bin f j 1 r 1 n 1 f j 1 r n 1 to which x n 1 belongs 6 repeat n times steps 2 5 until the relative frequency n j r n number of x n 1 values falling in bin r divided by n no more changes 7 the goodness of the fitting procedure can now be evaluated using the root squared sum c as 16 c r 1 n 1 n j r n 1 n 1 2 3 2 comparison of eva methods monte carlo simulations with 100 000 rounds to calculate the bin frequency and c were made by fitting the data using the maximum likelihood method fisher 1922 hosking 1985 the probability weighted moments greenwood et al 1979 hosking et al 1985 l moments hosking 1990 hosking and wallis 1997 and lh2 moments wang 1997 as well as the vwls method presented here the random data were produced from gumbel fr√©chet and weibull type distributions for demonstrating the method in case of extreme value distributions the parameters of the distributions were selected so that they represent typical values in environmental data an example of the distribution of samples into the bins in these simulations is shown in fig 3 the results of c for fr√©chet distribution with parameters Œ≥ 0 3 Œ± 10 and Œº 70 are shown in table 1 the columns of the table show c for simulations by different methods the ideal column presents c with respect to the actual distribution in question this value is calculated by replacing the fitted cdf f j x in step 5 by the actual chosen cdf f x similar results for the reversed weibull distribution with parameters Œ≥ 0 3 Œ± 10 and Œº 70 are shown in table 2 and for the gumbel distribution with parameters Œ± 10 and Œº 70 in table 3 however it is noteworthy that for a fixed shape parameter a gev distribution is location scale invariant so that the results are the same as given in tables 1 3 when say Œº 0 and Œ± 1 the results in tables 1 3 show that for data simulated from the three types of extreme value distributions the method vwls presented here outperforms the maximum likelihood and probability weighted moments clearly up to n 100 it also outperforms the l moments method for which the results are equal to pwm and the lh2 moments method as shown in fig 3 for small data sets vwls is better particularly in predicting the probability of the largest and smallest value which are of major interest in e g flood frequency analysis 3 3 estimation by extrapolation the typical use of eva in flood frequency analysis is to extrapolate to a probability lower than those covered by the observed data of extremes for testing our new eva method it would be preferable to compare the methods in extrapolation against the selected cdfs directly this cannot be done by the mean of the simulated values of x m where m refers to a fixed rank because x m p m does not fall on a non linear cdf hence theoretically the best method would be to compare the methods similarly to what was done in section 3 1 i e by fixing a value of x and investigating how well p x will be predicted in the mean however there are two problems with this procedure first extrapolation to a non exceedance probability at a fixed x results in a monte carlo simulation to occasional fits with p 1 this causes a methodological problem in comparing the mean of p x with the p f x from the cdf second there is a practical requirement that in most international regulating codes and standards eva is applied in such way that a return value x p that corresponds to a given probability p is estimated not vice versa this value of x is the basic value in standards such as the eurocode and is therefore of outmost interest in e g engineering design for these reasons we compare here the eva methods in extrapolation by using the variable value x m x p m however as noted above comparisons of the eva methods cannot be done by the mean of x m this issue does not concern the median therefore the median of x is used as the measure of goodness in the following monte carlo simulations were made to see how well the three eva methods estimate the median of the variable value x 30 31 f 1 1 1 31 from fits to samples of size n 15 in other words we extrapolated from each individual fit to the 15 observations obtained in section 3 1 and the median of x 30 31 was calculated these median values are shown in table 4 for the five eva methods next 100 000 sets of 30 samples were generated by a monte carlo simulation from the same selected distributions for the largest values at n 30 the median was also determined and is marked as from the distribution in table 4 table 4 indicates that the vwls method proposed here is quite accurate in estimating the return value of an extrapolated extreme in terms of its median in that regard too the vwls method clearly outperforms the maximum likelihood method for all three types of extreme value distributions table 4 also shows that pwm and l moments perform similarly and lh2 moments slightly worse than them vwls outperforms pwm l and lh2 methods as well this improved accuracy is very important in practical risk analysis 3 4 application example the results of an application of the new method to an extensive analysis of real environmental flood related data are presented in fig 4 here the fifty year return value the annual extreme that is exceeded once in 50 years in the mean of the annual maximum five day precipitation is calculated with both the proposed method on the left and the maximum likelihood method on the right based on 30 years of data of annual extremes such persistent heavy precipitation is a typical situation that precedes flooding events the underlying data are from the e obs european high resolution land only gridded dataset haylock et al 2008 and includes 44 800 samples of 30 annual precipitation values in 1971 2000 in spite of this huge set of data we found no numerical problems when applying the new method the e obs dataset used here is produced through a spatial kriging interpolation of daily station data and computing gridded data at a 0 5 regular latitude longitude grid details of the interpolation methods their implementation and the calculation of uncertainties are given in haylock et al 2008 fig 4 illustrates that our new vwls method provides quite similar results compared to those obtained by the maximum likelihood method fig 4 also indicates that vwls is more sensitive to variations in the data as it appears to provide more small scale details that follow the local topography 3 5 conclusions the vwls method presented here provides estimates for the extremes that are considerably better than obtained by presently available eva methods particularly for small data sets the main advantages of the new method are better prediction of the highest and smallest value in the data set and of extreme events extrapolated to smaller probabilities than covered by the data an additional benefit is that using this method requires no subjective methodological decisions by the user the weaknesses of vwls method include the i i d and the stationarity assumptions these limitations may be removed upon further development and testing in a wider range of distribution parameters the method is best suited for data originating from a single distribution when this is not the case this method can be expanded by a two component approach rulfova et al 2016 the method may be further improved by e g including in the weighing procedure

the fitted gev this can sometimes be seen also in real data for example the amount of snow on the ground for which the limiting value is zero since in eva we are interested in the upper tail of the distribution values at the lower limit are not useful therefore a criterion on how close to the theoretical lower limit the smallest observed extremes are is applied and they are rejected from the analysis accordingly this is explained in detail in the following the smallest extremes are excluded in our analysis i e they are given zero weights if they lay very close to the lower asymptotic limit given by the estimated f Œæ this is done based on the criterion which compares the difference between the smallest and the second smallest Œæ m value Œæ k and Œæ k 1 respectively and the difference between the largest value Œæ n and the smallest value Œæ k if 15 Œæ k 1 Œæ k Œæ n Œæ k b then the smallest observation is eliminated from the analysis and only observations from x k 1 to x n are used in the new iteration process the elimination process continues to the next smallest extreme until the criterion in eq 15 is not met if there are no more than five observations left for the analysis then the data are considered unreliable and rejected here b 0 001 is used in eq 15 2 4 confidence intervals when using this method for each rank confidence intervals can be determined by calculating the quantile of interest from eq 7 these rank intervals can be transferred from the probability scale to the variable scale as an example fig 1 shows a gev distribution that has been fitted to the rank confidence intervals which have been interpolated between each rank and extrapolated here the standard deviation of the m th largest order statistic has been used as a confidence level of interest 3 performance of the vwls method 3 1 evaluation of a fitting method we call our improved eva method described above vwls since it combines minimization of the variance in x v weibull plotting positions w and least squares ls for demonstrating the power of vwls we investigate in the following how well different methods estimate the true cdf of extremes to compare the methods a procedure described in makkonen et al 2013 and pajari et al 2019 is used instead of the conventional comparison of the statistics of the distribution parameters or the quantiles the compelling reasons for this are outlined in the following the distribution parameters Œ≥ Œº and Œ± are non linearly related to p f x therefore there is no reason to believe that e g the bias of the estimated distribution parameters can be used as a measure of a good fit for the distribution itself another way to express this argument is to note that a non linear transformation of an unbiased estimator is biased consequently contrary to the commonly applied intuition good estimates of the distribution parameters do not necessarily imply a good fit of the distribution see pajari et al 2019 we demonstrate the misleading nature of assessing the goodness of fit by the distribution parameters by a simple example in fig 2 the tail of a gumbel distribution with Œº 0 Œ± 1 is shown as the solid line and two estimates for it one with Œº 0 05 Œ± 1 045 blue dashed line and another with Œº 0 1 Œ± 0 95 red dashed line are also shown both parameters Œº and Œ± are closer to the correct values for the blue line nevertheless the red line provides much better estimates for the probability of the extreme values when the distribution includes several parameters three in the case of gev the use of the goodness of the parameters in evaluating the goodness of the fit is even more misleading in such a case the properties of a single parameter do not tell anything of the goodness of fit in terms of e g quantiles and a situation may arise where errors in the parameters cancel out in some range of values but not in others another popular method has been to use the bias or rms error of the quantiles as a measure of goodness of fit however for distributions such as gev also the quantiles are non linearly related to the probability thus e g the bias of a quantile is an inappropriate measure in probabilistic sense pajari et al 2019 accordingly the goodness of fit in the eva methods need to be compared not by the statistics of the parameters Œ≥ Œº Œ± nor the quantiles but by the property for which the cdf estimates are defined i e the probability this can be assessed by considering the frequency of samples falling into equally spaced probability intervals makkonen et al 2013 pajari et al 2019 this is explained in the following assume a variate x and its cumulative distribution function f divide the probability axis in p 1 equal intervals by values i p 1 i 0 p 1 and calculate values x i f 1 i p 1 by definition for an arbitrary observation x the probability of falling to bin x i 1 x i equals 1 p 1 for i 1 p 1 and for all positive integers p hence with increasing number of observations the relative frequency of observations x falling to bin x i 1 x i approaches the probability 1 p 1 this fundamental property can be used when comparing fitting methods the appropriate evaluation method can be outlined by the following steps 1 choose a cdf f x 2 take a sample including n values of x which are x 1 x n in ascending order 3 using this sample and the different fitting methods find the respective estimated cdf f 1 x f 2 x 4 take the next random value x n 1 from the population of x 5 record for each function f j x the bin f j 1 r 1 n 1 f j 1 r n 1 to which x n 1 belongs 6 repeat n times steps 2 5 until the relative frequency n j r n number of x n 1 values falling in bin r divided by n no more changes 7 the goodness of the fitting procedure can now be evaluated using the root squared sum c as 16 c r 1 n 1 n j r n 1 n 1 2 3 2 comparison of eva methods monte carlo simulations with 100 000 rounds to calculate the bin frequency and c were made by fitting the data using the maximum likelihood method fisher 1922 hosking 1985 the probability weighted moments greenwood et al 1979 hosking et al 1985 l moments hosking 1990 hosking and wallis 1997 and lh2 moments wang 1997 as well as the vwls method presented here the random data were produced from gumbel fr√©chet and weibull type distributions for demonstrating the method in case of extreme value distributions the parameters of the distributions were selected so that they represent typical values in environmental data an example of the distribution of samples into the bins in these simulations is shown in fig 3 the results of c for fr√©chet distribution with parameters Œ≥ 0 3 Œ± 10 and Œº 70 are shown in table 1 the columns of the table show c for simulations by different methods the ideal column presents c with respect to the actual distribution in question this value is calculated by replacing the fitted cdf f j x in step 5 by the actual chosen cdf f x similar results for the reversed weibull distribution with parameters Œ≥ 0 3 Œ± 10 and Œº 70 are shown in table 2 and for the gumbel distribution with parameters Œ± 10 and Œº 70 in table 3 however it is noteworthy that for a fixed shape parameter a gev distribution is location scale invariant so that the results are the same as given in tables 1 3 when say Œº 0 and Œ± 1 the results in tables 1 3 show that for data simulated from the three types of extreme value distributions the method vwls presented here outperforms the maximum likelihood and probability weighted moments clearly up to n 100 it also outperforms the l moments method for which the results are equal to pwm and the lh2 moments method as shown in fig 3 for small data sets vwls is better particularly in predicting the probability of the largest and smallest value which are of major interest in e g flood frequency analysis 3 3 estimation by extrapolation the typical use of eva in flood frequency analysis is to extrapolate to a probability lower than those covered by the observed data of extremes for testing our new eva method it would be preferable to compare the methods in extrapolation against the selected cdfs directly this cannot be done by the mean of the simulated values of x m where m refers to a fixed rank because x m p m does not fall on a non linear cdf hence theoretically the best method would be to compare the methods similarly to what was done in section 3 1 i e by fixing a value of x and investigating how well p x will be predicted in the mean however there are two problems with this procedure first extrapolation to a non exceedance probability at a fixed x results in a monte carlo simulation to occasional fits with p 1 this causes a methodological problem in comparing the mean of p x with the p f x from the cdf second there is a practical requirement that in most international regulating codes and standards eva is applied in such way that a return value x p that corresponds to a given probability p is estimated not vice versa this value of x is the basic value in standards such as the eurocode and is therefore of outmost interest in e g engineering design for these reasons we compare here the eva methods in extrapolation by using the variable value x m x p m however as noted above comparisons of the eva methods cannot be done by the mean of x m this issue does not concern the median therefore the median of x is used as the measure of goodness in the following monte carlo simulations were made to see how well the three eva methods estimate the median of the variable value x 30 31 f 1 1 1 31 from fits to samples of size n 15 in other words we extrapolated from each individual fit to the 15 observations obtained in section 3 1 and the median of x 30 31 was calculated these median values are shown in table 4 for the five eva methods next 100 000 sets of 30 samples were generated by a monte carlo simulation from the same selected distributions for the largest values at n 30 the median was also determined and is marked as from the distribution in table 4 table 4 indicates that the vwls method proposed here is quite accurate in estimating the return value of an extrapolated extreme in terms of its median in that regard too the vwls method clearly outperforms the maximum likelihood method for all three types of extreme value distributions table 4 also shows that pwm and l moments perform similarly and lh2 moments slightly worse than them vwls outperforms pwm l and lh2 methods as well this improved accuracy is very important in practical risk analysis 3 4 application example the results of an application of the new method to an extensive analysis of real environmental flood related data are presented in fig 4 here the fifty year return value the annual extreme that is exceeded once in 50 years in the mean of the annual maximum five day precipitation is calculated with both the proposed method on the left and the maximum likelihood method on the right based on 30 years of data of annual extremes such persistent heavy precipitation is a typical situation that precedes flooding events the underlying data are from the e obs european high resolution land only gridded dataset haylock et al 2008 and includes 44 800 samples of 30 annual precipitation values in 1971 2000 in spite of this huge set of data we found no numerical problems when applying the new method the e obs dataset used here is produced through a spatial kriging interpolation of daily station data and computing gridded data at a 0 5 regular latitude longitude grid details of the interpolation methods their implementation and the calculation of uncertainties are given in haylock et al 2008 fig 4 illustrates that our new vwls method provides quite similar results compared to those obtained by the maximum likelihood method fig 4 also indicates that vwls is more sensitive to variations in the data as it appears to provide more small scale details that follow the local topography 3 5 conclusions the vwls method presented here provides estimates for the extremes that are considerably better than obtained by presently available eva methods particularly for small data sets the main advantages of the new method are better prediction of the highest and smallest value in the data set and of extreme events extrapolated to smaller probabilities than covered by the data an additional benefit is that using this method requires no subjective methodological decisions by the user the weaknesses of vwls method include the i i d and the stationarity assumptions these limitations may be removed upon further development and testing in a wider range of distribution parameters the method is best suited for data originating from a single distribution when this is not the case this method can be expanded by a two component approach rulfova et al 2016 the method may be further improved by e g including in the weighing procedure

8624,biophysical agricultural models are needed for assessing science based mitigation options to improve the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural cropping systems it is crucial that they can accurately simulate soil hydrology and nutrient flows which strongly influence crop growth biogeochemical processes and water quality the purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the denitrification decomposition model dndc which utilizes simplified hydrologic processes to a more comprehensive water flow model the root zone water quality model rzwqm2 to determine which processes are sufficient for simulating water and nitrogen dynamics and recommend improvements both models were calibrated and validated for simulating soil hydrology nitrogen loss to tile drains and crop biomass using detailed observations from a corn zea mays l soybean glycine max l merr rotation in iowa with and without cover crops dndc performed adequately across a wide range of metrics in comparison to a more hydrologically complex model soybean and corn yield and corn biomass over the growing season were well simulated by both models nrmse 25 soybean yields were also very well simulated by both models nrmse 20 however soybean biomass was over predicted by rzwqm2 in the validation treatments the magnitude of winter rye biomass and n uptake was well simulated but the timing of growth initiation in the spring was inaccurate at times the annual and monthly estimation of tile flow and nitrogen loss to tiles drains were well simulated by both models however rzwqm2 performed better for simulating soil water content and the dynamics of daily water flow to tile drains dndc nse 0 32 to 0 24 rzwqm2 nse 0 35 0 69 dndc overestimated soil water content near the soil surface and underestimated it in the deeper profile we recommend that developments be carried out for dndc to include improved root density and penetration functions a heterogeneous and deeper soil profile a fluctuating water table and mechanistic tile drainage however the inclusion of computationally intensive processes needs to be assessed in context to improved accuracy weighed against the model s broad applicability keywords dndc rzwqm2 tile drain soil hydrology water quality crop biomass 1 introduction the performance of beneficial management practices for reducing nutrient losses from agricultural systems can vary both temporally and spatially in response to climate variations and soil diversity in the landscape process based agricultural models can be valuable tools for extrapolating impacts of management over space and time it is well known that many of the connected crop soil atmospheric processes are strongly influenced by water and thus the performance of these models is highly correlated with how these hydrological processes are defined most models are developed to quantify a specific outcome such as crop biomass greenhouse gas emissions soil carbon change or water quality and as a result the ability of the model to simulate hydrology is often simplified the design philosophy that developers often choose is one which leans towards utilizing more simplified processes in order to keep the user expertise input requirements model transparency and computation time manageable it is important for modellers to understand the limitations imposed by the hydrological modelling framework such that informed decisions can be made regarding the range of applicability and outcome quality the dndc model is one of the most widely used process based models for agriculture and is arguably the most sophisticated for estimating greenhouse gas emissions however the model simulates simple cascade water flow and does not include a mechanistic drainage sub model in a recent review of c n models dndc was found to be the only model which estimated all c n related ghg emissions considered brilli et al 2017 however the model demonstrated weaknesses in simulating soil hydrology and the overall water budget and requires improvement he et al 2018 brilli et al 2017 congreves et al 2016 dutta et al 2016 uzoma et al 2015 smith et al 2008 cui et al 2014 abdalla et al 2011 deng et al 2011 dndc has been employed to estimate water drainage and no3 n loading in the u s gopalakrishnan et al 2012 david et al 2009 tonitto et al 2007a b 2010 li et al 2006 and china li et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 and once calibrated the model generally performed well however the model was not tested systematically for simulating crop biomass soil water content and daily water flow in these studies recent studies have shown that dndc outperformed other water budget models guest et al 2018 largely because it includes a crop growth sub model which integrates daily crop growth water nitrogen and heat stresses dndc performed similarly to cascade models daycent and stics for simulating soil water content but performed better for simulating soil n particularly over stics which at the time did not include a soil freeze thaw sub model stics overestimated n loss in the late fall but snow insulation and freeze thaw have now been incorporated summer 2018 dndc has not been benchmarked against a computational based water quality model for assessing full system water and n dynamics the usda ars root zone water quality model rzwqm2 ma et al 2012 is a detailed hydrologic model for simulating biogeochemical processes in the root zone the model released in 1992 includes design features and concepts from several other root zone models the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat hoogenboom et al 2017 crop model is also embedded in its code the benefit of using dssat is that it is widely used for simulating crop growth and phenology worldwide the rzwqm2 model simulates a wide range of soil plant atmospheric processes and includes much more detailed hydrologic processes than dndc including the green ampt equation for infiltration richard s equation for water flow and hooghoudt s equation for tile drainage several studies have shown that rzwqm2 can be employed successfully for simulating water flow to tile drains xian et al 2017 ma et al 2012 qi et al 2011b akhand et al 2003 kanwar et al 1997 there have previously been successful comparisons of crop models which use simpler hydrology to computational models malone et al 2017 but such assessments are rare particularly across a wide range of metrics at high temporal resolution in order to properly understand and quantify model performance detailed input data and a wide array of observations for benchmarking water soil and crop related processes are crucial in this paper we use a comprehensive dataset that includes measurements of corn and soybean yields common crops grown in the midwestern u s corn soybean and winter rye biomass crop n uptake continuous soil water content at multiple depths and near continuous estimates of water flow and n loading to tile drains across multiple years qi et al 2011a b ma et al 2012 the objectives of this study were to i calibrate and validate the dndc and rzwqm2 models for simulating crop growth soil water flow and nitrogen loading to tile drains in cropping systems with and without cover crops ii compare the performance of the models for simulating crop growth soil hydrology and water quality and iii document the strengths and weaknesses of the models for simulating water flow and n loss to tile drains and recommend future developments in doing so we compare the performance of simpler water processes in dndc which are in fact common in many agricultural models to the more detailed hydrology based model rzwqm2 in an effort to discern what level of process complexity is necessary for simulating water quality at daily monthly and annual scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 field studies the model comparison was performed using measurements of water flow n loss to tile drains and biomass data from a corn soybean study with and without cover crops at the agricultural drainage water quality research and demonstration site near gilmore city in pocahontas county north central iowa 42 42 n 104 00 w lawlor et al 2008 qi et al 2011a b qi and helmers 2010 the general soil texture classification of the site is a fine loamy or fine clay loam and included 4 soil classifications nicollet webster canisteo and okoboji usda 1985 the average particle size distribution across the 16 plots used in our analysis was 33 sand 35 silt and 32 clay and the bulk density was 1 34 g cm 3 the average annual jan 1st to dec 31st temperature was 8 c and annual precipitation was 821 mm as part of a larger study 16 hydrologically distinct plots 15 38 m long of completely randomized block design were established in the fall of 2004 and lasted 5 years until 2009 the study consisted of two treatments with cover crops and two controls each with 4 reps treatment 1 trt1 consisted of winter rye prior to corn in odd years and prior to soybean in even years whereas treatment 2 trt2 was the reverse phase with winter rye prior to soybean in odd years and prior to corn in even years table 1 the controls ctrl1 and ctrl2 included the same cropping system but with no winter rye cover crop rye secale cereale brand name rymin glyphosate resistant corn dekalb 50 45 77 000 seed ha 1 and soybean pioneer 92 m40 group 2 middle season 439 750 seed ha 1 were planted using a drill seeder with dates determined by field conditions but at the same dates for control and no control treatments the agronomic practices for tillage and fertilizer application were consistent with those usually employed in iowa and the scheduling of events is shown in table 1 aqueous ammonia fertilizer at a rate of 140 kg n ha 1 was applied on corn shortly after emergence and no fertilizer was applied to the soybean or winter rye the gilmore city site included a large complement of measurements such as water content at 4 depths biomass and crop n uptake and daily time step measurements of water flow and n concentration to tile drains tile drains were 106 cm deep 7 6 cm diameter and drain spacing was 7 6 m for details regarding sampling techniques see qi and helmers 2010 and lawlor et al 2008 2 2 model overview as discussed in the following sections the dndc model employs simple equations and methods for soil hydrology whereas rzwqm2 which was primarily developed for simulating water quality thus includes much more mechanistic and computation intensive equations table 2 fig 1 an earlier version 2 0 2010 of the rzwqm2 was previously calibrated and validated for the gilmore city site qi et al 2011b but in this study a newer version 3 0 2015 was employed in a similar manner using calibration and validation procedures described in ma et al 2012 once calibrated the newer version performed similarly with marginally improved results 2 2 1 dndc the denitrification decomposition dndc model li et al 2012 is a widely used process based model for simulating the effects of climate and agricultural management on crop growth soil c n cycling trace gas emissions and nutrient loss from runoff and drainage it includes several sub models for predicting crop growth soil climate decomposition nitrification denitrification and fermentation the model was first developed to estimate nitrous oxide emissions but was later expanded to estimate soil c n cycling water drainage and nitrogen loss to tile drains li et al 2006 and finally to include full farm facility and livestock systems li et al 2012 the model has been tested and validated extensively for simulating crop growth ghg emissions soil carbon change and ammonia volatilization worldwide ehrhardt et al 2018 brilli et al 2017 zhang and niu 2016 gilhespy et al 2014 but it has seldom been tested for simulating water flow and nutrient losses to tile drains efforts are made by the model developers to minimize the amount of input data and process time required thus some of the processes in dndc are purposefully kept simple the current release version of dndc employs a cascade flow water model simulating bulk water flux and n transport through the profile table 2 fig 1 li et al 2006 included a deep water pool to increase the default 50 cm soil profile depth to that of a tile drain however the deep water pool depth can t be adjusted without recompiling the model n adsorption and transformations are not included in the additional profile and a fluctuating water table is not simulated adsorption and desorption of nh4 based on the langmuir equation was also incorporated in his study top 50 cm of soil profile as well as a simplistic empirical relationship or recession curve to delay drainage by soil layer this recession curve required parameterization of coefficients for each soil type tonitto et al 2007a and is no longer active in the current release version tonitto et al 2007a found that after calibration of the recession equation in dndc the model performance was satisfactory for simulating annual water flow and nitrate loss to tile drains when aggregated across a watershed however dndc consistently under predicted monthly drainage and the model was not tested using daily data several modelling teams have developed specific versions of the model to better enable the simulation of regional soils climate events crop cultivars and management practices in our study a canadian version of dndc dndcv can was employed which is well suited for over winter conditions that occur in iowa this version was developed over the last several years by introducing crop specific growth curves for wheat corn and soybean grant et al 2016 by improving the prediction of evapotranspiration et dutta et al 2016 by adding a new ammonia sub model for simulating manure slurry additions congreves et al 2016 and urea fertilizer the model was also revised for simulating the effects of biomass crop residue snow cover and soil texture on soil temperature dutta et al 2018 at the beginning of this study all developments for canada dndc were added to the u s release version thus creating an up to date model version which includes both the u s and canadian developments available at https github com brianbgrant dndcv can 2 2 2 rzwqm2 the root zone water quality model version 3 0 2015 ma et al 2012 was developed to simulate major biogeochemical processes in agricultural systems that affect water quality in the plant root zone and below the root zone runoff and to tile drains the model is largely one dimensional but includes quasi two dimensional lateral flow to tile drains similar to dndc the model simulates a wide range of agricultural management practices but it includes more detailed processes for simulating water and nutrient transport including mechanistic tile drainage table 2 fig 1 rzwqm2 includes dssat 4 0 cropping system models jones et al 2003 with ceres and cropgro components ma et al 2005 2006 and thus can simulate crop growth and development for a wide range of crops using an established and verified framework rzwqm2 is more data intensive than dndc requiring a more detailed physical representation of the soil profile it requires parameters for describing soil water retention and other hydraulic properties it also requires more intensive computer processing time since it simulates a heterogeneous soil profile and includes mechanistic equations such as numerical procedures for solving the richard s equation and green ampt infiltration table 2 fig 1 our hypothesis is that rzwqm2 should be more accurate than dndc in predicting water flow and nutrient loading but will require more data to initialize and calibrate 2 3 model initialization calibration and validation for each research location treatment 1 includes a winter rye cover crop was used to calibrate the models whereas treatment 2 and the controls were used to validate the models calibration was conducted by trial and error towards minimalizing rmse for yield biomass drainage and n loss to tiles model simulations were run for a ten year spin up period prior to the beginning of the experiment to stabilize water and n pools in the models soil inputs including percent sand silt and clay bulk density soil c content field capacity and wilting point were available from measurements taken at the site across several depths table s1 soil properties were not measured below 120 cm thus the values from the 90 120 cm depth were assumed to apply below 120 cm soil properties were similar between plots and initial tests with both models indicated little influence on modelled water dynamics thus the same properties were used for all treatments and controls similar to qi et al 2011b 2 3 1 rzwqm2 calibration detailed soil properties were input for each measured depth increment table s1 the initial carbon and nitrogen residues in the soil profile were determined from thorp et al 2007 including crop residue and microbial pools initial soil moisture was set based on sampling in november 2005 with saturation occurring below 60 cm depth to initiate the simulation of a water table in the model the soil depth above the impermeable layer was set to 390 cm and a ksat rate of 0 01 cm h 1 was set in the bottom layer to limit flow and maintain the water table the lateral saturated conductivity used in the hooghoudt equation for each soil layer was set to 2ksat brookes corey is a four parameter nonlinear curve fitting model for fitting water retention data two of these parameters saturated and residual water contents were based on one third bar measurements the other two parameters are used for curve fitting the 2nd exponent of k curve n2 was calculated as 3Œª 2 and the 2nd intercept c2 was estimated as ksat pb n2 where Œª is the pore size distribution index and pb is the bubbling pressure cm the background n in precipitation was set to 0 5 mg n l 1 and 1 3 mg n l 1 for nh4 and no3 respectively qi et al 2011b agriculture management practices including planting and harvest dates tillage type and scheduling fertilizer rates and scheduling were also used as inputs table 1 most of the dssat crop parameters for the corn ib 1068 dekalb 521 and soybean 990002 m group 2 were left as default table s2 however a few were modified to minimize nrmse of yield in the calibration treatment trt1 for corn three crop parameters were adjusted the maximum possible number of kernels per plant g2 and the kernel filling rate during linear grain filling stage g3 mg d 1 were decreased to 722 and 6 55 respectively the phylochron interval between successive leaf tip appearance phint c days was increased to 46 for soybean only maximum leaf photosynthesis rate at 30c 350vpm and high light lfmax umol co2 m 2 s 1 was modified lowering it from 1 03 to 0 80 the parameters of the winter rye crop were based on a u s winter wheat crop cultivar 990003 winter us since a winter rye cultivar was not available in the dssat database significant calibration was required with most of the calibration performed in qi et al 2011b in this study we further adjusted four parameters to minimize nrmse for biomass in trt1 table s2 phylochron interval time between successive leaf appearance phint was increased to 100 conversion rate from photosynthetically active radiation to dry mater before the end of leaf growth paruv g mj 1 was increased to 3 3 lamina area to weight ratio of standard first leaf larws cm2 g 1 was increased to 300 and finally lamina area to weight ratio phase 2 lawr2 cm2 g 1 was increased to 280 phint was adjusted to delay growth in the spring and the remaining three parameters were adjusted to increase growth rate before calibration rzwqm2 simulated average annual mineralization rates that were lower than expected 100 kg n ha 1y 1 which resulted in low rates of n loss to tile drains carpenter boggs et al 2000 found that average mineralization rates were 142 kg n ha 1 for a 189 day growing season for a corn soybean rotation in eastern south dakota clay loam soil at 1 8 soil c rzwqm2 was calibrated by increasing the decay rates of the organic matter pools by 38 which in turn resulted in an acceptable rate of n loss to tile drains nare 3 5 nse 0 92 and level of crop n uptake nare 6 4 nrmse 17 total organic n in the soil profile remained stable within 0 5 of the starting value over the five year study 2 3 2 dndc calibration the dndc model was less time consuming to calibrate largely because it employs less intensive hydrologic processes and equations with fewer parameters the processing time for a simulation was 12 times faster only the soil physical and chemical properties for the top soil layer are required as input table s1 these properties include bulk density soil texture clay fraction field capacity at 0 33 bar wilting point at 15 bar ph ksat porosity soil organic carbon the model employs a pedo transfer function to estimate a decline in soil carbon and an increase in bulk density down the soil profile this may result in an erroneous approximation of the soil profile the n concentration in precipitation was set to be 1 8 mg n l 1 to be equivalent to the total value used in rzwqm2 this resulted in an average annual atmospheric n input of 14 1 kg n ha 1y 1 dndc uses the scs runoff curve number method developed by the usda natural resources conservation service and also the modified universal soil loss equation musle which includes the manning s coefficient for overland flow for runoff the scs curve number was set to 64 for a well drained row crop with residue and clay loam soil and the manning s roughness coefficient was set to 0 19 for conventional tillage with residue the option was employed to use all climate drivers on a daily time step maximum and minimum temperature precipitation wind speed radiation and relative humidity dndc requires similar agricultural management inputs as rzwqm2 table 1 the crop parameters in dndc are simpler and less varied however they often require substantial modification since values are generalized for specific crop types and are not provided for cultivars the user inputs are easily understood and include inputs such as max biomass production of grain biomass fractions of plant organs c n ratios of plant organs thermal degree days to maturity water demand g water g dry matter and optimum temperature for growth other crop parameters are internal per crop type and cannot be modified without recompiling the model such as minimum and maximum temperature for growth effect of atmospheric co2 on assimilation effect of co2 on water and n use efficiency and temperature stress during anthesis in this study we modified the default parameters for corn soybean and winter wheat to minimize nrmse for yield the thermal degree days to maturity tdd for soybean was set to 2500 the crop water demand was increased from 350 to 420 g water g dry matter and max potential biomass of grain was set to 2550 kg c ha 1y 1 for corn the max biomass of grain was set to 4500 kg c ha 1y 1 and the c n ratios of grain leaf and root were modified from 50 80 80 to 35 70 70 respectively to increase and improve n uptake relative to average measured values and resulting n stress affecting corn yields biomass the default rye crop in dndc was adjusted to improve the simulation of winter rye biomass relative to the control by lowering the tdd from 2000 to 1400 and lowering the optimum temperature for growth from 25 to 18 c similar to rzwqm2 the default soc partitioning som pool sizes and decay rates resulted in too little n mineralization and under prediction of n in tile drains the humus fraction was lowered from 0 8 to 0 7 after calibration the average annual mineralization over the five year study was simulated to be 169 kg n ha 1y 1 in rzwqm2 whereas it was 170 kg n ha 1y 1 in dndc 2 4 statistical measures for testing model performance the following statistical measures were used to evaluate model accuracy in predicting crop yields biomass and crop n pearson s r correlation coefficient r normalized average relative error nare and normalized root mean square error nrmse the nare value represents the percent over or under prediction of a model relative to measurements it is similar to percent bias pbias but of opposite sign 1 r

is the observed value the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse was applied for evaluating model performance in simulating soil hydrology and nitrate fluxes to tile drains a value of 0 for nse maximum possible value is 1 indicates the model estimates are more accurate than the average of observations ahuja et al 2000 considered model performance was satisfactory for yields and biomass if nare 15 and jamieson et al 1991 considered excellent performance if rsme 10 good 20 fair 30 and poor 30 moriasi et al 2007 suggested that model performance for simulating water and n flow was satisfactory if nse 0 5 water flow if nare 25 and n loss if nare 70 3 results and discussion the gilmore city dataset offers a large range of biomass soil water storage n and water flow measurements from daily to annual scales which was systematically used to assess model performance and potential areas for improving hydrological processes in the following sections 3 1 crop yield and growth accurate simulation of crop growth including the impacts of temperature water and nutrient stresses on production is crucial for simulating water and n dynamics in agricultural models recently guest et al 2018 reported that dndcv can outperformed two water budget models that do not simulate crop growth in this study both dndc and rzwqm2 performed well in simulating corn and soybean yields table 3 fig s3a rzwqm2 performed a little better than dndc for corn across the three validation treatments but for both models nare was 4 and nrmse was 11 soybean yields were slightly overestimated by both models 8 nare and the nrmse was higher than for corn but simulations were still considered to be good higher relative nrmse may be expected when simulating lower yields rzwqm2 tested in this study performed marginally better lower nare and nrmse for both corn and soybean yields than did the 2010 version which was previously used to simulate the same cropping system qi et al 2011b the rmse values for both dndc and rzwqm2 in this study were lower for corn than in jarecki et al 2018 who estimated rmse s of over 1100 kg dm ha 1 using dndcv can the nrmse for both models was however higher than estimated by he et al 2018 using dndcv can who calculated values from 4 0 to 6 1 for corn and 6 4 11 8 for soybean but in each case the validation simulations were performed over only 2 years of data corn and soybean biomass over the growing season for the calibration treatment was predicted with good model performance by both rzwqm2 and dndc table 4 fig 2 note however that dndc does not simulate soybean senescence which is a model weakness likely resulting in an overestimation of the last biomass observation in 2008 fig 2 dndc also does not simulate water excess on crop growth as was pointed out in sansoulet et al 2014 but since this was a well drained site there was likely little influence corn biomass was predicted with good performance by both models across all validation treatments with a little better performance by dndc in trt2 and ctrl2 corn in 2006 and 2008 soybean biomass was predicted with good performance by both models for ctrl1 observed soybean biomass was low in trt2 and ctrl2 in 2007 and 2009 and dndc captured this reasonably well fig 2 however rzwqm2 over predicted biomass throughout most of the season note that simulated biomass decreased in rzwqm2 at the end of the season during senescence and the prediction of soybean yield for the validation treatments was good table 3 the models over predicted biomass more so in trt2 fig 2 when observed soybean growth appeared to be suppressed by low seasonal growing degree days gdd fig s1 the models were calibrated for soybean growth only in 2006 and 2008 when gdd was higher the cumulative seasonal winter rye biomass and n uptake was predicted quite well by both models with are always being 20 however the timing of growth and n uptake was sometimes off resulting in high nrmse table 5 fig s2 the high nrmse was in part due to the low biomass and n uptake but there was also difficulty in simulating the correct timing of emergence in spring in rzwqm2 a winter wheat cultivar was adjusted to simulate winter rye as no existing cultivar was available and in dndc a generalized rye crop was adjusted to simulate winter rye this suggests room for future improvement 3 2 soil hydrology an analysis of water partitioning fig 3 indicated that both models predicted similar levels of annual drainage runoff and et with greater transpiration occurring in the years with cover crop particularly for rzwqm2 which simulated on average 29 2 mm transpiration from winter rye in comparison to 19 2 mm for dndc it is interesting that the dndc model which employs a simple cascade water flow approach predicted similar water balances as rzwqm2 particularly for treatments with no cover crop there has however been considerable efforts recently to improve estimates of et and adjust crop coefficients using the penman monteith approach dutta et al 2016 et is the largest component of water loss from the agroecosystem in this study and likely has a large influence on how much water is transported down the soil profile rzwqm2 performed much better than did dndc for simulating soil water storage in the 0 60 cm soil profile fig 4 table s3 and soil water content by layer fig s4 since dndc only simulates water to effectively 100 cm depth and plant roots don t have access to the water table soil water content during the warmer summer months were greatly underestimated in an attempt to meet crop demands the inclusion of mechanistic tile drainage allowing for simulation of a water table would likely greatly improve water content simulation during the warmer periods soil water content was generally overestimated by dndc near the soil surface and underestimated deeper in the profile which was presumably caused by the lack of root distribution algorithms the inability to simulate a heterogeneous soil profile and no water table the dndc model currently does not estimate changes in root density in the soil profile and plants uptake water equally across the top 50 cm it is expected that the inclusion of simple root density functions by crop type such as those described by pedersen et al 2010 could further improve water uptake and the distribution of water down the profile note that dndc currently only outputs soil water that is not frozen so the winter period is not shown as reported in a recent review of c n models brilli et al 2017 and from other sources he et al 2018 dutta et al 2016 uzoma et al 2015 abdalla et al 2011 deng et al 2011 smith et al 2008 saggar et al 2004 dndc was found to have weaknesses in simulating soil water content and in many of these studies the lack of the ability to simulate a heterogeneous soil profile was noted 3 3 water flow and n loss to tile drains the success of a model in simulating soil water and n dynamics is relevant to different time scales determined by the criteria set forth in a study time scales of interest may include those over the growing season to estimate water and n dynamics for overall crop requirements or a shorter time frame may need to be considered to assess water and n during critical phases of growth further it may be important to estimate n and p loss to drains and to runoff on a monthly basis in order to assess the risk of eutrophication in water bodies on a daily basis soil water and n status is important for estimating several processes including n2o emissions from denitrification which can be driven by individual rainfall events verg√© et al 2017 found that the grey water footprint of corn production varied greatly across time scales with the greatest footprint of 2700 mm water daily to zero annually thus in this study we assess water flow to tile drains at three different time steps daily monthly and annually nitrogen loss to tile drains is assessed monthly and annually since n concentration in bulk water samples was measured only when water attained a certain depth in the collecting reservoir generally 1 2 weeks 3 3 1 water flow to tile drains the dndc model performed well for simulating water loss to tile drains on an annual basis from 2005 to 2009 with similar statistics to rzwqm2 table 6 fig s3b on average across the three validation treatments nse 0 76 was very similar between the models rzwqm2 performed better for ctrl1 and trt2 however dndc performed better for ctrl2 likewise both models performed well for simulating monthly water flow to tiles with remarkably similar statistics in all cases nse was 0 5 however both models under predicted water flow for trt2 and over predicted it for ctrl2 this could be attributed to variability in measurements since the standard error calculated from the 4 plot replicates was sometimes high particularly in 2007 and 2008 when flow to drains was highest fig s5 measurement variability was not accounted for in the statistics and the observations showed more overall water to tile drains in trt2 with cover crop than in ctrl2 without cover crop which is unlikely both models predicted slightly more water loss to tile drains due to less transpiration when there was no cover crop there was a simulated trade off between evaporation and transpiration but the cover crop was still predicted to reduce subsurface drainage volume which is consistent with some experimental studies strock et al 2004 qi and helmers 2010 a number of studies showed no effect of cover crop on subsurface water drainage volume drury et al 2014 qi et al 2011a qi et al 2008 kaspar et al 2007 this could be due to the trade off between reduced evaporation and increased transpiration when a cover crop was added in rotation and or measurement variability masking a small influence in a study by david et al 2009 6 models swat daycent epic drainmod n ii and two versions of dndc 82a and 82 h were compared for simulating aggregated water and nitrate flux to tile drains it was found that all models except dndc82h performed well in simulating monthly water flux nse 0 5 but the models which were designed to simulate tile drainage swat epic and drainmod n demonstrated better performance nse 0 68 all of the models investigated included a cascade flow approach to simulatie drainage at this time the dndc model versions tested included a thornwaite approach which sometimes greatly overestimate et thus it is not surprising that dndc82h underestimated water loss to drains by 33 in our current study dndc includes the penman monteith approach with crop specific coefficients for et dutta et al 2016 and the nse for monthly flow to tiles was above 0 6 for all treatments it is very important to simulate an appropriate level of et since it is usually the largest component of water loss the hermes model which includes cascade water flow was previously used to simulate water and n loss to tile drains in a similar cropping system as used in our current study and it was found that once calibrated the model could simulate the lower n loss that occurred when cover crops were included in a corn soybean cropping system with a reasonable degree of accuracy the hermes model was compared to rzwqm2 which was used to simulate the same cropping system in a previous study li et al 2008 it was found that hermes did not simulate the year to year variability in nitrate concentration nor the monthly drainage as well as did rzwqm2 drainage was over predicted in the september through december 2003 2005 period likely because hermes did not include the reduced evaporation from residue cover in our current study dndc does include this impact and simulations of monthly water and n loss to drains were similar to rzwqm2 both rzwqm2 and dndc also include snow dynamics which hermes did not and soil freeze thaw processes late season drainage can be greatly overestimated without these processes which was the case for stics in comparison to dndc and daycent in guest et al 2017 rzwqm2 performed substantially better than dndc for simulating daily water flow table 6 the dndc model tended to capture the start time of flow events but flow occurred too rapidly with over prediction near the start of the event and under prediction near the end an example of this trend is shown in fig 5 for ctrl2 and the full comparison for 2007 and 2008 the years in which daily water flow was available qi et al 2011b is shown in fig s6 this phenomenon can be expected from a cascade flow model which employs a bulk flux method for n and water movement and does not consider delays in drainage it is important that the timing of these events are simulated correctly since soil water and oxygen content are critical drivers for denitrification and even short term erroneous predictions can greatly influence nitrous oxide emissions uzoma et al 2015 a previous version of dndc dndc87 included a recession curve to retain water in each layer slowing drainage based on an empirical equation driven by clay content this algorithm was developed by li et al 2006 and employed by tonitto et al 2007a b 2010 we investigated re enabling this routine in dndc on a test basis and found that after parameterizing the recession curve for the calibration treatment the daily water flow was similar to rzwqm2 and statistics for the validation treatments were greatly improved to be as good as rzwqm2 however soil water content was greatly over predicted nare 21 8 resulting in exaggerated rates of denitrification and n2o emissions were increased by 26 thus we do not recommend using this approach and it is not employed in the current u s dndc release version 3 3 2 nitrogen loading to tile drains both models performed satisfactorily in estimating n loss to tiles on an annual basis table 7 fig s3c with similar average statistics across the validation treatments nse 0 72 and 0 65 for dndc and rzwqm2 respectively the models generally performed satisfactorily in simulating no3 n loss to tile drains on a monthly basis however dndc performed a little better with acceptable statistics for ctrl2 table 7 fig 6 david et al 2009 when comparing the performance of 6 models found that two different versions of dndc predicted n loss to tiles within 10 but the monthly timing of n loss was relatively poorly simulated with nse 0 4 which is considerably less than in our current study table 7 for all six models investigated david et al 2009 indicated that inaccuracy in predicting the variation in monthly water flux resulted in inaccuracies in predicting n losses two of the three models which included tile drainage simulation performed better swat and drainmod n ii with nse 0 5 in our study both dndc and rzwqm2 agreed in estimating the magnitude of n loss to tile drains however similar to water flow to tile drains both models underestimated loss in trt2 and overestimated loss in ctrl2 table 7 fig s7 the observed and simulated cumulative water flow and n loss to tile drains on average across the 4 treatments was indeed very similar between the models and observations fig s8 the over and under predictions may be due to measurement variability amongst plots especially when one considers that observations had greater average annual n loss in trt2 39 9 kg ha 1 y 1 than in ctrl2 33 7 kg ha 1 y 1 this result seems unlikely considering that we generally expect less n loss to drains when a cover crop is included which was the case for trt1 34 4 kg ha 1 y 1 and ctrl1 41 0 kg ha 1 y 1 both models consistently estimated less n loss to tile drains when a cover crop was included in rotation which is a common finding in a number of experimental studies malone et al 2017 drury et al 2014 li et al 2008 kaspar et al 2007 parkin et al 2006 strock et al 2004 logsdon et al 2002 qi et al 2008 2011c did not find any difference in n loading when a cover crop was included in the study we simulated this was likely because the winter during the 5 year experimental period was colder than usual leading to low winter rye biomass in long term simulations over 40 years an 11 reduction of n loading was reported qi et al 2011b the observed rates of loss were generally high with an annual average loss of 37 3 kg no3 n ha 1 y 1 across all treatments it may be expected that no3 n leaching is high in a well drained soil with subsurface drainage but runoff of phosphorous sediment nh4 n and no3 n is generally low lawlor et al 2008 in this study there were no observations available for runoff but both models predicted minimal no3 n runoff 1 kg n ha 1y 1 for all years and treatments which was expected for this site 4 conclusions it is important to continue to scrutinize and compare agriculture models against high quality datasets to identify differences in model structure that result in improved performance sometimes during model development there are options to include more complex processes and model structure however a developer may purposefully keep the inputs and complexity manageable in order to minimize input requirements and reduce the level of required modeler expertise in this study we compare the performance of two widely used process based models for simulating crop growth and soil water dynamics and no3 n loss to tile drains the conceptual design of each of these models was focused on different objectives the dndc model was mostly developed and employed for simulating ghg emissions and soil carbon change whereas rzwqm2 focused primarily on crop growth and water quality it was informative to discover that a simple cascade water sub model dndc performed adequately in comparison to measurements and similarly with respect to rzwqm2 across a wide range of metrics including crop yield biomass n uptake of winter rye annual and monthly water flow and no3 n loss to tile drains the penman monteith method for estimating et in dndc recently improved by dutta et al 2016 was a strong factor in estimating the appropriate water balance particularly since et was estimated to be a large percent of the water budget it was interesting to find that bulk gravity drainage regulated by cascade water flow through a homogeneous soil profile was effective in simulating water flow on an annual and monthly basis but not on a daily basis if this scale of resolution is deemed appropriate for the study objective then no further detail in hydrologic processes may be needed estimates from dndc did reveal shortcomings in simulating soil water storage soil water contents down the profile and daily water flow events whereas rzwqm2 generally performed adequately for these metrics fine scale temporal simulation of water and n dynamics can greatly impact soil water and nutrient levels thereby influencing several biogeochemical processes such as decomposition denitrification nitrification and methanogenisis these processes are largely dependent on soil water content since dndc is primarily used to simulate ghg emissions we recommend that developments be carried out for dndc to further improve its hydrological processes such changes may include a deeper and heterogeneous soil profile inclusion of root distribution functions inclusion of improved water flow a fluctuating water table and or a mechanistic drainage sub model a mechanistic tile drainage sub model could also enable the simulation of the impacts of drainage depth and spacing controlled drainage and irrigation on nutrient cycling and ghg emissions which would greatly increase the usefulness of an already widely used model considerations should however be taken when contemplating model developments more complex processes can increase model input requirements inputs which may not be available especially in regional large scale studies pedo transfer functions are sometimes used to estimating soil water inputs for models but they also come with a degree of uncertainty most of the suggested additions for dndc likely would not greatly increase model input requirements or simulation time however it remains questionable whether or not to include a computationally intensive water flow approach i e the richards equation conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest appendix a supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found

8624,biophysical agricultural models are needed for assessing science based mitigation options to improve the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural cropping systems it is crucial that they can accurately simulate soil hydrology and nutrient flows which strongly influence crop growth biogeochemical processes and water quality the purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the denitrification decomposition model dndc which utilizes simplified hydrologic processes to a more comprehensive water flow model the root zone water quality model rzwqm2 to determine which processes are sufficient for simulating water and nitrogen dynamics and recommend improvements both models were calibrated and validated for simulating soil hydrology nitrogen loss to tile drains and crop biomass using detailed observations from a corn zea mays l soybean glycine max l merr rotation in iowa with and without cover crops dndc performed adequately across a wide range of metrics in comparison to a more hydrologically complex model soybean and corn yield and corn biomass over the growing season were well simulated by both models nrmse 25 soybean yields were also very well simulated by both models nrmse 20 however soybean biomass was over predicted by rzwqm2 in the validation treatments the magnitude of winter rye biomass and n uptake was well simulated but the timing of growth initiation in the spring was inaccurate at times the annual and monthly estimation of tile flow and nitrogen loss to tiles drains were well simulated by both models however rzwqm2 performed better for simulating soil water content and the dynamics of daily water flow to tile drains dndc nse 0 32 to 0 24 rzwqm2 nse 0 35 0 69 dndc overestimated soil water content near the soil surface and underestimated it in the deeper profile we recommend that developments be carried out for dndc to include improved root density and penetration functions a heterogeneous and deeper soil profile a fluctuating water table and mechanistic tile drainage however the inclusion of computationally intensive processes needs to be assessed in context to improved accuracy weighed against the model s broad applicability keywords dndc rzwqm2 tile drain soil hydrology water quality crop biomass 1 introduction the performance of beneficial management practices for reducing nutrient losses from agricultural systems can vary both temporally and spatially in response to climate variations and soil diversity in the landscape process based agricultural models can be valuable tools for extrapolating impacts of management over space and time it is well known that many of the connected crop soil atmospheric processes are strongly influenced by water and thus the performance of these models is highly correlated with how these hydrological processes are defined most models are developed to quantify a specific outcome such as crop biomass greenhouse gas emissions soil carbon change or water quality and as a result the ability of the model to simulate hydrology is often simplified the design philosophy that developers often choose is one which leans towards utilizing more simplified processes in order to keep the user expertise input requirements model transparency and computation time manageable it is important for modellers to understand the limitations imposed by the hydrological modelling framework such that informed decisions can be made regarding the range of applicability and outcome quality the dndc model is one of the most widely used process based models for agriculture and is arguably the most sophisticated for estimating greenhouse gas emissions however the model simulates simple cascade water flow and does not include a mechanistic drainage sub model in a recent review of c n models dndc was found to be the only model which estimated all c n related ghg emissions considered brilli et al 2017 however the model demonstrated weaknesses in simulating soil hydrology and the overall water budget and requires improvement he et al 2018 brilli et al 2017 congreves et al 2016 dutta et al 2016 uzoma et al 2015 smith et al 2008 cui et al 2014 abdalla et al 2011 deng et al 2011 dndc has been employed to estimate water drainage and no3 n loading in the u s gopalakrishnan et al 2012 david et al 2009 tonitto et al 2007a b 2010 li et al 2006 and china li et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 and once calibrated the model generally performed well however the model was not tested systematically for simulating crop biomass soil water content and daily water flow in these studies recent studies have shown that dndc outperformed other water budget models guest et al 2018 largely because it includes a crop growth sub model which integrates daily crop growth water nitrogen and heat stresses dndc performed similarly to cascade models daycent and stics for simulating soil water content but performed better for simulating soil n particularly over stics which at the time did not include a soil freeze thaw sub model stics overestimated n loss in the late fall but snow insulation and freeze thaw have now been incorporated summer 2018 dndc has not been benchmarked against a computational based water quality model for assessing full system water and n dynamics the usda ars root zone water quality model rzwqm2 ma et al 2012 is a detailed hydrologic model for simulating biogeochemical processes in the root zone the model released in 1992 includes design features and concepts from several other root zone models the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat hoogenboom et al 2017 crop model is also embedded in its code the benefit of using dssat is that it is widely used for simulating crop growth and phenology worldwide the rzwqm2 model simulates a wide range of soil plant atmospheric processes and includes much more detailed hydrologic processes than dndc including the green ampt equation for infiltration richard s equation for water flow and hooghoudt s equation for tile drainage several studies have shown that rzwqm2 can be employed successfully for simulating water flow to tile drains xian et al 2017 ma et al 2012 qi et al 2011b akhand et al 2003 kanwar et al 1997 there have previously been successful comparisons of crop models which use simpler hydrology to computational models malone et al 2017 but such assessments are rare particularly across a wide range of metrics at high temporal resolution in order to properly understand and quantify model performance detailed input data and a wide array of observations for benchmarking water soil and crop related processes are crucial in this paper we use a comprehensive dataset that includes measurements of corn and soybean yields common crops grown in the midwestern u s corn soybean and winter rye biomass crop n uptake continuous soil water content at multiple depths and near continuous estimates of water flow and n loading to tile drains across multiple years qi et al 2011a b ma et al 2012 the objectives of this study were to i calibrate and validate the dndc and rzwqm2 models for simulating crop growth soil water flow and nitrogen loading to tile drains in cropping systems with and without cover crops ii compare the performance of the models for simulating crop growth soil hydrology and water quality and iii document the strengths and weaknesses of the models for simulating water flow and n loss to tile drains and recommend future developments in doing so we compare the performance of simpler water processes in dndc which are in fact common in many agricultural models to the more detailed hydrology based model rzwqm2 in an effort to discern what level of process complexity is necessary for simulating water quality at daily monthly and annual scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 field studies the model comparison was performed using measurements of water flow n loss to tile drains and biomass data from a corn soybean study with and without cover crops at the agricultural drainage water quality research and demonstration site near gilmore city in pocahontas county north central iowa 42 42 n 104 00 w lawlor et al 2008 qi et al 2011a b qi and helmers 2010 the general soil texture classification of the site is a fine loamy or fine clay loam and included 4 soil classifications nicollet webster canisteo and okoboji usda 1985 the average particle size distribution across the 16 plots used in our analysis was 33 sand 35 silt and 32 clay and the bulk density was 1 34 g cm 3 the average annual jan 1st to dec 31st temperature was 8 c and annual precipitation was 821 mm as part of a larger study 16 hydrologically distinct plots 15 38 m long of completely randomized block design were established in the fall of 2004 and lasted 5 years until 2009 the study consisted of two treatments with cover crops and two controls each with 4 reps treatment 1 trt1 consisted of winter rye prior to corn in odd years and prior to soybean in even years whereas treatment 2 trt2 was the reverse phase with winter rye prior to soybean in odd years and prior to corn in even years table 1 the controls ctrl1 and ctrl2 included the same cropping system but with no winter rye cover crop rye secale cereale brand name rymin glyphosate resistant corn dekalb 50 45 77 000 seed ha 1 and soybean pioneer 92 m40 group 2 middle season 439 750 seed ha 1 were planted using a drill seeder with dates determined by field conditions but at the same dates for control and no control treatments the agronomic practices for tillage and fertilizer application were consistent with those usually employed in iowa and the scheduling of events is shown in table 1 aqueous ammonia fertilizer at a rate of 140 kg n ha 1 was applied on corn shortly after emergence and no fertilizer was applied to the soybean or winter rye the gilmore city site included a large complement of measurements such as water content at 4 depths biomass and crop n uptake and daily time step measurements of water flow and n concentration to tile drains tile drains were 106 cm deep 7 6 cm diameter and drain spacing was 7 6 m for details regarding sampling techniques see qi and helmers 2010 and lawlor et al 2008 2 2 model overview as discussed in the following sections the dndc model employs simple equations and methods for soil hydrology whereas rzwqm2 which was primarily developed for simulating water quality thus includes much more mechanistic and computation intensive equations table 2 fig 1 an earlier version 2 0 2010 of the rzwqm2 was previously calibrated and validated for the gilmore city site qi et al 2011b but in this study a newer version 3 0 2015 was employed in a similar manner using calibration and validation procedures described in ma et al 2012 once calibrated the newer version performed similarly with marginally improved results 2 2 1 dndc the denitrification decomposition dndc model li et al 2012 is a widely used process based model for simulating the effects of climate and agricultural management on crop growth soil c n cycling trace gas emissions and nutrient loss from runoff and drainage it includes several sub models for predicting crop growth soil climate decomposition nitrification denitrification and fermentation the model was first developed to estimate nitrous oxide emissions but was later expanded to estimate soil c n cycling water drainage and nitrogen loss to tile drains li et al 2006 and finally to include full farm facility and livestock systems li et al 2012 the model has been tested and validated extensively for simulating crop growth ghg emissions soil carbon change and ammonia volatilization worldwide ehrhardt et al 2018 brilli et al 2017 zhang and niu 2016 gilhespy et al 2014 but it has seldom been tested for simulating water flow and nutrient losses to tile drains efforts are made by the model developers to minimize the amount of input data and process time required thus some of the processes in dndc are purposefully kept simple the current release version of dndc employs a cascade flow water model simulating bulk water flux and n transport through the profile table 2 fig 1 li et al 2006 included a deep water pool to increase the default 50 cm soil profile depth to that of a tile drain however the deep water pool depth can t be adjusted without recompiling the model n adsorption and transformations are not included in the additional profile and a fluctuating water table is not simulated adsorption and desorption of nh4 based on the langmuir equation was also incorporated in his study top 50 cm of soil profile as well as a simplistic empirical relationship or recession curve to delay drainage by soil layer this recession curve required parameterization of coefficients for each soil type tonitto et al 2007a and is no longer active in the current release version tonitto et al 2007a found that after calibration of the recession equation in dndc the model performance was satisfactory for simulating annual water flow and nitrate loss to tile drains when aggregated across a watershed however dndc consistently under predicted monthly drainage and the model was not tested using daily data several modelling teams have developed specific versions of the model to better enable the simulation of regional soils climate events crop cultivars and management practices in our study a canadian version of dndc dndcv can was employed which is well suited for over winter conditions that occur in iowa this version was developed over the last several years by introducing crop specific growth curves for wheat corn and soybean grant et al 2016 by improving the prediction of evapotranspiration et dutta et al 2016 by adding a new ammonia sub model for simulating manure slurry additions congreves et al 2016 and urea fertilizer the model was also revised for simulating the effects of biomass crop residue snow cover and soil texture on soil temperature dutta et al 2018 at the beginning of this study all developments for canada dndc were added to the u s release version thus creating an up to date model version which includes both the u s and canadian developments available at https github com brianbgrant dndcv can 2 2 2 rzwqm2 the root zone water quality model version 3 0 2015 ma et al 2012 was developed to simulate major biogeochemical processes in agricultural systems that affect water quality in the plant root zone and below the root zone runoff and to tile drains the model is largely one dimensional but includes quasi two dimensional lateral flow to tile drains similar to dndc the model simulates a wide range of agricultural management practices but it includes more detailed processes for simulating water and nutrient transport including mechanistic tile drainage table 2 fig 1 rzwqm2 includes dssat 4 0 cropping system models jones et al 2003 with ceres and cropgro components ma et al 2005 2006 and thus can simulate crop growth and development for a wide range of crops using an established and verified framework rzwqm2 is more data intensive than dndc requiring a more detailed physical representation of the soil profile it requires parameters for describing soil water retention and other hydraulic properties it also requires more intensive computer processing time since it simulates a heterogeneous soil profile and includes mechanistic equations such as numerical procedures for solving the richard s equation and green ampt infiltration table 2 fig 1 our hypothesis is that rzwqm2 should be more accurate than dndc in predicting water flow and nutrient loading but will require more data to initialize and calibrate 2 3 model initialization calibration and validation for each research location treatment 1 includes a winter rye cover crop was used to calibrate the models whereas treatment 2 and the controls were used to validate the models calibration was conducted by trial and error towards minimalizing rmse for yield biomass drainage and n loss to tiles model simulations were run for a ten year spin up period prior to the beginning of the experiment to stabilize water and n pools in the models soil inputs including percent sand silt and clay bulk density soil c content field capacity and wilting point were available from measurements taken at the site across several depths table s1 soil properties were not measured below 120 cm thus the values from the 90 120 cm depth were assumed to apply below 120 cm soil properties were similar between plots and initial tests with both models indicated little influence on modelled water dynamics thus the same properties were used for all treatments and controls similar to qi et al 2011b 2 3 1 rzwqm2 calibration detailed soil properties were input for each measured depth increment table s1 the initial carbon and nitrogen residues in the soil profile were determined from thorp et al 2007 including crop residue and microbial pools initial soil moisture was set based on sampling in november 2005 with saturation occurring below 60 cm depth to initiate the simulation of a water table in the model the soil depth above the impermeable layer was set to 390 cm and a ksat rate of 0 01 cm h 1 was set in the bottom layer to limit flow and maintain the water table the lateral saturated conductivity used in the hooghoudt equation for each soil layer was set to 2ksat brookes corey is a four parameter nonlinear curve fitting model for fitting water retention data two of these parameters saturated and residual water contents were based on one third bar measurements the other two parameters are used for curve fitting the 2nd exponent of k curve n2 was calculated as 3Œª 2 and the 2nd intercept c2 was estimated as ksat pb n2 where Œª is the pore size distribution index and pb is the bubbling pressure cm the background n in precipitation was set to 0 5 mg n l 1 and 1 3 mg n l 1 for nh4 and no3 respectively qi et al 2011b agriculture management practices including planting and harvest dates tillage type and scheduling fertilizer rates and scheduling were also used as inputs table 1 most of the dssat crop parameters for the corn ib 1068 dekalb 521 and soybean 990002 m group 2 were left as default table s2 however a few were modified to minimize nrmse of yield in the calibration treatment trt1 for corn three crop parameters were adjusted the maximum possible number of kernels per plant g2 and the kernel filling rate during linear grain filling stage g3 mg d 1 were decreased to 722 and 6 55 respectively the phylochron interval between successive leaf tip appearance phint c days was increased to 46 for soybean only maximum leaf photosynthesis rate at 30c 350vpm and high light lfmax umol co2 m 2 s 1 was modified lowering it from 1 03 to 0 80 the parameters of the winter rye crop were based on a u s winter wheat crop cultivar 990003 winter us since a winter rye cultivar was not available in the dssat database significant calibration was required with most of the calibration performed in qi et al 2011b in this study we further adjusted four parameters to minimize nrmse for biomass in trt1 table s2 phylochron interval time between successive leaf appearance phint was increased to 100 conversion rate from photosynthetically active radiation to dry mater before the end of leaf growth paruv g mj 1 was increased to 3 3 lamina area to weight ratio of standard first leaf larws cm2 g 1 was increased to 300 and finally lamina area to weight ratio phase 2 lawr2 cm2 g 1 was increased to 280 phint was adjusted to delay growth in the spring and the remaining three parameters were adjusted to increase growth rate before calibration rzwqm2 simulated average annual mineralization rates that were lower than expected 100 kg n ha 1y 1 which resulted in low rates of n loss to tile drains carpenter boggs et al 2000 found that average mineralization rates were 142 kg n ha 1 for a 189 day growing season for a corn soybean rotation in eastern south dakota clay loam soil at 1 8 soil c rzwqm2 was calibrated by increasing the decay rates of the organic matter pools by 38 which in turn resulted in an acceptable rate of n loss to tile drains nare 3 5 nse 0 92 and level of crop n uptake nare 6 4 nrmse 17 total organic n in the soil profile remained stable within 0 5 of the starting value over the five year study 2 3 2 dndc calibration the dndc model was less time consuming to calibrate largely because it employs less intensive hydrologic processes and equations with fewer parameters the processing time for a simulation was 12 times faster only the soil physical and chemical properties for the top soil layer are required as input table s1 these properties include bulk density soil texture clay fraction field capacity at 0 33 bar wilting point at 15 bar ph ksat porosity soil organic carbon the model employs a pedo transfer function to estimate a decline in soil carbon and an increase in bulk density down the soil profile this may result in an erroneous approximation of the soil profile the n concentration in precipitation was set to be 1 8 mg n l 1 to be equivalent to the total value used in rzwqm2 this resulted in an average annual atmospheric n input of 14 1 kg n ha 1y 1 dndc uses the scs runoff curve number method developed by the usda natural resources conservation service and also the modified universal soil loss equation musle which includes the manning s coefficient for overland flow for runoff the scs curve number was set to 64 for a well drained row crop with residue and clay loam soil and the manning s roughness coefficient was set to 0 19 for conventional tillage with residue the option was employed to use all climate drivers on a daily time step maximum and minimum temperature precipitation wind speed radiation and relative humidity dndc requires similar agricultural management inputs as rzwqm2 table 1 the crop parameters in dndc are simpler and less varied however they often require substantial modification since values are generalized for specific crop types and are not provided for cultivars the user inputs are easily understood and include inputs such as max biomass production of grain biomass fractions of plant organs c n ratios of plant organs thermal degree days to maturity water demand g water g dry matter and optimum temperature for growth other crop parameters are internal per crop type and cannot be modified without recompiling the model such as minimum and maximum temperature for growth effect of atmospheric co2 on assimilation effect of co2 on water and n use efficiency and temperature stress during anthesis in this study we modified the default parameters for corn soybean and winter wheat to minimize nrmse for yield the thermal degree days to maturity tdd for soybean was set to 2500 the crop water demand was increased from 350 to 420 g water g dry matter and max potential biomass of grain was set to 2550 kg c ha 1y 1 for corn the max biomass of grain was set to 4500 kg c ha 1y 1 and the c n ratios of grain leaf and root were modified from 50 80 80 to 35 70 70 respectively to increase and improve n uptake relative to average measured values and resulting n stress affecting corn yields biomass the default rye crop in dndc was adjusted to improve the simulation of winter rye biomass relative to the control by lowering the tdd from 2000 to 1400 and lowering the optimum temperature for growth from 25 to 18 c similar to rzwqm2 the default soc partitioning som pool sizes and decay rates resulted in too little n mineralization and under prediction of n in tile drains the humus fraction was lowered from 0 8 to 0 7 after calibration the average annual mineralization over the five year study was simulated to be 169 kg n ha 1y 1 in rzwqm2 whereas it was 170 kg n ha 1y 1 in dndc 2 4 statistical measures for testing model performance the following statistical measures were used to evaluate model accuracy in predicting crop yields biomass and crop n pearson s r correlation coefficient r normalized average relative error nare and normalized root mean square error nrmse the nare value represents the percent over or under prediction of a model relative to measurements it is similar to percent bias pbias but of opposite sign 1 r

nse maximum possible value is 1 indicates the model estimates are more accurate than the average of observations ahuja et al 2000 considered model performance was satisfactory for yields and biomass if nare 15 and jamieson et al 1991 considered excellent performance if rsme 10 good 20 fair 30 and poor 30 moriasi et al 2007 suggested that model performance for simulating water and n flow was satisfactory if nse 0 5 water flow if nare 25 and n loss if nare 70 3 results and discussion the gilmore city dataset offers a large range of biomass soil water storage n and water flow measurements from daily to annual scales which was systematically used to assess model performance and potential areas for improving hydrological processes in the following sections 3 1 crop yield and growth accurate simulation of crop growth including the impacts of temperature water and nutrient stresses on production is crucial for simulating water and n dynamics in agricultural models recently guest et al 2018 reported that dndcv can outperformed two water budget models that do not simulate crop growth in this study both dndc and rzwqm2 performed well in simulating corn and soybean yields table 3 fig s3a rzwqm2 performed a little better than dndc for corn across the three validation treatments but for both models nare was 4 and nrmse was 11 soybean yields were slightly overestimated by both models 8 nare and the nrmse was higher than for corn but simulations were still considered to be good higher relative nrmse may be expected when simulating lower yields rzwqm2 tested in this study performed marginally better lower nare and nrmse for both corn and soybean yields than did the 2010 version which was previously used to simulate the same cropping system qi et al 2011b the rmse values for both dndc and rzwqm2 in this study were lower for corn than in jarecki et al 2018 who estimated rmse s of over 1100 kg dm ha 1 using dndcv can the nrmse for both models was however higher than estimated by he et al 2018 using dndcv can who calculated values from 4 0 to 6 1 for corn and 6 4 11 8 for soybean but in each case the validation simulations were performed over only 2 years of data corn and soybean biomass over the growing season for the calibration treatment was predicted with good model performance by both rzwqm2 and dndc table 4 fig 2 note however that dndc does not simulate soybean senescence which is a model weakness likely resulting in an overestimation of the last biomass observation in 2008 fig 2 dndc also does not simulate water excess on crop growth as was pointed out in sansoulet et al 2014 but since this was a well drained site there was likely little influence corn biomass was predicted with good performance by both models across all validation treatments with a little better performance by dndc in trt2 and ctrl2 corn in 2006 and 2008 soybean biomass was predicted with good performance by both models for ctrl1 observed soybean biomass was low in trt2 and ctrl2 in 2007 and 2009 and dndc captured this reasonably well fig 2 however rzwqm2 over predicted biomass throughout most of the season note that simulated biomass decreased in rzwqm2 at the end of the season during senescence and the prediction of soybean yield for the validation treatments was good table 3 the models over predicted biomass more so in trt2 fig 2 when observed soybean growth appeared to be suppressed by low seasonal growing degree days gdd fig s1 the models were calibrated for soybean growth only in 2006 and 2008 when gdd was higher the cumulative seasonal winter rye biomass and n uptake was predicted quite well by both models with are always being 20 however the timing of growth and n uptake was sometimes off resulting in high nrmse table 5 fig s2 the high nrmse was in part due to the low biomass and n uptake but there was also difficulty in simulating the correct timing of emergence in spring in rzwqm2 a winter wheat cultivar was adjusted to simulate winter rye as no existing cultivar was available and in dndc a generalized rye crop was adjusted to simulate winter rye this suggests room for future improvement 3 2 soil hydrology an analysis of water partitioning fig 3 indicated that both models predicted similar levels of annual drainage runoff and et with greater transpiration occurring in the years with cover crop particularly for rzwqm2 which simulated on average 29 2 mm transpiration from winter rye in comparison to 19 2 mm for dndc it is interesting that the dndc model which employs a simple cascade water flow approach predicted similar water balances as rzwqm2 particularly for treatments with no cover crop there has however been considerable efforts recently to improve estimates of et and adjust crop coefficients using the penman monteith approach dutta et al 2016 et is the largest component of water loss from the agroecosystem in this study and likely has a large influence on how much water is transported down the soil profile rzwqm2 performed much better than did dndc for simulating soil water storage in the 0 60 cm soil profile fig 4 table s3 and soil water content by layer fig s4 since dndc only simulates water to effectively 100 cm depth and plant roots don t have access to the water table soil water content during the warmer summer months were greatly underestimated in an attempt to meet crop demands the inclusion of mechanistic tile drainage allowing for simulation of a water table would likely greatly improve water content simulation during the warmer periods soil water content was generally overestimated by dndc near the soil surface and underestimated deeper in the profile which was presumably caused by the lack of root distribution algorithms the inability to simulate a heterogeneous soil profile and no water table the dndc model currently does not estimate changes in root density in the soil profile and plants uptake water equally across the top 50 cm it is expected that the inclusion of simple root density functions by crop type such as those described by pedersen et al 2010 could further improve water uptake and the distribution of water down the profile note that dndc currently only outputs soil water that is not frozen so the winter period is not shown as reported in a recent review of c n models brilli et al 2017 and from other sources he et al 2018 dutta et al 2016 uzoma et al 2015 abdalla et al 2011 deng et al 2011 smith et al 2008 saggar et al 2004 dndc was found to have weaknesses in simulating soil water content and in many of these studies the lack of the ability to simulate a heterogeneous soil profile was noted 3 3 water flow and n loss to tile drains the success of a model in simulating soil water and n dynamics is relevant to different time scales determined by the criteria set forth in a study time scales of interest may include those over the growing season to estimate water and n dynamics for overall crop requirements or a shorter time frame may need to be considered to assess water and n during critical phases of growth further it may be important to estimate n and p loss to drains and to runoff on a monthly basis in order to assess the risk of eutrophication in water bodies on a daily basis soil water and n status is important for estimating several processes including n2o emissions from denitrification which can be driven by individual rainfall events verg√© et al 2017 found that the grey water footprint of corn production varied greatly across time scales with the greatest footprint of 2700 mm water daily to zero annually thus in this study we assess water flow to tile drains at three different time steps daily monthly and annually nitrogen loss to tile drains is assessed monthly and annually since n concentration in bulk water samples was measured only when water attained a certain depth in the collecting reservoir generally 1 2 weeks 3 3 1 water flow to tile drains the dndc model performed well for simulating water loss to tile drains on an annual basis from 2005 to 2009 with similar statistics to rzwqm2 table 6 fig s3b on average across the three validation treatments nse 0 76 was very similar between the models rzwqm2 performed better for ctrl1 and trt2 however dndc performed better for ctrl2 likewise both models performed well for simulating monthly water flow to tiles with remarkably similar statistics in all cases nse was 0 5 however both models under predicted water flow for trt2 and over predicted it for ctrl2 this could be attributed to variability in measurements since the standard error calculated from the 4 plot replicates was sometimes high particularly in 2007 and 2008 when flow to drains was highest fig s5 measurement variability was not accounted for in the statistics and the observations showed more overall water to tile drains in trt2 with cover crop than in ctrl2 without cover crop which is unlikely both models predicted slightly more water loss to tile drains due to less transpiration when there was no cover crop there was a simulated trade off between evaporation and transpiration but the cover crop was still predicted to reduce subsurface drainage volume which is consistent with some experimental studies strock et al 2004 qi and helmers 2010 a number of studies showed no effect of cover crop on subsurface water drainage volume drury et al 2014 qi et al 2011a qi et al 2008 kaspar et al 2007 this could be due to the trade off between reduced evaporation and increased transpiration when a cover crop was added in rotation and or measurement variability masking a small influence in a study by david et al 2009 6 models swat daycent epic drainmod n ii and two versions of dndc 82a and 82 h were compared for simulating aggregated water and nitrate flux to tile drains it was found that all models except dndc82h performed well in simulating monthly water flux nse 0 5 but the models which were designed to simulate tile drainage swat epic and drainmod n demonstrated better performance nse 0 68 all of the models investigated included a cascade flow approach to simulatie drainage at this time the dndc model versions tested included a thornwaite approach which sometimes greatly overestimate et thus it is not surprising that dndc82h underestimated water loss to drains by 33 in our current study dndc includes the penman monteith approach with crop specific coefficients for et dutta et al 2016 and the nse for monthly flow to tiles was above 0 6 for all treatments it is very important to simulate an appropriate level of et since it is usually the largest component of water loss the hermes model which includes cascade water flow was previously used to simulate water and n loss to tile drains in a similar cropping system as used in our current study and it was found that once calibrated the model could simulate the lower n loss that occurred when cover crops were included in a corn soybean cropping system with a reasonable degree of accuracy the hermes model was compared to rzwqm2 which was used to simulate the same cropping system in a previous study li et al 2008 it was found that hermes did not simulate the year to year variability in nitrate concentration nor the monthly drainage as well as did rzwqm2 drainage was over predicted in the september through december 2003 2005 period likely because hermes did not include the reduced evaporation from residue cover in our current study dndc does include this impact and simulations of monthly water and n loss to drains were similar to rzwqm2 both rzwqm2 and dndc also include snow dynamics which hermes did not and soil freeze thaw processes late season drainage can be greatly overestimated without these processes which was the case for stics in comparison to dndc and daycent in guest et al 2017 rzwqm2 performed substantially better than dndc for simulating daily water flow table 6 the dndc model tended to capture the start time of flow events but flow occurred too rapidly with over prediction near the start of the event and under prediction near the end an example of this trend is shown in fig 5 for ctrl2 and the full comparison for 2007 and 2008 the years in which daily water flow was available qi et al 2011b is shown in fig s6 this phenomenon can be expected from a cascade flow model which employs a bulk flux method for n and water movement and does not consider delays in drainage it is important that the timing of these events are simulated correctly since soil water and oxygen content are critical drivers for denitrification and even short term erroneous predictions can greatly influence nitrous oxide emissions uzoma et al 2015 a previous version of dndc dndc87 included a recession curve to retain water in each layer slowing drainage based on an empirical equation driven by clay content this algorithm was developed by li et al 2006 and employed by tonitto et al 2007a b 2010 we investigated re enabling this routine in dndc on a test basis and found that after parameterizing the recession curve for the calibration treatment the daily water flow was similar to rzwqm2 and statistics for the validation treatments were greatly improved to be as good as rzwqm2 however soil water content was greatly over predicted nare 21 8 resulting in exaggerated rates of denitrification and n2o emissions were increased by 26 thus we do not recommend using this approach and it is not employed in the current u s dndc release version 3 3 2 nitrogen loading to tile drains both models performed satisfactorily in estimating n loss to tiles on an annual basis table 7 fig s3c with similar average statistics across the validation treatments nse 0 72 and 0 65 for dndc and rzwqm2 respectively the models generally performed satisfactorily in simulating no3 n loss to tile drains on a monthly basis however dndc performed a little better with acceptable statistics for ctrl2 table 7 fig 6 david et al 2009 when comparing the performance of 6 models found that two different versions of dndc predicted n loss to tiles within 10 but the monthly timing of n loss was relatively poorly simulated with nse 0 4 which is considerably less than in our current study table 7 for all six models investigated david et al 2009 indicated that inaccuracy in predicting the variation in monthly water flux resulted in inaccuracies in predicting n losses two of the three models which included tile drainage simulation performed better swat and drainmod n ii with nse 0 5 in our study both dndc and rzwqm2 agreed in estimating the magnitude of n loss to tile drains however similar to water flow to tile drains both models underestimated loss in trt2 and overestimated loss in ctrl2 table 7 fig s7 the observed and simulated cumulative water flow and n loss to tile drains on average across the 4 treatments was indeed very similar between the models and observations fig s8 the over and under predictions may be due to measurement variability amongst plots especially when one considers that observations had greater average annual n loss in trt2 39 9 kg ha 1 y 1 than in ctrl2 33 7 kg ha 1 y 1 this result seems unlikely considering that we generally expect less n loss to drains when a cover crop is included which was the case for trt1 34 4 kg ha 1 y 1 and ctrl1 41 0 kg ha 1 y 1 both models consistently estimated less n loss to tile drains when a cover crop was included in rotation which is a common finding in a number of experimental studies malone et al 2017 drury et al 2014 li et al 2008 kaspar et al 2007 parkin et al 2006 strock et al 2004 logsdon et al 2002 qi et al 2008 2011c did not find any difference in n loading when a cover crop was included in the study we simulated this was likely because the winter during the 5 year experimental period was colder than usual leading to low winter rye biomass in long term simulations over 40 years an 11 reduction of n loading was reported qi et al 2011b the observed rates of loss were generally high with an annual average loss of 37 3 kg no3 n ha 1 y 1 across all treatments it may be expected that no3 n leaching is high in a well drained soil with subsurface drainage but runoff of phosphorous sediment nh4 n and no3 n is generally low lawlor et al 2008 in this study there were no observations available for runoff but both models predicted minimal no3 n runoff 1 kg n ha 1y 1 for all years and treatments which was expected for this site 4 conclusions it is important to continue to scrutinize and compare agriculture models against high quality datasets to identify differences in model structure that result in improved performance sometimes during model development there are options to include more complex processes and model structure however a developer may purposefully keep the inputs and complexity manageable in order to minimize input requirements and reduce the level of required modeler expertise in this study we compare the performance of two widely used process based models for simulating crop growth and soil water dynamics and no3 n loss to tile drains the conceptual design of each of these models was focused on different objectives the dndc model was mostly developed and employed for simulating ghg emissions and soil carbon change whereas rzwqm2 focused primarily on crop growth and water quality it was informative to discover that a simple cascade water sub model dndc performed adequately in comparison to measurements and similarly with respect to rzwqm2 across a wide range of metrics including crop yield biomass n uptake of winter rye annual and monthly water flow and no3 n loss to tile drains the penman monteith method for estimating et in dndc recently improved by dutta et al 2016 was a strong factor in estimating the appropriate water balance particularly since et was estimated to be a large percent of the water budget it was interesting to find that bulk gravity drainage regulated by cascade water flow through a homogeneous soil profile was effective in simulating water flow on an annual and monthly basis but not on a daily basis if this scale of resolution is deemed appropriate for the study objective then no further detail in hydrologic processes may be needed estimates from dndc did reveal shortcomings in simulating soil water storage soil water contents down the profile and daily water flow events whereas rzwqm2 generally performed adequately for these metrics fine scale temporal simulation of water and n dynamics can greatly impact soil water and nutrient levels thereby influencing several biogeochemical processes such as decomposition denitrification nitrification and methanogenisis these processes are largely dependent on soil water content since dndc is primarily used to simulate ghg emissions we recommend that developments be carried out for dndc to further improve its hydrological processes such changes may include a deeper and heterogeneous soil profile inclusion of root distribution functions inclusion of improved water flow a fluctuating water table and or a mechanistic drainage sub model a mechanistic tile drainage sub model could also enable the simulation of the impacts of drainage depth and spacing controlled drainage and irrigation on nutrient cycling and ghg emissions which would greatly increase the usefulness of an already widely used model considerations should however be taken when contemplating model developments more complex processes can increase model input requirements inputs which may not be available especially in regional large scale studies pedo transfer functions are sometimes used to estimating soil water inputs for models but they also come with a degree of uncertainty most of the suggested additions for dndc likely would not greatly increase model input requirements or simulation time however it remains questionable whether or not to include a computationally
