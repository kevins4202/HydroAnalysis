2395,this study used eight empirical equations such as kozeny carman k c terzaghi hazen slitcher kruger sauerbrei navfacdm7 and zamarin to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity from soil particle size distribution and surface nmr porosity the estimated empirical hydraulic conductivities were compared with the saturated surface nuclear magnetic resonance surface nmr hydraulic conductivity it was found that most of the empirical equations showed poor correlation with the surface nmr hydraulic conductivity except kozeny carman kc hazen and zamarin equations the value of the coefficient β of each equation is modified in such a way as to obtain a linear equation with the unit slope to improve the performance and accuracy of empirical equations the modified kozeny carman equation showed the maximum correlation r 2 0 904 pearson s r 0 951 and rmse 6 36 in comparison with other empirical equations the navfacdm7 and the terzaghi equations showed the highest underestimated hydraulic

conductivity as related to the square of the characteristic pore diameter many researchers proposed their equations for saturated hydraulic conductivity based on this concept bear 1972 scheidegger 1954 saturated hydraulic conductivity is crucial for the calculation of environmental geology hydrogeological and aquifer flow meegoda and gunasekera 1992 d andrea and boadu 2001 ahuja et al 1984 and ahuja et al 1993 developed a field method to figure out the soil s hydraulic conductivity and how it changes over space and time this was done because standard methods are expensive and take a long time the kozeny carman equation showed how the saturated hydraulic conductivity is linked to the effective porosity of the soil suleiman and ritchie 2001 generally saturated hydraulic conductivity is measured in the laboratory using constant and falling head permeability methods at the same time there is inherent variability in the hydraulic conductivity for different types of soil and the reliability of data depending on the representative samples regalado and muñoz carpena 2004 schaap and lebron 2001 the laboratory methods are time consuming cumbersome and expensive and the experimental data can t be directly applied to field study therefore researchers and scientists have been looking for field and alternative methods to estimate hydraulic conductivity song et al 2009 urumović 2016 several field methods and empirical and semi empirical equations have been proposed to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity for aquifers d andrea and boadu 2001 used the regression based model to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity of different types of soils this model incorporated parameters that adequately represented the grain size distribution textural and hydraulic properties were characterized based on these parameters of soil and a combination of these properties was used to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity chapuis and aubertin 2003 predicted saturated hydraulic conductivity using empirical and statistical models they found that the kozeny carman equation fairly predicts saturated hydraulic conductivity for most of the soils including clay the observed minor discrepancies in the data may be due to practical reasons several empirical equations were used to estimate hydraulic conductivity for unconsolidated aquifer material the soil samples were collected from test holes for particle size analysis and the result showed that the kozeny carman equation was an estimator of hydraulic conductivity for all samples at the same time some empirical methods overestimated and underestimated hydraulic conductivity odong 2007 song et al 2009 verified the hydraulic conductivity estimated from the particle size distribution and permeameter for elkhorn river soil samples nebraska empirical methods showed larger values compared to permeameter values and five empirical equations have 3 6 times larger hydraulic conductivity than the laboratory values ishaku et al 2011 used empirical equations to estimate aquifer hydraulic conductivity in the jimeta yola study site terzaghi equation was found to be the best estimator of hydraulic conductivity followed by the kozeny carman equation devlin 2015 developed hydrogeosievexl an excel based spreadsheet application that calculates hydraulic conductivity from grain size distribution curves using 15 different empirical equations rosas et al 2015 collected 39 sediment soil samples from ephemeral streams in saudi arabia the porosity grain size distribution and hydraulic conductivity were estimated for all laboratory samples and empirical equations were also used to estimate hydraulic conductivity most of the empirical equations were poorly correlated with observed laboratory data modified empirical equations showed significant improvement in the estimation of hydraulic conductivity hwang et al 2017 compared hydraulic conductivities of the coarse medium and fine grained sand with the help of empirical equations a relative porosity model and breakthrough curve analysis kango et al 2019 studied the effects of soil grains on aquifer hydraulic conductivity they filled marble chips in the natural borehole and maintained a laminar flow regime to develop a power model khalil and monterio santos 2009 analyzed the groundwater saturation relation with aquifer resistivity and hydraulic conductivity from kozeny carman kc and archie s second law they concluded their finding in three relations an inverse power relation for saturated aquifer when porosity is the same as water saturation an inverse polynomial relation for the unsaturated aquifer and direct relation for the poorly saturated aquifer several hydrological methods are used to estimate hydraulic conductivity in groundwater aquifers these methods can provide hydraulic conductivity within the study area however some of these methods have been applied with limitations butler 2005 chen et al 2012 ren et al 2016 suggested a new hydraulic conductivity void ratio equation based on poiseuille s law this equation showed improved hydraulic conductivity estimation over the classical kozeny carman equation shahbazi et al 2020 used an empirical equation to establish the relationship between permeability and depth and it was compared with the analytical results ganiyu et al 2020 collected twelve soil samples from oyo state nigeria to analyze all soil parameters based on standard procedure these parameters predicted the saturated hydraulic conductivity water content etc were predicted based on these parameters the nuclear magnetic resonance nmr technique is used in hydro geophysics geophysics and hydrological research areas for surface laboratory and logging applications nmr has direct sensitivity to water molecules hydrogen proton therefore structural properties of the aquifer such as porosity hydraulic conductivity and pore size distribution can be estimated kenyon 1997 sen et al 1990 straley et al 1997 müller et al 2005 performed laboratory experiments to verify the hydraulic conductivity estimated from surface nmr and particle size distribution the laboratory data were also compared to assess the scaling effect in surface nmr data they concluded that the surface nmr data was suitable for predicting hydraulic conductivity in sandy silty and clayey aquifer materials ioannidis et al 2006 studied the gravity driven drainage initially proposed by chen et al 1994 based on their observations relative hydraulic conductivity is directly related to the nmr relaxation time at different saturation levels yaramanci and müller petke 2009 stated that the surface nmr is the only geophysical exploration technique that non invasively collects the aquifer properties knight et al 2012 used surface nmr to explore groundwater aquifer properties and estimate hydraulic conductivity using the link between nmr relaxation data and the geometry of pore spaces dlubac et al 2013 used proton nuclear magnetic resonance nmr logging at lexington site nebraska to estimate pore spaces aquifer porosity and geometry both parameters can be used for the estimation of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity ren et al 2019 used the nmr logging method for quick estimation of hydraulic conductivity with high vertical resolution they interpreted nmr logging data to calibrate an empirical equation to transform borehole data into hydraulic conductivity in hydro geophysical applications permeability is often replaced with hydraulic conductivity because it is integrated with fluid properties such as density and viscosity the surface nmr was primarily applied on sandstones however unconsolidated material is more prevalent in the aquifer than the sandstones dlugosch et al 2013 formulated the kozeny godefroy model which is based on material pore size and bulk water relaxation the bulk water relaxation can significantly affect the nmr measurements in coarse material maurer and knight 2016 used an empirical model along with three other models to analyze the hydraulic conductivity based on nmr data the selected model did not show any improvement in hydraulic conductivity results zhang et al 2018 surface nmr technique was used to estimate the effect of saturated hydraulic conductivity on landslide mass in the three gorges reservoir area they obtained a series of reliable data with the calibration of field measurements teng et al 2019 used the nmr technique to measure pore size distribution and saturated hydraulic conductivity estimation in saturated clayey soil samples static compaction consolidation and proctor compaction methods were adopted for soil sample preparation spurlin et al 2019 conducted several field nmr experiments to investigate water content and hydraulic conductivity the nmr measurements were compared with the cone penetrometer testing data singh et al 2021 carried out several surface nmr experiments to categorize the geophysical strata and it was compared with the nearby borehole data skibbe et al 2020 used a python toolbox coupled with electrical resistivity tomography and magnetic resonance for inversion and complex surface nmr data modeling this technique only allowed variation in one or two dimensions of their parameters mazzilli et al 2020 applied surface nmr to monitor the unsaturated karst zone of the aquifer in southern france their findings demonstrated the efficiency and applicability of this technique in the infiltration dynamics of karst s unsaturated aquifer apart from the above studies on empirical equation hydraulic conductivities researchers carman 1956 carman 1937 hazen 1892 slichter 1899 terzaghi 1925 kozeny 1927 vukovic and soro 1992 chesnaux et al 2011 lu et al 2012 have investigated for the different types of soils this provides the basis of the present study to understand how empirical equation hydraulic conductivities are related to the surface nmr hydraulic conductivity the developed modified empirical equations can be used for similar types of subsurface geological sites this study is carried out to address the following research questions 1 how does the empirical equation of hydraulic conductivities related to the surface nmr hydraulic conductivity 2 how many percentage values are under and overestimated with respect to the 1 1 line 45 line from origin 3 can the modified β coefficients enhance the performance of the empirical equations in this study a borewell was excavated and soil samples were collected at different depths a representative soil sample was considered for sieve analysis and particle size distribution in the laboratory the surface nmr field experiments were carried out near the borewell and gmr qc software was used to record the surface nmr data afterward surface nmr data was processed through gmr 1d inversion software eight empirical equations were used to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity based on the aquifer s particle size distribution and porosity these estimated hydraulic conductivities were compared with the surface nmr hydraulic conductivity to improve the performance accuracy of each empirical equation beta coefficient was modified to obtain the linear equation with unit slope 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the study area was located at the foothill of the himalayan range in the southwestern part of uttrakhand state india both surface nmr field experiments and a borehole were drilled at the study site the local earth s magnetic field 49308 2 n t magnetic inclination 47 3215 0 and magnetic declination 1 4043 0 were measured during the experiment using a magnetometer to avoid temporal and spatial errors the local coordinates of the survey site are 29 54 12 3 n and 77 57 26 6 e respectively a 26 m diameter wire of the main loop was spread on the ground to record the aquifer nmr data two noise cancellation loops of the same size were also spread at 52 m distance from the surface of the main loop in the direction of possible electromagnetic environmental noise fig 1 aquifer soil samples were collected for particle size distribution and sieve analysis in the laboratory please insert fig 1 2 2 background of the surface nmr the measurable surface nmr signals developed due to the secondary magnetic field by pulsing a strong oscillating current in surface coils the magnetization perturbed out of equilibrium along the earth s magnetic field to the transverse direction of a signal component bloch 1946 developed an equation for the perturbation of magnetization the relaxation term in the below equation is responsible for perturbed magnetization back into the equilibrium 1 d m dt γ m b eff m x t 2 x m y t 2 y m 2 m 0 t 1 z where m is the magnetization and m x m y m z are the components of the magnetization in the x y z directions b eff is the effective earth s magnetic field t 2 t 1 are the transverse and longitudinal relaxation time vista clara inc developed commercially available multi channel surface nmr equipment to increase the applicability of surface nmr measurements this equipment was named geomri but later changed into the gmr walsh 2008 it suppressed noise to a greater extent than the single channel surface nmr equipment 2 3 surface nmr measurements the earth s static and energizing magnetic fields are weak for surface nmr applications in comparison with the laboratory nmr and borehole nmr experiments the surface nmr signals are very small nano volt therefore a large aquifer volume must be energized to record sufficient signals advanced processing software such as gmr qc must reduce electromagnetic and environmental noise after those subsurface spins get excited the current pulse passes through the surface transmitter loop to generate the excitation pulse the applied pulse is tuned at the local larmor frequency and it generates the corresponding magnetic field whose direction and intensity depend on the loop configuration and electrical resistivity of the aquifer material energizing the magnetic field weekend with the increase in aquifer depth therefore spins are energized well up to the depth 2 3 times the loop diameter after the energizing pulse is turned off the signal propagates in the aquifer and is measured using a surface receiver loop this measured signal is the superposition of all precessing nuclear spins hertrich 2008 mueller petke and yaramanci 2010 suggested the general equation for the induced voltage in the receiver loop 2 v q t g r q w r t 2 e t t 2 d

loop configuration i e the same loop for transmitting the energizing pulse and receiving the nmr signal the kernel function for one dimensional horizontal stratified subsurface is given below 4 g r q ω l m 0 s i n γ q i 0 b t r 2 i 0 b t r e 2 i ξ t r ω l the induced surface nmr voltage v q t is the function of pulse moment and time the kernel function g r q is the function of the pulse moment and position vector the partial water content w z t 2 is the function of the position vector and transverse relaxation time 2 4 the free induction decay fid the fid is the standard measurement of the surface nmr which involves the measured nmr signals following the excitation pulse the effective relaxation time is the time dependence parameter of the fid as given below 5a 1 t 2 1 t 2 b 1 t 2 s 1 t 2 i h 5b 1 t 2 1 t 2 b 1 t 2 s where t 2 is the transverse relaxation time t 2 b is the transverse bulk relaxation time t 2 s is the transverse surface relaxation time t 2 i h is the dephasing relaxation time the transverse relaxation time describes the nmr signal losses due to bulk and surface relaxation time and it is linked with the pore geometry of the subsurface brownstein and tarr 1979 the signal loss is due to the dephasing of nmr signals in the presence of the inhomogeneous static magnetic field chen et al 2005 grunewald and knight 2011 inhomogeneity in the static magnetic field is responsible for spatially varying larmor frequency it leads the magnetization at different locations to dephase and accumulates the relative phase with respect to another 2 5 empirical equations for estimation of hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity is the function of soil properties and other governing factors such as porosity pore grain size distribution the shape of pores specific surfaces and tortuosity a generalized relationship of the empirical equation between intrinsic permeability and grain size is given below bear 1972 6 k f 1 s f 2 n d e 2 the hydraulic conductivity and intrinsic permeability are related as follows bear 1972 7a k k g ν 7b k g ν f 1 s f 2 n d e 2 where k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity d e is the effective particle size of the soil and ν is the kinematic viscosity this study uses eight different empirical equations to estimate hydraulic conductivity from grain size and porosity these empirical equations cover a wide range of approaches corresponding to porosity and grain size table 1 the beta coefficient of each empirical equation was adjusted to obtain the linear equation with a unit slope thus hydraulic conductivity is represented by an offset of estimated hydraulic conductivity the correlation coefficients have analyzed the efficiency and performance and root mean square a relationship between hydraulic conductivity and aquifer soil and fluid physical properties is known as the kozeny carman equation it was first proposed by kozeny 1927 after being modified by carman 1956 carman 1938 the kozeny carman equation is applicable for sandy soils to predict hydraulic conductivity but cannot be applicable to clayey soils lambe and whitman 1991 some of the researchers validated this equation for both sandy and clayey soils 2 6 particle size analysis of aquifer soil a borewell was drilled to collect the soil samples at different depths such as 500 mm 1000 mm 1500 mm 2000 mm 2500 mm etc and a 200gm representative soil sample was taken for particle size distribution analysis this sample was thoroughly washed with water over 75 μ sieve and retained soil mass kept in the oven for 24 h the sieve analysis of the soil sample was carried out with the utilization of a set of sieves i e 0 425 m m 0 212 m m 0 15 m m 0 075 m m and a pan it separated the soil particles from larger to smaller and retained soil mass on each sieve was collected and weighed the soil can be classified based on the soil particle size and the unified soil classification system uscs further a soil analysis can be done by a grain sized distribution curve fig 2 the effective size d 10 coefficient of uniformity c u and coefficient of gradation c c parameters can be estimated from this curve as given in fig 2 8 c u d 60 d 10 a n d c c d 30 2 d 60 d 10 for gravels 1 c c 3 and c u 4 and sands 1 c c 3 and c u 6 2 7 performance evaluation of empirical equations the performance calculations of the hydraulic conductivity from the particle size distribution can be a laborious and tedious process and selections of the empirical equation are critical to the entire analysis a series of eight empirical equations table 1 were used to estimate hydraulic conductivity from particle size distributions through spreadsheet programs the performance of each empirical equation was assessed through the root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient pearson s r and coefficient of determination r 2 the correlation coefficient and r 2 can be evaluated using the following equation 9 r 1 n i 1 n x i x y i y 1 n i 1 n x i x 2 1 n i 1 n y i y 2 10 r 2 1 i n x i y i 2 i n y i x 2 the correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination determine how well hydraulic conductivity of empirical equations correlates with the surface nmr hydraulic conductivity it showed the degree to which these two variables are directly related when the values of these coefficients are very close to unity then results will be highly accepted while close to zero considered an incompetent result rmse reports the estimated competence of the empirical equation and it gauges close the estimates of hydraulic conductivity to the surface nmr hydraulic conductivity rmse is estimated by the following equation 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 3 results and discussion hydraulic conductivity is a complex property of the aquifer system and it depends on the shape and size of the pores and the viscosity of the fluid these properties control the groundwater movement in the aquifer and the shape and size of the aquifer s pores are influenced by the particle size distribution shape and density due to the complex nature and dependence of the above factors it is impossible to develop an empirical equation that can explain the predicted aquifer hydraulic conductivity values with 100 accuracy the hydraulic conductivity has been calculated with eight empirical equations and a short description of the equations is presented in table 2 the empirical equations used the aquifer grain size and porosity but the void ratio was used in the navfac dm7 instead of porosity the porosities along the depth were calculated non invasively using surface nmr experimentation and grain size distribution analysis was carried out in the laboratory the effective particle size d 10 0 5155 m m d 30 1 518 m m a n d d 60 1 991 m m of the aquifer soil samples were estimated from the particle size distribution curve fig 2 based on particle size distribution it can be concluded that the aquifer majorly contains sandy materials the eight empirical equations used the particle size distribution and surface nmr porosity to estimate hydraulic conductivity initially original equations were used i e without modification the estimated hydraulic conductivities and surface nmr hydraulic conductivity are shown in fig 3 the correlation analysis was performed assuming a linear relation between observed surface nmr and estimated hydraulic conductivities the pearson s r and r 2 were obtained for each empirical equation and analyzed without removing any data set generally the original empirical equation showed low correlation coefficients e g rosas et al 2015 similarly this study also showed that low correlation coefficients were found for original equations such as slitcher r 0 469 r 2 0 219 sauebrei r 0 545 r 2 0 297 navfac dm7 r 0 558 r 2 0 308 and kruger r 0 554 r 2 0 307 while moderate correlation coefficients were found for kozeny carman k c r 0 741 r 2 0 549 hazen r 0 756 r 2 0 541 zamarin r 0 697 r 2 0 486 and terzaghi r 0 644 r 2 0 414 the best correlated empirical equations were selected based on the pearson s r r 2 and rmse values a 45 slope line is drawn from the origin for estimation of the underestimated overestimated and overlapped percentage of the data the underestimated overestimated and overlapped percentages of data for kozeny carman terzaghi hazen slitcher kruger sauebrei navfcdm7 and zamarin are 52 35 15 47 38 15 50 32 18 61 24 15 54 35 9 41 41 18 64 30 6 and 53 44 3 respectively fig 4 a h we adjusted the coefficients of the empirical equations in order to obtain linear relation with the unit slope thus a modified beta coefficient and offset constants were obtained for each empirical equation we analyzed the data set for empirical equations and identified that the effective diameter d 10 holds the best linear relation rmse estimate to the modified empirical equation showed significant improvement over the original empirical equations but some of the equations have approximate same rmse in both cases table 2 the rmse for each equation has less than 10 thus all equations can be used for a reliable estimate of saturated hydraulic conductivity some of the equations such as kozeny carman and zamarin were consistent with original and modified coefficients modified empirical equation hydraulic conductivity estimates are closer to the surface nmr hydraulic conductivity because of the modified empirical coefficient in the empirical equation and offset constant fig 5 the estimated aquifer hydraulic conductivity pattern was almost similar to the observed surface nmr hydraulic conductivity and the error of the modified equations was also in an acceptable range each modified empirical equation showed high pearson s r and r 2 correlation coefficients as compared with the original empirical equations modified slitcher r 0 902 r 2 0 814 kruger r 0 957 r 2 0 913 sauebrei r 0 946 r 2 0 895 and navfac dm7 r 0 931 r 2 0 864 showed a significantly high correlation compared with the original form of the empirical equation fig 6 a h some of the empirical equations performed well in the original form and the modified form showed high correlation coefficients such as kozeny carman r 0 951 r 2 0 904 hazen r 0 954 r 2 0 910 and zamarin r 0 952 r 2 0 907 the particle size distribution of the aquifer samples has been used for the estimation of hydraulic conductivity using various empirical equations this study reveals that each empirical equation yields different hydraulic conductivity compared to the surface nmr hydraulic conductivity the statistical accuracy of all eight empirical equations was assessed and it was found that each equation has different accuracy some of them showed more accurate hydraulic conductivity estimates than others and the original form of the empirical equation had low correlation coefficients and a high degree of error the beta coefficient β of each equation was adjusted in such a way as to create a linear relationship between the estimated empirical equation hydraulic conductivities and observed surface nmr hydraulic conductivity the offset obtained from the original equations was corrected to modify the estimates of the empirical equations this modification improves the performance and accuracy of the empirical equation in the study area surface nmr is an in situ and non invasive hydrogeological and hydrogeophysical exploration method the field experiment setup has four units frequency tuning unit surface nmr signal transmitter receiver unit control unit with a data recorder laptop and power source unit the surface nmr signals are transmitted and received through the coincident main wire loops fig 1 on the other hand borewell nmr experiments can be performed through the borewell with a certain depth and diameter the main advantage associated with the surface nmr is that the field experiments can be performed where sufficient plain horizontal space is available to lay down the main and noise cancellation wire loops the disadvantage is the presence of electromagnetic and environmental noise in the study area leads to an increase in the noise level in the collected data however the noise cancellation wire loops can reduce the noise level up to a certain extent generally we avoid high noise level sites for surface nmr because it affects the quality and resolution of the surface nmr data 4 conclusions the present study indicates that empirical equations provide a less accurate estimate of the saturated aquifer hydraulic conductivity than the modified empirical equations this was found to be the case after comparing the two sets of equations evaluation of the statistical performance and significance of each empirical equation was carried out so that the estimation might be improved in order to get the linear equation of the unit slope we adjusted the beta coefficient first this allowed us to get a more precise estimate of the hydraulic conductivity based on the results of the above analysis following conclusions of the study are summarized below 1 the particle size distribution curve indicates that the study area s aquifer

time some empirical methods overestimated and underestimated hydraulic conductivity odong 2007 song et al 2009 verified the hydraulic conductivity estimated from the particle size distribution and permeameter for elkhorn river soil samples nebraska empirical methods showed larger values compared to permeameter values and five empirical equations have 3 6 times larger hydraulic conductivity than the laboratory values ishaku et al 2011 used empirical equations to estimate aquifer hydraulic conductivity in the jimeta yola study site terzaghi equation was found to be the best estimator of hydraulic conductivity followed by the kozeny carman equation devlin 2015 developed hydrogeosievexl an excel based spreadsheet application that calculates hydraulic conductivity from grain size distribution curves using 15 different empirical equations rosas et al 2015 collected 39 sediment soil samples from ephemeral streams in saudi arabia the porosity grain size distribution and hydraulic conductivity were estimated for all laboratory samples and empirical equations were also used to estimate hydraulic conductivity most of the empirical equations were poorly correlated with observed laboratory data modified empirical equations showed significant improvement in the estimation of hydraulic conductivity hwang et al 2017 compared hydraulic conductivities of the coarse medium and fine grained sand with the help of empirical equations a relative porosity model and breakthrough curve analysis kango et al 2019 studied the effects of soil grains on aquifer hydraulic conductivity they filled marble chips in the natural borehole and maintained a laminar flow regime to develop a power model khalil and monterio santos 2009 analyzed the groundwater saturation relation with aquifer resistivity and hydraulic conductivity from kozeny carman kc and archie s second law they concluded their finding in three relations an inverse power relation for saturated aquifer when porosity is the same as water saturation an inverse polynomial relation for the unsaturated aquifer and direct relation for the poorly saturated aquifer several hydrological methods are used to estimate hydraulic conductivity in groundwater aquifers these methods can provide hydraulic conductivity within the study area however some of these methods have been applied with limitations butler 2005 chen et al 2012 ren et al 2016 suggested a new hydraulic conductivity void ratio equation based on poiseuille s law this equation showed improved hydraulic conductivity estimation over the classical kozeny carman equation shahbazi et al 2020 used an empirical equation to establish the relationship between permeability and depth and it was compared with the analytical results ganiyu et al 2020 collected twelve soil samples from oyo state nigeria to analyze all soil parameters based on standard procedure these parameters predicted the saturated hydraulic conductivity water content etc were predicted based on these parameters the nuclear magnetic resonance nmr technique is used in hydro geophysics geophysics and hydrological research areas for surface laboratory and logging applications nmr has direct sensitivity to water molecules hydrogen proton therefore structural properties of the aquifer such as porosity hydraulic conductivity and pore size distribution can be estimated kenyon 1997 sen et al 1990 straley et al 1997 müller et al 2005 performed laboratory experiments to verify the hydraulic conductivity estimated from surface nmr and particle size distribution the laboratory data were also compared to assess the scaling effect in surface nmr data they concluded that the surface nmr data was suitable for predicting hydraulic conductivity in sandy silty and clayey aquifer materials ioannidis et al 2006 studied the gravity driven drainage initially proposed by chen et al 1994 based on their observations relative hydraulic conductivity is directly related to the nmr relaxation time at different saturation levels yaramanci and müller petke 2009 stated that the surface nmr is the only geophysical exploration technique that non invasively collects the aquifer properties knight et al 2012 used surface nmr to explore groundwater aquifer properties and estimate hydraulic conductivity using the link between nmr relaxation data and the geometry of pore spaces dlubac et al 2013 used proton nuclear magnetic resonance nmr logging at lexington site nebraska to estimate pore spaces aquifer porosity and geometry both parameters can be used for the estimation of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity ren et al 2019 used the nmr logging method for quick estimation of hydraulic conductivity with high vertical resolution they interpreted nmr logging data to calibrate an empirical equation to transform borehole data into hydraulic conductivity in hydro geophysical applications permeability is often replaced with hydraulic conductivity because it is integrated with fluid properties such as density and viscosity the surface nmr was primarily applied on sandstones however unconsolidated material is more prevalent in the aquifer than the sandstones dlugosch et al 2013 formulated the kozeny godefroy model which is based on material pore size and bulk water relaxation the bulk water relaxation can significantly affect the nmr measurements in coarse material maurer and knight 2016 used an empirical model along with three other models to analyze the hydraulic conductivity based on nmr data the selected model did not show any improvement in hydraulic conductivity results zhang et al 2018 surface nmr technique was used to estimate the effect of saturated hydraulic conductivity on landslide mass in the three gorges reservoir area they obtained a series of reliable data with the calibration of field measurements teng et al 2019 used the nmr technique to measure pore size distribution and saturated hydraulic conductivity estimation in saturated clayey soil samples static compaction consolidation and proctor compaction methods were adopted for soil sample preparation spurlin et al 2019 conducted several field nmr experiments to investigate water content and hydraulic conductivity the nmr measurements were compared with the cone penetrometer testing data singh et al 2021 carried out several surface nmr experiments to categorize the geophysical strata and it was compared with the nearby borehole data skibbe et al 2020 used a python toolbox coupled with electrical resistivity tomography and magnetic resonance for inversion and complex surface nmr data modeling this technique only allowed variation in one or two dimensions of their parameters mazzilli et al 2020 applied surface nmr to monitor the unsaturated karst zone of the aquifer in southern france their findings demonstrated the efficiency and applicability of this technique in the infiltration dynamics of karst s unsaturated aquifer apart from the above studies on empirical equation hydraulic conductivities researchers carman 1956 carman 1937 hazen 1892 slichter 1899 terzaghi 1925 kozeny 1927 vukovic and soro 1992 chesnaux et al 2011 lu et al 2012 have investigated for the different types of soils this provides the basis of the present study to understand how empirical equation hydraulic conductivities are related to the surface nmr hydraulic conductivity the developed modified empirical equations can be used for similar types of subsurface geological sites this study is carried out to address the following research questions 1 how does the empirical equation of hydraulic conductivities related to the surface nmr hydraulic conductivity 2 how many percentage values are under and overestimated with respect to the 1 1 line 45 line from origin 3 can the modified β coefficients enhance the performance of the empirical equations in this study a borewell was excavated and soil samples were collected at different depths a representative soil sample was considered for sieve analysis and particle size distribution in the laboratory the surface nmr field experiments were carried out near the borewell and gmr qc software was used to record the surface nmr data afterward surface nmr data was processed through gmr 1d inversion software eight empirical equations were used to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity based on the aquifer s particle size distribution and porosity these estimated hydraulic conductivities were compared with the surface nmr hydraulic conductivity to improve the performance accuracy of each empirical equation beta coefficient was modified to obtain the linear equation with unit slope 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the study area was located at the foothill of the himalayan range in the southwestern part of uttrakhand state india both surface nmr field experiments and a borehole were drilled at the study site the local earth s magnetic field 49308 2 n t magnetic inclination 47 3215 0 and magnetic declination 1 4043 0 were measured during the experiment using a magnetometer to avoid temporal and spatial errors the local coordinates of the survey site are 29 54 12 3 n and 77 57 26 6 e respectively a 26 m diameter wire of the main loop was spread on the ground to record the aquifer nmr data two noise cancellation loops of the same size were also spread at 52 m distance from the surface of the main loop in the direction of possible electromagnetic environmental noise fig 1 aquifer soil samples were collected for particle size distribution and sieve analysis in the laboratory please insert fig 1 2 2 background of the surface nmr the measurable surface nmr signals developed due to the secondary magnetic field by pulsing a strong oscillating current in surface coils the magnetization perturbed out of equilibrium along the earth s magnetic field to the transverse direction of a signal component bloch 1946 developed an equation for the perturbation of magnetization the relaxation term in the below equation is responsible for perturbed magnetization back into the equilibrium 1 d m dt γ m b eff m x t 2 x m y t 2 y m 2 m 0 t 1 z where m is the magnetization and m x m y m z are the components of the magnetization in the x y z directions b eff is the effective earth s magnetic field t 2 t 1 are the transverse and longitudinal relaxation time vista clara inc developed commercially available multi channel surface nmr equipment to increase the applicability of surface nmr measurements this equipment was named geomri but later changed into the gmr walsh 2008 it suppressed noise to a greater extent than the single channel surface nmr equipment 2 3 surface nmr measurements the earth s static and energizing magnetic fields are weak for surface nmr applications in comparison with the laboratory nmr and borehole nmr experiments the surface nmr signals are very small nano volt therefore a large aquifer volume must be energized to record sufficient signals advanced processing software such as gmr qc must reduce electromagnetic and environmental noise after those subsurface spins get excited the current pulse passes through the surface transmitter loop to generate the excitation pulse the applied pulse is tuned at the local larmor frequency and it generates the corresponding magnetic field whose direction and intensity depend on the loop configuration and electrical resistivity of the aquifer material energizing the magnetic field weekend with the increase in aquifer depth therefore spins are energized well up to the depth 2 3 times the loop diameter after the energizing pulse is turned off the signal propagates in the aquifer and is measured using a surface receiver loop this measured signal is the superposition of all precessing nuclear spins hertrich 2008 mueller petke and yaramanci 2010 suggested the general equation for the induced voltage in the receiver loop 2 v q t g r q w r t 2 e t t 2 d

relaxation time the transverse relaxation time describes the nmr signal losses due to bulk and surface relaxation time and it is linked with the pore geometry of the subsurface brownstein and tarr 1979 the signal loss is due to the dephasing of nmr signals in the presence of the inhomogeneous static magnetic field chen et al 2005 grunewald and knight 2011 inhomogeneity in the static magnetic field is responsible for spatially varying larmor frequency it leads the magnetization at different locations to dephase and accumulates the relative phase with respect to another 2 5 empirical equations for estimation of hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity is the function of soil properties and other governing factors such as porosity pore grain size distribution the shape of pores specific surfaces and tortuosity a generalized relationship of the empirical equation between intrinsic permeability and grain size is given below bear 1972 6 k f 1 s f 2 n d e 2 the hydraulic conductivity and intrinsic permeability are related as follows bear 1972 7a k k g ν 7b k g ν f 1 s f 2 n d e 2 where k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity d e is the effective particle size of the soil and ν is the kinematic viscosity this study uses eight different empirical equations to estimate hydraulic conductivity from grain size and porosity these empirical equations cover a wide range of approaches corresponding to porosity and grain size table 1 the beta coefficient of each empirical equation was adjusted to obtain the linear equation with a unit slope thus hydraulic conductivity is represented by an offset of estimated hydraulic conductivity the correlation coefficients have analyzed the efficiency and performance and root mean square a relationship between hydraulic conductivity and aquifer soil and fluid physical properties is known as the kozeny carman equation it was first proposed by kozeny 1927 after being modified by carman 1956 carman 1938 the kozeny carman equation is applicable for sandy soils to predict hydraulic conductivity but cannot be applicable to clayey soils lambe and whitman 1991 some of the researchers validated this equation for both sandy and clayey soils 2 6 particle size analysis of aquifer soil a borewell was drilled to collect the soil samples at different depths such as 500 mm 1000 mm 1500 mm 2000 mm 2500 mm etc and a 200gm representative soil sample was taken for particle size distribution analysis this sample was thoroughly washed with water over 75 μ sieve and retained soil mass kept in the oven for 24 h the sieve analysis of the soil sample was carried out with the utilization of a set of sieves i e 0 425 m m 0 212 m m 0 15 m m 0 075 m m and a pan it separated the soil particles from larger to smaller and retained soil mass on each sieve was collected and weighed the soil can be classified based on the soil particle size and the unified soil classification system uscs further a soil analysis can be done by a grain sized distribution curve fig 2 the effective size d 10 coefficient of uniformity c u and coefficient of gradation c c parameters can be estimated from this curve as given in fig 2 8 c u d 60 d 10 a n d c c d 30 2 d 60 d 10 for gravels 1 c c 3 and c u 4 and sands 1 c c 3 and c u 6 2 7 performance evaluation of empirical equations the performance calculations of the hydraulic conductivity from the particle size distribution can be a laborious and tedious process and selections of the empirical equation are critical to the entire analysis a series of eight empirical equations table 1 were used to estimate hydraulic conductivity from particle size distributions through spreadsheet programs the performance of each empirical equation was assessed through the root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient pearson s r and coefficient of determination r 2 the correlation coefficient and r 2 can be evaluated using the following equation 9 r 1 n i 1 n x i x y i y 1 n i 1 n x i x 2 1 n i 1 n y i y 2 10 r 2 1 i n x i y i 2 i n y i x 2 the correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination determine how well hydraulic conductivity of empirical equations correlates with the surface nmr hydraulic conductivity it showed the degree to which these two variables are directly related when the values of these coefficients are very close to unity then results will be highly accepted while close to zero considered an incompetent result rmse reports the estimated competence of the empirical equation and it gauges close the estimates of hydraulic conductivity to the surface nmr hydraulic conductivity rmse is estimated by the following equation 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 3 results and discussion hydraulic conductivity is a complex property of the aquifer system and it depends on the shape and size of the pores and the viscosity of the fluid these properties control the groundwater movement in the aquifer and the shape and size of the aquifer s pores are influenced by the particle size distribution shape and density due to the complex nature and dependence of the above factors it is impossible to develop an empirical equation that can explain the predicted aquifer hydraulic conductivity values with 100 accuracy the hydraulic conductivity has been calculated with eight empirical equations and a short description of the equations is presented in table 2 the empirical equations used the aquifer grain size and porosity but the void ratio was used in the navfac dm7 instead of porosity the porosities along the depth were calculated non invasively using surface nmr experimentation and grain size distribution analysis was carried out in the laboratory the effective particle size d 10 0 5155 m m d 30 1 518 m m a n d d 60 1 991 m m of the aquifer soil samples were estimated from the particle size distribution curve fig 2 based on particle size distribution it can be concluded that the aquifer majorly contains sandy materials the eight empirical equations used the particle size distribution and surface nmr porosity to estimate hydraulic conductivity initially original equations were used i e without modification the estimated hydraulic conductivities and surface nmr hydraulic conductivity are shown in fig 3 the correlation analysis was performed assuming a linear relation between observed surface nmr and estimated hydraulic conductivities the pearson s r and r 2 were obtained for each empirical equation and analyzed without removing any data set generally the original empirical equation showed low correlation coefficients e g rosas et al 2015 similarly this study also showed that low correlation coefficients were found for original equations such as slitcher r 0 469 r 2 0 219 sauebrei r 0 545 r 2 0 297 navfac dm7 r 0 558 r 2 0 308 and kruger r 0 554 r 2 0 307 while moderate correlation coefficients were found for kozeny carman k c r 0 741 r 2 0 549 hazen r 0 756 r 2 0 541 zamarin r 0 697 r 2 0 486 and terzaghi r 0 644 r 2 0 414 the best correlated empirical equations were selected based on the pearson s r r 2 and rmse values a 45 slope line is drawn from the origin for estimation of the underestimated overestimated and overlapped percentage of the data the underestimated overestimated and overlapped percentages of data for kozeny carman terzaghi hazen slitcher kruger sauebrei navfcdm7 and zamarin are 52 35 15 47 38 15 50 32 18 61 24 15 54 35 9 41 41 18 64 30 6 and 53 44 3 respectively fig 4 a h we adjusted the coefficients of the empirical equations in order to obtain linear relation with the unit slope thus a modified beta coefficient and offset constants were obtained for each empirical equation we analyzed the data set for empirical equations and identified that the effective diameter d 10 holds the best linear relation rmse estimate to the modified empirical equation showed significant improvement over the original empirical equations but some of the equations have approximate same rmse in both cases table 2 the rmse for each equation has less than 10 thus all equations can be used for a reliable estimate of saturated hydraulic conductivity some of the equations such as kozeny carman and zamarin were consistent with original and modified coefficients modified empirical equation hydraulic conductivity estimates are closer to the surface nmr hydraulic conductivity because of the modified empirical coefficient in the empirical equation and offset constant fig 5 the estimated aquifer hydraulic conductivity pattern was almost similar to the observed surface nmr hydraulic conductivity and the error of the modified equations was also in an acceptable range each modified empirical equation showed high pearson s r and r 2 correlation coefficients as compared with the original empirical equations modified slitcher r 0 902 r 2 0 814 kruger r 0 957 r 2 0 913 sauebrei r 0 946 r 2 0 895 and navfac dm7 r 0 931 r 2 0 864 showed a significantly high correlation compared with the original form of the empirical equation fig 6 a h some of the empirical equations performed well in the original form and the modified form showed high correlation coefficients such as kozeny carman r 0 951 r 2 0 904 hazen r 0 954 r 2 0 910 and zamarin r 0 952 r 2 0 907 the particle size distribution of the aquifer samples has been used for the estimation of hydraulic conductivity using various empirical equations this study reveals that each empirical equation yields different hydraulic conductivity compared to the surface nmr hydraulic conductivity the statistical accuracy of all eight empirical equations was assessed and it was found that each equation has different accuracy some of them showed more accurate hydraulic conductivity estimates than others and the original form of the empirical equation had low correlation coefficients and a high degree of error the beta coefficient β of each equation was adjusted in such a way as to create a linear relationship between the estimated empirical equation hydraulic conductivities and observed surface nmr hydraulic conductivity the offset obtained from the original equations was corrected to modify the estimates of the empirical equations this modification improves the performance and accuracy of the empirical equation in the study area surface nmr is an in situ and non invasive hydrogeological and hydrogeophysical exploration method the field experiment setup has four units frequency tuning unit surface nmr signal transmitter receiver unit control unit with a data recorder laptop and power source unit the surface nmr signals are transmitted and received through the coincident main wire loops fig 1 on the other hand borewell nmr experiments can be performed through the borewell with a certain depth and diameter the main advantage associated with the surface nmr is that the field experiments can be performed where sufficient plain horizontal space is available to lay down the main and noise cancellation wire loops the disadvantage is the presence of electromagnetic and environmental noise in the study area leads to an increase in the noise level in the collected data however the noise cancellation wire loops can reduce the noise level up to a certain extent generally we avoid high noise level sites for surface nmr because it affects the quality and resolution of the surface nmr data 4 conclusions the present study indicates that empirical equations provide a less accurate estimate of the saturated aquifer hydraulic conductivity than the modified empirical equations this was found to be the case after comparing the two sets of equations evaluation of the statistical performance and significance of each empirical equation was carried out so that the estimation might be improved in order to get the linear equation of the unit slope we adjusted the beta coefficient first this allowed us to get a more precise estimate of the hydraulic conductivity based on the results of the above analysis following conclusions of the study are summarized below 1 the particle size distribution curve indicates that the study area s aquifer

2396,peak discharge in rivers mostly varies depending on spatiotemporal characteristics of the rainfall even with the same total rainfall amount however the spatiotemporal patterns of heavy rainfall such as rainfall levels used for river planning are difficult to determine due to the limited number of rainfall observations we propose a spatiotemporal classification method for massive ensemble rainfall datasets produced through dynamical downscaling with a regional climate model to clarify the possible rainfall patterns this classification method was applied to several hundred heavy rainfall events from the massive ensemble climate dataset corresponding to identical exceedance probabilities within a given statistical confidence interval i e 95 confidence interval of the 150 year return period in the probability limit test the new classification method detected spatiotemporal rainfall patterns affecting peak discharges in the main river and tributaries within the target basin these classified rainfall patterns can be used to investigate damage scenarios in the target basin which are difficult to determine from the observed rainfall patterns as a result the proposed method with the massive ensemble climate dataset will contribute to flood control planning keywords spatial temporal pattern heavy rainfall classification hierarchical cluster analysis d4pdf climate change 1 introduction to take countermeasures against disasters caused by heavy rainfall it is necessary to estimate possible damage patterns of a river basin characteristics of heavy rainfall disasters are strongly influenced by the spatiotemporal patterns as well as the amounts of rainfall for example the location and intensity of damage within a river basin and the pattern of damage flooding from rivers flooding from inland waters sediment related disasters etc vary depending on the spatiotemporal distribution of the rainfall therefore to realize effective flood control measures it is important to understand the various spatiotemporal patterns of rainfall that can occur in river basins and to develop countermeasures based on the characteristics of the hazards associated with each rainfall pattern climate change is projected to increase the unevenness in the distribution of rainfall amounts while increasing the frequency and amount of heavy rainfall in some areas ipcc 2021 disasters caused by heavy rainfall are expected to become increasingly severe and frequent in japan e g yamada 2019 mext and jma 2020 moe 2020 in hokkaido the northern island of japan heavy rainfall events due to a series of four typhoons over 2 weeks resulted in flooding and sediment related disasters in august 2016 in response the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit and hokkaido prefecture began to consider a flood control plan that accounts for the impact of climate change yamada 2019 with this new flood control plan the differences in flood risk due to the amounts and patterns of rainfall at the river basin scale were thoroughly discussed thus the spatiotemporal patterns of the rainfall as well as changes in the rainfall amount are considered when planning adaptation measures to climate change several previous studies have examined the impact of the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall on the flood hydrologic response e g krajewski et al 1991 nicotina et al 2008 viglione et al 2010 paschalis et al 2014 zhu et al 2018 most previous studies used hydrological models with observed rainfall data or spatiotemporal rainfall distributions generated by rainfall generators based on the monte carlo method the studies aimed to elucidate the influence of spatiotemporal variability of rainfall on flooding based on the effects of the topographic characteristics of the river basin such as the catchment size however the impact of the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall on flooding has not been clear yet some studies concluded conflicting findings regarding the relative importance of spatial and temporal rainfall resolution e g zhu et al 2018 most previous studies are based on the limited number of target catchments and rainfall patterns cristiano et al 2017 which may cause vague understanding in addition although both the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall and the topographic features of the river basin determine characteristics of flooding the typical rainfall patterns that can occur in a river basin have not been adequately investigated therefore patterns of damage caused by possible heavy rainfall cannot be sufficiently foreseen in recent years ensemble climate databases e g mizuta et al 2017 fujita et al 2019 have been used to assess the impact of climate change at the regional scale e g yamada 2019 ishii and mori 2020 the probability of the occurrence of extremely heavy rainfall possible flood disasters and of future change can be estimated based on thousands of heavy rainfall events in a large climate database yamada 2019 numerous rainfall events in large climate databases can be used to detect possible spatiotemporal rainfall patterns over river basins under past and future climates the influence of such rainfall patterns on the type and magnitude of flood damage can also be estimated comprehensively however due to the large number of rainfall events included in the climate databases classification of rainfall patterns using appropriate clustering methods is important to estimate damage scenarios and plan flood control in a basin this need has recently emerged based on the availability of ensemble climate data containing thousands of years of heavy rainfall events the development of a spatiotemporal pattern classification method for heavy rainfall and its application to ensemble climate data will significantly contribute to the detection of possible disaster scenarios and the development of new flood control measures in this study we propose a method of classifying rainfall events based on spatiotemporal rainfall patterns to enable the identification of representative heavy rainfall patterns with characteristic hydrograph features such as peak discharge the newly developed classification method was applied to hundreds of heavy rainfall events over the tokachi river basin in the ensemble climate dataset the remainder of this paper proceeds as follows the methodology of rainfall pattern classification is introduced in section 2 the target basin and rainfall data for classification are described in section 3 the clustering results are presented in section 4 and the study is summarized in section 5 2 methodology the framework of the rainfall pattern classification method proposed in this study is shown in fig 1 the input data for classification comprise time series of gridded rainfall data covering a target catchment area all target rainfall events must have the same time and space resolution the method classifies rainfall events separately in terms of temporal and spatial aspects hereinafter temporal classification and spatial classification respectively for both temporal and spatial classification rainfall events are classified by hierarchical cluster analysis kaufman et al 1990 based on similarities between all pairs of rainfall events in terms of their temporal and spatial patterns respectively calculated using the definitions below for spatiotemporal classification rainfall events are classified based on the results of both temporal and spatial rainfall classifications the details of each process are described below the source code of the classification is provided in appendix a 2 1 temporal classification for temporal classification rainfall data is at first converted into area averaged time series rainfall hyetograph over the entire target basin using the following equation 1 r t t p 1 p num r t p p num where t is time p is a spatial point in the target basin p num is the number of p r is rainfall intensity as a function of t and p and r t is a time series of area averaged rainfall intensity hyetograph in the target basin next the starting and ending times of the target rainfall events t sta and t end respectively are determined as the timing of the rainfall amount during the target rainfall duration t p becomes maximum t p is a given value e g 72 h t sta and t end must follow t end t sta t p this preparation is done for all target rainfall events the similarities of all pairs of rainfall events are then quantified from the hyetographs as distances here we show the methodology for calculation of the distance between two rainfall events i and j event as an example the distance calculation consists of 4 steps fig 2 in the first step the differences δ r for each time step between the two hyetographs are calculated using eqs 2 and 3 2 δ r i j t t r t i t sta i t r t j t sta j t t 3 δ r j i t t r t j t sta j t r t i t sta i t t where t is the variable for iterative calculation t t d t d 1 t d 1 t d t d is the permissible time difference described below subscripts i and j indicate rainfall events e g t sta i and t sta j indicate area averaged hourly rainfall intensity of the i and the j event respectively the permissible time difference t d which is a given value e g 24 h is used in eqs 2 and 3 to reduce the excessive influence of small rainfall events occurring before and after periods of intense rainfall events a schematic diagram of the calculation of δ r i j is shown in fig 3 the example of calculation δ r i j under the condition of t d 0 equivalent to not considering the permissible time difference is shown in fig 3a in this case the distance appears significant although the shapes of the hydrographs during the intense rainfall periods are similar such apparently significant differences arise due to the selected target period which frequently includes light rainfall before and after the intense rainfall period therefore in this study the permissible time difference t d is used to calculate the distance emphasizing the similarity of shapes of intense rainfall the example of calculation δ r i j under the condition of t 2 is shown in fig 3b in this case the distance for temporal classification between the two rainfall events defined later is determined under this condition t 2 because the difference is smallest when t 2 due to introduction of the permissible time difference the two differences δ r i j t t and δ r j i t t are not equal if t d 0 δ r i j t t and δ r j i t t are completely same in the second step root mean square errors rmses of r t i and r t j for each t are calculated using eqs 4 and 5 4 δ r i j t 1 t p t 0 t p 1 δ r i j t t 2 5 δ r j i t 1 t p t 0 t p 1 δ r j i t t 2 where δ r i j t and δ r j i t are rmses based on eqs 2 and 3 respectively δ r i j t and δ r j i t are calculated for each t between t d and t d in the third step the total distances t dist i and t dist j are obtained from δ r i

the distance in terms of temporal rainfall pattern between i and j event t dist i j is defined as the minimum value of t dist i i j and t dist j i j the distances for all pairs of rainfall events are calculated using eqs 1 8 and converted into a distance matrix finally hierarchical cluster analysis is used to classify rainfall events based on temporal rainfall patterns from the distance matrix we selected hierarchical cluster analysis from several available classification methods because the number of clusters can be changed freely the number of clusters should be determined based on the scale of the target river or the target disaster type e g dyke breach inland flood or sediment disaster or the level of detail required by the decision makers in this study the ward method ward 1963 is used to calculate the distance between clusters in hierarchical cluster analysis 2 2 spatial classification the procedure of spatial classification is similar to that of temporal classification the only difference between the two classification methods is the definition of similarity between two rainfall events the input data for spatial classification is the spatial distribution of time integrated rainfall from t sta to t end firstly the time series of gridded rainfall data is converted into time integrated rainfall intensity for each grid point using the following equation 9 r s p t t sta t end r t p where r s is time integrated rainfall intensity as a function of the grid point the r s is calculated for all target rainfall events next the distance of the spatial rainfall pattern between two rainfall events i and j event is calculated the δ r s i j i e the differences between r s i and r s j for each grid point is calculated at all grid points using eq 10 10 δ r s i j p r s i p r s j p a schematic diagram of the calculation for δ r s i j is shown in fig 4 the total spatial difference between two events is then calculated as rmse using eq 11 11 s dist i j 1 p num p 1 p num δ r s i j p 2 where s dist i j is the distance in terms of the spatial rainfall pattern between the i and j events the s dist is calculated for all pairs of rainfall events using eqs 9 11 and is converted into a distance matrix finally the rainfall events are classified into clusters through hierarchical cluster analysis based on the distance matrix similar to the process used for temporal classification the ward method used in the temporal classification is also used for calculating the distance between clusters in hierarchical cluster analysis 2 3 spatiotemporal classification for the spatiotemporal classification as shown in fig 1 rainfall events are classified using a matrix with rows and columns corresponding to the clusters obtained from temporal and spatial classifications respectively 3 target area and dataset 3 1 tokachi river basin the developed classification method was applied to heavy rainfall events in the tokachi river basin in central hokkaido the northern island of japan fig 5 the tokachi river basin consists of the main river and three large tributaries the otofuke satsunai and toshibetsu rivers we targeted five discharge observation points designated moiwa point a located in the tokachi river 21 0 km from the outlet obihiro point b located in the tokachi river 56 7 km from the outlet otofuke point c located in the otofuke river satsunai point d located in the satsunai river and toshibetsu point e located in the toshibetsu river to clarify the relationship between classified rainfall patterns and river discharge at those five points in practice the river discharges at those points were calculated from the rating curves relation between discharge and water level which are estimated from the river channels cross sectional profiles and observed water levels and surface velocities the catchment areas of those five points hereinafter catchment a e are 8208 0 km2 2677 8 km2 707 9 km2 743 9 km2 and 2715 2 km2 respectively the observed annual maximum 72 h rainfall levels over the moiwa catchment catchment a from 1919 to 2018 were obtained from the mlit fig 6 the time scale used for river planning in this basin is 72 h based on the duration of major rainfall events in the past as peak discharge generally occurs within 72 h after the onset of rainfall therefore the target rainfall duration t p is set 72 h the permissible time difference t d is also set 72 h river discharge data from 1998 to 2018 were obtained from the mlit 3 2 d4pdf 5 5 km climate data the rainfall data were obtained from the database for policy decision making for future climate change d4pdf mizuta et al 2017 d4pdf is a massive ensemble climate experiment with spatial resolution of 20 20 km in east asia d4pdf 20 km it consists of the past experiment past exp which examined 3000 years of data i e 60 years 1951 2010 50 members using observed sea surface temperature sst data hirahara et al 2014 as the lower boundary condition and a future experiment 4 k exp assuming a 4 k increase in temperature from before the industrial revolution containing 5400 years of data i e 60 years 15 members 6 ssts in the 4 k exp six different ssts were selected from the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 in both past exp and 4 k exp the non hydrostatic regional climate model nhrcm sasaki et al 2008 was used for dynamical downscaling the total dataset representing 8400 years can be used to discuss extreme rainfall events that could occur under both past and future climate conditions with a physical basis d4pdf 20 km was dynamically downscaled to a spatial resolution of 5 5 km using the nhrcm d4pdf 5 km hoshino et al 2020 to more accurately represent intense hourly rainfall sasaki et al 2011 yamada et al 2021 here we used 8400 hourly rainfall events which are the annual maximum 72 h rainfall events over the moiwa catchment catchment a in the tokachi river basin extracted from d4pdf 5 km covering 3000 years for past exp and 5400 years for 4 k exp the frequencies of the annual maximum 72 h rainfall for the past exp and 4 k exp are shown in fig 6a the rainfall amount of the past exp shows a similar frequency distribution to the observed data in contrast rainfall in 4 k exp is much larger with 99th percentile values of the annual maximum 72 h rainfall of 227 0 mm and 299 9 mm for past exp and 4 k exp respectively 3 3 target rainfall events rainfall events at the scale of the 150 year return period which is equivalent to the target rainfall used for river planning in the tokachi river basin were subjected to classification the confidence interval of rainfall amount for each return period can be evaluated using the method based on extreme value statistical theory shimizu et al 2020a b which enabled the probability limit method test moriguti 1995 to apply hydrological frequency analysis the width of this confidence interval is completely independent of the ensemble approach fig 6b shows the amount of rainfall for each return period with confidence intervals obtained from observed annual maximum 72 h rainfall over the moiwa catchment catchment a based on 100 year observation using the statistical theory and assuming the gumbel distribution the expected value for a 150 year return period is 204 4 mm 72 h and the 95 confidence interval range is 180 0 249 1 mm 72 h we extracted rainfall events falling within the 95 confidence interval from past exp and 4 k exp as target rainfall events for pattern classification in total 571 rainfall events past exp 88 of 3000 total events 4 k exp 483 of 5400 total events satisfied this criterion fig 6a the selected rainfall events can be considered rainfall events with a 150 year return probability the proportion of events selected in the 4 k exp 483 5400 was approximately three times greater than in past exp 88 3000 this indicates that heavy rainfall at the scale of the 150 year return period under the past climate condition will become more frequent under a warmer climate 3 4 river discharges the hydrographs of the rainfall data of past exp and 4 k exp were estimated by the distributed two stage tank model and river flow simulation details are provided in text s1 to compare clustering results and characteristics of discharge at each discharge observation point in the target basin although several dams are present in the target basin we did not consider the influence of water management using dams located within the target river basin as the aim was to clarify the impact of spatiotemporal rainfall patterns on river discharge the relationship between the amount of rainfall in catchment a and peak discharge at point a e obtained from the hydrological model using all 8400 rainfall events in both the past exp and 4 k exp experiments along with observations collected between 1998 and 2018 is shown in fig 7 note that the peak discharges obtained from the hydrological model that was forced by d4pdf 5 km data are larger than the observed peaks because the model does not consider the influence of dam operations including water release and storage with the exception of point a the peak observed discharges fall within the range obtained from the hydrological model the modeled peak discharge was higher than the observed value with 140 mm or less rainfall at point a due to the effect of the dam which reduces peak discharge the effect is most pronounced at point a because it is located the farthest downstream of sites investigated and is affected by dams in the upstream area the highest peak discharge event in the observational data was associated with typhoon lionrock in 2016 nguyen le and yamada 2017 which was the first time in the history of observations that three typhoons had affected the area 2 weeks previously which led to heavy rainfall onto a highly saturated soil the data used in this study are taken from 5 days prior to heavy rainfall events and may not fully account for the effects of such prior rainfall conditions however as the simulation results generally represent the relationship between rainfall and peak discharge well at all target points the hydrological model and d4pdf 5 km used in this study can be considered to adequately represent the characteristics of rainfall runoff phenomena that actually occur in the target basin as shown in fig 7 the peak discharge differs even for a given amount of rainfall for example at point a which has the largest catchment area of all investigated sites the highest peak discharges are more than twice as large as the lowest ones for the same rainfall amounts this characteristic is particularly significant at points b e indicating that the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall strongly influences peak discharge at these points which have smaller catchment areas as our results show on the other hand in river planning the targeted level of rainfall is selected through hydrologic frequency analysis using extreme value distributions such as the gumbel distribution to obtain the annual maximum rainfall amount however as noted above rainfall amounts selected from a limited number of observation years cover a wide range for example the 95 confidence interval of the targeted rainfall level e g 1 150 at point a is 180 0 to 249 1 mm these data indicate that both the uncertainty of the targeted rainfall level and the relationships between the spatiotemporal distribution of the designed level rainfall and hydrograph features must be clarified for a flood risk assessment 4 results and discussions 4 1 impacts of the number of clusters a total of 571 rainfall events were classified using the proposed method dendrograms for temporal and spatial classification are shown in figure s2 the sum of squared error sse was calculated to examine the influence of the number of clusters in the temporal or spatial classification on peak discharge sse was calculated as follows 7 sse clus t 1 n t clus s 1 n s i 1 n event clus t clus s x i c clus t clus s 2 where n t and n s are the number of clusters used for temporal and spatial classification respectively clus t and clus s indicate a cluster in temporal and spatial classification respectively n event clus t clus s is the number of events belonging to the cluster clus t clus s x i is the peak discharge for event i and c clus t clus s is the centroid of peak discharges belonging to the cluster clus t clus s fig 8 shows the sses of peak discharge when the numbers of clusters for temporal and spatial classifications were set from 1 to 15 the sses for peak discharge are higher when the number of clusters used for temporal or spatial classification is 1 n t 1 o r n s 1 than under other conditions n t 1 a n d n s 1 this indicates that both the temporal and spatial rainfall patterns are required to identify the rainfall patterns representing flood characteristics fig 8a which shows the sum of sses for five locations indicates that the decrease in sse with increasing cluster number decreases when the number of temporal classification clusters is 5 or more this indicates that 4 is an appropriate number of clusters for temporal classification on the other hand the decrease in sses with increasing number of clusters for spatial classification is smooth the number of clusters should be determined according to the user s needs such as the risk level based on hydrographic factors such as peak discharge as the proposed method uses hierarchical clustering an arbitrary number of clusters can be set in the following section we show results based on the use of 4 and 10 clusters for temporal and spatial classification respectively 4 2 temporal rainfall patterns the results of temporal classification using 4 clusters clusters t1 t4 figure s2a are shown in fig 9 the numbers of rainfall events are 122 92 94 and 263 events in clusters t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively representative rainfall events r events red lines in fig 9 were defined as the rainfall event with the minimum distance from other rainfall events within the same cluster i e the r event is an i event that satisfies arg min 1 i n event clus t 1 j 1 n event clus t 1 t dist i i j the hyetographs of rainfall events in the same clusters gray lines in fig 9 are shifted to minimize the distance between the representative rainfall event r event and each rainfall event i event t dist r i r the cluster averaged hyetographs blue lines in fig 9 were calculated as the average of the shifted rainfall events and the representative rainfall event in the same cluster the shape of the cluster averaged hyetograph is in the order of cluster t1 t2 t3 and t4 from narrowest to widest the shape of the hyetograph of cluster t1 is a single narrow peak the maximum rainfall intensity of the cluster averaged hyetograph of cluster t1 is greater than 20 mm h representing stronger rainfall than in other clusters the hyetographs belonging to cluster t2 also tend to have a single peak however the maximum rainfall intensity is lower than in cluster t1 the shape of the cluster averaged hyetograph and the hyetograph of the representative rainfall event in cluster t3 each show peaks representing torrential rainfall the peak of which is approximately 13 mm h as well as prior rainfall i e approximately 10 h before the torrential rainfall numerous small rainfall events are contained within the 72 h period of cluster t4 which has the broadest hyetograph shape the proportion of 4 k exp is 95 91 82 and 78 for cluster t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively these results indicate that the frequency of intense rainfall with a 150 year return period represented by cluster t1 will increase significantly under future climate conditions the relative frequency histograms of peak discharge for each cluster based on the temporal classification are shown in fig 10 the majority of rainfall events with high peak discharges at any location belong to cluster t1 cluster t4 contains the largest number of rainfall events however most of these events have small peak discharges these results demonstrate that temporal classification can detect high risk rainfall patterns in terms of peak discharge 4 3 spatial rainfall patterns the cluster averaged rainfall distributions of 10 clusters clusters s1 s10 figure s2b obtained from spatial classification are shown in fig 11 in cluster s1 rainfall is concentrated in the western part of the basin the number of rainfall events belonging to cluster s1 is 15 which is the smallest number among the 10 clusters the rainfall distributions of clusters s2 s4 are concentrated in the hidaka mountains on the southwest side of the basin in particular cluster s3 shows the highest concentration of rainfall in the hidaka mountains in clusters s2 s4 the proportion of 4 k exp events is more than 90 which is higher than other clusters except for cluster s6 the rainfall distribution of cluster s5 is widely spread across the entire basin events in cluster s6 and s7 are distributed across a wide area on the east side of the basin with cluster s6 focused in the southeast portion of the basin and cluster s7 in the northeast portion of the basin the rainfall distributions of cluster s8 s10 are concentrated on the north side of the basin with cluster s8 showing a particularly significant concentration in this area the histograms of peak discharge for each cluster obtained from spatial classification are shown in fig 12 the cluster to which the rainfall event with the highest peak discharge belongs varies among target locations rainfall events belonging to cluster s1 and s2 clusters s1 s3 cluster s1 and s10 cluster s3 and cluster s7 produce large peak discharges at points a b c d and e respectively the results show that the areas of concentrated rainfall correspond to the catchment area where large peak discharges occur the number of events in cluster s5 is second greatest among the 10 clusters however the numbers of rainfall events with large peak discharge at all target points are small this result is expected because rainfall in cluster s5 is widely distributed across the whole basin 4 4 spatiotemporal rainfall patterns the spatiotemporal classification results 4 10 clusters 4 temporal patterns and 10 spatial patterns are shown in figs 13 and 14 the cluster names are obtained from row and column numbers e g cluster t1 s1 indicates the cluster corresponding to cluster t1 and cluster s1 in fig 13a b the number of events belonging to cluster t4 s5 and cluster t4 s10 which have wide hyetograph shapes and broad rainfall distribution patterns are the largest among all clusters in both past exp and 4 k exp the proportions of 4 k exp data in clusters representing intensive rainfall in both temporal and spatial terms such as cluster t1 s2 and cluster t1 s3 are high the probability of occurrence per year for each cluster in past exp 4 k exp and the difference between these probabilities are shown in fig 13c e respectively the probabilities for past exp and 4 k exp are the numbers of events in each cluster divided by the total analysis periods of 3000 years and 5400 years respectively the results indicate that probabilities are high for most clusters in the 4 k exp in particular cluster t1 s5 and cluster t4 s10 show increases exceeding 0 4 yr fig 14 shows the cluster averaged peak river discharge at each point peak discharge tends to fall in the order of cluster t1 t2 t3 and t4 from highest to lowest regardless of location and cluster of spatial rainfall pattern the duration of high discharge i e time above 1 2 of the average peak discharge for 571 targeted events at each point which is also important indicator of the characteristics of floods shows the opposite trend figure s3 these results indicate that temporal classification can explain the characteristics of hydrograph shape on the other hand the results of spatial classification are closely related to differences in peak discharge at each location the peak discharge of cluster t1 s1 is the largest among all clusters at points a and b at points c d and e cluster t1 s8 cluster t1 s3 and cluster t1 s8 produce the maximum peak discharges respectively the areas of concentrated rainfall for those clusters correspond to the upstream area of each basin where large peak discharge tends to occur the impact of the spatial rainfall pattern on peak discharge is smallest at point a as catchment a is larger than other catchment areas these results demonstrate that the characteristics of hydrographs for each point in the target basin can be determined from the combination of temporal and spatial rainfall characteristics 5 summary climate change is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of torrential rainfall and flood disasters in japan e g yamada 2019 mext and jma 2020 moe 2020 in recent years an ensemble climate dataset has been used for flood risk assessment and planning of flood control measures yamada 2019 the use of such data has led to improved risk assessments however in practice using data for thousands of years directly for investigation of flood damage and flood control planning is difficult this study proposes a spatiotemporal pattern classification method for heavy rainfall that can clarify rainfall patterns through characterization of the shape of hydrographs for rivers particularly peak discharge values using a large ensemble climate dataset the proposed classification method was applied to the hundreds of heavy rainfall events over a 10 000 km2 scale river basin consisting of thousands of km2 scale sub catchments first rainfall events corresponding to the 95 confidence interval of the 150 year return period rainfall estimated with the probability limit method test were extracted from the large ensemble climate dataset although a few observation records had sparse spatiotemporal resolution 571 rainfall events corresponding to the 150 year return period rainfall could be used from the ensemble climate dataset with hourly and 5 5 km resolution next the method for classifying rainfall events based on spatiotemporal rainfall patterns was applied to those 571 rainfall events we confirmed that the classification results obtained using 4 10 clusters 4 temporal and 10 spatial patterns have an appropriate spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall characteristics and represent the magnitude of peak discharge in the main river and tributaries these results show that accurate classification allowing for both temporal and spatial rainfall distributions is required to elucidate accurate and more realistic relationships between rainfall patterns and peak discharges the classification method proposed here must be useful for examining the impact of the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall on the flood hydrologic response and discussing the reduction of the risks associated with heavy rainfall in any catchment the proposed classification method can be applied to high resolution massive ensemble climate data to detect rainfall patterns that lead to high river discharge at various locations within the catchment the impact of the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall on flooding the nonlinear response of the rainfall runoff process has not been clear yet zhu et al 2018 the vague understanding which may be caused by the limited number of target catchments and rainfall patterns will be more apparent using the detected various rainfall patterns in a river catchment the spatiotemporal rainfall patterns of designated rainfall levels which strongly influence the scenario of heavy rainfall disaster i e the type of disaster location and magnitude of damage are also difficult to determine due to the limited number of rainfall observations and thus are worthy of further investigation by assuming damage scenarios caused by classified rainfall patterns effective flood control measures can be implemented the effect of flood control plans such as dams retarding basins etc varies with different flood patterns by considering rainfall patterns it is possible to examine the optimal arrangement and operation of flood control facilities in addition as this method simply combines temporal and spatial classification the characteristics of the classified rainfall patterns are visually apparent the method can also set the degree of subdivision used for classification these characteristics are expected to meet the needs of various sectors considering the implementation of flood control measures in conclusion the classification method developed in this study will be a key tool for effective use of expected climate data with high resolution and large ensemble sizes to support future flood control

2396,peak discharge in rivers mostly varies depending on spatiotemporal characteristics of the rainfall even with the same total rainfall amount however the spatiotemporal patterns of heavy rainfall such as rainfall levels used for river planning are difficult to determine due to the limited number of rainfall observations we propose a spatiotemporal classification method for massive ensemble rainfall datasets produced through dynamical downscaling with a regional climate model to clarify the possible rainfall patterns this classification method was applied to several hundred heavy rainfall events from the massive ensemble climate dataset corresponding to identical exceedance probabilities within a given statistical confidence interval i e 95 confidence interval of the 150 year return period in the probability limit test the new classification method detected spatiotemporal rainfall patterns affecting peak discharges in the main river and tributaries within the target basin these classified rainfall patterns can be used to investigate damage scenarios in the target basin which are difficult to determine from the observed rainfall patterns as a result the proposed method with the massive ensemble climate dataset will contribute to flood control planning keywords spatial temporal pattern heavy rainfall classification hierarchical cluster analysis d4pdf climate change 1 introduction to take countermeasures against disasters caused by heavy rainfall it is necessary to estimate possible damage patterns of a river basin characteristics of heavy rainfall disasters are strongly influenced by the spatiotemporal patterns as well as the amounts of rainfall for example the location and intensity of damage within a river basin and the pattern of damage flooding from rivers flooding from inland waters sediment related disasters etc vary depending on the spatiotemporal distribution of the rainfall therefore to realize effective flood control measures it is important to understand the various spatiotemporal patterns of rainfall that can occur in river basins and to develop countermeasures based on the characteristics of the hazards associated with each rainfall pattern climate change is projected to increase the unevenness in the distribution of rainfall amounts while increasing the frequency and amount of heavy rainfall in some areas ipcc 2021 disasters caused by heavy rainfall are expected to become increasingly severe and frequent in japan e g yamada 2019 mext and jma 2020 moe 2020 in hokkaido the northern island of japan heavy rainfall events due to a series of four typhoons over 2 weeks resulted in flooding and sediment related disasters in august 2016 in response the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit and hokkaido prefecture began to consider a flood control plan that accounts for the impact of climate change yamada 2019 with this new flood control plan the differences in flood risk due to the amounts and patterns of rainfall at the river basin scale were thoroughly discussed thus the spatiotemporal patterns of the rainfall as well as changes in the rainfall amount are considered when planning adaptation measures to climate change several previous studies have examined the impact of the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall on the flood hydrologic response e g krajewski et al 1991 nicotina et al 2008 viglione et al 2010 paschalis et al 2014 zhu et al 2018 most previous studies used hydrological models with observed rainfall data or spatiotemporal rainfall distributions generated by rainfall generators based on the monte carlo method the studies aimed to elucidate the influence of spatiotemporal variability of rainfall on flooding based on the effects of the topographic characteristics of the river basin such as the catchment size however the impact of the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall on flooding has not been clear yet some studies concluded conflicting findings regarding the relative importance of spatial and temporal rainfall resolution e g zhu et al 2018 most previous studies are based on the limited number of target catchments and rainfall patterns cristiano et al 2017 which may cause vague understanding in addition although both the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall and the topographic features of the river basin determine characteristics of flooding the typical rainfall patterns that can occur in a river basin have not been adequately investigated therefore patterns of damage caused by possible heavy rainfall cannot be sufficiently foreseen in recent years ensemble climate databases e g mizuta et al 2017 fujita et al 2019 have been used to assess the impact of climate change at the regional scale e g yamada 2019 ishii and mori 2020 the probability of the occurrence of extremely heavy rainfall possible flood disasters and of future change can be estimated based on thousands of heavy rainfall events in a large climate database yamada 2019 numerous rainfall events in large climate databases can be used to detect possible spatiotemporal rainfall patterns over river basins under past and future climates the influence of such rainfall patterns on the type and magnitude of flood damage can also be estimated comprehensively however due to the large number of rainfall events included in the climate databases classification of rainfall patterns using appropriate clustering methods is important to estimate damage scenarios and plan flood control in a basin this need has recently emerged based on the availability of ensemble climate data containing thousands of years of heavy rainfall events the development of a spatiotemporal pattern classification method for heavy rainfall and its application to ensemble climate data will significantly contribute to the detection of possible disaster scenarios and the development of new flood control measures in this study we propose a method of classifying rainfall events based on spatiotemporal rainfall patterns to enable the identification of representative heavy rainfall patterns with characteristic hydrograph features such as peak discharge the newly developed classification method was applied to hundreds of heavy rainfall events over the tokachi river basin in the ensemble climate dataset the remainder of this paper proceeds as follows the methodology of rainfall pattern classification is introduced in section 2 the target basin and rainfall data for classification are described in section 3 the clustering results are presented in section 4 and the study is summarized in section 5 2 methodology the framework of the rainfall pattern classification method proposed in this study is shown in fig 1 the input data for classification comprise time series of gridded rainfall data covering a target catchment area all target rainfall events must have the same time and space resolution the method classifies rainfall events separately in terms of temporal and spatial aspects hereinafter temporal classification and spatial classification respectively for both temporal and spatial classification rainfall events are classified by hierarchical cluster analysis kaufman et al 1990 based on similarities between all pairs of rainfall events in terms of their temporal and spatial patterns respectively calculated using the definitions below for spatiotemporal classification rainfall events are classified based on the results of both temporal and spatial rainfall classifications the details of each process are described below the source code of the classification is provided in appendix a 2 1 temporal classification for temporal classification rainfall data is at first converted into area averaged time series rainfall hyetograph over the entire target basin using the following equation 1 r t t p 1 p num r t p p num where t is time p is a spatial point in the target basin p num is the number of p r is rainfall intensity as a function of t and p and r t is a time series of area averaged rainfall intensity hyetograph in the target basin next the starting and ending times of the target rainfall events t sta and t end respectively are determined as the timing of the rainfall amount during the target rainfall duration t p becomes maximum t p is a given value e g 72 h t sta and t end must follow t end t sta t p this preparation is done for all target rainfall events the similarities of all pairs of rainfall events are then quantified from the hyetographs as distances here we show the methodology for calculation of the distance between two rainfall events i and j event as an example the distance calculation consists of 4 steps fig 2 in the first step the differences δ r for each time step between the two hyetographs are calculated using eqs 2 and 3 2 δ r i j t t r t i t sta i t r t j t sta j t t 3 δ r j i t t r t j t sta j t r t i t sta i t t where t is the variable for iterative calculation t t d t d 1 t d 1 t d t d is the permissible time difference described below subscripts i and j indicate rainfall events e g t sta i and t sta j indicate area averaged hourly rainfall intensity of the i and the j event respectively the permissible time difference t d which is a given value e g 24 h is used in eqs 2 and 3 to reduce the excessive influence of small rainfall events occurring before and after periods of intense rainfall events a schematic diagram of the calculation of δ r i j is shown in fig 3 the example of calculation δ r i j under the condition of t d 0 equivalent to not considering the permissible time difference is shown in fig 3a in this case the distance appears significant although the shapes of the hydrographs during the intense rainfall periods are similar such apparently significant differences arise due to the selected target period which frequently includes light rainfall before and after the intense rainfall period therefore in this study the permissible time difference t d is used to calculate the distance emphasizing the similarity of shapes of intense rainfall the example of calculation δ r i j under the condition of t 2 is shown in fig 3b in this case the distance for temporal classification between the two rainfall events defined later is determined under this condition t 2 because the difference is smallest when t 2 due to introduction of the permissible time difference the two differences δ r i j t t and δ r j i t t are not equal if t d 0 δ r i j t t and δ r j i t t are completely same in the second step root mean square errors rmses of r t i and r t j for each t are calculated using eqs 4 and 5 4 δ r i j t 1 t p t 0 t p 1 δ r i j t t 2 5 δ r j i t 1 t p t 0 t p 1 δ r j i t t 2 where δ r i j t and δ r j i t are rmses based on eqs 2 and 3 respectively δ r i j t and δ r j i t are calculated for each t between t d and t d in the third step the total distances t dist i and t dist j are obtained from δ r i j and δ r j i respectively t dist i and t dist j are defined as the smallest of δ r i j and δ r j i as described in eqs 6 and 7 6 t dist i i j min t d t t d δ r i j t 7 t dist j i j min t d t t d δ r j i t in the last step the distances between two rainfall events used in temporal classification t dist is defined as the smaller of t dist i and t dist j 8 t dist i j m i n t dist i i j t dist j i j the distance in terms of temporal rainfall pattern between i and j event t dist i j is defined as the minimum value of t dist i i j and t dist j i j the distances for all pairs of rainfall events are calculated using eqs 1 8 and converted into a distance matrix finally hierarchical cluster analysis is used to classify rainfall events based on temporal rainfall patterns from the distance matrix we selected hierarchical cluster analysis from several available classification methods because the number of clusters can be changed freely the number of clusters should be determined based on the scale of the target river or the target disaster type e g dyke breach inland flood or sediment disaster or the level of detail required by the decision makers in this study the ward method ward 1963 is used to calculate the distance between clusters in hierarchical cluster analysis 2 2 spatial classification the procedure of spatial classification is similar to that of temporal classification the only difference between the two classification methods is the definition of similarity between two rainfall events the input data for spatial classification is the spatial distribution of time integrated rainfall from t sta to t end firstly the time series of gridded rainfall data is converted into time integrated rainfall intensity for each grid point using the following equation 9 r s p t t sta t end r t p where r s is time integrated rainfall intensity as a function of the grid point the r s is calculated for all target rainfall events next the distance of the spatial rainfall pattern between two rainfall events i and j event is calculated the δ r s i j i e the differences between r s i and r s j for each grid point is calculated at all grid points using eq 10 10 δ r s i j p r s i p r s j p a schematic diagram of the calculation for δ r s i j is shown in fig 4 the total spatial difference between two events is then calculated as rmse using eq 11 11 s dist i j 1 p num p 1 p num δ r s i j p 2 where s dist i j is the distance in terms of the spatial rainfall pattern between the i and j events the s dist is calculated for all pairs of rainfall events using eqs 9 11 and is converted into a distance matrix finally the rainfall events are classified into clusters through hierarchical cluster analysis based on the distance matrix similar to the process used for temporal classification the ward method used in the temporal classification is also used for calculating the distance between clusters in hierarchical cluster analysis 2 3 spatiotemporal classification for the spatiotemporal classification as shown in fig 1 rainfall events are classified using a matrix with rows and columns corresponding to the clusters obtained from temporal and spatial classifications respectively 3 target area and dataset 3 1 tokachi river basin the developed classification method was applied to heavy rainfall events in the tokachi river basin in central hokkaido the northern island of japan fig 5 the tokachi river basin consists of the main river and three large tributaries the otofuke satsunai and toshibetsu rivers we targeted five discharge observation points designated moiwa point a located in the tokachi river 21 0 km from the outlet obihiro point b located in the tokachi river 56 7 km from the outlet otofuke point c located in the otofuke river satsunai point d located in the satsunai river and toshibetsu point e located in the toshibetsu river to clarify the relationship between classified rainfall patterns and river discharge at those five points in practice the river discharges at those points were calculated from the rating curves relation between discharge and water level which are estimated from the river channels cross sectional profiles and observed water levels and surface velocities the catchment areas of those five points hereinafter catchment a e are 8208 0 km2 2677 8 km2 707 9 km2 743 9 km2 and 2715 2 km2 respectively the observed annual maximum 72 h rainfall levels over the moiwa catchment catchment a from 1919 to 2018 were obtained from the mlit fig 6 the time scale used for river planning in this basin is 72 h based on the duration of major rainfall events in the past as peak discharge generally occurs within 72 h after the onset of rainfall therefore the target rainfall duration t p is set 72 h the permissible time difference t d is also set 72 h river discharge data from 1998 to 2018 were obtained from the mlit 3 2 d4pdf 5 5 km climate data the rainfall data were obtained from the database for policy decision making for future climate change d4pdf mizuta et al 2017 d4pdf is a massive ensemble climate experiment with spatial resolution of 20 20 km in east asia d4pdf 20 km it consists of the past experiment past exp which examined 3000 years of data i e 60 years 1951 2010 50 members using observed sea surface temperature sst data hirahara et al 2014 as the lower boundary condition and a future experiment 4 k exp assuming a 4 k increase in temperature from before the industrial revolution containing 5400 years of data i e 60 years 15 members 6 ssts in the 4 k exp six different ssts were selected from the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 in both past exp and 4 k exp the non hydrostatic regional climate model nhrcm sasaki et al 2008 was used for dynamical downscaling the total dataset representing 8400 years can be used to discuss extreme rainfall events that could occur under both past and future climate conditions with a physical basis d4pdf 20 km was dynamically downscaled to a spatial resolution of 5 5 km using the nhrcm d4pdf 5 km hoshino et al 2020 to more accurately represent intense hourly rainfall sasaki et al 2011 yamada et al 2021 here we used 8400 hourly rainfall events which are the annual maximum 72 h rainfall events over the moiwa catchment catchment a in the tokachi river basin extracted from d4pdf 5 km covering 3000 years for past exp and 5400 years for 4 k exp the frequencies of the annual maximum 72 h rainfall for the past exp and 4 k exp are shown in fig 6a the rainfall amount of the past exp shows a similar frequency distribution to the observed data in contrast rainfall in 4 k exp is much larger with 99th percentile values of the annual maximum 72 h rainfall of 227 0 mm and 299 9 mm for past exp and 4 k exp respectively 3 3 target rainfall events rainfall events at the scale of the 150 year return period which is equivalent to the target rainfall used for river planning in the tokachi river basin were subjected to classification the confidence interval of rainfall amount for each return period can be evaluated using the method based on extreme value statistical theory shimizu et al 2020a b which enabled the probability limit method test moriguti 1995 to apply hydrological frequency analysis the width of this confidence interval is completely independent of the ensemble approach fig 6b shows the amount of rainfall for each return period with confidence intervals obtained from observed annual maximum 72 h rainfall over the moiwa catchment catchment a based on 100 year observation using the statistical theory and assuming the gumbel distribution the expected value for a 150 year return period is 204 4 mm 72 h and the 95 confidence interval range is 180 0 249 1 mm 72 h we extracted rainfall events falling within the 95 confidence interval from past exp and 4 k exp as target rainfall events for pattern classification in total 571 rainfall events past exp 88 of 3000 total events 4 k exp 483 of 5400 total events satisfied this criterion fig 6a the selected rainfall events can be considered rainfall events with a 150 year return probability the proportion of events selected in the 4 k exp 483 5400 was approximately three times greater than in past exp 88 3000 this indicates that heavy rainfall at the scale of the 150 year return period under the past climate condition will become more frequent under a warmer climate 3 4 river discharges the hydrographs of the rainfall data of past exp and 4 k exp were estimated by the distributed two stage tank model and river flow simulation details are provided in text s1 to compare clustering results and characteristics of discharge at each discharge observation point in the target basin although several dams are present in the target basin we did not consider the influence of water management using dams located within the target river basin as the aim was to clarify the impact of spatiotemporal rainfall patterns on river discharge the relationship between the amount of rainfall in catchment a and peak discharge at point a e obtained from the hydrological model using all 8400 rainfall events in both the past exp and 4 k exp experiments along with observations collected between 1998 and 2018 is shown in fig 7 note that the peak discharges obtained from the hydrological model that was forced by d4pdf 5 km data are larger than the observed peaks because the model does not consider the influence of dam operations including water release and storage with the exception of point a the peak observed discharges fall within the range obtained from the hydrological model the modeled peak discharge was higher than the observed value with 140 mm or less rainfall at point a due to the effect of the dam which reduces peak discharge the effect is most pronounced at point a because it is located the farthest downstream of sites investigated and is affected by dams in the upstream area the highest peak discharge event in the observational data was associated with typhoon lionrock in 2016 nguyen le and yamada 2017 which was the first time in the history of observations that three typhoons had affected the area 2 weeks previously which led to heavy rainfall onto a highly saturated soil the data used in this study are taken from 5 days prior to heavy rainfall events and may not fully account for the effects of such prior rainfall conditions however as the simulation results generally represent the relationship between rainfall and peak discharge well at all target points the hydrological model and d4pdf 5 km used in this study can be considered to adequately represent the characteristics of rainfall runoff phenomena that actually occur in the target basin as shown in fig 7 the peak discharge differs even for a given amount of rainfall for example at point a which has the largest catchment area of all investigated sites the highest peak discharges are more than twice as large as the lowest ones for the same rainfall amounts this characteristic is particularly significant at points b e indicating that the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall strongly influences peak discharge at these points which have smaller catchment areas as our results show on the other hand in river planning the targeted level of rainfall is selected through hydrologic frequency analysis using extreme value distributions such as the gumbel distribution to obtain the annual maximum rainfall amount however as noted above rainfall amounts selected from a limited number of observation years cover a wide range for example the 95 confidence interval of the targeted rainfall level e g 1 150 at point a is 180 0 to 249 1 mm these data indicate that both the uncertainty of the targeted rainfall level and the relationships between the spatiotemporal distribution of the designed level rainfall and hydrograph features must be clarified for a flood risk assessment 4 results and discussions 4 1 impacts of the number of clusters a total of 571 rainfall events were classified using the proposed method dendrograms for temporal and spatial classification are shown in figure s2 the sum of squared error sse was calculated to examine the influence of the number of clusters in the temporal or spatial classification on peak discharge sse was calculated as follows 7 sse clus t 1 n t clus s 1 n s i 1 n event clus t clus s x i c clus t clus s 2 where n t and n s are the number of clusters used for temporal and spatial classification respectively clus t and clus s indicate a cluster in temporal and spatial classification respectively n event clus t clus s is the number of events belonging to the cluster clus t clus s x i is the peak discharge for event i and c clus t clus s is the centroid of peak discharges belonging to the cluster clus t clus s fig 8 shows the sses of peak discharge when the numbers of clusters for temporal and spatial classifications were set from 1 to 15 the sses for peak discharge are higher when the number of clusters used for temporal or spatial classification is 1 n t 1 o r n s 1 than under other conditions n t 1 a n d n s 1 this indicates that both the temporal and spatial rainfall patterns are required to identify the rainfall patterns representing flood characteristics fig 8a which shows the sum of sses for five locations indicates that the decrease in sse with increasing cluster number decreases when the number of temporal classification clusters is 5 or more this indicates that 4 is an appropriate number of clusters for temporal classification on the other hand the decrease in sses with increasing number of clusters for spatial classification is smooth the number of clusters should be determined according to the user s needs such as the risk level based on hydrographic factors such as peak discharge as the proposed method uses hierarchical clustering an arbitrary number of clusters can be set in the following section we show results based on the use of 4 and 10 clusters for temporal and spatial classification respectively 4 2 temporal rainfall patterns the results of temporal classification using 4 clusters clusters t1 t4 figure s2a are shown in fig 9 the numbers of rainfall events are 122 92 94 and 263 events in clusters t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively representative rainfall events r events red lines in fig 9 were defined as the rainfall event with the minimum distance from other rainfall events within the same cluster i e the r event is an i event that satisfies arg min 1 i n event clus t 1 j 1 n event clus t 1 t dist i i j the hyetographs of rainfall events in the same clusters gray lines in fig 9 are shifted to minimize the distance between the representative rainfall event r event and each rainfall event i event t dist r i r the cluster averaged hyetographs blue lines in fig 9 were calculated as the average of the shifted rainfall events and the representative rainfall event in the same cluster the shape of the cluster averaged hyetograph is in the order of cluster t1 t2 t3 and t4 from narrowest to widest the shape of the hyetograph of cluster t1 is a single narrow peak the maximum rainfall intensity of the cluster averaged hyetograph of cluster t1 is greater than 20 mm h representing stronger rainfall than in other clusters the hyetographs belonging to cluster t2 also tend to have a single peak however the maximum rainfall intensity is lower than in cluster t1 the shape of the cluster averaged hyetograph and the hyetograph of the representative rainfall event in cluster t3 each show peaks representing torrential rainfall the peak of which is approximately 13 mm h as well as prior rainfall i e approximately 10 h before the torrential rainfall numerous small rainfall events are contained within the 72 h period of cluster t4 which has the broadest hyetograph shape the proportion of 4 k exp is 95 91 82 and 78 for cluster t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively these results indicate that the frequency of intense rainfall with a 150 year return period represented by cluster t1 will increase significantly under future climate conditions the relative frequency histograms of peak discharge for each cluster based on the temporal classification are shown in fig 10 the majority of rainfall events with high peak discharges at any location belong to cluster t1 cluster t4 contains the largest number of rainfall events however most of these events have small peak discharges these results demonstrate that temporal classification can detect high risk rainfall patterns in terms of peak discharge 4 3 spatial rainfall patterns the cluster averaged rainfall distributions of 10 clusters clusters s1 s10 figure s2b obtained from spatial classification are shown in fig 11 in cluster s1 rainfall is concentrated in the western part of the basin the number of rainfall events belonging to cluster s1 is 15 which is the smallest number among the 10 clusters the rainfall distributions of clusters s2 s4 are concentrated in the hidaka mountains on the southwest side of the basin in particular cluster s3 shows the highest concentration of rainfall in the hidaka mountains in clusters s2 s4 the proportion of 4 k exp events is more than 90 which is higher than other clusters except for cluster s6 the rainfall distribution of cluster s5 is widely spread across the entire basin events in cluster s6 and s7 are distributed across a wide area on the east side of the basin with cluster s6 focused in the southeast portion of the basin and cluster s7 in the northeast portion of the basin the rainfall distributions of cluster s8 s10 are concentrated on the north side of the basin with cluster s8 showing a particularly significant concentration in this area the histograms of peak discharge for each cluster obtained from spatial classification are shown in fig 12 the cluster to which the rainfall event with the highest peak discharge belongs varies among target locations rainfall events belonging to cluster s1 and s2 clusters s1 s3 cluster s1 and s10 cluster s3 and cluster s7 produce large peak discharges at points a b c d and e respectively the results show that the areas of concentrated rainfall correspond to the catchment area where large peak discharges occur the number of events in cluster s5 is second greatest among the 10 clusters however the numbers of rainfall events with large peak discharge at all target points are small this result is expected because rainfall in cluster s5 is widely distributed across the whole basin 4 4 spatiotemporal rainfall patterns the spatiotemporal classification results 4 10 clusters 4 temporal patterns and 10 spatial patterns are shown in figs 13 and 14 the cluster names are obtained from row and column numbers e g cluster t1 s1 indicates the cluster corresponding to cluster t1 and cluster s1 in fig 13a b the number of events belonging to cluster t4 s5 and cluster t4 s10 which have wide hyetograph shapes and broad rainfall distribution patterns are the largest among all clusters in both past exp and 4 k exp the proportions of 4 k exp data in clusters representing intensive rainfall in both temporal and spatial terms such as cluster t1 s2 and cluster t1 s3 are high the probability of occurrence per year for each cluster in past exp 4 k exp and the difference between these probabilities are shown in fig 13c e respectively the probabilities for past exp and 4 k exp are the numbers of events in each cluster divided by the total analysis periods of 3000 years and 5400 years respectively the results indicate that probabilities are high for most clusters in the 4 k exp in particular cluster t1 s5 and cluster t4 s10 show increases exceeding 0 4 yr fig 14 shows the cluster averaged peak river discharge at each point peak discharge tends to fall in the order of cluster t1 t2 t3 and t4 from highest to lowest regardless of location and cluster of spatial rainfall pattern the duration of high discharge i e time above 1 2 of the average peak discharge for 571 targeted events at each point which is also important indicator of the characteristics of floods shows the opposite trend figure s3 these results indicate that temporal classification can explain the characteristics of hydrograph shape on the other hand the results of spatial classification are closely related to differences in peak discharge at each location the peak discharge of cluster t1 s1 is the largest among all clusters at points a and b at points c d and e cluster t1 s8 cluster t1 s3 and cluster t1 s8 produce the maximum peak discharges respectively the areas of concentrated rainfall for those clusters correspond to the upstream area of each basin where large peak discharge tends to occur the impact of the spatial rainfall pattern on peak discharge is smallest at point a as catchment a is larger than other catchment areas these results demonstrate that the characteristics of hydrographs for each point in the target basin can be determined from the combination of temporal and spatial rainfall characteristics 5 summary climate change is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of torrential rainfall and flood disasters in japan e g yamada 2019 mext and jma 2020 moe 2020 in recent years an ensemble climate dataset has been used for flood risk assessment and planning of flood control measures yamada 2019 the use of such data has led to improved risk assessments however in practice using data for thousands of years directly for investigation of flood damage and flood control planning is difficult this study proposes a spatiotemporal pattern classification method for heavy rainfall that can clarify rainfall patterns through characterization of the shape of hydrographs for rivers particularly peak discharge values using a large ensemble climate dataset the proposed classification method was applied to the hundreds of heavy rainfall events over a 10 000 km2 scale river basin consisting of thousands of km2 scale sub catchments first rainfall events corresponding to the 95 confidence interval of the 150 year return period rainfall estimated with the probability limit method test were extracted from the large ensemble climate dataset although a few observation records had sparse spatiotemporal resolution 571 rainfall events corresponding to the 150 year return period rainfall could be used from the ensemble climate dataset with hourly and 5 5 km resolution next the method for classifying rainfall events based on spatiotemporal rainfall patterns was applied to those 571 rainfall events we confirmed that the classification results obtained using 4 10 clusters 4 temporal and 10 spatial patterns have an appropriate spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall characteristics and represent the magnitude of peak discharge in the main river and tributaries these results show that accurate classification allowing for both temporal and spatial rainfall distributions is required to elucidate accurate and more realistic relationships between rainfall patterns and peak discharges the classification method proposed here must be useful for examining the impact of the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall on the flood hydrologic response and discussing the reduction of the risks associated with heavy rainfall in any catchment the proposed classification method can be applied to high resolution massive ensemble climate data to detect rainfall patterns that lead to high river discharge at various locations within the catchment the impact of the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall on flooding the nonlinear response of the rainfall runoff process has not been clear yet zhu et al 2018 the vague understanding which may be caused by the limited number of target catchments and rainfall patterns will be more apparent using the detected various rainfall patterns in a river catchment the spatiotemporal rainfall patterns of designated rainfall levels which strongly influence the scenario of heavy rainfall disaster i e the type of disaster location and magnitude of damage are also difficult to determine due to the limited number of rainfall observations and thus are worthy of further investigation by assuming damage scenarios caused by classified rainfall patterns effective flood control measures can be implemented the effect of flood control plans such as dams retarding basins etc varies with different flood patterns by considering rainfall patterns it is possible to examine the optimal arrangement and operation of flood control facilities in addition as this method simply combines temporal and spatial classification the characteristics of the classified rainfall patterns are visually apparent the method can also set the degree of subdivision used for classification these characteristics are expected to meet the needs of various sectors considering the implementation of flood control measures in conclusion the classification method developed in this study will be a key tool for effective use of expected climate data with high resolution and large ensemble sizes to support future flood control

2397,reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxides triggered by biodegradation of organic matter om are considered to be key processes controlling iodine i release in groundwater systems however the precise mechanisms involved in release from organic matter degradation and from fe oxyhydr oxides are unclear in this study dual stable isotope analysis δ 13c and δ 56fe was combined with ultraviolet visible spectral characterization of dissolved organic matter to elucidate the mechanisms of iodine enrichment in groundwater of the central yangtze river basin china which represents quaternary alluvial lacustrine floodplains high iodine groundwater mainly occurs along the yangtze river yr and han river hr with a maximum concentration of 1220 μg l the results suggest that methanogenesis driven by the biodegradation of high molecular weight organic compounds can promote the reductive dissolution of amorphous fe oxyhydr oxides which is the predominant process controlling iodine enrichment in the yr groundwater system in addition fermentation accompanied by sulfate reduction can also trigger the release of iodine into groundwater the reductive dissolution of crystallized fe oxyhydr oxides driven by the fermentation of small molecule organic compounds is the dominant process responsible for iodine enrichment in the hr groundwater system this study provides novel insight into the mechanisms of iodine enrichment in quaternary alluvial lacustrine aquifers keywords iodine iron oxides organic matter carbon and iron isotopes alluvial lacustrine aquifer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction iodine i is an essential micronutrient for human beings ensuring normal thyroid functions at moderate amounts however both insufficient and excessive iodine intake can cause severe metabolic disturbances and lead to diseases with potential health consequences such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism taylor et al 2018 high iodine groundwater has been reported in many areas around the world posing a high potential risk to human thyroid function especially for the residents using groundwater as the main source of drinking water supply li et al 2013 pichel and vivar 2017 teng et al 2006 voutchkova et al 2017 voutchkova et al 2014 zhang et al 2021b in china excessive iodine intake from iodine rich groundwater affects a population of nearly 40 million in 11 provinces which has been shown to be associated with an increased prevalence of endemic goiter and hypothyroidism andersen et al 2009 shen et al 2011 thus understanding the mechanisms of iodine enrichment in groundwater is critical to eliminating the risk of exposure to high iodine contents and providing safe drinking water geogenic high iodine groundwater occurs mostly in arid semi arid inland basins and coastal areas wang et al 2021b recently our research group has first reported the occurrence of high iodine groundwater in the alluvial lacustrine plains along the middle reaches of the yangtze river luo et al 2022 xue et al 2022a 2021 however the potential mechanism of iodine enrichment in floodplain groundwater is poorly understood under reductive conditions the biodegradation of organic matter om and reductive dissolution of iron fe oxyhydr oxides are considered to be the key processes controlling iodine release in groundwater systems li et al 2014 li et al 2013 wang et al 2021b both om and fe oxyhydr oxides are considered to serve as significant hosts of iodine in sediments dai et al 2004 li et al 2013 nagata and fukushi 2010 nagata et al 2009 wang et al 2021b xu et al 2011 which may affect the spatial distribution of iodine in aquifer systems recently sequential extraction experiments of chemically active iodine in sediments increasingly showed that abundant iodine is bound to fe oxides in sediments xue et al 2022a b including exchangeable iodine adhered to the surface of metal hydr oxides and fe oxides associated iodine fractions laboratory incubation experiments have also revealed that reduction of fe oxyhydr oxides in natural sediments to fe ii can promote the transformation of fe minerals and lead to the release of iodine into groundwater li et al 2020 therefore fe and natural organic matter nom can jointly control the behavior of iodine in aquifer systems to some extent however the effects of the degradation pathway of nom and the crystallization degree of fe oxyhydr oxides on geogenic iodine enrichment in groundwater is still largely unknown better knowledge the precise mechanisms would improve our understanding of its role in iodine mobilization carbon isotopes δ13c can reveal the sources of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and the extent of om degradation in groundwater nowak et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 and they have been applied in the study of the formation mechanism of geogenic contaminated groundwater such as arsenic guo et al 2014 stopelli et al 2021 wang et al 2014 xie et al 2013a yang et al 2020b zhou et al 2018 ammonium du et al 2020 and phosphorus tao et al 2022 inorganic carbon isotopes have been applied for iodine rich groundwater in the north china plain ncp and the biodegradation process of om has been identified to have potential effects on iodine rich groundwater xue et al 2019b positive δ13c was detected in high ammonium groundwater of the central yangtze river basin indicating that the intensive degradation of om associated with methanogenesis led to the ammonium enrichment du et al 2020 stopelli et al 2021 comprehensively analyzed δ13c dic δ13c doc and δ13c ch4 and suggested that methane cycling could play an overlooked role in many arsenic rich aquifers around the world stopelli et al 2021 our research group recently used δ13c dic and found that the degradation of om with different molecular compositions through fermentation and methanogenesis could both promote iodine release into groundwater in the central yangtze river basin deng et al unpublished data but the effect of fe oxyhydr oxides was not considered fe isotopes can be used as a good indicator of the pathways and mechanisms of fe oxidation reduction precipitation dissolution and adsorption desorption in environments dauphas et al 2017 wu et al 2019 previous studies identified three pathways of coupled arsenic and iron cycling in high arsenic groundwater using fe isotopes including microbial fe iii reduction fe ii re adsorption and pyrite and siderite precipitation which can affect the migration and transformation of arsenic in aquifer systems guo et al 2013 wang et al 2014 xie et al 2013b xie et al 2014 yang et al 2020a c fe isotopes can be used in combination to reveal the effects of biogeochemical cycle of fe om on iodine in aquifer systems unfortunately thus far they have not been jointly used in studies on iodine enrichment in groundwater the jianghan plain jhp is a typical alluvial lacustrine plain with abundant om buried in aquifers hosting groundwater with high geogenic arsenic and ammonium deng et al 2018 du et al 2020 gan et al 2014 we firstly reported groundwater with high iodine concentrations reaching up to 1590 μg l in the central yangtze river basin luo et al 2022 in addition we hypothesized through extraction experiments that the interaction between fe oxides and om controlled iodine mobilization xue et al 2022a however there has been no sufficient field evidence to support this hypothesis the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the spatial distribution of iodine in groundwater of jhp china 2 provide c fe isotope evidence for identifying the key biogeochemical cycling processes related to fe om transformation that control iodine release to groundwater and 3 provide novel insight into the mechanism of geogenic high iodine groundwater in quaternary alluvial lacustrine aquifer systems 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the jianghan plain is formed by the alluviation of the yangtze river yr and han river hr located in the central yangtze river basin downstream it has a subtropical monsoonal climate with an average annual temperature ranging from 15 to 17 the annual average evaporation and precipitation are 1200 mm and 1269 mm respectively according to our hydrogeological investigation the quaternary aquifer systems in jhp may comprise two units

shimadzu japan in the 200 700 nm wavelength range with an interval of 1 nm and ultrapure water as the blank the specific uv absorbance suva254 which is routinely used as an indicator of aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 was obtained by dividing the uv absorbance at 254 nm α254 m 1 by the doc concentration cdoc mg l of the corresponding water sample the e2 e3 ratio was calculated as the ratio of absorbance at 250 nm to 365 nm α254 α365 to track changes in the relative size of dom molecules the e2 e3 ratio decreased with increasing molecular size because of stronger light absorption by high molecular weight hmw om at longer wavelengths de haan and de boer 1987 helms et al 2008 timko et al 2015 the ratio of absorption spectral slopes sr can reflect the apparent molecular weights of dom helms et al 2008 timko et al 2015 spectral slopes for the intervals of 275 295 nm s275 295 and 350 400 nm s350 400 were calculated using the linear regression of the log transformed spectra and the slope ratio or sr was then calculated as the ratio of s275 295 to s350 400 which can be used to represent the ratio of lmw to hmw components in dom twardowski et al 2004 3 results 3 1 groundwater chemistry iodine concentration in the groundwater of jhp ranged from 0 001 to 1220 μg l with an average of 168 μg l the iodine concentration was higher than 100 μg l in 1 3 of the samples iodine rich groundwater 100 μg l is mainly distributed in the meandering banks of the yr and along hr in contrast the iodine concentration is relatively low in the straight river banks of yr and the center of jhp fig 1 focusing on the enrichment mechanism of high iodine groundwater along yr and hr in jhp the low iodine groundwater in the hinterland of the plain was excluded from the discussion in this study the major groundwater hydrochemical types in jhp were ca hco3 and ca mg hco3 the ph and eh values corrected to she of groundwater samples ranged from 6 50 to 7 86 average 7 27 median 7 37 and from 22 0 to 338 mv average 95 mv median 80 mv respectively the eh values of all iodine rich groundwater samples was 150 mv indicating that the reducing environment is conducive to iodine enrichment in groundwater the range of dissolved organic carbon doc in groundwater was 0 06 21 4 mg l with an average of 7 72 mg l and a median of 5 90 mg l the cl br mass ratio in groundwater samples ranged from 0 19 to 1700 with an average of 90 1 and a median of 8 36 as shown in fig 2 iodine concentration in groundwater along yr and hr both increased with doc concentration and the cl br mass ratio was mostly 50 which differ from the results of previous studies on high iodine groundwater in typical arid semi arid inland basins and coastal areas for instance the cl br molar ratios of the datong basin were 171 2656 with conversion mass ratios of 76 1180 li et al 2016 the cl br mass ratios of most areas in the cangzhou region of the north china plain were above 971 1 zhang et al 2021a the cl br molar ratios of the piedmont and central areas in the north china plain were 786 1120 conversion mass ratios of 349 498 with a relative standard deviation of 119 conversion mass ratio of 53 xue et al 2019a and the cl br molar ratios of the coastal plain of the north china plain were 147 2547 relative standard deviation of 535 with conversion mass ratios of 65 1132 relative standard deviation of 233 xue et al 2019a the cl br mass ratios of groundwater in jhp are lower than those in other areas which could be related to the degradation of om du et al 2018 mcarthur et al 2012 yang et al 2020b in addition according to fig 2a the doc concentration in the yr iodine rich groundwater was higher than hr the nh4 and fe2 concentrations of groundwater samples ranged from 0 01 to 40 0 mg l average 4 79 mg l median 2 70 mg l and from 0 02 to 22 3 mg l average 6 26 mg l median 6 00 mg l respectively there were no significant correlation between iodine concentration and nh4 and fe2 fig 2c 2d combined with the results of ph and eh in the yr and hr groundwater fig s1 it can be speculated that there may be complex biogeochemical processes affecting iodine enrichment in the yr and hr groundwater systems 3 2 isotope geochemistry stable inorganic carbon and iron isotope the inorganic carbon isotopic compositions δ13c dic of groundwater in jhp ranged from 24 3 to 3 78 specifically groundwater δ13c dic ranged from 24 3 to 3 78 along yr and from 17 5 to 0 39 in hr fig 3 a the δ13c dic value of the iodine rich groundwater i 100 μg l with an average of 10 9 in yr was higher than those of the iodine depleted groundwater average 13 0 on the contrary the δ13c dic value of the iodine rich groundwater with an average of 10 5 in hr was slightly lower than those of iodine depleted groundwater average 10 3 groundwater δ56fe in jhp varied from 3 89 to 0 43 ranging from 2 58 to 0 43 in yr and from 3 89 to 0 07 in hr fig 3b the δ56fe value of the iodine rich groundwater i 100 μg l with an average of 1 46 in yr was lower than that of iodine depleted groundwater average 0 47 on the contrary the δ56fe value of the iodine rich groundwater i 100 μg l with an average of 0 99 in hr was higher than that of iodine depleted groundwater average 1 37 the characteristics of both δ13c dic and δ56fe in the yr hr groundwater were different between iodine rich and iodine depleted groundwater and an inverse trend was observed between isotope and iodine concentration fig 3 this further indicates the possibility of different biogeochemical cycles affecting the behavior of iodine in the yr and hr groundwater 3 3 spectral indices of dom the suva254 e2 e3 and sr values of groundwater samples from yr ranged from 1 46 to 25 1 from 8 00 to 125 and from 0 07 to 1 43 respectively the suva254 e2 e3 and sr values of groundwater samples from hr varied from 5 19 to 55 3 from 19 7 to 410 and from 0 10 to 0 53 respectively the suva254 and e2 e3 values of groundwater in yr are lower than those in hr whereas the sr values are higher than those in hr this indicates that compared with hr groundwater the degree of aromaticity and relative mw of dom in the groundwater of yr are lower but the proportion of lmw organic compounds is higher further analysis of the relationship between the spectral indices of dom in groundwater and iodine concentration showed that with the increase of iodine concentration the e2 e3 values of groundwater in yr decreased and sr increased whereas suva254 showed no distinct variation pattern regarding the groundwater of hr suva254 e2 e3 and sr all decreased with iodine concentration fig 4 the degree of aromaticity of dom decreased and the relative mw increased in the iodine rich groundwater in yr and hr the proportion of lmw organic compounds increased with increasing iodine concentration in the yr groundwater whereas they decreased in the hr groundwater the results suggest that different types of om may be utilized during iodine enrichment between yr and hr 4 discussion 4 1 different om degradation pathways promoting iodine enrichment in the yr and hr groundwater the δ13c dic values of groundwater in yr and hr differed between iodine rich and iodine depleted groundwater fig 3a collectively considering the relationship between δ13c dic and iodine concentration in fig 5 two distinct trends can be observed in both yr and hr groundwater which suggests that the accumulation of iodine in the groundwater of jhp may be supported by different om degradation pathways as shown in fig 5 δ13c dic values yr from 8 99 to 3 78 hr from 9 96 to 0 39 increased with increasing iodine concentration yr 8 03 1220 μg l hr 9 75 752 μg l in trend 1 and trend 4 probably due to intense om degradation proceeding to the stage of methanogenesis although different methane production pathways may occur including hydrogenotrophic acetotrophic and methylotrophic pathways all of them could result in lighter 12c enrichment in ch4 and heavier 13c production or residuals in groundwater dic blaser and conrad 2016 penger et al 2012 stopelli et al 2021 whiticar 1999 in addition the concentrations of nh4 and doc in trend 1 and trend 4 were higher than those in trend 2 and trend 3 fig 5a b d e du et al 2020 found a statistically significant correlation between ammonium and doc concentrations and δ13c dic values in ammonium rich groundwater around meandering banks or oxbow lakes along the main channel of yr du et al 2020 which is consistent with our results in other words the accumulation of iodine in the groundwater of jhp may also be related to the methanogenic process associated with the intense degradation of n containing om however the δ13c dic values were positive in only two iodine rich groundwater samples in hr therefore methanogenesis may not be the main process controlling the formation of iodine rich groundwater in hr the δ13c dic values yr from 10 1 to 24 3 hr from 10 7 to 17 5 decreased with increasing iodine concentration yr 1 46 1020 μg l hr 31 6 486 μg l in trend 2 and trend 3 fig 5 which is similar to the iodine rich groundwater in the north china plain xue et al 2019b this suggests that iodine enrichment is related to co2 production via microbially mediated degradation of om because this process preferentially expels the lighter 12c consequently the groundwater has lower δ13c dic and higher dic concentrations which may indicate a massive process of fermentation of om clark and fritz 1997 xue et al 2019b yang et al 2020b zhou et al 2018 in trend 2 doc concentration changed little with increasing iodine concentration whereas fe2 concentrations decreased further suggesting that iodine enrichment in groundwater may be related to the abiotic reduction of fe iii minerals promoted by hs generated during microbial sulfate reduction and then form the fes precipitation calculating the saturation index pyrite was found to be in oversaturated 19 85 23 55 which also supports the hypothesis the concentrations of nh4 and fe2 increased with increasing iodine concentration in trend 3 suggesting that the formation of iodine rich groundwater in hr may be related to the fermentation of om accompanied by the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxides possibly with nitrate reduction this result is consistent with those of previous studies in the datong basin and north china plain li et al 2020 li et al 2014 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2021b 4 2 effects of molecular weight on the degradation pathway of organic matter as previously discussed in section 3 3 iodine enrichment processes in the yr and hr groundwater may be attributed to the utilization of dom with various molecular weights in yr hmw organic compounds with higher aromaticity are preferentially biodegraded into lmw organic compounds which may promote the release of iodine into groundwater in hr the biodegradation of lmw organic compounds could be more favorable for iodine enrichment and result in residual hmw organic compounds in groundwater this speculation can be supported by the variation of iodine concentration with the spectral indices of dom in fig 4 we further analyzed the types of dom molecules in groundwater during methanogenesis and fermentation for two om degradation pathways identified in section 4 1 regarding the intense om degradation proceeding to the stage of methanogenesis trend 1 and trend 4 groundwater exhibited relatively higher suva254 and e2 e3 values compared to the fermentation stage but the sr values of methanogenesis and fermentation exhibited inverse trends between yr and hr fig 6 the sr values of the methanogenesis stage were lower than that of the fermentation stage in yr whereas the exactly opposite trend was observed in hr fig 6 this suggests that in the methanogenesis stage groundwater dom has higher aromaticity and lower relative molecular weight compared to the fermentation stage however in yr the proportion of lmw organic compounds in the methanogenesis stage was smaller than that in the fermentation stage whereas in hr the proportion of lmw organic compounds was larger in the fermentation stage as is well known anaerobic degradation of om is a step wise process involving multiple types of substrates transformation of particulate organic matter pom into dom of various molecular weights monomeric intermediates and terminal production of ch4 and co2 through hydrolysis and microbially mediated fermentation all of which are controlled by redox conditions gan et al 2020 middelburg et al 1993 zhuang et al 2019 microbiological companion studies on an arsenic contaminated aquifer in vietnam identified active and abundant microbial communities capable of fermentative metabolism glodowska et al 2021a glodowska et al 2021b moreover hydrolysis and fermentation products may also serve as substrates for microbial metabolism iron reduction sulfate reduction methanogenesis etc glodowska et al 2020 parkes et al 2000 an incubation experiment in anoxic marine sediments of the rhȏne river delta found that under sulfate reducing conditions microbes prefer to utilize initial hydrolysis and fermentation products of dom resulting in the accumulation of refractory humic like compounds in the aqueous phase but when the redox regime changes to methanogenic conditions they tend to utilize previously accumulated refractory compounds of the oxidized dom pool gan et al 2020 an experimental study on the biodegradation behaviors of petroleum hydrocarbons under various reducing conditions also found that the dominant process was the degradation of hmw polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons coupled with methanogenesis zhang et al 2019 in addition methanogens can utilize intermediates small volatile fatty acids acetic acid co2 h2 by biodegradable om through different metabolic pathways to produce methane wang et al 2021a zhuang et al 2019 these can support our results that in the yr groundwater hmw organic compounds are degraded to lmw via methanogenesis which promotes the release of iodine whereas in the hr groundwater the degradation of lmw organic compounds contributes to iodine enrichment resulting in the accumulation of aromatic compounds with hmw 4 3 iodine release promoted by the reduction of iron minerals with different degrees of crystallization the iron isotope in the iodine rich groundwater of yr area was lighter than that in the iodine depleted groundwater on the contrary the iron isotope in the iodine rich groundwater of hr was heavier than that in the iodine depleted groundwater fig 3b which may be attributable to two factors on the one hand the iron isotopes in iodine bound sediments in the yr aquifer are lighter than those in hr on the other hand differences in biogeochemical cycles associated with iodine enrichment in groundwater lead to different iron isotope fractionation between the two regions it is well known that fe ii can form abiotically during the reduction of different fe iii oxyhydr oxides by organic and inorganic compounds such as sulfides and phenolic substances and they can also form through the reduction of various fe iii oxyhydr oxides as well as fe iii ligand complexes by dissimilatory iron reducing microorganisms dirb huang et al 2021 therefore the fractionation of iron isotopes between fe ii in the aqueous phase and fe iii oxyhydr oxides is closely related to iron minerals beard et al 2010 wu et al 2011 wu et al 2010 wu et al 2012 in yr the δ56fe value of groundwater decreased with increasing fe2 concentration fig 7 a whereas in hr the δ56fe value of groundwater increased with increasing fe2 concentration fig 7b in general the lighter δ56fe could be produced by the reduction of fe iii oxyhydr oxides in an anoxic environment beard et al 2003 brantley et al 2004 bullen et al 2001 johnson et al 2008 nevertheless it is worth noting that only the mineral surface will be co controlled by the thermodynamics and kinetics of the solid liquid interface during the dissolution process thus after lighter iron isotopes of the minerals are preferentially released the remaining fe iii is enriched in the heavier iron isotopes with the continuous dissolution of minerals the subsequent δ56fe in the aqueous phase is larger than the initial δ56fe stumm and sulzberger 1992 tao et al 2022 wang et al 2014 wiederhold 2015 yang et al 2020a this may reasonably explain the different variation trends of fe2 and δ56fe in groundwater between yr and hr and support the conjecture that iodine bound sediments in the yr aquifer are lighter than that in hr the general trend for the isotope composition of fe minerals is as follows from isotopically light to heavy pyrite ankerite siderite mackinawite magnetite fe iii organic ligands poorly crystalline fe oxides goethite hematite and fe in silicate minerals guilbaud et al 2011 johnson et al 2003 wu et al 2019 fe oxides e g goethite hematite ferrihydrite are the main iron mineral phase in sediments 20 m below the surface in jhp duan et al 2017 duan et al 2019 schaefer et al 2017 therefore it is speculated that fe2 in the yr groundwater may be produced by the reductive dissolution of poorly crystallized amorphous iron oxides with relatively lower δ56fe this is potentially supported by the results of extraction experiments on water soluble organic matter and fe speciation in the swan island wetland of the middle reaches of yr which showed that fe om complexes amorphous iron oxides and hmw organic compounds are the main carrier of iodine in high iodine aquifers and the existence of hmw inhibits the crystallization of amorphous fe oxides xue et al 2022a however fe ii in hr groundwater may be produced by the reductive dissolution of goethite and hematite with higher δ56fe the contents of iron oxides with different degrees of crystallization in yr and hr sediments are shown in the si which can support our speculation the relationship between iodine and δ56fe shows a very interesting phenomenon fig 7c d in yr with increasing iodine concentration δ56fe decreases steeply and then flattens fig 7c the steep decrease of δ56fe may be caused by the biological reduction of poorly crystallized iron oxides but it does not result in the massive release of iodine then δ56fe tends to be flat which may be due to the degradation of hmw organic compounds promoting the reduction of poorly crystallized iron oxides resulting in large amounts of adsorbed iodine being released into groundwater as for hr two trends were observed fig 7d in one trend δ56fe decreases steeply with a slight increase in iodine concentration which is consistent with yr the reductive dissolution of poorly crystalline iron oxides does not result in a large amount of iodine release in the other trend with more iodine release the higher δ56fe decreased slowly suggesting that the abundance of iodine in groundwater is attributable to the reductive dissolution of strongly crystallized iron oxides with higher δ56fe therefore the degradation of om with different mws may drive the reductive dissolution of iron oxides with different degrees of crystallization and promote the release of iodine to groundwater in yr and hr a large number of studies investigating paddy soil or performing laboratory experiments of rice field soil as inocula reported that the addition of poorly crystallized amorphous fe iii oxide suppressed methanogenesis because anoxic conditions thermodynamically favor iron reduction over other metabolic pathways e g sulfate reduction or methanogenesis as well as the substrate competition between iron reducing bacteria irb and methanogens baek et al 2019 frenzel et al 1999 jackel and schnell 2000 kato et al 2012 lueders and friedrich 2002 qu et al 2004 zhou et al 2014 furthermore the activity of irb is dominant over methanogens in the presence of ferrihydrite because hco3 ch4 have more negative redox potential than fe iii fe ii zhou et al 2014 thus irb in anoxic habitats can outcompete methanogens and preferentially utilize various common electron donors acetate h2 to reduce fe iii release from poorly crystallized amorphous fe iii oxide inhibiting the methanogenesis process this appears to be contrary to the hypothesis of our research on the yr groundwater however yr iodine rich aquifer sediments in this study have higher content of hmw organic compounds instead of acetate or h2 added in the above experiment in addition the presence of hmw organic compounds and amorphous fe oxides can hinder direct electron transfer between fe iii and fe ii eusterhues et al 2008 as mentioned in section 4 2 the presence of hmw organic compounds polycyclic aromatics polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds in yr is more conducive to the occurrence of methanogenesis which in turn promotes the reduction of poorly crystallized amorphous fe iii oxide leading to the release of iodine collectively considering δ13c dic and dom uv visible spectral analysis above figs 3 6 this may also be the main process of iodine enrichment in the yr groundwater nevertheless irb preferentially use small molecular om to reduce crystalline fe iii oxide resulting in the release of iodine in hr 4 4 mechanisms of iodine enrichment in the alluvial lacustrine aquifer the results of this study clearly show that the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxides driven by the degradation of om with different molecular weights is a significant process with regard to iodine enrichment in aquifer systems which is co controlled by the crystallization degree of fe oxyhydr oxides and degradation pathway of om the findings suggest that iodine enrichment in the groundwater of yangtze river basin along yr and hr are co controlled by the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxides with different crystallizing degrees as well as the different degradation pathways of om with different molecular weights fig 8 shows a conceptual model incorporating the above mechanisms iron minerals in the yr aquifer sediments are mainly amorphous fe oxyhydr oxides and there are two different processes affecting iodine enrichment in groundwater 1 during methanogenesis the biodegradation of hmw organic compounds drives the reductive dissolution of amorphous fe oxyhydr oxides resulting in the release of large amounts of iodine which may be the predominant process of iodine enrichment in yr groundwater 2 om fermentation provides substrates for sulfate reduction and drives the abiotic reduction of amorphous fe oxyhydr oxides leading to the release of iodine into groundwater however iron minerals in hr aquifer sediments are mainly crystallized fe oxyhydr oxides microorganisms in groundwater use small molecular organic compounds produced during the fermentation and drive the biological reduction of crystallized fe oxyhydr oxides releasing iodine into groundwater in addition methanogenesis may also occur in the hr groundwater but it may not be the main process promoting the release of iodine unlike yr more small molecular organic compounds are involved in the methanogenesis in hr on the whole the concentration of iodine was higher in the yr groundwater than that in hr this may be explained by the protective mechanism of adsorption of om by poorly crystallized iron oxides chen et al 2014 wiseman and püttmann 2005 resulting in more iodine binding with fe om in sediments and subsequently releasing more iodine through the interaction of fe iii oxides and om furthermore iron reduction and methanogenesis were found to potentially promote the release of iodine in both yr and hr aquifers but the level of release differed which may be due to the significant difference in the degree of iron oxide crystallization and molecular composition of om between the two aquifer systems previous studies found that fe ii can catalyze amorphous fe oxides to transform into more thermodynamically stable phases e g goethite magnetite burton et al 2011 huang et al 2015 other studies have also found that amorphous fe oxides tend to adsorb hmw organic compounds lv et al 2016 while the existence of om could prevent the transformation of amorphous fe oxides to more stable iron mineral phases shimizu et al 2013 5 conclusions our field investigation results showed that high iodine groundwater in the central yangtze river basin mainly occurs along yr and hr with a maximum concentration of 1220 μg l which is closely related to the degradation of om and the reduction of fe oxides in this study dual stable inorganic carbon and iron isotopes combined with dom uv visible spectral characterization were firstly used to identify the dominant mechanisms controlling iodine enrichment of groundwater the results showed that two different controlling processes were identified between fe and om on iodine mobilization in alluvial lacustrine aquifer systems in yr methanogenesis driven by the biodegradation of hmw organic compounds can promote the reductive dissolution of amorphous fe oxyhydr oxides which is the predominant process controlling iodine release into yr groundwater in addition fermentation accompanied by sulfate reduction can also trigger the release of iodine into groundwater while in hr groundwater system iodine enrichment could be mainly attributed to the degradation of small molecule organic compounds generated through fermentation which promotes the reductive dissolution of crystalline iron hydroxide oxides overall the yr groundwater has significantly higher iodine concentration than hr which can be due to the high affinity of amorphous fe oxyhydr oxides for adsorbing iodine the subsequent reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxides promotes iodine release into groundwater this study provides novel insight into the mechanisms of iodine enrichment in the quaternary alluvial lacustrine aquifer by providing dual c fe isotopes evidence credit authorship

2397,reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxides triggered by biodegradation of organic matter om are considered to be key processes controlling iodine i release in groundwater systems however the precise mechanisms involved in release from organic matter degradation and from fe oxyhydr oxides are unclear in this study dual stable isotope analysis δ 13c and δ 56fe was combined with ultraviolet visible spectral characterization of dissolved organic matter to elucidate the mechanisms of iodine enrichment in groundwater of the central yangtze river basin china which represents quaternary alluvial lacustrine floodplains high iodine groundwater mainly occurs along the yangtze river yr and han river hr with a maximum concentration of 1220 μg l the results suggest that methanogenesis driven by the biodegradation of high molecular weight organic compounds can promote the reductive dissolution of amorphous fe oxyhydr oxides which is the predominant process controlling iodine enrichment in the yr groundwater system in addition fermentation accompanied by sulfate reduction can also trigger the release of iodine into groundwater the reductive dissolution of crystallized fe oxyhydr oxides driven by the fermentation of small molecule organic compounds is the dominant process responsible for iodine enrichment in the hr groundwater system this study provides novel insight into the mechanisms of iodine enrichment in quaternary alluvial lacustrine aquifers keywords iodine iron oxides organic matter carbon and iron isotopes alluvial lacustrine aquifer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction iodine i is an essential micronutrient for human beings ensuring normal thyroid functions at moderate amounts however both insufficient and excessive iodine intake can cause severe metabolic disturbances and lead to diseases with potential health consequences such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism taylor et al 2018 high iodine groundwater has been reported in many areas around the world posing a high potential risk to human thyroid function especially for the residents using groundwater as the main source of drinking water supply li et al 2013 pichel and vivar 2017 teng et al 2006 voutchkova et al 2017 voutchkova et al 2014 zhang et al 2021b in china excessive iodine intake from iodine rich groundwater affects a population of nearly 40 million in 11 provinces which has been shown to be associated with an increased prevalence of endemic goiter and hypothyroidism andersen et al 2009 shen et al 2011 thus understanding the mechanisms of iodine enrichment in groundwater is critical to eliminating the risk of exposure to high iodine contents and providing safe drinking water geogenic high iodine groundwater occurs mostly in arid semi arid inland basins and coastal areas wang et al 2021b recently our research group has first reported the occurrence of high iodine groundwater in the alluvial lacustrine plains along the middle reaches of the yangtze river luo et al 2022 xue et al 2022a 2021 however the potential mechanism of iodine enrichment in floodplain groundwater is poorly understood under reductive conditions the biodegradation of organic matter om and reductive dissolution of iron fe oxyhydr oxides are considered to be the key processes controlling iodine release in groundwater systems li et al 2014 li et al 2013 wang et al 2021b both om and fe oxyhydr oxides are considered to serve as significant hosts of iodine in sediments dai et al 2004 li et al 2013 nagata and fukushi 2010 nagata et al 2009 wang et al 2021b xu et al 2011 which may affect the spatial distribution of iodine in aquifer systems recently sequential extraction experiments of chemically active iodine in sediments increasingly showed that abundant iodine is bound to fe oxides in sediments xue et al 2022a b including exchangeable iodine adhered to the surface of metal hydr oxides and fe oxides associated iodine fractions laboratory incubation experiments have also revealed that reduction of fe oxyhydr oxides in natural sediments to fe ii can promote the transformation of fe minerals and lead to the release of iodine into groundwater li et al 2020 therefore fe and natural organic matter nom can jointly control the behavior of iodine in aquifer systems to some extent however the effects of the degradation pathway of nom and the crystallization degree of fe oxyhydr oxides on geogenic iodine enrichment in groundwater is still largely unknown better knowledge the precise mechanisms would improve our understanding of its role in iodine mobilization carbon isotopes δ13c can reveal the sources of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and the extent of om degradation in groundwater nowak et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 and they have been applied in the study of the formation mechanism of geogenic contaminated groundwater such as arsenic guo et al 2014 stopelli et al 2021 wang et al 2014 xie et al 2013a yang et al 2020b zhou et al 2018 ammonium du et al 2020 and phosphorus tao et al 2022 inorganic carbon isotopes have been applied for iodine rich groundwater in the north china plain ncp and the biodegradation process of om has been identified to have potential effects on iodine rich groundwater xue et al 2019b positive δ13c was detected in high ammonium groundwater of the central yangtze river basin indicating that the intensive degradation of om associated with methanogenesis led to the ammonium enrichment du et al 2020 stopelli et al 2021 comprehensively analyzed δ13c dic δ13c doc and δ13c ch4 and suggested that methane cycling could play an overlooked role in many arsenic rich aquifers around the world stopelli et al 2021 our research group recently used δ13c dic and found that the degradation of om with different molecular compositions through fermentation and methanogenesis could both promote iodine release into groundwater in the central yangtze river basin deng et al unpublished data but the effect of fe oxyhydr oxides was not considered fe isotopes can be used as a good indicator of the pathways and mechanisms of fe oxidation reduction precipitation dissolution and adsorption desorption in environments dauphas et al 2017 wu et al 2019 previous studies identified three pathways of coupled arsenic and iron cycling in high arsenic groundwater using fe isotopes including microbial fe iii reduction fe ii re adsorption and pyrite and siderite precipitation which can affect the migration and transformation of arsenic in aquifer systems guo et al 2013 wang et al 2014 xie et al 2013b xie et al 2014 yang et al 2020a c fe isotopes can be used in combination to reveal the effects of biogeochemical cycle of fe om on iodine in aquifer systems unfortunately thus far they have not been jointly used in studies on iodine enrichment in groundwater the jianghan plain jhp is a typical alluvial lacustrine plain with abundant om buried in aquifers hosting groundwater with high geogenic arsenic and ammonium deng et al 2018 du et al 2020 gan et al 2014 we firstly reported groundwater with high iodine concentrations reaching up to 1590 μg l in the central yangtze river basin luo et al 2022 in addition we hypothesized through extraction experiments that the interaction between fe oxides and om controlled iodine

to 17 the annual average evaporation and precipitation are 1200 mm and 1269 mm respectively according to our hydrogeological investigation the quaternary aquifer systems in jhp may comprise two units

shimadzu japan in the 200 700 nm wavelength range with an interval of 1 nm and ultrapure water as the blank the specific uv absorbance suva254 which is routinely used as an indicator of aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 was obtained by dividing the uv absorbance at 254 nm α254 m 1 by the doc concentration cdoc mg l of the corresponding water sample the e2 e3 ratio was calculated as the ratio of absorbance at 250 nm to 365 nm α254 α365 to track changes in the relative size of dom molecules the e2 e3 ratio decreased with increasing molecular size because of stronger light absorption by high molecular weight hmw om at longer wavelengths de haan and de boer 1987 helms et al 2008 timko et al 2015 the ratio of absorption spectral slopes sr can reflect the apparent molecular weights of dom helms et al 2008 timko et al 2015 spectral slopes for the intervals of 275 295 nm s275 295 and 350 400 nm s350 400 were calculated using the linear regression of the log transformed spectra and the slope ratio or sr was then calculated as the ratio of s275 295 to s350 400 which can be used to represent the ratio of lmw to hmw components in dom twardowski et al 2004 3 results 3 1 groundwater chemistry iodine concentration in the groundwater of jhp ranged from 0 001 to 1220 μg l with an average of 168 μg l the iodine concentration was higher than 100 μg l in 1 3 of the samples iodine rich groundwater 100 μg l is mainly distributed in the meandering banks of the yr and along hr in contrast the iodine concentration is relatively low in the straight river banks of yr and the center of jhp fig 1 focusing on the enrichment mechanism of high iodine groundwater along yr and hr in jhp the low iodine groundwater in the hinterland of the plain was excluded from the discussion in this study the major groundwater hydrochemical types in jhp were ca hco3 and ca mg hco3 the ph and eh values corrected to she of groundwater samples ranged from 6 50 to 7 86 average 7 27 median 7 37 and from 22 0 to 338 mv average 95 mv median 80 mv respectively the eh values of all iodine rich groundwater samples was 150 mv indicating that the reducing environment is conducive to iodine enrichment in groundwater the range of dissolved organic carbon doc in groundwater was 0 06 21 4 mg l with an average of 7 72 mg l and a median of 5 90 mg l the cl br mass ratio in groundwater samples ranged from 0 19 to 1700 with an average of 90 1 and a median of 8 36 as shown in fig 2 iodine concentration in groundwater along yr and hr both increased with doc concentration and the cl br mass ratio was mostly 50 which differ from the results of previous studies on high iodine groundwater in typical arid semi arid inland basins and coastal areas for instance the cl br molar ratios of the datong basin were 171 2656 with conversion mass ratios of 76 1180 li et al 2016 the cl br mass ratios of most areas in the cangzhou region of the north china plain were above 971 1 zhang et al 2021a the cl br molar ratios of the piedmont and central areas in the north china plain were 786 1120 conversion mass ratios of 349 498 with a relative standard deviation of 119 conversion mass ratio of 53 xue et al 2019a and the cl br molar ratios of the coastal plain of the north china plain were 147 2547 relative standard deviation of 535 with conversion mass ratios of 65 1132 relative standard deviation of 233 xue et al 2019a the cl br mass ratios of groundwater in jhp are lower than those in other areas which could be related to the degradation of om du et al 2018 mcarthur et al 2012 yang et al 2020b in addition according to fig 2a the doc concentration in the yr iodine rich groundwater was higher than hr the nh4 and fe2 concentrations of groundwater samples ranged from 0 01 to 40 0 mg l average 4 79 mg l median 2 70 mg l and from 0 02 to 22 3 mg l average 6 26 mg l median 6 00 mg l respectively there were no significant correlation between iodine concentration and nh4 and fe2 fig 2c 2d combined with the results of ph and eh in the yr and hr groundwater fig s1 it can be speculated that there may be complex biogeochemical processes affecting iodine enrichment in the yr and hr groundwater systems 3 2 isotope geochemistry stable inorganic carbon and iron isotope the inorganic carbon isotopic compositions δ13c dic of groundwater in jhp ranged from 24 3 to 3 78 specifically groundwater δ13c dic ranged from 24 3 to 3 78 along yr and from 17 5 to 0 39 in hr fig 3 a the δ13c dic value of the iodine rich groundwater i 100 μg l with an average of 10 9 in yr was higher than those of the iodine depleted groundwater average 13 0 on the contrary the δ13c dic value of the iodine rich groundwater with an average of 10 5 in hr was slightly lower than those of iodine depleted groundwater average 10 3 groundwater δ56fe in jhp varied from 3 89 to 0 43 ranging from 2 58 to 0 43 in yr and from 3 89 to 0 07 in hr fig 3b the δ56fe value of the iodine rich groundwater i 100 μg l with an average of 1 46 in yr was lower than that of iodine depleted groundwater average 0 47 on the contrary the δ56fe value of the iodine rich groundwater i 100 μg l with an average of 0 99 in hr was higher than that of iodine depleted groundwater average 1 37 the characteristics of both δ13c dic and δ56fe in the yr hr groundwater were different between iodine rich and iodine depleted groundwater and an inverse trend was observed between isotope and iodine concentration fig 3 this further indicates the possibility of different biogeochemical cycles affecting the behavior of iodine in the yr and hr groundwater 3 3 spectral indices of dom the suva254 e2 e3 and sr values of groundwater samples from yr ranged from 1 46 to 25 1 from 8 00 to 125 and from 0 07 to 1 43 respectively the suva254 e2 e3 and sr values of groundwater samples from hr varied from 5 19 to 55 3 from 19 7 to 410 and from 0 10 to 0 53 respectively the suva254 and e2 e3 values of groundwater in yr are lower than those in hr whereas the sr values are higher than those in hr this indicates that compared with hr groundwater the degree of aromaticity and relative mw of dom in the groundwater of yr are lower but the proportion of lmw organic compounds is higher further analysis of the relationship between the spectral indices of dom in groundwater and iodine concentration showed that with the increase of iodine concentration the e2 e3 values of groundwater in yr decreased and sr increased whereas suva254 showed no distinct variation pattern regarding the groundwater of hr suva254 e2 e3 and sr all decreased with iodine concentration fig 4 the degree of aromaticity of dom decreased and the relative mw increased in the iodine rich groundwater in yr and hr the proportion of lmw organic compounds increased with increasing iodine concentration in the yr groundwater whereas they decreased in the hr groundwater the results suggest that different types of om may be utilized during iodine enrichment between yr and hr 4 discussion 4 1 different om degradation pathways promoting iodine enrichment in the yr and hr groundwater the δ13c dic values of groundwater in yr and hr differed between iodine rich and iodine depleted groundwater fig 3a collectively considering the relationship between δ13c dic and iodine concentration in fig 5 two distinct trends can be observed in both yr and hr groundwater which suggests that the accumulation of iodine in the groundwater of jhp may be supported by different om degradation pathways as shown in fig 5 δ13c dic values yr from 8 99 to 3 78 hr from 9 96 to 0 39 increased with increasing iodine concentration yr 8 03 1220 μg l hr 9 75 752 μg l in trend 1 and trend 4 probably due to intense om degradation proceeding to the stage of methanogenesis although different methane production pathways may occur including hydrogenotrophic acetotrophic and methylotrophic pathways all of them could result in lighter 12c enrichment in ch4 and heavier 13c production or residuals in groundwater dic blaser and conrad 2016 penger et al 2012 stopelli et al 2021 whiticar 1999 in addition the concentrations of nh4 and doc in trend 1 and trend 4 were higher than those in trend 2 and trend 3 fig 5a b d e du et al 2020 found a statistically significant correlation between ammonium and doc concentrations and δ13c dic values in ammonium rich groundwater around meandering banks or oxbow lakes along the main channel of yr du et al 2020 which is consistent with our results in other words the accumulation of iodine in the groundwater of jhp may also be related to the methanogenic process associated with the intense degradation of n containing om however the δ13c dic values were positive in only two iodine rich groundwater samples in hr therefore methanogenesis may not be the main process controlling the formation of iodine rich groundwater in hr the δ13c dic values yr from 10 1 to 24 3 hr from 10 7 to 17 5 decreased with increasing iodine concentration yr 1 46 1020 μg l hr 31 6 486 μg l in trend 2 and trend 3 fig 5 which is similar to the iodine rich groundwater in the north china plain xue et al 2019b this suggests that iodine enrichment is related to co2 production via microbially mediated degradation of om because this process preferentially expels the lighter 12c consequently the groundwater has lower δ13c dic and higher dic concentrations which may indicate a massive process of fermentation of om clark and fritz 1997 xue et al 2019b yang et al 2020b zhou et al 2018 in trend 2 doc concentration changed little with increasing iodine concentration whereas fe2 concentrations decreased further suggesting that iodine enrichment in groundwater may be related to the abiotic reduction of fe iii minerals promoted by hs generated during microbial sulfate reduction and then form the fes precipitation calculating the saturation index pyrite was found to be in oversaturated 19 85 23 55 which also supports the hypothesis the concentrations of nh4 and fe2 increased with increasing iodine concentration in trend 3 suggesting that the formation of iodine rich groundwater in hr may be related to the fermentation of om accompanied by the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxides possibly with nitrate reduction this result is consistent with those of previous studies in the datong basin and north china plain li et al 2020 li et al 2014 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2021b 4 2 effects of molecular weight on the degradation pathway of organic matter as previously discussed in section 3 3 iodine enrichment processes in the yr and hr groundwater may be attributed to the utilization of dom with various molecular weights in yr hmw organic compounds with higher aromaticity are preferentially biodegraded into lmw organic compounds which may promote the release of iodine into groundwater in hr the biodegradation of lmw organic compounds could be more favorable for iodine enrichment and result in residual hmw organic compounds in groundwater this speculation can be supported by the variation of iodine concentration with the spectral indices of dom in fig 4 we further analyzed the types of dom molecules in groundwater during methanogenesis and fermentation for two om degradation pathways identified in section 4 1 regarding the intense om degradation proceeding to the stage of methanogenesis trend 1 and trend 4 groundwater exhibited relatively higher suva254 and e2 e3 values compared to the fermentation stage but the sr values of methanogenesis and fermentation exhibited inverse trends between yr and hr fig 6 the sr values of the methanogenesis stage were lower than that of the fermentation stage in yr whereas the exactly opposite trend was observed in hr fig 6 this suggests that in the methanogenesis stage groundwater dom has higher aromaticity and lower relative molecular weight compared to the fermentation stage however in yr the proportion of lmw organic compounds in the methanogenesis stage was smaller than that in the fermentation stage whereas in hr the proportion of lmw organic compounds was larger in the fermentation stage as is well known anaerobic degradation of om is a step wise process involving multiple types of substrates transformation of particulate organic matter pom into dom of various molecular weights monomeric intermediates and terminal production of ch4 and co2 through hydrolysis and microbially mediated fermentation all of which are controlled by redox conditions gan et al 2020 middelburg et al 1993 zhuang et al 2019 microbiological companion studies on an arsenic contaminated aquifer in vietnam identified active and abundant microbial communities capable of fermentative metabolism glodowska et al 2021a glodowska et al 2021b moreover hydrolysis and fermentation products may also serve as substrates for microbial metabolism iron reduction sulfate reduction methanogenesis etc glodowska et al 2020 parkes et al 2000 an incubation experiment in anoxic marine sediments of the rhȏne river delta found that under sulfate reducing conditions microbes prefer to utilize initial hydrolysis and fermentation products of dom resulting in the accumulation of refractory humic like compounds in the aqueous phase but when the redox regime changes to methanogenic conditions they tend to utilize previously accumulated refractory compounds of the oxidized dom pool gan et al 2020 an experimental study on the biodegradation behaviors of petroleum hydrocarbons under various reducing conditions also found that the dominant process was the degradation of hmw polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons coupled with methanogenesis zhang et al 2019 in addition methanogens can utilize intermediates small volatile fatty acids acetic acid co2 h2 by biodegradable om through different metabolic pathways to produce methane wang et al 2021a zhuang et al 2019 these can support our results that in the yr groundwater hmw organic compounds are degraded to lmw via methanogenesis which promotes the release of iodine whereas in the hr groundwater the degradation of lmw organic compounds contributes to iodine enrichment resulting in the accumulation of aromatic compounds with hmw 4 3 iodine release promoted by the reduction of iron minerals with different degrees of crystallization the iron isotope in the iodine rich groundwater of yr area was lighter than that in the iodine depleted groundwater on the contrary the iron isotope in the iodine rich groundwater of hr was heavier than that in the iodine depleted groundwater fig 3b which may be attributable to two factors on the one hand the iron isotopes in iodine bound sediments in the yr aquifer are lighter than those in hr on the other hand differences in biogeochemical cycles associated with iodine enrichment in groundwater lead to different iron isotope fractionation between the two regions it is well known that fe ii can form abiotically during the reduction of different fe iii oxyhydr oxides by organic and inorganic compounds such as sulfides and phenolic substances and they can also form through the reduction of various fe iii oxyhydr oxides as well as fe iii ligand complexes by dissimilatory iron reducing microorganisms dirb huang et al 2021 therefore the fractionation of iron isotopes between fe ii in the aqueous phase and fe iii oxyhydr oxides is closely related to iron minerals beard et al 2010 wu et al 2011 wu et al 2010 wu et al 2012 in yr the δ56fe value of groundwater decreased with increasing fe2 concentration fig 7 a whereas in hr the δ56fe value of groundwater increased with increasing fe2 concentration fig 7b in general the lighter δ56fe could be produced by the reduction of fe iii oxyhydr oxides in an anoxic environment beard et al 2003 brantley et al 2004 bullen et al 2001 johnson et al 2008 nevertheless it is worth noting that only the mineral surface will be co controlled by the thermodynamics and kinetics of the solid liquid interface during the dissolution process thus after lighter iron isotopes of the minerals are preferentially released the remaining fe iii is enriched in the heavier iron isotopes with the continuous dissolution of minerals the subsequent δ56fe in the aqueous phase is larger than the initial δ56fe stumm and sulzberger 1992 tao et al 2022 wang et al 2014 wiederhold 2015 yang et al 2020a this may reasonably explain the different variation trends of fe2 and δ56fe in groundwater between yr and hr and support the conjecture that iodine bound sediments in the yr aquifer are lighter than that in hr the general trend for the isotope composition of fe minerals is as follows from isotopically light to heavy pyrite ankerite siderite mackinawite magnetite fe iii organic ligands poorly crystalline fe oxides goethite hematite and fe in silicate minerals guilbaud et al 2011 johnson et al 2003 wu et al 2019 fe oxides e g goethite hematite ferrihydrite are the main iron mineral phase in sediments 20 m below the surface in jhp duan et al 2017 duan et al 2019 schaefer et al 2017 therefore it is speculated that fe2 in the yr groundwater may be produced by the reductive dissolution of poorly crystallized amorphous iron oxides with relatively lower δ56fe this is potentially supported by the results of extraction experiments on water soluble organic matter and fe speciation in the swan island wetland of the middle reaches of yr which showed that fe om complexes amorphous iron oxides and hmw organic compounds are the main carrier of iodine in high iodine aquifers and the existence of hmw inhibits the crystallization of amorphous fe oxides xue et al 2022a however fe ii in hr groundwater may be produced by the reductive dissolution of goethite and hematite with higher δ56fe the contents of iron oxides with different degrees of crystallization in yr and hr sediments are shown in the si which can support our speculation the relationship between iodine and δ56fe shows a very interesting phenomenon fig 7c d in yr with increasing iodine concentration δ56fe decreases steeply and then flattens fig 7c the steep decrease of δ56fe may be caused by the biological reduction of poorly crystallized iron oxides but it does not result in the massive release of iodine then δ56fe tends to be flat which may be due to the degradation of hmw organic compounds promoting the reduction of poorly crystallized iron oxides resulting in large amounts of adsorbed iodine being released into groundwater as for hr two trends were observed fig 7d in one trend δ56fe decreases steeply with a slight increase in iodine concentration which is consistent with yr the reductive dissolution of poorly crystalline iron oxides does not result in a large amount of iodine release in the other trend with more iodine release the higher δ56fe decreased slowly suggesting that the abundance of iodine in groundwater is attributable to the reductive dissolution of strongly crystallized iron oxides with higher δ56fe therefore the degradation of om with different mws may drive the reductive dissolution of iron oxides with different degrees of crystallization and promote the release of iodine to groundwater in yr and hr a large number of studies investigating paddy soil or performing laboratory experiments of rice field soil as inocula reported that the addition of poorly crystallized amorphous fe iii oxide suppressed methanogenesis because anoxic conditions thermodynamically favor iron reduction over other metabolic pathways e g sulfate reduction or methanogenesis as well as the substrate competition between iron reducing bacteria irb and methanogens baek et al 2019 frenzel et al 1999 jackel and schnell 2000 kato et al 2012 lueders and friedrich 2002 qu et al 2004 zhou et al 2014 furthermore the activity of irb is dominant over methanogens in the presence of ferrihydrite because hco3 ch4 have more negative redox potential than fe iii fe ii zhou et al 2014 thus irb in anoxic habitats can outcompete methanogens and preferentially utilize various common electron donors acetate h2 to reduce fe iii release from poorly crystallized amorphous fe iii oxide inhibiting the methanogenesis process this appears to be contrary to the hypothesis of our research on the yr groundwater however yr iodine rich aquifer sediments in this study have higher content of hmw organic compounds instead of acetate or h2 added in the above experiment in addition the presence of hmw organic compounds and amorphous fe oxides can hinder direct electron transfer between fe iii and fe ii eusterhues et al 2008 as mentioned in section 4 2 the presence of hmw organic compounds polycyclic aromatics polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds in yr is more conducive to the occurrence of methanogenesis which in turn promotes the reduction of poorly crystallized amorphous fe iii oxide leading to the release of iodine collectively considering δ13c dic and dom uv visible spectral analysis above figs 3 6 this may also be the main process of iodine enrichment in the yr groundwater nevertheless irb preferentially use small molecular om to reduce crystalline fe iii oxide resulting in the release of iodine in hr 4 4 mechanisms of iodine enrichment in the alluvial lacustrine aquifer the results of this study clearly show that the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxides driven by the degradation of om with different molecular weights is a significant process with regard to iodine enrichment in aquifer systems which is co controlled by the crystallization degree of fe oxyhydr oxides and degradation pathway of om the findings suggest that iodine enrichment in the groundwater of yangtze river basin along yr and hr are co controlled by the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxides with different crystallizing degrees as well as the different degradation pathways of om with different molecular weights fig 8 shows a conceptual model incorporating the above mechanisms iron minerals in the yr aquifer sediments are mainly amorphous fe oxyhydr oxides and there are two different processes affecting iodine enrichment in groundwater 1 during methanogenesis the biodegradation of hmw organic compounds drives the reductive dissolution of amorphous fe oxyhydr oxides resulting in the release of large amounts of iodine which may be the predominant process of iodine enrichment in yr groundwater 2 om fermentation provides substrates for sulfate reduction and drives the abiotic reduction of amorphous fe oxyhydr oxides leading to the release of iodine into groundwater however iron minerals in hr aquifer sediments are mainly crystallized fe oxyhydr oxides microorganisms in groundwater use small molecular organic compounds produced during the fermentation and drive the biological reduction of crystallized fe oxyhydr oxides releasing iodine into groundwater in addition methanogenesis may also occur in the hr groundwater but it may not be the main process promoting the release of iodine unlike yr more small molecular organic compounds are involved in the methanogenesis in hr on the whole the concentration of iodine was higher in the yr groundwater than that in hr this may be explained by the protective mechanism of adsorption of om by poorly crystallized iron oxides chen et al 2014 wiseman and püttmann 2005 resulting in more iodine binding with fe om in sediments and subsequently releasing more iodine through the interaction of fe iii oxides and om furthermore iron reduction and methanogenesis were found to potentially promote the release of iodine in both yr and hr aquifers but the level of release differed which may be due to the significant difference in the degree of iron oxide crystallization and molecular composition of om between the two aquifer systems previous studies found that fe ii can catalyze amorphous fe oxides to transform into more thermodynamically stable phases e g goethite magnetite burton et al 2011 huang et al 2015 other studies have also found that amorphous fe oxides tend to adsorb hmw organic compounds lv et al 2016 while the existence of om could prevent the transformation of amorphous fe oxides to more stable iron mineral phases shimizu et al 2013 5 conclusions our field investigation results showed that high iodine groundwater in the central yangtze river basin mainly occurs along yr and hr with a maximum concentration of 1220 μg l which is closely related to the degradation of om and the reduction of fe oxides in this study dual stable inorganic carbon and iron isotopes combined with dom uv visible spectral characterization were firstly used to identify the dominant mechanisms controlling iodine enrichment of groundwater the results showed that two different controlling processes were identified between fe and om on iodine mobilization in alluvial lacustrine aquifer systems in yr methanogenesis driven by the biodegradation of hmw organic compounds can promote the reductive dissolution of amorphous fe oxyhydr oxides which is the predominant process controlling iodine release into yr groundwater in addition fermentation accompanied by sulfate reduction can also trigger the release of iodine into groundwater while in hr groundwater system iodine enrichment could be mainly attributed to the degradation of small molecule organic compounds generated through fermentation which promotes the reductive dissolution of crystalline iron hydroxide oxides overall the yr groundwater has significantly higher iodine concentration than hr which can be due to the high affinity of amorphous fe oxyhydr oxides for adsorbing iodine the subsequent reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxides promotes iodine release into groundwater this study provides novel insight into the mechanisms of iodine enrichment in the quaternary alluvial lacustrine aquifer by providing dual c fe isotopes evidence credit authorship

2398,riverine nutrient fluxes are of great implications for marine ecosystems however there is a lack of knowledge on the source to sink process of nutrient fluxes particularly the total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn in the yangtze river and its adjacent sea thus this study provides historic changes in riverine nutrient fluxes to the sea over the past 70 years and tries to figure out their response to catchment related factors and potential ecological influence on the sea during the past two decades it is found that the process of the nutrient flux to the sea over the past 70 years can be divided into three stages as a low level stage before 1980 a rapid developing stage after reform and opening up and a final stage under government regulation based on our detailed measurements in the recent two decades 2004 2020 the increasing trends of the riverine nutrient fluxes have slowed down and the tp and tn fluxes averaged 0 09 0 02 and 1 61 0 23 mt yr respectively 12 2 and 4 8 smaller than the previous five year 1999 2003 averages the seasonal characteristics of the nutrient fluxes primarily reflected the controlling effect of the yangtze river water discharge and the overall interannual characteristics of the nutrient fluxes were related to the fertilizer use in the catchment over the past two decades the annual frequency and area of red tides occurring in the east china sea averaged 38 red tides and 5120 km2 respectively the major red tides single area 100 km2 mainly occurred between march and september and peaked in may 50 0 and 57 9 of the total frequency and area respectively the intensity of red tides had a relatively decent reaction to the nutrient fluxes in may but also exhibited some uncertainties affected by some other important influencing factors this study supplies a more continuous accurate and detailed field measured dataset of tp and tn fluxes from the yangtze river to the ocean and assists in exploring the potential linkage between the maritime red tides and riverine nutrient fluxes keywords yangtze river total phosphorus total nitrogen fertilizer use red tides data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river material flux is an important linkage between the continents and oceans milliman and farnsworth 2011 human activities and climatic changes within catchments affect marine environments via river fluxes over the past decades numerous studies have examined the riverine water and sediment changes and their impacts on estuaries and deltas giosan et al 2014 yang et al 2018 2020 in comparison less is known about riverine nutrient fluxes in particular those based on systematic observation nitrogen n and phosphorus p are indispensable elements for the growth and reproduction of marine organisms thereby affecting the estuaries and coastal ecosystems among many nutrient sources to the sea the transport of fluvial materials is recognized as a vital pathway that delivers large amounts of nutrients and significantly influences the global biogeochemical cycling of elements in adjacent seas walsh 1991 seitzinger et al 2010 kim et al 2021 beusen et al 2022 for example the amazon river provides 25 of the total nitrogen tn to the north atlantic ocean howarth et al 1996 however due to the increasing intensified anthropogenic activities in basins riverine nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry changes may modify the structure of nutrients resulting in eutrophication and the subsequent degradation of estuarine ecosystems turner and rabalais 1994 ludwig et al 2009 wu et al 2019 in recent centuries increasing riverine n and p inputs to the ocean due to industrialization agricultural practices and wastewater have been reported to have dramatic consequences for ecosystems worldwide bouwman et al 2005 beusen et al 2016 maavara et al 2020a globally damming decoupled the global river fluxes of n and p and increased the n p ratios delivered to the coastal zone increasing the potential for p limitations on coastal productivity maavara et al 2020b in the mississippi river because of a consistent increase in the use of chemical fertilizer nitrate and phosphorus concentrations increased 3 4 times from 1950 to 2000 which may have contributed to coastal eutrophication and hypoxia justić et al 2002 rabalais and turner 2019 in addition fertilizer loss and sewage effluents mainly contributed to the nitrogen and phosphorus in the yellow river but dam construction and phytoplankton uptake significantly lowered nutrient concentrations wu et al 2021 therefore riverine nutrient concentrations and fluxes are seriously influenced by human activities and change coastal ecological environments so they need to be clearly addressed chinese rivers output approximately 5 10 of the total surface runoff to the global ocean and the yangtze changjiang river fig 1 is the largest river in terms of both water discharge 900 km3 yr and length 6300 km on the eurasian continent thus it plays a fundamental role in the continental inputs to chinese coastal zones gao and wang 2008 wu et al 2019 like other rivers globally the yangtze river is also undergoing many stressors from anthropogenic activities such as dam construction rapid population growth agricultural practices and urbanization fig 1c especially in the last two decades yang et al 2014 luo et al 2018 in the east china sea where the yangtze river empties frequent harmful algal blooms have become the most serious eco environmental problem and even once accounted for 89 of reported events in all chinese coastal areas in the early 20th century li et al 2014 liu et al 2018 2022a b thus the variation in and transport of nutrients from the yangtze river to the sea are long standing concerns that significantly affect coastal water ecosystems dai et al 2011 presented early remarkable upwards trends of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate during 1955 2008 from the yangtze river to the sea exhibiting the influence of the population increase and the use of large scale chemical fertilizers in the catchment fig 1c which could have caused an increased red tide bloom one type of harmful algal bloom and decreased dissolved oxygen in the changjiang estuary recently zhang et al 2021 also demonstrated increases in seaward nutrient fluxes in the yangtze river driven by human migration and land use changes however most existing studies of nutrient transport from the yangtze river have primarily focused on dissolved inorganic nutrients xu et al 2013 liang and xian 2018 ge et al 2020 but there has been little research on tn and total phosphorus tp both of them include inorganic and organic components support phytoplankton growth and have implications for algal blooms wang et al 2019 showed that the mean fluxes of tn and tp from the yangtze river were 1 69 million ton year mt yr and 0 11 mt yr respectively based on a 5 year dataset subsequently the exploration of whether the nutrient fluxes were affected by the three gorges reservoir tgr and the south to north water transfer project was conducted based on longer timescale data with high uncertainties established by a numerical model wang et al 2020 liu et al 2018 also explored the spatiotemporal changes in the yangtze river tn and tp flux exports to the east china sea but did not provide implications for the eco environment in the estuary and adjacent waters overall the yangtze river basin has experienced rapid ecological environment changes that are difficult to address particularly after 2000 when they greatly affected the marine environment of the east china sea li et al 2007 liu et al 2018 in addition environmental protection awareness in china has gradually increased strokal et al 2017 therefore to date it is still urgent for us to address the variations in the nutrients flowing from the yangtze river to the sea and the perspective of the human society ecological environment in the present study consecutive monthly data of the nutrients tn and tp and hydrological variables with high precision and temporal resolution for the past 20 years 2000 2020 were collected at the xuliujing station in the yangtze estuary fig 1 the key hydrological station nearest to the entrance of the east china sea we therefore aimed to reveal the historic changes in tn and tp fluxes from the yangtze river to the sea during the past 70 years in combination of published data and then estimate the driving factors in society and environment we also evaluated the potential role of riverine nutrients in the red tides in coastal marine ecosystems aiming to provide references for policy makers who are attempting to manage the estuarine environment 2 study area the yangtze river rises in the qinghai tibet plateau and flows eastward into the east china sea fig 1 with a length of 6300 km a catchment area of 1 8 106 km2 and a human population in its catchment

1 the yangtze estuary in a broad sense refers to the reach from the datong station tidal limit to the subaqueous delta fig 1b downward of the xuliujing station fig 1b the estuary is separated into four outlets that makes the xuliujing station a key site monitoring the riverine outputs to the sea the east china sea fig 1a is a wide and relatively shallow marginal sea with an area of 77 104 km2

xuliujing station between 2000 and 2020 and there was a lack of tp and tn data between 2000 and 2003 the water samples were collected by a stainless steel sampler and detected according to the technical specifications requirements for monitoring of surface water and waste water by the ministry of environmental protection china the concentrations of do were determined using electrochemical

spectrophotometric method with a detection limit of 0 01 mg l gb t 11893 89 the national standard of the people s republic of china wang et al 2020 the monthly nutrient flux to the sea was the product of the concentration and the corresponding monthly water discharge at datong station and the annual nutrient fluxes were the total amounts of all the months in a whole year for the measurements in this study the errors of annual nutrient fluxes were estimated as the products of the annual water discharge and the errors in the concentration detection for the annual tp and tn fluxes before 2003 reported by wang et al 2020 the errors were usually between 18 8 and 22 3 simplified as 20 according to the differences between the measured and simulated data data on population effective irrigation

centralized pollution control facilities the data of the main provinces that the yangtze river flows through fig 1 were accumulated to roughly represent the total amount of the yangtze river basin the annual frequency and area of red tide occurring in the east china sea fig 1c were obtained from the bulletin of china marine disasters 2000 2020 by the ministry of natural resources of the people s republic of china available at http www mnr gov cn a major red tide was defined as a red tide with a single area 100 km2 according to the bulletin of china marine disasters 2000 2020 and was counted

historic changes in the nutrient fluxes along with the social development a simulated multi year dataset 1950 2003 accurate to a year of the tp and tn fluxes by wang et al 2020 considering the population density gross domestic product rainfall cultivated area and agricultural water consumption etc was assembled with our detailed data in this study 2004 2020 accurate to a month to analyze the long term variation based on our own calculation the relative errors averaged 8 91 9 07 and 6 83 5 95 for tp and tn fluxes respectively according to the differences between our measured data and their simulated data during the same period from 2004 to 2016 fig s1 some extremely high values in the nutrient fluxes reflected the control of extreme summer floods such as the intra fluctuations in 1954 1983 1998 2016 and 2020 green dashed circles in fig 2 and were ignored in the following analysis the progresses of the nutrient fluxes can be divided into 3 stages as an initial stage 1950 1979 in low level development before 1980 a rapid developing stage 1980 2002 after the reform and opening up and a final stage 2003 2020 under government regulation of nutrient output in transition from increasing to steady or even recent decreasing states similar trends were also detected in the evolution process of the dissolved inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen fluxes zhang et al 2021 there were no evident trends in the initial stage for either the tp or tn fluxes p 0 05 fig 2 which averaged 6 82 0 92 104 t yr and 112 35 14 97 104 t yr respectively after the reform and opening up since the early 1980s the development of population urbanization industry and agriculture etc all accelerated in the basin fig 1c and both the tp 8 95 1 07 104 t yr and tn 148 36 17 56 104 t yr fluxes changed to significant increases p 0 01 fig 2 the mean fluxes of tp and tn increased from 8 78 0 69 104 t yr and 145 39 11 05 104 t yr of the first five years to 10 09 1 05 104 t yr and 168 28 15 45 104 t yr of the last five years respectively in the final stage of the recent two decades no particular trends were found in the interannual changes of the tp and tn fluxes p 0 05 fig 2 the mean averages of the tp and tn fluxes of the first five years 8 36 2 40 104 t yr and 149 13 17 53 104 t yr respectively after the tgr decreased by 17 1 and 11 4 compared with the last five year averages of before the tgr and the tp and tn fluxes in the dry season went up with a mean rate of 28 3 due to the regulation on seasonal re distribution of water discharge by the tgr wang et al 2020 4 2 changes in the nutrient fluxes and other variables during the past two decades 4 2 1 interannual trends for the past 20 years the tp and tn concentrations averaged 0 10 0 03 and 1 87 0 33 mg l respectively no particular trends were found in either the tp or tn concentrations fig 3 b1 c1 p 0 05 fig s2a1 b1 while the seasonal fluctuations within a year in both the tp and tn concentrations became much smaller during recent years fig 3b1 c1 based on detailed analysis the standard deviations of annual tp and tn concentrations averages of monthly values both exhibited significant decreasing trends over the past two decades p 0 01 p 0 05 fig s2a2 b2 the mean fluxes of tp and tn for the past 20 years were 0 75 0 42 104 ton month t mth and 13 38 6 40 104 t mth respectively and the latter was 18 times larger than the former some extreme values in the fluxes of tp and tn dashed green circles in fig 3b1 c1 were found to be related to extreme summer floods dashed green circles in fig 3a1 for example 2 24 104 t of tp in july 2010 and 36 58 104 t of tn in july 2016 the water discharge showed no evident interannual trend and averaged 884 117 km3 yr during the past 20 years fig 3a2 unlike the water discharge the annual sediment discharge showed a distinct decreasing trend with some fluctuations p 0 01 after 2003 when the tgr began operating fig 3a2 declining from 340 mt in 2000 to only 72 mt in 2011 table 1 no particular trend was found for the tp flux p 0 05 but a significant increasing trend was found for the tn flux p 0 01 at the interannual scale fig 3b2 c2 the annual fluxes of the tp and tn from the yangtze river to the sea averaged 0 09 0 02 mt yr and 1 61 0 23 mt yr respectively the multiyear averages of the tp and tn fluxes in this study were quite close to the values 0 11 and 1 69 mt yr respectively by wang et al 2019 based on a short 5 year dataset in addition our results are 1 7 and 1 1 times larger than the dissolved inorganic phosphorus 1 66 109 mol yr equal to 0 05 mt yr and nitrogen 108 109 mol yr equal to 1 51 mt yr respectively multiyear averages between 2004 and 2015 reported by zhang et al 2021 4 2 2 seasonal variations significant seasonal variation in the water discharge at datong station from the yangtze river to the ocean was detected during the past 20 years fig 3a1 averagely ranging from 357 86 108 m3 month m3 mth in february to 1307 293 108 m3 mth in july fig 4 a with the monthly maximum occurring in july 2020 at 1920 108 m3 due to the regulation of the water discharge between the flood and dry seasons by the large reservoirs for example the tgr and some cascade reservoirs in the upper yangtze river the five year averages of water discharge in january increased from 365 102 108 m3 for 2000 2004 to 464 82 108 m3 for 2016 2020 a total increase of 27 in january at the same time the water discharge in the flood seasons was often intensified by extreme summer floods such as 1639 108 m3 in july 2010 1766 108 m3 in july 2016 and 1922 108 m3 in july 2020 dashed green circles in fig 3a1 the sediment discharge from the yangtze river which is highly related to the water discharge showed the same seasonal characteristics figs 3a1 and 4a as high as 10 400 104 tons in july 2000 and as low as 90 104 tons in february 2017 do is an important indicator to judge the quality of water bodies such as rivers or estuaries the concentration of do at xuliujing station presented evident seasonal variation from 2000 to 2020 usually varying from 6 mg l in the flood seasons to 12 mg l in the dry seasons fig s3 although the concentrations of tp and tn lack of data before 2003 did not present evident seasonal variations the fluxes of tp and tn still showed evident seasonal characteristics figs 3b1 c1 and 4b c the seasonal variations in the nutrient fluxes mainly reflected the controlling effect of seasonal water discharges usually against relatively stable nutrient concentrations liu and shen 2001 zhang et al 2003 4 3 recent response of nutrient fluxes to anthropogenic activities the nutrient fluxes to the sea were highly correlated with the fertilizer use fig 1c in the basin because of government regulation during the past two decades the yangtze river basin hosts more than 40 of the nation s population and is one of the most important agricultural regions in china liu et al 2022a b the population and effective irrigation area of the provinces that the yangtze river flows through exhibited both significant increasing trends p 0 001 growing from 476 million in 2000 to 512 million in 2020 and from 18 9 million hectares in 2000 to 23 5 million hectares in 2020 respectively fig 5 a according to the method using the function findchangepts in matlab software to detect abrupt changes and partition data into different periods both the phosphate and nitrogen fertilizer used in these provinces synchronously consisted of three different periods that was the first period with significant increasing trends p 0 001 for both a second period with decreasing trends insignificant for phosphate fertilizer p 0 05 and significant for nitrogenous fertilizer p 0 01 and a last dramatic period with significant decreasing trends p 0 001 for both fig 5b c the second periods of phosphate and nitrogenous fertilizer started in different years which were 2013 and 2011 for phosphate and nitrogenous fertilizer respectively while the third periods of phosphate and nitrogenous fertilizer both started in 2016 fig 5b c the current level of fertilizer used in the drainage basin in 2020 was even much lower than that in 2000 fig 5b c despite the continuous increase in the population and effective irrigation area the fertilizer used in the provinces that the yangtze river flows through showed different evolving processes there have been sharp and continuous declines in agricultural fertilizer use in the drainage basin since 2016 fig 5b c similar n and p flux trends were also observed in the yellow river wu et al 2021 this phenomenon was consistent with a previous analysis and was probably related to the plan of zero growth in fertilizer by 2020 by the chinese ministry of agriculture ma et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 reflecting the chinese government regulation on nutrient pollution to the coastal waters wang et al 2021 to maintain the consistency comparability and reliability of the data only the measurements from 2004 to 2020 in this study were adopted in the analysis of the past two decades an overall increasing trend p 0 01 with fluctuations was found for the tn flux during the past two decades but not for tp flux p 0 05 fig 5b c in contrast to the second period of decreases in fertilizer the nutrient flux didn t show a decreasing response fig 5b c probably due to the large amount of accumulated fertilizer dissolved in the basin over years the fluctuations of riverine tp and tn fluxes to the ocean became larger during recent years and the decreases between 2016 and 2018 dashed blue arrows were probably related to the dramatic declines in agricultural fertilizer since 2016 fig 5b c the conversions of fertilizer and nutrients were synchronized with each other after 2018 the fluxes of tn and tp recovered a little bit fig 5b c and were possibly related to the extreme summer floods in 2020 the temporal changing processes of the fluxes were accompanied by fluctuations back and forth demonstrating that in addition to agricultural inputs the yangtze river s fluxes to the ocean were also highly influenced by other factors such as industrial contributions land use changes urbanization and sewage discharges fig 1c gao and wang 2008 deng et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 for example both the sewage induced tp and tn fluxes discharged from the yangtze basin had increased for decades before 2010 liu et al 2018 while they stopped increasing after 2011 fig s4 primarily attributed to the government dominated enhanced n management in aquatic systems wang et al 2021 and reduction in fertilizer use fig 5b c ma et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 during the past decade even so the sewage induced tp and tn fluxes discharged from the yangtze basin still stayed at a relatively high level with no significant temporal trends p 0 05 fig s4 and respectively averaged 13 43 3 23 104 t yr and 122 69 14 54 104 t yr for the past decade which might contribute much to the riverine nutrients to the sea in fact in addition to the yangtze river similar temporal trends in coastal eutrophication occurred in all of china s near shore area over several decades showing the response to significant upwards trends in n and p fluxes from rivers influenced by human activities wu et al 2021 4 4 potential linkage to the red tide in the east china sea with the large amount of and rapid increases in nutrients from the yangtze river nutrient composition and concentrations were modified in the coastal sea thereby increasing the frequency of harmful algal blooms such as red tides according to the bulletin of china marine disasters and a previous study he et al 2022 most of the red tides in the east china sea occur in coastal waters meanwhile based on xu et al 2012 when the yangtze s water sediment and nutrients come out from the estuary large portions of them were transported southward by the coastal current along the inner continental shelf of the east china sea which means that the coastal waters of the east china sea are affected by the yangtze s output therefore most red tides in the east china sea occur in coastal waters that are always affected by the yangtze river fresh water according to the data from the bulletin of china marine disasters the annual frequency of red tides occurring in the east china sea varied from 11 to 86 fig 6 a and averaged 38 19 over the past 20 years at the same time the annual area of red tides varied from 1100 km2 to 15 200 km2 fig 6a and averaged 5120 4470 km2 as expected the frequency and the area of red tides were positively correlated with each other r 0 757 based on correlation analysis there were no good correlations between the annual frequency of red tides and the annual fluxes of wd r 0 148 sd r 0 045 tp r 0 352 and tn r 0 339 a major red tide in this study was defined as a red tide with a single area larger than 100 km2 this was different from previous studies in that a major red tide was usually defined as a red tide with 1 million cells per liter of seawater mainly focusing on cell concentrations of harmful algae liu et al 2016 weisberg et al 2018 based on the statistical analysis the red tides in the east china sea were primarily the major red tides fig 6a considering that the ratio of the annual area of major red tides to the total annual area averaged 73 9 the area of major red tides red empty circles evolved in the same manner as the total red tides fig 6a which consisted of an insignificant increase before 2005 p 0 05 and a significant decrease after 2006 p 0 01 fig 6b according to the method using the function findchangepts in matlab software according to the temporal distribution of the major red tides with tp and tn during the past 20 years major red tides usually occurred periodically consistent with the peak values of tp and tn in annual late spring and early summer fig 6b c further analysis of the frequency and area of major red tides revealed that major red tides occurred between march and september and peaked in may fig 7 a based on our statistical analysis the frequency and area of red tides in may accounted for 50 0 and 57 9 of the total major red tides in the past 20 years respectively may when is important enough for red tides was a good indicator to help filter out or weaken the impacts from some other factors such as seasonal water discharge and temperature the intensity of the annual major red tides had a relatively decent reaction to the fluxes of tp and tn in may for example the nutrient fluxes and area of major red tides in may between 2015 and 2020 represented a certain consistency in the transitions between the peak and trough values fig 7b no major red tides occurred in may 2007 fig 7b probably owing to the extremely low tp flux in may the solid blue circle in fig 7b however there were also some inconsistent variations between the nutrient fluxes and area of major red tides in may being hard to explain such as the inconsistency between 2011 and 2014 fig 7b besides under comparable levels of tp and tn fluxes the total area of annual major red tides in may sharply decreased from thousands of square kilometers before 2010 to usually only hundreds of square kilometers after 2011 fig 7b this phenomenon was in consistence with the declining trends of seawater areas with eutrophic status and the frequency of harmful algal blooms in chinese coastal waters over the last decade primarily attributed to the enhanced n management to control n pollution in aquatic systems by the chinese government since 2010 wang et al 2021 these uncertainties reflected that riverine nutrient supply was a vital but not the only factor for red tides and there were some other important influencing factors in particular not all the red tides in the east china sea occurred in the area affected by the yangtze river fresh water as to the riverine nutrient flux to the ocean riverine sediment can also be a nutrient source that is desorbed from the suspended sediment during transport from the river to coastal zones dai et al 2011 besides changes in sediment fluxes can reflect some anthropogenic activities in the basin i e the tgr that affect nutrient loads to the estuary notably wang et al 2020 but additional measurements are needed as to the intensity of red tides in the east china sea it could also be influenced by many other factors such as ph water temperature illumination intensity water stratification mixing and coastal upwelling may et al 2003 lou et al 2012 huang et al 2021 he et al 2022 for example the decline in the suspended sediment concentration in the yangtze estuary and adjacent coastal waters improved water clarity strengthened illumination intensity and photosynthesis and thus increased the intensity of red tides may et al 2003 huang et al 2022 at the same time in the yangtze estuary deflected river plume extensions after mega estuarine constructions could also have redistributed the suspended sediment concentration and nutrients thereby changing the location of red tides he et al 2022 from the perspective of nutrient sources considering the restrictions on fertilizer use in the yangtze river basin there were no distinct increasing trends but decreasing trends to a certain extent of the tp and tn fluxes in may fig 7c1 d1 the tp and tn fluxes in may were primarily dominated by the water discharge with correlation coefficients r being 0 732 and 0 622 respectively fig 7c2 d2 particularly in recent years the fluxes of tp and tn even showed perfectly consistent phased variations with the water discharge fig 7c1 d1 therefore the current trend of the red tides in the east china sea in may playing a significant role in determining the trend for the whole year is highly influenced by the water discharge in may from the yangtze river in addition global climate change has increased the frequency of extreme events in the yangtze river basin such as severe floods and droughts which impacts the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles gradually and evidently and robust and in depth research in the future is warranted this is a preliminary estimation of the yangtze river s output of nutrients to the sea and it still contains several gaps the nutrient fluxes to the ocean in this study mainly reflected the yangtze river output upstream of the xuliujing station downstream of the xuliujing station the output of nutrient fluxes from coastal cities particularly from the mega city shanghai fig 1b to the estuary could also be a considerable amount based on zhang et al 2021 the nutrient fluxes from the delta could account for as much as 5 20 of the yangtze river s total output 4 5 comparison with other large global river systems large rivers play a vital role in transporting nutrients to the ocean milliman and farnsworth 2011 based on a snapshot of many sites in the upper mississippi missouri and ohio rivers the concentrations of tn and tp were 0 181 and 2 112 mg l 0 171 and 0 978 mg l and 0 053 and 1 152 mg l respectively hill et al 2011 which are on the same order of magnitude as the multiyear average of those in the yangtze river as 0 103 and 1 868 mg l in this study in addition the tn flux from the mississippi river basin to the gulf of mexico is 1 56 mt yr goolsby and battaglin 2010 stackpoole et al 2021 which is slightly smaller than that from the yangtze river 1 61 0 23 mt yr for the past 20 years in contrast the flux of tn from the amazon river to the north atlantic ocean is 3 3 mt yr howarth et al 1996 which is twice as large as that from the yangtze river however a recent study conducted between 2011 and 2013 revealed a sharp decrease in the tn flux to 1 96 mt yr drake et al 2021 which was still 22 larger than that of the yangtze river different from those in inshore waters that are controlled by riverine input the nutrient concentrations in offshore waters could be largely affected by atmospheric deposition in korean coastal waters kim et al 2013 in amazon shelf waters algal blooms are largely sustained by the nutrient fluxes from the shoreward movement of ocean water as well as riverine supply demaster and pope 1996 these other sources of nutrient fluxes could also contribute greatly to the ocean and increase the uncertainty in the occurrence of algal blooms sometimes even under the circumstance of a decline in the total nutrient flux a change in nutrient type could still lead to severe ecological issues in the gulf of mexico the algal production induced hypoxic zone which has attracted a great amount of attention goolsby 2000 liu et al 2010 increased between 1997 and 2007 against the decline in the nutrient flux from the mississippi river primarily owing to the type or nature of nutrient delivery for example the proportion of nitrate in the total nitrogen increased by 15 from the 1980s to recent years battaglin et al 2010 hypoxia has also been reported in the yangtze estuary and the east china sea mainly fuelled by the decomposition of both riverine and marine biogenic substances li et al 2002 chen et al 2007 wei et al 2021 algal blooms resulting from elevated inputs of nutrient fluxes from the yangtze river are an important source of organic matter and eventually result in hypoxia chen et al 2007 wang et al 2017 thus the remaining nutrients in coastal waters especially in the outer shelf were highly influenced by phytoplankton uptake as supported by a four cruise field investigation during 2002 2003 in the yangtze estuary and adjacent waters wang et al 2008 and the depletion of nitrate by biological production in the amazon shelf waters demaster and pope 1996 thus the nutrient outputs from large rivers play a very important role in marine ecology besides riverine output of nutrients for blooms offshore upwelling of sea water supplying favorable temperature and nutrients is also a very important dynamic factor influencing the occurrence of maritime red tides in the gulf of mexico the major red tide events are even largely determined by upwelling from coastal seas on the west florida shelf liu et al 2016 which also plays a key role in the advection and termination of major red tide events weisberg et al 2018 liu et al 2022a b similar processes were also detected in the yangtze estuary where the dinoflagellate bloom was partially affected by the upwelling of open sea waters zhou et al 2016 k veneficum bloom was also reported to occur in a well known upwelling zone the zhoushan fishery in the east china sea dai et al 2014 actually the zhejiang coastal waters is a most crucial area of the china seas characterized by red tides resulting from coastal upwelling particularly in terms of water temperature zhao et al 2003 lou et al 2012 this study is a preliminary work trying to find out the potential linkage between the maritime red tides and the riverine output of nutrient fluxes and is mainly focused on the latter to the ocean based on in situ measurements the deep mechanism of red tide blooms in the yangtze estuary and the east china sea still requires further detailed research in special 5 conclusions the yangtze river contributes most of the nutrients to the east china sea in this study consecutive monthly data for nutrients including tp and tn were collected over the past two decades at the xuliujing station in the upper yangtze estuary in the long term the changing process of the riverine nutrient flux during the past 70 years can be divided into three stages reflecting different levels of social development and changes in managing concepts this study determined the two decade variation in the nutrient fluxes from the yangtze river to the ocean at both seasonal and interannual scales and showed that it is controlled by seasonal riverine water discharge and fertilizer use in the catchment specifically the fluxes of tp and tn in the flood seasons were much larger than those in the dry seasons and the multiyear mean fluxes of tp and tn were 0 09 0 02 and 1 61 0 23 mt yr respectively based on a 20 year dataset the yangtze river s nutrient output is a vital nutrient source to the sea resulting in potential ecological issues such as red tides in the east china sea during the past 2 decades the annual frequency and area of red tides occurring in the east china sea averaged 38 19 red tides and 5120 4470 km2 respectively the major red tides single area 100 km2 averaging 73 9 in annual total area consisted of two periods as a first insignificant increase before 2005 and a subsequent significant decrease at the interannual scale and primarily occurred in late spring and early summer particularly in may 50 0 in frequency and 57 9 in area at the seasonal scale the intensity of the annual major red tides in may had a relatively decent reaction to the tp and tn fluxes but also reflected inconsistence suggesting some other influencing factors continuous monitoring of the yangtze river nutrient output and ecological interaction mechanisms between land and sea still need to be addressed in future studies credit authorship contribution

2398,riverine nutrient fluxes are of great implications for marine ecosystems however there is a lack of knowledge on the source to sink process of nutrient fluxes particularly the total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn in the yangtze river and its adjacent sea thus this study provides historic changes in riverine nutrient fluxes to the sea over the past 70 years and tries to figure out their response to catchment related factors and potential ecological influence on the sea during the past two decades it is found that the process of the nutrient flux to the sea over the past 70 years can be divided into three stages as a low level stage before 1980 a rapid developing stage after reform and opening up and a final stage under government regulation based on our detailed measurements in the recent two decades 2004 2020 the increasing trends of the riverine nutrient fluxes have slowed down and the tp and tn fluxes averaged 0 09 0 02 and 1 61 0 23 mt yr respectively 12 2 and 4 8 smaller than the previous five year 1999 2003 averages the seasonal characteristics of the nutrient fluxes primarily reflected the controlling effect of the yangtze river water discharge and the overall interannual characteristics of the nutrient fluxes were related to the fertilizer use in the catchment over the past two decades the annual frequency and area of red tides occurring in the east china sea averaged 38 red tides and 5120 km2 respectively the major red tides single area 100 km2 mainly occurred between march and september and peaked in may 50 0 and 57 9 of the total frequency and area respectively the intensity of red tides had a relatively decent reaction to the nutrient fluxes in may but also exhibited some uncertainties affected by some other important influencing factors this study supplies a more continuous accurate and detailed field measured dataset of tp and tn fluxes from the yangtze river to the ocean and assists in exploring the potential linkage between the maritime red tides and riverine nutrient fluxes keywords yangtze river total phosphorus total nitrogen fertilizer use red tides data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river material flux is an important linkage between the continents and oceans milliman and farnsworth 2011 human activities and climatic changes within catchments affect marine environments via river fluxes over the past decades numerous studies have examined the riverine water and sediment changes and their impacts on estuaries and deltas giosan et al 2014 yang et al 2018 2020 in comparison less is known about riverine nutrient fluxes in particular those based on systematic observation nitrogen n and phosphorus p are indispensable elements for the growth and reproduction of marine organisms thereby affecting the estuaries and coastal ecosystems among many nutrient sources to the sea the transport of fluvial materials is recognized as a vital pathway that delivers large amounts of nutrients and significantly influences the global biogeochemical cycling of elements in adjacent seas walsh 1991 seitzinger et al 2010 kim et al 2021 beusen et al 2022 for example the amazon river provides 25 of the total nitrogen tn to the north atlantic ocean howarth et al 1996 however due to the increasing intensified anthropogenic activities in basins riverine nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry changes may modify the structure of nutrients resulting in eutrophication and the subsequent degradation of estuarine ecosystems turner and rabalais 1994 ludwig et al 2009 wu et al 2019 in recent centuries increasing riverine n and p inputs to the ocean due to industrialization agricultural practices and wastewater have been reported to have dramatic consequences for ecosystems worldwide bouwman et al 2005 beusen et al 2016 maavara et al 2020a globally damming decoupled the global river fluxes of n and p and increased the n p ratios delivered to the coastal zone increasing the potential for p limitations on coastal productivity maavara et al 2020b in the mississippi river because of a consistent increase in the use of chemical fertilizer nitrate and phosphorus concentrations increased 3 4 times from 1950 to 2000 which may have contributed to coastal eutrophication and hypoxia justić et al 2002 rabalais and turner 2019 in addition fertilizer loss and sewage effluents mainly contributed to the nitrogen and phosphorus in the yellow river but dam construction and phytoplankton uptake significantly lowered nutrient concentrations wu et al 2021 therefore riverine nutrient concentrations and fluxes are seriously influenced by human activities and change coastal ecological environments so they need to be clearly addressed chinese rivers output approximately 5 10 of the total surface runoff to the global ocean and the yangtze changjiang river fig 1 is the largest river in terms of both water discharge 900 km3 yr and length 6300 km on the eurasian continent thus it plays a fundamental role in the continental inputs to chinese coastal zones gao and wang 2008 wu et al 2019 like other rivers globally the yangtze river is also undergoing many stressors from anthropogenic activities such as dam construction rapid population growth agricultural practices and urbanization fig 1c especially in the last two decades yang et al 2014 luo et al 2018 in the east china sea where the yangtze river empties frequent harmful algal blooms have become the most serious eco environmental problem and even once accounted for 89 of reported events in all chinese coastal areas in the early 20th century li et al 2014 liu et al 2018 2022a b thus the variation in and transport of nutrients from the yangtze river to the sea are long standing concerns that significantly affect coastal water ecosystems dai et al 2011 presented early remarkable upwards trends of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate during 1955 2008 from the yangtze river to the sea exhibiting the influence of the population increase and the use of large scale chemical fertilizers in the catchment fig 1c which could have caused an increased red tide bloom one type of harmful algal bloom and decreased dissolved oxygen in the changjiang estuary recently zhang et al 2021 also demonstrated increases in seaward nutrient fluxes in the yangtze river driven by human migration and land use changes however most existing studies of nutrient transport from the yangtze river have primarily focused on dissolved inorganic nutrients xu et al 2013 liang and xian 2018 ge et al 2020 but there has been little research on tn and total phosphorus tp both of them include inorganic and organic components support phytoplankton growth and have implications for algal blooms wang et al 2019 showed that the mean fluxes of tn and tp from the yangtze river were 1 69 million ton year mt yr and 0 11 mt yr respectively based on a 5 year dataset subsequently the exploration of whether the nutrient fluxes were affected by the three gorges reservoir tgr and the south to north water transfer project was conducted based on longer timescale data with high uncertainties established by a numerical model wang et al 2020 liu et al 2018 also explored the spatiotemporal changes in the yangtze river tn and tp flux exports to the east china sea but did not provide implications for the eco environment in the estuary and adjacent waters overall the yangtze river basin has experienced rapid ecological environment changes that are difficult to address particularly after 2000 when they greatly affected the marine environment of the east china sea li et al 2007 liu et al 2018 in addition environmental protection awareness in china has gradually increased strokal et al 2017 therefore to date it is still urgent for us to address the variations in the nutrients flowing from the yangtze river to the sea and the perspective of the human society ecological environment in the present study consecutive monthly data of the nutrients tn and tp and hydrological variables with high precision and temporal resolution for the past 20 years 2000 2020 were collected at the xuliujing station in the yangtze estuary fig 1 the key hydrological station nearest to the entrance of the east china sea we therefore aimed to reveal the historic changes in tn and tp fluxes from the yangtze river to the sea during the past 70 years in combination of published data and then estimate the driving factors in society and environment we also evaluated the potential role of riverine nutrients in the red tides in coastal marine ecosystems aiming to provide references for policy makers who are attempting to manage the estuarine environment 2 study area

1 the yangtze estuary in a broad sense refers to the reach from the datong station tidal limit to the subaqueous delta fig 1b downward of the xuliujing station fig 1b the estuary is separated into four outlets that makes the xuliujing station a key site monitoring the riverine outputs to the sea the east china sea fig 1a is a wide and relatively shallow marginal sea with an area of 77 104 km2

xuliujing station between 2000 and 2020 and there was a lack of tp and tn data between 2000 and 2003 the water samples were collected by a stainless steel sampler and detected according to the technical specifications requirements for monitoring of surface water and waste water by the ministry of environmental protection china the concentrations of do were determined using electrochemical probe methods with a general error of less than 1 hj 506 2009 the national environmental protection standard of the people s republic of china the ph of 0 5 l sample for tn test was adjusted to 2 with

spectrophotometric method with a detection limit of 0 01 mg l gb t 11893 89 the national standard of the people s republic of china wang et al 2020 the monthly nutrient flux to the sea was the product of the concentration and the corresponding monthly water discharge at datong station and the annual nutrient fluxes were the total amounts of all the months in a whole year for the measurements in this study the errors of annual nutrient fluxes were estimated as the products of the annual water discharge and the errors in the concentration detection for the annual tp and tn fluxes before 2003 reported by wang et al 2020 the errors were usually between 18 8 and 22 3 simplified as 20 according to the differences between the measured and simulated data data on population effective irrigation

centralized pollution control facilities the data of the main provinces that the yangtze river flows through fig 1 were accumulated to roughly represent the total amount of the yangtze river basin the

historic changes in the nutrient fluxes along with the social development a simulated multi year dataset 1950 2003 accurate to a year of the tp and tn fluxes by wang et al 2020 considering the population density gross domestic product rainfall cultivated area and agricultural water consumption etc was assembled with our detailed data in this study 2004 2020 accurate to a month to analyze the long term variation based on our own calculation the relative errors averaged 8 91 9 07 and 6 83 5 95 for tp and tn fluxes respectively according to the differences between our measured data and their simulated data during the same period from 2004 to 2016 fig s1 some extremely high values in the nutrient fluxes reflected the control of extreme summer floods such as the intra fluctuations in 1954 1983 1998 2016 and 2020 green dashed circles in fig 2 and were ignored in the following analysis the progresses of the nutrient fluxes can be divided into 3 stages as an initial stage 1950 1979 in low level development before 1980 a rapid developing stage 1980 2002 after the reform and opening up and a final stage 2003 2020 under government regulation of nutrient output in transition from increasing to steady or even recent decreasing states similar trends were also detected in the evolution process of the dissolved inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen fluxes zhang et al 2021 there were no evident trends in the initial stage for either the tp or tn fluxes p 0 05 fig 2 which averaged 6 82 0 92 104 t yr and 112 35 14 97 104 t yr respectively after the reform and opening up since the early 1980s the development of population urbanization industry and agriculture etc all accelerated in the basin fig 1c and both the tp 8 95 1 07 104 t yr and tn 148 36 17 56 104 t yr fluxes changed to significant increases p 0 01 fig 2 the mean fluxes of tp and tn increased from 8 78 0 69 104 t yr and 145 39 11 05 104 t yr of the first five years to 10 09 1 05 104 t yr and 168 28 15 45 104 t yr of the last five years respectively in the final stage of the recent two decades no particular trends were found in the interannual changes of the tp and tn fluxes p 0 05 fig 2 the mean averages of the tp and tn fluxes of the first five years 8 36 2 40 104 t yr and 149 13 17 53 104 t yr respectively after the tgr decreased by 17 1 and 11 4 compared with the last five year averages of before the tgr and the tp and tn fluxes in the dry season went up with a mean rate of 28 3 due to the regulation on seasonal re distribution of water discharge by the tgr wang et al 2020 4 2 changes in the nutrient fluxes and other variables during the past two decades 4 2 1 interannual trends for the past 20 years the tp and tn concentrations averaged 0 10 0 03 and 1 87 0 33 mg l respectively no particular trends were found in either the tp or tn concentrations fig 3 b1 c1 p 0 05 fig s2a1 b1 while the seasonal fluctuations within a year in both the tp and tn concentrations became much smaller during recent years fig 3b1 c1 based on detailed analysis the standard deviations of annual tp and tn concentrations averages of monthly values both exhibited significant decreasing trends over the past two decades p 0 01 p 0 05 fig s2a2 b2 the mean fluxes of tp and tn for the past 20 years were 0 75 0 42 104 ton month t mth and 13 38 6 40 104 t mth respectively and the latter was 18 times larger than the former some extreme values in the fluxes of tp and tn dashed green circles in fig 3b1 c1 were found to be related to extreme summer floods dashed green circles in fig 3a1 for example 2 24 104 t of tp in july 2010 and 36 58 104 t of tn in july 2016 the water discharge showed no evident interannual trend and averaged 884 117 km3 yr during the past 20 years fig 3a2 unlike the water discharge the annual sediment discharge showed a distinct decreasing trend with some fluctuations p 0 01 after 2003 when the tgr began operating fig 3a2 declining from 340 mt in 2000 to only 72 mt in 2011 table 1 no particular trend was found for the tp flux p 0 05 but a significant increasing trend was found for the tn flux p 0 01 at the interannual scale fig 3b2 c2 the annual fluxes of the tp and tn from the yangtze river to the sea averaged 0 09 0 02 mt yr and 1 61 0 23 mt yr respectively the multiyear averages of the tp and tn fluxes in this study were quite close to the values 0 11 and 1 69 mt yr respectively by wang et al 2019 based on a short 5 year dataset in addition our results are 1 7 and 1 1 times larger than the dissolved inorganic phosphorus 1 66 109 mol yr equal to 0 05 mt yr and nitrogen 108 109 mol yr equal to 1 51 mt yr respectively multiyear averages between 2004 and 2015 reported by zhang et al 2021 4 2 2 seasonal variations significant seasonal variation in the water discharge at datong station from the yangtze river to the ocean was detected during the past 20 years fig 3a1 averagely ranging from 357 86 108 m3 month m3 mth in february to 1307 293 108 m3 mth in july fig 4 a with the monthly maximum occurring in july 2020 at 1920 108 m3 due to the regulation of the water discharge between the flood and dry seasons by the large reservoirs for example the tgr and some cascade reservoirs in the upper yangtze river the five year averages of water discharge in january increased from 365 102 108 m3 for 2000 2004 to 464 82 108 m3 for 2016 2020 a total increase of 27 in january at the same time the water discharge in the flood seasons was often intensified by extreme summer floods such as 1639 108 m3 in july 2010 1766 108 m3 in july 2016 and 1922 108 m3 in july 2020 dashed green circles in fig 3a1 the sediment discharge from the yangtze river which is highly related to the water discharge showed the same seasonal characteristics figs 3a1 and 4a as high as 10 400 104 tons in july 2000 and as low as 90 104 tons in february 2017 do is an important indicator to judge the quality of water bodies such as rivers or estuaries the concentration of do at xuliujing station presented evident seasonal variation from 2000 to 2020 usually varying from 6 mg l in the flood seasons to 12 mg l in the dry seasons fig s3 although the concentrations of tp and tn lack of data before 2003 did not present evident seasonal variations the fluxes of tp and tn still showed evident seasonal characteristics figs 3b1 c1 and 4b c the seasonal variations in the nutrient fluxes mainly reflected the controlling effect of seasonal water discharges usually against relatively stable nutrient concentrations liu and shen 2001 zhang et al 2003 4 3 recent response of nutrient fluxes to anthropogenic activities the nutrient fluxes to the sea were highly correlated with the fertilizer use fig 1c in the basin because of government regulation during the past two decades the yangtze river basin hosts more than 40 of the nation s population and is one of the most important agricultural regions in china liu et al 2022a b the population and effective irrigation area of the provinces that the yangtze river flows through exhibited both significant increasing trends p 0 001 growing from 476 million in 2000 to 512 million in 2020 and from 18 9 million hectares in 2000 to 23 5 million hectares in 2020 respectively fig 5 a according to the method using the function findchangepts in matlab software to detect abrupt changes and partition data into different periods both the phosphate and nitrogen fertilizer used in these provinces synchronously consisted of three different periods that was the first period with significant increasing trends p 0 001 for both a second period with decreasing trends insignificant for phosphate fertilizer p 0 05 and significant for nitrogenous fertilizer p 0 01 and a last dramatic period with significant decreasing trends p 0 001 for both fig 5b c the second periods of phosphate and nitrogenous fertilizer started in different years which were 2013 and 2011 for phosphate and nitrogenous fertilizer respectively while the third periods of phosphate and nitrogenous fertilizer both started in 2016 fig 5b c the current level of fertilizer used in the drainage basin in 2020 was even much lower than that in 2000 fig 5b c despite the continuous increase in the population and effective irrigation area the fertilizer used in the provinces that the yangtze river flows through showed different evolving processes there have been sharp and continuous declines in agricultural fertilizer use in the drainage basin since 2016 fig 5b c similar n and p flux trends were also observed in the yellow river wu et al 2021 this phenomenon was consistent with a previous analysis and was probably related to the plan of zero growth in fertilizer by 2020 by the chinese ministry of agriculture ma et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 reflecting the chinese government regulation on nutrient pollution to the coastal waters wang et al 2021 to maintain the consistency comparability and reliability of the data only the measurements from 2004 to 2020 in this study were adopted in the analysis of the past two decades an overall increasing trend p 0 01 with fluctuations was found for the tn flux during the past two decades but not for tp flux p 0 05 fig 5b c in contrast to the second period of decreases in fertilizer the nutrient flux didn t show a decreasing response fig 5b c probably due to the large amount of accumulated fertilizer dissolved in the basin over years the fluctuations of riverine tp and tn fluxes to the ocean became larger during recent years and the decreases between 2016 and 2018 dashed blue arrows were probably related to the dramatic declines in agricultural fertilizer since 2016 fig 5b c the conversions of fertilizer and nutrients were synchronized with each other after 2018 the fluxes of tn and tp recovered a little bit fig 5b c and were possibly related to the extreme summer floods in 2020 the temporal changing processes of the fluxes were accompanied by fluctuations back and forth demonstrating that in addition to agricultural inputs the yangtze river s fluxes to the ocean were also highly influenced by other factors such as industrial contributions land use changes urbanization and sewage discharges fig 1c gao and wang 2008 deng et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 for example both the sewage induced tp and tn fluxes discharged from the yangtze basin had increased for decades before 2010 liu et al 2018 while they stopped increasing after 2011 fig s4 primarily attributed to the government dominated enhanced n management in aquatic systems wang et al 2021 and reduction in fertilizer use fig 5b c ma et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 during the past decade even so the sewage induced tp and tn fluxes discharged from the yangtze basin still stayed at a relatively high level with no significant temporal trends p 0 05 fig s4 and respectively averaged 13 43 3 23 104 t yr and 122 69 14 54 104 t yr for the past decade which might contribute much to the riverine nutrients to the sea in fact in addition to the yangtze river similar temporal trends in coastal eutrophication occurred in all of china s near shore area over several decades showing the response to significant upwards trends in n and p fluxes from rivers influenced by human activities wu et al 2021 4 4 potential linkage to the red tide in the east china sea with the large amount of and rapid increases in nutrients from the yangtze river nutrient composition and concentrations were modified in the coastal sea thereby increasing the frequency of harmful algal blooms such as red tides according to the bulletin of china marine disasters and a previous study he et al 2022 most of the red tides in the east china sea occur in coastal waters meanwhile based on xu et al 2012 when the yangtze s water sediment and nutrients come out from the estuary large portions of them were transported southward by the coastal current along the inner continental shelf of the east china sea which means that the coastal waters of the east china sea are affected by the yangtze s output therefore most red tides in the east china sea occur in coastal waters that are always affected by the yangtze river fresh water according to the data from the bulletin of china marine disasters the annual frequency of red tides occurring in the east china sea varied from 11 to 86 fig 6 a and averaged 38 19 over the past 20 years at the same time the annual area of red tides varied from 1100 km2 to 15 200 km2 fig 6a and averaged 5120 4470 km2 as expected the frequency and the area of red tides were positively correlated with each other r 0 757 based on correlation analysis there were no good correlations between the annual frequency of red tides and the annual fluxes of wd r 0 148 sd r 0 045 tp r 0 352 and tn r 0 339 a major red tide in this study was defined as a red tide with a single area larger than 100 km2 this was different from previous studies in that a major red tide was usually defined as a red tide with 1 million cells per liter of seawater mainly focusing on cell concentrations of harmful algae liu et al 2016 weisberg et al 2018 based on the statistical analysis the red tides in the east china sea were primarily the major red tides fig 6a considering that the ratio of the annual area of major red tides to the total annual area averaged 73 9 the area of major red tides red empty circles evolved in the same manner as the total red tides fig 6a which consisted of an insignificant increase before 2005 p 0 05 and a significant decrease after 2006 p 0 01 fig 6b according to the method using the function findchangepts in matlab software according to the temporal distribution of the major red tides with tp and tn during the past 20 years major red tides usually occurred periodically consistent with the peak values of tp and tn in annual late spring and early summer fig 6b c further analysis of the frequency and area of major red tides revealed that major red tides occurred between march and september and peaked in may fig 7 a based on our statistical analysis the frequency and area of red tides in may accounted for 50 0 and 57 9 of the total major red tides in the past 20 years respectively may when is important enough for red tides was a good indicator to help filter out or weaken the impacts from some other factors such as seasonal water discharge and temperature the intensity of the annual major red tides had a relatively decent reaction to the fluxes of tp and tn in may for example the nutrient fluxes and area of major red tides in may between 2015 and 2020 represented a certain consistency in the transitions between the peak and trough values fig 7b no major red tides occurred in may 2007 fig 7b probably owing to the extremely low tp flux in may the solid blue circle in fig 7b however there were also some inconsistent variations between the nutrient fluxes and area of major red tides in may being hard to explain such as the inconsistency between 2011 and 2014 fig 7b besides under comparable levels of tp and tn fluxes the total area of annual major red tides in may sharply decreased from thousands of square kilometers before 2010 to usually only hundreds of square kilometers after 2011 fig 7b this phenomenon was in consistence with the declining trends of seawater areas with eutrophic status and the frequency of harmful algal blooms in chinese coastal waters over the last decade primarily attributed to the enhanced n management to control n pollution in aquatic systems by the chinese government since 2010 wang et al 2021 these uncertainties reflected that riverine nutrient supply was a vital but not the only factor for red tides and there were some other important influencing factors in particular not all the red tides in the east china sea occurred in the area affected by the yangtze river fresh water as to the riverine nutrient flux to the ocean riverine sediment can also be a nutrient source that is desorbed from the suspended sediment during transport from the river to coastal zones dai et al 2011 besides changes in sediment fluxes can reflect some anthropogenic activities in the basin i e the tgr that affect nutrient loads to the estuary notably wang et al 2020 but additional measurements are needed as to the intensity of red tides in the east china sea it could also be influenced by many other factors such as ph water temperature illumination intensity water stratification mixing and coastal upwelling may et al 2003 lou et al 2012 huang et al 2021 he et al 2022 for example the decline in the suspended sediment concentration in the yangtze estuary and adjacent coastal waters improved water clarity strengthened illumination intensity and photosynthesis and thus increased the intensity of red tides may et al 2003 huang et al 2022 at the same time in the yangtze estuary deflected river plume extensions after mega estuarine constructions could also have redistributed the suspended sediment concentration and nutrients thereby changing the location of red tides he et al 2022 from the perspective of nutrient sources considering the restrictions on fertilizer use in the yangtze river basin there were no distinct increasing trends but decreasing trends to a certain extent of the tp and tn fluxes in may fig 7c1 d1 the tp and tn fluxes in may were primarily dominated by the water discharge with correlation coefficients r being 0 732 and 0 622 respectively fig 7c2 d2 particularly in recent years the fluxes of tp and tn even showed perfectly consistent phased variations with the water discharge fig 7c1 d1 therefore the current trend of the red tides in the east china sea in may playing a significant role in determining the trend for the whole year is highly influenced by the water discharge in may from the yangtze river in addition global climate change has increased the frequency of extreme events in the yangtze river basin such as severe floods and droughts which impacts the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles gradually and evidently and robust and in depth research in the future is warranted this is a preliminary estimation of the yangtze river s output of nutrients to the sea and it still contains several gaps the nutrient fluxes to the ocean in this study mainly reflected the yangtze river output upstream of the xuliujing station downstream of the xuliujing station the output of nutrient fluxes from coastal cities particularly from the mega city shanghai fig 1b to the estuary could also be a considerable amount based on zhang et al 2021 the nutrient fluxes from the delta could account for as much as 5 20 of the yangtze river s total output 4 5 comparison with other large global river systems large rivers play a vital role in transporting nutrients to the ocean milliman and farnsworth 2011 based on a snapshot of many sites in the upper mississippi missouri and ohio rivers the concentrations of tn and tp were 0 181 and 2 112 mg l 0 171 and 0 978 mg l and 0 053 and 1 152 mg l respectively hill et al 2011 which are on the same order of magnitude as the multiyear average of those in the yangtze river as 0 103 and 1 868 mg l in this study in addition the tn flux from the mississippi river basin to the gulf of mexico is 1 56 mt yr goolsby and battaglin 2010 stackpoole et al 2021 which is slightly smaller than that from the yangtze river 1 61 0 23 mt yr for the past 20 years in contrast the flux of tn from the amazon river to the north atlantic ocean is 3 3 mt yr howarth et al 1996 which is twice as large as that from the yangtze river however a recent study conducted between 2011 and 2013 revealed a sharp decrease in the tn flux to 1 96 mt yr drake et al 2021 which was still 22 larger than that of the yangtze river different from those in inshore waters that are controlled by riverine input the nutrient concentrations in offshore waters could be largely affected by atmospheric deposition in korean coastal waters kim et al 2013 in amazon shelf waters algal blooms are largely sustained by the nutrient fluxes from the shoreward movement of ocean water as well as riverine supply demaster and pope 1996 these other sources of nutrient fluxes could also contribute greatly to the ocean and increase the uncertainty in the occurrence of algal blooms sometimes even under the circumstance of a decline in the total nutrient flux a change in nutrient type could still lead to severe ecological issues in the gulf of mexico the algal production induced hypoxic zone which has attracted a great amount of attention goolsby 2000 liu et al 2010 increased between 1997 and 2007 against the decline in the nutrient flux from the mississippi river primarily owing to the type or nature of nutrient delivery for example the proportion of nitrate in the total nitrogen increased by 15 from the 1980s to recent years battaglin et al 2010 hypoxia has also been reported in the yangtze estuary and the east china sea mainly fuelled by the decomposition of both riverine and marine biogenic substances li et al 2002 chen et al 2007 wei et al 2021 algal blooms resulting from elevated inputs of nutrient fluxes from the yangtze river are an important source of organic matter and eventually result in hypoxia chen et al 2007 wang et al 2017 thus the remaining nutrients in coastal waters especially in the outer shelf were highly influenced by phytoplankton uptake as supported by a four cruise field investigation during 2002 2003 in the yangtze estuary and adjacent waters wang et al 2008 and the depletion of nitrate by biological production in the amazon shelf waters demaster and pope 1996 thus the nutrient outputs from large rivers play a very important role in marine ecology besides riverine output of nutrients for blooms offshore upwelling of sea water supplying favorable temperature and nutrients is also a very important dynamic factor influencing the occurrence of maritime red tides in the gulf of mexico the major red tide events are even largely determined by upwelling from coastal seas on the west florida shelf liu et al 2016 which also plays a key role in the advection and termination of major red tide events weisberg et al 2018 liu et al 2022a b similar processes were also detected in the yangtze estuary where the dinoflagellate bloom was partially affected by the upwelling of open sea waters zhou et al 2016 k veneficum bloom was also reported to occur in a well known upwelling zone the zhoushan fishery in the east china sea dai et al 2014 actually the zhejiang coastal waters is a most crucial area of the china seas characterized by red tides resulting from coastal upwelling particularly in terms of water temperature zhao et al 2003 lou et al 2012 this study is a preliminary work trying to find out the potential linkage between the maritime red tides and the riverine output of nutrient fluxes and is mainly focused on the latter to the ocean based on in situ measurements the deep mechanism of red tide blooms in the yangtze estuary and the east china sea still requires further detailed research in special 5 conclusions the yangtze river contributes most of the nutrients to the east china sea in this study consecutive monthly data for nutrients including tp and tn were collected over the past two decades at the xuliujing station in the upper yangtze estuary in the long term the changing process of the riverine nutrient flux during the past 70 years can be divided into three stages reflecting different levels of social development and changes in managing concepts this study determined the two decade variation in the nutrient fluxes from the yangtze river to the ocean at both seasonal and interannual scales and showed that it is controlled by seasonal riverine water discharge and fertilizer use in the catchment specifically the fluxes of tp and tn in the flood seasons were much larger than those in the dry seasons and the multiyear mean fluxes of tp and tn were 0 09 0 02 and 1 61 0 23 mt yr respectively based on a 20 year dataset the yangtze river s nutrient output is a vital nutrient source to the sea resulting in potential ecological issues such as red tides in the east china sea during the past 2 decades the annual frequency and area of red tides occurring in the east china sea averaged 38 19 red tides and 5120 4470 km2 respectively the major red tides single area 100 km2 averaging 73 9 in annual total area consisted of two periods as a first insignificant increase before 2005 and a subsequent significant decrease at the interannual scale and primarily occurred in late spring and early summer particularly in may 50 0 in frequency and 57 9 in area at the seasonal scale the intensity of the annual major red tides in may had a relatively decent reaction to the tp and tn fluxes but also reflected inconsistence suggesting some other influencing factors continuous monitoring of the yangtze river nutrient output and ecological interaction mechanisms between land and sea still need to be addressed in future studies credit authorship contribution

2399,accurate streamflow prediction plays an essential role in guaranteeing the sustainable utilization and management of water resources in recent years artificial intelligence ai models have been widely used for flow prediction the performance of these models depends on the appropriate calibration of the input features and model parameters theoretically the embedded feature selection method directly takes the final prediction model as a prediction indicator which has the unique advantage of parallel optimization of feature and prediction model parameters compared with other methods despite being widely used in many other fields its streamflow forecasting abilities are thus far unknown in this paper an embedded prediction model efs svmigwo with improved gray wolf optimizer igwo and support vector machine svm is proposed based on the principle of embedded feature selection method and validated with monthly runoff prediction at kizil reservoir station in xinjiang china the validation results demonstrate that the efs svmigwo model has consistently better accuracy and stable values than the benchmark methods including autoregressive integrated moving average random forest neural network and svm models based on filtered selection methods moreover igwo is compared to differential evolution de particle swarm optimization pso whale optimization algorithm woa sparrow search algorithm ssa and gray wolf optimizer gwo and the results show that igwo has better convergence speed and solution quality in feature and model parameter parallel optimization tasks overall research and analysis indicate that the efs svmigwo model can exhibit convincing performance in monthly streamflow forecasting thus it is of great importance to carefully choose the input variables and parameters to develop more effective models for forecasting monthly streamflow time series keywords hydrologic time series improved gray wolf algorithm streamflow prediction support vector machine feature selection data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction streamflow is the basic and critical component of global and regional hydrological cycles accurate and robust streamflow prediction is considered one of the most stable and practical technical measures to support the scientific management and operation of water resource systems niu and feng 2021 however streamflow is typically affected by numerous factors such as solar radiation underlying surfaces and atmospheric circulation exhibiting complex nonlinearity high uncertainty and randomness phenomena rezaie balf et al 2019 deb et al 2019 the development of powerful methods with high levels of reliability to achieve accurate forecasting remains a major challenge rezaie balf et al 2019 to date a large variety of streamflow prediction models have been proposed mainly classified as process driven models and data driven models process driven models represent the physical process under hydrological variables by governing mathematical equations which are good at providing insight into catchment processes while these methods typically require a large amount of calibration data and some degree of expertise and experience with the models which limits practical applications prasad et al 2017 compared to physical models data driven models use past observations to mine and extend time varying relationships within time series and are widely used in practice due to their simplicity of design and implementation and relative accuracy in prediction problems meng et al 2021 yaseen et al 2016 data driven models can be further classified into time series models and artificial intelligence ai models time series models such as autoregressive integrated moving average arima and multiple linear regression mlr liu et al 2012 büyükşahin and ertekin 2019 their applications are limited by assumptions of normality linearity and variable independence he et al 2020 compared with time series models ai models have the advantages of self organization and adaptive learning and can better handle noisy data in nonlinear dynamic systems liu and chen 2019 the widely used ai models include artificial neural network ann yang et al 2017 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis zhou et al 2019 extreme learning machine elm generalized regression neural network grnn diop et al 2018 random forest rf and support vector machine svm a few studies have investigated the performance of the above ai models in earth science fields for example the performances of mlr ann elm and svm in deriving operation rule of hydropower reservoir are compared in ref niu et al 2019 the performances of ann elm anfis and svm in forecasting daily streamflow are compared in ref niu and feng 2021 the performances of ann elm and svm in forecasting monthly runoff are compared in ref feng et al 2020 the existing research reports have fully demonstrated the superiority of the svm over ann elm and anfis a review of the application of svm in the field of hydrology can be found in ref raghavendra and deka 2014 streamflow series comprise of periods trends and noise components and the process of the streamflow is complicated these pure ai models cannot always adequately capture the characteristics of hydrological series due to inherent disadvantages such as a lack of theoretical standards for determining parameters and insufficient robustness to noise zhao et al 2021 meng et al 2021 in general it has been proved that identifying the optimal parameter combination is a vital step in the successfulness of the forecasting models adnan et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 metaheuristic approaches such as differential evolution de particle swarm optimization pso sparrow search algorithm ssa and the whale optimization algorithm woa have been widely used in the last two decades and are more efficient in dealing with the optimization process zhang et al 2021 in contrast to the exhaustive search brute force search and random search mechanisms metaheuristics can be considered as directed random algorithms and may determine a near optimal solution from an exponential set of feasible solutions in a reasonable time shekhawat et al 2021 the gray wolf optimizer gwo is a successful metaheuristic that mimics the hunting behavior and the social leadership hierarchy of gray wolves in nature nadimi shahraki et al 2021 compared to other similar techniques the gwo algorithm has very few parameters to tune and benefits from several adaptive mechanisms to deal with search landscapes of different shapes clustering classification regression and other function optimization tasks emary et al 2016 faris et al 2019 since the gwo algorithm was introduced by mirjalili et al in 2014 its application has not ceased and the first published gwo article has been cited 5600 times in a short time span however similar to other metaheuristic algorithms the standard gwo easily falls into local minima many scholars have tried to improve the gwo algorithm which has enhanced the optimization capability of the algorithm to different degrees on the other hand feature selection fs approaches are a major way to improve the performance of single models since they provide essential information about the designed system feature selection can be defined as the process of identifying and eliminating features that are irrelevant or harmful to pattern extraction in order to obtain better faster and more comprehensible solutions for machine learning tasks according to the style of evaluating fs techniques can be categorized into model free approaches filter methods and model based approaches including wrapper and embedded methods this is shown in fig 1 model free approaches are usually known as filter based feature selection ffs methods since they select the set of features independently from the learning algorithm rezaie balf et al 2019 generally ffs executes a statistical measure e g distance dependency consistency or information between the input variables and the target variables to allocate a score to each feature then all the features are further ranked by these scores to select relevant features zhu et al 2017 ren et al 2020 the linear pearson correlation partial correlation function pacf random forests rf and mutual information mi are popular measurements used in filter methods zarshenas and suzuki 2016 ren et al 2020 although ffs is faster than other correlation methods these methods are generally linear correlation ranking methods and they usually treat each candidate variable separately which ignores the relationship between various features quilty et al 2016 another drawback is that these methods cannot work with redundant information zhang et al 2021 the model based approaches generate different subsets of features using some search strategy and evaluate the performance of selected feature subsets with the aid of a machine learning algorithm clustering classification or regression during the search for the optimal subset which are generally divided into wrapper feature selection methods and embedded feature selection efs the focus of this paper the difference between these two classes lies in the fact that the efs select the optimal features during the prediction model calibration phase which integrate feature selection and the prediction model tuning into a single process while the wrapper methods treat the prediction model as a pure black box and the feature selection model used in these is independent of the prediction model pashaei and aydin 2017 searching for the optimal feature subset among an unabridged dataset is a challenging task due to two main issues aljarah et al 2018 the first is the complexity of the interaction between features al tashi et al 2020 the second is the huge search space the possible total number of solutions for an m dimensional feature set is as large as 2m which determines that feature selection is an np hard problem faris et al 2018 in hydrological simulation existing feature selection methods include filter techniques liu et al 2014 he et al 2020 luo et al 2019 trial and error approach based on filter techniques or hydrological expertise sudheer et al 2013 mehdizadeh and sales 2018 tan et al 2018 niu and feng 2021 yaseen et al 2016 karimi et al 2018 he et al 2014 and wrapper methods alizadeh et al 2020 in general existing prediction models are time consuming and not accurate enough while some filtering approaches may be useful for reducing the number of inputs included in the set of candidates it fails to capture the typical interdependencies redundancies and nonlinearities in hydrologic systems snieder et al 2020 in the field of machine learning there is a large body of literature developing fs extraction method based on heuristic algorithms to solve clustering and classification problems however pertinent issues of variable selection have not been adequately addressed in the field of hydrologic prediction and the feature selection consistently receives little attention prasad et al 2017 taormina and chau 2015 the original intention of the efs technique is to realize the synchronous optimization of features and model parameters in the process of model calibration unlike common feature selection methods filter techniques and wrapper methods this method automatically determines the optimal feature vector based on the simulation results of the final prediction model compared with common methods the efs are more accurate and robust as they focus on development of the final prediction model and can take different data properties into account e g manifold structure data distribution priors and data reconstruction zhu et al 2017 theoretically efs have obvious advantages over wrapper and other feature selection methods in feature selection despite these advantages to the best of the authors knowledge the potential has never been explored in the existing hydrological prediction literature however efs methods are computationally more expensive and their performance strongly depends on a calibrated model ai model pashaei and aydin 2017 despite the important contribution of metaheuristics in the field of feature selection in most cases the best solution is not obtained because the optimization problem of the ai model involved in feature selection is ignored segera et al 2020 determining the best architecture of ai models is vital for increasing the accuracy of prediction by the model and also to reduce run time molajou et al 2021 it is worth noting that for neural network based ai models ann mlr and anfis etc their structural design is a difficult task including the number of hidden layers the number of hidden node neurons and adjustment of different factors e g epoch number and connection weights their number varies with the variables of the input model and the number is generally higher than 15 tikhamarine et al 2020 abbasi et al 2021 niu and feng 2021 if the above ai model is chosen as the base prediction model for efs this further increases the computational difficulty of efs in comparison svm model has less control parameters only 3 hyperparameters need to be optimized and stronger nonlinear mapping ability meng et al 2021 which is a significant advantage in building efs models in order to rectify the problem of feature selection in hydrological prediction modeling this paper integrates the advantages of the svm and igwo methods proposes a runoff feature extraction and prediction method based on embedded methods and investigates its potential for accurate monthly stream forecasting in a semiarid region the major contribution of this work can be summarized as follows 1 different from traditional runoff forecasting models a novel one based on embedded feature extraction method is proposed the model uses svm as the base prediction model and integrates the svm hyperparameter optimization task and feature selection problem in the metaheuristic search process to achieve automatic calibration of the model 2 to solve the embedded prediction problem a metaheuristic algorithm coding method with mixed binary and real number encoding is introduced in addition an improved gray wolf algorithm igwo using a tent chaotic mapping initialization population and a nonlinear convergence factor strategy is proposed 3 the predictive power of the proposed model efs svmigwo is verified against conventional prediction models arima rf that do not require the determination of feature vectors and prediction models e g ann svm etc based on filtered feature selection methods pacf and rf the search capability of the igwo algorithm for embedded modeling optimization tasks is also verified with state of the art metaheuristics gwo ssa woa pso and de 4 experimental results demonstrate that the proposed efs svmigwo method provide more precise and stable forecasting results compared to the benchmark models the igwo achieves promising performance when compared with the state of art metaheuristics in the recent literature the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows section 2 provides a detailed introduction to the methodologies including a description of the necessary basic theory the proposed svm based embedded methods and performance evaluation criteria section 3 describes the catchment properties of the study area and model development the principal results and relevant discussion are detailed in section 4 finally conclusions are highlighted in the last section of the paper 2 methodology 2 1 basic concepts regression models seek to quantify relationships existing between a process response variable and a set of potential drivers features or explanatory variables that may contain relevant irrelevant redundant and or noisy information quilty et al 2016 the negative information used as part of the training procedure is likely to worsen the model s underlying complexity and trigger poor generalization performance prasad et al 2017 salcedo sanz et al 2014 in general fs aims to select the optimal feature vector feature subset among the original set of features by eliminating the redundant and or irrelevant features taradeh et al 2019 alizadeh et al 2020 the feature input variable selection task can be addressed in the following way for n pairs of samples d x i y i i 1 n where x i r q y i r k q is the total available features k is the forecast lead time and we choose a subset of m features m q that achieves the lowest error in the prediction of y i salcedo sanz et al 2014 forecasting river flow using memory i e the time lag of stream flow is an effective method of prediction in hydrology if qt is the streamflow to be forecasted antecedent streamflows qt 1 qt 2 qt q are selected as alternative factors where qt q denotes the q antecedent variables of the forecast month luo et al 2019 as shown in fig 2 the past observations that are significantly correlated with the response variables are taken as the best feature vector fv the best sample set is extracted according to fv and further divided into training samples and testing samples fang et al 2019 2 2 support vector machine svm the support vector machine svm algorithm was introduced by vapnik vapnik 1995 on the basis of statistical learning theory the basic principle of svm for regression is to map the data into a high dimensional feature space via nonlinear mapping ϕ in which the nonlinear separable problem becomes linearly separable in space therefore linear regression is performed in that feature space wang and hu 2015 fig 3 shows a sketch map of the svm model niu and feng 2021 the regression formula is defined as 1 f x i w i ϕ x i b where w i is an adjustable weight vector and b stands for the scalar threshold also known as bias b r the error between response variables y i and fitting values f x i is evaluated using the following ε insensitive loss function l ε 2 l ε f x i y i f x i y i ε f x i y i ε 0 f x i y i ε where ε is related to smoothening the complexity of the approximation function which means that errors less than ε will be ignored fig 4 describes the loss function formulation using l ε one can find f x that can better approximate the response variables y and has the at most error tolerance ε from the actual incurred targets y i for all training data and concurrently as flat as possible w and b can be obtained from the data by optimizing the following convex optimization problem huang et al 2014 3 min g w b ξ i ξ i 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i s t y i w ϕ x i b ε ξ i w ϕ x i b y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 i 1 2 n where ξ i and ξ i are slack variables introduced to measure the deviation of training samples outside the ε insensitive zone fig 4 the former part of objective function 1 2 w 2 represents the generalization ability of the regression function while the latter part stands for the empirical risk based on the ε insensitive loss function the parameter c is a weight penalty constant that adjusts the weight between the two components by controlling the extent of samples exceeding ε ji et al 2014 the above svm optimization problem is usually solved in its dual form using lagrange multipliers and the regression function for the svm model can be expressed as follows niu and feng 2021 feng et al 2020 4 f x i 1 n a i a i k x x i b where k x i x represents the kernel function satisfying mercer s condition in the literature many studies have shown that the radial basis function rbf has better performance in handling high dimensional complex samples and is easy to implement with fewer parameters compared to gaussian kernel functions and polynomial kernel functions meng et al 2021 here the rbf is chosen as the kernel function k x y exp x y 2 2 σ 2 σ is the width of the rbf kernel in this study svr models were implemented using matlab software and libsvm version 3 23 developed by chang and lin 2011 2 3 metaheuristic approaches 2 3 1 standard gwo algorithm generally the gwo algorithm considers three leader wolves named alpha α beta β and delta δ as the best solutions to lead the rest of the wolves candidate solutions named omega ω toward promising areas to find the global solution nadimi shahraki et al 2021 the gray wolves complete their predation following three steps encircling hunting and attacking this process is repeated until the fittest solution is obtained mirjalili et al 2014 guo et al 2021 1 encircling the prey considering x as the wolf position and xp as the prey position dp is the distance between the prey and a given wolf the new position of each wolf while encircling the prey can be determined as 5 x t 1 x p t a t d p d p c t x p t x t where t is the current iteration and a t and c t are coefficient vectors calculated by eq 6 6 a t 2 a t r 1 a t c t 2 r 2 a t 2 2 t t where r 1 and r 2 are random numbers r 1 r 2 0 1 and a are transition parameters that linearly decrease from 2 to 0 over the course of iterations and t is the maximum number of iterations of the algorithm 2 hunting the prey fig 5 presents how the search wolves change their location with respect to α β and δ in the search space tikhamarine et al 2020 alamiedy et al 2020 to simulate the prey it is assumed that the wolves of α β and δ have better knowledge about the location of the prey nadimi shahraki et al 2021 accordingly α β and δ define the location of the prey and the other wolves renew their locations randomly around the prey by using the following equations 7 x t 1 x 1 x 2 x 3 3 8 x 1 x α t a 1 t d α t d α t c 1 t x α t x t x 2 x β t a 2 t d β t d β t c 2 t x β t x t x 3 x δ t a 3 t d δ t d δ t c 3 t x δ t x t where x α t x β t and x δ t correspond to the α β and δ wolves and they are the first three best wolves solutions at iteration t a 1 a 2 a 3 c 1 c 2 and c 3 can be calculated by eq 6 3 searching and attacking the prey parameter a is used to determine a which leads the wolves toward the prey in a linear decrement manner from the original literature on gwo a 1 and or c 1 indicates that the wolves diverge from the current prey to achieve a global search exploration phase while a 1 and or c 1 indicates that the wolves are forced to attack the prey exploitation phase guo et al 2021 a detailed flowchart of the gwo algorithm is shown in fig 7 c first the algorithm generates an initial population of wolves within the search space by eq 9 the location of the wolf is evaluated by calculating the fitness then the following steps are repeated until the stopping criterion is satisfied the stopping criterion is to reach the predefined number of iterations more detailed information about the gwo algorithm can be found in mirjalili et al 2014 9 x ij l j r a n d j 0 1 u j l j where xij is the position of the ith wolf in the jth dimension n is the number of wolves in the population and d is the dimension number of the problem i 1 n j 1 d 2 3 2 improved gray wolf optimizer igwo effective balancing between the exploitation local search and exploration global search in a metaheuristic plays a crucial role in achieving excellent performance of an algorithm nadimi shahraki et al 2021 gwo is good at exploitation but inefficient at exploration and it is not sufficient for obtaining a feasible solution segera et al 2020 in the standard gwo a wolf search depends on the leading wolves and once the initial population selection is not appropriate gwo will face the risk of falling into the global optimum additionally in the standard gwo the algorithm begins with the exploration process as the transition parameter a is linearly decreased from 2 to 0 over the iterations eq 6 the algorithm moves gradually from emphasizing the exploration process to exploitation however the search process of the gwo algorithm is both nonlinear and complicated when the leading wolves become trapped at one local optimum it is difficult for the group to escape from it according to this search mechanism guo et al 2021 to overcome these issues in this section an improved gray wolf optimizer igwo is proposed nadimi shahraki et al 2021 the modified gwo fortifies against these issues using two strategies 1 initialize populations using tent chaos mapping chaotic mapping has the characteristics of ergodicity and randomness which can improve the diversity of populations and explore the search space more comprehensively within a certain range the way to improve the initialized population using tent mapping is shown in eq 10 and 11 10 x ij l j α j u j l j 11 α j ran d j 0 1 b 0 r a n d j 0 1 b 1 r a n d j 0 1 1 b b r a n d j 0 1 1 where b is the control parameter and b 0 5 is the typical form of tent mapping which corresponds to a more uniform population distribution 2 improved encircling mechanism a nonlinear convergence factor strategy is used to replace this linear decrement as follows guo et al 2021 12 a t 2 2 t t 2 the graphical representation of a is shown in fig 6 which shows that a decreases at a lower gradient in the initial phase and it is clear that the exploration phase of igwo grows from 50 to 70 iterations when the maximum number of iterations is 100 compared to the standard gwo this improved strategy compels the wolves to diverge from the leading wolves with this search strategy even if a gray wolf is going to a worse place than it is now it still must arrive which makes gwo more flexible and reinforces the global search ability thus avoiding premature convergence additionally the decline in acceleration at the later stage contributes to fast convergence guo et al 2021 2 4 embedded feature selection techniques 2 4 1 sketch of the methodologies in general three key elements must be specified when utilizing an embedded method predictor evaluation criteria of the feature subset and search algorithm to find the best combination of features al tashi et al 2019 in this paper an embedded feature selection efs prediction method that uses igwo as a search algorithm and svm as a predictor was proposed this efs svmigwo is centered on parallel optimization of feature selection and parameters using candidate features predefined by partial autocorrelation function pacf values the complete system architecture of efs svmgwo can be seen in fig 7 and the key steps of the proposed model can be described as follows step 1 original training set transformation 1 historical runoff data are divided into training and test series in chronological order 2 the pacf values are estimated for the runoff data on the training series and the number of continuous time series lagged data values maximum time lag is determined based on the correlation coefficients at each lag time 3 based on the maximum time lag the original training matrix is extracted from the training series step 2 training model 1 efs svmigwo uses igwo to generate a series of solutions i e a combination of parameters and feature vectors and each solution is used to train the svm predictor using a 10 fold cv strategy to obtain the corresponding fitness value 2 this process is cycled several times and the optimal solution is finally obtained by solving comparing and updating the solution for each cycle 3 once the best solution is obtained the training and test sets are reextracted based on the best feature vector and the optimized svm prediction model is recalibrated on the training set using the best parameters step 3 obtain final forecasts after the training stage the final svm prediction model is tested on the independent test set analyze the error and compare the prediction accuracy 2 4 2 gray wolf position encoding 1 individual encoding in the feature optimization process applying the predictor svm with optimized parameters is a necessary prerequisite for objective evaluation of feature subsets and thus efs is a hybrid optimization problem to formulate the efs prediction method as an optimization problem two key points should be carefully considered the first is the representation of the problem which comprises the encoding of the individuals in the algorithm and the representation of the population how to represent a solution the second point is the selection of a suitable fitness function to evaluate the quality of the individuals considering them as candidate solutions to the targeted problem how to evaluate a solution faris et al 2019 the solution in efs svmigwo is represented as a one dimensional vector with hybrid encoding as shown in fig 8 and consists of two main parts the svm parameter part and the feature selection mask feature vector part the first part parameters consists of 3 bits which indicate a combination of hyperparameters of the svm within a continuous space the second part feature selection masks is represented with binary strings of the total number of original features each mask is responsible for the existence of its corresponding feature to illustrate the feature at a certain location that is selected or not value 1 denotes that the corresponding attribute is selected whereas 0 means discarded feature selection is a binary optimization problem where solutions are restricted to the binary 0 1 values zarshenas and suzuki 2016 however the gwo algorithm was originally designed to solve optimization problems in continuous space and hence cannot be utilized directly to solve feature selection problems al tashi et al 2020 one of the popular methods to convert a continuous optimizer to suit binary problems is to use transfer functions tf mirjalili and lewis 2013 the purpose of tf is to define a probability of updating an element in the feature subset solution to be 1 selected or 0 not selected aljarah et al 2018 to squash the continuous solutions in each dimension of the feature encoding an s shaped transfer function is chosen in this study as the follows zhang et al 2017 13 p v i 1 e x i t 1 where x indicates the continuous position of the search agent and x i t indicates the i th dimension in the x solution depending on the produced probability pv from eq 13 the binary value is updated using eq 14 14 x i t 0 p v i 0 5 1 p v i 0 5 2 population encoding a population in igwo is a set of individuals who are updated over the course of iterations the population has a predefined fixed number of individuals each of which forms a candidate solution for our problem the population is defined as a matrix p of a size of n q 3 as shown in eq 15 where n is the number of individuals in the population each row in the matrix represents an individual according to the results of adnan et al 2021 the population and the number of iterations were set to 25 and 100 respectively 15 p c 1 σ 1 ε 1 f 11 f 12

structures and the selection of the optimal structure depends on the objective function chosen to assess the svm accuracy in the literature many studies have shown that the prediction accuracy of a model cannot be examined well using a single statistical indicator zhou et al 2019 however the existing studies commonly use a single statistical metric e g mean square error as the optimization objective which is usually biased in this study the combined value of normalized root mean square error nrmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and mean absolute percentage error mape was chosen as the optimization objective of the igwo algorithm considering both the accuracy and stability of the prediction results as depicted in eq 16 during the training stage a 10 fold cross validation cv scheme was used to evaluate the combination of parameters and feature vectors to eliminate possible bias prevent overfitting in selecting the test and training sets a detailed flowchart of the 10 fold cv is shown in fig 7 b the arithmetic mean accuracy of 10 validations was used as the fitness value see eq 17 and the final combination with the minimum fitness is considered to be the optimal combination

that in this framework different types of forecasting biases are standardized benefiting the model performance assessment across different watersheds 1 accuracy of prediction results 1 rmse

when the squared difference between the observed and predicted values is much larger than the variance of the observed values the nrmse approaches zero and the model is perfect when nrmse 1 the model prediction is equal to the average of all observations when nrmse 1 the prediction results of the model are not credible when nrmse 0 70 the fit is satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 18 nrmse rmse stdev

basin is formed by the confluence of five tributaries originating from the southern slopes of the tianshan mountains in xinjiang china each of which flows separately and converges at the kizil reservoir in the baicheng basin before disappearing near the northern bank of the tarim river a brief introduction of the study area illustrated in fig 9 is made as follows the ogan river basin is located between 41 06 42 50 n latitude and 80 53 82 52 e longitude the basin terrain is high in the north and low in the south with an elevation decreasing from 6231 m to 1022 m and the landform type is complex and variable in this region the catchment area of the basin is 1 7 104 km2 the total length of the main stream is 452 km and the length of the river below kizil reservoir is 170 km the ogan river basin is a typical arid inland river basin and the climate is characterized by infrequent rain strong evaporation large diurnal temperature differences adequate sunshine and dry air the mean annual temperature evaporation and precipitation in the basin are 8 1 1 964 4 mm and 115 6 mm respectively and evaporation from may to august accounts for 60 9 of the annual evaporation runoff in the basin mainly consists of glacial meltwater snowmelt runoff and rainfall runoff and the precipitation from june to august accounts for about 45 8 of the annual precipitation kizil reservoir is a large basin controlled water conservancy project built in xinjiang with a design capacity of 6 4 108 m3 it is mainly used for irrigation and water regulation and also has comprehensive benefits such as flood control and power generation over the past half century the management and sustainability of water resources in the ogan river basin have experienced a negative deterioration due to climate change and large scale water and soil development this has brought to the fore a series of ecological and environmental problems such as river disconnection declining groundwater levels natural vegetation degradation and land desertification in the basin one month ahead forecasting for streamflow at kizil reservoir is crucial for water resource decision making to ensure the proper management of water in regard to different water use types therefore robust monthly runoff prediction in this region plays a vital role in supporting sustainable economic and social development the historical monthly runoff records from january 1961 to december 2018 696 records at the kizil reservoir were used to evaluate the proposed model and the other state of the art models the records were collected from the ogan river basin authority the monthly runoff records were computed from the instantaneous values in m3 s observed at 08 00 each day to partition the data into the model development training and model evaluation testing parts the runoff series was separated into the training portion and test portion following the 75 and 25 division principle this is consistent with the suggestion of nelson and illingworth 1990 who supported the idea of 20 30 of data for testing nelson and illingworth 1991 stojković et al 2017 in addition this scene was adopted in previous studies rezaie balf et al 2017 hadi et al 2020 adnan et al 2021 3 2 characterization of the data table 1 summarizes the statistical properties of the monthly streamflow data including training testing and the complete data span the variations in streamflow at kizil reservoir are presented in fig 10 which shows that the streamflow of the reservoir varies within a relatively wide range and exhibits strong monthly periodicity and interannual variability fig 10 c shows that the basin runoff precipitation and average temperature show a fluctuating upward trend during the period 1961 2018 in the past 30 years the basin has experienced frequent extreme hydrological events e g superstandard floods in 1999 2002 2010 and 2016 table 1 shows that the sample entropy of the training data 0 48 is lower than that of the test data 0 61 indicating that there is more random noise component in the test set than in the training set and fig 10 b also shows a significant difference in the distribution of the training and test data the significant covariate bias between the two data sets can be speculated that the established prediction model may have difficulties in extrapolation the model cannot estimate data outside the training range 3 3 candidate feature identification streamflow with a 1 month lag usually has a relatively similar value to the current flow the high correlation between the runoff with 11 and 12 month lags and the current flow reflects the annual streamflow variation while flows with a shorter lag such as 6 7 and 8 months imply seasonal fluctuations as well as long term changes from atmospheric circulation luo et al 2019 fig 11 shows the acf and pacf values of the kizil reservoir training series with lags of 0 80 which indicates that the runoff series has a period of 12 months and the acf values peak at a lag of 12 months therefore runoff with a lag of 12 months q t 12 q t 11 q t 1 was selected as a candidate feature tikhamarine et al 2020 luo et al 2019 3 4 benchmark model design to verify the advantages of the embedded based methods modeling and comparative analysis with benchmark methods such as models that do not require the determination of feature vectors arima rf and a series of prediction models based on filtered feature selection methods e g svm and ann were carried out in the study in the experiments only one step ahead forecasting is considered and the detailed calibration process for each type of model is described below 3 4 1 arima model the model is also commonly referred to as arima p d q where p is the number of autoregressive terms q is the number of moving average terms and d stands for the difference of order fig 11 indicates that the monthly streamflow is not a pure ar or ma process but the arma model akaike s information criterion aic was used to select the optimal the ar p and ma q shibata 1976 more details about arima can be found in the literature wang et al 2015 the structure of the optimal model in this study was arima 12 0 11 3 4 2 random forest model random forest rf is one of the most widely used ensemble tree methods which generate a collection of de correlated decision trees and aggregate their results on the one hand rf has been applied to classification and regression problems which have the advantage of not requiring a predetermined feature vector li et al 2020 on the other hand sensitivity valuations within random forests rf are used to measure the importance of variables which has proved to be efficient for feature selection in different application domains masmoudi et al 2020 the parameters of the rf were set as ntree 500 and mtry 4 masmoudi et al 2020 lahouar and slama 2017 abbasi et al 2021 3 4 3 filter based methods 1 input variable combinations determination the feature sensitivity of rf is estimated by the prediction accuracy for the so called out of bag oob samples i e training data not in bootstrap samples more details about rf can be found in the literature masmoudi et al 2020 li et al 2020 pacf and random forest rf are used to compute the importance of the kizil reservoir training series from lag 1 to lag 12 and the results are shown in table 2 the antecedent streamflow with a greater correlation is included in the input variables for the forecasting model luo et al 2019 various input combinations are listed in table 3 in the ai model each input combination corresponds to one model framework and the ai model architecture that performed the best in the training period was determined to be the optimal model by the trial and error method 2 model parameter setting specifically the generalization ability of the svm model relies heavily on the hyperparameters c ε and σ while the performance of the ann also depends on the correct choice of the weights and biases for neurons i e the network parameters fang et al 2019 the correct selection of parameters can be considered an optimization problem and requires a high optimization algorithm to resolve this problem therefore gwo is used to determine the values of the computational parameters in addition the hidden node numbers and activation function are the two basic hyperparameters of the ann model in this study hidden node numbers were decided using the eq 24 which was adopted in the literatures tikhamarine et al 2020 aljarah et al 2019 faris et al 2016 the levenberg marquardt algorithm was employed to adjust the weights and biases for neurons i e the network parameters tan et al 2018 niu and feng 2021 24 j 2 i 1 table 4 gives the major parameters of the ann ann gwo svm svm gwo and svmigwo models more details of the above modeling process can be found at tikhamarine et al 2020 4 forecast results and discussions 4 1 prediction results of the benchmark models 1 prediction results of filter based methods the filter based forecasting models with different input combinations were compared based on their performance for both the simulation training and forecasting testing phases the detailed statistical indices of the results are listed in table 5 and the bolded values indicate the best statistics for each model table 5 shows that the first input m1 of each model had the highest value of the mape nrmse and ca as well as the lowest value of nse and qr in the testing period so the first input has the worst performance among all inputs the corresponding models are ann m1 anngwo m1 svmgs m1 svmgwo m1 and svmigwo m1 for ann anngwo and svmgs methods the 6th input had the lowest value of ca the combined value of nrmse mape and nse while the 2ed input had the highest value of qr in the test stage the prediction results show that the ca and qr values of the 6th input are reduced by ann 20 11 and 4 29 anngwo 8 88 and 3 55 and svmgs 11 57 and 2 61 respectively compared with those of the 2ed input although the qr value of the 6th input is decreased the change range of the ca values is more obvious than that of the qr values so the 6th input was selected as the best fit model for predicting the river flow in this study the corresponding models are ann m6 anngwo m6 and svmgs m6 similarly in svmgwo and svmigwo methods the prediction results of the 3rd and 6th inputs are more advantageous than the other inputs the ca and qr values of the 6th input are increased by svmgwo 3 97 and 4 76 and svmigwo 0 73 and 2 94 compared with those of the 3rd input the 3rd input was chosen as the best fit model and they correspond to the models are svmgwo m3 and svmigwo m3 the above results show that a high number of variable inputs does not guarantee better forecasting accuracy because the added input variables may contain harmful information such as redundancy and noise which deteriorate the model accuracy in forecasting tikhamarine et al 2020 therefore the input combinations recommended by filtered methods should not be directly applied to data driven methods and it is better to consider different input scenarios 2 prediction results of arima and rf models table 6 lists the forecasting results obtained by arima and rf models for kizil reservoir as suggested by ministry of water resources p r c 2008 ni et al 2020 a qr value that is higher than 60 can be considered applicable for streamflow forecasting in arima the value of qr is 54 023 which indicates that the arima is not satisfactory in simulating the monthly reservoir inflow 4 2 performance evaluation of embedded feature selection algorithm methods for a fair comparison the main parameters of efs svmgwo and efs svmigwo are the same as those of svmgwo and svmigwo as shown in table 4 the detailed statistical indices of the results are listed in table 7 to appraise the consistency and stability of all the considered methods box plots for the ca and qr accuracy metrics with 20 independent operations during the testing phase are also shown in fig 12 boxplots have five elements minimum maximum median median first quartile and third quartile of the data the box mat has a line inside which refers to the median value abd elminaam et al 2021 in the box plot the y axis represents the method s name and the x axis depicts the respective performance criterion from the box plots as expected compared with the benchmark methods efs svmigwo presented a relatively smaller standard deviation and consistent results for all performance metrics in filter based methods the prediction performance of svmigwo is slightly better than that of svmgwo and svmgs while the stability and accuracy of the prediction results of the model optimized by igwo in the embedded based methods are stronger this validates the robustness of the proposed efs svmigwo method for selecting a prominent feature set from a high dimensional dataset in addition when using the same feature input the svm based model provides decent performance in terms of stability and accuracy of the prediction results compared to the ann based model the reason for the better prediction accuracy of the svm model than the ann model primarily lies in the shortcomings of the latter e g overfitting curse of dimensionality and convergence to local minimum conversely the svm model is based on the vc dimension theory and the structural risk minimization principle which can overcome these limitations in theory therefore the svm model has a better prediction accuracy than the ann model huang et al 2014 the improved percentage indices including pmape pnrmse pnse pca and pqr between the efs svmigwo model and benchmark models are given in table 8 table 8 shows that the proposed advanced model efs svmigwo exhibits the best performance in terms of all indices in the testing phase for instance compared with arima rf anngwo m6 svmigwo m3 and efs svmgwo the mape reducing percentages by efs svmigwo are 16 54 15 52 11 08 1 76 and 3 13 respectively the ca reducing percentages by efs svmigwo are 6 59 5 69 5 61 4 29 and 3 2 respectively and the qr promoting percentages by efs svmigwo are 21 28 2 8 9 09 0 13 and 2 01 respectively this indicates that synchronous optimization of feature and model parameters of the embedded modeling approach played a positive role in improving the prediction performance and the igwo technique is superior to the gwo technique in the model training process of monthly streamflow time series to further examine the superiority of efs svmigwo comparisons between efs svmigwo and the benchmark models including arima rf anngwo m6 and svmigwo m3 are made the graphical illustrations of the hydrograph and scatter plots of both the observed data and the predicted data in the test period are illustrated in figs 13 and 14 in which models are compared visually based on their average performance of 20 independent operations from the hydrograph plot of fig 13 one can clearly see that all forecasting methods are capable of tracking the dynamic changes in monthly streamflow as can be seen from the detail graphs in fig 13 the efs svmigwo model is much closer to the corresponding observed data than the benchmark models fig 14 clearly shows that all of the models obtained satisfactory results in terms of low values 2 108 m3 while tending to underestimate high values higher than 6 108 m3 and overestimate medium flows 3 6 108 m3 compared with low flows high flow prediction seemed to be more scattered indicating the difficulty of capturing the high flow patterns the reasons lie in the inadequate observations of extreme flow events in the training dataset used in estimating the model s parameters and the developed models fail to learn the complex pattern for operational predication yaseen et al 2016 niu and feng 2021 however despite this efs svmigwo seemed to have a better forecast than the other models as the scatterplots showed that the points estimated by efs svmigwo are closer to the diagonal line also the higher value of the coefficient of determination r2 confirms the superiority of efs svmigwo over other models 4 3 performance of metaheuristics in feature selection and parameter optimization to validate the efficiency of igwo 5 classical state of the art metaheuristic algorithms are selected to compare with this optimizer these evolutionary algorithms include de ssa pso woa and gwo mirjalili et al 2014 mirjalili and lewis 2016 shekhawat et al 2021 as shown in table 9 in all experiments the parameters of the comparative algorithms are decided considering the past literature in addition the population size and the number of iterations for each algorithm are 25 and 100 and the final results of the operations are shown in tables 10 and 11 and figs 15 and 16 table 11 shows that compared with efs svmgwo efs svmde efs svmssa efs svmpso and efs svmwoa the ca reducing percentages by efs svmigwo are 3 2 2 82 4 04 27 31 and 10 54 respectively and the qr promoting percentages by efs svmigwo are 2 01 2 75 1 6 17 47 and 5 9 respectively fig 15 clearly shows that the optimization of the algorithms involved in the validation presents three levels i e igwo has the best optimization ability gwo ssa and de are the next best and pso and woa are the worst the results also can be verified in figure 16 which shows the fitness value average training accuracy of the best solution the best subset of features with 20 independent runs obtained by each method during the optimization process according to fig 16 it can be summarized as follows 1 as shown by the curves in fig 16 a in the same type of prediction model such as filter based methods svmgwo m3 vs svmigwo m3 or embedded based methods efs svmgwo vs efs svmigwo the fitness values obtained by igwo were always lower than those obtained by gwo in the whole iteration course 2 it can be observed from fig 16 b that the fitness curve of igwo completely converges after the 25th iteration while the fitness curve of pso woa ssa de and gwo just started to converge from the 41th 39th 80th 92th and 48th iteration respectively moreover it can also be observed that the fitness value of igwo is always smaller than that of pso woa ssa de and gwo in the whole iteration course it indicates that igwo not only converges more quickly but also obtains better solution quality than pso woa ssa de and gwo the above results show that the igwo algorithm improved the encircling mechanism and that the initialization mechanism of the gwo algorithm has a good balance between exploration and exploitation during its search for the best solution avoiding random searches while escaping from local minima in addition the above analysis also shows that the prediction ability of efs based methods can be further improved by improving the computational performance of the optimization algorithm 4 4 analysis of feature selection results the prediction results of various models in table 5 show that m1 and m2 inputs have poor performance compared with the m3 m4 m5 and m6 andthese models have serious underfitting which indicates that the selection of input features is critical to the model s prediction performance table 12 lists the selected frequency of each feature in the process of feature selection by efs svmgwo and efs svmigwo for efs svmigwo the selected times of the qt 1 qt 2 qt 3 qt 6 qt 8 qt 11 and qt 12 features are 10 times which indicates that these chosen features are important features in the kizil reservoir dataset and should be given more attention in the decision making process table 12 shows that the frequencies of qt 7 qt 9 and qt 10 selected by efs svmgwo are higher than 15 which is consistent with the input feature recommended by the partial autocorrelation analysis in table 2 their counterparts in pacf are 0 19 0 17 and 0 25 respectively however for efs svmigwo the frequencies of the counterpart features are lower than5 in addition for efs svmigwo qt 3 is an important feature but the contradiction is that the pacf value of qt 3 is equal to 0 the above results show that the selection of the qt 3 qt 7 qt 9 and qt 10 features is the direct reason for the difference between efs svmigwo and the benchmark models the above analysis shows that including a high number of inputs does not guarantee better forecasting accuracy because increasing the number of inputs may increase the variance and add more complexity to the implemented model which will deteriorate the model prediction accuracy tikhamarine et al 2020 conversely carefully selected characteristic variables can produce accurate and reliable prediction results in monthly runoff prediction 4 5 advantages limitations and future improvement the embedded feature selection method improves the compactness of the model by searching feasible parameters and feature combinations in the state space which can then improve the generalization ability of the model to a certain extent in this study based on the principle of embedded feature selection an embedded model coupling svm with igwo is proposed to improve monthly streamflow forecasting svm is adopted as the base model for its great advantages for example they are simple but still powerful predictive algorithms with fewer hyperparameters to optimize which are easy to calibrate as we can see from the experimental results the embedded feature selection technique and its svm igwo realization attain the aforementioned desirable goals which can serve as worthy technical references for the global research community in terms of hydrological prediction it has demonstrated that the efs svmigwo method achieves a good balance between feature selection and prediction model parameter rates in the modeling process avoiding the problem of feature and parameter dissonance although the performance improvement of efs svmigwo is not significant compared to the benchmark model efs has a higher level of robustness and automation it automatically selects features and parameters by heuristic algorithm which can reduce the workload of traditional models using trial and error method to select optimal feature vectors and reduce the risk of incompatibility between feature vectors and prediction models overall the embedded prediction model effectively simplifies the construction process of traditional ai models and has great potential for development in the field of hydrology which can provide a worthy technical reference for the global hydrological prediction research community note that although the feasibility of efs svmigwo for monthly runoff prediction is verified utilizing real world data they should be validated in more candidate feature types which is the main limitation of this study in this study the investigated efs svmigwo model yielded stream flow forecasts based on historical stream flow data however runoff time series are stochastic and nonlinear in nature and depend upon many hydrological variables e g rainfall temperature snowmelt humidity and evaporation and large scale climatic phenomena e g sea surface temperatures or climate mode indices therefore this work can be extended in the future by accumulating and incorporating more types of candidate feature data in addition the new efs svmigwo lacks further research and analysis for other fields and it can be applied in other fields such as groundwater table forecasting to test its performance 5 conclusion this paper investigated the potential of the embedded feature selection methods and its svm igwo realization for forecasting monthly runoff in basins lacking meteorological observations to our knowledge this is the first work that uses the embedded methods algorithm to solve the fs problem in hydrologic prediction the experiments are applied to the kizil reservoir in china and five evaluation criteria and graphical methods are assessed to evaluate the performance of these methods the experimental results shows that the proposed efs svmigwo model performed well in the case study as it obtained a quite high nse of 0 82 0 75 and a low mape of 17 81 20 it can be observed from the hydrographs that the predictions followed the same trends as the observed trends efs svmigwo is applicable for streamflow forecasting and in general superior to the conventional prediction models arima rf that do not require the determination of feature vectors and prediction models e g ann svm etc based on filtered feature selection methods pacf and rf moreover experimental results also show that the evolutionary strategy adopted by igwo proved to achive excellent global optimization and fast convergence performance in the embedded method optimization task compared to five well known metaheuristics in the recent literature including woa pso gwo ssa and de comparison results indicated that the embedded based method and novel optimizer strategy are conducive to improving forecast accuracy and capturing the dynamic patterns of hydrological processes which can produce convincing models in streamflow prediction therefore the proposed method is a promising alternative for improving the forecasting results of monthly streamflow prediction and provides greater insight into improving forecasting accuracy credit

2399,accurate streamflow prediction plays an essential role in guaranteeing the sustainable utilization and management of water resources in recent years artificial intelligence ai models have been widely used for flow prediction the performance of these models depends on the appropriate calibration of the input features and model parameters theoretically the embedded feature selection method directly takes the final prediction model as a prediction indicator which has the unique advantage of parallel optimization of feature and prediction model parameters compared with other methods despite being widely used in many other fields its streamflow forecasting abilities are thus far unknown in this paper an embedded prediction model efs svmigwo with improved gray wolf optimizer igwo and support vector machine svm is proposed based on the principle of embedded feature selection method and validated with monthly runoff prediction at kizil reservoir station in xinjiang china the validation results demonstrate that the efs svmigwo model has consistently better accuracy and stable values than the benchmark methods including autoregressive integrated moving average random forest neural network and svm models based on filtered selection methods moreover igwo is compared to differential evolution de particle swarm optimization pso whale optimization algorithm woa sparrow search algorithm ssa and gray wolf optimizer gwo and the results show that igwo has better convergence speed and solution quality in feature and model parameter parallel optimization tasks overall research and analysis indicate that the efs svmigwo model can exhibit convincing performance in monthly streamflow forecasting thus it is of great importance to carefully choose the input variables and parameters to develop more effective models for forecasting monthly streamflow time series keywords hydrologic time series improved gray wolf algorithm streamflow prediction support vector machine feature selection data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction streamflow is the basic and critical component of global and regional hydrological cycles accurate and robust streamflow prediction is considered one of the most stable and practical technical measures to support the scientific management and operation of water resource systems niu and feng 2021 however streamflow is typically affected by numerous factors such as solar radiation underlying surfaces and atmospheric circulation exhibiting complex nonlinearity high uncertainty and randomness phenomena rezaie balf et al 2019 deb et al 2019 the development of powerful methods with high levels of reliability to achieve accurate forecasting remains a major challenge rezaie balf et al 2019 to date a large variety of streamflow prediction models have been proposed mainly classified as process driven models and data driven models process driven models represent the physical process under hydrological variables by governing mathematical equations which are good at providing insight into catchment processes while these methods typically require a large amount of calibration data and some degree of expertise and experience with the models which limits practical applications prasad et al 2017 compared to physical models data driven models use past observations to mine and extend time varying relationships within time series and are widely used in practice due to their simplicity of design and implementation and relative accuracy in prediction problems meng et al 2021 yaseen et al 2016 data driven models can be further classified into time series models and artificial intelligence ai models time series models such as autoregressive integrated moving average arima and multiple linear regression mlr liu et al 2012 büyükşahin and ertekin 2019 their applications are limited by assumptions of normality linearity and variable independence he et al 2020 compared with time series models ai models have the advantages of self organization and adaptive learning and can better handle noisy data in nonlinear dynamic systems liu and chen 2019 the widely used ai models include artificial neural network ann yang et al 2017 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis zhou et al 2019 extreme learning machine elm generalized regression neural network grnn diop et al 2018 random forest rf and support vector machine svm a few studies have investigated the performance of the above ai models in earth science fields for example the performances of mlr ann elm and svm in deriving operation rule of hydropower reservoir are compared in ref niu et al 2019 the performances of ann elm anfis and svm in forecasting daily streamflow are compared in ref niu and feng 2021 the performances of ann elm and svm in forecasting monthly runoff are compared in ref feng et al 2020 the existing research reports have fully demonstrated the superiority of the svm over ann elm and anfis a review of the application of svm in the field of hydrology can be found in ref raghavendra and deka 2014 streamflow series comprise of periods trends and noise components and the process of the streamflow is complicated these pure ai models cannot always adequately capture the characteristics of hydrological series due to inherent disadvantages such as a lack of theoretical standards for determining parameters and insufficient robustness to noise zhao et al 2021 meng et al 2021 in general it has been proved that identifying the optimal parameter combination is a vital step in the successfulness of the forecasting models adnan et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 metaheuristic approaches such as differential evolution de particle swarm optimization pso sparrow search algorithm ssa and the whale optimization algorithm woa have been widely used in the last two decades and are more efficient in dealing with the optimization process zhang et al 2021 in contrast to the exhaustive search brute force search and random search mechanisms metaheuristics can be considered as directed random algorithms and may determine a near optimal solution from an exponential set of feasible solutions in a reasonable time shekhawat et al 2021 the gray wolf optimizer gwo is a successful metaheuristic that mimics the hunting behavior and the social leadership hierarchy of gray wolves in nature nadimi shahraki et al 2021 compared to other similar techniques the gwo algorithm has very few parameters to tune and benefits from several adaptive mechanisms to deal with search landscapes of different shapes clustering classification regression and other function optimization tasks emary et al 2016 faris et al 2019 since the gwo algorithm was introduced by mirjalili et al in 2014 its application has not ceased and the first published gwo article has been cited 5600 times in a short time span however similar to other metaheuristic algorithms the standard gwo easily falls into local minima many scholars have tried to improve the gwo algorithm which has enhanced the optimization capability of the algorithm to different degrees on the other hand feature selection fs approaches are a major way to improve the performance of single models since they provide essential information about the designed system feature selection can be defined as the process of identifying and eliminating features that are irrelevant or harmful to pattern extraction in order to obtain better faster and more comprehensible solutions for machine learning tasks according to the style of evaluating fs techniques can be categorized into model free approaches filter methods and model based approaches including wrapper and embedded methods this is shown in fig 1 model free approaches are usually known as filter based feature selection ffs methods since they select the set of features independently from the learning algorithm rezaie balf et al 2019 generally ffs executes a statistical measure e g distance dependency consistency or information between the input variables and the target variables to allocate a score to each feature then all the features are further ranked by these scores to select relevant features zhu et al 2017 ren et al 2020 the linear pearson correlation partial correlation function pacf random forests rf and mutual information mi are popular measurements used in filter methods zarshenas and suzuki 2016 ren et al 2020 although ffs is faster than other correlation methods these methods are generally linear correlation ranking methods and they usually treat each candidate variable separately which ignores the relationship between various features quilty et al 2016 another drawback is that these methods cannot work with redundant information zhang et al 2021 the model based approaches generate different subsets of features using some search strategy and evaluate the performance of selected feature subsets with the aid of a machine learning algorithm clustering classification or regression during the search for the optimal subset which are generally divided into wrapper feature selection methods and embedded feature selection efs the focus of this paper the difference between these two classes lies in the fact that the efs select the optimal features during the prediction model calibration phase which integrate feature selection and the prediction model tuning into a single process while the wrapper methods treat the prediction model as a pure black box and the feature selection model used in these is independent of the prediction model pashaei and aydin 2017 searching for the optimal feature subset among an unabridged dataset is a challenging task due to two main issues aljarah et al 2018 the first is the complexity of the interaction between features al tashi et al 2020 the second is the huge search space the possible total number of solutions for an m dimensional feature set is as large as 2m which determines that feature selection is an np hard problem faris et al 2018 in hydrological simulation existing feature selection methods include filter techniques liu et al 2014 he et al 2020 luo et al 2019 trial and error approach based on filter techniques or hydrological expertise sudheer et al 2013 mehdizadeh and sales 2018 tan et al 2018 niu and feng 2021 yaseen et al 2016 karimi et al 2018 he et al 2014 and wrapper methods alizadeh et al 2020 in general existing prediction models are time consuming and not accurate enough while some filtering approaches may be useful for reducing the number of inputs included in the set of candidates it fails to capture the typical interdependencies redundancies and nonlinearities in hydrologic systems snieder et al 2020 in the field of machine learning there is a large body of literature developing fs extraction method based on heuristic algorithms to solve clustering and classification problems however pertinent issues of variable selection have not been adequately addressed in the field of hydrologic prediction and the feature selection consistently receives little attention prasad et al 2017 taormina and chau 2015 the original intention of the efs technique is to realize the synchronous optimization of features and model parameters in the process of model calibration unlike common feature selection methods filter techniques and wrapper methods this method automatically determines the optimal feature vector based on the simulation results of the final prediction model compared with common methods the efs are more accurate and robust as they focus on development of the final prediction model and can take different data properties into account e g manifold structure data distribution priors and data reconstruction zhu et al 2017 theoretically efs have obvious advantages over wrapper and other feature selection methods in feature selection despite these advantages to the best of the authors knowledge the potential has never been explored in the existing hydrological prediction literature however efs methods are computationally more expensive and their performance strongly depends on a calibrated model ai model pashaei and aydin 2017 despite the important contribution of metaheuristics in the field of feature selection in most cases the best solution is not obtained because the optimization problem of the ai model involved in feature selection is ignored segera et al 2020 determining the best architecture of ai models is vital for increasing the accuracy of prediction by the model and also to reduce run time molajou et al 2021 it is worth noting that for neural network based ai models ann mlr and anfis etc their structural design is a difficult task including the number of hidden layers the number of hidden node neurons and adjustment of different factors e g epoch number and connection weights their number varies with the variables of the input model and the number is generally higher than 15 tikhamarine et al 2020 abbasi et al 2021 niu and feng 2021 if the above ai model is chosen as the base prediction model for efs this further increases the computational difficulty of efs in comparison svm model has less control parameters only 3 hyperparameters need to be optimized and stronger nonlinear mapping ability meng et al 2021 which is a significant advantage in building efs models in order to rectify the problem of feature selection in hydrological prediction modeling this paper integrates the advantages of the svm and igwo methods proposes a runoff feature extraction and prediction method based on embedded methods and investigates its potential for accurate monthly stream forecasting in a semiarid region the major contribution of this work can be summarized as follows 1 different from traditional runoff forecasting models a novel one based on embedded feature extraction method is proposed the model uses svm as the base prediction model and integrates the svm hyperparameter optimization task and feature selection problem in the metaheuristic search process to achieve automatic calibration of the model 2 to solve the embedded prediction problem a metaheuristic algorithm coding method with mixed binary and real number encoding is introduced in addition an improved gray wolf algorithm igwo using a tent chaotic mapping initialization population and a nonlinear convergence factor strategy is proposed 3 the predictive power of the proposed model efs svmigwo is verified against conventional prediction models arima rf that do not require the determination of feature vectors and prediction models e g ann svm etc based on filtered feature selection methods pacf and rf the search capability of the igwo algorithm for embedded modeling optimization tasks is also verified with state of the art metaheuristics gwo ssa woa pso and de 4 experimental results demonstrate that the proposed efs svmigwo method provide more precise and stable forecasting results compared to the benchmark models the igwo achieves promising performance when compared with the state of art metaheuristics in the recent literature the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows section 2 provides a detailed introduction to the methodologies including a description of the necessary basic theory the proposed svm based embedded methods and performance evaluation criteria section 3 describes the catchment properties of the study area and model development the principal results and relevant discussion are detailed in section 4 finally conclusions are highlighted in the last section of the paper 2 methodology 2 1 basic concepts regression models seek to quantify relationships existing between a process response variable and a set of potential drivers features or explanatory variables that may contain relevant irrelevant redundant and or noisy information quilty et al 2016 the negative information used as part of the training procedure is likely to worsen the model s underlying complexity and trigger poor generalization performance prasad et al 2017 salcedo sanz et al 2014 in general fs aims to select the optimal feature vector feature subset among the original set of features by eliminating the redundant and or irrelevant features taradeh et al 2019 alizadeh et al 2020 the feature input variable selection task can be addressed in the following way for n pairs of samples d x i y i i 1 n where x i r q y i r k q is the total available features k is the forecast lead time and we choose a subset of m features m q that achieves the lowest error in the prediction of y i salcedo sanz et al 2014 forecasting river flow using memory i e the time lag of stream flow is an effective method of prediction in hydrology if qt is the streamflow to be forecasted antecedent streamflows qt 1 qt 2 qt q are selected as alternative factors where qt q denotes the q antecedent variables of the forecast month luo et al 2019 as shown in fig 2 the past observations that are significantly correlated with the response variables are taken as the best feature vector fv the best sample set is extracted according to fv and further divided into training samples and testing samples fang et al 2019 2 2 support vector machine svm the support vector machine svm algorithm was introduced by vapnik vapnik 1995 on the basis of statistical learning theory the basic principle of svm for regression is to map the data into a high dimensional feature space via nonlinear mapping ϕ in which the nonlinear separable problem becomes linearly separable in space therefore linear regression is performed in that feature space wang and hu 2015 fig 3 shows a sketch map of the svm model niu and feng 2021 the regression formula is defined as 1 f x i w i ϕ x i b where w i is an adjustable weight vector and b stands for the scalar threshold also known as bias b r the error between response variables y i and fitting values f x i is evaluated using the following ε insensitive loss function l ε 2 l ε f x i y i f x i y i ε f x i y i ε 0 f x i y i ε where ε is related to smoothening the complexity of the approximation function which means that errors less than ε will be ignored fig 4 describes the loss function formulation using l ε one can find f x that can better approximate the response variables y and has the at most error tolerance ε from the actual incurred targets y i for all training data and concurrently as flat as possible w and b can be obtained from the data by optimizing the following convex optimization problem huang et al 2014 3 min g w b ξ i ξ i 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i s t y i w ϕ x i b ε ξ i w ϕ x i b y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 i 1 2 n where ξ i and ξ i are slack variables introduced to measure the deviation of training samples outside the ε insensitive zone fig 4 the former part of objective function 1 2 w 2 represents the generalization ability of the regression function while the latter part stands for the empirical risk based on the ε insensitive loss function the parameter c is a weight penalty constant that adjusts the weight between the two components by controlling the extent of samples exceeding ε ji et al 2014 the above svm optimization problem is usually solved in its dual form using lagrange multipliers and the regression function for the svm model can be expressed as follows niu and feng 2021 feng et al 2020 4 f x i 1 n a i a i k x x i b where k x i x represents the kernel function satisfying mercer s condition in the literature many studies have shown that the radial basis function rbf has better performance in handling high dimensional complex samples and is easy to implement with fewer parameters compared to gaussian kernel functions and polynomial kernel functions meng et al 2021 here the rbf is chosen as the kernel function k x y exp x y 2 2 σ 2 σ is the width of the rbf kernel in this study svr models were implemented using matlab software and libsvm version 3 23 developed by chang and lin 2011 2 3 metaheuristic approaches 2 3 1 standard gwo algorithm generally the gwo algorithm considers three leader wolves named alpha α beta β and delta δ as the best solutions to lead the rest of the wolves candidate solutions named omega ω toward promising areas to find the global solution nadimi shahraki et al 2021 the gray wolves complete their predation following three steps encircling hunting and attacking this process is repeated until the fittest solution is obtained mirjalili et al 2014 guo et al 2021 1 encircling the prey considering x as the wolf position and xp as the prey position dp is the distance between the prey and a given wolf the new position of each wolf while encircling the prey can be determined as 5 x t 1 x p t a t d p d p c t x p t x t where t is the current iteration and a t and c t are coefficient vectors calculated by eq 6 6 a t 2 a t r 1 a t c t 2 r 2 a t 2 2 t t where r 1 and r 2 are random numbers r 1 r 2 0 1 and a are transition parameters that linearly decrease from 2 to 0 over the course of iterations and t is the maximum number of iterations of the algorithm 2 hunting the prey fig 5 presents how the search wolves change their location with respect to α β and δ in the search space tikhamarine et al 2020 alamiedy et al 2020 to simulate the prey it is assumed that the wolves of α β and δ have better knowledge about the location of the prey nadimi shahraki et al 2021 accordingly α β and δ define the location of the prey and the other wolves renew their locations randomly around the prey by using the following equations 7 x t 1 x 1 x 2 x 3 3 8 x 1 x α t a 1 t d α t d α t c 1 t x α t x t x 2 x β t a 2 t d β t d β t c 2 t x β t x t x 3 x δ t a 3 t d δ t d δ t c 3 t x δ t x t where x α t x β t and x δ t correspond to the α β and δ wolves and they are the first three best wolves solutions at iteration t a 1 a 2 a 3 c 1 c 2 and c 3 can be calculated by eq 6 3 searching and attacking the prey parameter a is used to determine a which leads the wolves toward the prey in a linear decrement manner from the original literature on gwo a 1 and or c 1 indicates that the wolves diverge from the current prey to achieve a global search exploration phase while a 1 and or c 1 indicates that the wolves are forced to attack the prey exploitation phase guo et al 2021 a detailed flowchart of the gwo algorithm is shown in fig 7 c first the algorithm generates an initial population of wolves within the search space by eq 9 the location of the wolf is evaluated by calculating the fitness then the following steps are repeated until the stopping criterion is satisfied the stopping criterion is to reach the predefined number of iterations more detailed information about the gwo algorithm can be found in mirjalili et al 2014 9 x ij l j r a n d j 0 1 u j l j where xij is the position of the ith wolf in the jth dimension n is the number of wolves in the population and d is the dimension number of the problem i 1 n j 1 d 2 3 2 improved gray wolf optimizer igwo effective balancing between the exploitation local search and exploration global search in a metaheuristic plays a crucial role in achieving excellent performance of an algorithm nadimi shahraki et al 2021 gwo is good at exploitation but inefficient at exploration and it is not sufficient for obtaining a feasible solution segera et al 2020 in the standard gwo a wolf search depends on the leading wolves and once the initial population selection is not appropriate gwo will face the risk of falling into the global optimum additionally in the standard gwo the algorithm begins with the exploration process as the transition parameter a is linearly decreased from 2 to 0 over the iterations eq 6 the algorithm moves gradually from emphasizing the exploration process to exploitation however the search process of the gwo algorithm is both nonlinear and complicated when the leading wolves become trapped at one local optimum it is difficult for the group to escape from it according to this search mechanism guo et al 2021 to overcome these issues in this section an improved gray wolf optimizer igwo is proposed nadimi shahraki et al 2021 the modified gwo fortifies against these issues using two strategies 1 initialize populations using tent chaos mapping chaotic mapping has the characteristics of ergodicity and randomness which can improve the diversity of populations and explore the search space more comprehensively within a certain range the way to improve the initialized population using tent mapping is shown in eq 10 and 11 10 x ij l j α j u j l j 11 α j ran d j 0 1 b 0 r a n d j 0 1 b 1 r a n d j 0 1 1 b b r a n d j 0 1 1 where b is the control parameter and b 0 5 is the typical form of tent mapping which corresponds to a more uniform population distribution 2 improved encircling mechanism a nonlinear convergence factor strategy is used to replace this linear decrement as follows guo et al 2021 12 a t 2 2 t t 2 the graphical representation of a is shown in fig 6 which shows that a decreases at a lower gradient in the initial phase and it is clear that the exploration phase of igwo grows from 50 to 70 iterations when the maximum number of iterations is 100 compared to the standard gwo this improved strategy compels the wolves to diverge from the leading wolves with this search strategy even if a gray wolf is going to a worse place than it is now it still must arrive which makes gwo more flexible and reinforces the global search ability thus avoiding premature convergence additionally the decline in acceleration at the later stage contributes to fast convergence guo et al 2021 2 4 embedded feature selection techniques 2 4 1 sketch of the methodologies in general three key elements must be specified when utilizing an embedded method predictor evaluation criteria of the feature subset and search algorithm to find the best combination of features al tashi et al 2019 in this paper an embedded feature selection efs prediction method that uses igwo as a search algorithm and svm as a predictor was proposed this efs svmigwo is centered on parallel optimization of feature selection and parameters using candidate features predefined by partial autocorrelation function pacf values the complete system architecture of efs svmgwo can be seen in fig 7 and the key steps of the proposed model can be described as follows step 1 original training set transformation 1 historical runoff data are divided into training and test series in chronological order 2 the pacf values are estimated for the runoff data on the training series and the number of continuous time series lagged data values maximum time lag is determined based on the correlation coefficients at each lag time 3 based on the maximum time lag the original training matrix is extracted from the training series step 2 training model 1 efs svmigwo uses igwo to generate a series of solutions i e a combination of parameters and feature vectors and each solution is used to train the svm predictor using a 10 fold cv strategy to obtain the corresponding fitness value 2 this process is cycled several times and the optimal solution is finally obtained by solving comparing and updating the solution for each cycle 3 once the best solution is obtained the training and test sets are reextracted based on the best feature vector and the optimized svm prediction model is recalibrated on the training set using the best parameters step 3 obtain final forecasts after the training stage the final svm prediction model is tested on the independent test set analyze the error and compare the prediction accuracy 2 4 2 gray wolf position encoding 1 individual encoding in the feature optimization process applying the predictor svm with optimized parameters is a necessary prerequisite for objective evaluation of feature subsets and thus efs is a hybrid optimization problem to formulate the efs prediction method as an optimization problem two key points should be carefully considered the first is the representation of the problem which comprises the encoding of the individuals in the algorithm and the representation of the population how to represent a solution the second point is the selection of a suitable fitness function to evaluate the quality of the individuals considering them as candidate solutions to the targeted problem how to evaluate a solution faris et al 2019 the solution in efs svmigwo is represented as a one dimensional vector with hybrid encoding as shown in fig 8 and consists of two main parts the svm parameter part and the feature selection mask feature vector part the first part parameters consists of 3 bits which indicate a combination of hyperparameters of the svm within a continuous space the second part feature selection masks is represented with binary strings of the total number of original features each mask is responsible for the existence of its corresponding feature to illustrate the feature at a certain location that is selected or not value 1 denotes that the corresponding attribute is selected whereas 0 means discarded feature selection is a binary optimization problem where solutions are restricted to the binary 0 1 values zarshenas and suzuki 2016 however the gwo algorithm was originally designed to solve optimization problems in continuous space and hence cannot be utilized directly to solve feature selection problems al tashi et al 2020 one of the popular methods to convert a continuous optimizer to suit binary problems is to use transfer functions tf mirjalili and lewis 2013 the purpose of tf is to define a probability of updating an element in the feature subset solution to be 1 selected or 0 not selected aljarah et al 2018 to squash the continuous solutions in each dimension of the feature encoding an s shaped transfer function is chosen in this study as the follows zhang et al 2017 13 p v i 1 e x i t 1 where x indicates the continuous position of the search agent and x i t indicates the i th dimension in the x solution depending on the produced probability pv from eq 13 the binary value is updated using eq 14 14 x i t 0 p v i 0 5 1 p v i 0 5 2 population encoding a population in igwo is a set of individuals who are updated over the course of iterations the population has a predefined fixed number of individuals each of which forms a candidate solution for our problem the population is defined as a matrix p of a size of n q 3 as shown in eq 15 where n is the number of individuals in the population each row in the matrix represents an individual according to the results of adnan et al 2021 the population and the number of iterations were set to 25 and 100 respectively 15 p c 1 σ 1 ε 1 f 11 f 12 f 13 f 1 q c 2 σ 2 ε 2 f 21 f 22 f 23 f 2 q c n σ n ε n f n 1 f n 2 f n 3 f nq 2 4 3 fitness function the encoding described in the previous section is used to build svm models with different structures and the selection of the optimal structure depends on the objective function chosen to assess the svm accuracy in the literature many studies have shown that the prediction accuracy of a model cannot be examined well using a single statistical indicator zhou et al 2019 however the existing studies commonly use a single statistical metric e g mean square error as the optimization objective which is usually biased in this study the combined value of normalized root mean square error nrmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and mean absolute percentage error mape was chosen as the optimization objective of the igwo algorithm considering both the accuracy and stability of the prediction results as depicted in eq 16 during the training stage a 10 fold cross validation cv scheme was used to evaluate the combination of parameters and feature vectors to eliminate possible bias prevent overfitting in selecting the test and training sets a detailed flowchart of the 10 fold cv is shown in fig 7 b the arithmetic mean accuracy of 10 validations was used as the fitness value see eq 17 and the final combination with the minimum fitness is considered to be the optimal combination

basin is formed by the confluence of five tributaries originating from the southern slopes of the tianshan mountains in xinjiang china each of which flows separately and converges at the kizil reservoir in the baicheng basin before disappearing near the northern bank of the tarim river a brief introduction of the study area illustrated in fig 9 is made as follows the ogan river basin is located between 41 06 42 50 n latitude and 80 53 82 52 e longitude the basin terrain is high in the north and low in the south with an elevation decreasing from 6231 m to 1022 m and the landform type is complex and variable in this region the catchment area of the basin is 1 7 104 km2 the total length of the main stream is 452 km and the length of the river below kizil reservoir is 170 km the ogan river basin is a typical arid inland river basin and the climate is characterized by infrequent rain strong evaporation large diurnal temperature differences adequate sunshine and dry air the mean annual temperature evaporation and precipitation in the basin are 8 1 1 964 4 mm and 115 6 mm respectively and evaporation from may to august accounts for 60 9 of the annual evaporation runoff in the basin mainly consists of glacial meltwater snowmelt runoff and rainfall runoff and the precipitation from june to august accounts for about 45 8 of the annual precipitation kizil reservoir is a large basin controlled water conservancy project built in xinjiang with a design capacity of 6 4 108 m3 it is mainly used for irrigation and water regulation and also has comprehensive benefits such as flood control and power generation over the past half century the management and sustainability of water resources in the ogan river basin have experienced a negative deterioration due to climate change and large scale water and soil development this has brought to the fore a series of ecological and environmental problems such as river disconnection declining groundwater levels natural vegetation degradation and land desertification in the basin one month ahead forecasting for streamflow at kizil reservoir is crucial for water resource decision making to ensure the proper management of water in regard to different water use types therefore robust monthly runoff prediction in this region plays a vital role in supporting sustainable economic and social development the historical monthly runoff records from january 1961 to december 2018 696 records at the kizil reservoir were used to evaluate the proposed model and the other state of the art models the records were collected from the ogan river basin authority the monthly runoff records were computed from the instantaneous values in m3 s observed at 08 00 each day to partition the data into the model development training and model evaluation testing parts the runoff series was separated into the training portion and test portion following the 75 and 25 division principle this is consistent with the suggestion of nelson and illingworth 1990 who supported the idea of 20 30 of data for testing nelson and illingworth 1991 stojković et al 2017 in addition this scene was adopted in previous studies rezaie balf et al 2017 hadi et al 2020 adnan et al 2021 3 2 characterization of the data table 1 summarizes the statistical properties of the monthly streamflow data including training testing and the complete data span the variations in streamflow at kizil reservoir are presented in fig 10 which shows that the streamflow of the reservoir varies within a relatively wide range and exhibits strong monthly periodicity and interannual variability fig 10 c shows that the basin runoff precipitation and average temperature show a fluctuating upward trend during the period 1961 2018 in the past 30 years the basin has experienced frequent extreme hydrological events e g superstandard floods in 1999 2002 2010 and 2016 table 1 shows that the sample entropy of the training data 0 48 is lower than that of the test data 0 61 indicating that there is more random noise component in the test set than in the training set and fig 10 b also shows a significant difference in the distribution of the training and test data the significant covariate bias between the two data sets can be speculated that the established prediction model may have difficulties in extrapolation the model cannot estimate data outside the training range 3 3 candidate feature identification streamflow with a 1 month lag usually has a relatively similar value to the current flow the high correlation between the runoff with 11 and 12 month lags and the current flow reflects the annual streamflow variation while flows with a shorter lag such as 6 7 and 8 months imply seasonal fluctuations as well as long term changes from atmospheric circulation luo et al 2019 fig 11 shows the acf and pacf values of the kizil reservoir training series with lags of 0 80 which indicates that the runoff series has a period of 12 months and the acf values peak at a lag of 12 months therefore runoff with a lag of 12 months q t 12 q t 11 q t 1 was selected as a candidate feature tikhamarine et al 2020 luo et al 2019 3 4 benchmark model design to verify the advantages of the embedded based methods modeling and comparative analysis with benchmark methods such as models that do not require the determination of feature vectors arima rf and a series of prediction models based on filtered feature selection methods e g svm and ann were carried out in the study in the experiments only one step ahead forecasting is considered and the detailed calibration process for each type of model is described below 3 4 1 arima model the model is also commonly referred to as arima p d q where p is the number of autoregressive terms q is the number of moving average terms and d stands for the difference of order fig 11 indicates that the monthly streamflow is not a pure ar or ma process but the arma model akaike s information criterion aic was used to select the optimal the ar p and ma q shibata 1976 more details about arima can be found in the literature wang et al 2015 the structure of the optimal model in this study was arima 12 0 11 3 4 2 random forest model random forest rf is one of the most widely used ensemble tree methods which generate a collection of de correlated decision trees and aggregate their results on the one hand rf has been applied to classification and regression problems which have the advantage of not requiring a predetermined feature vector li et al 2020 on the other hand sensitivity valuations within random forests rf are used to measure the importance of variables which has proved to be efficient for feature selection in different application domains masmoudi et al 2020 the parameters of the rf were set as ntree 500 and mtry 4 masmoudi et al 2020 lahouar and slama 2017 abbasi et al 2021 3 4 3 filter based methods 1 input variable combinations determination the feature sensitivity of rf is estimated by the prediction accuracy for the so called out of bag oob samples i e training data not in bootstrap samples more details about rf can be found in the literature masmoudi et al 2020 li et al 2020 pacf and random forest rf are used to compute the importance of the kizil reservoir training series from lag 1 to lag 12 and the results are shown in table 2 the antecedent streamflow with a greater correlation is included in the input variables for the forecasting model luo et al 2019 various input combinations are listed in table 3 in the ai model each input combination corresponds to one model framework and the ai model architecture that performed the best in the training period was determined to be the optimal model by the trial and error method 2 model parameter setting specifically the generalization ability of the svm model relies heavily on the hyperparameters c ε and σ while the performance of the ann also depends on the correct choice of the weights and biases for neurons i e the network parameters fang et al 2019 the correct selection of parameters can be considered an optimization problem and requires a high optimization algorithm to resolve this problem therefore gwo is used to determine the values of the computational parameters in addition the hidden node numbers and activation function are the two basic hyperparameters of the ann model in this study hidden node numbers were decided using the eq 24 which was adopted in the literatures tikhamarine et al 2020 aljarah et al 2019 faris et al 2016 the levenberg marquardt algorithm was employed to adjust the weights and biases for neurons i e the network parameters tan et al 2018 niu and feng 2021 24 j 2 i 1 table 4 gives the major parameters of the ann ann gwo svm svm gwo and svmigwo models more details of the above modeling process can be found at tikhamarine et al 2020 4 forecast results and discussions 4 1 prediction results of the benchmark models 1 prediction results of filter based methods the filter based forecasting models with different input combinations were compared based on their performance for both the simulation training and forecasting testing phases the detailed statistical indices of the results are listed in table 5 and the bolded values indicate the best statistics for each model table 5 shows that the first input m1 of each model had the highest value of the mape nrmse and ca as well as the lowest value of nse and qr in the testing period so the first input has the worst performance among all inputs the corresponding models are ann m1 anngwo m1 svmgs m1 svmgwo m1 and svmigwo m1 for ann anngwo and svmgs methods the 6th input had the lowest value of ca the combined value of nrmse mape and nse while the 2ed input had the highest value of qr in the test stage the prediction results show that the ca and qr values of the 6th input are reduced by ann 20 11 and 4 29 anngwo 8 88 and 3 55 and svmgs 11 57 and 2 61 respectively compared with those of the 2ed input although the qr value of the 6th input is decreased the change range of the ca values is more obvious than that of the qr values so the 6th input was selected as the best fit model for predicting the river flow in this study the corresponding models are ann m6 anngwo m6 and svmgs m6 similarly in svmgwo and svmigwo methods the prediction results of the 3rd and 6th inputs are more advantageous than the other inputs the ca and qr values of the 6th input are increased by svmgwo 3 97 and 4 76 and svmigwo 0 73 and 2 94 compared with those of the 3rd input the 3rd input was chosen as the best fit model and they correspond to the models are svmgwo m3 and svmigwo m3 the above results show that a high number of variable inputs does not guarantee better forecasting accuracy because the added input variables may contain harmful information such as redundancy and noise which deteriorate the model accuracy in forecasting tikhamarine et al 2020 therefore the input combinations recommended by filtered methods should not be directly applied to data driven methods and it is better to consider different input scenarios 2 prediction results of arima and rf models table 6 lists the forecasting results obtained by arima and rf models for kizil reservoir as suggested by ministry of water resources p r c 2008 ni et al 2020 a qr value that is higher than 60 can be considered applicable for streamflow forecasting in arima the value of qr is 54 023 which indicates that the arima is not satisfactory in simulating the monthly reservoir inflow 4 2 performance evaluation of embedded feature selection algorithm methods for a fair comparison the main parameters of efs svmgwo and efs svmigwo are the same as those of svmgwo and svmigwo as shown in table 4 the detailed statistical indices of the results are listed in table 7 to appraise the consistency and stability of all the considered methods box plots for the ca and qr accuracy metrics with 20 independent operations during the testing phase are also shown in fig 12 boxplots have five elements minimum maximum median median first quartile and third quartile of the data the box mat has a line inside which refers to the median value abd elminaam et al 2021 in the box plot the y axis represents the method s name and the x axis depicts the respective performance criterion from the box plots as expected compared with the benchmark methods efs svmigwo presented a relatively smaller standard deviation and consistent results for all performance metrics in filter based methods the prediction performance of svmigwo is slightly better than that of svmgwo and svmgs while the stability and accuracy of the prediction results of the model optimized by igwo in the embedded based methods are stronger this validates the robustness of the proposed efs svmigwo method for selecting a prominent feature set from a high dimensional dataset in addition when using the same feature input the svm based model provides decent performance in terms of stability and accuracy of the prediction results compared to the ann based model the reason for the better prediction accuracy of the svm model than the ann model primarily lies in the shortcomings of the latter e g overfitting curse of dimensionality and convergence to local minimum conversely the svm model is based on the vc dimension theory and the structural risk minimization principle which can overcome these limitations in theory therefore the svm model has a better prediction accuracy than the ann model huang et al 2014 the improved percentage indices including pmape pnrmse pnse pca and pqr between the efs svmigwo model and benchmark models are given in table 8 table 8 shows that the proposed advanced model efs svmigwo exhibits the best performance in terms of all indices in the testing phase for instance compared with arima rf anngwo m6 svmigwo m3 and efs svmgwo the mape reducing percentages by efs svmigwo are 16 54 15 52 11 08 1 76 and 3 13 respectively the ca reducing percentages by efs svmigwo are 6 59 5 69 5 61 4 29 and 3 2 respectively and the qr promoting percentages by efs svmigwo are 21 28 2 8 9 09 0 13 and 2 01 respectively this indicates that synchronous optimization of feature and model parameters of the embedded modeling approach played a positive role in improving the prediction performance and the igwo technique is superior to the gwo technique in the model training process of monthly streamflow time series to further examine the superiority of efs svmigwo comparisons between efs svmigwo and the benchmark models including arima rf anngwo m6 and svmigwo m3 are made the graphical illustrations of the hydrograph and scatter plots of both the observed data and the predicted data in the test period are illustrated in figs 13 and 14 in which models are compared visually based on their average performance of 20 independent operations from the hydrograph plot of fig 13 one can clearly see that all forecasting methods are capable of tracking the dynamic changes in monthly streamflow as can be seen from the detail graphs in fig 13 the efs svmigwo model is much closer to the corresponding observed data than the benchmark models fig 14 clearly shows that all of the models obtained satisfactory results in terms of low values 2 108 m3 while tending to underestimate high values higher than 6 108 m3 and overestimate medium flows 3 6 108 m3 compared with low flows high flow prediction seemed to be more scattered indicating the difficulty of capturing the high flow patterns the reasons lie in the inadequate observations of extreme flow events in the training dataset used in estimating the model s parameters and the developed models fail to learn the complex pattern for operational predication yaseen et al 2016 niu and feng 2021 however despite this efs svmigwo seemed to have a better forecast than the other models as the scatterplots showed that the points estimated by efs svmigwo are closer to the diagonal line also the higher value of the coefficient of determination r2 confirms the superiority of efs svmigwo over other models 4 3 performance of metaheuristics in feature selection and parameter optimization to validate the efficiency of igwo 5 classical state of the art metaheuristic algorithms are selected to compare with this optimizer these evolutionary algorithms include de ssa pso woa and gwo mirjalili et al 2014 mirjalili and lewis 2016 shekhawat et al 2021 as shown in table 9 in all experiments the parameters of the comparative algorithms are decided considering the past literature in addition the population size and the number of iterations for each algorithm are 25 and 100 and the final results of the operations are shown in tables 10 and 11 and figs 15 and 16 table 11 shows that compared with efs svmgwo efs svmde efs svmssa efs svmpso and efs svmwoa the ca reducing percentages by efs svmigwo are 3 2 2 82 4 04 27 31 and 10 54 respectively and the qr promoting percentages by efs svmigwo are 2 01 2 75 1 6 17 47 and 5 9 respectively fig 15 clearly shows that the optimization of the algorithms involved in the validation presents three levels i e igwo has the best optimization ability gwo ssa and de are the next best and pso and woa are the worst the results also can be verified in figure 16 which shows the fitness value average training accuracy of the best solution the best subset of features with 20 independent runs obtained by each method during the optimization process according to fig 16 it can be summarized as follows 1 as shown by the curves in fig 16 a in the same type of prediction model such as filter based methods svmgwo m3 vs svmigwo m3 or embedded based methods efs svmgwo vs efs svmigwo the fitness values obtained by igwo were always lower than those obtained by gwo in the whole iteration course 2 it can be observed from fig 16 b that the fitness curve of igwo completely converges after the 25th iteration while the fitness curve of pso woa ssa de and gwo just started to converge from the 41th 39th 80th 92th and 48th iteration respectively moreover it can also be observed that the fitness value of igwo is always smaller than that of pso woa ssa de and gwo in the whole iteration course it indicates that igwo not only converges more quickly but also obtains better solution quality than pso woa ssa de and gwo the above results show that the igwo algorithm improved the encircling mechanism and that the initialization mechanism of the gwo algorithm has a good balance between exploration and exploitation during its search for the best solution avoiding random searches while escaping from local minima in addition the above analysis also shows that the prediction ability of efs based methods can be further improved by improving the computational performance of the optimization algorithm 4 4 analysis of feature selection results the prediction results of various models in table 5 show that m1 and m2 inputs have poor performance compared with the m3 m4 m5 and m6 andthese models have serious underfitting which indicates that the selection of input features is critical to the model s prediction performance table 12 lists the selected frequency of each feature in the process of feature selection by efs svmgwo and efs svmigwo for efs svmigwo the selected times of the qt 1 qt 2 qt 3 qt 6 qt 8 qt 11 and qt 12 features are 10 times which indicates that these chosen features are important features in the kizil reservoir dataset and should be given more attention in the decision making process table 12 shows that the frequencies of qt 7 qt 9 and qt 10 selected by efs svmgwo are higher than 15 which is consistent with the input feature recommended by the partial autocorrelation analysis in table 2 their counterparts in pacf are 0 19 0 17 and 0 25 respectively however for efs svmigwo the frequencies of the counterpart features are lower than5 in addition for efs svmigwo qt 3 is an important feature but the contradiction is that the pacf value of qt 3 is equal to 0 the above results show that the selection of the qt 3 qt 7 qt 9 and qt 10 features is the direct reason for the difference between efs svmigwo and the benchmark models the above analysis shows that including a high number of inputs does not guarantee better forecasting accuracy because increasing the number of inputs may increase the variance and add more complexity to the implemented model which will deteriorate the model prediction accuracy tikhamarine et al 2020 conversely carefully selected characteristic variables can produce accurate and reliable prediction results in monthly runoff prediction 4 5 advantages limitations and future improvement the embedded feature selection method improves the compactness of the model by searching feasible parameters and feature combinations in the state space which can then improve the generalization ability of the model to a certain extent in this study based on the principle of embedded feature selection an embedded model coupling svm with igwo is proposed to improve monthly streamflow forecasting svm is adopted as the base model for its great advantages for example they are simple but still powerful predictive algorithms with fewer hyperparameters to optimize which are easy to calibrate as we can see from the experimental results the embedded feature selection technique and its svm igwo realization attain the aforementioned desirable goals which can serve as worthy technical references for the global research community in terms of hydrological prediction it has demonstrated that the efs svmigwo method achieves a good balance between feature selection and prediction model parameter rates in the modeling process avoiding the problem of feature and parameter dissonance although the performance improvement of efs svmigwo is not significant compared to the benchmark model efs has a higher level of robustness and automation it automatically selects features and parameters by heuristic algorithm which can reduce the workload of traditional models using trial and error method to select optimal feature vectors and reduce the risk of incompatibility between feature vectors and prediction models overall the embedded prediction model effectively simplifies the construction process of traditional ai models and has great potential for development in the field of hydrology which can provide a worthy technical reference for the global hydrological prediction research community note that although the feasibility of efs svmigwo for monthly runoff prediction is verified utilizing real world data they should be validated in more candidate feature types which is the main limitation of this study in this study the investigated efs svmigwo model yielded stream flow forecasts based on historical stream flow data however runoff time series are stochastic and nonlinear in nature and depend upon many hydrological variables e g rainfall temperature snowmelt humidity and evaporation and large scale climatic phenomena e g sea surface temperatures or climate mode indices therefore this work can be extended in the future by accumulating and incorporating more types of candidate feature data in addition the new efs svmigwo lacks further research and analysis for other fields and it can be applied in other fields such as groundwater table forecasting to test its performance 5 conclusion this paper investigated the potential of the embedded feature selection methods and its svm igwo realization for forecasting monthly runoff in basins lacking meteorological observations to our knowledge this is the first work that uses the embedded methods algorithm to solve the fs problem in hydrologic prediction the experiments are applied to the kizil reservoir in china and five evaluation criteria and graphical methods are assessed to evaluate the performance of these methods the experimental results shows that the proposed efs svmigwo model performed well in the case study as it obtained a quite high nse of 0 82 0 75 and a low mape of 17 81 20 it can be observed from the hydrographs that the predictions followed the same trends as the observed trends efs svmigwo is applicable for streamflow forecasting and in general superior to the conventional prediction models arima rf that do not require the determination of feature vectors and prediction models e g ann svm etc based on filtered feature selection methods pacf and rf moreover experimental results also show that the evolutionary strategy adopted by igwo proved to achive excellent global optimization and fast convergence performance in the embedded method optimization task compared to five well known metaheuristics in the recent literature including woa pso gwo ssa and de comparison results indicated that the embedded based method and novel optimizer strategy are conducive to improving forecast accuracy and capturing the dynamic patterns of hydrological processes which can produce convincing models in streamflow prediction therefore the proposed method is a promising alternative for improving the forecasting results of monthly streamflow prediction and provides greater insight into improving forecasting accuracy credit
