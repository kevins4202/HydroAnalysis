ecosystems liu et al 2017 however it remains unknown to how these anthropogenic changes affect the cyanobacterial community lake taihu meaning large lake in mandarin is china s third largest freshwater lake with an area of 2338 km2 located in the country s most economically developed region fig 1 immense cyanobacterial blooms on this large lake have threatened this vital water supply to approximately 30 million people qin et al 2010 shi et al 2017 for example in may 2007 massive toxic blooms of microcystis led to a highly publicized drinking crisis in the city of wuxi leaving 2 million inhabitants without drinking water for more than one week guo 2007 qin et al 2010 these large scale threats have resulted in the investment of more than 200 billion rmb us 30 billion to fund thousands of projects aimed at clean up efforts in lake taihu cai 2008 during this period the chinese government also closed more than 6000 chemical industries linked to lake taihu water pollution within the next ten years the chinese government plans to invest in many additional projects to further control cyanobacterial blooms and related environmental problems in lake taihu although important for tracking the effects of environmental pollution direct water quality monitoring data for lake taihu only extend back approximately three decades post dating the onset of intense

extracted cyanobacteria from water samples tend to exclude smaller cells 2 μm that may not be captured on the filters used in water sample monitoring kolmonen et al 2004 ye et al 2011 paleolimnological approaches and high throughput sequencing of sedadna are therefore needed to provide important pre impact environmental conditions determine the long term trajectories of potentially toxin producing cyanobacteria and help disentangle the effects of potential stressors here we examined the paleo record from lake taihu to track cyanobacteria responses to environmental changes within the context of the past 100 years specifically we reconstructed changes in the cyanobacterial community structure using high throughput sequencing of sedimentary ancient dna archived in a highly resolved sediment record th19b with chronology established using 210pb gamma spectroscopy fig 1 we aimed to i reconstruct the temporal changes of cyanobacterial community ii identify the timing and tipping point of cyanobacterial community shifts and analyze the community characteristics of the corresponding stages and iii assess the relationships of cyanobacterial taxa especially the potential toxin producers with climate and eutrophic stressors 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment archives in october 2019 a 81 5 cm long gravity core th19b was taken at a water depth of 2 5 m from meiliang bay 31 48 n 120 17 e fig 1 a highly nutrient enriched embayment chen et al 2003 that supports some of lake taihu s densest cyanobacterial blooms shi et al 2017 2019 meiliang bay is located in the northwestern part of this lake and is connected to two main rivers the liangxi and the lujiang which discharge effluents from the nearby cities of wuxi and changzhou the nutrient rich wastewater inputs to the lake mainly originate from these sources in the northern and northwestern parts of the watershed resulting in the most severe cyanobacterial blooms of the lake the th19b core was sliced into 0 5 cm contiguous segments for the length of the core a sediment aliquot was carefully subsampled in a sterilized room and then frozen at 80 c until dna extraction was undertaken the remaining sediments were freeze dried for 210pb dating and physicochemical analyses the uppermost 45 cm of freeze dried sediment were analysed for 210pb activities using a high purity germanium hpge radiation detection system gwl 120 15 ametek usa the ages and sedimentation rates of core th119b were calculated using the constant rate of supply crs model appleby 2001 it is well recognized that sediment tn and tp concentrations are often unreliable as proxies of past nutrient concentrations and commonly do not reflect historical changes in lake trophic conditions ginn et al 2012 thus we only used lakewater quality monitoring data for tn and tp rather than from sediment geochemistry to track long term trends more reliably in nutrient conditions and for conducting statistical analysis with the dna data lakewater measurements of tn mg l and tp mg l that were collected from the northern part of lake taihu between 1987 and 2018 were synthesized from two studies dai et al 2016 wu et al 2019 fig 2 we used the composite nutrient curve for the northern part of the lake because the data for a specific point were not provided by the original literature dai et al 2016 the selected monitoring sites were mainly located in meiliang bay 2 2 meteorological data meteorological data collected from 1956 to 2019 including wind speed m s rainfall mm and temperature c from the nearby 3 km from lake taihu dongshan meteorological station 31 4 n 120 26 e were used for examining potential climatic drivers of cyanobacterial population changes these data were downloaded from the china meteorological data sharing service system https data cma cn additionally mean annual temperature data for the northern hemisphere morice et al 2021 from 1933 to 2019 were included for climatic drivers analysis 2 3 dna extraction amplification and high throughput sequence analysis for each interval in the upper 29 cm of core th19b lake sediment dna was extracted from 0 25 g wet sediment using a power soil dna isolation kit qiagen germany the extracted material was subsequently amplified using indexed algae specific primer pair p23srv f1 p23srv r1 sherwood and presting 2007 this primer set could provide better coverage of cyanobacterial community diversity than the 16s rdna primer set marcelino and verbruggen 2016 the domain v of the 23s rrna gene own universality which could cover most photosynthetic microbial groups presting 2006 sherwood and presting 2007 this primer set has also been widely used in previous studies related to cyanobacterial community e g hou et al 2014 marcelino and verbruggen 2016 presting 2006 sherwood and presting 2007 steven et al 2012 yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 one negative control was added in each batch 15 samples to prevent contamination during the dna extraction and during the polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification the pcr thermal profile was as follows 95 c 2 min 17 cycles with 0 5 c step down cycles from 66 to 58 c for 30 s and then annealing at 58 c for 30 s extension at 72 c for 30 s 18 cycles 94 c 30 s 58 c 30 s 72 c 30 s and final extension at 72 c for 5 min sherwood et al 2008 purified dna was pooled to be sequenced on the illumina hiseq platform illumina inc usa at the magigene company the raw sequencing data obtained were analyzed by a combination of usearch10 and r software providing effective sequences for clustering of amplicon sequence variants asvs based on unoise3 algorithm edgar 2016 and an abundant frequency threshold of 10 the taxonomic identification of representative asvs was done manually using the basic local alignment search tool blast with a similarity threshold of higher than 0 9 to compare with the cultured species in the ncbi database https blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi asvs that were assigned to phytoplankton were kept for subsequent analysis 2 4 statistical analysis nonmetric multi dimensional scaling nmds analysis was based on the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix using the vegan package for r change point analyzer taylor 2000 was used to identify periods of significant change in cyanobacterial community shifts the significance p 0 05 of the change points was tested by a combination of cumulative sum charts and bootstrapping techniques 1000 repetitions co occurrence networks have proved to be an effective approach for revealing the structure and function of phytoplankton communities cao et al 2020 escalas et al 2019 tse et al 2018 the co occurrence network analysis was carried out for the stages defined by the change points with the gephi v 0 9 2 bastian et al 2009 the nodes in the network plot represent the cyanobacterial taxa a spearman s correlation matrix was calculated and significant correlations r 0 6 and p 0 05 were considered to be valid for the co occurrence network and were shown as the edges between nodes in the network plot the fruchterman reingold placement algorithm was used for module detection and network visualization bastian et al 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 chronology and temporal changes in cyanobacteria community age depth model for the sediment core th19b based on the crs model indicated the upper 29 cm ranged from the 1933 to 2019 with an average sedimentation rate of 2 97 cm y fig 1 calculated ages beyond 29 cm would have large age uncertainties more than 34 years and were considered to be meaningless the 137cs activities of core th19b did not display a peak and the concentrations most samples were 5 bq kg 1 thus we considered the 137cs dates unreliable using high throughput sequencing of sedadna a total of 257 operational taxonomic units asvs associated with cyanobacteria were recovered from the dated sediment core and then grouped into 29 genera fig 3 we identified a clear pattern whereby the abundance of a potentially toxic cyanobacteria taxa microcystis progressively increased since the 1990s with a corresponding significant decrease of the previously dominant synechococcus fig 3 specifically the proportion of microcystis averaged approximately 7 of the total population until 1991 then from 1992 2009 increased rapidly to a mean relative abundance of approximately 19 following 2009 the proportion of toxin producing cyanobacteria fluctuated but overall remained high with a mean relative abundance of approximately 69 shifts in the entire cyanobacterial community were assessed using axis 1 scores of a nonmetric multi dimensional scaling nmds analysis which helped to identify points of change over time significant change points with a 95 confidence level were detected in 1991 1989 1995 and 2009 2009 2010 dividing the community level changes into three stages of cyanobacterial composition fig 4 the nmds plot based on the dissimilarities of cyanobacterial asvs clearly indicated strong differences among the three stages fig 4 stage i ca 1933 1991 is dominated by synechococcus 49 84 with a median value of 69 followed by dolichospermum formerly anabaena 1 21 with a median value of 3 9 nostoc 0 4 13 with a median value of 2 5 cyanobium 4 11 with a median value of 7 and phormidium 0 6 14 with a median value of 2 8 stage ii ca 1992 2009 is a transition stage where the relative abundance of synechococcus gradually decreases 16 69 with a median value of 42 with concurrent increases in phormidium 2 6 22 with a median value of 9 1 nostoc 0 5 25 with a median value of 6 2 dolichospermum 2 4 30 with a median value of 9 0 and the first notable occurrence of microcystis 6 5 55 with a median value of 6 6 stage iii ca 2010 2019 is marked by a sharp increase to dominance of microcystis 37 87 with a median value of 70 and concurrent decreases in synechococcus 4 32 with a median value of 10 9 nostoc 0 2 11 7 with a median value of 2 1 and dolichospermum 0 4 12 2 with a median value of 2 8 co occurrence network analysis was also used to reveal the differences between the three stages defined by the two change points in tahu table 1 and fig 5 the number of nodes of the resulting network was highest 29 during 1933 1991 which is consistent with the higher cyanobacterial diversity than the other stages meanwhile the average path length 2 25 during 1992 2009 was higher than those of the other two stages 1 66 and 1 implying more interactions between different species although with fewer nodes 24 the period during 2010 2019 displayed the highest network density 0 20 the highest number of edges 54 and the highest average node degree 4 50 suggesting that this stage was more complex than the others for the three stages significantly difference also existed in the keystone taxa fig 5 demonstrating remarkable changes in cyanobacterial structure and functioning furthermore the networks of the three stages differed in terms of proportion of negative links and the stage during 2010 2019 exhibited a higher value 26 than the other two stages 13 and 9 3 2 reconstructing long term cyanobacterial community changes using high throughput sequencing of sedadna high throughput sequencing of sedadna offered a taxonomically sensitive way to assess long term changes in cyanobacterial communities allowing us to extend the time span of cyanobacterial community changes from about thirty years based on identification of taxa in lakewater monitoring samples using traditional microscopy methods to about one century although post depositional dna preservation may possibly result in some biases in sedadna studies no obvious decreases in operational taxonomic units asvs of specific genera with increasing sediment age were detected suggesting that there was no apparent preferential dna degradation our sedadna results identified several cyanobacterial genera e g microcystis and dolichospermum which were also found in previous microscopic assessments of water quality monitoring data from lake taihu as well as some microalgae e g synechococcus that may not have been detected microscopically likely due to their small size chen et al 2003 deng et al 2019 this apparent discrepancy may be related to a bias against microalgae using the traditional light microscopic analysis monchamp et al 2016 in addition some biases may be generated with microscopic monitoring because the plankton identification can differ greatly from one investigator to another overall our results highlight the important role of high throughput sequencing of sedadna to obtain long term and high resolution information on cyanobacterial community structure and function 3 3 climate change as the driver of the increasing trend in potentially toxic cyanobacteria rapid economic development in asia over recent decades has led to a pronounced increase in anthropogenic aerosol emissions e g black carbon reducing incoming solar radiation through increased cloud albedo thereby attenuating the sea land thermal contrast and the intensity of monsoonal winds menon et al 2002 lake taihu located in the most economically developed region of china is experiencing both significant increases in regional air temperatures and reduced wind speeds meteorological observations recorded at the dongshan climate station near lake taihu since 1970 show that the mean annual wind speed has weakened by about 1 55 m s with a linear decreasing rate of 0 29 m s per decade r2 0 67 p 0 001 while the mean annual air temperature has increased by about 2 17 c with a linear increasing rate of 0 40 c per decade r2 0 89 p 0 001 although many cyanobacterial species have the potential to produce toxins huisman et al 2018 the toxic cyanobacterial blooms were mainly dominated by microcystis spp in lake taihu otten and paerl 2011 qin et al 2010 in our study the microcystis we recovered from sediment can be highly potential toxin producers significant positive correlations were identified between the increase in abundance of microcystis and increases in the mean annual air temperature of the dongshan meteorological station near lake taihu r 0 65 p 0 001 1956 2019 fig 6 a this upward warming trend over recent decades fig 7 f coincided with the increase in the proportion of microcystis and a corresponding decrease in picocyanobacteria including synechococcus fig 7b and cyanobium fig 3 the increasing proportion of microcystis fig 7b and declines in mean annual wind speed fig 7e were negatively correlated r 0 89 p 0 001 1956 2019 fig 6c in contrast no significant correlation was found between the abundance of microcystis and mean annual precipitation fig 6b nor with lakewater total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations fig 6d these trends likely indicate that n and p are in excess of algal demands throughout much of the year xu et al 2021 our results show that given the current high nutrient hypertrophic state of lake taihu climate change warming and weakened wind speed is now the key driver of the observed increasing abundance of microcystis elevated temperatures may favor microcystis in several ways increasing regional air temperatures accompanied by low wind speeds can encourage stable stratification of the water column and weaken vertical mixing promoting ideal conditions for the growth of highly buoyant surface bloom forming microcystis huisman et al 2004 jöhnk et al 2008 walsby 1994 although the growth rates of many cyanobacteria increase with higher temperatures microcystis is especially sensitive to temperature increases when compared to other cyanobacterial genera rigosi et al 2014 such as synechococcus in addition dense surface blooms are capable of strong light absorption that can increase the temperature of bloom areas by approximately 1 5 3 c compared to the surrounding surface waters kahru et al 1993 this positive feedback mechanism may further facilitate the dominance of microcystis these surface blooms can then shade non buoyant phytoplankton species thus suppressing their photosynthetic growth jöhnk et al 2008 the synechococcus as fast growing r strategy picocyanobacteria are sensitive to nutrient pulses and have been found to be more abundant in nutrient rich conditions scanlan and west 2002 zhang et al 2021 the growth of synechococcus exhibited larger sensitivity to nutrients than microcystis rigosi et al 2014 interestingly when the nutrients increased fast since 1980s in northern lake taihu the abundance of synechococcus decreased accompanied by an increase in microcystis this phenomenon suggests that even if the nutrient conditions are suitable for the growth of synechococcus the lack of buoyancy advantage in the competition with microcystis may lead to the decrease of the abundance of picocyanobacteria although lakewater tn and tp concentrations in the northern lake taihu were not correlated significantly with the abundance of microcystis during 1987 2018 fig 6d their pronounced increase in the 1990s was accompanied by accelerated eutrophication this suggests that in the early stages of microcystis expansion the impact of nutrient enrichment on cyanobacterial biomass and composition chen et al 2003 are important however over the last thirty years climatic factors rather than nutrient conditions are playing an increasingly important role in modulating changes in the cyanobacterial community in northern lake taihu for example after 1996 despite the implementation of a series of pollution management strategies that effectively reduced lakewater tn and tp concentrations fig 7d microcystis abundance continued to increase during this period of nutrient reductions the striking shift in cyanobacterial community composition was also reflected by an equally pronounced rise in chlorophyll a concentrations qin et al 2019 and an earlier start to the bloom period by up to 29 9 days since 2003 fig 7c shi et al 2019 these phytoplankton community trends including the clear disconnect between declining nutrients and increasing algal biomass agree with a response to regional warming and weakening wind speeds 3 4 the underestimation of climate change effects on potentially toxic cyanobacteria our results revealed that the increase of potentially toxic microcystis which we link mainly to recent climate change may weaken the stability of cyanobacterial communities and thus negatively impact the aquatic ecosystem based on co occurrence network analysis table 1 and fig 5 stage iii of lake taihu cyanobacteria composition ca 2010 2019 was characterized by the highest negative link values of the record indicating weak community stability and an increase in mutual exclusion between cyanobacterial taxa cao et al 2020 escalas et al 2019 lawes et al 2017 the majority of these negative links were correlated to increases in microcystis suggesting that the potentially toxic cyanobacteria are the main contributors to the community structure changes while previous studies have confirmed that climate change can lead to cyanobacterial bloom expansion our study demonstrates that warming and declining wind speeds can also increase the proportion of potentially toxin producing taxa in lake taihu the relative contribution of potentially toxic cyanobacteria to blooms after ca 2009 was approximately four times higher than before ca 1991 this suggests that recent climate changes have been significantly underestimated as drivers of the accelerated rate of potentially toxic cyanobacteria bloom formation whilst 30 years of water quality monitoring would be considered an exceptionally long data set by any international standard smol 2019 these data could not effectively distinguish the proportion of potentially toxin producing cyanobacterial taxa furthermore the initiation of the monitoring program post dates the onset of accelerated warming and industrialization and was therefore not of sufficient length to identify the relative roles of eutrophication and climate related variables sedadna affords the unique advantage of providing the requisite temporal context ca 100 years to distinguish between the relative contributions of nutrients and climate change to cyanobacterial bloom history as climate warming continues and wind speeds decline further the intensity and frequency of toxic algal blooms in lake taihu and elsewhere will likely increase despite effective nutrient abatement programs these findings further highlight that anthropogenic climate change is the new threat multiplier smol 2010 making it even more critical for lake managers to continue implementing effective nutrient control strategies particularly in lakes that continue to be affected by cultural eutrophication 4 conclusion we firstly reconstructed changes in cyanobacterial community based on sedadna data over the last century at lake taihu the third largest freshwater lake in china abrupt change of cyanobacterial communities occurred around two change points around 1991 and 2009 after each point cyanobacterial communities were progressively getting more complex and unstable evidenced by correlation based network analysis this cyanobacterial community shift may be linked to the progressively increasing of potentially toxic cyanobacteria taxa microcystis spp abundance since 1980s correlation analysis reveals that temperature and wind speed may be the main drivers of cyanobacterial community changes the general trend of warming and weakening winds in recent decades in lake taihu facilitated the growth of potentially toxic cyanobacterial taxa which could have counteracted the efforts of pollution control measures climate change contributed to the acceleration of potentially toxic cyanobacteria dominance in lake taihu during recent global warming toxic cyanobacteria blooms in eutrophic lakes may be more severe in the context of future warming seriously threating aquatic

detection system gwl 120 15 ametek usa the ages and sedimentation rates of core th119b were calculated using the constant rate of supply crs model appleby 2001 it is well recognized that sediment tn and tp concentrations are often unreliable as proxies of past nutrient concentrations and commonly do not reflect historical changes in lake trophic conditions ginn et al 2012 thus we only used lakewater quality monitoring data for tn and tp rather than from sediment geochemistry to track long term trends more reliably in nutrient conditions and for conducting statistical analysis with the dna data lakewater measurements of tn mg l and tp mg l that were collected from the northern part of lake taihu between 1987 and 2018 were synthesized from two studies dai et al 2016 wu et al 2019 fig 2 we used the composite nutrient curve for the northern part of the lake because the data for a specific point were not provided by the original literature dai et al 2016 the selected monitoring sites were mainly located in meiliang bay 2 2 meteorological data meteorological data collected from 1956 to 2019 including wind speed m s rainfall mm and temperature c from the nearby 3 km from lake taihu dongshan meteorological station 31 4 n 120 26 e were used for examining potential climatic drivers of cyanobacterial population changes these data were downloaded from the china meteorological data sharing service system https data cma cn additionally mean annual temperature data for the northern hemisphere morice et al 2021 from 1933 to 2019 were included for climatic drivers analysis 2 3 dna extraction amplification and high throughput sequence analysis for each interval in the upper 29 cm of core th19b lake sediment dna was extracted from 0 25 g wet sediment using a power soil dna isolation kit qiagen germany the extracted material was subsequently amplified using indexed algae specific primer pair p23srv f1 p23srv r1 sherwood and presting 2007 this primer set could provide better coverage of cyanobacterial community diversity than the 16s rdna primer set marcelino and verbruggen 2016 the domain v of the 23s rrna gene own universality which could cover most photosynthetic microbial groups presting 2006 sherwood and presting 2007 this primer set has also been widely used in previous studies related to cyanobacterial community e g hou et al 2014 marcelino and verbruggen 2016 presting 2006 sherwood and presting 2007 steven et al 2012 yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 one negative control was added in each batch 15 samples to prevent contamination during the dna extraction and during the polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification the pcr thermal profile was as follows 95 c 2 min 17 cycles with 0 5 c step down cycles from 66 to 58 c for 30 s and then annealing at 58 c for 30 s extension at 72 c for 30 s 18 cycles 94 c 30 s 58 c 30 s 72 c 30 s and final extension at 72 c for 5 min sherwood et al 2008 purified dna was pooled to be sequenced on the illumina hiseq platform illumina inc usa at the magigene company the raw sequencing data obtained were analyzed by a combination of usearch10 and r software providing effective sequences for clustering of amplicon sequence variants asvs based on unoise3 algorithm edgar 2016 and an abundant frequency threshold of 10 the taxonomic identification of representative asvs was done manually using the basic local alignment search tool blast with a similarity threshold of higher than 0 9 to compare with the cultured species in the ncbi database https blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi asvs that were assigned to phytoplankton were kept for subsequent analysis 2 4 statistical analysis nonmetric multi dimensional scaling nmds analysis was based on the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix using the vegan package for r change point analyzer taylor 2000 was used to identify periods of significant change in cyanobacterial community shifts the significance p 0 05 of the change points was tested by a combination of cumulative sum charts and bootstrapping techniques 1000 repetitions co occurrence networks have proved to be an effective approach for revealing the structure and function of phytoplankton communities cao et al 2020 escalas et al 2019 tse et al 2018 the co occurrence network analysis was carried out for the stages defined by the change points with the gephi v 0 9 2 bastian et al 2009 the nodes in the network plot represent the cyanobacterial taxa a spearman s correlation matrix was calculated and significant correlations r 0 6 and p 0 05 were considered to be valid for the co occurrence network and were shown as the edges between nodes in the network plot the fruchterman reingold placement algorithm was used for module detection and network visualization bastian et al 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 chronology and temporal changes in cyanobacteria community age depth model for the sediment core th19b based on the crs model indicated the upper 29 cm ranged from the 1933 to 2019 with an average sedimentation rate of 2 97 cm y fig 1 calculated ages beyond 29 cm would have large age uncertainties more than 34 years and were considered to be meaningless the 137cs activities of core th19b did not display a peak and the concentrations most samples were 5 bq kg 1 thus we considered the 137cs dates unreliable using high throughput sequencing of sedadna a total of 257 operational taxonomic units asvs associated with cyanobacteria were recovered from the dated sediment core and then grouped into 29 genera fig 3 we identified a clear pattern whereby the abundance of a potentially toxic cyanobacteria taxa microcystis progressively increased since the 1990s with a corresponding significant decrease of the previously dominant synechococcus fig 3 specifically the proportion of microcystis averaged approximately 7 of the total population until 1991 then from 1992 2009 increased rapidly to a mean relative abundance of approximately 19 following 2009 the proportion of toxin producing cyanobacteria fluctuated but overall remained high with a mean relative abundance of approximately 69 shifts in the entire cyanobacterial community were assessed using axis 1 scores of a nonmetric multi dimensional scaling nmds analysis which helped to identify points of change over time significant change points with a 95 confidence level were detected in 1991 1989 1995 and 2009 2009 2010 dividing the community level changes into three stages of cyanobacterial composition fig 4 the nmds plot based on the dissimilarities of cyanobacterial asvs clearly indicated strong differences among the three stages fig 4 stage i ca 1933 1991 is dominated by synechococcus 49 84 with a median value of 69 followed by dolichospermum formerly anabaena 1 21 with a median value of 3 9 nostoc 0 4 13 with a median value of 2 5 cyanobium 4 11 with a median value of 7 and phormidium 0 6 14 with a median value of 2 8 stage ii ca 1992 2009 is a transition stage where the relative abundance of synechococcus gradually decreases 16 69 with a median value of 42 with concurrent increases in phormidium 2 6 22 with a median value of 9 1 nostoc 0 5 25 with a median value of 6 2 dolichospermum 2 4 30 with a median value of 9 0 and the first notable occurrence of microcystis 6 5 55 with a median value of 6 6 stage iii ca 2010 2019 is marked by a sharp increase to dominance of microcystis 37 87 with a median value of 70 and concurrent decreases in synechococcus 4 32 with a median value of 10 9 nostoc 0 2 11 7 with a median value of 2 1 and dolichospermum 0 4 12 2 with a median value of 2 8 co occurrence network analysis was also used to reveal the differences between the three stages defined by the two change points in tahu table 1 and fig 5 the number of nodes of the resulting network was highest 29 during 1933 1991 which is consistent with the higher cyanobacterial diversity than the other stages meanwhile the average path length 2 25 during 1992 2009 was higher than those of the other two stages 1 66 and 1 implying more interactions between different species although with fewer nodes 24 the period during 2010 2019 displayed the highest network density 0 20 the highest number of edges 54 and the highest average node degree 4 50 suggesting that this stage was more complex than the others for the three stages significantly difference also existed in the keystone taxa fig 5 demonstrating remarkable changes in cyanobacterial structure and functioning furthermore the networks of the three stages differed in terms of proportion of negative links and the stage during 2010 2019 exhibited a higher value 26 than the other two stages 13 and 9 3 2 reconstructing long term cyanobacterial community changes using high throughput sequencing of sedadna high throughput sequencing of sedadna offered a taxonomically sensitive way to assess long term changes in cyanobacterial communities allowing us to extend the time span of cyanobacterial community changes from about thirty years based on identification of taxa in lakewater monitoring samples using traditional microscopy methods to about one century although post depositional dna preservation may possibly result in some biases in sedadna studies no obvious decreases in operational taxonomic units asvs of specific genera with increasing sediment age were detected suggesting that there was no apparent preferential dna degradation our sedadna results identified several cyanobacterial genera e g microcystis and dolichospermum which were also found in previous microscopic assessments of water quality monitoring data from lake taihu as well as some microalgae e g synechococcus that may not have been detected microscopically likely due to their small size chen et al 2003 deng et al 2019 this apparent discrepancy may be related to a bias against microalgae using the traditional light microscopic analysis monchamp et al 2016 in addition some biases may be generated with microscopic monitoring because the plankton identification can differ greatly from one investigator to another overall our results highlight the important role of high throughput sequencing of sedadna to obtain long term and high resolution information on cyanobacterial community structure and function 3 3 climate change as the driver of the increasing trend in potentially toxic cyanobacteria rapid economic development in asia over recent decades has led to a pronounced increase in anthropogenic aerosol emissions e g black carbon reducing incoming solar radiation through increased cloud albedo thereby attenuating the sea land thermal contrast and the intensity of monsoonal winds menon et al 2002 lake taihu located in the most economically developed region of china is experiencing both significant increases in regional air temperatures and reduced wind speeds meteorological observations recorded at the dongshan climate station near lake taihu since 1970 show that the mean annual wind speed has weakened by about 1 55 m s with a linear decreasing rate of 0 29 m s per decade r2 0 67 p 0 001 while the mean annual air temperature has increased by about 2 17 c with a linear increasing rate of 0 40 c per decade r2 0 89 p 0 001 although many cyanobacterial species have the potential to produce toxins huisman et al 2018 the toxic cyanobacterial blooms were mainly dominated by microcystis spp in lake taihu otten and paerl 2011 qin et al 2010 in our study the microcystis we recovered from sediment can be highly potential toxin producers significant positive correlations were identified between the increase in abundance of microcystis and increases in the mean annual air temperature of the dongshan meteorological station near lake taihu r 0 65 p 0 001 1956 2019 fig 6 a this upward warming trend over recent decades fig 7 f coincided with the increase in the proportion of microcystis and a corresponding decrease in picocyanobacteria including synechococcus fig 7b and cyanobium fig 3 the increasing proportion of microcystis fig 7b and declines in mean annual wind speed fig 7e were negatively correlated r 0 89 p 0 001 1956 2019 fig 6c in contrast no significant correlation was found between the abundance of microcystis and mean annual precipitation fig 6b nor with lakewater total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations fig 6d these trends likely indicate that n and p are in excess of algal demands throughout much of the year xu et al 2021 our results show that given the current high nutrient hypertrophic state of lake taihu climate change warming and weakened wind speed is now the key driver of the observed increasing abundance of microcystis elevated temperatures may favor microcystis in several ways increasing regional air temperatures accompanied by low wind speeds can encourage stable stratification of the water column and weaken vertical mixing promoting ideal conditions for the growth of highly buoyant surface bloom forming microcystis huisman et al 2004 jöhnk et al 2008 walsby 1994 although the growth rates of many cyanobacteria increase with higher temperatures microcystis is especially sensitive to temperature increases when compared to other cyanobacterial genera rigosi et al 2014 such as synechococcus in addition dense surface blooms are capable of strong light absorption that can increase the temperature of bloom areas by approximately 1 5 3 c compared to the surrounding surface waters kahru et al 1993 this positive feedback mechanism may further facilitate the dominance of microcystis these surface blooms can then shade non buoyant phytoplankton species thus suppressing their photosynthetic growth jöhnk et al 2008 the synechococcus as fast growing r strategy picocyanobacteria are sensitive to nutrient pulses and have been found to be more abundant in nutrient rich conditions scanlan and west 2002 zhang et al 2021 the growth of synechococcus exhibited larger sensitivity to nutrients than microcystis rigosi et al 2014 interestingly when the nutrients increased fast since 1980s in northern lake taihu the abundance of synechococcus decreased accompanied by an increase in microcystis this phenomenon suggests that even if the nutrient conditions are suitable for the growth of synechococcus the lack of buoyancy advantage in the competition with microcystis may lead to the decrease of the abundance of picocyanobacteria although lakewater tn and tp concentrations in the northern lake taihu were not correlated significantly with the abundance of microcystis during 1987 2018 fig 6d their pronounced increase in the 1990s was accompanied by accelerated eutrophication this suggests that in the early stages of microcystis expansion the impact of nutrient enrichment on cyanobacterial biomass and composition chen et al 2003 are important however over the last thirty years climatic factors rather than nutrient conditions are playing an increasingly important role in modulating changes in the cyanobacterial community in northern lake taihu for example after 1996 despite the implementation of a series of pollution management strategies that effectively reduced lakewater tn and tp concentrations fig 7d microcystis abundance continued to increase during this period of nutrient reductions the striking shift in cyanobacterial community composition was also reflected by an equally pronounced rise in chlorophyll a concentrations qin et al 2019 and an earlier start to the bloom period by up to 29 9 days since 2003 fig 7c shi et al 2019 these phytoplankton community trends including the clear disconnect between declining nutrients and increasing algal biomass agree with a response to regional warming and weakening wind speeds 3 4 the underestimation of climate change effects on potentially toxic cyanobacteria our results revealed that the increase of potentially toxic microcystis which we link mainly to recent climate change may weaken the stability of cyanobacterial communities and thus negatively impact the aquatic ecosystem based on co occurrence network analysis table 1 and fig 5 stage iii of lake taihu cyanobacteria composition ca 2010 2019 was characterized by the highest negative link values of the record indicating weak community stability and an increase in mutual exclusion between cyanobacterial taxa cao et al 2020 escalas et al 2019 lawes et al 2017 the majority of these negative links were correlated to increases in microcystis suggesting that the potentially toxic cyanobacteria are the main contributors to the community structure changes while previous studies have confirmed that climate change can lead to cyanobacterial bloom expansion our study demonstrates that warming and declining wind speeds can also increase the proportion of potentially toxin producing taxa in lake taihu the relative contribution of potentially toxic cyanobacteria to blooms after ca 2009 was approximately four times higher than before ca 1991 this suggests that recent climate changes have been significantly underestimated as drivers of the accelerated rate of potentially toxic cyanobacteria bloom formation whilst 30 years of water quality monitoring would be considered an exceptionally long data set by any international standard smol 2019 these data could not effectively distinguish the proportion of potentially toxin producing cyanobacterial taxa furthermore the initiation of the monitoring program post dates the onset of accelerated warming and industrialization and was therefore not of sufficient length to identify the relative roles of eutrophication and climate related variables sedadna affords the unique advantage of providing the requisite temporal context ca 100 years to distinguish between the relative contributions of nutrients and climate change to cyanobacterial bloom history as climate warming continues and wind speeds decline further the intensity and frequency of toxic algal blooms in lake taihu and elsewhere will likely increase despite effective nutrient abatement programs these findings further highlight that anthropogenic climate change is the new threat multiplier smol 2010 making it even more critical for lake managers to continue implementing effective nutrient control strategies particularly in lakes that continue to be affected by cultural eutrophication 4 conclusion we firstly reconstructed changes in cyanobacterial community based on sedadna data over the last century at lake taihu the third largest freshwater lake in china abrupt change of cyanobacterial communities occurred around two change points around 1991 and 2009 after each point cyanobacterial communities were progressively getting more complex and unstable evidenced by correlation based network analysis this cyanobacterial community shift may be linked to the progressively increasing of potentially toxic cyanobacteria taxa microcystis spp abundance since 1980s correlation analysis reveals that temperature and wind speed may be the main drivers of cyanobacterial community changes the general trend of warming and weakening winds in recent decades in lake taihu facilitated the growth of potentially toxic cyanobacterial taxa which could have counteracted the efforts of pollution control measures climate change contributed to the acceleration of potentially toxic cyanobacteria dominance in lake taihu during recent global warming toxic cyanobacteria blooms in eutrophic lakes may be more severe in the context of future warming seriously threating aquatic

15226,pesticide concentrations in surface water occasionally exceed regulated values due to seasonal events rainy season in high intensity agricultural areas or intermittent discharges leakage

quantities for the removal of four different pesticides each initial concentration 0 25 μg l from yangtze river water and in mitigating membrane fouling by an integrated flocculation sedimentation

instrumental characterizations chemical computations material flow analyses and statistical analyses efficient pesticide removal 80 3 94 3 and membrane fouling reduction 26 6 37 3 and 28 3 57 6 for reversible and irreversible membrane resistance respectively in the fsuf process were achieved by dosing hoc m whereas conventional inorganic coagulants were substantially inferior for pesticide removal 50 and displayed more severe fouling development hydrophobic association between the pesticides and the hydrophobic organic chain of hoc m played a predominant role in the improvement in pesticide removal coexisting particulate colloid inorganic minerals and natural organic matter with hoc m adsorbed on the surface acting as floc building materials provided sites for the indirect combination of pesticides into flocs the observed fouling alleviation from dosing hoc m was ascribed to both the pre removal of fouling causing materials in the flocculation sedimentation prior to uf and a stable hydrophilization modification effect of residual hoc m in the uf unit the latter effect resulted from a hydrophobic association between the pvdf substrate of the membranes and the hydrophobic organic chains of the hoc m causing the hydrophilic ends of the hoc m to be exposed away from the membrane surface thereby inhibiting foulant accumulation this work has not only demonstrated the superior performance of dosing hoc m in the fsuf process for trace pesticide removal in dwtps but also clarified the underlying mechanisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrophobic modified inorganic organic hybrid flocculant flocculation ultrafiltration pesticide fouling surface water treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction synthetic organic pesticides heavily used 5 9 million t a fao 2019 in modern agricultural practices for the elimination of pests weeds and plant pathogens have made large contributions to the un s sustainable development goal sdg 2 1 ending hunger bighiu et al 2020 un 2022 however a large fraction of the applied pesticides without achieving their purpose are lost by transport into adjacent surface water through drainage runoff etc jing et al 2021 riedo et al 2021 subsequently contaminating drinking water sources for humans and undermining efforts to achieve sdg 6 1 safe drinking water and 12 4 minimizing adverse impacts of chemicals on human health and the environment un 2022 while concentrations of pesticides are usually below regulated values they can occasionally exceed these due to seasonal e g up to tens of μg l in rainy season in high intensity agricultural areas or emergency variations such as leakage illegal discharge and other emergency events in surface water halbach et al 2021 schreiner et al 2021 and toxicological associations between these chemicals and adverse human health effects have been established navarro et al 2021 rickert et al 2020 since the removal of these recalcitrant low molecular weight micro pollutants by drinking water treatment plants dwtps is often variable and insufficient there is a continuing need to develop new approaches to efficiently remove pesticides from surface water and avoid compliance failure of the produced water castro gutierrez et al 2022 purnell et al 2020 the integrated process of flocculation sedimentation ultrafiltration fsuf is an established cost effective and practically convenient technology which has been shown to be effective for the removal of conventional pollutants e g suspended solids ss dissolved organic matter dom total phosphorus tp etc in many existing dwtps long et al 2021 prezelus et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 however the inadequate reduction of pesticide concentrations typically 40 limits the use of the current fsuf process for pesticide contaminated water purification as conventional flocculants cannot capture and incorporate soluble small molecular weight pesticide molecules into settleable flocs and the uf membranes are unable to retain pesticides with molecular weights lower than 1000 da xie et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 to overcome these deficiencies it is necessary to improve existing processes or develop add new ones as the requirement for pesticide removal is often seasonal the former option for dwtps already incorporating fsuf facilities involving the replacement of conventional flocculants with new superior chemicals is the most beneficial since it has the merits of not requiring additional land occupation or facility investment no formation of toxic by products controllable secondary pollution risk and good applicability to the variability of surface water quality demissie et al 2021 liu et al 2019 one type of relatively novel alternative flocculants hypothesized to have promise are hydrophobic modified flocculants synthesized by introducing hydrophobic organic components into a conventional flocculant matrix either organic or inorganic to enhance the adsorptive micellar flocculation amf function of flocculants by strengthening flocculant contaminant interactions demissie et al 2021 du et al 2018 liu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 in particular when hydrophobic organic segments are chemically bound with an inorganic matrix the obtained hybrid products have the advantage of both organic strong binding with organic groups on contaminants compact flocs with large size and inorganic constituents rapid nucleation through hydrolysis reduced overall cost and can be facilely prepared economically at large scale yang et al 2021 however the performance of such flocculants in effectively removing pesticides has not been reported to date specifically there is a lack of information about the feasibility of the above designed flocculants in terms of the different physicochemical characteristics chemical structure molecular weight hydrophobicity hydrophilicity pka etc of various pesticides fao 2019 and of the complicated interactions between the flocculants pesticides and coexisting contaminants that occur simultaneously it remains to be established whether the flocculants are effective for a wide spectrum of pesticides given the variation in their physico chemical nature for the established fsuf process in dwtps when the hydrophobic modified inorganic organic hybrid flocculants are used another important but uncertain issue is the potential influence on uf membrane fouling a principal concern in membrane based technology as the flocculants with desired contaminant removal performance may not be always suitable in combination with the uf stage tang et al 2020 the uncertainties lie in the following aspects although flocculation prior to membrane filtration has been reported to be beneficial in removing typical fouling causing substances shirakawa et al 2022 residual flocculants with specific properties and molecular cluster sizes reaching the uf stage may act as additional fouling causing materials werber et al 2016 in addition regarding the hydrophobic modified inorganic organic hybrid flocculants the organic and inorganic segments of the residual flocculants interact in different and complex ways with the uf membrane substrate and foulants which can possibly change the nature of the membrane for example surface hydrophobicity hydrophilicity exposed functional groups foulant layer properties etc resulting in unknown effects on fouling development su et al 2021 werber et al 2016 therefore a thorough investigation of the impact of dosing hydrophobic modified hybrid flocculants in the fsuf process on fouling development should be taken into consideration as well in the context of the foregoing the specific objectives of this work were to evaluate the performance of hydrophobic modified inorganic organic hybrid flocculants in the removal of a range of pesticides and the control of fouling in the fsuf process for the treatment of surface water sampled from the yangtze river compared to conventional flocculants and to reveal the relevant mechanisms of both water quality improvement and fouling control to that end novel hydrophobic organic chain n octadecyl modified metal al fe and ti hydroxide flocculants denoted as hoc m m al fe and ti respectively were prepared in large scale quantities 100 l where the organic and inorganic parts were chemically bound through a silane coupling agent structure and tested in comparison with commercial metal salt coagulants four pesticides namely metaldehyde met a molluscicide glyphosate gps a herbicide carbendazim cbz a fungicide and acetamiprid aap an insecticide were selected for the tests as representing a broad range of compounds and applications the findings of the evaluations were based on a combination of instrumental characterizations chemical computations material flow analyses using sankey diagrams van vuuren et al 2019 to illustrate the mass distribution of contaminants and flocculants at various stages which has not been employed in the fsuf process before and statistical analyses the results were expected to clarify the performance and mode of action of the hydrophobic modified inorganic organic hybrid flocculants in each unit stage of the fsuf process and provide practical guidance for dwtps to manage variations in pesticide concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1

according to jar test results the si figs s8 s9 for the removal of contaminants represented by conventional water quality parameters specifically turbidity uv254 doc tp and no3 n fig s8 the maximum res of turbidity and uv254 at corresponding optimal dosages ods were similarly high for all the flocculants whereas the maximum res of doc tp and no3 n in the hoc m systems were much greater than those in the metal chloride system compared to the notable downward trends with overdosed metal chlorides indicating the re stabilization of contaminants wang et al 2018 the res of conventional water quality parameters were much less sensitive to the excessive dosages of hoc m si fig s8 implying the wider flocculation window and greater tolerance for overdosing in the hoc m systems for the removal of pesticides si fig s9 maximum res of the three metal chlorides were low 40 agreeing with previously reported results campo et al 2013 by comparison hoc m had significantly greater maximum res for

inorganic coagulants in contaminant removal were more clearly revealed in the continuous fsuf tests fig 2 a c and si figs s10 and s11 the final treated water after uf had additional res of contaminants compared to the effluent from the sedimentation tank as contaminants incorporated in unsettled residual flocs were retained by the uf membranes yang et al 2020 as an example for discussion the comparative results for alcl3 and hoc al are shown in fig 2a c in addition to the slight improvement in the turbidity and uv254 removal hoc al demonstrated a notable and stable enhancement in the removal of other contaminants in particular the res of pesticides in the hoc al system 80 3 94 3 were twice as much as those in the alcl3 system demonstrating the broad spectrum pesticide removal capability of the inorganic organic hybrid flocculant among the three hoc m flocculants hoc al showed the best performance when hoc al was dosed the quality of the treated water after the whole fsuf process 0 26 0 05 ntu for turbidity 0 0143 0 0018 0 0237 0 0015 0 0413 0 0017 and 0 0493 0 0027 μg l for aap met cbz and gps respectively fully complied with the requirements of the chinese national standards for drinking water quality gb5749 2022 designated parametric limits 1 ntu for turbidity and 0 7 mg l for gps and the eu drinking water directive directive eu 2020 2184 designated parametric limits 1 0 ntu for turbidity 0 10 μg l for each pesticide and 0 50 μg l for total pesticides 3 1 2 effects of pesticide characteristics on pesticide removal despite the satisfactory removal of pesticides when the hybrid flocculants were used the res of the different pesticides varied for each of the hoc m systems the same sequence of res of the pesticides aap met cbz gps was found considering the reported influencing factors for the removal of nom by coagulation flocculation maqbool et al 2020 wang et al 2022 xu et al 2011 the above order of pesticide res was likely related to the pesticide characteristics such as the compound molecular weight species charge properties hydrophobicity hydrophilicity binding interactions with flocculants etc and these were subsequently analyzed in turn firstly the molecular weight sequence of pesticides aap cbz met gps was not consistent with the res sequence although it is commonly acknowledged that higher molecular weight nom are more easily removed in flocculation xu et al 2011 the molecular weights of the four pesticides all around 200 da in this work do not have significantly large differences in log units as those of typical nom compositions thus the molecular weight of pesticides was not a governing factor with regard to the species charge properties the four pesticides had varying charged species in the surface water at near neutral ph according to their species distribution ph curves si fig s1 neutral for met non dissociating and aap and anionic for cbz and gps there was no clear correlation between the pesticide species charge properties and their res although all the flocculants coagulants possessed a positive zp in stock solutions si fig s12 and the zp of unsettled flocs in the treated water increased with the increase of dosage of each flocculant coagulant si fig s13 it should be noted that zp always attained values much greater than zero at the ods for pesticide removal in addition hoc ti had a more positive zp value in stock solution si fig s12 but was less effective in pesticide removal than hoc al and hoc fe all these phenomena indicated that charge attraction was not the dominant effect for pesticide removal hydrophobicity hydrophilicity is another important characteristic of organic contaminants affecting their treatability the variation of res with log p of the pesticides are illustrated in fig 2d and the si fig s14 where log p is an indicator widely used to describe the relative hydrophobicity hydrophilicity of an organic compound the higher log p the more hydrophobic previously it has been reported that more hydrophobic nom was more readily flocculated yuan et al 2017 however this was not the case for the flocculation of the pesticides in this study fig 2d and si fig s14a specifically cbz having the largest log p value among the four pesticides had lower res than aap and met in all hoc m systems binding interactions between pesticides and flocculants including both the optimized complex configurations and corresponding bes are depicted in the si figs s15 s16 given the distinct natures of the inorganic and organic ends of the hybrid flocculants binding of pesticides to both ends of hoc m were computed according to the computed bes the variations of pesticide res with bes of pesticide flocculant complexes are illustrated in fig 2e g and in the si fig s14b d for each pesticide binding to the organic end long carbon chain of the hoc m via hydrophobic association had much larger bes than binding to the inorganic end metal hydroxides via h bonding implying that the pesticide molecules were more inclined to be bound to the organic end of the hoc m on the other hand for each hoc m the res of the pesticides displayed an upward trend with the increase of bes of complexes between pesticides and the organic end of the flocculant consequently interfacial hydrophobic association between the long organic chain of the hoc m and the pesticide molecule was identified to be the key factor determining the significant improvement in pesticide removal and the intrinsic reason for the aforementioned relative magnitude of res for the pesticides 3 1 3 effects of co existing contaminants on pesticide removal heterogeneous contaminants coexist in the raw water and their removal will be influenced by the presence of each other in the complex interactions during the flocculation process pearson correlation analysis of the res of different water quality parameters in the hoc m systems was thus performed and the associated correlation coefficients are shown in fig 2h and in the si fig s17 the res of different water quality parameters were found to be highly correlated with each other demonstrating that different co existing contaminants could be effectively removed simultaneously the main contributors of turbidity uv254 and doc in surface water are particulate colloid inorganic minerals and nom and these are usually recognized as the floc building materials ho et al 2022 contaminant size in raw water with and without pesticides the si fig s18 demonstrated that particles smaller than 100 nm in raw river water became larger after the addition of pesticides indicating the complexation of dom with pesticides however direct adsorption of pesticides onto dom contributed to a negligible proportion 2 of pesticide removal when no flocculant was dosed it was found from the dft calculation results given in the si fig s19 s22 using representative fragments of nom si fig s19 molecular weight of the fragment 608 da functional groups carbonyl carboxyl hydroxyl polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon saturated hydrocarbon groups etc model optimization method in the gaussian software m06 2x 6 31 g d that the hybrid flocculants could be more strongly adsorbed onto the inorganic minerals and nom preferentially via h bonding and hydrophobic association respectively considering the aforementioned key factor strong binding between the hybrid flocculants and pesticides particulate colloid inorganic minerals and nom with hoc m adsorbed provided locations for indirect combination of pesticides yielding beneficial effects for the incorporation of pesticides into flocs in a similar way small sized tp and no3 n could also be effectively removed at the same time in addition the preferred binding sites for tp and no3 n on hoc m the metal hydroxide end and the quaternary ammonium group respectively as shown in the si fig s22 were different from those of pesticides indicating that the two small molecular inorganic contaminants did not compete with pesticides in their removal 3 1 4 effects of hoc m characteristics on pesticide removal the three hoc m had slight differences in their res of pesticides where hoc al hoc fe hoc ti although direct binding of inorganic metal ends to pesticides was weaker than that of the organic end fig 2e 2g indirect binding between metal ends and pesticides contributed to a part of the pesticide removal as discussed in section 3 1 3 co existing particulate colloid inorganic minerals and nom with hoc m adsorbed promoted the removal of pesticides the inorganic segments of hoc m played a dominant role in the removal of particulate colloid contaminants duan and gregory 2003 gan et al 2021 as the inorganic salt coagulants are known to be effective in particle colloid removal for different hoc m the sequence of res turbidity was hoc al hoc fe hoc ti for inorganic salts the same metal sequence alcl3 fecl3 ticl4 was also found therefore the different characteristics of the inorganic ends of hoc m led to the differences in pesticide removal 3 1 5 residual flocculants considering the possible concerns about the secondary pollution risk of residual flocculants after water treatment tian et al 2020 the presence of residual flocculants represented by metal concentrations since chemical bonds between long organic chains and metal hydroxide were stable in the case of hoc m in the tests was examined as depicted in fig 2i residual metal concentrations in the metal chloride systems were much greater than the corresponding background values of the raw water 1 0 20 4 and 21 6 μg l for al fe and ti ions respectively by contrast residual metal concentrations in the effluent of both sedimentation and uf tanks in the hoc m systems were largely reduced the values were all below the regulated parametric limits in both the chinese standard gb5749 2022 0 2 mg l for al 0 3 mg l for fe and the european directive eu 2020 2184 0 2 mg l for both al and fe the achievement of such low metal ion residuals with hoc m was partially attributed to the better settling performance of flocs as aforementioned in section 3 2 in addition since all three hoc m flocculants had larger sizes than the uf membrane pores as shown in the inset figure of fig 2i the uf also contributed to the reduction of hoc m residual concentrations moreover given the inherent lower acute toxicity higher ec50 values using newborn daphnia magna as experimental organism of hoc m than the corresponding metal chlorides si fig s6 as described in section 2 1 the likelihood of the negative environmental risk of residual hoc m in the produced water was significantly decreased compared to commercial inorganic coagulants 3 2 floc sludge properties the floc sludge properties which are also important to the overall performance and economic costs of water treatment were determined methods in the si text s5 and evaluated according to the floc growth kinetics during the initial period after flocculant dosing si fig s23 flocs formed by hoc m grew faster than those formed by the conventional inorganic coagulants the final flocs withdrawn from the bottom of the sedimentation tank in the hoc m systems were significantly larger in size fig 3 a and si fig s24 and had a slightly larger d2 fractal value implying more compact flocs data obtained through linear fitting of log a log l as shown in si fig s25 than those in the inorganic coagulant systems representing better settling performance of flocs formed by the hybrid flocculants furthermore after mechanical compression dewatering the water contents of the hoc m based flocs were reduced to 60 wt whereas those of the inorganic coagulant based flocs were still greater than 80 wt on this basis the likely costs for dewatering and subsequent disposal of hoc m based flocs could be substantially reduced the improved dewatering properties of the flocs created by the hydrophobically modified flocculants were in agreement with other reported results zheng and taylor 2020 and could be attributed to the reduced surface energy arising from the hydrophobic organic chains gun ko et al 2005 zhang et al 2008 which gave rise to relatively higher water permeability with smaller sfr and cst as depicted in fig 3a sem images of the freeze dried flocs fig 3b also supported the improved dewatering properties of hoc m based flocs with larger cracks openings conducive to water release 3 3 uf membrane fouling control 3 3 1 fouling development the increase of tmp arising from the development of uf membrane fouling during the 40 day operation was monitored as displayed in fig 4 a b the tmp in the conventional inorganic coagulant systems increased much more rapidly reaching 17 22 kpa at day 40 than in the corresponding hoc m systems reaching 10 15 kpa at day 40 among different hoc m hoc al had the best performance in fouling mitigation with the lowest tmp at any time within the 40 days although sponge cleaning at the end of stages i and ii day 13 and 26 respectively could effectively reduce tmp by removing rev the tmp after the physical cleaning was greater than the corresponding initial value of each stage which was ascribed to the accumulation of strongly bound small sized foulants with sizes smaller than 30 nm in water after sedimentation as depicted in the si fig s26 in the membrane pores and caused irr kimura et al 2004 tu et al 2005 both rev and irr values relating to the end of the first two stages were then calculated fig 4c d compared to the corresponding values in the alcl3 system the best fouling control performance among the three inorganic coagulant systems in fig 4c the rev and irr decreased by 26 6 and 57 6 respectively in the hoc al system fig 4d the decline in the percentage of irr was more notable implying that the inhibition of irr by hoc al contributed to a major part of the fouling alleviation on one hand substances relating to dom tp and no3 n which would enter the membrane pores to cause irr were more efficiently removed by hoc al prior to uf as mentioned above fig 2a b on the other hand both the much larger sizes of hoc al than the uf pores inset figure of fig 2i and the much lower residual of hoc al than alcl3 after sedimentation fig 2i made it more difficult for the hybrid flocculant to enter and accumulate in the membrane pores both effects contributed to the substantially reduced irr in the hoc al system at the end of the entire fsuf operation hydrophobic organic components in the sludge of the uf tank in the hoc m systems accounted for a higher percentage compared to those in the metal salt systems the si fig s27 which was ascribed to the incorporation of hydrophobic organic chains of hoc m in addition foulant cake layers on the uf membranes in the metal chloride systems compared to those in hoc systems were thicker and denser fig 4e implying more severe fouling as depicted in the si fig s26 foulants with peaks larger than 30 nm in the uf feed water in metal salt systems were smaller compared to those in hoc m system and thus formed denser cake layers on the membranes after cake layers were removed by sponge cleaning the surface roughness of the used membranes was observed using afm compared to the pristine membrane all the used membranes had a rougher surface with a larger root mean square surface roughness value rq fig 4f hoc m systems had smaller rq values than metal salt systems and the rq in the hoc al system was the smallest the result verified that the best fouling reduction performance was that of hoc al 3 3 2 role of hoc m in fouling reduction the role of the hybrid flocculants and the reason why hoc m was superior to inorganic coagulants in fouling reduction was investigated further material flow which summarizes the path of the main materials during the 40 day fsuf operation was analyzed using sankey diagrams olatayo et al 2021 to visualize the dominant contributors to membrane fouling fig 5 a b and si fig s28 since the total concentrations of pesticides were much lower than those of the other background contaminants e g inorganic suspended solids iss and total organic carbon toc typically by 3 4 log units the effect of pesticide on fouling control was not considered here upstream of the uf tank compared to metal chlorides hoc m flocculants removed more contaminants comprising iss toc tp and no3 n which could act as fouling causing materials in the subsequent uf in both the flocculation and sedimentation steps this is one of the reasons for the enhanced fouling mitigation performance of hoc m as discussed above furthermore materials entering the uf tank were divided into three parts those settling in the sludge at the uf tank bottom those adhering to the membrane and those passing through the membrane into the permeate produced water as the materials on the membrane directly influence fouling the final tmp values in the different fsuf systems were correlated with the amount of each water quality parameter as demonstrated in fig 5c iss toc and tp on the membrane were strongly correlated with tmp with high r2 values 0 885 0 979 increased iss toc and tp led to tmp growth where the three contaminants were related to inorganic organic and bio fouling respectively by contrast the influence of no3 n on fouling was not statistically significant r2 of 0 420 in this work in addition the amount of flocculants coagulants on the membrane had a strong negative correlation with tmp indicating that flocculants coagulants on the membrane within the measured result range contributed to fouling reduction principal component pc analysis ma et al 2018 among tmp iss toc tp no3 n and flocculant content on the membrane shown in fig 5d provided additional information on the role of flocculants coagulants evidently pc1 was found to be the most statistically significant explaining 90 1 of the total variance major contributors for pc1 were flocculant coagulant amount tmp iss toc and tp among which flocculant coagulant amount on the left of fig 5d had a different behavior to the others on the right this result indicated that the accumulation of flocculants coagulants on the membrane could inhibit the accumulation of iss toc and tp and reduce the tmp as well according to the elemental composition of used membranes the si table s4 despite the much lower metal concentrations in the uf feed water in the hoc m systems than the metal salt systems fig 2i residual metal contents on the used membranes in the hoc m systems were higher implying the stronger binding interactions between hoc m and the membrane matrix moreover as depicted in fig 5e the used membranes after sponge cleaning at the end of the entire fsuf operation had lower contact angles in the hoc m systems than in the metal chloride system contact angles were nearly unchanged compared to the value of a pristine membrane here residual hoc m remaining on the membrane surface did not belong to the rev material because it could not be removed by the widely used physical cleaning sponge wiping method on the other hand the residual hoc m did not cause the increase of irr fig 4c 4d either since it produced a relatively stable hydrophilization modification effect on the membrane smaller contact angles a stable hydration layer was formed on the membrane surface which could inhibit the adhesion of foulants subsequently huang et al 2021 the magnitude of the contact angles of the used membranes had the sequence of hoc al hoc fe hoc ti indicating that the differences in the strength of the hydrophilization modification effect of hoc m led to the variations in fouling control performance binding configurations and energies between the characteristic segments of the coagulants flocculants and the pvdf matrix of the uf membrane were computed si fig s29 according to the summarized bes in fig 5f both the inorganic and organic ends of the hoc m possessed larger bes with the pvdf matrix compared to the inorganic coagulants hence the hoc m more readily adhered to the membrane for hoc m flocculants the organic end n octadecyl was more inclined to be bound with pvdf larger be via hydrophobic association than the inorganic ends in this way the hydrophilic inorganic ends were exposed outside making the membrane surface more hydrophilic 3 4 comprehensive evaluation of the performance of hoc m in the fsuf process based on the above discussion the results of the comprehensive evaluation of the hydrophobic modified inorganic organic hybrid flocculants can be summarized as follows 1 improved quality of the treated water the superior performance of hoc m over inorganic conventional coagulants was indicated by higher res for multiple contaminants trace pesticides tp and no3 n and to a less extent turbidity and uv254 a broader range of flocculant dose facilitating flocculant dosing control for rapidly changing raw water quality and reduced secondary pollution risks from the lower acute toxicity of the hybrid flocculants themselves and the reduced presence of residual flocculants in the final treated water 2 better floc sludge properties flocs sludge generated by hoc m were larger more compact and easier to dewater 3 reduced membrane fouling effects dosing hoc m in the fsuf dramatically reduced fouling development and in particular irr was largely decreased 4 potentially greater cost effectiveness preliminary calculations summarized in the si text s4 indicated that hoc al and hoc fe had similar material costs to commercial synthetic organic flocculants but were more expensive than the corresponding inorganic coagulants however when taking account of the cost savings in floc sludge treatment and uf membrane maintenance due to the improved floc properties and enhanced membrane fouling reduction as well as the enhanced pesticide removal during seasonal or emergency events without the need for additional advanced treatment units the overall economic cost of using hoc al and hoc fe may be substantially lower than conventional alternatives 4 conclusion efficient removal res up to 80 3 94 3 of four representative pesticides initial concentrations 0 25 μg l of each from real surface water and mitigation of membrane fouling rev and irr were reduced by 26 6 37 3 and 28 3 57 6 respectively in the fsuf process was achieved by dosing hoc m flocculants prepared in large scale quantities hydrophobic association between the pesticide molecules and the long organic chain of hoc m played a predominant role in their enhanced removal coexisting particulate colloid inorganic minerals and nom with hoc m adsorbed provided sites for the indirect incorporation of pesticide molecules into flocs and promoted pesticide removal improved fouling reduction resulted from both the efficient removal of fouling causing materials in the flocculation sedimentation prior to uf and a stable hydrophilization modification layer caused by residual hoc m on the membrane surface to sum up substantial benefits arising from the use of hoc al

15226,pesticide concentrations in surface water occasionally exceed regulated values due to seasonal events rainy season in high intensity agricultural areas or intermittent discharges leakage spillage or other emergency events the need to remove pesticide compounds in these situations poses a challenge for drinking water treatment plants dwtps in this work the performance of dosing hydrophobic modified inorganic organic hybrid flocculants hoc m lower acute toxicity than corresponding metal salt coagulants acceptable economic costs when m al or fe prepared in large scale quantities for the removal of four different pesticides each initial concentration 0 25 μg l from yangtze river water and in mitigating membrane fouling by an integrated flocculation sedimentation ultrafiltration fsuf process was evaluated over a period of 40 days the fsuf is well established in many dwtps the mechanisms underlying the treatment were unveiled by employing a combination of instrumental characterizations chemical computations material flow analyses and statistical analyses efficient pesticide removal 80 3 94 3 and membrane fouling reduction 26 6 37 3 and 28 3 57 6 for reversible and irreversible membrane resistance respectively in the fsuf process were achieved by dosing hoc m whereas conventional inorganic coagulants were substantially inferior for pesticide removal 50 and displayed more severe fouling development hydrophobic association between the pesticides and the hydrophobic organic chain of hoc m played a predominant role in the improvement in pesticide removal coexisting particulate colloid inorganic minerals and natural organic matter with hoc m adsorbed on the surface acting as floc building materials provided sites for the indirect combination of pesticides into flocs the observed fouling alleviation from dosing hoc m was ascribed to both the pre removal of fouling causing materials in the flocculation sedimentation prior to uf and a stable hydrophilization modification effect of residual hoc m in the uf unit the latter effect resulted from a hydrophobic association between the pvdf substrate of the membranes and the hydrophobic organic chains of the hoc m causing the hydrophilic ends of the hoc m to be exposed away from the membrane surface thereby inhibiting foulant accumulation this work has not only demonstrated the superior performance of dosing hoc m in the fsuf process for trace pesticide removal in dwtps but also clarified the underlying mechanisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract

introduction synthetic organic pesticides heavily used 5 9 million t a fao 2019 in modern agricultural practices for the elimination of pests weeds and plant pathogens have made large contributions to the un s sustainable development goal sdg 2 1 ending hunger bighiu et al 2020 un 2022 however a large fraction of the applied pesticides without achieving their purpose are lost by transport into adjacent surface water through drainage runoff etc jing et al 2021 riedo et al 2021 subsequently contaminating drinking water sources for humans and undermining efforts to achieve sdg 6 1 safe drinking water and 12 4 minimizing adverse impacts of chemicals on human health and the environment un 2022 while concentrations of pesticides are usually below regulated values they can occasionally exceed these due to seasonal e g up to tens of μg l in rainy season in high intensity agricultural areas or emergency variations such as leakage illegal discharge and other emergency events in surface water halbach et al 2021 schreiner et al 2021 and toxicological associations between these chemicals and adverse human health effects have been established navarro et al 2021 rickert et al 2020 since the removal of these recalcitrant low molecular weight micro pollutants by drinking water treatment plants dwtps is often variable and insufficient there is a continuing need to develop new approaches to efficiently remove pesticides from surface water and avoid compliance failure of the produced water castro gutierrez et al 2022 purnell et al 2020 the integrated process of flocculation sedimentation ultrafiltration fsuf is an established cost effective and practically convenient technology which has been shown to be effective for the removal of conventional pollutants e g suspended solids ss dissolved organic matter dom total phosphorus tp etc in many existing dwtps long et al 2021 prezelus et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 however the inadequate reduction of pesticide concentrations typically 40 limits the use of the current fsuf process for pesticide contaminated water purification as conventional flocculants cannot capture and incorporate soluble small molecular weight pesticide molecules into settleable flocs and the uf membranes are unable to retain pesticides with molecular weights lower than 1000 da xie et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 to overcome these deficiencies it is necessary to improve existing processes or develop add new ones as the requirement for pesticide removal is often seasonal the former option for dwtps already incorporating fsuf facilities involving the replacement of conventional flocculants with new superior chemicals is the most beneficial since it has the merits of not requiring additional land occupation or facility investment no formation of toxic by products controllable secondary pollution risk and good applicability to the variability of surface water quality demissie et al 2021 liu et al 2019 one type of relatively novel alternative flocculants hypothesized to have promise are hydrophobic modified flocculants synthesized by introducing hydrophobic organic components into a conventional flocculant matrix either organic or inorganic to enhance the adsorptive micellar flocculation amf function of flocculants by strengthening flocculant contaminant interactions demissie et al 2021 du et al 2018 liu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 in particular when hydrophobic organic segments are chemically bound with an inorganic matrix the obtained hybrid products have the advantage of both organic strong binding with organic groups on contaminants compact flocs with large size and inorganic constituents rapid nucleation through hydrolysis reduced overall cost and can be facilely prepared economically at large scale yang et al 2021 however the performance of such flocculants in effectively removing pesticides has not been reported to date specifically there is a lack of information about the feasibility of the above designed flocculants in terms of the different physicochemical characteristics chemical structure molecular weight hydrophobicity hydrophilicity pka etc of various pesticides fao 2019 and of the complicated interactions between the flocculants pesticides and coexisting contaminants that occur simultaneously it remains to be established whether the flocculants are effective for a wide spectrum of pesticides given the variation in their physico chemical nature for the established fsuf process in dwtps when the hydrophobic modified inorganic organic hybrid flocculants are used another important but uncertain issue is the potential influence on uf membrane fouling a principal concern in membrane based technology as the flocculants with desired contaminant removal performance may not be always suitable in combination with the uf stage tang et al 2020 the uncertainties lie in the following aspects although flocculation prior to membrane filtration has been reported to be beneficial in removing typical fouling causing substances shirakawa et al 2022 residual flocculants with specific properties and molecular cluster sizes reaching the uf stage may act as additional fouling causing materials werber et al 2016 in addition regarding the hydrophobic modified inorganic organic hybrid flocculants the organic and inorganic segments of the residual flocculants interact in different and complex ways with the uf membrane substrate and foulants which can possibly change the nature of the membrane for example surface hydrophobicity hydrophilicity exposed functional groups foulant layer properties etc resulting in unknown effects on fouling development su et al 2021 werber et al 2016 therefore a thorough investigation of the impact of dosing hydrophobic modified hybrid flocculants in the fsuf process on fouling development should be taken into consideration as well in the context of the foregoing the specific objectives of this work were to evaluate the performance of hydrophobic modified inorganic organic hybrid flocculants in the removal of a range of pesticides and the control of fouling in the fsuf process for the treatment of surface water sampled from the yangtze river compared to conventional flocculants and to reveal the relevant mechanisms of both water quality improvement and fouling control to that end novel hydrophobic organic chain n octadecyl modified metal al fe and ti hydroxide flocculants denoted as hoc m m al fe and ti respectively were prepared in large scale quantities 100 l where the organic and inorganic parts were chemically bound through a silane coupling agent structure and tested in comparison with commercial metal salt coagulants four pesticides namely metaldehyde met a molluscicide glyphosate gps a herbicide carbendazim cbz a fungicide and acetamiprid aap an insecticide were selected for the tests as representing a broad range of compounds and applications the findings of the evaluations were based on a combination of instrumental characterizations chemical computations material flow analyses using sankey diagrams van vuuren et al 2019 to illustrate the mass distribution of contaminants and flocculants at various stages which has not been employed in the fsuf process before and statistical analyses the results were expected to clarify the performance and mode of action of the hydrophobic modified inorganic organic hybrid flocculants in each unit stage of the fsuf process and provide practical guidance for dwtps to manage variations in pesticide concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials raw water was sampled from the nanjing section of the yangtze river one of the major rivers in china and an important surface water source for dwtps and stored at 4 c before use representative water quality parameters and images of the sampling site are shown in fig 1 a prior to the water treatment experiments the raw water samples were spiked with quantities of stock solutions of four pesticides to obtain an individual pesticide concentration of 0 25 μg l and then stirred at 200 rpm and 25 c for 24 h in order to reach equilibrium the pesticides aap met cbz and gps

acute toxicity of the hybrid flocculants material costs of the inorganic organic hybrid flocculants were calculated and are given in the si text s4 the costs of hoc al and hoc fe were comparable to those of commercial synthetic flocculants all other chemicals including metal chlorides used for performance comparison were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent nanjing jiangsu province china

previously reported method wang et al 2022 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality improvement 3 1 1 contaminant removal the optimized flocculant dosages used in the fsuf tests were determined according to jar test results the si figs s8 s9 for the removal of contaminants represented by conventional water quality parameters specifically turbidity uv254 doc tp and no3 n fig s8 the maximum res of turbidity and uv254 at corresponding optimal dosages ods were similarly high for all the flocculants whereas the maximum res of doc tp and no3 n in the hoc m systems were much greater than those in the metal chloride system compared to the notable downward trends with overdosed metal chlorides indicating the re stabilization of contaminants wang et al 2018 the res of conventional water quality parameters were much less sensitive to the excessive dosages of hoc m si fig s8 implying the wider flocculation window and greater tolerance for overdosing in the hoc m systems for the removal of pesticides si fig s9 maximum res of the three metal chlorides were low 40 agreeing with previously reported results campo et al 2013 by comparison hoc m had significantly greater maximum res for all four pesticides in jar tests among the three hoc m flocculants hoc al and hoc fe exhibited a better performance lower ods and higher res than hoc ti the advantages of hoc m over corresponding inorganic coagulants in contaminant removal were more clearly revealed in the continuous fsuf tests fig 2 a c and si figs s10 and s11 the final treated water after uf had additional res of contaminants compared to the effluent from the sedimentation tank as contaminants incorporated in unsettled residual flocs were retained by the uf membranes yang et al 2020 as an example for discussion the comparative results for alcl3 and hoc al are shown in fig 2a c in addition to the slight improvement in the turbidity and uv254 removal hoc al demonstrated a notable and stable enhancement in the removal of other contaminants in particular the res of pesticides in the hoc al system 80 3 94 3 were twice as much as those in the alcl3 system demonstrating the broad spectrum pesticide removal capability of the inorganic organic hybrid flocculant among the three hoc m flocculants hoc al showed the best performance when hoc al was dosed the quality of the treated water after the whole fsuf process 0 26 0 05 ntu for turbidity 0 0143 0 0018 0 0237 0 0015 0 0413 0 0017 and 0 0493 0 0027 μg l for aap met cbz and gps respectively fully complied with the requirements of the chinese national standards for drinking water quality gb5749 2022 designated parametric limits 1 ntu for turbidity and 0 7 mg l for gps and the eu drinking water directive directive eu 2020 2184 designated parametric limits 1 0 ntu for turbidity 0 10 μg l for each pesticide and 0 50 μg l for total pesticides 3 1 2 effects of pesticide characteristics on pesticide removal despite the satisfactory removal of pesticides when the hybrid flocculants were used the res of the different pesticides varied for each of the hoc m systems the same sequence of res of the pesticides aap met cbz gps was found considering the reported influencing factors for the removal of nom by coagulation flocculation maqbool et al 2020 wang et al 2022 xu et al 2011 the above order of pesticide res was likely related to the pesticide characteristics such as the compound molecular weight species charge properties hydrophobicity hydrophilicity binding interactions with flocculants etc and these were subsequently analyzed in turn firstly the molecular weight sequence of pesticides aap cbz met gps was not consistent with the res sequence although it is commonly acknowledged that higher molecular weight nom are more easily removed in flocculation xu et al 2011 the molecular weights of the four pesticides all around 200 da in this work do not have significantly large differences in log units as those of typical nom compositions thus the molecular weight of pesticides was not a governing factor with regard to the species charge properties the four pesticides had varying charged species in the surface water at near neutral ph according to their species distribution ph curves si fig s1 neutral for met non dissociating and aap and anionic for cbz and gps there was no clear correlation between the pesticide species charge properties and their res although all the flocculants coagulants possessed a positive zp in stock solutions si fig s12 and the zp of unsettled flocs in the treated water increased with the increase of dosage of each flocculant coagulant si fig s13 it should be noted that zp always attained values much greater than zero at the ods for pesticide removal in addition hoc ti had a more positive zp value in stock solution si fig s12 but was less effective in pesticide removal than hoc al and hoc fe all these phenomena indicated that charge attraction was not the dominant effect for pesticide removal hydrophobicity hydrophilicity is another important characteristic of organic contaminants affecting their treatability the variation of res with log p of the pesticides are illustrated in fig 2d and the si fig s14 where log p is an indicator widely used to describe the relative hydrophobicity hydrophilicity of an organic compound the higher log p the more hydrophobic previously it has been reported that more hydrophobic nom was more readily flocculated yuan et al 2017 however this was not the case for the flocculation of the pesticides in this study fig 2d and si fig s14a specifically cbz having the largest log p value among the four pesticides had lower res than aap and met in all hoc m systems binding interactions between pesticides and flocculants including both the optimized complex configurations and corresponding bes are depicted in the si figs s15 s16 given the distinct natures of the inorganic and organic ends of the hybrid flocculants binding of pesticides to both ends of hoc m were computed according to the computed bes the variations of pesticide res with bes of pesticide flocculant complexes are illustrated in fig 2e g and in the si fig s14b d for each pesticide binding to the organic end long carbon chain of the hoc m via hydrophobic association had much larger bes than binding to the inorganic end metal hydroxides via h bonding implying that the pesticide molecules were more inclined to be bound to the organic end of the hoc m on the other hand for each hoc m the res of the pesticides displayed an upward trend with the increase of bes of complexes between pesticides and the organic end of the flocculant consequently interfacial hydrophobic association between the long organic chain of the hoc m and the pesticide molecule was identified to be the key factor determining the significant improvement in pesticide removal and the intrinsic reason for the aforementioned relative magnitude of res for the pesticides 3 1 3 effects of co existing contaminants on pesticide removal heterogeneous contaminants coexist in the raw water and their removal will be influenced by the presence of each other in the complex interactions during the flocculation process pearson correlation analysis of the res of different water quality parameters in the hoc m systems was thus performed and the associated correlation coefficients are shown in fig 2h and in the si fig s17 the res of different water quality parameters were found to be highly correlated with each other demonstrating that different co existing contaminants could be effectively removed simultaneously the main contributors of turbidity uv254 and doc in surface water are particulate colloid inorganic minerals and nom and these are usually recognized as the floc building materials ho et al 2022 contaminant size in raw water with and without pesticides the si fig s18 demonstrated that particles smaller than 100 nm in raw river water became larger after the addition of pesticides indicating the complexation of dom with pesticides however direct adsorption of pesticides onto dom contributed to a negligible proportion 2 of pesticide removal when no flocculant was dosed it was found from the dft calculation results given in the si fig s19 s22 using representative fragments of nom si fig s19 molecular weight of the fragment 608 da functional groups carbonyl carboxyl hydroxyl polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon saturated hydrocarbon groups etc model optimization method in the gaussian software m06 2x 6 31 g d that the hybrid flocculants could be more strongly adsorbed onto the inorganic minerals and nom preferentially via h bonding and hydrophobic association respectively considering the aforementioned key factor strong binding between the hybrid flocculants and pesticides particulate colloid inorganic minerals and nom with hoc m adsorbed provided locations for indirect combination of pesticides yielding beneficial effects for the incorporation of pesticides into flocs in a similar way small sized tp and no3 n could also be effectively removed at the same time in addition the preferred binding sites for tp and no3 n on hoc m the metal hydroxide end and the quaternary ammonium group respectively as shown in the si fig s22 were different from those of pesticides indicating that the two small molecular inorganic contaminants did not compete with pesticides in their removal 3 1 4 effects of hoc m characteristics on pesticide removal the three hoc m had slight differences in their res of pesticides where hoc al hoc fe hoc ti although direct binding of inorganic metal ends to pesticides was weaker than that of the organic end fig 2e 2g indirect binding between metal ends and pesticides contributed to a part of the pesticide removal as discussed in section 3 1 3 co existing particulate colloid inorganic minerals and nom with hoc m adsorbed promoted the removal of pesticides the inorganic segments of hoc m played a dominant role in the removal of particulate colloid contaminants duan and gregory 2003 gan et al 2021 as the inorganic salt coagulants are known to be effective in particle colloid removal for different hoc m the sequence of res turbidity was hoc al hoc fe hoc ti for inorganic salts the same metal sequence alcl3 fecl3 ticl4 was also found therefore the different characteristics of the inorganic ends of hoc m led to the differences in pesticide removal 3 1 5 residual flocculants considering the possible concerns about the secondary pollution risk of residual flocculants after water treatment tian et al 2020 the presence of residual flocculants represented by metal concentrations since chemical bonds between long organic chains and metal hydroxide were stable in the case of hoc m in the tests was examined as depicted in fig 2i residual metal concentrations in the metal chloride systems were much greater than the corresponding background values of the raw water 1 0 20 4 and 21 6 μg l for al fe and ti ions respectively by contrast residual metal concentrations in the effluent of both sedimentation and uf tanks in the hoc m systems were largely reduced the values were all below the regulated parametric limits in both the chinese standard gb5749 2022 0 2 mg l for al 0 3 mg l for fe and the european directive eu 2020 2184 0 2 mg l for both al and fe the achievement of such low metal ion residuals with hoc m was partially attributed to the better settling performance of flocs as aforementioned in section 3 2 in addition since all three hoc m flocculants had larger sizes than the uf membrane pores as shown in the inset figure of fig 2i the uf also contributed to the reduction of hoc m residual concentrations moreover given the inherent lower acute toxicity higher ec50 values using newborn daphnia magna as experimental organism of hoc m than the corresponding metal chlorides si fig s6 as described in section 2 1 the likelihood of the negative environmental risk of residual hoc m in the produced water was significantly decreased compared to commercial inorganic coagulants 3 2 floc sludge properties the floc sludge properties which are also important to the overall performance and economic costs of water treatment were determined methods in the si text s5 and evaluated according to the floc growth kinetics during the initial period after flocculant dosing si fig s23 flocs formed by hoc m grew faster than those formed by the conventional inorganic coagulants the final flocs withdrawn from the bottom of the sedimentation tank in the hoc m systems were significantly larger in size fig 3 a and si fig s24 and had a slightly larger d2 fractal value implying more compact flocs data obtained through linear fitting of log a log l as shown in si fig s25 than those in the inorganic coagulant systems representing better settling performance of flocs formed by the hybrid flocculants furthermore after mechanical compression dewatering the water contents of the hoc m based flocs were reduced to 60 wt whereas those of the inorganic coagulant based flocs were still greater than 80 wt on this basis the likely costs for dewatering and subsequent disposal of hoc m based flocs could be substantially reduced the improved dewatering properties of the flocs created by the hydrophobically modified flocculants were in agreement with other reported results zheng and taylor 2020 and could be attributed to the reduced surface energy arising from the hydrophobic organic chains gun ko et al 2005 zhang et al 2008 which gave rise to relatively higher water permeability with smaller sfr and cst as depicted in fig 3a sem images of the freeze dried flocs fig 3b also supported the improved dewatering properties of hoc m based flocs with larger cracks openings conducive to water release 3 3 uf membrane fouling control 3 3 1 fouling development the increase of tmp arising from the development of uf membrane fouling during the 40 day operation was monitored as displayed in fig 4 a b the tmp in the conventional inorganic coagulant systems increased much more rapidly reaching 17 22 kpa at day 40 than in the corresponding hoc m systems reaching 10 15 kpa at day 40 among different hoc m hoc al had the best performance in fouling mitigation with the lowest tmp at any time within the 40 days although sponge cleaning at the end of stages i and ii day 13 and 26 respectively could effectively reduce tmp by removing rev the tmp after the physical cleaning was greater than the corresponding initial value of each stage which was ascribed to the accumulation of strongly bound small sized foulants with sizes smaller than 30 nm in water after sedimentation as depicted in the si fig s26 in the membrane pores and caused irr kimura et al 2004 tu et al 2005 both rev and irr values relating to the end of the first two stages were then calculated fig 4c d compared to the corresponding values in the alcl3 system the best fouling control performance among the three inorganic coagulant systems in fig 4c the rev and irr decreased by 26 6 and 57 6 respectively in the hoc al system fig 4d the decline in the percentage of irr was more notable implying that the inhibition of irr by hoc al contributed to a major part of the fouling alleviation on one hand substances relating to dom tp and no3 n which would enter the membrane pores to cause irr were more efficiently removed by hoc al prior to uf as mentioned above fig 2a b on the other hand both the much larger sizes of hoc al than the uf pores inset figure of fig 2i and the much lower residual of hoc al than alcl3 after sedimentation fig 2i made it more difficult for the hybrid flocculant to enter and accumulate in the membrane pores both effects contributed to the substantially reduced irr in the hoc al system at the end of the entire fsuf operation hydrophobic organic components in the sludge of the uf tank in the hoc m systems accounted for a higher percentage compared to those in the metal salt systems the si fig s27 which was ascribed to the incorporation of hydrophobic organic chains of hoc m in addition foulant cake layers on the uf membranes in the metal chloride systems compared to those in hoc systems were thicker and denser fig 4e implying more severe fouling as depicted in the si fig s26 foulants with peaks larger than 30 nm in the uf feed water in metal salt systems were smaller compared to those in hoc m system and thus formed denser cake layers on the membranes after cake layers were removed by sponge cleaning the surface roughness of the used membranes was observed using afm compared to the pristine membrane all the used membranes had a rougher surface with a larger root mean square surface roughness value rq fig 4f hoc m systems had smaller rq values than metal salt systems and the rq in the hoc al system was the smallest the result verified that the best fouling reduction performance was that of hoc al 3 3 2 role of hoc m in fouling reduction the role of the hybrid flocculants and the reason why hoc m was superior to inorganic coagulants in fouling reduction was investigated further material flow which summarizes the path of the main materials during the 40 day fsuf operation was analyzed using sankey diagrams olatayo et al 2021 to visualize the dominant contributors to membrane fouling fig 5 a b and si fig s28 since the total concentrations of pesticides were much lower than those of the other background contaminants e g inorganic suspended solids iss and total organic carbon toc typically by 3 4 log units the effect of pesticide on fouling control was not considered here upstream of the uf tank compared to metal chlorides hoc m flocculants removed more contaminants comprising iss toc tp and no3 n which could act as fouling causing materials in the subsequent uf in both the flocculation and sedimentation steps this is one of the reasons for the enhanced fouling mitigation performance of hoc m as discussed above furthermore materials entering the uf tank were divided into three parts those settling in the sludge at the uf tank bottom those adhering to the membrane and those passing through the membrane into the permeate produced water as the materials on the membrane directly influence fouling the final tmp values in the different fsuf systems were correlated with the amount of each water quality parameter as demonstrated in fig 5c iss toc and tp on the membrane were strongly correlated with tmp with high r2 values 0 885 0 979 increased iss toc and tp led to tmp growth where the three contaminants were related to inorganic organic and bio fouling respectively by contrast the influence of no3 n on fouling was not statistically significant r2 of 0 420 in this work in addition the amount of flocculants coagulants on the membrane had a strong negative correlation with tmp indicating that flocculants coagulants on the membrane within the measured result range contributed to fouling reduction principal component pc analysis ma et al 2018 among tmp iss toc tp no3 n and flocculant content on the membrane shown in fig 5d provided additional information on the role of flocculants coagulants evidently pc1 was found to be the most statistically significant explaining 90 1 of the total variance major contributors for pc1 were flocculant coagulant amount tmp iss toc and tp among which flocculant coagulant amount on the left of fig 5d had a different behavior to the others on the right this result indicated that the accumulation of flocculants coagulants on the membrane could inhibit the accumulation of iss toc and tp and reduce the tmp as well according to the elemental composition of used membranes the si table s4 despite the much lower metal concentrations in the uf feed water in the hoc m systems than the metal salt systems fig 2i residual metal contents on the used membranes in the hoc m systems were higher implying the stronger binding interactions between hoc m and the membrane matrix moreover as depicted in fig 5e the used membranes after sponge cleaning at the end of the entire fsuf operation had lower contact angles in the hoc m systems than in the metal chloride system contact angles were nearly unchanged compared to the value of a pristine membrane here residual hoc m remaining on the membrane surface did not belong to the rev material because it could not be removed by the widely used physical cleaning sponge wiping method on the other hand the residual hoc m did not cause the increase of irr fig 4c 4d either since it produced a relatively stable hydrophilization modification effect on the membrane smaller contact angles a stable hydration layer was formed on the membrane surface which could inhibit the adhesion of foulants subsequently huang et al 2021 the magnitude of the contact angles of the used membranes had the sequence of hoc al hoc fe hoc ti indicating that the differences in the strength of the hydrophilization modification effect of hoc m led to the variations in fouling control performance binding configurations and energies between the characteristic segments of the coagulants flocculants and the pvdf matrix of the uf membrane were computed si fig s29 according to the summarized bes in fig 5f both the inorganic and organic ends of the hoc m possessed larger bes with the pvdf matrix compared to the inorganic coagulants hence the hoc m more readily adhered to the membrane for hoc m flocculants the organic end n octadecyl was more inclined to be bound with pvdf larger be via hydrophobic association than the inorganic ends in this way the hydrophilic inorganic ends were exposed outside making the membrane surface more hydrophilic 3 4 comprehensive evaluation of the performance of hoc m in the fsuf process based on the above discussion the results of the comprehensive evaluation of the hydrophobic modified inorganic organic hybrid flocculants can be summarized as follows 1 improved quality of the treated water the superior performance of hoc m over inorganic conventional coagulants was indicated by higher res for multiple contaminants trace pesticides tp and no3 n and to a less extent turbidity and uv254 a broader range of flocculant dose facilitating flocculant dosing control for rapidly changing raw water quality and reduced secondary pollution risks from the lower acute toxicity of the hybrid flocculants themselves and the reduced presence of residual flocculants in the final treated water 2 better floc sludge properties flocs sludge generated by hoc m were larger more compact and easier to dewater 3 reduced membrane fouling effects dosing hoc m in the fsuf dramatically reduced fouling development and in particular irr was largely decreased 4 potentially greater cost effectiveness preliminary calculations summarized in the si text s4 indicated that hoc al and hoc fe had similar material costs to commercial synthetic organic flocculants but were more expensive than the corresponding inorganic coagulants however when taking account of the cost savings in floc sludge treatment and uf membrane maintenance due to the improved floc properties and enhanced membrane fouling reduction as well as the enhanced pesticide removal during seasonal or emergency events without the need for additional advanced treatment units the overall economic cost of using hoc al and hoc fe may be substantially lower than conventional alternatives 4 conclusion efficient removal res up to 80 3 94 3 of four representative pesticides initial concentrations 0 25 μg l of each from real surface water and mitigation of membrane fouling rev and irr were reduced by 26 6 37 3 and 28 3 57 6 respectively in the fsuf process was achieved by dosing hoc m flocculants prepared in large scale quantities hydrophobic association between the pesticide molecules and the long organic chain of hoc m played a predominant role in their enhanced removal coexisting particulate colloid inorganic minerals and nom with hoc m adsorbed provided sites for the indirect incorporation of pesticide molecules into flocs and promoted pesticide removal improved fouling reduction resulted from both the efficient removal of fouling causing materials in the flocculation sedimentation prior to uf and a stable hydrophilization modification layer caused by residual hoc m on the membrane surface to sum up substantial benefits arising from the use of hoc al

15227,lakes are hotspots for global carbon cycling yet few studies have explored how rainstorms alter the flux composition and bio lability of dissolved organic matter dom in inflowing rivers using high frequency monitoring we conducted extensive campaigns in the watershed of lake taihu and made daily observations for three years in its two largest inflowing tributaries river dapu and river yincun we found higher doc bio labile doc bdoc and specific uv absorbance suva254 levels in the northwestern inflowing regions compared with the remaining lake regions doc and bdoc increased during rainstorms in river dapu and doc declined due to local dilution and bdoc increased during rainstorms in river yincun we found that rainstorms resulted in increased dom absorbance a 350 suva254 and humification index hix and enhanced percentages of humic like fluorescent components polycyclic condensed aromatic and polyphenolic compounds as revealed from ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry ft icr ms while spectral slope s 275 295 and the percentages of protein like c1 and c3 declined during rainstorms compared with other seasons this can be explained by a combined flushing of catchment soil organic matter and household effluents the annual inflows of doc and bdoc to lake taihu were 1 15 0 18 104 t c yr 1 and 0 23 0 06 104 t c yr 1 from river dapu and 2 92 0 42 103 t c yr 1 and 0 53 0 07 103 t c yr 1 from river yincun respectively and the fluxes of doc and bdoc from both rivers increased during rainstorms we found an elevated frequency of heavy rainfall and rainstorms in the lake watershed during the past six decades we conclude that an elevated input of terrestrial organic rich dom with concurrent high aromaticity and high bio lability from inflowing rivers is likely to occur

outgassed as co2 drake et al 2018 dissolved organic matter dom in fluvial environments are primarily derived from leaching of soil organic matter and flushing of organic substances from impervious land cover in terrestrial landscapes hosen et al 2014 zhou et al 2022 the quantity timing and chemical composition of dom exported to rivers and downstream linked lakes are largely constrained by land use topography and hydrology drake et al 2019 johnston et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 lakes and reservoirs are typically the most important sources of water for large and mega cities lake dom is of special concern for drinking water treatment as dom may interfere with the drinking water treatment processes and is expensive to remove baghoth et al 2011 tomlinson et al 2016 dom can be responsible for unpleasant odor and taste formation of carcinogenic disinfection by products and toxicity and bio availability of micropollutants stedmon et al 2011 kothawala et al 2017 the reactivity and fate of dom are closely associated with its chemical composition kellerman et al 2015 and the hydrological connectivity of upstream landscapes largely controls the chemical composition of dom in the downstream receiving waters lynch et al 2019 johnston et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 traditional approaches for quantifying riverine carbon fluxes often rely on periodical sampling at weekly monthly or even seasonal temporal resolution but this often fails to capture the biogeochemical changes in dom composition during episodical storm events hur et al 2014 spencer et al 2016 rainstorm events are a major driver that pulses the export of terrestrial dom and carbon bound nutrients into streams rivers and downstream linked lake ecosystems rainfall has been shown to be responsible for 86 of the annual dissolved organic carbon doc export with large rainfalls contributing to 57 of the doc exported in 30 small forested watersheds in the eastern usa raymond and saiers 2010 an extreme five day rainstorm event during the passage of hurricane irene resulted in the export of 43 of the annual doc and 31 of the annual dissolved organic nitrogen fluxes in esopus creek in new york yoon and raymond 2012 despite the importance of rainstorm events in influencing the export of doc only a few studies to date have explored the doc flux during rainstorm events yoon and raymond 2012 zhou et al 2020 long term high frequency field observations especially campaigns conducted during the occurrence of rainstorm events can help elaborate advanced management schemes for large lakes zhou et al 2020 however it remains unclear how rainstorms alter the flux chemical composition and bio lability of dom exported to large eutrophic lakes a recent study carried out in a mountainous valley in southern china indicated that the occurrence and intensity of heavy rainfall with rainfall intensity 25 mm d 1 and rainstorms with rainfall intensity 50 mm d 1 have increased during the past six decades zhou et al 2020 other recent studies conducted in the lake taihu watershed indicate that the net discharge of inflowing stream water is more relevant to dom composition than catchment area with urban land use or population density zhou et al 2018a zhou et al 2018b it remains unclear to what extent the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall and rainstorm events will increase specifically in the yangtze river delta which is one of the most developed regions in china it is also unclear if rainstorms will pulse the export of terrestrial dom and nutrients to lakes fueling further eutrophication of these waters the aim of this study is to quantify how rainstorm events impact the flux chemical composition and bio lability of dom exported to large shallow and hyper eutrophic lake taihu via its major inflowing tributaries we carried out an extensive field sampling campaign across the lake n 35 and its surrounding rivers n 209 during the wet to dry transition season and took daily measurements at the two largest inflowing tributaries river dapu and river yincun for almost three year from january 1 2019 to december 8 2021 n 1 073 we hypothesized that during extreme rainstorm events the mobilization of soil organic matter and flushing of non point source dom over impervious landscapes in densely populated areas would result in elevated export of both aromatic soil organic matter and aliphatic energy rich dom contributing to higher bio lability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lake taihu is the third largest freshwater lake in china it is located in the yangtze

estimated that during rainstorms the doc flux ranged from 34 0 to 62 3 t d 1 and the bdoc flux from 10 3 to 25 5 t d 1 in river dapu while the doc flux ranged from 11 3 to 18 2 t d 1 and the bdoc flux from 3 1 to 4 6 t d 1 in river yincun being much higher during rainstorms than in the low water periods 3 3 relationships between water level and dom related indices in river dapu and river yincun

analysis pca results we used principal component analysis pca to investigate the impacts of rainstorms on the chemical composition of dom samples taken from river dapu and river yincun as for the river dapu samples the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 explained 68 3 and 10 6 respectively of all the variables included fig 6 in comparison for the samples collected from river yincun pc1 and pc2 explained 68 5 and 11 1 respectively for both rivers we found that s 275 295 c1 and c3 showed positive pc1 loadings whereas the daily water level a 350 suva254 hix c2 and c4 exhibited negative loadings fig 6 s 275 295 is typically negatively associated with the terrestrial input of dom i e increasing aromaticity helms et al 2008 c1 and c3 can be categorized into protein like components and suva254 and hix are positively associated with the aromaticity of dom implying that pc1 was negatively associated with the relative contribution of terrestrial aromatic dom and positively with the autochthonous production of protein like substances we found that pc1 scores decreased significantly with the increasing water levels in both rivers p 0 0001 fig 6 3 6 ft icr ms results from river dapu at contrasting water levels the mean ratio of mass to charge m z was lower mean m z 349 3 for the samples collected in the low water level season of river dapu 3 55 m than in the high water level season 5 05 m with a mean m z 363 3 fig 7 a in general there was an enrichment of formulae with lower h c 1 5 during high water level period fig 7b meanwhile the relative abundance weight contributions ra of polycyclic and condensed aromatic and polyphenolic compounds increased during high discharge events corresponding to depleted ra of the highly unsaturated and phenolic and aliphatic compounds fig 7b table s1 spearman s rank order correlation analysis revealed that the relative abundance of polycyclic and condensed aromatic and polyphenolic compounds increased with an increasing percentage of terrestrial humic like c2 and water level rho 0 5 p 0 05 while the relative abundance of the highly unsaturated and phenolic and aliphatic compounds decreased with an increasing percentage of terrestrial humic like c2 and water level rho 0 5 p 0 05 fig 7c d the percentage of terrestrial humic like c2 increased while the ra of h c ratio of dom decreased significantly with increasing water levels fig 7e f table s1 3 7 long term 1959 2021 trends of heavy rain and rainstorm events according to the historical rainfall monitoring data 1959 2021 of the meteorological gauging stations of dongshan wuxi yixing and huzhou surrounding lake taihu an occurrence frequencies of both heavy rainfall 25 mm d 1 and rainstorm 50 mm d 1 events were recorded fig 8 enhanced intensity of heavy rainfall events but not of rainstorm events was recorded from 1959 to 2021 based on the simple linear regression models we observed that the frequency of heavy rainfall increased from 11 times per year in 1959 to 14 times per year in 2021 and rainstorm events increased from twice per year in 1959 to 3 times per year in 2021 fig 8 the mean intensity of heavy rainfall in the lake catchment increased from 34 0 3 7 mm d 1 in 1959 to 41 2 1 4 mm d 1 in 2021 fig 8 4 discussion our extensive spatial and temporal sampling program coupled with long term high frequency field observations revealed that compared with low water seasons rainstorm events resulted in increased doc and bdoc levels and thereby rapid flushing and export of freshly mobilized terrestrial dom with high bio lability and concurrent high aromaticity to lake taihu via its two major inflowing tributaries the chemical composition of dom in lake taihu was strongly influenced by the mobilization of terrestrial soil organic matter and non point source effluents from the northwestern inflowing huxi sub watershed firstly we found high levels of doc in the northwestern inflowing huxi sub watershed and the northwestern lake regions coinciding with the high levels of suva254 and bdoc recorded here compared with the remaining sub watersheds and also the remaining lake regions fig 1 fig s3 this suggests that terrestrial input of aromatic organic rich dom is mainly derived from inflowing large rivers including the two largest tributaries of the lake i e river dapu and river yincun in these regions previous studies suggested high terrestrial dom inputs from northwestern sub watersheds despite the relatively low disturbed land use and gdp here table s2 which coincided well with the high inflowing discharge from this region compared with the remaining areas zhou et al 2018a zhou et al 2018b the lake has a short average water residence time 300 d and riverine dom draining household sewage fishery effluent and terrestrial soil organic matter therefore contribute importantly to the dom pool in the lake zhou et al 2018a secondly the significant positive relationships between daily water level and a 350 suva254 ic it hix c2 and c4 of the two rivers fig 3 fig 4 were consistent with the findings of previous studies fasching et al 2016 which indicates that terrestrial aromatic dom increased with the increasing riverine water level as c2 is a typical terrestrial humic rich component and c4 is also closely associated with terrestrial soil organic matter inputs yamashita and jaffé 2008 this is further supported by the elevated doc in river dapu but not river yincun and the elevated bdoc dom aromaticity and percentages of humic like c2 and c4 in both rivers during rainstorms fig 5 the increased percentages of these two components during rainstorms with elevated water levels may be attributed to the enhanced mobilization of soil organic matter and terrestrial plant remnants rainstorm events result in an elevated flow path of surface runoff and groundwater flow from the deep organic depleted mineral layer to the upper organic rich and litter layer yang et al 2015 zhou et al 2020 which may further enhance both the freshness and aromaticity of the exported dom accordingly we found a negative association between pc1 and dom aromaticity with increasing water levels fig 6 the elevated aromaticity of dom during rainstorms may be explained by the inputs of rainwater humic rich dom during rainstorm events as rainwater dom is closely associated with aromatic atmospheric dust and aerosols or aerosol phase humic like substances zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 the aromatic fraction of dom has been suggested to be hydrophobic dilling and kaiser 2002 kothawala et al 2014 and dom aromaticity therefore increases with increasing removal efficiency during coagulation and associates closely with the formation potential of trihalomethane during disinfection edzwald and tobiason 1999 jung and son 2008 kothawala et al 2017 our results therefore highlight the importance of high frequency monitoring when advising regarding the time of withdrawal of raw water for drinking water treatment zhou et al 2020 and provides background information about the strong relationship between dom composition and hydrology in a large shallow eutrophic urban lake we found elevated bio degradability of dom exported via the two rivers during rainstorms which has important implications for co2 production and suggest storm water derived dom provides an important energy source for higher trophic levels of the food web this observation was supported by elevated bdoc in both rivers during rainstorm events compared with sunny days fig 5 and also the significant negative relationships between the daily water level and s 275 295 in both rivers fig 3 fig 4 bix c1 and c3 all decreased with increasing water level in both rivers fig 3 fig 4 suggesting rapid flushing and dilution of household effluents during rainstorms zhou et al 2020 c1 and c3 can be categorized into protein like components and likely linked to household and industrial wastewater inputs hosen et al 2014 zhou et al 2022 when the water levels of the two rivers were lower than 3 8 m a s l flood warning water level of both rivers the doc concentrations and bdoc of the two rivers rose with increasing water levels associated with rainfall events fig 2 this is likely due to the flushing of a large quantity of plant debris household effluents and terrestrial dom caused by enhanced rainfall in the watershed dhillon and inamdar 2013 hosen et al 2014 for example hosen et al 2014 found that mobilization and input of fresh dom with high bio lability contributed markedly to elevated bdoc in comparison during rainstorms when the water levels of the two rivers were higher than 3 8 m a s l i e above the flood warning water level of both rivers after long term rainfall we found that both doc and bdoc decreased with increasing water levels in the two rivers fig 2 the scatter found in the positive relationships between doc and water level fig 2 is likely due to a lag time between peak water levels and peak doc exports decreased doc with increasing water level in both rivers is consistent with a previous study finding that doc decreased with inflowing discharge due to local dilution zhou et al 2020 and a result of more water bypassing direct contact with soils and urban surfaces the concentration of doc peaked on the rising limb of flood discharge hydrographs and rapidly decreasing with continuation of rainstorm events is typical hood et al 2006 yoon and raymond 2012 the summed doc and bdoc fluxes from the two rivers were up to 1 44 104 t c yr 1 and 0 28 104 t c yr 1 respectively both being comparable with the summed inflowing doc and bdoc fluxes to lake qiandao one of the largest drinking water lakes in china with a watershed area of 1 04 104 km2 zhou et al 2020 in total more than 170 rivers or channels connect to lake taihu qin et al 2007 implying that the summed annual inflowing fluxes of doc and bdoc can be much higher than those from the two tributaries recorded in this study doc and bdoc decreased while the amount of river water rose with increasing water level in both rivers during flood warning water level periods fig 2 as also seen by yang et al 2019 and we found notably higher inflowing doc and bdoc fluxes during rainstorms compared with the other seasons the molecular composition of dom identified via ft icr ms revealed increased relative abundance of polycyclic and condensed aromatic and polyphenolic compounds coupled with decreased relative abundance of aliphatic compounds during rainstorms with high water levels fig 7b and this provides further evidence of the hypothesis that rainstorms enhanced the aromatic nature of dom despite being more bio labile the elevated m z during rainstorms with high water levels compared with low m z during the dry season with low water levels fig 7 suggests the occurrence of a higher molecular weight of dom during rainstorms compared with other time periods meanwhile we found that the relative abundance of polycyclic and condensed aromatic and polyphenolic compounds increased with increasing water level while the relative abundance of highly unsaturated and phenolic and aliphatic compounds decreased with increasing water level fig 7c f the close positive linkages between aromatic formulae and terrestrial humic like c2 fig 7c highlight a consistency between the bulk optical and molecular level composition of dom indicating that optical measurements coupled with ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry are promising tools to unravel the cycling of dom rainfall especially rainstorms controls the inflow discharge and thereby the water level of lake taihu located in a monsoon climate watershed and our results indicate an increased frequency of heavy rainfall 25 mm d 1 and rainstorm 50 mm d 1 events and enhanced intensity of heavy rainfall events during the past six decades fig 8 this implies that a higher frequency of elevated inputs of terrestrial soil and litter layer organic rich dom with high aromaticity from the upstream rivers to the lake is to be expected in a future wetter climate with more rainstorms in the watershed lakes are hotspots for the global carbon cycling and key sources of drinking water supply to large and mega cities globally in lake taihu riverine dom derived from the inflowing rivers of the watershed contributes primarily to the dom pool and thus controls the chemical composition and bio lability of dom in the lake suva254 has been used as an indicator of the removal efficiency of dom during water treatment kothawala et al 2017 and we observed that rainstorm events enhanced the aromaticity of dom discharged into the lake implying a higher removal efficiency of dom in a future wetter climate in the watershed the inflowing lake regions typically the area at the intersection of both allochthonous and autochthonous dom they often have intense priming effects bianchi 2011 and exhibit various biogeochemical processes and they are thus hotspots of greenhouse gas emissions rainstorm events will mobilize substantial freshly produced dom as well as household effluents soil organic matter and organic debris from imperious landscapes in the upstream watersheds these organic substances provide a large quantity of bio labile organic carbon substrate for heterotrophic microbes in the lake particularly in the inflowing lake areas future studies may be conducted to unravel the linkages between rainstorm events and greenhouse gas emissions in the inflowing lake areas as well as drinking water treatability for lake systems with important ecosystem services such as lake taihu 5 conclusions using extensive and long term high frequency observations we demonstrated how rainfall particularly rainstorm events shifts the molecular composition and bio lability of dom exported to lake taihu our results indicated that rainfall events enhanced the export of dom with high aromaticity and bio lability to the lake while rainstorms resulted in diluted doc and lower bdoc but elevated aromaticity we estimated that the annual mean inflow fluxes of doc to lake taihu were 1 15 0 14 104 t c yr 1 from river dapu and 2 92 0 38 103 t c yr 1 from river yincun and that the annual bdoc inflow fluxes were 0 23 0 06 104 t c yr 1 from river dapu and 0 53 0 07 103 t c yr 1 from river yincun ft icr ms results showed an increased relative abundance of polycyclic and condensed aromatic and polyphenolic compounds and reduced relative abundance of the highly unsaturated and phenolic and aliphatic compounds during rainstorm events enhanced input of aromatic and concurrent bio labile doc to the lake is to be expected in a future wetter climate with increased occurrence of heavy rainfall and rainstorm events

15227,lakes are hotspots for global carbon cycling yet few studies have explored how rainstorms alter the flux composition and bio lability of dissolved organic matter dom in inflowing rivers using high frequency monitoring we conducted extensive campaigns in the watershed of lake taihu and made daily observations for three years in its two largest inflowing tributaries river dapu and river yincun we found higher doc bio labile doc bdoc and specific uv absorbance suva254 levels in the northwestern inflowing regions compared with the remaining lake regions doc and bdoc increased during rainstorms in river dapu and doc declined due to local dilution and bdoc increased during rainstorms in river yincun we found that rainstorms resulted in increased dom absorbance a 350 suva254 and humification index hix and enhanced percentages of humic like fluorescent components polycyclic condensed aromatic and polyphenolic compounds as revealed from ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry ft icr ms while spectral slope s 275 295 and the percentages of protein like c1 and c3 declined during rainstorms compared with other seasons this can be explained by a combined flushing of catchment soil organic matter and household effluents the annual inflows of doc and bdoc to lake taihu were 1 15 0 18 104 t c yr 1 and 0 23 0 06 104 t c yr 1 from river dapu and 2 92 0 42 103 t c yr 1 and 0 53 0 07 103 t c yr 1 from river yincun respectively and the fluxes of doc and bdoc from both rivers increased during rainstorms we found an elevated frequency of heavy rainfall and rainstorms in the lake watershed during the past six decades we conclude that an elevated input of terrestrial organic rich dom with concurrent high aromaticity and high bio lability from inflowing rivers is likely to occur

land cover in terrestrial landscapes hosen et al 2014 zhou et al 2022 the quantity timing and chemical composition of dom exported to rivers and downstream linked lakes are largely constrained by land use topography and hydrology drake et al 2019 johnston et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 lakes and reservoirs are typically the most important sources of water for large and mega cities lake dom is of special concern for drinking water treatment as dom may interfere with the drinking water treatment processes and is expensive to remove baghoth et al 2011 tomlinson et al 2016 dom can be responsible for unpleasant odor and taste formation of carcinogenic disinfection by products and toxicity and bio availability of micropollutants stedmon et al 2011 kothawala et al 2017 the reactivity and fate of dom are closely associated with its chemical composition kellerman et al 2015 and the hydrological connectivity of upstream landscapes largely controls the chemical composition of dom in the downstream receiving waters lynch et al 2019 johnston et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 traditional approaches for quantifying riverine carbon fluxes often rely on periodical sampling at weekly monthly or even seasonal temporal resolution but this often fails to capture the biogeochemical changes in dom composition during episodical storm events hur et al 2014 spencer et al 2016 rainstorm events are a major driver that pulses the export of terrestrial dom and carbon bound nutrients into streams rivers and downstream linked lake ecosystems rainfall has been shown to be responsible for 86 of the annual dissolved organic carbon doc export with large rainfalls contributing to 57 of the doc exported in 30 small forested watersheds in the eastern usa raymond and saiers 2010 an extreme five day rainstorm event during the passage of hurricane irene resulted in the export of 43 of the annual doc and 31 of the annual dissolved organic nitrogen fluxes in esopus creek in new york yoon and raymond 2012 despite the importance of rainstorm events in influencing the export of doc only a few studies to date have explored the doc flux during rainstorm events yoon and raymond 2012 zhou et al 2020 long term high frequency field observations especially campaigns conducted during the occurrence of rainstorm events can help elaborate advanced management schemes for large lakes zhou et al 2020 however it remains unclear how rainstorms alter the flux chemical composition and bio lability of dom exported to large eutrophic lakes a recent study carried out in a mountainous valley in southern china indicated that the occurrence and intensity of heavy rainfall with rainfall intensity 25 mm d 1 and rainstorms with rainfall intensity 50 mm d 1 have increased during the past six decades zhou et al 2020 other recent studies conducted in the lake taihu watershed indicate that the net discharge of inflowing stream water is more relevant to dom composition than catchment area with urban land use or population density zhou et al 2018a zhou et al 2018b it remains unclear to what extent the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall and rainstorm events will increase specifically in the yangtze river delta which is one of the most developed regions in china it is also unclear if rainstorms will pulse the export of terrestrial dom and nutrients to lakes fueling further eutrophication of these waters the aim of this study is to quantify how rainstorm events impact the flux chemical composition and bio lability of dom exported to large shallow and hyper eutrophic lake taihu via its major inflowing tributaries we carried out an extensive field sampling campaign across the lake n 35 and its surrounding rivers n 209 during the wet to dry transition season and took daily measurements at the two largest inflowing tributaries river dapu and river yincun for almost three year from january 1 2019 to december 8 2021 n 1 073 we hypothesized that during extreme rainstorm events the mobilization of soil organic matter and flushing of non point source dom over impervious landscapes in densely populated areas would result in elevated export of both aromatic soil organic matter and aliphatic energy rich dom contributing to higher bio lability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lake taihu is the third largest freshwater lake in china it is located in the yangtze river delta and has a surface area of 2 338 km2 and a mean depth of 1 9 m fig s1 according to the taihu basin hydrological information service system http www tba gov cn the lake watershed can be

estimated that during rainstorms the doc flux ranged from 34 0 to 62 3 t d 1 and the bdoc flux from 10 3 to 25 5 t d 1 in river dapu while the doc flux ranged from 11 3 to 18 2 t d 1 and the bdoc flux

analysis pca results we used principal component analysis pca to investigate the impacts of rainstorms on the chemical composition of dom samples taken from river dapu and river yincun as for the river dapu samples the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 explained 68 3 and 10 6 respectively of all the variables included fig 6 in comparison for the samples collected from river yincun pc1 and pc2 explained 68 5 and 11 1 respectively for both rivers we found that s 275 295 c1 and c3 showed positive pc1 loadings whereas the daily water level a 350 suva254 hix c2 and c4 exhibited negative loadings fig 6 s 275 295 is typically negatively associated with the terrestrial input of dom i e increasing aromaticity helms et al 2008 c1 and c3 can be categorized into protein like components and suva254 and hix are positively associated with the aromaticity of dom implying that pc1 was negatively associated with the relative contribution of terrestrial aromatic dom and positively with the autochthonous production of protein like substances we found that pc1 scores decreased significantly with the increasing water levels in both rivers p 0 0001 fig 6 3 6 ft icr ms results from river dapu at contrasting water levels the mean ratio of mass to charge m z was lower mean m z 349 3 for the samples collected in the low water level season of river dapu 3 55 m than in the high water level season 5 05 m with a mean m z 363 3 fig 7 a in general there was an enrichment of formulae with lower h c 1 5 during high water level period fig 7b meanwhile the relative abundance weight contributions ra of polycyclic and condensed aromatic and polyphenolic compounds increased during high discharge events corresponding to depleted ra of the highly unsaturated and phenolic and aliphatic compounds fig 7b table s1 spearman s rank order correlation analysis revealed that the relative abundance of polycyclic and condensed aromatic and polyphenolic compounds increased with an increasing percentage of terrestrial humic like c2 and water level rho 0 5 p 0 05 while the relative abundance of the highly unsaturated and phenolic and aliphatic compounds decreased with an increasing percentage of terrestrial humic like c2 and water level rho 0 5 p 0 05 fig 7c d the percentage of terrestrial humic like c2 increased while the ra of h c ratio of dom decreased significantly with increasing water levels fig 7e f table s1 3 7 long term 1959 2021 trends of heavy rain and rainstorm events according to the historical rainfall monitoring data 1959 2021 of the meteorological gauging stations of dongshan wuxi yixing and huzhou surrounding lake taihu an occurrence frequencies of both heavy rainfall 25 mm d 1 and rainstorm 50 mm d 1 events were recorded fig 8 enhanced intensity of heavy rainfall events but not of rainstorm events was recorded from 1959 to 2021 based on the simple linear regression models we observed that the frequency of heavy rainfall increased from 11 times per year in 1959 to 14 times per year in 2021 and rainstorm events increased from twice per year in 1959 to 3 times per year in 2021 fig 8 the mean intensity of heavy rainfall in the lake catchment increased from 34 0 3 7 mm d 1 in 1959 to 41 2 1 4 mm d 1 in 2021 fig 8 4 discussion our extensive spatial and temporal sampling program coupled with long term high frequency field observations revealed that compared with low water seasons rainstorm events resulted in increased doc and bdoc levels and thereby rapid flushing and export of freshly mobilized terrestrial dom with high bio lability and concurrent high aromaticity to lake taihu via its two major inflowing tributaries the chemical composition of dom in lake taihu was strongly influenced by the mobilization of terrestrial soil organic matter and non point source effluents from the northwestern inflowing huxi sub watershed firstly we found high levels of doc in the northwestern inflowing huxi sub watershed and the northwestern lake regions coinciding with the high levels of suva254 and bdoc recorded here compared with the remaining sub watersheds and also the remaining lake regions fig 1 fig s3 this suggests that terrestrial input of aromatic organic rich dom is mainly derived from inflowing large rivers including the two largest tributaries of the lake i e river dapu and river yincun in these regions previous studies suggested high terrestrial dom inputs from northwestern sub watersheds despite the relatively low disturbed land use and gdp here table s2 which coincided well with the high inflowing discharge from this region compared with the remaining areas zhou et al 2018a zhou et al 2018b the lake has a short average water residence time 300 d and riverine dom draining household sewage fishery effluent and terrestrial soil organic matter therefore contribute importantly to the dom pool in the lake zhou et al 2018a secondly the significant positive relationships between daily water level and a 350 suva254 ic it hix c2 and c4 of the two rivers fig 3 fig 4 were consistent with the findings of previous studies fasching et al 2016 which indicates that terrestrial aromatic dom increased with the increasing riverine water level as c2 is a typical terrestrial humic rich component and c4 is also closely associated with terrestrial soil organic matter inputs yamashita and jaffé 2008 this is further supported by the elevated doc in river dapu but not river yincun and the elevated bdoc dom aromaticity and percentages of humic like c2 and c4 in both rivers during rainstorms fig 5 the increased percentages of these two components during rainstorms with elevated water levels may be attributed to the enhanced mobilization of soil organic matter and terrestrial plant remnants rainstorm events result in an elevated flow path of surface runoff and groundwater flow from the deep organic depleted mineral layer to the upper organic rich and litter layer yang et al 2015 zhou et al 2020 which may further enhance both the freshness and aromaticity of the exported dom accordingly we found a negative association between pc1 and dom aromaticity with increasing water levels fig 6 the elevated aromaticity of dom during rainstorms may be explained by the inputs of rainwater humic rich dom during rainstorm events as rainwater dom is closely associated with aromatic atmospheric dust and aerosols or aerosol phase humic like substances zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 the aromatic fraction of dom has been suggested to be hydrophobic dilling and kaiser 2002 kothawala et al 2014 and dom aromaticity therefore increases with increasing removal efficiency during coagulation and associates closely with the formation potential of trihalomethane during disinfection edzwald and tobiason 1999 jung and son 2008 kothawala et al 2017 our results therefore highlight the importance of high frequency monitoring when advising regarding the time of withdrawal of raw water for drinking water treatment zhou et al 2020 and provides background information about the strong relationship between dom composition and hydrology in a large shallow eutrophic urban lake we found elevated bio degradability of dom exported via the two rivers during rainstorms which has important implications for co2 production and suggest storm water derived dom provides an important energy source for higher trophic levels of the food web this observation was supported by elevated bdoc in both rivers during rainstorm events compared with sunny days fig 5 and also the significant negative relationships between the daily water level and s 275 295 in both rivers fig 3 fig 4 bix c1 and c3 all decreased with increasing water level in both rivers fig 3 fig 4 suggesting rapid flushing and dilution of household effluents during rainstorms zhou et al 2020 c1 and c3 can be categorized into protein like components and likely linked to household and industrial wastewater inputs hosen et al 2014 zhou et al 2022 when the water levels of the two rivers were lower than 3 8 m a s l flood warning water level of both rivers the doc concentrations and bdoc of the two rivers rose with increasing water levels associated with rainfall events fig 2 this is likely due to the flushing of a large quantity of plant debris household effluents and terrestrial dom caused by enhanced rainfall in the watershed dhillon and inamdar 2013 hosen et al 2014 for example hosen et al 2014 found that mobilization and input of fresh dom with high bio lability contributed markedly to elevated bdoc in comparison during rainstorms when the water levels of the two rivers were higher than 3 8 m a s l i e above the flood warning water level of both rivers after long term rainfall we found that both doc and bdoc decreased with increasing water levels in the two rivers fig 2 the scatter found in the positive relationships between doc and water level fig 2 is likely due to a lag time between peak water levels and peak doc exports decreased doc with increasing water level in both rivers is consistent with a previous study finding that doc decreased with inflowing discharge due to local dilution zhou et al 2020 and a result of more water bypassing direct contact with soils and urban surfaces the concentration of doc peaked on the rising limb of flood discharge hydrographs and rapidly decreasing with continuation of rainstorm events is typical hood et al 2006 yoon and raymond 2012 the summed doc and bdoc fluxes from the two rivers were up to 1 44 104 t c yr 1 and 0 28 104 t c yr 1 respectively both being comparable with the summed inflowing doc and bdoc fluxes to lake qiandao one of the largest drinking water lakes in china with a watershed area of 1 04 104 km2 zhou et al 2020 in total more than 170 rivers or channels connect to lake taihu qin et al 2007 implying that the summed annual inflowing fluxes of doc and bdoc can be much higher than those from the two tributaries recorded in this study doc and bdoc decreased while the amount of river water rose with increasing water level in both rivers during flood warning water level periods fig 2 as also seen by yang et al 2019 and we found notably higher inflowing doc and bdoc fluxes during rainstorms compared with the other seasons the molecular composition of dom identified via ft icr ms revealed increased relative abundance of polycyclic and condensed aromatic and polyphenolic compounds coupled with decreased relative abundance of aliphatic compounds during rainstorms with high water levels fig 7b and this provides further evidence of the hypothesis that rainstorms enhanced the aromatic nature of dom despite being more bio labile the elevated m z during rainstorms with high water levels compared with low m z during the dry season with low water levels fig 7 suggests the occurrence of a higher molecular weight of dom during rainstorms compared with other time periods meanwhile we found that the relative abundance of polycyclic and condensed aromatic and polyphenolic compounds increased with increasing water level while the relative abundance of highly unsaturated and phenolic and aliphatic compounds decreased with increasing water level fig 7c f the close positive linkages between aromatic formulae and terrestrial humic like c2 fig 7c highlight a consistency between the bulk optical and molecular level composition of dom indicating that optical measurements coupled with ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry are promising tools to unravel the cycling of dom rainfall especially rainstorms controls the inflow discharge and thereby the water level of lake taihu located in a monsoon climate watershed and our results indicate an increased frequency of heavy rainfall 25 mm d 1 and rainstorm 50 mm d 1 events and enhanced intensity of heavy rainfall events during the past six decades fig 8 this implies that a higher frequency of elevated inputs of terrestrial soil and litter layer organic rich dom with high aromaticity from the upstream rivers to the lake is to be expected in a future wetter climate with more rainstorms in the watershed lakes are hotspots for the global carbon cycling and key sources of drinking water supply to large and mega cities globally in lake taihu riverine dom derived from the inflowing rivers of the watershed contributes primarily to the dom pool and thus controls the chemical composition and bio lability of dom in the lake suva254 has been used as an indicator of the removal efficiency of dom during water treatment kothawala et al 2017 and we observed that rainstorm events enhanced the aromaticity of dom discharged into the lake implying a higher removal efficiency of dom in a future wetter climate in the watershed the inflowing lake regions typically the area at the intersection of both allochthonous and autochthonous dom they often have intense priming effects bianchi 2011 and exhibit various biogeochemical processes and they are thus hotspots of greenhouse gas emissions rainstorm events will mobilize substantial freshly produced dom as well as household effluents soil organic matter and organic debris from imperious landscapes in the upstream watersheds these organic substances provide a large quantity of bio labile organic carbon substrate for heterotrophic microbes in the lake particularly in the inflowing lake areas future studies may be conducted to unravel the linkages between rainstorm events and greenhouse gas emissions in the inflowing lake areas as well as drinking water treatability for lake systems with important ecosystem services such as lake taihu 5 conclusions using extensive and long term high frequency observations we demonstrated how rainfall particularly rainstorm events shifts the molecular composition and bio lability of dom exported to lake taihu our results indicated that rainfall events enhanced the export of dom with high aromaticity and bio lability to the lake while rainstorms resulted in diluted doc and lower bdoc but elevated aromaticity we estimated that the annual mean inflow fluxes of doc to lake taihu were 1 15 0 14 104 t c yr 1 from river dapu and 2 92 0 38 103 t c yr 1 from river yincun and that the annual bdoc inflow fluxes were 0 23 0 06 104 t c yr 1 from river dapu and 0 53 0 07 103 t c yr 1 from river yincun ft icr ms results showed an increased relative abundance of polycyclic and condensed aromatic and polyphenolic compounds and reduced relative abundance of the highly unsaturated and phenolic and aliphatic compounds during rainstorm events enhanced input of aromatic and concurrent bio labile doc to the lake is to be expected in a future wetter climate with increased occurrence of heavy rainfall and rainstorm events

its bloom and timely responding to possible consequences however the early prediction requires quantification of the solitary cells for a thorough understanding of bloom formation therefore we developed an accurate sensitive and specific qpcr assay for this need results show that the accuracy of qpcr was significantly enhanced by ameliorating dna barcode design improving genomic dna extraction and introducing a strategy of internal amplification control iac this approach reached a quantification limit of 1 cell reaction making low abundance cells 101 103 cells l detection possible and we also observed a plunge in the abundance of the solitary cells before the bloom outbreak in two winters in 2019 and 2020 for the first time which is quite unique from laboratory results showing an increase instead the plunge in solitary cell abundance might be associated with the attachment of solitary cells to solid matrices to form non solitary attached aggregate the precursor of colonies which gains supports from other studies and needs more investigations in the future therefore as the plunge in solitary cell abundance is a sign of colony formation it can be used as an early warning indicator to p globosa bloom graphical abstract improvement and application of qpcr assay revealed new insight on early warning of phaeocystis globosa bloom image graphical abstract keywords

world s first case of habs affecting the safety of coastal nuclear power plant yu et al 2017 therefore the early monitoring of p globosa is important for counter measurement of possible risk expansion however at present the highly applicable warning system of p globosa bloom is still in a predicament with the drastic change in global climate and the increasing eutrophication in coastal waters it is urgent to develop an efficient precise and applicable early warning system for p globosa bloom p globosa has a complex polymorphic life cycle and can live as solitary cells 3 10 µm in diameter or in mucous cyst colony up to 3 cm in size in the south china sea wang et al 2021b accumulating evidence suggests that the solitary cells precede the colonial bloom phase and that colonies develop from solitary cells peperzak and gabler schwarz 2012 rousseau et al 2007 zhang et al 2020 thus studying the dynamic variation of early stage solitary cells and its relationship with colony formation can further realize the early warning of p globosa bloom however available information of the early stage solitary cells in field research is quite limited although p globosa was described by lagerheim in 1893 wang et al 2021b the accurate quantification of early stage solitary cells has been a bottleneck issue for scientists therefore developing a rapid sensitive and accurate method for quantifying the solitary cells and applying it to the field is essential for understanding the relationship between the bloom formation and solitary cells and also for looking for potential indicators to early warning of the bloom with effective remediation of environment to date routine analyses of microbes in water relied mainly on light microscopy lm and flow cytometry fcm the classical lm method allows cells to be counted directly but microscopic analyses are time consuming and require a high level of taxonomic experience ezenarro et al 2021 fcm is a technique capable of rapidly counting environmental microbes weisse and bergkemper 2018 the latest scanning fcm coupled with clustering algorithms ca fcm technique allows users to develop a database consisting of multiple cellular parameters e g cell images size and pigment composition enabling automatic discrimination of interested cells from other species in the samples fragoso et al 2019 thomas et al 2018 however limited attempt was made regarding accurate quantification of some relatively special cells less than 10 µm in background of non target species furthermore few attempts achieved limited success in quantifying low detectable concentration 10 cells ml at the early stage of the bloom which continues to challenge both fcm and lm peperzak et al 2018 hence early detection requires a sensitive analytical technique capable of distinguishing and quantifying the interested cells quickly and accurately polymerase chain reaction pcr based genetic tools such as quantitative pcr qpcr has the potential to overcome the main limitations of early detection in high sensitivity high specificity and high throughput manner hatt et al 2013 truong et al 2015 qpcr has been widely applied to assess microbial contaminants in environmental waters devi et al 2021 kim et al 2013 lu et al 2020 penna et al 2015 however several limitations of pcr based assay primer bias from single nucleotide polymorphism snp sites boyle et al 2009 nikolausz et al 2009 walter et al 2007 presence of pcr inhibitors and dna extraction efficiency gibson et al 2012 green and field 2012 hatt et al 2013 kim et al 2013 were reported having affected the accuracy and robustness of absolute count first the snp in genomic dna would lead to the failure of the designed primers or probes in binding to the dna template resulting in ineffective detection for mutant templates secondly the qpcr efficiency is overly impaired when environmental samples contain inhibitory substance lastly loss in the preparation of dna templates is inevitable despite such limitations qpcr is considered one of the best methods for quantifying environmental microbes as the issues could be addressed with a series of optimization and improvement during method development kim et al 2013 undeniably careful attention to accurate and robust measurements is important which not only adds assurance to sample results but also provides more reliable conclusions for the decision makers based on the qpcr assay this work aims to address two issues 1 improving the previously mentioned limitation of pcr based assay and accomplishing accurate quantification for early stage p globosa solitary cells these crucial improvements include i ameliorating primers and probes design by screening snp to enhance quantitative accuracy fig 1 ii implementing a robust high purity and yield genomic dna extraction scheme to eradicate the effect of inhibitors on qpcr efficiency iii selecting an applicable freshwater species as internal amplification control iac to correct the loss during dna extraction 2 revealing the dynamic variation of solitary cells and its relationship with bloom formation and looking for earlier indicators for early warning from the perspective of early stage solitary cells 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area sampling sites and cruises the beibu gulf fig s1 was the target area of research it is one of the national key economic development zones of busy human activities and flourishing industries and fisheries especially in recent years there occurred the world s first case of habs affecting the safety of coastal nuclear power plant yu et al 2017 also the clog by p globosa colonies reoccurred in the following years wang et al 2021b therefore the beibu gulf area is highly typical and representative for developing and testing a method in the field six sites q1 q6 were set up in coastal waters near the nuclear power plant in qinzhou bay fig s1 to reveal the dynamic variation of solitary cells and its relationship with bloom formation we performed two winters of synchronous monitoring of solitary cells and colonies at sites q1 q6 in december 2019 january 2020 and at sites q1 q2 q4 q6 in november december 2020 2 2 environmental sample collection for solitary cells samples each water sample collected from the surface depth 5m or bottom depth 5m layer was aforehand filtered through a sieve 20 µm pore size to remove potential p globosa colonies and then was filtered to 0 45 µm micropore membrane mce 50 mm diameter jinteng tianjin china under a mild negative pressure 5 kpa the exact filtration volume 0 5 1 0 l depends on the turbid condition of seawater the collected samples were frozen instantly in liquid nitrogen to prevent active dna enzymes from degrading genetic dna for colony samples the detailed sampling method is described in supplementary material 1 section s1 1 2 3 microalgal culture table s1 lists the species taxonomy and required medium of all microalgae used in this study p globosa was isolated from the beibu gulf of the south china sea fig s1 in 2014 the other 12 seawater species and three freshwater species obtained from the guangxi beibu gulf marine research center were used to verify the specificity of dna barcodes all seawater species were cultured in f 2 medium with or without na2sio3 in sterilized seawater freshwater species were cultivated in bg 11 medium with sterilized ultrapure water all the cells were grown at 20 c in 12 12 h light dark cycle at photon flux density of 80 u mol 2s 1 2 4 genotype analysis and dna barcodes design the multicopy ribosomal gene rdna served as a quantitative target gene because they are more efficient to be detected than single copy genes when the total number of target cells is remarkably small the internal transcribed spacer its array consisting of the its1 5 8s and its2 regions of rdna is generally used as molecular markers to distinguish different species as high interspecific specificity compared to 18s and 28s yuan et al 2012 zhan et al 2019 therefore specific primers pg5 8sf and pg28r table 1 fig 1a were designed according to the 5 8s its2 28s sequence of p globosa downloaded from genbank parts of pcr amplicons of pg5 8sf and pg28sr were assigned for sanger sequencing while the others were cloned into t vector to construct recombinant plasmids fig 1b using peasy t1 cloning kit transgen biotech beijing china for sequencing afterward all sequencing results were analyzed for genotypes based on multiple sequence alignment to identify unknown snp fig 1c the qpcr primers and probe of p globosa were designed by avoiding the identified snp fig 1d with software primer express v 3 0 1 applied biosystems foster city usa according to a preliminary experiment fig s2 haematococcus pluvialis among the three freshwater species table s1 is an appropriate iac species the dna barcodes of iac h pluvialis were designed according to the same idea as p globosa by screening the known snp in the rdna sequence downloaded from genbank the specificities of each set of dna barcodes of p globosa and h pluvialis were validated by qpcr assay for the genomic dna of p globosa h pluvialis and 12 non target microalgae table s1 and three water samples also the qpcr products of positive signal samples were assigned for sanger sequencing to test specificity furtherly 2 5 screen of optimal genomic dna extraction schemes two silica column adsorption sca based methods plant genomic dna kit tiangen beijing china abbreviated to sca tg and dneasy powerplant pro kit qiagen hilden germany abbreviated to sca qg and one alcohol precipitation ap e g isopropanol based method dnaiso reagent takara dalian china abbreviated to ap tk were validated the sca qg method is equipped with a ball cone shaped bead to promote cell lysis under an additional grinding condition to further benefit comparison additional two steel beads 2 mm in diameter and a grinding process 20 hz for 2 min were added to the manufacturer s extraction protocols for both ap tk and sca tg methods key features of the three extraction schemes are presented in table 2 the suspension containing p globosa solitary cells 2 107 cells was prepared using sterilized seawater and filtered onto a 0 45 µm micropore membrane mce 50 mm diameter jinteng tianjin china the extraction performances yield and purity of cells on the membrane were assessed using agarose gel electrophoresis and varioskan lux thermo scientific waltham usa based on absorbance measurements at 260 280 and 230 nm a260 a280 and a230 dna yield was quantified according to the definition that 1 od absorbance at a260 is equivalent to 50 ng µl double stranded dna the a260 a280 ratios within 1 8 1 9 and a260 a230 2 indicate high dna purity 2 6 calibration curves previously constructed recombinant plasmid dna containing the 5 8s its2 28s gene served as dna standards to prepare calibration curves the copy number of recombinant plasmids n plasmid was determined according to the formula n plasmid a260 50 10 9 6 02 1023 l bp 650 where 50 represents 50 ng µl of double stranded dna when the a260 is equal to 1 od l bp is the length of recombinant plasmids in base pair bp and the 650 is the average mass of a base pair 650 dalton bp calibration curves from three independent repetitions were generated by implementing linear regression between the quantification cycle cq values and log10 of plasmids copies ranging from 107 to 101 copies n 9 2 7 preparation and analysis of simulated environmental samples the suspensions containing p globosa solitary cells ranging from the order of magnitudes 106 to 104 cells l and four non target species were prepared with 0 45 µm membrane filtered seawater checked by fcm to ensure no p globosa and other algae cells to simulate environmental samples table s2 these simulated water samples allow us to compare the specificity and accuracy of the qpcr and ca fcm method by detecting and quantifying the known number of target cells in a background of non target species for qpcr assay each multispecies suspension 1 l was filtered with 0 45 µm micropore membrane mce 50 mm diameter jinteng tianjin china and subsequently used for genomic dna extraction refer to supplementary material 1 section s1 3 and qpcr analysis refer to section 2 8 before fcm analysis the fluorescent beads 3 µm spherotech lake forest usa were spiked in each sample table s2 and served as an internal standard to validate quantitative accuracy suspensions were directly detected using cytosense cytobuoy woerden netherlands and cells were quantified with a previously prepared cellular identification database this database consisting of pulse profiles of target cells or particles fig s3 was developed according to the recommendation of thomas rutten projects detailed steps of creating the database and quantifying target cells are described in supplementary material 2 another batch of simulated environmental samples containing low concentration p globosa solitary cells ranging from the order of magnitudes 103 to 101 cells l were prepared to assay the sensitivity and accuracy of the qpcr method furtherly table s2 2 8 cellular quantification with qpcr assays the p globosa genomic dna was amplified with the specific primers and probe pgf1 pgr1 and pgp1 table 1 and the iac h pluvialis genomic dna was amplified with hpf hpr and hpp each sample included an iac and each plate contained a subsample of iac representing the positive control in pre extraction also each plate introduced no template control ntc using ddh2o as the dna template all qpcr reactions final volume of 20 µl consisted of 10 µl 2 goldstar probe mixture cowin biosciences taizhou china 0 4 µl forward reverse primers probe 10 µm and 50 low rox individually 1µl dna template and 7 4 µl ddh2o all qpcr experiments were run in triplicate and performed on an abi 7500 real time pcr system applied biosystems foster city usa with the following cycling program preheating at 95 c for 10 min 40 pcr cycles at 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 1 min 2 9 statistical analyses and performance parameters all data were analyzed with graphpad prism software v8 02 the student s t test for different data groups was performed to compare the differences upon the statistical assumption of unequal standard deviations between data groups a p 0 05 was defined significant all curve fitting was performed with the least squares regression model the limit of quantitation loq was determined according to the previous loq20 cv calculation method schwarz et al 2004 3 results and discussion 3 1 improvement of dna barcodes design to enhance accuracy through genotype analysis of p globosa 5 8s its2 28s sequences the 5 8s and 5 end its2 showed lower gene polymorphism than the whole sequence figs 1c and s4 hence to avoid the snp s effect on quantitative accuracy the perfect match primers and probe were designed in the conservative area 5 8s its2 the 5 ends pgf1 bases of 1 21st the middle pgp1 47 60th and the 3 ends pgr1 129 147th figs 1d and s4 similarly the perfect match dna barcodes of iac h pluvialis were designed in the conservative area of its1 5 8s table 1 fig s5 all qpcr primers and probes show high specificity table s3 the mere target species were able to be detected qpcr amplification signal after 40 amplification cycles but non target organisms were not furthermore amplicon sequencing results from samples with positive signals further support the specificity the amplicon sequences of environmental water samples and monoculture p globosa matched the 5 8s its2 regions of p globosa from ncbi txid33658 and the amplicon of iac matched the its1 5 8s fragment of h pluvialis ncbi txid44745 a probe pgp2 fig s4 contained a mutant base in the binding domain and comparable annealing temperature and gc content to pgp1 was designed which allowed us to compare the effect of snp on quantitative accuracy the identical genomic dna sample was assayed with qpcr using probes pgp1 and pgp2 separately the rdna copy number was determined by comparing the experimentally obtained cq value to previously prepared calibration curves fig s6 as shown in fig 2 only 49 of genes could be quantified effectively when the probe contained one snp at the binding domain the increased quantitative performance indicates that the accuracy could be improved significantly by optimizing the design of primers and probes similar findings regarding quantitative flaws from snp are reported in previous studies boyle et al 2009 ledeker and de long 2013 nikolausz et al 2009 walter et al 2007 however this essential factor has not yet aroused broad concern in many studies on the quantification of environmental microbes given that the snp is common in organismic genomes therefore the snp s effect on quantitative accuracy deserves more attention 3 2 extraction performances and selection of optimal extraction schemes according to verification results of the three extraction schemes the ap method ap tk produced the highest yield but lowest purity a260 a280 within 1 8 1 9 a260 a230 2 when compared to the two sca methods sca tg sca qg fig s7 the fact that the ap method tends to acquire a higher yield than the sca method has been shown in the previous studies on microbes extraction moore 2001 shi et al 2020 however contaminations of polysaccharides and protein could also be co precipitated with nucleic acid if these inhibitors were not effectively removed in the upstream step shi et al 2020 the lower ratio of a260 a230 from the ap tk method may be due to polysaccharides as phytoplankton especially p globosa are rich in polysaccharides flemming and wingender 2010 van rijssel et al 2000 and the extracted dna solution is quite sticky contamination of polysaccharides is troublesome interfering with downstream enzymatic applications e g pcr based assays bilgin et al 2009 polysaccharides are usually removed by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab uyua et al 2014 or high salt solution e g potassium acetate bilgin et al 2009 although the removal mechanisms of three methods were unexplored in the current study the two sca methods sca tg sca qg were undoubtedly more effective than the ap tk method in removing polysaccharides from the upstream step low purity from extraction affects mainly the accuracy of qpcr assay while low yield could impair the detection limit therefore simultaneous consideration of high purity and yield is crucial for downstream quantification although the sca tg method lost its advantage in dna yield relative to the ap tk scheme it showed the highest purity a260 a280 1 8 a260 a230 2 fig s7 for higher yield and purity the sca tg method was selected with further modification by using ap e g isopropanol instead of the sca strategy to recover genomic dna table 2 map tg method as shown in fig 3 the map tg scheme provided a significantly 2 3 times higher yield than the original sca strategy and comparable purity the dramatic yield increase with isopropanol precipitation could be explained that a part of dna irreversibly bound with silica is effectively recovered shi et al 2020 in brief the increased extraction performance indicates that the modified method map tg is more conducive to early detection to further validate the map tg method free of inhibitors when extracting actual water sample pcr inhibition was checked by the qpcr amplification of 5 fold serial dilutions of p globosa genomic dna extracted from natural seawater and evaluated by the amplification efficiency e 10 1 slope 1 bustin et al 2009 the result demonstrates the effective removal of inhibitors with the improved method as the amplification efficiency from three independent extractions was nearly 100 e 99 185 0 283 fig s8 previous works introduced the mutant taq polymerase milligan et al 2018 pcr additives schriewer et al 2011 and the additional dilution for dna extracts mckee et al 2015 to reduce inhibitor s interference to a certain extent these developments alleviated the sample interference in molecular quantification however these optimizations add cost also diluting the dna extracts could generate false negative signals and increase the variability especially for environmental water samples with low target abundance liu et al 2021a mckee et al 2015 in this work through screening and improvement for extraction schemes based on commercial reagents sample interference due to inhibitors also can be solved efficiently in brief the map tg method was selected for dna extraction on the membrane and detailed schemes are described in supplementary material 1 section s1 3 3 3 development and estimation of iac for dna loss the loss from extraction is always inevitable during the preparation of dna template resulting in inaccurate quantification we introduced an iac strategy to correct the loss before extraction the high purity h pluvialis genomic dna extracted from the map tg method as iac was spiked into each sample after qpcr amplification the loss could be calculated by comparing the changes in cq values of iac before and after extraction the extraction efficiency e extr was determined according to eq 1 with a slight modification of li et al 2015 1 e extr 1 e c q before c q after v final v initial 100 where e is the qpcr efficiency of hpf hpr and hpp e 99 96 fig s9 cq before and cq after are respectively the cq values of iac before extraction and after extraction v final is the final eluate volume after extraction v initial is the volume of iac solution added to the pre extracted sample and the ratio of v final v initial is the dilution factor the h pluvialis genomic dna as an iac system was validated by checking the coefficient of variation cv in inter and intra assay the cv of both inter and intra assay were less than 5 fig s10 table s4 which meets the acceptable criteria the results indicate that the h pluvialis genomic dna is an appropriate standard which allows us to calculate the loss precisely and reproducibly to further validate the iac strategy that could be applied to quantify target dna accurately 25 solitary cells samples ranging from 1 92 102 2 07 104 cells µl accompanied by iac standards were extracted using the map tg method and subsequently amplified with qpcr to facilitate the evaluation of quantitative performance two prediction models the presence of iac as shown in fig 4 a the absence of iac in fig 4b were constructed according to eq 2 which allows us to calculate the predicted cell number n cell by inserting the estimated rdna copy number n rdna into the prediction function eq 3 we evaluated the quantitative performance of the two prediction functions separately by comparing the predicted via eq 3 with the actual cell count the results show that the prediction model in the presence of iac was more accurate in quantifying the cells because the predictions did not deviate significantly from the actual values figs 4a and s11a whereas the predictions from the model without iac fig 4b mostly overestimated the actual outcomes fig s11b also the significance of iac was further confirmed by the decreased root mean square error rmse 0 07 vs 0 48 fig s11 between the predictions and the actuals when compared to the prediction function without iac 2 log 10 n rdna k log 10 n cell b where k and b are slope and intercept of equation respectively log10 n rdna the log10 of rdna copy number n rdna estimated via calibration curves fig s6 is dependent variable log10 n cell the log10 of actual cell number n cell is independent variable 3 log 10 n cell log 10 n rdna b k where k and b are the predicted slope and intercept via regression model eq 2 respectively k 1 0082 b 1 3101 in prediction models of the presence of iac fig 4a k 1 0784 b 0 8906 in prediction models without iac fig 4b lo g 10 n cell is the predicted log10 of cell number by inserting the estimated n rdna into this prediction function relative to recombinant plasmid standards the purified genomic dna as iac to quantify loss is portable and inexpensive because the plasmid standards require the purchase of additional vectors and the construction of recombinant plasmids sales ortells et al 2015 however the naked dna e g genomic dna plasmid may not adequately represent the efficiency in the cellular lysis step which could underestimate losses in the extraction shi et al 2020 nevertheless the flaw in naked dna could be neglected if cell lysis is adequate in the present work the additional bead beating procedure in the map tg method can also ensure the sufficient lysis of cells fig s12 therefore the naked dna also meets the need for the accurate assessment of dna loss but only if the lysis step can be ensured to lyse cells adequately 3 4 quantification of p globosa solitary cells from simulated environmental water samples for qpcr assay cell number n cell was calculated using the following equation 4 n cell 10 log 10 n rdna b k where k and b are the slope and intercept of prediction function introducing iac respectively k 1 0082 b 1 3101 fig 4a log10 n rdna is the log10 of rdna copy number estimated via calibration curves fig s6 to validate the performance of the improved qpcr method we compare the specificity and accuracy of qpcr and ca fcm method by quantifying the simulated environmental samples containing the known number of solitary cells and non target species we concluded that i qpcr is more specific and accurate for detecting target cells as a significantly lower order of magnitude difference between expected and observed cell numbers compared to the ca fcm method fig 5 a c vs d f p 0 05 moreover a strong correlation r 0 997 p 0 001 fig 5g between the expected and observed cell numbers ranging 106 101 cells in magnitude and lower re value fig 5h p 0 05 further support the conclusion for the fcm method the high re value occurred in mainly the low density groups figs 5f and s13g i one possible explanation is that some non target algae were probably mistaken as p globosa when the target concentration was relatively low 1 and the fluorescence measurement parameters of selected non target cells morphology size are similar to the target cells ii both methods have comparable precision with no statistically significant difference in the cv p 0 17 fig 5i the reproducibility of the developed qpcr method was analyzed as cv mean value of quantifying target cells in all concentrations ranging from 1 5 106 to 2 101 cells l table s2 casabianca et al 2013 penna et al 2015 the least number of 20 cells could be quantified from a background of non target cells fig 5g with a low cv value in inter assay 22 fig 5i the mean cv value of 13 further supports the reproducibility furthermore the loq schwarz et al 2004 of p globosa solitary cells was estimated to be 45 cells corresponding to one cell per reaction fig s14 these results indicate that the qpcr method we developed has the potential for implementing accurate and robust early monitoring on p globosa solitary cells 3 5 dynamic variation of solitary cells and its relationship with bloom formation the abundance of solitary cells samples ranged from 2 9 102 to 2 4 106 cells l in the winter 2019 and from 2 6 101 to 4 7 105 cells l in the winter 2020 fig 6 a b the colonial bloom was also found in the winters in winter 2019 the colony formation was observed from january 18 2020 in five sites q1 q5 table s5a while in winter 2020 a few colonies initially appeared at two spots on november 22 2020 later the abundance of colonies increased at all sites on december 02 2020 table s5b it is noteworthy that the abundance of solitary cells declined before the bloom stage in both winters fig 6c d ranging from 2 61 102 to 1 27 103 cells l fig s15 however the decline in solitary cell abundance before the bloom stage has never been detected in previous field studies due to limitations in the sensitivity of monitoring methods for example in many field studies based on non qpcr methods the lowest detectable p globosa cell abundance was at the magnitude of 104 cells l table s6 in contrast our high sensitivity method can quantitatively detect a low abundance of cells down to 101 103 cells l and in addition with the method we discovered for the first time the plunge in solitary cell abundance before they bloom interestingly the dynamic variation rule of solitary cells before bloom conflicts with that of indoor experiment under conventional culture conditions nutrient light and temperature colony formation is a process accompanied by a continuous increase in solitary cell abundance liu et al 2021b zhang et al 2020 even under restrained growth conditions brussaard et al 2005 ren et al 2021 tang 2003 thus the plunge in solitary cell abundance before bloom observed in the field is more likely to be caused by other factors in fact earlier scene studies found that the p globosa colonies at the beginning of bloom attached to diatoms and suggested that diatoms could provide a solid substrate for colony formation rousseau et al 1994 sazhin et al 2007 furthermore in the known life history of p globosa in natural waters peperzak and gabler schwarz 2012 the colony formation involves several processes of i attachment of solitary cells to the solid substrate e g diatoms usually 20 µm ii morphological transformation from solitary to non solitary state iii formation of attached aggregate and iv colony construction therefore the plunge in solitary cell abundance before bloom could be due to solitary cells attachment to some substrates to form non solitary attached aggregate the basis of colony construction another observation worth noting was that neither such a plunge in solitary cell abundance nor colony appearance in q6 sites was observed in winter 2019 fig 6a table s5a but in winter of 2020 fig 6b after the plunge observed in 2020 numerous colonies burst into bloom table s5b therefore coupling with the above reasonable explanation for the plunge in abundance we believe that the bloom formation was strongly associated with the sharp decline in solitary cell abundance which could be considered an effective indicator to the bloom formation previous studies have used seawater viscosity kang et al 2020 characteristic pigment content wang et al 2021a and threshold of cell density 106 cells l ospar commission 2005 to forecast bloom appearance these indicators are usually observed only after colony formation as colonies can increase and expand rapidly veldhuis et al 2005 wang et al 2021b it could leave regulators with insufficient time to react this study provided an accurate prompt method and the high time sensitive indicator to forecast early the bloom outbreak and allow regulators to well curb the bloom e g spraying of clay yu et al 2017 4 conclusions this work emphasizes methodology development and application crucial conclusions are the accuracy of qpcr could be improved via the improvement of dna barcode design and dna extraction and the introduction of iac to control the loss our method provides a novel accurate and sensitive tool for monitoring early stage p globosa solitary cells by quantification estimation which has been a difficult task previously p globosa solitary cell abundance declined before the bloom stage this decline could be related to the formation of attached aggregate precursors of colonies by solitary cells attached to a solid matrix this new finding help reveal the mechanism of p globosa bloom in natural waters the plunge in solitary cell abundance may be used as a good indicator for the early warning of p globosa bloom which will promote the management and even the solution of the bloom problem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

marine research center and guangxi academy of sciences nanning 530007 china corresponding authors phaeocystis globosa bloom develops from its early solitary cells providing clues for early warning of its bloom and timely responding to possible consequences however the early prediction requires quantification of the solitary cells for a thorough understanding of bloom formation therefore we developed an accurate sensitive and specific qpcr assay for this need results show that the accuracy of qpcr was significantly enhanced by ameliorating dna barcode design improving genomic dna extraction and introducing a strategy of internal amplification control iac this approach reached a quantification limit of 1 cell reaction making low abundance cells 101 103 cells l detection possible and we also observed a plunge in the abundance of the solitary cells before the bloom outbreak in two winters in 2019 and 2020 for the first time which is quite unique from laboratory results showing an increase instead the plunge in solitary cell abundance might be associated with the attachment of solitary cells to solid matrices to form non solitary attached aggregate the precursor of colonies which gains supports from other studies and needs more investigations in the future therefore as the plunge in solitary cell abundance is a sign of colony formation it can be used as an early warning indicator to p globosa bloom graphical abstract improvement and application of qpcr assay revealed new insight on early warning of phaeocystis globosa bloom image graphical abstract keywords

impact of harmful algal blooms habs on public health tourism fisheries and ecosystems has being increasing in the past few decades drawing much concern from scientists and governments glibert et al

urgent to develop an efficient precise and applicable early warning system for p globosa bloom p globosa has a complex polymorphic life cycle and can live as solitary cells 3 10 µm in diameter or in mucous cyst colony up to 3 cm in size in the south china sea wang et al 2021b accumulating evidence suggests that the solitary cells precede the colonial bloom phase and that colonies develop from solitary cells peperzak and gabler schwarz 2012 rousseau et al 2007 zhang et al 2020 thus studying the dynamic variation of early stage solitary cells and its relationship with colony formation can further realize the early warning of p globosa bloom however available information of the early stage solitary cells in field research is quite limited although p globosa was described by lagerheim in 1893 wang et al 2021b the accurate quantification of early stage solitary cells has been a bottleneck issue for scientists therefore developing a rapid sensitive and accurate method for quantifying the solitary cells and applying it to the field is essential for understanding the relationship between the bloom formation and solitary cells and also for looking for potential indicators to early warning of the bloom with effective remediation of environment to date routine analyses of microbes in water relied mainly on light microscopy lm and flow cytometry fcm the classical lm method allows cells to be counted directly but microscopic analyses are time consuming and require a high level of taxonomic experience ezenarro et al 2021 fcm is a technique capable of rapidly counting environmental microbes weisse and bergkemper 2018 the latest scanning fcm coupled with clustering algorithms ca fcm technique allows users to develop a database consisting of multiple cellular parameters e g cell images size and pigment composition enabling automatic discrimination of interested cells from other species in the samples fragoso et al 2019 thomas et al 2018 however limited attempt was made regarding accurate quantification of some relatively special cells less than 10 µm in background of non target species furthermore few attempts achieved limited success in quantifying low detectable concentration 10 cells ml at the early stage of the bloom which continues to challenge both fcm and lm peperzak et al 2018 hence early detection requires a sensitive analytical technique capable of distinguishing and quantifying the interested cells quickly and accurately polymerase chain reaction pcr based genetic tools such as quantitative pcr qpcr has the potential to overcome the main limitations of early detection in high sensitivity high specificity and high throughput manner hatt et al 2013 truong et al 2015 qpcr has been widely applied to assess microbial contaminants in environmental waters devi et al 2021 kim et al 2013 lu et al 2020 penna et al 2015 however several limitations of pcr based assay primer bias from single nucleotide polymorphism snp sites boyle et al 2009 nikolausz et al 2009 walter et al 2007 presence of pcr inhibitors and dna extraction efficiency gibson et al 2012 green and field 2012 hatt et al 2013 kim et al 2013 were reported having affected the accuracy and robustness of absolute count first the snp in genomic dna would lead to the failure of the designed primers or probes in binding to the dna template resulting in ineffective detection for mutant templates secondly the qpcr efficiency is overly impaired when environmental samples contain inhibitory substance lastly loss in the preparation of dna templates is inevitable despite such limitations qpcr is considered one of the best methods for quantifying environmental microbes as the issues could be addressed with a series of optimization and improvement during method development kim et al 2013 undeniably careful attention to accurate and robust measurements is important which not only adds assurance to sample results but also provides more reliable conclusions for the decision makers based on the qpcr assay this work aims to address two issues 1 improving the previously mentioned limitation of pcr based assay and accomplishing accurate quantification for early stage p globosa solitary cells these crucial improvements include i ameliorating primers and probes design by screening snp to enhance quantitative accuracy fig 1 ii implementing a robust high purity and yield genomic dna extraction scheme to eradicate the effect of inhibitors on qpcr efficiency iii selecting an applicable freshwater species as internal amplification control iac to correct the loss during dna extraction 2 revealing the dynamic variation of solitary cells and its relationship with bloom formation and looking for earlier indicators for early warning from the perspective of early stage solitary cells 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area sampling sites and cruises the beibu gulf fig s1 was the target area of research it is one of the national key economic development zones of busy human activities and flourishing industries and fisheries especially in recent years there occurred the world s first case of habs affecting the safety of coastal nuclear power plant yu et al 2017 also the clog by p globosa colonies reoccurred in the following years wang et al 2021b therefore the beibu gulf area is highly typical and representative for developing and testing a method in the field six sites q1 q6 were set up in coastal waters near the nuclear power plant in qinzhou bay fig s1 to reveal the dynamic variation of solitary cells and its relationship with bloom formation we performed two winters of synchronous monitoring of solitary cells and colonies at sites q1 q6 in december 2019 january 2020 and at sites q1 q2 q4 q6 in november december 2020 2 2 environmental sample collection for solitary cells samples each water sample collected from the surface depth 5m or bottom depth 5m layer was aforehand filtered through a sieve 20 µm pore size to remove potential p globosa colonies and then was filtered to 0 45 µm micropore membrane mce 50 mm diameter jinteng tianjin china under a mild negative pressure 5 kpa the exact filtration volume 0 5 1 0 l depends on the turbid condition of seawater the collected samples were frozen instantly in liquid nitrogen to prevent active dna enzymes from degrading genetic dna for colony samples the detailed sampling method is described in supplementary material 1 section s1 1 2 3 microalgal culture table s1 lists the species taxonomy and required medium of all microalgae used in this study p globosa was isolated from the beibu gulf of the south china sea fig s1 in 2014 the other 12 seawater species and three freshwater species obtained from the guangxi beibu gulf marine research center were used to verify the specificity of dna barcodes all seawater species were cultured in f 2 medium with or without na2sio3 in sterilized seawater freshwater species were cultivated in bg 11 medium with sterilized ultrapure water all the cells were grown at 20 c in 12 12 h light dark cycle at photon flux density of 80 u mol 2s 1 2 4 genotype analysis and dna barcodes design the multicopy ribosomal gene rdna served as a quantitative target gene because they are more efficient to be detected than single copy genes when the total number of target cells is remarkably small the internal transcribed spacer its array consisting of the its1 5 8s and its2 regions of rdna is generally used as molecular markers to distinguish different species as high interspecific specificity compared to 18s and 28s yuan et al 2012 zhan et al 2019 therefore specific primers pg5 8sf and pg28r table 1 fig 1a were designed according to the 5 8s its2 28s sequence of p globosa downloaded from genbank parts of pcr amplicons of pg5 8sf and pg28sr were assigned for sanger sequencing while the others were cloned into t vector to construct recombinant plasmids fig 1b using peasy t1 cloning kit transgen biotech beijing china for sequencing afterward all sequencing results were analyzed for genotypes based on multiple sequence alignment to identify unknown snp fig 1c the qpcr primers and probe of p globosa were designed by avoiding the identified snp fig 1d with software primer express v 3 0 1 applied biosystems foster city usa according to a preliminary experiment fig s2 haematococcus pluvialis among the three freshwater species table s1 is an appropriate iac species the dna barcodes of iac h pluvialis were designed according to the same idea as p globosa by screening the known snp in the rdna sequence downloaded from genbank the specificities of each set of dna barcodes of p globosa and h pluvialis were validated by qpcr assay for the genomic dna of p globosa h pluvialis and 12 non target microalgae table s1 and three water samples also the qpcr products of positive signal samples were assigned for sanger sequencing to test specificity furtherly 2 5 screen of optimal genomic dna extraction schemes two silica column adsorption sca based methods plant genomic dna kit tiangen beijing china abbreviated to sca tg and dneasy powerplant pro kit qiagen hilden germany abbreviated to sca qg and one alcohol precipitation ap e g isopropanol based method dnaiso reagent takara dalian china abbreviated to ap tk were validated the sca qg method is equipped with a ball cone shaped bead to promote cell lysis under an additional grinding condition to further benefit comparison additional two steel beads 2 mm in diameter and a grinding process 20 hz for 2 min were added to the manufacturer s extraction protocols for both ap tk and sca tg methods key features of the three extraction schemes are presented in table 2 the suspension containing p globosa solitary cells 2 107 cells was prepared using sterilized seawater and filtered onto a 0 45 µm micropore membrane mce 50 mm diameter jinteng tianjin china the extraction performances yield and purity of cells on the membrane were assessed using agarose gel electrophoresis and varioskan lux thermo scientific waltham usa based on absorbance measurements at 260 280 and 230 nm a260 a280 and a230 dna yield was quantified according to the definition that 1 od absorbance at a260 is equivalent to 50 ng µl double stranded dna the a260 a280 ratios within 1 8 1 9 and a260 a230 2 indicate high dna purity 2 6 calibration curves previously constructed recombinant plasmid dna containing the 5 8s its2 28s gene served as dna standards to prepare calibration curves the copy number of recombinant plasmids n plasmid was determined according to the formula n plasmid a260 50 10 9 6 02 1023 l bp 650 where 50 represents 50 ng µl of double stranded dna when the a260 is equal to 1 od l bp is the length of recombinant plasmids in base pair bp and the 650 is the average mass of a base pair 650 dalton bp calibration curves from three independent repetitions were generated by implementing linear regression between the quantification cycle cq values and log10 of plasmids copies ranging from 107 to 101 copies n 9 2 7 preparation and analysis of simulated environmental samples the suspensions containing p globosa solitary cells ranging from the order of magnitudes 106 to 104 cells l and four non target species were prepared with 0 45 µm membrane filtered seawater checked by fcm to ensure no p globosa and other algae cells to simulate environmental samples table s2 these simulated water samples allow us to compare the specificity and accuracy of the qpcr and ca fcm method by detecting and quantifying the known number of target cells in a background of non target species for qpcr assay each multispecies suspension 1 l was filtered with 0 45 µm micropore membrane mce 50 mm diameter jinteng tianjin china and subsequently used for genomic dna extraction refer to supplementary material 1 section s1 3 and qpcr analysis refer to section 2 8 before fcm analysis the fluorescent beads 3 µm spherotech lake forest usa were spiked in each sample table s2 and served as an internal standard to validate quantitative accuracy suspensions were directly detected using cytosense cytobuoy woerden netherlands and cells were quantified with a previously prepared cellular identification database this database consisting of pulse profiles of target cells or particles fig s3 was developed according to the recommendation of thomas rutten projects detailed steps of creating the database and quantifying target cells are described in supplementary material 2 another batch of simulated environmental samples containing low concentration p globosa solitary cells ranging from the order of magnitudes 103 to 101 cells l were prepared to assay the sensitivity and accuracy of the qpcr method furtherly table s2 2 8 cellular quantification with qpcr assays the p globosa genomic dna was amplified with the specific primers and probe pgf1 pgr1 and pgp1 table 1 and the iac h pluvialis genomic dna was amplified with hpf hpr and hpp each sample included an iac and each plate contained a subsample of iac representing the positive control in pre extraction also each plate introduced no template control ntc using ddh2o as the dna template all qpcr reactions final volume of 20 µl consisted of 10 µl 2 goldstar probe mixture cowin biosciences taizhou china 0 4 µl forward reverse primers probe 10 µm and 50 low rox individually 1µl dna template and 7 4 µl ddh2o all qpcr experiments were run in triplicate and performed on an abi 7500 real time pcr system applied biosystems foster city usa with the following cycling program preheating at 95 c for 10 min 40 pcr cycles at 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 1 min 2 9 statistical analyses and performance parameters all data were analyzed with graphpad prism software v8 02 the student s t test for different data groups was performed to compare the differences upon the statistical assumption of unequal standard deviations between data groups a p 0 05 was defined significant all curve fitting was performed with the least squares regression model the limit of quantitation loq was determined according to the previous loq20 cv calculation method schwarz et al 2004 3 results and discussion 3 1 improvement of dna barcodes design to enhance accuracy through genotype analysis of p globosa 5 8s its2 28s sequences the 5 8s and 5 end its2 showed lower gene polymorphism than the whole sequence figs 1c and s4 hence to avoid the snp s effect on quantitative accuracy the perfect match primers and probe were designed in the conservative area 5 8s its2 the 5 ends pgf1 bases of 1 21st the middle pgp1 47 60th and the 3 ends pgr1 129 147th figs 1d and s4 similarly the perfect match dna barcodes of iac h pluvialis were designed in the conservative area of its1 5 8s table 1 fig s5 all qpcr primers and probes show high specificity table s3 the mere target species were able to be detected qpcr amplification signal after 40 amplification cycles but non target organisms were not furthermore amplicon sequencing results from samples with positive signals further support the specificity the amplicon sequences of environmental water samples and monoculture p globosa matched the 5 8s its2 regions of p globosa from ncbi txid33658 and the amplicon of iac matched the its1 5 8s fragment of h pluvialis ncbi txid44745 a probe pgp2 fig s4 contained a mutant base in the binding domain and comparable annealing temperature and gc content to pgp1 was designed which allowed us to compare the effect of snp on quantitative accuracy the identical genomic dna sample was assayed with qpcr using probes pgp1 and pgp2 separately the rdna copy number was determined by comparing the experimentally obtained cq value to previously prepared calibration curves fig s6 as shown in fig 2 only 49 of genes could be quantified effectively when the probe contained one snp at the binding domain the increased quantitative performance indicates that the accuracy could be improved significantly by optimizing the design of primers and probes similar findings regarding quantitative flaws from snp are reported in previous studies boyle et al 2009 ledeker and de long 2013 nikolausz et al 2009 walter et al 2007 however this essential factor has not yet aroused broad concern in many studies on the quantification of environmental microbes given that the snp is common in organismic genomes therefore the snp s effect on quantitative accuracy deserves more attention 3 2 extraction performances and selection of optimal extraction schemes according to verification results of the three extraction schemes the ap method ap tk produced the highest yield but lowest purity a260 a280 within 1 8 1 9 a260 a230 2 when compared to the two sca methods sca tg sca qg fig s7 the fact that the ap method tends to acquire a higher yield than the sca method has been shown in the previous studies on microbes extraction moore 2001 shi et al 2020 however contaminations of polysaccharides and protein could also be co precipitated with nucleic acid if these inhibitors were not effectively removed in the upstream step shi et al 2020 the lower ratio of a260 a230 from the ap tk method may be due to polysaccharides as phytoplankton especially p globosa are rich in polysaccharides flemming and wingender 2010 van rijssel et al 2000 and the extracted dna solution is quite sticky contamination of polysaccharides is troublesome interfering with downstream enzymatic applications e g pcr based assays bilgin et al 2009 polysaccharides are usually removed by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab uyua et al 2014 or high salt solution e g potassium acetate bilgin et al 2009 although the removal mechanisms of three methods were unexplored in the current study the two sca methods sca tg sca qg were undoubtedly more effective than the ap tk method in removing polysaccharides from the upstream step low purity from extraction affects mainly the accuracy of qpcr assay while low yield could impair the detection limit therefore simultaneous consideration of high purity and yield is crucial for downstream quantification although the sca tg method lost its advantage in dna yield relative to the ap tk scheme it showed the highest purity a260 a280 1 8 a260 a230 2 fig s7 for higher yield and purity the sca tg method was selected with further modification by using ap e g isopropanol instead of the sca strategy to recover genomic dna table 2 map tg method as shown in fig 3 the map tg scheme provided a significantly 2 3 times higher yield than the original sca strategy and comparable purity the dramatic yield increase with isopropanol precipitation could be explained that a part of dna irreversibly bound with silica is effectively recovered shi et al 2020 in brief the increased extraction performance indicates that the modified method map tg is more conducive to early detection to further validate the map tg method free of inhibitors when extracting actual water sample pcr inhibition was checked by the qpcr amplification of 5 fold serial dilutions of p globosa genomic dna extracted from natural seawater and evaluated by the amplification efficiency e 10 1 slope 1 bustin et al 2009 the result demonstrates the effective removal of inhibitors with the improved method as the amplification efficiency from three independent extractions was nearly 100 e 99 185 0 283 fig s8 previous works introduced the mutant taq polymerase milligan et al 2018 pcr additives schriewer et al 2011 and the additional dilution for dna extracts mckee et al 2015 to reduce inhibitor s interference to a certain extent these developments alleviated the sample interference in molecular quantification however these optimizations add cost also diluting the dna extracts could generate false negative signals and increase the variability especially for environmental water samples with low target abundance liu et al 2021a mckee et al 2015 in this work through screening and improvement for extraction schemes based on commercial reagents sample interference due to inhibitors also can be solved efficiently in brief the map tg method was selected for dna extraction on the membrane and detailed schemes are described in supplementary material 1 section s1 3 3 3 development and estimation of iac for dna loss the loss from extraction is always inevitable during the preparation of dna template resulting in inaccurate quantification we introduced an iac strategy to correct the loss before extraction the high purity h pluvialis genomic dna extracted from the map tg method as iac was spiked into each sample after qpcr amplification the loss could be calculated by comparing the changes in cq values of iac before and after extraction the extraction efficiency e extr was determined according to eq 1 with a slight modification of li et al 2015 1 e extr 1 e c q before c q after v final v initial 100 where e is the qpcr efficiency of hpf hpr and hpp e 99 96 fig s9 cq before and cq after are respectively the cq values of iac before extraction and after extraction v final is the final eluate volume after extraction v initial is the volume of iac solution added to the pre extracted sample and the ratio of v final v initial is the dilution factor the h pluvialis genomic dna as an iac system was validated by checking the coefficient of variation cv in inter and intra assay the cv of both inter and intra assay were less than 5 fig s10 table s4 which meets the acceptable criteria the results indicate that the h pluvialis genomic dna is an appropriate standard which allows us to calculate the loss precisely and reproducibly to further validate the iac strategy that could be applied to quantify target dna accurately 25 solitary cells samples ranging from 1 92 102 2 07 104 cells µl accompanied by iac standards were extracted using the map tg method and subsequently amplified with qpcr to facilitate the evaluation of quantitative performance two prediction models the presence of iac as shown in fig 4 a the absence of iac in fig 4b were constructed according to eq 2 which allows us to calculate the predicted cell number n cell by inserting the estimated rdna copy number n rdna into the prediction function eq 3 we evaluated the quantitative performance of the two prediction functions separately by comparing the predicted via eq 3 with the actual cell count the results show that the prediction model in the presence of iac was more accurate in quantifying the cells because the predictions did not deviate significantly from the actual values figs 4a and s11a whereas the predictions from the model without iac fig 4b mostly overestimated the actual outcomes fig s11b also the significance of iac was further confirmed by the decreased root mean square error rmse 0 07 vs 0 48 fig s11 between the predictions and the actuals when compared to the prediction function without iac 2 log 10 n rdna k log 10 n cell b where k and b are slope and intercept of equation respectively log10 n rdna the log10 of rdna copy number n rdna estimated via calibration curves fig s6 is dependent variable log10 n cell the log10 of actual cell number n cell is independent variable 3 log 10 n cell log 10 n rdna b k where k and b are the predicted slope and intercept via regression model eq 2 respectively k 1 0082 b 1 3101 in prediction models of the presence of iac fig 4a k 1 0784 b 0 8906 in prediction models without iac fig 4b lo g 10 n cell is the predicted log10 of cell number by inserting the estimated n rdna into this prediction function relative to recombinant plasmid standards the purified genomic dna as iac to quantify loss is portable and inexpensive because the plasmid standards require the purchase of additional vectors and the construction of recombinant plasmids sales ortells et al 2015 however the naked dna e g genomic dna plasmid may not adequately represent the efficiency in the cellular lysis step which could underestimate losses in the extraction shi et al 2020 nevertheless the flaw in naked dna could be neglected if cell lysis is adequate in the present work the additional bead beating procedure in the map tg method can also ensure the sufficient lysis of cells fig s12 therefore the naked dna also meets the need for the accurate assessment of dna loss but only if the lysis step can be ensured to lyse cells adequately 3 4 quantification of p globosa solitary cells from simulated environmental water samples for qpcr assay cell number n cell was calculated using the following equation 4 n cell 10 log 10 n rdna b k where k and b are the slope and intercept of prediction function introducing iac respectively k 1 0082 b 1 3101 fig 4a log10 n rdna is the log10 of rdna copy number estimated via calibration curves fig s6 to validate the performance of the improved qpcr method we compare the specificity and accuracy of qpcr and ca fcm method by quantifying the simulated environmental samples containing the known number of solitary cells and non target species we concluded that i qpcr is more specific and accurate for detecting target cells as a significantly lower order of magnitude difference between expected and observed cell numbers compared to the ca fcm method fig 5 a c vs d f p 0 05 moreover a strong correlation r 0 997 p 0 001 fig 5g between the expected and observed cell numbers ranging 106 101 cells in magnitude and lower re value fig 5h p 0 05 further support the conclusion for the fcm method the high re value occurred in mainly the low density groups figs 5f and s13g i one possible explanation is that some non target algae were probably mistaken as p globosa when the target concentration was relatively low 1 and the fluorescence measurement parameters of selected non target cells morphology size are similar to the target cells ii both methods have comparable precision with no statistically significant difference in the cv p 0 17 fig 5i the reproducibility of the developed qpcr method was analyzed as cv mean value of quantifying target cells in all concentrations ranging from 1 5 106 to 2 101 cells l table s2 casabianca et al 2013 penna et al 2015 the least number of 20 cells could be quantified from a background of non target cells fig 5g with a low cv value in inter assay 22 fig 5i the mean cv value of 13 further supports the reproducibility furthermore the loq schwarz et al 2004 of p globosa solitary cells was estimated to be 45 cells corresponding to one cell per reaction fig s14 these results indicate that the qpcr method we developed has the potential for implementing accurate and robust early monitoring on p globosa solitary cells 3 5 dynamic variation of solitary cells and its relationship with bloom formation the abundance of solitary cells samples ranged from 2 9 102 to 2 4 106 cells l in the winter 2019 and from 2 6 101 to 4 7 105 cells l in the winter 2020 fig 6 a b the colonial bloom was also found in the winters in winter 2019 the colony formation was observed from january 18 2020 in five sites q1 q5 table s5a while in winter 2020 a few colonies initially appeared at two spots on november 22 2020 later the abundance of colonies increased at all sites on december 02 2020 table s5b it is noteworthy that the abundance of solitary cells declined before the bloom stage in both winters fig 6c d ranging from 2 61 102 to 1 27 103 cells l fig s15 however the decline in solitary cell abundance before the bloom stage has never been detected in previous field studies due to limitations in the sensitivity of monitoring methods for example in many field studies based on non qpcr methods the lowest detectable p globosa cell abundance was at the magnitude of 104 cells l table s6 in contrast our high sensitivity method can quantitatively detect a low abundance of cells down to 101 103 cells l and in addition with the method we discovered for the first time the plunge in solitary cell abundance before they bloom interestingly the dynamic variation rule of solitary cells before bloom conflicts with that of indoor experiment under conventional culture conditions nutrient light and temperature colony formation is a process accompanied by a continuous increase in solitary cell abundance liu et al 2021b zhang et al 2020 even under restrained growth conditions brussaard et al 2005 ren et al 2021 tang 2003 thus the plunge in solitary cell abundance before bloom observed in the field is more likely to be caused by other factors in fact earlier scene studies found that the p globosa colonies at the beginning of bloom attached to diatoms and suggested that diatoms could provide a solid substrate for colony formation rousseau et al 1994 sazhin et al 2007 furthermore in the known life history of p globosa in natural waters peperzak and gabler schwarz 2012 the colony formation involves several processes of i attachment of solitary cells to the solid substrate e g diatoms usually 20 µm ii morphological transformation from solitary to non solitary state iii formation of attached aggregate and iv colony construction therefore the plunge in solitary cell abundance before bloom could be due to solitary cells attachment to some substrates to form non solitary attached aggregate the basis of colony construction another observation worth noting was that neither such a plunge in solitary cell abundance nor colony appearance in q6 sites was observed in winter 2019 fig 6a table s5a but in winter of 2020 fig 6b after the plunge observed in 2020 numerous colonies burst into bloom table s5b therefore coupling with the above reasonable explanation for the plunge in abundance we believe that the bloom formation was strongly associated with the sharp decline in solitary cell abundance which could be considered an effective indicator to the bloom formation previous studies have used seawater viscosity kang et al 2020 characteristic pigment content wang et al 2021a and threshold of cell density 106 cells l ospar commission 2005 to forecast bloom appearance these indicators are usually observed only after colony formation as colonies can increase and expand rapidly veldhuis et al 2005 wang et al 2021b it could leave regulators with insufficient time to react this study provided an accurate prompt method and the high time sensitive indicator to forecast early the bloom outbreak and allow regulators to well curb the bloom e g spraying of clay yu et al 2017 4 conclusions this work emphasizes methodology development and application crucial conclusions are the accuracy of qpcr could be improved via the improvement of dna barcode design and dna extraction and the introduction of iac to control the loss our method provides a novel accurate and sensitive tool for monitoring early stage p globosa solitary cells by quantification estimation which has been a difficult task previously p globosa solitary cell abundance declined before the bloom stage this decline could be related to the formation of attached aggregate precursors of colonies by solitary cells attached to a solid matrix this new finding help reveal the mechanism of p globosa bloom in natural waters the plunge in solitary cell abundance may be used as a good indicator for the early warning of p globosa bloom which will promote the management and even the solution of the bloom problem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

15229,bifunctional photocatalytic nanofiltration pnf membrane is increasingly concerned in practical micro polluted water purification but there are still several bottlenecks that inhibit its practicality in this context the feasibility of a novel metal free and visible light responsive surface anchored pnf membrane for simultaneously removing target antibiotics in real sewage effluent in a continuous dynamic process was explored the results showed that the optimal pnf 4 membrane was expectedly consisted of an inside tight sub nanopore structured separation layer and an outside thinner smoother super hydrophilic mesoporous degradation layer respectively consequently the activated pnf 4 membrane could synergistically reduce trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole concentrations to below two orders of magnitude accompanying with almost constant high water permeability suggesting that the hydrophilic modification of the mesoporous degradation layer basically offsets its inherent hydraulic resistance also after repeating the fouling physical rinsing process three times lasted for 78 h only sporadic adherent contaminants remained onto the top surface together with the minimal total and irreversible fouling ratios as low as 7 2 and 1 2 respectively strongly demonstrated that pnf 4 membrane displayed good self cleaning performance undoubtedly this will significantly reduce its potential cleaning frequency and maintenance cost in long term operation meanwhile the acute and chronic biotoxicities of its permeate to virbrio qinghaiensis sp 67 were also reduced sharply to 2 22 and 0 45 respectively all of these evidences suggest that the dual functions of pnf 4 membrane are synergetic in an uninterrupted permeating process it will provide useful insights for continuously enhancing the practicality and effectiveness of pnf membrane in actual micro polluted water purification scenarios graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ncqds modified carbon nitride

membranes presented in polymer based carbon based ceramic based and metal based species offer the most feasible and cost effective solution to this immense challenge garcia ivars et al 2017 dong et al

of foulants onto into membrane matrices during the permeation process niu et al 2022 song et al 2021a the inability to eliminate toxic pollutants membrane fouling and relatively high energy

al 2020 zhang et al 2020 this is mainly manifested in the fact that in addition to inheriting its precursors inherent skills e g capable of decomposing mineralizing toxic target pollutants the bifunctional pnf membrane also surprisingly attains photocatalyst recovery and continuity of operation active fouling mitigation or rather self cleaning cumulative synchronous removal etc kumari et al 2020 lotfi et al 2022 early pnf membrane reactors usually simply suspended the photocatalyst into the wastewater medium resulting in a sharp reduction in the service life of the polymeric membrane due to the attack of active free radicals phoon et al 2020 zhu et al 2022 therefore some scholars began to replace polymeric membrane with ceramic materials due to high chemical stability and adapting for harsh applications in contrast researches on constructing pnf membrane by immobilizing photocatalyst on in the membrane surface are increasingly favored by the academic communities most recently visible light responsive pnf membranes mainly including metal or nonmetal doped tio2 zno based hoseini et al 2017 zangeneh et al 2019 feooh based lv et al 2017 and graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 based zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 are increasingly concerned because of their more fully utilization of solar light while avoiding the damage of polymeric membranes induced by ultraviolet irradiation shi et al pointed that activated pnf membrane under visible light represented the future development trend and better met the large scale applicable requirement shi et al 2019a from the perspective of the photocatalyst immobilizing pattern pnf membrane might also be divided into two categories blended into the separation layer and coated onto its surface as far as the former was concerned it was mostly prepared by a simple phase inversion method with thickness between several hundred and several thousand nanometers resulting most photocatalysts only ineffectively doped into the middle and bottom polymeric matrix where visible light cannot penetrate through shi et al 2019b meanwhile although the blended pnf membrane reduced the possibility of photocatalyst leaching those easily agglomerated nanoparticles spread into the polymeric body exacerbated the structural defects of pnf membrane itself and the substrate to be degraded was also difficult to access the catalytic sites zhang et al 2020a in order to avoid the defects of the integration of bifunctional layers the mainstream visible light responsive pnf membranes were fabricated with the polymeric separation layer as the carrier closely followed by the outer surface anchoring mesoporous photocatalytic degradation layer via atomic layer deposition dip coating and vacuum filtration etc lan et al 2019 li et al 2019 moreover the problem of insufficient adhesion of photocatalysts onto polymeric membrane surface has been basically solved by means of pre coating biomimetic adhesive shao et al 2020 in situ mineralization lv et al 2017 or aldol condensation crosslinking wang et al 2020 zhang et al pointed out that pnf membrane assembled with non toxic stable and nonmetal g c3n4 based visible light photocatalyst achieved rapid development and exhibited good synergistic removal self cleaning and antibacterial activities for various dyes antibiotics and endocrine disruptors in water purification zhang et al 2021 however there are still some issues challenges for the known surface anchored visible light responsive pnf membranes that need to be addressed while continuing to improve their usability and effectiveness for one thing the performance testing of these pnf membranes usually adopted ex situ or static coupling process that is it only involved the simple integration of photocatalytic device and nanofiltration membrane module into a large reactor or the fouled membrane was taken off followed by illumination alone kumari et al 2020 in other words these operational steps of photocatalytic degradation and membrane separation were not performed under conditions where light driven and pressure driven acted simultaneously of course a few current studies have made progress in similar scenarios for instance lotfi et al customized a dynamic performance evaluator to allow continuous flow through operation under uv irradiation and achieved efficient degradation of steroid hormone micropollutants using photocatalytic microfiltration membrane lotfi et al 2022 for the other thing when removing target pollutants photocatalysis requires an effective reaction time about 15 120 min while membrane separation is accomplished within a short contact time which brings about a non negligible disturbance to realizing the energy saving of pnf membrane anyway these demands pose new challenges in terms of design and operation mode for pnf membrane performance evaluation instrument in addition most studies merely involved simulated feedwater or simple influent matrix ignoring the solute solute interaction and its effect occurring in the to be removed stage in practical water environment jiang et al 2016 finally to ensure the safety of purified water biotoxicity testing is also required to assess the associated health risk mitigation effect deng et al 2019 du et al 2017 in light of the above this study aims to explore the feasibility of bifunctional pnf membrane for simultaneously degrading and separating target antibiotics in sewage effluent in a continuous dynamic process firstly with a polyethylenimine pei based polyamide separation layer incorporating 0d quaternized carbon quantum dots qcds as the carrier a novel metal free and visible light responsive n doped carbon quantum dots ncqds modified g c3n4 surface anchored pnf membrane was fabricated by dip coating assisted vacuum filtration technique secondly their structure and properties of the relevant degradable and separating functional layers were exhaustively characterized finally the simultaneous removal self cleaning performances and environmental risk reduction characteristics of the resultant pnf membrane and its counterparts were systematically investigated in a continuous flow through process under visible light exposure it will provide useful insights for further improving the practicality and effectiveness of pnf membrane in real micro polluted water purification scenarios 2 experimental 2 1 materials and reagents one self made polysulfone hollow fiber uf membrane module with molecular weight cut off mwco of 40 kda and an effective surface area of 0 03 m2 was adopted for stringent pretreatment commercial polyethersulfone flat sheet substrate mwco 50 kda with pure water permeability of 136 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was obtained from risingsun membrane company beijing china urea citric acid monohydrate trimesoyl chloride tmc 98 0 pei 50 0 solution sodium dodecyl sulfate sds n hexane ethanol absolute dopamine hydrochloride da triethylenetetramine teta and na2co3 were all purchased from macklin china used to prepare pnf membrane other auxiliary reagents including tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris 99 8 betaine hydrochloride 99 0 isopropanol alcohol acetone and fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer i as well as high purity methanol 99 9 were supplied by aladdin china both frequently detected antibiotics with small molecular weights 300 da but markedly different physicochemical characteristics see table s1 comprising trimethoprim tmp and sulfamethoxazole smx were bought from tokyo chemical industry co ltd japan as target microcontaminants in this study the freeze dried virbrio qinghaiensis sp 67 q67 was ordered from hamamatsu beijing china ar grade reagents and deionized di water 1 9 μs cm 1 were used throughout the process unless specifically stated otherwise the simulated influent of pnf membrane was simply formed by spiking both target antibiotics together into milli q water 0 049 μs cm 1 with the aid of chromatographically pure methanol to achieve a fixed content of 1000 μg l 1 for each as for its real feedwater the secondary effluent after disinfection sampled from xiaoshangzhuang sewage treatment plant in xinxiang city its critical properties presented the first column in table 1 was pretreated by the aforementioned polysulfone uf module operated in a dead end mode to meet the requirements of the feedwater for subsequent permeable membrane then the selected antibiotics were added according to the scheme of configuring the simulated influent in the presence of multiple background matrices 2 2 synthesis of hnccns and fabrication of pnf membranes ncqds precursor was synthesized via a modified hydrothermal method wang et al 2017 and its structural formula was shown in fig s1 briefly 9 g citric acid and 3 g urea were mixed thoroughly in an appropriate amount of di water then the mixture was transferred to a teflon sealed autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 180 c for 5 h afterwards it was naturally cooled to room temperature and the reaped tan suspension was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min to remove impurities hereafter the gained 50 μl ncqds stock solution and 10 g urea were mixed into 40 ml di water to form a transparent solution accompanying by drying at 70 c for 24 h subsequently the resulting brown solid was heated to 550 c for 3 h at a heating rate of 15 c min 1 to obtain ncqds modified carbon nitride nccn as a synthetic intermediate liu et al 2019 finally the photocatalysts made by the high temperature secondary calcination at 550 c involving a heating rate of 5 c min 1 with different time 2 h 4 h 6 h were denoted as hnccn 2 hnccn 4 and hnccn 6 respectively in addition pure g c3n4 was prepared following the same synthetic route in the absence of ncqds and secondary calcination the schematic diagram of pnf membrane fabrication is illustrated in fig 1 primarily the pei based polyamide matrix incorporated with an appropriate amount of qcds as a separation functional layer was loaded onto the polyethersulfone substrate surface by interfacial polymerization referred to as nf qcds membrane song et al 2021b thereinto qcds was prepared by a one step pyrolysis using betaine hydrochloride and tris as raw materials on the basis of previous study bourlinos et al 2011 subsequently the degradation functional layer was anchored onto the top surface of the resultant nanocomposite membrane by polydopamine pda dip coating assisted vacuum filtration technique specifically this nanocomposite membrane was firstly immersed into a 2 g l 1 da solution containing 50 mm tris hcl buffer ph 8 5 and shaken at 25 c for 6 h as an adhesive between bifunctional layers next it was washed immediately by ethanol to eliminate the excess unreacted pda simultaneously an appropriate amount of the optimal hnccn 4 photocatalyst see fig s2 was dissolved in a mixture of water and ethanol with a certain volume ratio and then sonicated for 30 min afterwards 40 ml of the ten fold diluted supernatant was taken out doped with a certain concentration of teta as crosslinker and then vacuum filtrated through the above mentioned membrane top surface at 25 c finally the gained pnf membranes were baked at 60 c for 20 min and stored in di water for later use it should be stated that 4 6 40 mg l 1 and 0 1 wt were identified as the optimal volume ratio content of hnccn 4 and teta respectively according to their supernatant absorbance huang et al 2019 and removal performance orthogonal experimental results see figs s 3 and 4 incidentally the optimal bifunctional membrane prepared was denoted to be pnf 4 2 3 laboratory scale experimental set up a custom built integrated pnf membrane performance testing equipment was compactly placed in a photochemical reaction box cel lb70 ceaulight beijing as schematically shown in fig 2 its main components included a feedwater tank diving pump pressure gauge circular quartz membrane test cell with an effective area of 21 2 cm2 and permeate tank thereinto the membrane test cell adopted the flow direction from top to bottom so as to allow pnf membrane top surface to receive light radiation directly from a cross sectional point of view the cover of the membrane test cell with a total thickness of 2 5 cm consisted of a lower flow channel with a cavity thickness of merely 0 14 cm and an upper concentric circular condensation channel with a cavity thickness of 0 8 cm during the experiment iced water was continuously flowed through the condensing device by a peristaltic pump at the required rate so as to help pnf feedwater temperature to be maintained at 25 c all the time besides a 300 w xenon lamp cel pe300 ceaulight beijing with a 400 nm ultraviolet cutoff filter was placed directly above the test cell at a distance of 15 cm from the membrane surface the pnf apparatus was run on a semi closed loop mode with the retentate stream fully recycling back to the feedwater tank this made it feasible to precisely tune the degradation time of bifunctional pnf membrane under the situations of continuous flow through in situ and synchronization 2 4 experimental protocol before the removal performance test pnf membrane coupon was compacted at 4 bar for 2 h to reach a stable state flux then prior to light irradiation 2 l simulated or real influent was circulated inside the evaluator for 30 min at 1 bar to achieve the adsorption desorption equilibrium between the photocatalytic functional layer surface and target antibiotics liu et al 2020 subsequently the formal removal performance test of bifunctional pnf membrane integrating degradation and separation under the conditions of dynamic in situ and simultaneous occurrence on target antibiotics was carried out exposed to light at 6 bar lasted for 2 h finally 50 ml influent and permeate samples were collected and rapidly filtered through a 0 45 μm filter for measurement as control trials additional pnf 4 and nf qcds membrane coupons were also tested in the same way under darkness besides 3 cycle fouling and associated rinsing experiments were conducted under the same initial operating conditions as the removal performance test and only real influent with a high fouling propensity was involved every cycle comprised two steps 1 test ran for 24 h and the final membrane flux j f n n 1 2 3 was gained 2 physical cleaning with 300 ml di water lasted for 30 min and the recovered pure water flux j p n n 1 2 3 was measured corresponding fouling indexes including the flux recovery ratio frr total fouling ratio r t and irreversible fouling ratio r ir were calculated in accordance with the previous work liu et al 2020 besides water permeability l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was measured indirectly by weighing the mass of permeate at specified time intervals rejection of each phac component was obtained by the percentage of dividing the rejected concentration by the content in feed mutharasi et al 2020 2 5 characterization surface chemical components wettabilities roughnesses and surface cross sectional morphologies of both nf and pnf membranes were determined by atr ftir nexus usa xps escalab 250xi usa goniometer theta finland afm multimode 8 usa and fe sem jsm 6390lv japan respectively the thickness and distribution of proteins deposited onto the fouled rinsed membrane skin layers with the assistance of fluorescence dye were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm tcs sp8 mp germany as for their precursors the chemical structure elemental compositions surface morphologies and wettabilities of the relevant photocatalysts were also determined by the aforementioned atr ftir xps sem eds and contact angle analyzer respectively in addition the crystal structure pore

dilution multiple gb 11903 89 and nessler s reagent colorimetric methods respectively concentrations of target antibiotics were detected by a liquid chromatographic instrument alliance e2695 waters singapore the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3deem fluorescence spectra of wastewater samples were measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer fp 6500 jasco japan electron paramagnetic resonance epr bruker germany and radical scavenging tests were performed in order to identify the potential active species in the degradation the degradation intermediates of smx and tmp were detected by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms agilent usa 2 6 environmental risk and toxicity assessments to examine the safety of the as fabricated bifunctional pnf membrane for the efficient removal of target small sized antibiotics the risk quotient rq of each residual antibiotic in pnf permeate and its counterpart was calculated through eq 1 1 r q m e c a f e c 50 where mec is the measured environmental content af is a safety factor of 1000 and 100 for acute and chronic toxicity and ec50 is median effect concentration meanwhile the bioluminescence inhibition of q67 in the real secondary effluent before and after the resultant nf pnf membrane treatment was measured to investigate the toxicity reduction effect details of bacterial culture and acute chronic toxicity test were in accordance with the reported literature zhou et al 2010 the toxicity of nf qcds pnf 4 influent effluent sample on q67 was expressed as the inhibition rate e and calculated according to eq 2 2 e i 0 i i 0 100 where i0 and i present the average relative light unit of q67 exposed to the control and test substance 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of pnf membrane bifunctional layers the physicochemical crystal structure chemical environment specific surface area wettability and optical properties of the synthesized photocatalysts were characterized as shown in fig 3 it could be seen from fig 3a that all three photocatalyst samples were observed to have similar characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ 27 7 and 13 1 by xrd pattern thereinto the strong diffraction peak at 2θ 27 7 was indexed to the 002 crystal plane structure of g c3n4 jcpds no 87 1526 due to the periodic stacking of the conjugated aromatic system li et al 2016 while the weaker diffraction peak at 2θ 13 1 was assigned to 100 plane originated from the in planar arrangement of tri s triazine units besides compared with g c3n4 the xrd pattern of hnccn 4 was almost unchanged after successive modification by incorporating low amount of ncqds and secondary thermal oxidation indicating that hnccn 4 photocatalyst well inherits the inherent crystal structure of its precursor of course this is also inseparable from the low crystallinity and relatively small amount 1 wt of ncqds fig 3b shows atr ftir spectra of the as prepared photocatalysts strong absorption bands at 1000 1700 cm 1 were assigned to c n stretching vibrations in the cn heterocycles a sharp band at 806 cm 1 resulted from the breathing vibration pattern of s triazine unit while the wide bands at 3000 3400 cm 1 corresponded to the free amino and surface adsorbed hydroxyl groups compared with the spectra of pure g c3n4 and nccn a new absorption peak at 1680 cm 1 was detected in the spectrum of hnccn 4 which corresponds to c o stretching vibration in the amide bond verifying that the formation of covalent bonds between ncqds and urea derived g c3n4 through amide reaction after high temperature secondary calcination wang et al 2018 in addition these samples were further analyzed using xps to obtain the exact elemental content xps spectra fig 3c showed that the o content of g c3n4 was only 0 36 while that of nccn and hnccn 4 increased to 1 02 and 3 63 respectively this phenomenon may be due to the addition of ncqds riched in oxygen during the process of high temperature secondary calcination moreover the curve fitted high resolution scans for c 1s and n 1s of g c3n4 nccn and hnccn 4 samples depicted in fig s5 further verified our interpretation about atr ftir spectra pore size distribution and bet surface area were estimated by nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms as shown in fig 3d and table s2 clearly all samples showed typical iv a isotherm trend indicating that these photocatalysts are mesoporous materials more specifically hnccn 4 has the largest bet surface area as high as 177 8 m2 g 1 which is 2 32 times than that of unmodified g c3n4 hnccn 4 inherited its precursor mesoporous structure significantly larger than the sub nanopore structure of the corresponding separation layer and exhibited a higher pore volume and specific surface area which obviously endow the degradation functional layer of pnf 4 membrane with negligible hydraulic resistance and promising photocatalytic activity liu et al 2017 furthermore fe sem images and eds mapping of g c3n4 nccn and hnccn 4 see fig s6 also more intuitively confirmed the changing trend of their increasingly hollowed out 2d lamellar structure and successful modification vb xps uv vis drs and pl spectra were used to characterize the band structure and optical absorption capacities of g c3n4 nccn and hnccn 4 samples as shown in fig 3 e h the vb values of g c3n4 nccn and hnccn 4 were 1 85 ev 2 19 ev and 2 12 ev respectively compared with pure g c3n4 hnccn 4 exhibited broader absorption in the visible light region indicating that the incorporation of ncqds enhanced visible light utilization ability the band gap eg calculated by previous works bourlinos et al 2011 ni et al 2021 of hnccn 4 2 83 ev was slightly lower than that of g c3n4 2 86 ev and nccn 2 88 ev manifesting that only the participation of the high temperature secondary calcination could cause a mild reduction in the hybridization bandgap pl spectra showed that the emission peak intensity of hnccn 4 was significantly lower than that of g c3n4 or other counterparts indicating that the introduction of ncqds could effectively inhibit the recombination of photoexcited electron hole pairs both the red shift of visible light absorption edge and the remarkable suppression of charge carriers will eventually boost the photocatalytic activity of hnccn 4 ou yang et al 2021 in addition it can be seen from fig 3i that the static water contact angle ca detected at 10 s of hnccn 4 was 26 85º which was significantly lower than that of g c3n4 38 71º they are far superior to the hydrophilicity of the polymeric skin layer song et al 2021b which is bound to contribute to reducing the mass transfer resistance of water molecules and increasing the adhesion of the resultant pnf membrane top surface cross sectional chemical compositions wettabilities and morphologies of bifunctional layers of pnf 4 membrane were systematically characterized by atr ftir and xps spectra water ca sem and afm as shown in fig 4 compared with the spectrum of pes substrate two new absorption peaks of nf qcds membrane at 2927 cm 1 and 2854 cm 1 displayed in fig 4a could be ascribed to the stretching vibrations of excess primary and secondary amine groups from pei based polyamide matrix respectively song et al 2021b meanwhile except for a characteristic peak similar to nf qcds membrane observed at 2854 cm 1 there was no significant difference in the atr ftir spectra between pnf 4 membrane skin layer and hnccn 4 indicating that hnccn 4 photocatalyst was indeed successfully anchored onto pnf 4 membrane surface uniformly similarly xps results further confirmed the above speculation this was mainly reflected in the fact that the separation functional layer 5 1 1 exhibited the c n o atomic content ratio of the classical pei based polyamide while the degradation functional layer 14 11 1 had almost the same elemental ratio as the hnccn 4 photocatalyst 12 15 1 see fig 3c it was worth noting from fig 4c that water ca at 10 s decreased dramatically from 43 75º of nf qcds membrane to 29 05º of pnf 4 membrane again very close to the data of hnccn 4 sample indicating that pnf 4 membrane top surface is super hydrophilic as shown in fig 4d the fe sem topographic feature changed from ridge and valley structure for nf qcds membrane to relatively smooth surface for pnf 4 membrane which was qualitatively consistent with the 3d afm data in detail the root mean square roughness rms of pnf 4 membrane decreased from 9 34 0 35 nm of nf qcds membrane to 6 19 0 27 nm presumably due to the optimization of 2d nanosheet structured photocatalytic functional layer meanwhile the thickness of bifunctional layers restrainedly increased from 118 nm of the separation layer to 154 nm which indicated that the degradation functional layer made up of hnccn 4 photocatalyst surface anchored onto pnf membrane was only about 30 nm it is basically consistent with the eds mapping image depicted in fig s7 considering its mesoporous structure and super hydrophilic mentioned above it is conceivable that the additional hydraulic longitudinal resistance brought by the degradation functional layer could be tolerated to a certain extent taken together these desired structure and properties including the outside thinner smoother super hydrophilic mesoporous efficient degradation functional layer as well as the inside tight sub nanopore structured separation functional layer are bound to endow pnf 4 membrane with excellent simultaneous removal performance for target antibiotics in actual effluent 3 2 simultaneous removal performance of pnf membrane the removal performance of bifunctional pnf 4 membrane to target antibiotics was evaluated by measuring the permeability and removal rate involving both simulated and real feedwaters in a continuous flow through process under illumination as presented in figs 5 and 6 the removing data of it and nf qcds membrane loaded with only separation functional layer under dark condition are also plotted in fig 5 for comparison to quantify the contributions of the respective functional layers overall the remove rate sequences for selected antibiotics of three schemes were in the order of pnf 4 light pnf 4 dark nf qcds whether for simulated or real feedwater for instance in the case of simulated feedwater the removal rates against tmp and smx by pnf 4 light membrane were 99 4 and 99 1 respectively which were significantly higher than those by pnf 4 dark membrane 95 6 and 94 1 let alone nf qcds membrane 95 3 and 93 2 this clearly proves that bifunctional pnf 4 membrane could synergistically and efficiently reduce target antibiotics concentrations in the feedwater to below two orders of magnitude compared to the sole sub nanopore separation layer while the slight advantage of pnf 4 dark membrane is likely due to the adsorption of selected micropollutants by the hnccn 4 photocatalytic layer it was also found that the water permeability of pnf 4 23 64 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 after experiencing a slight decrease in darkness recovered to almost the same high level as that of unmodified nf qcds 23 78 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 membrane under irradiation this indicates that the mesoporous hnccn 4 photocatalyst anchored onto nf qcds membrane surface with a thickness of several tens of nanometers and the resultant pnf membrane hydrophilic modification might basically offset its own inherent hydraulic resistance wang et al 2021 especially when the activated degradation layer works in situ and synchronously the removal rate of positively charged tmp with relatively large steric hindrance was always higher than that of negatively charged smx in all schemes and this gap was compromised sharply for pnf 4 light membrane this may be due to the weakening of surface positive charge after nf qcds membrane modification it was also found that the removal rates of both selected antibiotics in practical water environment were always higher than those in ideal water environment especially in the scheme of nf qcds this is mainly due to the fact that apart from the freely dissolved state antibiotics in the actual sewage effluent also occurred in the forms of large sized dissolved organic matter dom associated and particle 0 45 μm associated states under the microscopic solute solute interaction lin et al 2021 undoubtedly the latter two species will effectively increase the steric hindrance of target antibiotics zhang et al 2022 thereby improving their apparent removal rates in terms of the degradation layer the dissolved organics in influent matrices could scavenge radicals and or block light penetration thus affecting the effectiveness of the degradable functional layer for the transformation of target antibiotics but the presence of such abundant electron rich background matrices would also enhance the formation and reactivity of useful radicals for elimination and alter the transformation pathways of selected micropollutants yang et al 2022 in order to clarify the evolution of categories during the removal of organics in real micro polluted sewage effluent by bifunctional pnf 4 membrane under the background of solute solute interaction the relevant 3deem spectra of the feed product samples were characterized as presented in fig 6 the secondary effluent was mainly rich in humic substances sited in regions iii and v several soluble microbial metabolites located in region iv and aromatic proteins sited in region ii ly et al 2018 truong et al 2020 but after adding trace amounts of target antibiotics the fluorescence characteristic peaks were all blue shifted accompanying the increasing intensity except for humic acids located in region v presumably due to the solute solute interaction between those antibiotics containing protein like structure see table s1 with the residual natural endogenous soluble organics assisted by the bridging effect of di multi valent cations wang et al 2016 from fig 6 c e it could be seen that there were sporadic fluorescence response signals in the permeate samples in both nf qcds and pnf 4 dark schemes while it magically presented a signal that was almost impossible to discover and very close to zero in pnf 4 light scheme to a certain extent this confirms the previously mentioned synergistic and efficient removal of target antibiotics by bifunctional pnf 4 membrane in a continuous flow through process under illumination 3 3 self cleaning performance of pnf membrane in general the antiadhesion membranes are expected to be fabricated by fit for purpose modification to weaken the interaction forces between the foulants and the membrane surface wang et al 2022 different from this one of the fascinating advantages of pnf membranes in service is that the deposited foulants could be photo degraded destroyed or even almost completely eliminated actively and simultaneously with the assistance of the outer photocatalytic functional layer shi et al 2019a for this purpose the stabilities in self cleaning performance of the resultant pnf 4 membrane and its counterparts tested with practical water were evaluated as shown in fig 7 it was discovered from fig 7a that after running for 24 h the normalized fluxes of nf qcds membrane pnf 4 membrane under darkness and illumination decreased by 8 8 10 and 3 6 respectively then after physical flushing with di water for 0 5 h permeabilities of these involved membranes recovered to 97 2 97 9 and 99 5 of their initial values respectively after repeating this fouling physical rinsing process three times the final r t and r ir see fig 7b decreased significantly from 17 3 and 8 2 18 7 and 7 5 of both nf qcds membrane and pnf 4 membrane without light irradiation to 7 2 and 1 2 of the latter one under visible light exposure undoubtedly pnf 4 membrane irradiated via visible light demonstrated impressive fouling resistance or more precisely self cleaning performance in a continuous flow through process especially featured in a very minor irreversible fouling rate the superior self cleaning property of pnf 4 membrane may be attributed to the enhanced antibiotic adsorption capacity promoted light harvesting ability and fast transfer of photo generated electrons at the outer degradation functional layer surface after combining figs s 8 and 9 it could be inferred target antibiotics are firstly degraded by the reactive oxygen species including oh and o2 generated by the outer photocatalytic layer before being further separated by the inner nanocomposite membrane as for the other two schemes with inferior anti fouling performance it was interestingly found that under darkness compared with nf qcds separating membrane the bifunctional pnf 4 membrane showed slightly lager flux decline ratio and r t but relatively lower r ir this may be due to the mutual compromise for the latter between the greatly increasing tendency to trap contaminants inside the extra mesoporous photocatalytic layer transport channels and the concurrently improved membrane surface hydrophilicity smoothness see fig 4c and f clsm and water ca were employed to further verify the above conjecture from other observational perspectives at the end of the fouling physical flushing test thereinto the former could accurately represent the spatial distribution of target antibiotics and other background matrices in secondary effluent with protein like structure mixed in the foulant layer it can be seen from fig 8 that the fouled pnf 4 membrane under darkness manifested the highest protein coverage ratio among three modes and thicker foulant layer substructure over 3 0 μm than that irradiated by visible light however the fouling layer thicknesses of all rinsed membranes were significantly differentiated that is following the order of nf qcds pnf 4 dark pnf 4 light from the perspective of the fluorescence intensity the above mentioned viewpoint will be further confirmed this is especially reflected in the fact that after the continuous flow through under irradiation the rinsed pnf 4 membrane surface only remains sporadic adherent contaminants these evidences together with the similar results of hydrophobicity incremental changes which are highly consistent with the macroscopic fouling resistance index again strongly demonstrate that pnf 4 membrane under visible light irradiation displays good self cleaning performance in a long running process especially when coupled with an inexpensive physical flushing step besides the relevant experimental data were comprehensively collected in table 2 used for the performance comparison with other state of the art catalytic membranes in current literatures for contaminants removal it was clear that the pnf 4 membrane prepared in this study had higher removal and adhesive capacities than most of its counterparts which further supports these viewpoints 3 4 environmental risk reduction performance rqs of both target antibiotics in the permeate samples in nf qcds pnf 4 dark and pnf 4 light schemes were evaluated based on their most sensitive ec 50 values in practical water environment as listed in fig 9 it can be seen that the rq values of tmp and smx were lower than 0 1 in all cases indicating that neither nf qcds nor pnf 4 product water has ecological risk to aquatic organisms li et al 2021 it s important to note that the rq values of tmp and smx of pnf 4 membrane irradiated via visible light were even as low as 6 28 10 4 and 2 76 10 4 respectively far below the low risk threshold the results demonstrated that the activated bifunctional pnf 4 membrane in a continuous flow through pattern could be used as an efficient and reliable tool to prevent or even eliminate further migration of target antibiotics in aquatic environment moreover the acute and chronic toxicities of the real feedwater namely sewage effluent meeting the national grade i a discharge standard and permeate samples in all schemes were evaluated by the luminescence inhibition rate of vibrio qinghaiensis sp q67 as shown in fig 10 clearly there were many significant changes in inhibition rate between the raw sewage effluent and all treated permeates for both the 0 25 h and 12 h tests to be more specific the actual feedwater sample still possessed non negligible inhibition ratio of 23 7 and 9 96 after 0 25 and 12 h of exposure respectively thus indeed requiring an in depth processing step that will act as a barrier while it was surprisingly found that the two indices of bifunctional pnf 4 membrane irradiated via visible light were as low as 2 22 and 0 45 respectively reducing by more than an order of magnitude when compared to its mother solution besides combined with the blank test results obtained from other two patterns it could be deduced that the dense nanocomposite separation layer provides greater contribution in terms of reducing feedwater toxicity than that of the hnccn 4 degradation layer especially for the acute one of course the activated outer photocatalytic functional layer showed an apparent continuous positive elimination suggesting that the transformation products induced less toxic effects than the native compounds in brief the resultant surface anchored pnf 4 membrane as a single step exhibited the outstanding capability of both removing target antibiotics and reducing the biotoxicity stemming from sewage effluent in a continuous flow through process under visible light exposure 4 conclusion in this research a novel metal free and visible light responsive n doped cqds modified g c3n4 surface anchored pnf membrane was fabricated and employed for simultaneously removing trace antibiotics in sewage effluent under the situation of continuous flow through the experimental results illustrated that different from its inside dense physical separation layer the outside super hydrophilic mesoporous degradation layer of bifunctional pnf 4 membrane displayed a negligible hydraulic resistance and better photocatalytic activity in the operation mode of flat sheet membrane module adopting a top down flow direction and semi closed loop both impressively simultaneous removal self cleaning performances and outstanding environmental risk reduction capacity of the resultant pnf 4 membrane were fulfilled under the conditions of dynamic in situ and visible light exposure more precisely bifunctional pnf 4 membrane could efficiently reduce tmp and smx concentrations to below two orders of magnitude whether for simulated or real feedwater accompanying with almost constant high water permeability of 23 64 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the fouled pnf 4 membrane irradiated by visible light manifested the lowest foulant coverage ratio among three modes and thinner foulant layer substructure over 3 0 μm than that under darkness meanwhile only sporadic adherent contaminants remained onto the rinsed pnf 4 light membrane surface moreover it was capable of sharply reducing the acute and chronic biotoxicities of raw sewage effluent to virbrio qinghaiensis sp 67 to 2 22 and 0 45 respectively as a single unit operated in a continuous flow through process its simultaneous removal self cleaning and environmental risk reduction performances on real sewage effluent are a contribution to the domain of water purification by pnf membrane the future work should be paid attention to strengthening the degradation capacity of surface anchored photocatalytic layer and expanding its adaptability to more target micro pollutants declaration of competing interest

15229,bifunctional photocatalytic nanofiltration pnf membrane is increasingly concerned in practical micro polluted water purification but there are still several bottlenecks that inhibit its practicality in this context the feasibility of a novel metal free and visible light responsive surface anchored pnf membrane for simultaneously removing target antibiotics in real sewage effluent in a continuous dynamic process was explored the results showed that the optimal pnf 4 membrane was expectedly consisted of an inside tight sub nanopore structured separation layer and an outside thinner smoother super hydrophilic mesoporous degradation layer respectively consequently the activated pnf 4 membrane could synergistically reduce trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole concentrations to below two orders of magnitude accompanying with almost constant high water permeability suggesting that the hydrophilic modification of the mesoporous degradation layer basically offsets its inherent hydraulic resistance also after repeating the fouling physical rinsing process three times lasted for 78 h only sporadic adherent contaminants remained onto the top surface together with the minimal total and irreversible fouling ratios as low as 7 2 and 1 2 respectively strongly demonstrated that pnf 4 membrane displayed good self cleaning performance undoubtedly this will significantly reduce its potential cleaning frequency and maintenance cost in long term operation meanwhile the acute and chronic biotoxicities of its permeate to virbrio qinghaiensis sp 67 were also reduced sharply to 2 22 and 0 45 respectively all of these evidences suggest that the dual functions of pnf 4 membrane are synergetic in an uninterrupted permeating process it will provide useful insights for continuously enhancing the practicality and effectiveness of pnf membrane in actual micro polluted water purification scenarios graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ncqds modified carbon nitride photocatalytic nanofiltration membrane antibiotics sewage effluent dynamically synchronous removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction precise removal of emerging trace level organic contaminants with low molecular weights typically below 1 kda especially as represented by the progressively increasing and biorefractory antibiotics in the effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants has become one of the hot environmental issues worldwide khasawneh and palaniandy 2021 tran et al 2018 usually membrane treatment is considered as the ultimate removal option of approach nasrollahi et al 2022 phoon et al 2020 numerous ultrafiltration uf often appearing in the form of hybridization with other techniques nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis requiring high pressure processes have been reported to remove antibiotics under different feed components synthetic or real ph and operating conditions these studies were mainly devoted to elucidating the separation mechanism of the virgin fouled membranes and improving the filtration and antifouling effect by contrast based on its sub nanoscale confined pore spaces and tunable surface charge nf membranes presented in polymer based carbon based ceramic based and metal based species offer the most feasible and cost effective solution to this immense challenge garcia ivars et al 2017 dong et al 2022 yuan et al 2020 however owing to only involving the outstanding separation with non destructive property by selectively restricting component movement and the associated attachment accumulation of foulants onto into membrane matrices during the permeation process niu et al 2022 song et al 2021a the inability to eliminate toxic pollutants membrane fouling and relatively high energy consumption are still the nerve racking technical bottlenecks that hinder its wide application in practical wastewater scenarios thus advances in multifunctional nf membranes through the structural tailoring and the introduction of immobilized functional layers such as coupling with biocatalysis costa et al 2019 taheran et al 2017 electrocatalysis ren et al 2022 and photocatalysis shi et al 2019a zhang et al 2021 are having tremendous scientific and technical impacts in the fields of wastewater advanced treatment and toxicity control thereinto photocatalytic nanofiltration pnf membrane as one of the most concerned options which integrates the sub nanoscale physical separation and chemical decontamination into a single unit could take advantage of the synergy of both techniques xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 this is mainly manifested in the fact that in addition to inheriting its precursors inherent skills e g capable of decomposing mineralizing toxic target pollutants the bifunctional pnf membrane also surprisingly attains photocatalyst recovery and continuity of operation active fouling mitigation or rather self cleaning cumulative synchronous removal etc kumari et al 2020 lotfi et al 2022 early pnf membrane reactors usually simply suspended the photocatalyst into the wastewater medium resulting in a sharp reduction in the service life of the polymeric membrane due to the attack of active free radicals phoon et al 2020 zhu et al 2022 therefore some scholars began to replace polymeric membrane with ceramic materials due to high chemical stability and adapting for harsh applications in contrast researches on constructing pnf membrane by immobilizing photocatalyst on in the membrane surface are increasingly favored by the academic communities most recently visible light responsive pnf membranes mainly including metal or nonmetal doped tio2 zno based hoseini et al 2017 zangeneh et al 2019 feooh based lv et al 2017 and graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 based zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 are increasingly concerned because of their more fully utilization of solar light while avoiding the damage of polymeric membranes induced by ultraviolet irradiation shi et al pointed that activated pnf membrane under visible light represented the future development trend and better met the large scale applicable requirement shi et al 2019a from the perspective of the photocatalyst immobilizing pattern pnf membrane might also be divided into two categories blended into the separation layer and coated onto its surface as far as the former was concerned it was mostly prepared by a simple phase inversion method with thickness between several hundred and several thousand nanometers resulting most photocatalysts only ineffectively doped into the middle and bottom polymeric matrix where visible light cannot penetrate through shi et al 2019b meanwhile although the blended pnf membrane reduced the possibility of photocatalyst leaching those easily agglomerated nanoparticles spread into the polymeric body exacerbated the structural defects of pnf membrane itself and the substrate to be degraded was also difficult to access the catalytic sites zhang et al 2020a in order to avoid the defects of the integration of bifunctional layers the mainstream visible light responsive pnf membranes were fabricated with the polymeric separation layer as the carrier closely followed by the outer surface anchoring mesoporous photocatalytic degradation layer via atomic layer deposition dip coating and vacuum filtration etc lan et al 2019 li et al 2019 moreover the problem of insufficient adhesion of photocatalysts onto polymeric membrane surface has been basically solved by means of pre coating biomimetic adhesive shao et al 2020 in situ mineralization lv et al 2017 or aldol condensation crosslinking wang et al 2020 zhang et al pointed out that pnf membrane assembled with non toxic stable and nonmetal g c3n4 based visible light photocatalyst achieved rapid development and exhibited good synergistic removal self cleaning and antibacterial activities for various dyes antibiotics and endocrine disruptors in water purification zhang et al 2021 however there are still some issues challenges for the known surface anchored visible light responsive pnf membranes that need to be addressed while continuing to improve their usability and effectiveness for one thing the performance testing of these pnf membranes usually adopted ex situ or static coupling process that is it only involved the simple integration of photocatalytic device and nanofiltration membrane module into a large reactor or the fouled membrane was taken off followed by illumination alone kumari et al 2020 in other words these operational steps of photocatalytic degradation and membrane separation were not performed under conditions where light driven and pressure driven acted simultaneously of course a few current studies have made progress in similar scenarios for instance lotfi et al customized a dynamic performance evaluator to allow continuous flow through operation under uv irradiation and achieved efficient degradation of steroid hormone micropollutants using photocatalytic microfiltration membrane lotfi et al 2022 for the other thing when removing target pollutants photocatalysis requires an effective reaction time about 15 120 min while membrane separation is accomplished within a short contact time which brings about a non negligible disturbance to realizing the energy saving of pnf membrane anyway these demands pose new challenges in terms of design and operation mode for pnf membrane performance evaluation instrument in addition most studies merely involved simulated feedwater or simple influent matrix ignoring the solute solute interaction and its effect occurring in the to be removed stage in practical water environment jiang et al 2016 finally to ensure the safety of purified water biotoxicity testing is also required to assess the associated health risk mitigation effect deng et al 2019 du et al 2017 in light of the above this study aims to explore the feasibility of bifunctional pnf membrane for simultaneously degrading and separating target antibiotics in sewage effluent in a continuous dynamic process firstly with a polyethylenimine pei based polyamide separation layer incorporating 0d quaternized carbon quantum dots qcds as the carrier a novel metal free and visible light responsive n doped carbon quantum dots ncqds modified g c3n4 surface anchored pnf membrane was fabricated by dip coating assisted vacuum filtration technique secondly their structure and properties of the relevant degradable and separating functional layers were exhaustively characterized finally the simultaneous removal self cleaning performances and environmental risk reduction characteristics of the resultant pnf membrane and its counterparts were systematically investigated in a continuous flow through process under visible light exposure it will provide useful insights for further improving the practicality and effectiveness of pnf membrane in real micro polluted water purification scenarios 2 experimental 2 1 materials and reagents one self made polysulfone hollow fiber uf membrane module with molecular weight cut off mwco of 40 kda and an effective surface area of 0 03 m2 was adopted for stringent pretreatment commercial polyethersulfone flat sheet substrate mwco 50 kda with pure water permeability of 136 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was obtained from risingsun membrane company beijing china urea citric acid monohydrate trimesoyl chloride tmc 98 0 pei 50 0 solution sodium dodecyl sulfate sds n hexane ethanol absolute dopamine hydrochloride da triethylenetetramine teta and na2co3 were all purchased from macklin china used to prepare pnf membrane other auxiliary reagents including tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris 99 8 betaine hydrochloride 99 0 isopropanol alcohol acetone and fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer i as well as high purity methanol 99 9 were supplied by aladdin china both frequently detected antibiotics with small molecular weights 300 da but markedly different physicochemical characteristics see table s1 comprising trimethoprim tmp and sulfamethoxazole smx were bought from tokyo chemical industry co ltd japan as target microcontaminants in this study the freeze dried virbrio qinghaiensis sp 67 q67 was ordered from hamamatsu beijing china ar grade reagents and deionized di water 1 9 μs cm 1 were used throughout the process unless specifically stated otherwise the simulated influent of pnf membrane was simply formed by spiking both target antibiotics together into milli q water 0 049 μs cm 1 with the aid of chromatographically pure methanol to achieve a fixed content of 1000 μg l 1 for each as for its real feedwater the secondary effluent after disinfection sampled from xiaoshangzhuang sewage treatment plant in xinxiang city its critical properties presented the first column in table 1 was pretreated by the aforementioned polysulfone uf module operated in a dead end mode to meet the requirements of the feedwater for subsequent permeable membrane then the selected antibiotics were added according to the scheme of configuring the simulated influent in the presence of multiple background matrices 2 2 synthesis of hnccns and fabrication of pnf membranes ncqds precursor was synthesized via a modified hydrothermal method wang et al 2017 and its structural formula was shown in fig s1 briefly 9 g citric acid and 3 g urea were mixed thoroughly in an appropriate amount of di water then the mixture was transferred to a teflon sealed autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 180 c for 5 h afterwards it was naturally cooled to room temperature and the reaped tan suspension was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min to remove impurities hereafter the gained 50 μl ncqds stock solution and 10 g urea were mixed into 40 ml di water to form a transparent solution accompanying by drying at 70 c for 24 h subsequently the resulting brown solid was heated to 550 c for 3 h at a heating rate of 15 c min 1 to obtain ncqds modified carbon nitride nccn as a synthetic intermediate liu et al 2019 finally the photocatalysts made by the high temperature secondary calcination at 550 c involving a heating rate of 5 c min 1 with different time 2 h 4 h 6 h were denoted as hnccn 2 hnccn 4 and hnccn 6 respectively in addition pure g c3n4 was prepared following the same synthetic route in the absence of ncqds and secondary calcination the schematic diagram of pnf membrane fabrication is illustrated in fig 1 primarily the pei based polyamide matrix incorporated with an appropriate amount of qcds as a separation functional layer was loaded onto the polyethersulfone substrate surface by interfacial polymerization referred to as nf qcds membrane song et al 2021b thereinto qcds was prepared by a one step pyrolysis using betaine hydrochloride and tris as raw materials on the basis of previous study bourlinos et al 2011 subsequently the degradation functional layer was anchored onto the top surface of the resultant nanocomposite membrane by polydopamine pda dip coating assisted vacuum filtration technique specifically this nanocomposite membrane was firstly immersed into a 2 g l 1 da solution containing 50 mm tris hcl buffer ph 8 5 and shaken at 25 c for 6 h as an adhesive between bifunctional layers next it was washed immediately by ethanol to eliminate the excess unreacted pda simultaneously an appropriate amount of the optimal hnccn 4 photocatalyst see fig s2 was dissolved in a mixture of water and ethanol with a certain volume ratio and then sonicated for 30 min afterwards 40 ml of the ten fold diluted supernatant was taken out doped with a certain concentration of teta as crosslinker and then vacuum filtrated through the above mentioned membrane top surface at 25 c finally the gained pnf membranes were baked at 60 c for 20 min and stored in di water for later use it should be stated that 4 6 40 mg l 1 and 0 1 wt were identified as the optimal volume ratio content of hnccn 4 and teta respectively according to their supernatant absorbance huang et al 2019 and removal performance orthogonal experimental results see figs s 3 and 4 incidentally the optimal bifunctional membrane prepared was denoted to be pnf 4 2 3 laboratory scale experimental set up a custom built integrated pnf membrane performance testing equipment was compactly placed in a photochemical reaction box cel lb70 ceaulight beijing as schematically shown in fig 2 its main components included a feedwater tank diving pump pressure gauge circular quartz membrane test cell with an effective area of 21 2 cm2 and permeate tank thereinto the membrane test cell adopted the flow direction from top to bottom so as to allow pnf membrane top surface to receive light radiation directly from a cross sectional point of view the cover of the membrane test cell with a total thickness of 2 5 cm consisted of a lower flow channel with a cavity thickness of merely 0 14 cm and an upper concentric circular condensation channel with a cavity thickness of 0 8 cm during the experiment iced water was continuously flowed through the condensing device by a peristaltic pump at the required rate so as to help pnf feedwater temperature to be maintained at 25 c all the time besides a 300 w xenon lamp cel pe300 ceaulight beijing with a 400 nm ultraviolet cutoff filter was placed directly above the test cell at a distance of 15 cm from the membrane surface the pnf apparatus was run on a semi closed loop mode with the retentate stream fully recycling back to the feedwater tank this made it feasible to precisely tune the degradation time of bifunctional pnf membrane under the situations of continuous flow through in situ and synchronization 2 4 experimental protocol before the removal performance test pnf membrane coupon was compacted at 4 bar for 2 h to reach a stable state flux then prior to light irradiation 2 l simulated or real influent was circulated inside the evaluator for 30 min at 1 bar to achieve the adsorption desorption equilibrium between the photocatalytic functional layer surface and target antibiotics liu et al 2020 subsequently the formal removal performance test of bifunctional pnf membrane integrating degradation and separation under the conditions of dynamic in situ and simultaneous occurrence on target antibiotics was carried out exposed to light at 6 bar lasted for 2 h finally 50 ml influent and permeate samples were collected and rapidly filtered through a 0 45 μm filter for measurement as control trials additional pnf 4 and nf qcds membrane coupons were also tested in the same way under darkness besides 3 cycle fouling and associated rinsing experiments were conducted under the same initial operating conditions as the removal performance test and only real influent with a high fouling propensity was involved every cycle comprised two steps 1 test ran for 24 h and the final membrane flux j f n n 1 2 3 was gained 2 physical cleaning with 300 ml di water lasted for 30 min and the recovered pure water flux j p n n 1 2 3 was measured corresponding fouling indexes including the flux recovery ratio frr total fouling ratio r t and irreversible fouling ratio r ir were calculated in accordance with the previous work liu et al 2020 besides water permeability l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was measured indirectly by weighing the mass of permeate at specified time intervals rejection of each phac component was obtained by the percentage of dividing the rejected concentration by the content in feed mutharasi et al 2020 2 5 characterization surface chemical components wettabilities roughnesses and surface cross sectional morphologies of both nf and pnf membranes were determined by atr ftir nexus usa xps escalab 250xi usa goniometer theta finland afm multimode 8 usa and fe sem jsm 6390lv japan respectively the thickness and distribution of proteins deposited onto the fouled rinsed membrane skin layers with the assistance of fluorescence dye were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm tcs sp8 mp germany as for their precursors the chemical structure elemental compositions surface morphologies and wettabilities of the relevant photocatalysts were also determined by the aforementioned atr ftir xps sem eds and contact angle analyzer respectively in addition the crystal structure pore

dilution multiple gb 11903 89 and nessler s reagent colorimetric methods respectively concentrations of target antibiotics were detected by a liquid chromatographic instrument alliance e2695 waters singapore the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3deem fluorescence spectra of wastewater samples were measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer fp 6500 jasco japan electron paramagnetic resonance epr bruker germany and radical scavenging tests were performed in order to identify the potential active species in the degradation the degradation intermediates of smx and tmp were detected by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms agilent usa 2 6 environmental risk and toxicity assessments to examine the safety of the as fabricated bifunctional pnf membrane for the efficient removal of target small sized antibiotics the risk quotient rq of each residual antibiotic in pnf permeate and its counterpart was calculated through eq 1 1 r q m e c a f e c 50 where mec is the measured environmental content af is a safety factor of 1000 and 100 for acute and chronic toxicity and ec50 is median effect concentration meanwhile the bioluminescence inhibition of q67 in the real secondary effluent before and after the resultant nf pnf membrane treatment was measured to investigate the toxicity reduction effect details of bacterial culture and acute chronic toxicity test were in accordance with the reported literature zhou et al 2010 the toxicity of nf qcds pnf 4 influent effluent sample on q67 was expressed as the inhibition rate e and calculated according to eq 2 2 e i 0 i i 0 100 where i0 and i present the average relative light unit of q67 exposed to the control and test substance 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of pnf membrane bifunctional layers the physicochemical crystal structure chemical environment specific surface area wettability and optical properties of the synthesized photocatalysts were characterized as shown in fig 3 it could be seen from fig 3a that all three photocatalyst samples were observed to have similar characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ 27 7 and 13 1 by xrd pattern thereinto the strong diffraction peak at 2θ 27 7 was indexed to the 002 crystal plane structure of g c3n4 jcpds no 87 1526 due to the periodic stacking of the conjugated aromatic system li et al 2016 while the weaker diffraction peak at 2θ 13 1 was assigned to 100 plane originated from the in planar arrangement of tri s triazine units besides compared with g c3n4 the xrd pattern of hnccn 4 was almost unchanged after successive modification by incorporating low amount of ncqds and secondary thermal oxidation indicating that hnccn 4 photocatalyst well inherits the inherent crystal structure of its precursor of course this is also inseparable from the low crystallinity and relatively small amount 1 wt of ncqds fig 3b shows atr ftir spectra of the as prepared photocatalysts strong absorption bands at 1000 1700 cm 1 were assigned to c n stretching vibrations in the cn heterocycles a sharp band at 806 cm 1 resulted from the breathing vibration pattern of s triazine unit while the wide bands at 3000 3400 cm 1 corresponded to the free amino and surface adsorbed hydroxyl groups compared with the spectra of pure g c3n4 and nccn a new absorption peak at 1680 cm 1 was detected in the spectrum of hnccn 4 which corresponds to c o stretching vibration in the amide bond verifying that the formation of covalent bonds between ncqds and urea derived g c3n4 through amide reaction after high temperature secondary calcination wang et al 2018 in addition these samples were further analyzed using xps to obtain the exact elemental content xps spectra fig 3c showed that the o content of g c3n4 was only 0 36 while that of nccn and hnccn 4 increased to 1 02 and 3 63 respectively this phenomenon may be due to the addition of ncqds riched in oxygen during the process of high temperature secondary calcination moreover the curve fitted high resolution scans for c 1s and n 1s of g c3n4 nccn and hnccn 4 samples depicted in fig s5 further verified our interpretation about atr ftir spectra pore size distribution and bet surface area were estimated by nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms as shown in fig 3d and table s2 clearly all samples showed typical iv a isotherm trend indicating that these photocatalysts are mesoporous materials more specifically hnccn 4 has the largest bet surface area as high as 177 8 m2 g 1 which is 2 32 times than that of unmodified g c3n4 hnccn 4 inherited its precursor mesoporous structure significantly larger than the sub nanopore structure of the corresponding separation layer and exhibited a higher pore volume and specific surface area which obviously endow the degradation functional layer of pnf 4 membrane with negligible hydraulic resistance and promising photocatalytic activity liu et al 2017 furthermore fe sem images and eds mapping of g c3n4 nccn and hnccn 4 see fig s6 also more intuitively confirmed the changing trend of their increasingly hollowed out 2d lamellar structure and successful modification vb xps uv vis drs and pl spectra were used to characterize the band structure and optical absorption capacities of g c3n4 nccn and hnccn 4 samples as shown in fig 3 e h the vb values of g c3n4 nccn and hnccn 4 were 1 85 ev 2 19 ev and 2 12 ev respectively compared with pure g c3n4 hnccn 4 exhibited broader absorption in the visible light region indicating that the incorporation of ncqds enhanced visible light utilization ability the band gap eg calculated by previous works bourlinos et al 2011 ni et al 2021 of hnccn 4 2 83 ev was slightly lower than that of g c3n4 2 86 ev and nccn 2 88 ev manifesting that only the participation of the high temperature secondary calcination could cause a mild reduction in the hybridization bandgap pl spectra showed that the emission peak intensity of hnccn 4 was significantly lower than that of g c3n4 or other counterparts indicating that the introduction of ncqds could effectively inhibit the recombination of photoexcited electron hole pairs both the red shift of visible light absorption edge and the remarkable suppression of charge carriers will eventually boost the photocatalytic activity of hnccn 4 ou yang et al 2021 in addition it can be seen from fig 3i that the static water contact angle ca detected at 10 s of hnccn 4 was 26 85º which was significantly lower than that of g c3n4 38 71º they are far superior to the hydrophilicity of the polymeric skin layer song et al 2021b which is bound to contribute to reducing the mass transfer resistance of water molecules and increasing the adhesion of the resultant pnf membrane top surface cross sectional chemical compositions wettabilities and morphologies of bifunctional layers of pnf 4 membrane were systematically characterized by atr ftir and xps spectra water ca sem and afm as shown in fig 4 compared with the spectrum of pes substrate two new absorption peaks of nf qcds membrane at 2927 cm 1 and 2854 cm 1 displayed in fig 4a could be ascribed to the stretching vibrations of excess primary and secondary amine groups from pei based polyamide matrix respectively song et al 2021b meanwhile except for a characteristic peak similar to nf qcds membrane observed at 2854 cm 1 there was no significant difference in the atr ftir spectra between pnf 4 membrane skin layer and hnccn 4 indicating that hnccn 4 photocatalyst was indeed successfully anchored onto pnf 4 membrane surface uniformly similarly xps results further confirmed the above speculation this was mainly reflected in the fact that the separation functional layer 5 1 1 exhibited the c n o atomic content ratio of the classical pei based polyamide while the degradation functional layer 14 11 1 had almost the same elemental ratio as the hnccn 4 photocatalyst 12 15 1 see fig 3c it was worth noting from fig 4c that water ca at 10 s decreased dramatically from 43 75º of nf qcds membrane to 29 05º of pnf 4 membrane again very close to the data of hnccn 4 sample indicating that pnf 4 membrane top surface is super hydrophilic as shown in fig 4d the fe sem topographic feature changed from ridge and valley structure for nf qcds membrane to relatively smooth surface for pnf 4 membrane which was qualitatively consistent with the 3d afm data in detail the root mean square roughness rms of pnf 4 membrane decreased from 9 34 0 35 nm of nf qcds membrane to 6 19 0 27 nm presumably due to the optimization of 2d nanosheet structured photocatalytic functional layer meanwhile the thickness of bifunctional layers restrainedly increased from 118 nm of the separation layer to 154 nm which indicated that the degradation functional layer made up of hnccn 4 photocatalyst surface anchored onto pnf membrane was only about 30 nm it is basically consistent with the eds mapping image depicted in fig s7 considering its mesoporous structure and super hydrophilic mentioned above it is conceivable that the additional hydraulic longitudinal resistance brought by the degradation functional layer could be tolerated to a certain extent taken together these desired structure and properties including the outside thinner smoother super hydrophilic mesoporous efficient degradation functional layer as well as the inside tight sub nanopore structured separation functional layer are bound to endow pnf 4 membrane with excellent simultaneous removal performance for target antibiotics in actual effluent 3 2 simultaneous removal performance of pnf membrane the removal performance of bifunctional pnf 4 membrane to target antibiotics was evaluated by measuring the permeability and removal rate involving both simulated and real feedwaters in a continuous flow through process under illumination as presented in figs 5 and 6 the removing data of it and nf qcds membrane loaded with only separation functional layer under dark condition are also plotted in fig 5 for comparison to quantify the contributions of the respective functional layers overall the remove rate sequences for selected antibiotics of three schemes were in the order of pnf 4 light pnf 4 dark nf qcds whether for simulated or real feedwater for instance in the case of simulated feedwater the removal rates against tmp and smx by pnf 4 light membrane were 99 4 and 99 1 respectively which were significantly higher than those by pnf 4 dark membrane 95 6 and 94 1 let alone nf qcds membrane 95 3 and 93 2 this clearly proves that bifunctional pnf 4 membrane could synergistically and efficiently reduce target antibiotics concentrations in the feedwater to below two orders of magnitude compared to the sole sub nanopore separation layer while the slight advantage of pnf 4 dark membrane is likely due to the adsorption of selected micropollutants by the hnccn 4 photocatalytic layer it was also found that the water permeability of pnf 4 23 64 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 after experiencing a slight decrease in darkness recovered to almost the same high level as that of unmodified nf qcds 23 78 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 membrane under irradiation this indicates that the mesoporous hnccn 4 photocatalyst anchored onto nf qcds membrane surface with a thickness of several tens of nanometers and the resultant pnf membrane hydrophilic modification might basically offset its own inherent hydraulic resistance wang et al 2021 especially when the activated degradation layer works in situ and synchronously the removal rate of positively charged tmp with relatively large steric hindrance was always higher than that of negatively charged smx in all schemes and this gap was compromised sharply for pnf 4 light membrane this may be due to the weakening of surface positive charge after nf qcds membrane modification it was also found that the removal rates of both selected antibiotics in practical water environment were always higher than those in ideal water environment especially in the scheme of nf qcds this is mainly due to the fact that apart from the freely dissolved state antibiotics in the actual sewage effluent also occurred in the forms of large sized dissolved organic matter dom associated and particle 0 45 μm associated states under the microscopic solute solute interaction lin et al 2021 undoubtedly the latter two species will effectively increase the steric hindrance of target antibiotics zhang et al 2022 thereby improving their apparent removal rates in terms of the degradation layer the dissolved organics in influent matrices could scavenge radicals and or block light penetration thus affecting the effectiveness of the degradable functional layer for the transformation of target antibiotics but the presence of such abundant electron rich background matrices would also enhance the formation and reactivity of useful radicals for elimination and alter the transformation pathways of selected micropollutants yang et al 2022 in order to clarify the evolution of categories during the removal of organics in real micro polluted sewage effluent by bifunctional pnf 4 membrane under the background of solute solute interaction the relevant 3deem spectra of the feed product samples were characterized as presented in fig 6 the secondary effluent was mainly rich in humic substances sited in regions iii and v several soluble microbial metabolites located in region iv and aromatic proteins sited in region ii ly et al 2018 truong et al 2020 but after adding trace amounts of target antibiotics the fluorescence characteristic peaks were all blue shifted accompanying the increasing intensity except for humic acids located in region v presumably due to the solute solute interaction between those antibiotics containing protein like structure see table s1 with the residual natural endogenous soluble organics assisted by the bridging effect of di multi valent cations wang et al 2016 from fig 6 c e it could be seen that there were sporadic fluorescence response signals in the permeate samples in both nf qcds and pnf 4 dark schemes while it magically presented a signal that was almost impossible to discover and very close to zero in pnf 4 light scheme to a certain extent this confirms the previously mentioned synergistic and efficient removal of target antibiotics by bifunctional pnf 4 membrane in a continuous flow through process under illumination 3 3 self cleaning performance of pnf membrane in general the antiadhesion membranes are expected to be fabricated by fit for purpose modification to weaken the interaction forces between the foulants and the membrane surface wang et al 2022 different from this one of the fascinating advantages of pnf membranes in service is that the deposited foulants could be photo degraded destroyed or even almost completely eliminated actively and simultaneously with the assistance of the outer photocatalytic functional layer shi et al 2019a for this purpose the stabilities in self cleaning performance of the resultant pnf 4 membrane and its counterparts tested with practical water were evaluated as shown in fig 7 it was discovered from fig 7a that after running for 24 h the normalized fluxes of nf qcds membrane pnf 4 membrane under darkness and illumination decreased by 8 8 10 and 3 6 respectively then after physical flushing with di water for 0 5 h permeabilities of these involved membranes recovered to 97 2 97 9 and 99 5 of their initial values respectively after repeating this fouling physical rinsing process three times the final r t and r ir see fig 7b decreased significantly from 17 3 and 8 2 18 7 and 7 5 of both nf qcds membrane and pnf 4 membrane without light irradiation to 7 2 and 1 2 of the latter one under visible light exposure undoubtedly pnf 4 membrane irradiated via visible light demonstrated impressive fouling resistance or more precisely self cleaning performance in a continuous flow through process especially featured in a very minor irreversible fouling rate the superior self cleaning property of pnf 4 membrane may be attributed to the enhanced antibiotic adsorption capacity promoted light harvesting ability and fast transfer of photo generated electrons at the outer degradation functional layer surface after combining figs s 8 and 9 it could be inferred target antibiotics are firstly degraded by the reactive oxygen species including oh and o2 generated by the outer photocatalytic layer before being further separated by the inner nanocomposite membrane as for the other two schemes with inferior anti fouling performance it was interestingly found that under darkness compared with nf qcds separating membrane the bifunctional pnf 4 membrane showed slightly lager flux decline ratio and r t but relatively lower r ir this may be due to the mutual compromise for the latter between the greatly increasing tendency to trap contaminants inside the extra mesoporous photocatalytic layer transport channels and the concurrently improved membrane surface hydrophilicity smoothness see fig 4c and f clsm and water ca were employed to further verify the above conjecture from other observational perspectives at the end of the fouling physical flushing test thereinto the former could accurately represent the spatial distribution of target antibiotics and other background matrices in secondary effluent with protein like structure mixed in the foulant layer it can be seen from fig 8 that the fouled pnf 4 membrane under darkness manifested the highest protein coverage ratio among three modes and thicker foulant layer substructure over 3 0 μm than that irradiated by visible light however the fouling layer thicknesses of all rinsed membranes were significantly differentiated that is following the order of nf qcds pnf 4 dark pnf 4 light from the perspective of the fluorescence intensity the above mentioned viewpoint will be further confirmed this is especially reflected in the fact that after the continuous flow through under irradiation the rinsed pnf 4 membrane surface only remains sporadic adherent contaminants these evidences together with the similar results of hydrophobicity incremental changes which are highly consistent with the macroscopic fouling resistance index again strongly demonstrate that pnf 4 membrane under visible light irradiation displays good self cleaning performance in a long running process especially when coupled with an inexpensive physical flushing step besides the relevant experimental data were comprehensively collected in table 2 used for the performance comparison with other state of the art catalytic membranes in current literatures for contaminants removal it was clear that the pnf 4 membrane prepared in this study had higher removal and adhesive capacities than most of its counterparts which further supports these viewpoints 3 4 environmental risk reduction performance rqs of both target antibiotics in the permeate samples in nf qcds pnf 4 dark and pnf 4 light schemes were evaluated based on their most sensitive ec 50 values in practical water environment as listed in fig 9 it can be seen that the rq values of tmp and smx were lower than 0 1 in all cases indicating that neither nf qcds nor pnf 4 product water has ecological risk to aquatic organisms li et al 2021 it s important to note that the rq values of tmp and smx of pnf 4 membrane irradiated via visible light were even as low as 6 28 10 4 and 2 76 10 4 respectively far below the low risk threshold the results demonstrated that the activated bifunctional pnf 4 membrane in a continuous flow through pattern could be used as an efficient and reliable tool to prevent or even eliminate further migration of target antibiotics in aquatic environment moreover the acute and chronic toxicities of the real feedwater namely sewage effluent meeting the national grade i a discharge standard and permeate samples in all schemes were evaluated by the luminescence inhibition rate of vibrio qinghaiensis sp q67 as shown in fig 10 clearly there were many significant changes in inhibition rate between the raw sewage effluent and all treated permeates for both the 0 25 h and 12 h tests to be more specific the actual feedwater sample still possessed non negligible inhibition ratio of 23 7 and 9 96 after 0 25 and 12 h of exposure respectively thus indeed requiring an in depth processing step that will act as a barrier while it was surprisingly found that the two indices of bifunctional pnf 4 membrane irradiated via visible light were as low as 2 22 and 0 45 respectively reducing by more than an order of magnitude when compared to its mother solution besides combined with the blank test results obtained from other two patterns it could be deduced that the dense nanocomposite separation layer provides greater contribution in terms of reducing feedwater toxicity than that of the hnccn 4 degradation layer especially for the acute one of course the activated outer photocatalytic functional layer showed an apparent continuous positive elimination suggesting that the transformation products induced less toxic effects than the native compounds in brief the resultant surface anchored pnf 4 membrane as a single step exhibited the outstanding capability of both removing target antibiotics and reducing the biotoxicity stemming from sewage effluent in a continuous flow through process under visible light exposure 4 conclusion in this research a novel metal free and visible light responsive n doped cqds modified g c3n4 surface anchored pnf membrane was fabricated and employed for simultaneously removing trace antibiotics in sewage effluent under the situation of continuous flow through the experimental results illustrated that different from its inside dense physical separation layer the outside super hydrophilic mesoporous degradation layer of bifunctional pnf 4 membrane displayed a negligible hydraulic resistance and better photocatalytic activity in the operation mode of flat sheet membrane module adopting a top down flow direction and semi closed loop both impressively simultaneous removal self cleaning performances and outstanding environmental risk reduction capacity of the resultant pnf 4 membrane were fulfilled under the conditions of dynamic in situ and visible light exposure more precisely bifunctional pnf 4 membrane could efficiently reduce tmp and smx concentrations to below two orders of magnitude whether for simulated or real feedwater accompanying with almost constant high water permeability of 23 64 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the fouled pnf 4 membrane irradiated by visible light manifested the lowest foulant coverage ratio among three modes and thinner foulant layer substructure over 3 0 μm than that under darkness meanwhile only sporadic adherent contaminants remained onto the rinsed pnf 4 light membrane surface moreover it was capable of sharply reducing the acute and chronic biotoxicities of raw sewage effluent to virbrio qinghaiensis sp 67 to 2 22 and 0 45 respectively as a single unit operated in a continuous flow through process its simultaneous removal self cleaning and environmental risk reduction performances on real sewage effluent are a contribution to the domain of water purification by pnf membrane the future work should be paid attention to strengthening the degradation capacity of surface anchored photocatalytic layer and expanding its adaptability to more target micro pollutants declaration of competing interest
